{"speaker": "", "title": "Data Labeling in Azure ML Studio", "videoId": "p-JJLqnk5TY", "description": "This video talks about the new ML assisted data labeling capability in Azure Machine Learning Studio. You can create a data labeling project and either label the data yourself, or take help of other domain experts to create labels for you. Multiple labelers can use browser based labeling tools and work in parallel. As human labelers create labels, an ML model is trained in the background and its output is used to accelerate the data labeling workflow in various ways such as active learning, task clustering, and pre-labeling. Finally, you can export the labels in different formats.\n\n00:32 \u2013 Introduction to data labeling\n01:55 \u2013 Creating a data labeling project in Azure ML Studio\n11:30 \u2013 Labeling the data yourself\n13:40 \u2013 Adding other labelers to your data labeling project\n15:15 \u2013 Labeling from the labeler portal\n16:30 \u2013 What is coming in future\n\nLearn More:\nLearn how to create data labeling project: https://aka.ms/GetLabels\nHow to label images: https://aka.ms/TagImages\n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show: https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe  \nCreate a Free account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/DLvML\nGet Started with Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/StartML\n\nFollow: https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\nFollow: https://twitter.com/ch9\nFollow: https://twitter.com/Azure\nFollow: https://twitter.com/msdev\n\n#ai #microsoftai"}
