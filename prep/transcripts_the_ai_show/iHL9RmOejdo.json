We'll also extract some audio components and use a generic classification model with Azure ML and its AutoML features. \n\nJump to:\n00:00 Welcome to the AI Show\n01:27 Intro to Audio analytics with Azure Automated ML\n03:02 Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) - Time Domain Signal to Frequency Domain Signal\n05:10 Spectogram of how the spectrum of of frequencies vary over time\n07:50 Demo - Music Genre Classification\n13:15 Creating a Chromagram\n14:05 Spectograms generation\n15:04 Music Genre Classification with Automated ML for Images\n16:34 Calling AutoML CV Model\n22:42 Demo 2\n25:29 Learn more\n\nRecommended resources: \nAutoML for Images doc https://aka.ms/AIShow/AutoML/AzureML\nAutoML for Images Algorithms https://aka.ms/AIShow/AutoMLImages/Algorithms\nAutoML for Images Tutorial https://aka.ms/AIShow/AutoMLImages/Tutorial\nCreate a Free account (Azure) https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\n\nConnect with Seth https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\n\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show https://aka.ms/AIShowsubscribe\nAI Show Playlist https://aka.ms/AIShowPlaylist\n\nJoin us every other Friday, for an AI Show livestream on Learn TV and YouTube https://aka.ms/LearnTV - https://aka.ms/AIShowLive"}
