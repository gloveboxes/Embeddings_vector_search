This collection of modules guides developers in creating production-ready Intelligent Video Applications (IVAs) that can apply optimized audio and computer vision AI models to multiple input sources using features available in the latest release of the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK. Developers will learn how to build cross-platform container workloads that can be deployed to server or edge hardware using the DeepStream Graph Composer development environment. \n\nJump to: \n00:00 AI Show begins\n00:22 Welcome Alvin and Paul\n01:23 What is NVIDIA DeepStream SDK: Accelerated & Optimized Applications from Edge to Cloud\n06:50 Developing with DeepStream\n09:00 NVIDIA DeepStream Graph Composer demo\n14:37 NVIDIA DeepStream Development Learning Path https://aka.ms/AIShow/NVIDIA/DeepStreamDevelopment\n17:00 Learn More https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk\n17:51 Overview: NVIDIA DeepStream development with Microsoft Azure Learning Path\n\nLearn more:\nNVIDIA DeepStream Development with Microsoft Azure \nhttps://aka.ms/AIShow/NVIDIA/DeepStreamDevelopment\nDeepStream SDK https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk\nZero to Hero Azure AI https://aka.ms/ZerotoHero/AzureAI\nMachine Learning for Data Scientists https://aka.ms/AIShow/MLforDataScientists\nCreate a Free account (Azure) https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\n\nConnect with Seth https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\nConnect with NVIDIA https://twitter.com/nvidia\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show https://aka.ms/AIShowsubscribe\nAI Show Playlist https://aka.ms/AIShowPlaylist\n\nJoin us every other Friday, for an AI Show livestream on Learn TV and YouTube https://aka.ms/LearnTV - https://aka.ms/AIShowLive"}
