Custom adapters, in the Bot Framework SDK and from the Bot Framework Community, exist today that allow you to build a bot for platforms like WeChat, Alexa, Google Assistant, Twitter and more. This episode will show you how easy it is to hook up a custom adapter to your bot and how easy it is to get started.\n\nJump To: \n[00:30] \u2013 What are Bot Framework Channels\n[02:00] \u2013 What are custom adapters?\n[05:00] \u2013 Using a custom adapter in a bot.\n[06:20] \u2013 Demo communicating with a bot from Alexa Skill Console\n[8:30] \u2013 Getting started with Microsoft Docs and Bot Builder Community\n\nFor More Info:\nBot Framework SDK- https://aka.ms/BotFrameworkSDK \n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show: https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe  \nCreate a Free account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/DLvML\nGet Started with Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/StartML \nFollow: https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\nFollow: https://twitter.com/ch9\nFollow: https://twitter.com/Azure\nFollow: https://twitter.com/msdev\nFollow: https://twitter.com/garypretty\nFollow: https://twitter.com/msbotframework"}
