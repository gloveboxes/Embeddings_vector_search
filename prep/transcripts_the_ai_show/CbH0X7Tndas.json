{"speaker": "Seth", "title": "Azure ML Data Prep GUI, Its Not Just About The Code", "videoId": "CbH0X7Tndas", "description": "While lots of people like to do their data prep in code some tasks are faster and more easily done in a GUI, what\u2019s even better is a set of capabilities where you can pick and choose when and how to work in code and when to work in a GUI that work together. This show will demonstrate how we make Seth\u2019s life easier and faster in terms of data prep, allowing him to focus his nerdiness on modelling.\n\nGetting Started docs for the SDK are here https://github.com/Microsoft/MSDataPrepDocs\n\nAccess to the GUI is restricted preview right now, customers can send mail to amldataprep@microsoft.com and someone will get back to you to see if you are a candidate."}
