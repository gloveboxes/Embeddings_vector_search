{"speaker": "Serge Retkowsky", "title": "Visual Search Toolkit with Azure AI", "videoId": "ZEwaqkMkLUY", "description": "Our friend, Serge Retkowsky, is back to demo how Azure AI techniques can be used for visual search applications to find similar products just using an image. Using Open AI Clip vec2text, Azure Read API extracts any text from the images and a Python package detects and extracts any information in a barcode or QRcode from the image. All the results are processed and then ingested into an Azure Cognitive Search index for handling the requests. Visual Search uses Open AI Clip, Azure Cognitive Services and Azure Cognitive Search. \n\nChapters:\n00:00 Welcome to the AI Show\n00:30 Welcome Serge\n01:10 What is Visual Search\n03:40 Visual Search Toolkit with Azure AI Overview\n17:05 Visual Search Toolkit Repo\n18:10 Process recap\n21:43 Wrap\n\nLearn more:\nRepo https://aka.ms/VisualSearchToolkit\n\nConnect:\nSeth | https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\n\nSubscribe to the AI Show: https://aka.ms/AIShowsubscribe\nAI Show Playlist: https://aka.ms/AIShowPlaylist\nJoin us every other Friday, for an AI Show livestream on YouTube https://aka.ms/AIShowLive"}
