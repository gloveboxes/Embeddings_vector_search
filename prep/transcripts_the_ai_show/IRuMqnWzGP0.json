{"speaker": "", "title": "AI Show: Time Series Forecasting with Automated Machine Learning", "videoId": "IRuMqnWzGP0", "description": "Building forecasts is an integral part of any business, whether it's revenue, inventory, sales, or customer demand. Building machine learning models is time-consuming and complex with many factors to consider, such as iterating through algorithms, tuning your hyperparameters and feature engineering. These choices multiply with time series data, with additional considerations of trends, seasonality, holidays and effectively splitting training data. Forecasting within automated machine learning (ML) takes these factors into consideration and includes capabilities that improve the accuracy and performance of our recommended models. This session will highlight the forecasting features of Automated ML and how to leverage them.\n\nJump To: \n[00:35] \u2013 What is time-series forecasting?\n[01:30] \u2013 Simplify ML with Automated ML\n[02:30] \u2013 DriveTime customer scenario\n[04:15] \u2013 Features & Functionality\n[05:20] \u2013 Demo\n\nLearn More: \nWhat Is Auto Machine Learning  https://aka.ms/WhatisAutoML\nTime-Series Forecast Model https://aka.ms/TimeSeriesForecastModel\n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show: https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe  \nCreate a Free account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/DLvML\nGet Started with Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/StartML\nFollow: https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\nFollow: https://twitter.com/ch9\nFollow: https://twitter.com/Azure\nFollow: https://twitter.com/msdev"}
