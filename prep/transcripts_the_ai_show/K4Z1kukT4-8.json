Part 1[https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/An-Intuitive-Approach-to-Machine-Learning-Models-Part-1-of-4], Part 2 [https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/Optimization-Machine-Learning-Models-and-TensorFlow-Part-2-of-4]  and Part 3 [https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/Toronto-AI-User-Group-Keynote-Part-3-of-4]  were all about the foundations of machine learning, optimization, models, and even machine learning in the cloud. In this video I show an actual machine learning problem (see the GitHub repo for the code https://aka.ms/GitHub/CloudScaleML) that does the important job of distinguishing between tacos and burritos (an important problem to be sure). The primary concepts included is MLOps both on the machine learning side as well as the deliver side in Azure Machine Learning and Azure DevOps respectively. \n\n[00:28] Tacos vs burritos \n[04:15] Prep, Train, and export model\n[13:43] Machine learning pipelines\n[14:46] MLOps \n\nHope you enjoy the final of the series, Part 4!
