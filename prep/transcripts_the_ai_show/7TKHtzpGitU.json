Traditionally the hardware to run these models on the edge has been powerful, with GPUs or compute sticks. But what if you could run a model in only a few kilobytes of memory on a tiny micro-controller drawing less than a milliwatt of power? In this video we look at doing just that, training a wake word model in the cloud using Azure ML Studio, then compressing it to 18KB and running it on an Adafruit EdgeBadge, a small, low-powered micro-controller based device.\n\nJump To: \n[02:00] \u2013 The history of IoT\n[04:25] \u2013 Intro to TinyML\n[05:12] \u2013 Intro to the EdgeBadge\n[06:04] \u2013 Training the model\n[08:03] \u2013 Demoing the notebook\n[10:12] \u2013 Using VS Code to program the EdgeBadge\n[11:41] \u2013 Demo the wake word\n\nLearn More: \nAdafruit Edge Badge https://aka.ms/AdafruitEdgeBadge\nAll the Conent you need to Create a sample https://aka.ms/EdgeBadgeSampleCreating\nFollow: https://twitter.com/JimBobBennett\n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show: https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe  \nCreate a Free account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/DLvML\nGet Started with Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/StartML\nFollow: https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\nFollow: https://twitter.com/ch9\nFollow: https://twitter.com/Azure\nFollow: https://twitter.com/msdev"}
