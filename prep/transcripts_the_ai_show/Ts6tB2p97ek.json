Fairlearn focuses on negative impacts for\u202fgroups of people, such as those defined in terms of race, gender, age, or disability status.\n\u202f\nThere are two components to Fairlearn: The first is an\u202fassessment dashboard,\u202fwith both high-level and detailed views, for\u202fassessing\u202fwhich\u202fgroups\u202fare negatively\u202fimpacted. The second is a set of\u202fstrategies\u202ffor\u202fmitigating\u202ffairness issues. These strategies\u202fare\u202feasy\u202fto incorporate into existing machine-learning pipelines.\u202fTogether, these components empower\u202fdata scientists\u202fand\u202fbusiness leaders\u202fto navigate\u202fany\u202ftrade-offs\u202fbetween\u202ffairness\u202fand\u202fperformance,\u202fand to select the mitigation strategy that best fits their needs.\n\nLearn More: \nAzure Blog  https://aka.ms/AiShow/AzureBlog\nResponsible ML https://aka.ms/AiShow/ResponsibleML\nAzure ML  https://aka.ms/AiShow/AzureMLResponsibleML\n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show   https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe\nCreate a Free account (Azure)  https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree"}
