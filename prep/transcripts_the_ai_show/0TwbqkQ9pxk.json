Part 1  [https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/An-Intuitive-Approach-to-Machine-Learning-Models-Part-1-of-4] and Part 2 [https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/Optimization-Machine-Learning-Models-and-TensorFlow-Part-2-of-4]  introduce basic machine learning concepts as well as specific models using TensorFlow respectively. In this video we go more in depth into an example of a common data science process, how convolutions work in convolutional neural networks, and finally how this can be done in the cloud using Azure Machine Learning. \n\n[00:15] Data science process \n[03:25] Convolutions \n[05:52] Convolutional neural networks\n[07:20] Intro to machine learning on the cloud \n\nHope you enjoy Part 3!
