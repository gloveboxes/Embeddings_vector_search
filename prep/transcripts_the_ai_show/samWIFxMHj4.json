{"speaker": "PSI", "title": "Simplifying Machine Learning with Automated ML", "videoId": "samWIFxMHj4", "description": "Building accurate machine learning models requires a deep understanding of machine learning, as well as other data science and coding skills. Automated machine learning's purpose is to alleviate these requirements, automating the ML workflow of data cleansing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment. Enabling business domain experts to leverage ML in their day to day work using the web UI without writing a single line of code, as well as optimizing data scientists work by automating part of the technical work.\n\nJump To: \n00:55 - Start an Automated ML Experiment\n03:07 - Analyze experiment outputs and deploy recommended model\n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show: https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe  \nCreate a Free account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/DLvML\nGet Started with Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/StartML\n\nFollow: https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\nFollow: https://twitter.com/ch9\nFollow: https://twitter.com/Azure\nFollow: https://twitter.com/msdev\n\n#ai #microsoftai #automatedml"}
