We will use Custom Vision from Azure Cognitive Services to train an image classifier for a particular camera, and export that ONNX model to run locally on an IoT device. Our device will send events back to Azure IoT Hub. The end to end code is available on GitHub for your to try along at home.\n\nLearn More: \nVisual Intelligence: https://aka.ms/visualintelligence \nDocs: Cognitive Services Vision Solution Templates: https://aka.ms/visionsolutiontemplates \nDocs: Custom Vision: https://aka.ms/customvisiondocs \nIot Visual Alerts:  http://aka.ms/iotvisualalerts\nFollow: https://twitter.com/AnnaSRoth\n\n 01:16 - Visual Alerts Demo Intro \n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show: https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe  \nCreate a Free account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/DLvML\nGet Started with Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/StartML\nFollow: https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\nFollow: https://twitter.com/ch9\nFollow: https://twitter.com/Azure\nFollow: https://twitter.com/msdev\n\n#customvisionmicrosoft #microsoftai #azureiot"}
