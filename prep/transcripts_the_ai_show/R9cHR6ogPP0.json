{"speaker": "Seth Juarez", "title": "Optimization, Machine Learning Models, and TensorFlow (Part 2 of 4)", "videoId": "R9cHR6ogPP0", "description": "This is Part 2 of a four-part series that breaks up a talk that I gave at the Toronto AI Meetup. Part 1 [https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/An-Intuitive-Approach-to-Machine-Learning-Models-Part-1-of-4]  was all about the foundational concepts of machine learning. In this part I get into more advanced machine learning concepts. These include:  \n\n[00:13] Optimization (I explain calculus!!!) \n[04:40] Gradient descent \n[06:26] Perceptron (or linear models \u2013 we learned what these are in part 1 but I expound a bit more) \n[07:04] Neural Networks (as an extension to linear models)\n[09:28] Brief Review of TensorFlow\n\nHope you enjoy Part 2! As always feel free to send any feedback or add any comments below if you have any questions.\n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show: https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe  \nCreate a Free account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/AIShow/DLvML\nGet Started with Machine Learning:  \nhttps://aka.ms/AIShow/StartML\n\nFollow: https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\nFollow: https://twitter.com/ch9\nFollow: https://twitter.com/Azure\nFollow: https://twitter.com/msdev"}
