In this show, you\u2019ll see us train, optimize and deploy a deep learning model using Azure Notebooks, Azure Machine Learning Service, and Visual Studio Code using Python. We use transfer learning to retrain a mobilenet model using Tensorflow to recognize dog and cat breeds using the Oxford IIIT Pet Dataset. Next, we\u2019ll optimize that model using the Azure Machine Learning Service HyperDrive service, and improve the accuracy of our model to over 90%. Finally, we\u2019ll put on our developer hat, and use Visual Studio Code and our Python Extension to deploy and test our model. Along the way you\u2019ll see cool features like our new Jupyter-powered interactive programming experience in VS Code, our AI powered IntelliSense feature called Intellicode, and our Azure Machine Learning extension.\n\nLinks:\nBlog post introducing the new features in Azure Notebooks: https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureNotebooks/wiki/Azure-Notebooks-at-Microsoft-Connect()-2018 \nBlog post introducing our data science features in our Python extension: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pythonengineering/2018/11/08/data-science-with-python-in-visual-studio-code/ \nAzure Notebooks: https://notebooks.azure.com\nPython Extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python \nAzure Machine Learning Extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vscode-ai \nVisual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/\n\n#azuremachinelearning #microsoftai #ai"}
