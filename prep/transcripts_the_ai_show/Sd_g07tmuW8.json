This will be a discussion on how you can enable your enterprise and customers to find the right information quickly by using an engine that understands the meaning of words, not just syntax/lexical analysis.\n \nWe\u2019ll explain how the system works, answer your questions, demo the capability and discuss its value. While we will use state of the art deep learning models, no prior machine learning background is required.\n\nJump to:\n[00:00] Livestream begins\n[01:00] What is Azure cognitive search\n[02:58] What\u2019s new in semantic search \n[09:36] Leveraging state of the art deep neural networks from Bing, and democratizing through Azure \n[11:01] Demo\n[18:34] How do you enable this for your service\n\nLearn more:\nSemantic Search Documentation https://aka.ms/semanticsearchdocs \nSemantic Search Preview (form) http://aka.ms/semanticpreview\nACOM page https://aka.ms/AIShow/Search\nAzure Blog https://aka.ms/AIShow/ApplyAIBlog\nSemantic Search Blog: https://aka.ms/AIShow/SemanticSearchBlog\nAzure Cognitive Search AMA Mar 10 9am pacific: https://aka.ms/AzureCognitiveSearchAMA\n\nCreate a free account (Azure) https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show - https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe\nJoin us every other Friday for an AI Show livestream on Learn TV and YouTube - https://aka.ms/aishow"}
