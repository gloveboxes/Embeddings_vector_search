Our last episode (https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show/Anomaly-Detector-v10-Best-Practices) has shared several useful tips when you are designing your monitoring application architecture. In this episode, we're building an end-to-end solution using Anomaly Detector and Azure Databricks step by step. This solution will be able to detect numerical anomalies from streaming data coming through Azure Event Hubs.\n\nAdditional Information Links:\nCheck out the detailed tutorial for the solution we've built in this episode from https://aka.ms/adTutorialADB.\nCheck out a simple demo on https://aka.ms/adDemo\nCheck out the overview of the API service on https://aka.ms/AnomalyDetector.\nCreate your first Anomaly Detector resource on Azure: https://aka.ms/adNew.\nJoin Anomaly Detector Containers preview through https://aka.ms/adContainer.\nJoin \"Anomaly Detector Advisors\" public community to connect with the product team and other members in the community through https://aka.ms/adAdvisorsJoin.\n\nRe-Visit Your Favorite Part of the Video:\n00:74 - The business problem of the demo solution.\n01:18 - The architecture of the solution.\n02:25 - Solution prerequisites and resource setup.\n06:11 - Code walkthrough of sending tweets to Event Hubs.\n07:08 - Code walkthrough of reading tweets from Event Hubs.\n09:25 - Code walkthrough of data aggregation and storing to delta.\n11:28 - Code walkthrough of anomaly detection with Anomaly Detector.\n\nThe AI Show\u2019s Favorite Links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show: https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/AI-Show?ocid=AID2463683&wt.mc_id=ai-c9-sejuare\nCreate a Free account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aishowazurefree \nFollow Seth on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\nAI Blog: https://openai.com/blog/\nFast ML: http://fastml.com/\nMIT News | AI: https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\nMedium | Francesca Lazzeri: https://medium.com/@francescalazzeri\nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-deep-learning-vs-machine-learning?WT.mc_id=docs-article-lazzeri\nFollow Channel 9 On Twitter: https://twitter.com/ch9 \n\n#azuredatabricks #anomalydetection #artificialintelligence"}
