In this AI show, you will learn about Fairlearn, a community-driven open source machine learning fairness toolkit that empowers developers of artificial intelligence systems to assess their systems' fairness and mitigate any observed fairness issues.  Fairlearn focuses on negative impacts for groups of people, such as those defined in terms of race, gender, age, or disability status.\n\nJump To: \n[01:27] Fairness in AI\n[02:59] What causes unfairness in AI systems?\n[05:35] Fairlearn components\n[10:54] Demo start\n[24:25] Fairlearn in Azure Machine Learning\n\nLearn More: \nFairlearn GitHub https://aka.ms/AIShow/FairlearnGitHub\nFairlearn  https://aka.ms/AIShow/Fairlearn\n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show: https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe  \nCreate a Free account (Azure): https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree\nDeep Learning vs. Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/deeplearningmachinelea...\nGet Started with Machine Learning: https://aka.ms/GetStartedWithMachineL... \nFollow: https://twitter.com/sethjuarez\nFollow: https://twitter.com/ch9\nFollow: https://twitter.com/Azure\nFollow: https://twitter.com/msdev"}
