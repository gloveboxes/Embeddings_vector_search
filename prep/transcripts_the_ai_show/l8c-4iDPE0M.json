Automated ML builds a set of ML models automatically, intelligently selecting models for training and then recommends the best one for you. Traditional machine learning model development is resource-intensive requiring significant domain knowledge and time to produce and compare dozens of models. With automated ML, you'll accelerate the time it takes to get production-ready ML models with great ease and efficiency.\n\nTry a tutorial on automated ML: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/tutorial-auto-train-models"}
