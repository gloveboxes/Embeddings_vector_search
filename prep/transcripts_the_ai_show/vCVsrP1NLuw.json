{"speaker": "Aniththa Umamahesan", "title": "Learn how to be a ML Hero using AutoML", "videoId": "vCVsrP1NLuw", "description": "Automated ML is an emerging field in Machine Learning that helps data scientists to improve their productivity while also helping developers with little data science knowledge to build Machine Learning models and solutions without understanding the complexity of training algorithm selection, configuration, and hyperparameter tuning. With Azure Machine Learning's capabilities, given a dataset and a few configuration parameters such as the ML problem you want to solve, you will get a trained high quality machine learning model that you can use for making predictions. In this session, you will learn how to use Automated ML (with the SDK and the UI) while identifying the best approaches and tools to use depending on your scenario.\n\nThe AI Show's Favorite links:\nDon't miss new episodes, subscribe to the AI Show   https://aka.ms/aishowsubscribe\nCreate a Free account (Azure)  https://aka.ms/aishow-seth-azurefree"}
