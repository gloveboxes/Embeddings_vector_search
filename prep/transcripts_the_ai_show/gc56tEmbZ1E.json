{"speaker": "Seth Juarez", "title": "Machine Learning Models", "videoId": "gc56tEmbZ1E", "description": "https://aka.ms/MachineLearningModels\nMachine Learning is sometimes confusing. From the esoteric terms to elevated expositions it seems like a terribly difficult area to get into. Since I started as a developer I totally get the mismatch! In this episode we tackle the one term that is used all of the time in Machine Learning: the elusive \"model.\" First we set up how machine learning is different, how to think about it, and finally what a model actually is (spoiler alert - think \"a function written a different way\"). Would love your feedback!\n\n#machinelearning #microsoftai #aiml"}
