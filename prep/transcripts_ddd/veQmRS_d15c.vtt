00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:31.518
Caption: first of all i&#39;d like to take a moment

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.959
Caption: to thank our sponsors for giving me the

00:00:31.518 --> 00:00:34.959
Caption: opportunity to speak today

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.238
Caption: on this slide we have a photo of the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.840
Caption: wilson parking app running on carplay

00:00:40.238 --> 00:00:42.718
Caption: this is the second parking app in the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.680
Caption: world

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.000
Caption: it was so close to being the first

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.760
Caption: i implemented this functionality and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.360
Caption: during this presentation i am going to

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:53.359
Caption: show you how to build a carplay app

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.399
Caption: most new cars have started supporting

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.079
Caption: carplay

00:00:58.398 --> 00:01:01.759
Caption: this integrates your iphone&#39;s operating

00:01:00.078 --> 00:01:05.040
Caption: system with your car&#39;s infotainment

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:06.959
Caption: system the touchscreen in your car

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.479
Caption: once you plug your iphone in to your car

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:10.319
Caption: via usb

00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:11.839
Caption: a carplay version of the iphone&#39;s

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:14.000
Caption: operating system will be displayed on

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:15.599
Caption: your car&#39;s touchscreen

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.519
Caption: this will only include apps which

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:19.599
Caption: support carplay

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:22.319
Caption: i personally use spotify and maps most

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:23.919
Caption: of the time when i&#39;m driving

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.239
Caption: there&#39;s a single app which runs on your

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:27.839
Caption: iphone

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:29.519
Caption: carplay is treated as an external

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:31.359
Caption: display

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:33.279
Caption: and has its own ui independent of the

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.959
Caption: iphone&#39;s ui

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:37.360
Caption: all the processing is still done on the

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.360
Caption: iphone

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.360
Caption: carplay is an apple system and will only

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.959
Caption: work with iphones

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.119
Caption: android has a different system called

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:49.438
Caption: android auto this presentation is

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.439
Caption: focused on the apple carplay system

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.360
Caption: apple only allows a small handful of app

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:57.758
Caption: categories to support carplay originally

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.719
Caption: back in 2014 when one carplay first

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.479
Caption: launched

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.639
Caption: this was just audio navigation and

00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:05.519
Caption: communication apps

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:08.479
Caption: last year as part of the ios 14 release

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:10.559
Caption: apple changed the way carplay works

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.639
Caption: and expand the supported categories to

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:15.279
Caption: include ev charging parking and quick

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.279
Caption: food ordering

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:20.000
Caption: most ui frameworks let you create

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:22.720
Caption: screens by nesting and arranging

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.958
Caption: components as you like in order to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.720
Caption: ensure carplay apps remain safe to use

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.520
Caption: in the complex driving environment this

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.919
Caption: is a lot more restrictive

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.400
Caption: instead carplay apps

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:36.639
Caption: oh sorry i&#39;ll scratch that instead

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:39.518
Caption: carplay screens are created from a fixed

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.518
Caption: set of templates

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:46.720
Caption: there are some examples on this slide

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.399
Caption: and there are more available

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.559
Caption: the carplay app programming guide

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:52.958
Caption: contains documents all the templates

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:52.958
Caption: available

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:58.399
Caption: carplay apps decide when a template is

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.639
Caption: is displayed on the screen and what data

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:02.878
Caption: is shown the template handles everything

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.878
Caption: else

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.878
Caption: oh

00:03:04.158 --> 00:03:06.878
Caption: sorry um

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:21.119
Caption: so i&#39;ve just come back um

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.878
Caption: ah

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:23.919
Caption: all carplay apps will look and feel the

00:03:22.878 --> 00:03:26.158
Caption: same

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:28.639
Caption: as templates provide no styling options

00:03:26.158 --> 00:03:31.119
Caption: except in our cases this is great as all

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.319
Caption: carplay apps will um this is great as

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.080
Caption: you can achieve a lot with a small

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.679
Caption: amount of code

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.839
Caption: the downside is you can only do what the

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:40.319
Caption: templates provide

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:42.399
Caption: user input is also very limited in

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.919
Caption: carplay there there are no text fields

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:45.439
Caption: there is no keyboard

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.039
Caption: templates only provide pressable

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.319
Caption: controls like buttons

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.878
Caption: and siri can be used for more

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.559
Caption: complicated inputs

00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:54.639
Caption: your carplay app will also determine

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:56.319
Caption: which templates it has access to some

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.080
Caption: templates like the list can be used by

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.279
Caption: all car players

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.360
Caption: other templates like the point of

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:04.158
Caption: interest can only be used by ev charging

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.639
Caption: parking and quick food ordering apps

00:04:04.158 --> 00:04:08.399
Caption: the carplay app programming guide

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:12.000
Caption: will tell you which

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:12.000
Caption: templates your app has access to

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.239
Caption: templates only display a small amount of

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:18.160
Caption: information

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.720
Caption: for example this template will display a

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.040
Caption: maximum of 12 items each item will have

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.040
Caption: a title a subtitle and maybe an image

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:29.679
Caption: carplay uses a stack for navigation and

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:31.758
Caption: also limits the number of templates

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:34.239
Caption: which can go on the stack

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.479
Caption: the quick food ordering apps can only

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:37.918
Caption: have two templates on this stack whereas

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.839
Caption: all other carplay apps can have a

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.839
Caption: maximum of five templates on this stack

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.479
Caption: apple defines a bunch of guidelines

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.479
Caption: which ios apps must follow

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.639
Caption: when you have finished your app and are

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:54.319
Caption: ready to submit to the store apple will

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.240
Caption: check your app to ensure it follows

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.080
Caption: these guidelines if they think you have

00:04:56.239 --> 00:05:00.000
Caption: breached a guideline your submission

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:02.079
Caption: will be rejected

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.039
Caption: carplay has its own set of guidelines

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:05.039
Caption: which must be followed

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.360
Caption: i will not bore you today by going over

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.720
Caption: all of the carplay guidelines

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:13.679
Caption: and instead have selected some of the

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.199
Caption: main ones which i&#39;ll go over

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.559
Caption: the best place to check all of these

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.039
Caption: guidelines is the carplay out

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:20.039
Caption: programming guide

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.320
Caption: the first one

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:32.559
Caption: essentially means

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.639
Caption: that your app must provide appropriate

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:36.639
Caption: functionality for its category

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.839
Caption: so a parking app is expected to provide

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.839
Caption: some sort of parking service

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.360
Caption: all carplay flows must be meaningful to

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.360
Caption: use whilst driving

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:49.440
Caption: apple doesn&#39;t apple only wants us to

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.720
Caption: include a feature in carplay if it&#39;s

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.399
Caption: called to the app and make sense to

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.160
Caption: perform whilst driving features like

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:56.000
Caption: maintenance unrelated settings and

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.600
Caption: filling out forms should be left to be

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.639
Caption: done on the iphone when it is safe to

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.639
Caption: perform these tasks

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:04.478
Caption: all carplay flows must be possible

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:06.000
Caption: without interacting with the iphone

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.360
Caption: templates do not provide the same

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.399
Caption: functionality as what can be done on the

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:09.918
Caption: iphone

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:12.000
Caption: you&#39;re not allowed to launch a screen on

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.440
Caption: the iphone to continue your flow instead

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.039
Caption: you have to look at either changing your

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.720
Caption: carplay flow so that it will work

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:18.880
Caption: entirely and carefully or remove that

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.079
Caption: feature from carplay

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.959
Caption: and finally you&#39;re not allowed to

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:25.599
Caption: instruct a user to to manipulate their

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:26.638
Caption: iphone to perform a task

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.319
Caption: and

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.919
Caption: you can quite common uh so um

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.679
Caption: common error conditions can easily be

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.360
Caption: resolved by performing a task on an

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:37.039
Caption: iphone for example

00:06:35.359 --> 00:06:39.519
Caption: a user not being logged in you can

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:41.440
Caption: simply prompt the user to log in

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:44.720
Caption: on carplay you&#39;re not you are not

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.239
Caption: allowed to instruct the user to log in

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.319
Caption: instead you have to be clever about your

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:50.319
Caption: error message indicating something is

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.959
Caption: wrong without tempting the user to touch

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.959
Caption: their iphone

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:57.279
Caption: before we jump into the code i&#39;m going

00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:59.039
Caption: to go over the scope of the app we&#39;re

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:00.799
Caption: going to build today first of all we are

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.399
Caption: going to make a parking app

00:07:00.799 --> 00:07:04.079
Caption: this is because we get access to the

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:06.319
Caption: point of interest template which is

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:08.638
Caption: flashy and great for a demo

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:10.079
Caption: we&#39;re going to need an iphone ui

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:13.039
Caption: in our case it&#39;s going to be very

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:15.359
Caption: complex and display hello world

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:17.598
Caption: our carplay ui is going to display us

00:07:15.359 --> 00:07:19.198
Caption: car parks nearby allow us to select a

00:07:17.598 --> 00:07:22.000
Caption: car park and navigate to a screen for

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:22.000
Caption: more information

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:25.679
Caption: before we can start creating carplay

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.959
Caption: functionality we first need an iphone

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:28.639
Caption: app

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:31.039
Caption: in our case we&#39;re going to use the one

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:33.679
Caption: auto generated by xcode using swift and

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:35.440
Caption: ios 14.

00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:37.359
Caption: our appdelegate class has been already

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.440
Caption: generated for us

00:07:37.359 --> 00:07:41.038
Caption: this manages the lifecycle of the app

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.399
Caption: and is the entry point for when the app

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:45.759
Caption: starts

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:47.679
Caption: all this does oh sorry well currently

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:51.440
Caption: all this does is return

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:51.440
Caption: our iphone scene configuration

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:55.598
Caption: our iphone scene configuration

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:57.520
Caption: will create this

00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:59.839
Caption: scene delegate which manages the life

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:02.079
Caption: cycle of the iphone&#39;s ui

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:04.559
Caption: all this does is

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:06.239
Caption: create a window and populate it with the

00:08:04.559 --> 00:08:08.559
Caption: content view which will display hello

00:08:06.239 --> 00:08:08.559
Caption: world

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.039
Caption: this scene delegate currently uses a

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:15.598
Caption: swift window but we could change this to

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:16.799
Caption: use whatever technology your iphone ui

00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:19.279
Caption: is rendered in

00:08:16.799 --> 00:08:21.039
Caption: the wilson parking app uses react native

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:23.440
Caption: to render its iphone

00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:23.440
Caption: ui

00:08:23.598 --> 00:08:26.479
Caption: react native is a lot more complicated

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:28.319
Caption: to set up and if you would like

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:29.679
Caption: information about this i have written a

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:32.719
Caption: blog post which will be shared at the

00:08:29.679 --> 00:08:32.719
Caption: end of this presentation

00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:38.958
Caption: we have an iphone app let&#39;s start adding

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.039
Caption: some carplay functionality

00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:44.000
Caption: carplay will be written in swift using

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.000
Caption: the carplay api

00:08:47.518 --> 00:08:51.200
Caption: to build our carplay app we must first

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.720
Caption: specify an entitlement in order to use

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.480
Caption: carplay

00:08:52.719 --> 00:08:57.679
Caption: create a carplay scene to manage the

00:08:54.479 --> 00:09:00.000
Caption: lifecycle of our carplay ui

00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:02.239
Caption: configure to configure our app to use

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.398
Caption: two scenes one for carplay and one for

00:09:02.239 --> 00:09:06.000
Caption: the iphone and finally construct some

00:09:04.398 --> 00:09:09.398
Caption: templates which will be displayed on the

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.398
Caption: carplay screen

00:09:10.239 --> 00:09:14.000
Caption: in order to use carplay you need an

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:16.719
Caption: appropriate entitlement

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.719
Caption: each app category supported by carplay

00:09:16.719 --> 00:09:20.398
Caption: has a

00:09:18.719 --> 00:09:22.958
Caption: has an associated entitlement this is

00:09:20.398 --> 00:09:25.760
Caption: because each car play entitled

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:27.440
Caption: this is because each carplay entitlement

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.320
Caption: unlocks different functionality from the

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.320
Caption: carplay api

00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:34.479
Caption: first we must create an entitlements

00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:36.639
Caption: file and specify our parking entitlement

00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:39.278
Caption: like what is shown on the screen

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.838
Caption: in order to deploy to a device or the

00:09:39.278 --> 00:09:41.838
Caption: app store

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.640
Caption: we need

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:46.559
Caption: and

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.600
Caption: we need the same configuration in an

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:51.838
Caption: associated apple developer account

00:09:49.599 --> 00:09:53.679
Caption: common entitlements like camera access

00:09:51.838 --> 00:09:55.919
Caption: can simply be configured

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:59.599
Caption: carplay is a lot more exclusive you must

00:09:55.919 --> 00:09:59.599
Caption: first contact apple and apply

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:03.599
Caption: for the carplay entitlement as part of

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.278
Caption: this application process apple will

00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:07.440
Caption: check your company

00:10:05.278 --> 00:10:08.719
Caption: and the app being developed

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.398
Caption: when we were working on the carplay

00:10:08.719 --> 00:10:12.000
Caption: functionality for the wilson parking app

00:10:10.398 --> 00:10:14.000
Caption: we had to get wilson to apply for the

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.760
Caption: parking entitlement

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.518
Caption: apple could see that wilson is a parking

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.078
Caption: company they have a parking app and we

00:10:17.518 --> 00:10:22.958
Caption: eventually got the parking entitlement

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:24.078
Caption: if your application is is successful you

00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.359
Caption: can then

00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:27.919
Caption: configure the entitlement through your

00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:29.679
Caption: apple developer account

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:32.479
Caption: our project does not have an associated

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:34.958
Caption: apple developer account

00:10:32.479 --> 00:10:38.559
Caption: so it will not be able to so it can only

00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.559
Caption: run in the simulator environment

00:10:39.838 --> 00:10:44.479
Caption: our carplay scene delegate manages the

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:47.679
Caption: lifecycle of the carplay ui all this

00:10:44.479 --> 00:10:50.559
Caption: does is create our first template and

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:50.559
Caption: set it as through

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:57.440
Caption: our app delegate needs to change so that

00:10:55.278 --> 00:10:59.359
Caption: when carplay connects we return the car

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:03.599
Caption: placing configuration otherwise we

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:03.599
Caption: return the iphone&#39;s same configuration

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:08.479
Caption: let&#39;s now have a look at making our

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.079
Caption: first screen

00:11:08.479 --> 00:11:11.838
Caption: our first screen is going to show us car

00:11:10.078 --> 00:11:14.559
Caption: parks nearby for the purpose of this

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:17.200
Caption: demo i have three markers on the map

00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:19.760
Caption: which are three random locations sorry

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.720
Caption: can i start that bit um

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.720
Caption: i&#39;ll take that forward

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.119
Caption: let&#39;s first let&#39;s have a look at making

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:31.599
Caption: our first screen our first screen is

00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:33.760
Caption: going to show us carpark

00:11:31.599 --> 00:11:36.398
Caption: our first screen is going to show us car

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.160
Caption: parks nearby

00:11:36.398 --> 00:11:39.838
Caption: for the purpose of this demo i have

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:41.440
Caption: chosen three random locations around

00:11:39.838 --> 00:11:42.958
Caption: perth which you can see via the yellow

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.398
Caption: markers

00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.398
Caption: to achieve this we are going to use the

00:11:44.398 --> 00:11:48.320
Caption: point of interest template which has two

00:11:46.398 --> 00:11:50.078
Caption: modes one mode shows us a list of point

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.600
Caption: of interest objects and another mode

00:11:50.078 --> 00:11:55.159
Caption: shows us different data when a point of

00:11:51.599 --> 00:11:55.159
Caption: interest has been selected

00:11:57.919 --> 00:12:00.799
Caption: this code creates our point of interest

00:11:59.599 --> 00:12:04.719
Caption: object

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:07.518
Caption: with three random locations around perth

00:12:04.719 --> 00:12:09.439
Caption: with the aid of a helper method

00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:11.599
Caption: sorry i&#39;ll just done that

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.359
Caption: this code creates our point of interest

00:12:11.599 --> 00:12:14.799
Caption: template

00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:17.278
Caption: with three random

00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:18.799
Caption: carpark locations with the aid of a help

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:20.559
Caption: or function

00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:23.039
Caption: our helper function simply creates a

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:24.638
Caption: point of interest object and returns it

00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:25.518
Caption: this will add a button at the bottom of

00:12:24.638 --> 00:12:27.440
Caption: our

00:12:25.518 --> 00:12:28.638
Caption: point of interest object so that when it

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.559
Caption: is selected in the point of interest

00:12:28.638 --> 00:12:32.638
Caption: template we will see more details which

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:36.679
Caption: will navigate us to the next

00:12:32.638 --> 00:12:36.679
Caption: to the next screen

00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:42.000
Caption: our next screen is going to show us more

00:12:39.838 --> 00:12:43.440
Caption: specific information about a selected

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.880
Caption: car park

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.880
Caption: to achieve this we&#39;re going to use the

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.799
Caption: information template which is a couple

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.559
Caption: of items in the center of the screen and

00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:53.838
Caption: a button at the bottom which takes us

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:53.838
Caption: back to the previous screen

00:12:56.398 --> 00:12:59.518
Caption: this code creates our point of in our

00:12:58.638 --> 00:13:01.119
Caption: sorry

00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:03.359
Caption: this code creates our information

00:13:01.119 --> 00:13:05.119
Caption: template

00:13:03.359 --> 00:13:07.119
Caption: with our list of items displayed in the

00:13:05.119 --> 00:13:09.359
Caption: center and our done button which takes

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:12.719
Caption: us back to the previous screen

00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:12.719
Caption: let&#39;s now see this code running

00:13:15.518 --> 00:13:18.880
Caption: on our iphone simulator we have the

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.958
Caption: carplay demo

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.359
Caption: app this doesn&#39;t have an icon because

00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:25.919
Caption: i&#39;ve just not set one up

00:13:23.359 --> 00:13:29.518
Caption: when we press this we get our iphone ui

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:29.518
Caption: which will display hello world

00:13:30.479 --> 00:13:34.398
Caption: on our carplay simulator when we press

00:13:32.719 --> 00:13:36.479
Caption: our carplay demo app

00:13:34.398 --> 00:13:38.000
Caption: we&#39;ll get our carplay ui

00:13:36.479 --> 00:13:39.838
Caption: which displays our

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.320
Caption: screen containing car parks nearby you

00:13:39.838 --> 00:13:44.078
Caption: can see the three markers

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.160
Caption: our list on the left containing three

00:13:44.078 --> 00:13:48.000
Caption: car parks

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:51.359
Caption: we can select a car park showing us

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.119
Caption: different information about the car park

00:13:51.359 --> 00:13:54.880
Caption: we can select more details which will

00:13:53.119 --> 00:13:56.638
Caption: take us to the next screen showing us in

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.799
Caption: more information about the selected car

00:13:56.638 --> 00:14:00.719
Caption: park

00:13:58.799 --> 00:14:04.479
Caption: we can then press our done button which

00:14:00.719 --> 00:14:04.479
Caption: takes us back to the previous screen

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.398
Caption: not everything can be tested in the

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.160
Caption: simulator environment

00:14:14.398 --> 00:14:18.078
Caption: carplay functionality can differ on

00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:20.078
Caption: actual car to play devices for example

00:14:18.078 --> 00:14:22.320
Caption: in the demo you just saw

00:14:20.078 --> 00:14:25.119
Caption: the information template shows the data

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.119
Caption: area on the left

00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:29.440
Caption: and then it&#39;s um

00:14:28.078 --> 00:14:31.518
Caption: on the screen we have a photo of the

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.278
Caption: wilson parking app which is also using

00:14:31.518 --> 00:14:36.638
Caption: the information template which shows the

00:14:33.278 --> 00:14:36.638
Caption: data area on the right

00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:41.599
Caption: this is because

00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:45.719
Caption: the photo is showing and showing an

00:14:41.599 --> 00:14:45.719

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:51.440
Caption: functionality for the wilson parking app

00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:55.039
Caption: we had to test on

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.958
Caption: cars which supported carplay as well as

00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:59.838
Caption: the carplay device which you can see on

00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:01.119
Caption: the slide

00:14:59.838 --> 00:15:03.039
Caption: if you would like to play further with

00:15:01.119 --> 00:15:05.198
Caption: the demo you just saw you can download

00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:06.799
Caption: it from my github

00:15:05.198 --> 00:15:08.479
Caption: the carplay app programming guide

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:10.559
Caption: documents all the information you need

00:15:08.479 --> 00:15:12.000
Caption: to build a carplay app

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:13.599
Caption: if you would like more information on

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.599
Caption: carplay development i&#39;ve written a blog

00:15:13.599 --> 00:15:16.880
Caption: post which is available here and finally

00:15:15.599 --> 00:15:18.000
