  "description": "The role of a technology leader has never been more challenging. We are in the midst of unprecedented technological change and yet keeping abreast of such advances alone will not guarantee success. Faced with such myriad options how can we be sure that we are guiding our organisation on the path towards future success?\\n\\nIn this talk, we will take an in-depth look at what it takes to create an adaptive technology strategy including metrics, team topologies and evolutionary architecture practices.  We\u0027ll explore how to build feedback loops into your organisation\u2019s technology decisions and ensure that its architecture is an accelerator rather than an inhibitor of business agility:\\n\\n* How to identify and measure key business-aligned metrics and use these data points to pivot your technology strategy.\\n* How to enable effective distributed technology decisions across your organisation\\n* How to build organisational memory surrounding technology decisions that can act as inputs into new decisions.\\n\\nBy the end of the session, you will not only understand what is involved in creating a data-informed technology strategy but also have the knowledge to put it into practice. If you want to take to your expertise in crafting effective technology strategies to the next level, then this is the session for you.
