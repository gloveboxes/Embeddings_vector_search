Caption: software industry for over a decade now

00:01:14.158 --> 00:01:19.769
Caption: and burnout is something that I&#39;ve seen

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:21.059
Caption: specific to our industry all too often

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:23.099
Caption: it&#39;s actually one of the highest

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:25.019
Caption: industries beside to have besides health

Caption: the causes that way you can recognize

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:40.349
Caption: these perhaps call it out as well why

00:01:37.589 --> 00:01:42.658
Caption: it&#39;s so common in our industry this is

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:45.089
Caption: when I touch on agile but it&#39;s not an

00:01:42.658 --> 00:01:45.750
Caption: agile talk so I would be offended if you

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:49.109
Caption: thought otherwise

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.000

Caption: experiences with you one of which is you

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:29.518
Caption: know a lot of my friends in the room

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.128
Caption: will know that I&#39;m not a very vulnerable

00:02:29.518 --> 00:02:33.449
Caption: person I&#39;m not very open to how I&#39;m

00:02:32.128 --> 00:02:35.069
Caption: feeling and that&#39;s what I want to change

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.529
Caption: today I want to help remove this stigma

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.869
Caption: I will be sharing one of my stories but

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:42.179
Caption: I do need your help as well to remove

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:43.828
Caption: some of this stigma so if you&#39;re

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:45.809
Caption: comfortable I&#39;d love if everyone in the

00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:48.509
Caption: room if you&#39;ve experienced burnout if

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:52.738
Caption: you could put your hand up for me oh my

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:54.779
Caption: goodness okay and if anyone in the room

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:59.639
Caption: has has known someone that&#39;s experienced

00:02:54.779 --> 00:03:01.858
Caption: burnout so this has become a huge

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.179
Caption: problem and as we can see you know I

00:03:01.858 --> 00:03:04.229
Caption: would say about eighty-five to ninety

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:06.328
Caption: percent of the room put their hands up

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:08.940
Caption: and it&#39;s become a huge problem when we

00:03:06.328 --> 00:03:12.690
Caption: do need to talk about it more in fact

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:16.319
Caption: two-thirds of the global workforce have

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.000
Caption: experienced burnout in some way there

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.009
Caption: was a survey of thousands of employees

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.598
Caption: across the world and 23 percent of them

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:22.048
Caption: responded that they&#39;ve experienced

00:03:21.598 --> 00:03:25.380
Caption: burnout

00:03:22.048 --> 00:03:26.578
Caption: often if not always another 44 percent

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.620
Caption: responded that they experienced it

00:03:26.578 --> 00:03:31.470
Caption: sometimes with people saying that it&#39;s

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:35.608
Caption: just now part of the job which makes me

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.578
Caption: personally quite sad so what is it let&#39;s

00:03:35.608 --> 00:03:40.259
Caption: investigate that it&#39;s a state of

00:03:38.578 --> 00:03:43.138
Caption: complete emotional and physical

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:46.858
Caption: exhaustion it&#39;s when you have no more to

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:48.450
Caption: give and it has detrimental impacts on

00:03:46.858 --> 00:03:52.738
Caption: our health and I&#39;ll go through some of

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:55.289
Caption: these as well I think of it as a pace

00:03:52.738 --> 00:03:58.138
Caption: that&#39;s simply not sustainable you can&#39;t

00:03:55.289 --> 00:04:00.598
Caption: do it any longer we can think of it as

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.489
Caption: the bank account analogy it&#39;s a state in

00:04:00.598 --> 00:04:05.279
Caption: which the withdrawals are consistently

00:04:02.488 --> 00:04:07.138
Caption: greater than the deposits so much my

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:09.779
Caption: bank account these days but it&#39;s

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.609
Caption: definitely essentially there&#39;s nothing

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:16.859
Caption: else there that you can take no more

00:04:11.608 --> 00:04:18.000
Caption: deposits to take this brings me if you

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.869
Caption: walk away with nothing more than this

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.279
Caption: today I&#39;ll be happy a lot of the

00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:24.479
Caption: research particularly when I was

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:24.929
Caption: starting to delve into this a little bit

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.690
Caption: more as

00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:30.000
Caption: well number of years ago focus is on

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.860
Caption: work-related burnout doesn&#39;t really

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.500
Caption: focus on anything outside of that but if

00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:36.149
Caption: you think about students who are

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.250
Caption: overloaded with study commitments

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:39.929
Caption: they&#39;ve experienced burnout think about

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.359
Caption: primary caregivers with a perhaps

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:44.639
Caption: severely disabled child for example they

00:04:42.359 --> 00:04:47.909
Caption: experienced burnout and it brings me to

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.889
Caption: my story of my first experience it was

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.289
Caption: about nine months ago now and this is my

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.880
Caption: husband and daughter up here look at

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:59.639
Caption: that and for me it was an experience

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.059
Caption: that was completely unrelated to work so

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.260
Caption: I had started at ratify after maternity

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:06.229
Caption: leave so it&#39;s three months into the job

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.000
Caption: and it was amazing there was no

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.100
Caption: unrealistic pressures it was a great

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.309
Caption: environment but I was doing at the same

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:18.029
Caption: time finishing my master&#39;s of HR I had a

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:19.139
Caption: one-year-old severely sleep-deprived if

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:22.919
Caption: any parents in the room would kind of

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:25.199
Caption: relate to that and I was also a sudden

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.848
Caption: part-time job so three days a week and

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.380
Caption: what I was doing was had this

00:05:26.848 --> 00:05:30.869
Caption: preconception that part-time was just

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.580
Caption: five days crammed into three which it&#39;s

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:35.209
Caption: not that&#39;s another thing you should take

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:37.500
Caption: away from today three days is three days

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:40.199
Caption: but what I did is I put the pressures on

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.449
Caption: myself my personality type as well which

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.610
Caption: is one of the leading causes of burnout

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.348
Caption: and I&#39;ll actually go into that was a

00:05:44.609 --> 00:05:49.228
Caption: factor in this and it was the

00:05:46.348 --> 00:05:51.479
Caption: expectations I put myself I started to

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.820
Caption: experience some symptoms which I will be

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.959
Caption: covering but I became disengaged for my

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:00.240
Caption: friends started to get frequent colds

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:03.388
Caption: started to get aches quite often I just

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:04.799
Caption: assumes you know winter colds and it

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.800
Caption: wasn&#39;t until I ended up in hospital with

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:10.759
Caption: heart palpitations from stress that I

00:06:07.799 --> 00:06:14.069
Caption: realized it was stress induced s--

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.750
Caption: burnout so for me it was actually a

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.330
Caption: little bit frustrating because this is a

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.709
Caption: topic that I talk to people about all

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:21.869
Caption: the time and you know know the scientist

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:24.359
Caption: know the symptoms and I completely

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:27.750
Caption: ignored them so I had to investigate why

00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:30.598
Caption: and it was because I associated it to

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.660
Caption: work my work was great so when I saw

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:33.700
Caption: these signs

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.269
Caption: I certainly saw them but I ignored them

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.400
Caption: because my work life was great it was at

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:42.579
Caption: home and my choices that I made that

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:48.489
Caption: made me experience that burnout but

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:51.159
Caption: let&#39;s investigate work what is it about

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:56.259
Caption: our industry that causes such a shocking

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:59.739
Caption: statistic 57 point 1610 there&#39;s a global

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:02.290
Caption: survey across a number of tech companies

00:06:59.739 --> 00:07:04.660
Caption: think Google think you know big small

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.649
Caption: tech companies globally and there was

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.220
Caption: one simple question

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:12.429
Caption: have you experienced burnout and the

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.640
Caption: response yes for 57 point 16 percent of

00:07:12.429 --> 00:07:19.989
Caption: people it was huge

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:21.940
Caption: so let&#39;s investigate why broken it down

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:23.289
Caption: into three causes these are three main

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.600
Caption: causes there&#39;s a lot of information on

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.360
Caption: burnout online that will say some other

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.010
Caption: courses as well but I&#39;ve done three

00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:34.719
Caption: work-related personality and lifestyle

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:37.600
Caption: so a lot of these you might not have

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.040
Caption: control over for example reward and

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.570
Caption: recognition or unclear job expectations

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.309
Caption: you might not be able to control those

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:45.250
Caption: so I wanted to provide you with some

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:47.700
Caption: ways that you or your teams could

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:50.140
Caption: control this now these bottom two and

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.419
Caption: realistic job expectations and high

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.750
Caption: pressure environments are two things

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:58.510
Caption: that I&#39;ve seen in our industry all too

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.980
Caption: often I&#39;d love to see a show of hands if

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:05.800
Caption: you&#39;ve seen these two things in your

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:08.050
Caption: environments yeah so it brings me it&#39;s

00:08:05.799 --> 00:08:10.720
Caption: not a / thing I someone pointed that out

00:08:08.049 --> 00:08:12.129
Caption: these undivided it&#39;s just a line that I

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.320
Caption: put in

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:17.700
Caption: for aesthetic purposes someone was like

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.700
Caption: why are you dividing those two I&#39;m not

00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:25.269
Caption: this brings me to the story of my title

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:28.450
Caption: so I was finishing my masters and I

00:08:25.269 --> 00:08:31.329
Caption: decided to do an assignment on agile

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:34.090
Caption: because I work in an industry where it&#39;s

00:08:31.329 --> 00:08:35.409
Caption: used regularly and I love I just like to

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.110
Caption: know everything about everything so I

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:40.179
Caption: thought that&#39;s just two birds right so I

00:08:38.109 --> 00:08:41.649
Caption: studied the agile manifesto as part of

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.419
Caption: this assignment and realized one of the

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:47.170
Caption: core principles was working at a

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:49.570
Caption: sustainable pace now hands up if you&#39;ve

00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:51.339
Caption: experienced working at an unsigned at

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.309
Caption: this unsustainable pace on an agile

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.450
Caption: project

00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:57.659
Caption: I&#39;m glad most of the room put their

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:02.440
Caption: hands up otherwise I would just walk out

00:08:57.659 --> 00:09:05.919
Caption: so I knew that stat of 57.69 before

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:09.419
Caption: reading this so it got me thinking agile

00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:11.619
Caption: so prevalent in industries is the cause

00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:15.130
Caption: so what I did is I decided to speak to

00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:18.489
Caption: an expert as you should do I went to a

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:20.020
Caption: adult expert within industry and in

00:09:18.489 --> 00:09:22.570
Caption: hindsight probably shouldn&#39;t have opened

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:29.050
Caption: with this question but I just asked her

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:30.220
Caption: flat out does agile calls burnout so in

00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:31.599
Caption: hindsight I should have you know

00:09:30.219 --> 00:09:34.719
Caption: softened that one a little bit but

00:09:31.599 --> 00:09:38.109
Caption: luckily she&#39;s a friend and her response

00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:40.359
Caption: was agile should do the opposite it

00:09:38.109 --> 00:09:44.260
Caption: should an agile culture should do the

00:09:40.359 --> 00:09:47.279
Caption: opposite but as an industry are we truly

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:47.280
Caption: working agile

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.309
Caption: so I had this conversation with him it

00:09:53.539 --> 00:09:56.929
Caption: was it was great we had a lot of

00:09:55.309 --> 00:10:01.849
Caption: discussions out of it after I completely

00:09:56.929 --> 00:10:03.648
Caption: offended her profession initially and we

00:10:01.849 --> 00:10:05.500
Caption: kind of got through the why so you know

00:10:03.648 --> 00:10:08.059
Caption: with clients wanting fix prices and

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.159
Caption: having on these unrealistic expectations

00:10:08.059 --> 00:10:13.179
Caption: and timeframes you know can we the way

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:16.940
Caption: we want to work a jille can we do it I

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:20.419
Caption: think so but I think but we do have to

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.859
Caption: have some solutions in order to make us

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:25.639
Caption: work at a sustainable pace in our

00:10:21.859 --> 00:10:31.088
Caption: industry some simple solutions

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:33.290
Caption: first of all push back you and your team

00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:38.299
Caption: if you&#39;ve got the confidence to do so

00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:41.000
Caption: push back and say questioner does this

00:10:38.299 --> 00:10:42.648
Caption: project or whatever you&#39;re doing don&#39;t

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.679
Caption: will this lead to a sustainable pace

00:10:42.648 --> 00:10:47.750
Caption: it&#39;s a simple question refer back to the

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:50.330
Caption: agile principles and say is is this

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.380
Caption: really agile and questioner question

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.200
Caption: your stakeholders and question your

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.880
Caption: clients it&#39;s easy for me to say but if

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.619
Caption: you truly question it as a group and if

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:02.778
Caption: we do it as an industry we might be able

00:10:57.619 --> 00:11:04.578
Caption: to stop this educate educate our clients

00:11:02.778 --> 00:11:08.809
Caption: and stakeholders as to the benefits of

00:11:04.578 --> 00:11:12.380
Caption: that job or give them information on the

00:11:08.809 --> 00:11:13.789
Caption: effects and costs of burnout personally

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.398
Caption: I think the biggest cost of burner is

00:11:13.789 --> 00:11:17.869
Caption: the human impact personally that I think

00:11:16.398 --> 00:11:18.890
Caption: that&#39;s the biggest one but if you&#39;re

00:11:17.869 --> 00:11:20.179
Caption: talking to clients and stakeholders

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.670
Caption: sometimes you need to work with

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:24.140
Caption: financials so if you tell them and I&#39;ve

00:11:22.669 --> 00:11:27.469
Caption: got links to this as well so you can

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:30.170
Caption: just send them these links it costs test

00:11:27.469 --> 00:11:33.500
Caption: rally ax 10 billion dollars a year

00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:36.559
Caption: that&#39;s what burnout costs Australian

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.539
Caption: companies give them these figures as

00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:39.950
Caption: I&#39;ve got about three or four articles

00:11:38.539 --> 00:11:41.929
Caption: that provide different kind of costs and

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.850
Caption: stats again I think the biggest one is

00:11:41.929 --> 00:11:45.289
Caption: an assuming impact but if we have to

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:47.539
Caption: provide them with this information to

00:11:45.289 --> 00:11:49.869
Caption: educate them more and that&#39;s what we

00:11:47.539 --> 00:11:49.869
Caption: need to do

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:58.380
Caption: now let&#39;s look at personality

00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:00.970
Caption: I personally relate to the top to show

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.650
Caption: of hands if we&#39;ve got some

00:12:00.969 --> 00:12:05.759
Caption: perfectionists and high achieving

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:08.380
Caption: personalities in the room a couple yep

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.419
Caption: now this is one of my favorite things

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:13.059
Caption: about working with some of the people I

00:12:10.419 --> 00:12:15.219
Caption: work with is that they strive for the

00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:18.340
Caption: best and they&#39;re incredibly high

00:12:15.219 --> 00:12:24.789
Caption: achievers but it&#39;s to our detriment as

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:27.040
Caption: well what we need to do here is question

00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:29.529
Caption: whether or not what we&#39;re doing

00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:33.009
Caption: needs to be as perfect as it needs to be

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:36.160
Caption: avoid go gold plating for example just

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:38.080
Caption: question is this worth the stress I know

00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:39.339
Caption: myself that I can sit here and say you

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.570
Caption: know questioner I still do it

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:45.490
Caption: I still go too far and the perfectionism

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:47.619
Caption: spectrum and say yeah I want to do it

00:12:45.489 --> 00:12:53.500
Caption: like this but that leads to stress and

00:12:47.619 --> 00:12:54.010
Caption: myself lifestyle causes poor work-life

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.330
Caption: balance

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.940
Caption: I&#39;ve actually got a prevention the slide

00:12:55.330 --> 00:13:00.429
Caption: for this as well later on too many

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:04.419
Caption: responsibilities but a huge one is not

00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:07.390
Caption: prioritizing sleep remember the bank

00:13:04.419 --> 00:13:08.889
Caption: account analogy so burnout is a state

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.559
Caption: with which the withdrawals are

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:14.350
Caption: consistently greater than the deposits

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:16.210
Caption: the deposits come from sleep the more

00:13:14.349 --> 00:13:19.169
Caption: sleep you get the more deposits you get

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:23.920
Caption: the less you see where I&#39;m going right

00:13:19.169 --> 00:13:25.599
Caption: anyone&#39;s had sleep deprivation before to

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:30.429
Caption: the point where you know you start to

00:13:25.599 --> 00:13:31.389
Caption: feel some physical signs that won&#39;t

00:13:30.429 --> 00:13:36.520
Caption: distract me I love that

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:41.350
Caption: that&#39;ll help not prioritizing sleep is a

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:44.590
Caption: huge one for burnout now we&#39;ve covered

00:13:41.349 --> 00:13:46.089
Caption: some of the main causes let&#39;s look at

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.650
Caption: some of the signs and symptoms and as I

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.420
Caption: said there&#39;s no cause without that and I

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:51.730
Caption: provided those in articles because I

00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:53.799
Caption: have 20 minutes some of those signs and

00:13:51.729 --> 00:13:55.089
Caption: symptoms I&#39;ve broken it up into my

00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:59.380
Caption: animations a bit all over the shop but I

00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:02.600
Caption: had fun emotional behavioral and

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:04.609
Caption: physical emotional

00:14:02.599 --> 00:14:06.440
Caption: in my opinion is just when you&#39;re you&#39;re

00:14:04.609 --> 00:14:08.898
Caption: not feeling yourself you&#39;ll know this

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.609
Caption: within yourself if you start to feel

00:14:08.898 --> 00:14:14.809
Caption: lack of motivation and what you&#39;re doing

00:14:10.609 --> 00:14:16.429
Caption: or your productivity levels lower or if

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:18.799
Caption: you become if you&#39;re usually quite an

00:14:16.429 --> 00:14:20.778
Caption: optimistic person and you start to see

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:23.028
Caption: yourself become a little bit pessimist

00:14:20.778 --> 00:14:24.318
Caption: in the way you view things then this is

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:27.500
Caption: when you should simply pick up the phone

00:14:24.318 --> 00:14:29.599
Caption: and speak to your EAP Employee

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:33.198
Caption: Assistance Program hopefully you&#39;ve got

00:14:29.599 --> 00:14:35.299
Caption: that at work or your GP or a friend

00:14:33.198 --> 00:14:38.859
Caption: these are kind of some early indicators

00:14:35.299 --> 00:14:42.229
Caption: for you to start picking up that phone

00:14:38.859 --> 00:14:44.659
Caption: behavioral I think that you see these

00:14:42.229 --> 00:14:46.039
Caption: more often in others before you

00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:48.078
Caption: recognize them in yourself and that&#39;s

00:14:46.039 --> 00:14:49.250
Caption: just me but if you know people quite

00:14:48.078 --> 00:14:51.018
Caption: well and you see that they start to

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:53.599
Caption: become disengaged or they&#39;re not

00:14:51.018 --> 00:14:54.198
Caption: training up to work or they&#39;re isolating

00:14:53.599 --> 00:14:56.208
Caption: themselves

00:14:54.198 --> 00:14:58.778
Caption: I find this easier to recognize in

00:14:56.208 --> 00:15:01.638
Caption: others before I see you to myself and

00:14:58.778 --> 00:15:03.588
Caption: this is as simple as asking them you

00:15:01.638 --> 00:15:05.119
Caption: know I&#39;ve noticed this are you okay do

00:15:03.588 --> 00:15:06.679
Caption: you want to talk about it equip them

00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:08.929
Caption: with the resources that I provide at the

00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:11.148
Caption: end of the slide tell them that there&#39;s

00:15:08.929 --> 00:15:13.369
Caption: an EAP or simply be that listening ear

00:15:11.148 --> 00:15:15.619
Caption: as well but these are some really key

00:15:13.369 --> 00:15:17.688
Caption: indicators when someone might be it&#39;s

00:15:15.619 --> 00:15:20.239
Caption: other things as well and there&#39;s other

00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:23.870
Caption: things that can be a result of this but

00:15:20.239 --> 00:15:25.609
Caption: burnout have these symptoms now a lot of

00:15:23.869 --> 00:15:28.008
Caption: people don&#39;t really associate burnout to

00:15:25.609 --> 00:15:29.989
Caption: physical science but if you notice the

00:15:28.008 --> 00:15:32.179
Caption: last two are the ones that I experienced

00:15:29.989 --> 00:15:35.568
Caption: obviously I had the other ones first but

00:15:32.179 --> 00:15:37.969
Caption: these are two that I experienced a lot

00:15:35.568 --> 00:15:40.669
Caption: of the research shows as well because

00:15:37.969 --> 00:15:42.169
Caption: burnout is a lot of stress right there&#39;s

00:15:40.669 --> 00:15:44.328
Caption: a a lot of stress hormones that are

00:15:42.169 --> 00:15:44.809
Caption: released that actually alters our brain

00:15:44.328 --> 00:15:47.479
Caption: anatomy

00:15:44.809 --> 00:15:50.439
Caption: if we go into it for too long so there&#39;s

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:54.068
Caption: a lot of physical signs and symptoms and

00:15:50.439 --> 00:15:56.089
Caption: reasons that we want to avoid burnout

00:15:54.068 --> 00:15:57.469
Caption: these are also symptoms for many other

00:15:56.088 --> 00:16:01.250
Caption: things so I think in general if you

00:15:57.469 --> 00:16:04.159
Caption: experience these you call someone call

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:05.299
Caption: your GP that would probably be a first

00:16:04.159 --> 00:16:06.799
Caption: point of call for a lot of these mine

00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:09.799
Caption: was the hospital I skipped the GP all

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:12.438
Caption: together now some of these are pretty

00:16:09.799 --> 00:16:14.208
Caption: heavy so let&#39;s look at how we prevent it

00:16:12.439 --> 00:16:14.820
Caption: because none of us want to experience

00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:18.329
Caption: these

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:19.890
Caption: these signs and symptoms are up here so

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.630
Caption: as individuals I think that we can

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.130
Caption: prevent burnout by understanding these

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.169
Caption: signs and symptoms so you can start to

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.489
Caption: see them in yourself I&#39;m standing the

00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:28.769
Caption: causes so you can either avoid them

00:16:26.489 --> 00:16:31.440
Caption: altogether or you can alter them change

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:33.300
Caption: the environment around you but how do we

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.530
Caption: prevent it as an industry I think it&#39;s a

00:16:33.299 --> 00:16:35.580
Caption: little bit broader than that as well I

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.460
Caption: think we have to work together to

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:40.920
Caption: prevent it and I also want to see that

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.510
Caption: stat lowered next time they do a decided

00:16:40.919 --> 00:16:45.869
Caption: to do a global survey X I&#39;m sure that&#39;s

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:47.790
Caption: easy but as organizations as well I

00:16:45.869 --> 00:16:50.279
Caption: think need to take this too into account

00:16:47.789 --> 00:16:52.139
Caption: we as as people and individuals can only

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.580
Caption: do so much organizations also know to

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.580
Caption: take some of these things on board I

00:16:56.299 --> 00:17:01.890
Caption: spelt this word wrong so many times and

00:16:59.419 --> 00:17:04.380
Caption: I was practicing this last night and

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:06.328
Caption: thankfully the people who are practicing

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.859
Caption: it too we&#39;re just they didn&#39;t even know

00:17:06.328 --> 00:17:13.799
Caption: what I was trying to say but that word

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:15.179
Caption: is psychological safety it&#39;s a word you

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.380
Caption: would have seen around a lot lately and

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.459
Caption: I&#39;m not gonna go too much into it

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.440
Caption: because there&#39;s separate talks on this

00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:22.559
Caption: as well but there&#39;s a really cool

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:23.729
Caption: project Google did project Aristotle and

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.260
Caption: they were trying to investigate what

00:17:23.729 --> 00:17:27.750
Caption: makes successful teens and this was

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.099
Caption: number one for them essentially what it

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:32.459
Caption: is is being able to show your true self

00:17:29.099 --> 00:17:34.619
Caption: without fear of consequence coming to

00:17:32.459 --> 00:17:37.459
Caption: work being yourself without feeling like

00:17:34.619 --> 00:17:44.579
Caption: you&#39;re going to get in trouble for that

00:17:37.459 --> 00:17:47.069
Caption: without this oops yeah okay worked out

00:17:44.579 --> 00:17:49.880
Caption: the clicker without this people won&#39;t

00:17:47.069 --> 00:17:53.069
Caption: call out if they&#39;re feeling burnt out

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:55.199
Caption: if you don&#39;t sorry if you don&#39;t have

00:17:53.069 --> 00:17:57.269
Caption: this what it will do will instigate a

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:58.829
Caption: fight or flight response so it&#39;s a

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:02.160
Caption: physiological response where your brain

00:17:58.829 --> 00:18:03.299
Caption: just releases Hebrew chemicals and you I

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.310
Caption: don&#39;t know if any of you been into fight

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.360
Caption: or flight but I just I forget my name I

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.700
Caption: get really tense

00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:12.299
Caption: I forget what I do it&#39;s not a good thing

00:18:08.699 --> 00:18:15.719
Caption: to be in and also prolong states these

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.830
Caption: stress hormones has huge effects on your

00:18:15.719 --> 00:18:18.839
Caption: body you would have seen some of those

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:22.709
Caption: physical science prolonged states of

00:18:18.839 --> 00:18:23.880
Caption: fight or flight is not good for you so

00:18:22.709 --> 00:18:26.369
Caption: what can we do about psychological

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.260
Caption: safety and again this is a huge topic so

00:18:26.369 --> 00:18:29.910
Caption: I think I&#39;ve got about five articles

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:33.570
Caption: the URL where you can just read about it

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:35.640
Caption: as well you can listen and when I say

00:18:33.569 --> 00:18:36.989
Caption: that I mean really actively listen you

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.760
Caption: know show you&#39;re engaged put your stuff

00:18:36.989 --> 00:18:41.280
Caption: away I think you know in our world

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.540
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of holding devices while

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.950
Caption: you&#39;re in a conversation I think that

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:47.700
Caption: you know takes the human element out of

00:18:43.949 --> 00:18:49.319
Caption: it so really listen show empathy don&#39;t

00:18:47.699 --> 00:18:51.599
Caption: use discouraging language like you&#39;ll be

00:18:49.319 --> 00:18:53.779
Caption: right that&#39;s the obvious thing you&#39;ll be

00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:56.549
Caption: right mate or you know it&#39;s very much

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:58.440
Caption: you know dismissive of their feelings so

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:01.920
Caption: try and use encouraging words and also

00:18:58.439 --> 00:19:03.869
Caption: try and relate by being real don&#39;t

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.390
Caption: respond to how you think you need to

00:19:03.869 --> 00:19:07.739
Caption: respond there&#39;s no script for this in

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.880
Caption: fact there is online and I didn&#39;t

00:19:07.739 --> 00:19:11.790
Caption: include those for that very reason

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:15.900
Caption: because there&#39;s there&#39;s no script for

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:17.340
Caption: being human and being real and action it

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:22.830
Caption: do something about it if you&#39;re in a

00:19:17.339 --> 00:19:24.119
Caption: position to do so talk about it talk

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:26.130
Caption: about to professionals but also talk

00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:28.380
Caption: about it to each other had a really good

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.640
Caption: friend friend and colleague of mine in a

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.829
Caption: leadership position and he was

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.500
Caption: experiencing burnout some really obvious

00:19:31.829 --> 00:19:38.519
Caption: symptoms and after we identified that I

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:41.910
Caption: told him to contact our aap and there

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.650
Caption: was still this hesitancy to do so and I

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:46.050
Caption: said to him when you&#39;ve recovered when

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:49.589
Caption: you feel better can you please say to

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:51.600
Caption: the team I used our EAP Employee

00:19:49.589 --> 00:19:54.900
Caption: Assistance Program and I experienced

00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:56.459
Caption: burnout and he did and it was incredibly

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.410
Caption: impactful I&#39;ve had people come to me

00:19:56.459 --> 00:20:00.839
Caption: after those sort of conversations and

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:02.010
Caption: say you know what me too so I think if

00:20:00.839 --> 00:20:04.229
Caption: you&#39;re in a leadership position or in

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:08.339
Caption: any sort of position of influence talk

00:20:04.229 --> 00:20:10.410
Caption: about it it&#39;s hugely impactful work-life

00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:12.029
Caption: balance life balance my husband hates

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.130
Caption: the term work-life balance he&#39;s in their

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:16.979
Caption: well-being industry because he believes

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:20.250
Caption: that you know work family friends

00:20:16.979 --> 00:20:23.429
Caption: they&#39;re all part of life right so as

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:25.290
Caption: long as you remember that neither should

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:28.080
Caption: be neglected it should be made a

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:30.300
Caption: priority there&#39;s no such thing as

00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:31.890
Caption: perfect this week I certainly didn&#39;t

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.660

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:36.530
Caption: I did from the dhih dhih dhih talk but I

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:39.359
Caption: didn&#39;t neglect my daughter and husband

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:41.349
Caption: unplug and turn off notifications this

00:20:39.359 --> 00:20:44.160
Caption: is a really good one to do special

00:20:41.349 --> 00:20:47.229
Caption: in our world and show your support for

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.109
Caption: example ratify we wrote a blog to show

00:20:47.229 --> 00:20:53.918
Caption: why and how we support work-life balance

00:20:50.109 --> 00:20:55.209
Caption: within our organization and I&#39;ve already

00:20:53.918 --> 00:20:58.119
Caption: had conversations off the back of this

00:20:55.209 --> 00:20:58.779

Caption: you to know the causes

00:21:02.439 --> 00:21:06.869
Caption: signs and symptoms so you can prevent it

00:21:04.449 --> 00:21:10.089
Caption: and recognize those within yourself I

00:21:06.869 --> 00:21:12.489
Caption: want you to question it will this lead

00:21:10.089 --> 00:21:14.650
Caption: to a sustainable pace it&#39;s a simple

00:21:12.489 --> 00:21:16.808
Caption: question as you asked it you know anyone

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.219
Caption: in your organization or a project lead

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:21.219
Caption: for example it&#39;s a it&#39;s quite an

00:21:18.219 --> 00:21:23.709
Caption: impactful question share your

00:21:21.219 --> 00:21:26.380
Caption: experiences and stories and simply talk

00:21:23.709 --> 00:21:29.739
Caption: about them and remember it&#39;s not just

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.449
Caption: work-related I truly hope that today I

00:21:29.739 --> 00:21:33.729
Caption: in some way removed a little bit of the

00:21:31.449 --> 00:21:35.139
Caption: stigma around the topic I also wanted to

00:21:33.729 --> 00:21:36.880
Caption: provide you with some resources and

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:41.289
Caption: again the slides have a lot more than

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:44.199
Caption: this I experienced burnout and so

00:21:41.288 --> 00:21:45.788
Caption: there&#39;s 57 points 16% of our industry so

00:21:44.199 --> 00:21:47.918
Caption: we need to make this okay to talk about

00:21:45.788 --> 00:21:49.689
Caption: most of you in the room put your hands

00:21:47.918 --> 00:21:50.168
