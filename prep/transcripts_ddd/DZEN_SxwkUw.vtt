Caption: communication and this is kind of my

00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:07.798
Caption: journey because I didn&#39;t draw a few

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.379
Caption: years ago in fact if you look at my

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.560
Caption: drawings a year ago completely different

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:15.779
Caption: to to how I draw now and how I sort of

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:18.419
Caption: run a presentation or a whiteboard and I

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:20.040
Caption: try not to use PowerPoint anymore I try

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:22.500
Caption: to always use a whiteboard when I&#39;m

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.759
Caption: presenting something

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.759
Caption: so first

Caption: Okay so

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.020
Caption: a question

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:43.078
Caption: who in a room

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:44.819
Caption: feels that they&#39;re comfortable drawing

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.520
Caption: hands up

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.739

Caption: um

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.658
Caption: all right I&#39;ve always been very

00:01:56.158 --> 00:02:00.239
Caption: comfortable in front of a whiteboard but

00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:01.798
Caption: my drawing has been pretty crap up until

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.059
Caption: about a year ago

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.299
Caption: so

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:08.339
Caption: um in here you&#39;ll see when I&#39;m moving my

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.500
Caption: fingers so you&#39;ll see little little dots

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:12.179
Caption: okay

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.738
Caption: all right so I&#39;m gonna

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:17.159
Caption: I&#39;m gonna Draw Something

00:02:13.738 --> 00:02:19.639
Caption: on a board on a paper on a flip chart

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.639
Caption: okay

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:28.500
Caption: now I don&#39;t think

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:31.458
Caption: my handwriting is very good but

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.458
Caption: bear with me

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.500
Caption: Okay so

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.458
Caption: something simple

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:48.059
Caption: not very good but what does that look

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.619
Caption: like

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:51.619
Caption: fire yep

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:56.458
Caption: I can shade with other colors but

00:02:54.238 --> 00:02:59.958
Caption: shading kind of helps sometimes

00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:59.958
Caption: right so I&#39;m going to call it number one

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.119
Caption: now that didn&#39;t work very well at all

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.059
Caption: right can I get that back

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.500
Caption: uh yeah there it is

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.300
Caption: okay

00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:23.399
Caption: so we might we might use fire you know

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.720
Caption: when we&#39;re working

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.399
Caption: um something that&#39;s hot or maybe

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.259
Caption: something that&#39;s dangerous as well right

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:30.259
Caption: or something that might need attention

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.799
Caption: foreign

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:51.598
Caption: quite simple a little bit of shading

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.598
Caption: [Music]

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:56.598
Caption: a factory industry a location

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.759
Caption: okay

00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:13.039
Caption: this one&#39;s quite relevant to us here in

00:04:10.018 --> 00:04:13.039
Caption: Western Australia isn&#39;t it

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.739
Caption: right

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.739
Caption: a shark Danger

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.079
Caption: so these symbols are really quick to

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:30.000
Caption: draw so if you&#39;re actually running a

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:32.638
Caption: whiteboard session you can you can add

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.279
Caption: them to Pages as as you need them right

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.899
Caption: people walking in there&#39;s paper pencils

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.940
Caption: at the front if you want to copy and

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:41.899
Caption: please if you want copy this if if you

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.899
Caption: want to copy as I go

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.540
Caption: foreign

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.679
Caption: setting a goal right being able to draw

00:04:56.399 --> 00:05:00.479
Caption: something on you know on a whiteboard to

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:02.959
Caption: say this is our goal and just represent

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.959
Caption: it visually

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:07.919
Caption: a flip chart would have worked better

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:10.940
Caption: but uh

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.940
Caption: this goes all right

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.320
Caption: so perhaps

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.880
Caption: foreign

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:27.259
Caption: we&#39;re on a journey

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:33.899
Caption: right very simple helicopter

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:37.579
Caption: number five

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:37.579
Caption: and the last one I&#39;m going to draw

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:54.600
Caption: all right skull

00:05:54.779 --> 00:06:02.299
Caption: and crossbones

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:02.299
Caption: right again for danger very easy to do

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:07.259
Caption: didn&#39;t take long if they&#39;re quite simple

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:08.519
Caption: basic shapes you put them together

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.119
Caption: but you have to remember them if you&#39;re

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:11.119
Caption: going to draw them

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.899
Caption: so that&#39;s how I do it on a flip chart

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:30.419
Caption: this is how I would present it

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:32.219
Caption: on a light board right

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.220
Caption: that I would have to do this ahead of

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.739
Caption: time I can&#39;t draw quickly

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.660
Caption: however I do pre-draw these and put them

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:41.638
Caption: in a library so that I can just pop them

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.959
Caption: on when I&#39;m when I&#39;m working with a

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.199
Caption: light board

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:45.199
Caption: okay

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:51.660
Caption: so I don&#39;t know if this is true or not

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:53.039
Caption: but when I Googled

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.739
Caption: right

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:58.619
Caption: the fear of whiteboarding

00:06:55.739 --> 00:07:02.039
Caption: I can&#39;t draw you know last time I drew

00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:03.479
Caption: was with a crayon I went on five

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:04.979
Caption: um a lot of people are like this you

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.539
Caption: walk into a room and say can you draw

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:08.220
Caption: this and it&#39;s like no I can&#39;t draw you

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:10.940
Caption: know I can draw sticks stick figures

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.940
Caption: that&#39;s about it

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:18.418
Caption: so this has taken just from Wikipedia

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:19.259
Caption: right

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:22.440
Caption: um

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:26.160
Caption: the use of visual elements to convey

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:30.660
Caption: ideas and information okay using

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:34.559
Caption: fonts science topography drawing

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:36.239
Caption: so why why do we want to do this okay

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:36.959
Caption: so

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:40.079
Caption: um

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:42.059
Caption: one things it it relays message is much

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:44.039
Caption: faster if you can put some imagery in

00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:46.559
Caption: there right I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all heard

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:48.239
Caption: the the saying a picture a picture is

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:51.779
Caption: worth a thousand words

00:07:48.239 --> 00:07:53.519
Caption: it can remove ambiguity

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:56.000
Caption: um you know a comma in a wrong spot

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:58.379
Caption: changes things with the English language

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.539
Caption: if you draw it with a picture a diagram

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:03.479
Caption: or something like that it&#39;s it&#39;s right

00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:05.220
Caption: in front of you and I worked as an

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:08.160
Caption: architect and I still do sort of

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.959
Caption: architecture stuff for a long time go in

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.300
Caption: a room you put the picture up everyone&#39;s

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:14.638
Caption: got it in front of them and you&#39;re

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:16.079
Caption: talking to it and changing it okay as

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:18.179
Caption: opposed to trying to read through and

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:20.539
Caption: understand it you bring it in much much

00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:20.539
Caption: faster

00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:25.799
Caption: okay

00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:28.619
Caption: okay so I&#39;m going to talk a little bit

00:08:25.799 --> 00:08:32.059
Caption: about my journey all right and I&#39;ll do

00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:32.059
Caption: it with with pictures

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.360
Caption: so

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.080
Caption: I don&#39;t know when you&#39;re in school and

00:08:38.158 --> 00:08:41.820
Caption: you&#39;re asked to draw a landscape this is

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.520
Caption: kind of what you drew you know the

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.679
Caption: Horizon some mountains the sun gave it

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.540
Caption: some color

00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:51.179
Caption: so I&#39;m going to start there

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:54.359
Caption: all right and this is my journey

00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:57.419
Caption: so about 10 years ago

00:08:54.359 --> 00:08:59.820
Caption: um I was using physical whiteboards

00:08:57.419 --> 00:09:02.239
Caption: and these are the sort of things I was

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:06.000
Caption: you know putting up on the screen

00:09:02.239 --> 00:09:07.619
Caption: pretty bland but I guess they got the um

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.539
Caption: the message across as to what we&#39;re

00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:14.278
Caption: trying to do

00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:16.380
Caption: okay and about 2012 I I wanted to start

00:09:14.278 --> 00:09:18.898
Caption: taking digital notes and and using a

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.880
Caption: tablet so I bought a stylus optimized

00:09:18.898 --> 00:09:22.679
Caption: tablet

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.838
Caption: 2012 the apple pencil still didn&#39;t exist

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:29.760
Caption: you were told to use a finger

00:09:24.838 --> 00:09:33.838
Caption: and um so I bought an Android tablet and

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:37.140
Caption: um I it never really worked well

00:09:33.838 --> 00:09:39.119
Caption: um but I I persisted I went through

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.040
Caption: about four different Android tablets

00:09:39.119 --> 00:09:42.539
Caption: with styluses

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:44.458
Caption: um but my

00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:46.559
Caption: my drawing on a tablet

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:49.440
Caption: looked worse than it did on a whiteboard

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:52.278
Caption: okay but I was using it

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.278
Caption: then

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:57.119
Caption: this happened

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.278
Caption: okay and everyone stopped going into an

00:09:57.119 --> 00:10:01.580
Caption: office and I I no longer had access to a

00:09:59.278 --> 00:10:01.580
Caption: whiteboard

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:06.419
Caption: um but we had Zoom

00:10:03.838 --> 00:10:10.200
Caption: and all of a sudden a tablet with a pen

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:11.820
Caption: became really really handy I could you

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.119
Caption: know join the zoom meeting with my

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:17.100
Caption: tablet and I could draw kind of like on

00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:19.679
Caption: a whiteboard but I was still pretty crap

00:10:17.099 --> 00:10:21.778
Caption: at drawing okay still really crappy

00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:22.859
Caption: drawing but at least I was able to do

00:10:21.778 --> 00:10:25.260
Caption: something

00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:28.500
Caption: and then early last year I changed jobs

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:31.619
Caption: and I started working for with confluent

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.539
Caption: and as a as an organization for their

00:10:31.619 --> 00:10:35.458
Caption: Solutions Engineers of which I&#39;m a

00:10:33.539 --> 00:10:37.979
Caption: Solutions engineer

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:41.458
Caption: um they had enabled

00:10:37.979 --> 00:10:43.079
Caption: um their Workforce with an iPad with an

00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:44.179
Caption: app called Concepts that I hadn&#39;t used

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.559
Caption: before

00:10:44.179 --> 00:10:47.578
Caption: and some other tools and I&#39;ll go through

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:49.739
Caption: the tools

00:10:47.578 --> 00:10:51.059
Caption: and it was a little bit eye opening I

00:10:49.739 --> 00:10:54.479
Caption: thought wow this is really cool this

00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:55.200
Caption: this actually works so if I show you

00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:58.260
Caption: um

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.260
Caption: I guess what my whiteboards look like

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.880
Caption: within about a month of starting working

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.700
Caption: with those tools

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.278
Caption: at uh at Confluence so definitely

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.958
Caption: improved right I&#39;m starting to to draw

00:11:08.278 --> 00:11:12.000
Caption: things out now one of the nice things

00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.859
Caption: about Concepts and I I&#39;m going to say if

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.299
Caption: you&#39;ve got a an iPad even if you&#39;ve got

00:11:13.859 --> 00:11:17.338
Caption: Android Concepts works on the Android

00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:19.919
Caption: but the documents aren&#39;t compatible

00:11:17.338 --> 00:11:21.919
Caption: between them and there&#39;s it&#39;s sort of a

00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:25.139
Caption: couple of versions behind on Android

00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:27.539
Caption: it&#39;s still okay all right but

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:30.359
Caption: um the infinite canvas so I can scroll

00:11:27.539 --> 00:11:33.059
Caption: left right out in it it&#39;s just good to

00:11:30.359 --> 00:11:34.500
Caption: be able to you know zoom into detail

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:37.500
Caption: like I&#39;m doing here

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:40.500
Caption: okay and in about two months after I

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.838
Caption: joined we had someone you come into

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.760
Caption: leadership and she suggested because we

00:11:42.838 --> 00:11:48.239
Caption: were all using this that we should maybe

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:50.278
Caption: do some training in it and um I attended

00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:53.119
Caption: a two-day workshop

00:11:50.278 --> 00:11:55.619
Caption: um on visual facilitation

00:11:53.119 --> 00:11:57.539
Caption: by a company in Australia called The

00:11:55.619 --> 00:11:59.700
Caption: Humble PM now becablo is a German

00:11:57.539 --> 00:12:02.278
Caption: company they

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:05.220
Caption: um they basically sell material around

00:12:02.278 --> 00:12:06.979
Caption: visual facilitation and

00:12:05.219 --> 00:12:10.619
Caption: um there&#39;s a guy called Mark cundeleby

00:12:06.979 --> 00:12:11.820
Caption: that runs these courses so they&#39;re quite

00:12:10.619 --> 00:12:14.278
Caption: expensive it&#39;s about fifteen hundred

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.979
Caption: dollars if you can get your company to

00:12:14.278 --> 00:12:18.059
Caption: to sponsor you know this it&#39;d be really

00:12:16.979 --> 00:12:19.679
Caption: cool

00:12:18.059 --> 00:12:20.219
Caption: and

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:22.320
Caption: um

00:12:20.219 --> 00:12:24.559
Caption: I&#39;m going to show you these drawings

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.958
Caption: here that I started this this morning

00:12:24.559 --> 00:12:29.099
Caption: that&#39;s using the becablo sort of

00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.260
Caption: technique

00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:36.119
Caption: all right and this this kind of really

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:38.820
Caption: took off for me right so my my drawing

00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:42.239
Caption: just changed and it it

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:44.338
Caption: changed on a sort of a rapid

00:12:42.239 --> 00:12:48.739
Caption: um progression

00:12:44.338 --> 00:12:48.739
Caption: so I will go into the tools

00:12:50.338 --> 00:12:54.359
Caption: so with digital

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.119
Caption: I have an iPad

00:12:54.359 --> 00:12:58.979
Caption: and drawing with a pencil on an iPad if

00:12:57.119 --> 00:13:01.260
Caption: you&#39;ve got one it&#39;s it&#39;s not very good

00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:03.838
Caption: it sort of slips and slides everywhere

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.338
Caption: um Samsung with their Stylus is much

00:13:03.838 --> 00:13:07.500
Caption: much better I much prefer to note take

00:13:05.338 --> 00:13:10.018
Caption: on a Samsung Style on a Samsung tablet

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.719
Caption: and and I use that in meetings so I

00:13:10.018 --> 00:13:15.059
Caption: typically carry a Macbook my iPad and a

00:13:12.719 --> 00:13:18.838
Caption: Samsung tablet so lots of things to keep

00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:21.659
Caption: charged it gets better if you put a

00:13:18.838 --> 00:13:24.179
Caption: screen protector on the glass and you

00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:27.359
Caption: can get this one off of Amazon it&#39;s

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:30.479
Caption: called uh it&#39;s from Belmond it&#39;s about

00:13:27.359 --> 00:13:32.518
Caption: 25 for two screen protectors

00:13:30.479 --> 00:13:34.440
Caption: and it gives it a bit of a matte finish

00:13:32.518 --> 00:13:36.119
Caption: so it feels more like writing on paper

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.720
Caption: they&#39;ve tried to emulate their paper

00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:43.500
Caption: with the pencil so I would recommend it

00:13:39.719 --> 00:13:44.638
Caption: and of course the concepts app this is a

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.799
Caption: really good app

00:13:44.638 --> 00:13:48.239
Caption: and if you have problems their support&#39;s

00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:52.638
Caption: really good it&#39;s only a small team out

00:13:48.239 --> 00:13:52.638
Caption: of California that write this

00:13:55.739 --> 00:14:01.320
Caption: and then lastly

00:13:58.039 --> 00:14:03.000
Caption: you don&#39;t need this and I could show you

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.458
Caption: how this works except my macbook&#39;s at

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.679
Caption: the back of the room so I can&#39;t uh it

00:14:05.458 --> 00:14:11.638
Caption: basically is a airplay receiver running

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:15.299
Caption: on your Macbook so that I can present

00:14:11.638 --> 00:14:17.820
Caption: from my iPad up here or wherever it is

00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:19.138
Caption: onto a screen somewhere with a HDMI

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.419
Caption: cable

00:14:19.138 --> 00:14:23.898
Caption: okay so that&#39;s digital

00:14:21.419 --> 00:14:23.898
Caption: now

00:14:27.179 --> 00:14:30.320
Caption: with paper

00:14:30.859 --> 00:14:35.219
Caption: if you do the vocabulary course and you

00:14:33.179 --> 00:14:38.278
Caption: don&#39;t have to do it but if you do it you

00:14:35.219 --> 00:14:41.578
Caption: get one of these sort of packs and you

00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:43.559
Caption: get these refillable pens from Newland

00:14:41.578 --> 00:14:45.119
Caption: and they have like hundreds of colors

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:46.578
Caption: they have them for paper they have them

00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:49.138
Caption: for whiteboards

00:14:46.578 --> 00:14:50.760
Caption: very large tips for doing shading and

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:53.338
Caption: things so they&#39;re really good if you

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:56.338
Caption: sort of you know if your work is in a

00:14:53.338 --> 00:14:58.380
Caption: room and you are you know doing sort of

00:14:56.338 --> 00:14:59.880
Caption: agile facilitation and you want to draw

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.679
Caption: out a journey or something like that and

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.760
Caption: you&#39;re doing it on paper these are

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:04.619
Caption: really good much better than what you

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.639
Caption: can get from an officeworks

00:15:04.619 --> 00:15:07.619
Caption: okay

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:10.979
Caption: now they&#39;re expensive and you can buy

00:15:07.619 --> 00:15:14.239
Caption: them online also with actually I&#39;ll show

00:15:10.979 --> 00:15:14.239
Caption: that later I&#39;ll leave that for now

00:15:15.719 --> 00:15:20.879
Caption: and again I&#39;ve also I&#39;ve already

00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:24.479
Caption: mentioned this but uh with whiteboards

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.760
Caption: again the Newland markers and I&#39;m going

00:15:24.479 --> 00:15:29.099
Caption: to suggest that if you&#39;re buying markers

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:32.160
Caption: buy the ones that have

00:15:29.099 --> 00:15:33.479
Caption: the sort of rectangular tips

00:15:32.159 --> 00:15:35.539
Caption: you have chisel tip is that what it&#39;s

00:15:33.479 --> 00:15:38.398
Caption: called cool there you go learn something

00:15:35.539 --> 00:15:40.018
Caption: so you can use both edges right so my

00:15:38.398 --> 00:15:43.440
Caption: little people here they&#39;re just sort of

00:15:40.018 --> 00:15:45.719
Caption: emulated it on my tablet is the wide one

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.698
Caption: to draw the bodies and a narrow one to

00:15:45.719 --> 00:15:49.619
Caption: draw the heads and arms

00:15:47.698 --> 00:15:50.940
Caption: so uh

00:15:49.619 --> 00:15:53.760
Caption: all right

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:56.419
Caption: so now this is a follow along

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.419
Caption: how to draw

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.179
Caption: okay

00:15:59.518 --> 00:16:03.719
Caption: so please uh copy me if you want to

00:16:02.698 --> 00:16:07.578
Caption: right

00:16:03.719 --> 00:16:07.578
Caption: lines these are simple

00:16:08.518 --> 00:16:10.880
Caption: right

00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:19.638
Caption: easy

00:16:23.039 --> 00:16:26.119
Caption: getting a bit harder

00:16:27.479 --> 00:16:33.958
Caption: so these Newland Pens have places for

00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:35.698
Caption: your your finger so you&#39;re always

00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.619
Caption: holding it the right way so that tip

00:16:35.698 --> 00:16:39.799
Caption: touches the paper the way it&#39;s supposed

00:16:37.619 --> 00:16:39.799
Caption: to

00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:47.880
Caption: and I&#39;m never good at making circles

00:16:45.719 --> 00:16:49.739
Caption: circles but that&#39;s that one that one

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.338
Caption: turned out pretty good

00:16:49.739 --> 00:16:52.338
Caption: all right

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.698
Caption: squiggly shapes

00:17:02.758 --> 00:17:05.359
Caption: right

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:20.540
Caption: and the last ones

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:20.540
Caption: are the other shapes

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.678
Caption: all right

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.760
Caption: my shark fin

00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:33.900
Caption: and the letter u

00:17:32.699 --> 00:17:35.939
Caption: so

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:39.419
Caption: if you can do all those shapes you can

00:17:35.939 --> 00:17:41.459
Caption: draw all of the vicablo

00:17:39.418 --> 00:17:43.880
Caption: symbols

00:17:41.459 --> 00:17:43.880
Caption: so

00:17:46.199 --> 00:17:48.859
Caption: like that

00:18:03.678 --> 00:18:09.558
Caption: all right very quick to draw something

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.559
Caption: and of course

00:18:16.079 --> 00:18:18.979
Caption: shading helps

00:18:31.678 --> 00:18:37.260
Caption: so here&#39;s some other shapes

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:40.459
Caption: and again you&#39;ll see them all in

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.459
Caption: the vocabulary shapes

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.760
Caption: and again

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:51.140
Caption: coloring shading

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.140
Caption: really changes the way they look

00:18:54.479 --> 00:18:57.500
Caption: so let&#39;s draw some more

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.979
Caption: try these

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.979
Caption: okay and for these

00:19:09.959 --> 00:19:12.619
Caption: all right

00:19:12.678 --> 00:19:16.219
Caption: our shark fin

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.059
Caption: can you see I&#39;ve got some no you can&#39;t

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.260
Caption: see it at all I&#39;ve got some cheats on

00:19:24.058 --> 00:19:28.099
Caption: there it&#39;s turned out it&#39;s very good

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.099
Caption: right so

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.020
Caption: a meeting between two people

00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:44.819
Caption: now Matsu

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.440
Caption: let me draw Matsu right but I&#39;m going to

00:19:44.819 --> 00:19:48.538
Caption: do in a different order I&#39;m going to do

00:19:46.439 --> 00:19:50.879
Caption: the o

00:19:48.538 --> 00:19:53.519
Caption: I&#39;m going to do the m

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.178
Caption: I&#39;m going to do a u

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.179
Caption: and a z

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.179
Caption: I&#39;ll do them on the screen

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.960
Caption: just check my Pen&#39;s working yeah

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:33.479
Caption: foreign

00:20:55.859 --> 00:21:00.660
Caption: all right shading

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:02.640
Caption: now containers

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.200
Caption: when drawing containers and actually I

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.380
Caption: won&#39;t do it on the white on the on the

00:21:04.199 --> 00:21:06.380
Caption: uh

00:21:06.479 --> 00:21:12.058
Caption: right draw the words

00:21:10.199 --> 00:21:16.279
Caption: then draw the Box around it if you draw

00:21:12.058 --> 00:21:16.279
Caption: the Box first your words won&#39;t fit

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.719
Caption: all right

00:21:22.319 --> 00:21:26.880
Caption: so you know just being able to all right

00:21:24.719 --> 00:21:29.099
Caption: I&#39;m drawing a an architectural diagram

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.619
Caption: and I&#39;ve got a secure area dropping a

00:21:29.099 --> 00:21:33.839
Caption: dropping a lock in a corner that&#39;s

00:21:31.619 --> 00:21:37.260
Caption: either locked or unlocked you can draw

00:21:33.839 --> 00:21:39.479
Caption: that in 10 seconds just to to make it

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:44.119
Caption: you know much easier than writing a

00:21:39.479 --> 00:21:44.119
Caption: secure zone right or unsecure Zone

00:21:45.119 --> 00:21:50.038
Caption: so

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.058
Caption: um I got these two books when I did the

00:21:50.038 --> 00:21:52.558
Caption: training

00:21:51.058 --> 00:21:54.959
Caption: and

00:21:52.558 --> 00:21:57.058
Caption: um they they basically talk through lots

00:21:54.959 --> 00:21:59.279
Caption: of different techniques and shapes and

00:21:57.058 --> 00:22:02.459
Caption: everything I&#39;ve just taken two photos

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:05.280
Caption: just so you can see some of the um the

00:22:02.459 --> 00:22:07.020
Caption: symbols I&#39;ve drawn some already today

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.500
Caption: you would have seen

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.500
Caption: all right

00:22:16.079 --> 00:22:20.479
Caption: so I&#39;m going to draw people now

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.979
Caption: because this really comes down to how

00:22:23.699 --> 00:22:28.439
Caption: much time you want to spend so it could

00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:31.380
Caption: be as simple as an upside down you and a

00:22:28.439 --> 00:22:32.759
Caption: line and it looks like a person right a

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.500
Caption: little bit of shading helps it even if

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.900
Caption: you&#39;re doing that on the you know on the

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.298
Caption: Run

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:40.859
Caption: you don&#39;t need to put arms but when we

00:22:39.298 --> 00:22:42.119
Caption: draw stick figures you know our arms

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:44.880
Caption: don&#39;t come out of our tummies they come

00:22:42.119 --> 00:22:47.719
Caption: out from under our necks so you draw

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.719
Caption: your arms at the top

00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:55.798
Caption: you know you can start to do

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.798
Caption: actions like falling pointing

00:22:56.239 --> 00:23:01.979
Caption: the difference and in fact if if you&#39;re

00:22:59.099 --> 00:23:04.140
Caption: looking at this guy I copied

00:23:01.979 --> 00:23:06.719
Caption: the guy that&#39;s sort of like two to the

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:10.880
Caption: left and added the legs thickened his

00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:10.880
Caption: arms and added the shading

00:23:12.239 --> 00:23:16.319
Caption: and then sort of the stick figure guy I

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.558
Caption: like these from there I like how they

00:23:16.319 --> 00:23:18.558
Caption: look

00:23:19.739 --> 00:23:25.140
Caption: so again the Whiteboard people these are

00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:29.299
Caption: very quick to draw using the the pen

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.299
Caption: with the chiseled tip

00:23:30.178 --> 00:23:35.519
Caption: and once you get the hang of drawing

00:23:32.038 --> 00:23:38.699
Caption: people then you can you know start to

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.979
Caption: have them do things so a team being led

00:23:38.699 --> 00:23:45.678
Caption: on a journey in a boat

00:23:40.979 --> 00:23:45.678
Caption: very quick easy to to draw

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.719
Caption: is this kind of cool

00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:56.939
Caption: emotions

00:23:55.079 --> 00:23:58.439
Caption: so

00:23:56.939 --> 00:24:00.839
Caption: happy you don&#39;t need to put eyes for

00:23:58.439 --> 00:24:02.459
Caption: happy smiley faces is really all you

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:06.119
Caption: need

00:24:02.459 --> 00:24:08.399
Caption: shock pondering or thought scared

00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:11.219
Caption: if you don&#39;t want to draw faces you can

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:13.380
Caption: use symbolism as well right very easy to

00:24:11.219 --> 00:24:16.619
Caption: uh to just give an idea you can you can

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:18.900
Caption: dress them up in hats here

00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:21.479
Caption: okay now

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:23.099
Caption: if you have to

00:24:21.479 --> 00:24:24.839
Caption: I&#39;m going to say

00:24:23.099 --> 00:24:26.760
Caption: don&#39;t draw

00:24:24.839 --> 00:24:30.239
Caption: don&#39;t draw the stick man

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:32.880
Caption: it&#39;s just as easy to draw two long legs

00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:36.380
Caption: and a pair of arms and it just comes

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.380
Caption: across as a lot better right

00:24:37.918 --> 00:24:46.880
Caption: so I&#39;ll save I&#39;ll give this to you as a

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.880
Caption: as a a JPEG afterwards as well

00:24:48.719 --> 00:24:54.658
Caption: so writing is the next thing

00:24:51.959 --> 00:24:57.538
Caption: and this is a thing I hate

00:24:54.659 --> 00:25:00.179
Caption: so this is my writing

00:24:57.538 --> 00:25:02.399
Caption: all right a shocking

00:25:00.178 --> 00:25:04.918
Caption: I can barely read it

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.539
Caption: and if I have to do something fast and

00:25:04.918 --> 00:25:09.000
Caption: if I&#39;m nervous like in a room of people

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:12.658
Caption: it gets even worse

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:16.380
Caption: so this is the becablo style of writing

00:25:12.659 --> 00:25:18.840
Caption: okay and the one thing is it&#39;s really

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:22.199
Caption: compact right much much more compact

00:25:18.839 --> 00:25:24.178
Caption: than my handwriting so you can fit it

00:25:22.199 --> 00:25:26.880
Caption: into flip charts really easily you can

00:25:24.178 --> 00:25:30.000
Caption: get a lot more letters in so it&#39;s good

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:33.500
Caption: and the thing that makes it readable is

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.798
Caption: the really tall skinny

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.798
Caption: lowercase characters

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:44.579
Caption: now Concepts sucks at this

00:25:42.599 --> 00:25:47.819
Caption: this is the only font you have in

00:25:44.579 --> 00:25:49.619
Caption: Concepts it&#39;s helvetica or aerial and

00:25:47.819 --> 00:25:51.899
Caption: it&#39;s really long and you don&#39;t get a

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:55.319
Caption: choice it&#39;s one they say fonts are

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:58.380
Caption: coming later next year but

00:25:55.319 --> 00:26:00.178
Caption: um so that means I have to handwrite

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:02.760
Caption: everything

00:26:00.178 --> 00:26:04.500
Caption: so how do I do that when my writing

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.539
Caption: sucks

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.760
Caption: well

00:26:06.538 --> 00:26:10.079
Caption: I&#39;ve made my own font of all the letters

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:14.459
Caption: I use

00:26:10.079 --> 00:26:17.479
Caption: and then I copy paste

00:26:14.459 --> 00:26:17.479
Caption: and manually

00:26:18.239 --> 00:26:25.038
Caption: Kern

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.039
Caption: and this this kind of sucks right

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.380
Caption: it kind of looks neat when you&#39;re

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.599
Caption: watching it and my teammates when they

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:33.479
Caption: see me doing this they kind of you know

00:26:30.599 --> 00:26:34.979
Caption: that sort of satisfying videos that you

00:26:33.479 --> 00:26:37.678
Caption: see where people are lining up the

00:26:34.979 --> 00:26:40.678
Caption: letters and well other things so that&#39;s

00:26:37.678 --> 00:26:43.380
Caption: how I do this it takes a long time

00:26:40.678 --> 00:26:46.619
Caption: um so I have a shortcut

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:49.558
Caption: and I have a um I use a lucidchart as

00:26:46.619 --> 00:26:53.279
Caption: well so I&#39;ve hand drawn a font that

00:26:49.558 --> 00:26:55.199
Caption: kinda matches with looser chart so I

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:59.760
Caption: will sometimes use this instead of the

00:26:55.199 --> 00:27:00.959
Caption: vocabulary font and if I go to here

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.880
Caption: um

00:27:00.959 --> 00:27:06.178
Caption: I didn&#39;t write that I went into

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:09.479
Caption: lucidchart I typed it in I saved it as a

00:27:06.178 --> 00:27:11.880
Caption: transparent jpeg I airdropped it onto

00:27:09.479 --> 00:27:13.859
Caption: the iPad I imported it in and and

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.900
Caption: dropped it into my diagram and that&#39;s

00:27:13.859 --> 00:27:17.339
Caption: much faster than writing paragraphs so

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.440
Caption: if I have to write paragraphs and put it

00:27:17.339 --> 00:27:21.298
Caption: in mostly I don&#39;t because mostly I&#39;m

00:27:19.439 --> 00:27:23.579
Caption: just drawing pictures but if I have to

00:27:21.298 --> 00:27:26.519
Caption: that&#39;s the way I go

00:27:23.579 --> 00:27:30.359
Caption: so I&#39;m really looking forward to our

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:33.979
Caption: Concepts supporting more fonts

00:27:30.359 --> 00:27:33.979
Caption: so actually going back to this

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:40.760
Caption: um and the

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.760
Caption: um it improves

00:27:41.239 --> 00:27:48.798
Caption: memory right if I were to bring up

00:27:45.538 --> 00:27:48.798
Caption: the original flip chart

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.739
Caption: where was a helicopter

00:27:51.119 --> 00:27:55.140
Caption: hands up

00:27:52.739 --> 00:27:57.119
Caption: was it there number two

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.260
Caption: no it pans out when I go to the right

00:27:57.119 --> 00:28:00.119
Caption: one

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.739
Caption: it was five yeah

00:28:00.119 --> 00:28:04.678
Caption: all right

00:28:01.739 --> 00:28:06.359
Caption: so had I written down the helicopters as

00:28:04.678 --> 00:28:08.839
Caption: a list you probably wouldn&#39;t remember it

00:28:06.359 --> 00:28:08.839
Caption: right

00:28:11.939 --> 00:28:17.459
Caption: faces I&#39;m almost done

00:28:15.538 --> 00:28:19.619
Caption: so

00:28:17.459 --> 00:28:23.239
Caption: everyone want to draw this

00:28:19.619 --> 00:28:23.239
Caption: step one draw the nose

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.779
Caption: then a smile

00:28:36.359 --> 00:28:38.538
Caption: foreign

00:28:46.939 --> 00:28:50.719
Caption: 66 for eyes

00:28:56.159 --> 00:28:59.120
Caption: some spiky hair

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.599
Caption: chin

00:29:04.859 --> 00:29:08.099
Caption: a neck

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:11.000
Caption: collar

00:29:08.099 --> 00:29:11.000
Caption: and shoulders

00:29:20.178 --> 00:29:25.699
Caption: let&#39;s start that again

00:29:23.099 --> 00:29:25.699
Caption: a nose

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:29.120
Caption: a mustache

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.479
Caption: the same ear

00:29:33.959 --> 00:29:36.798
Caption: a pair of glasses

00:29:38.219 --> 00:29:41.119
Caption: a chin

00:29:41.159 --> 00:29:44.059
Caption: make the neck

00:29:44.579 --> 00:29:47.298
Caption: bolt head

00:29:52.979 --> 00:29:55.520
Caption: right

00:29:56.099 --> 00:30:00.000
Caption: and that&#39;s done

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:02.459
Caption: so

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.579
Caption: kind of on time

00:30:02.459 --> 00:30:09.298
Caption: who thinks they can do that

00:30:05.579 --> 00:30:13.278
Caption: a few more all right that&#39;s good

00:30:09.298 --> 00:30:13.278
Caption: so my journey

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.419
Caption: where are we

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.599
Caption: if I go back to now

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.119
Caption: um

00:30:24.599 --> 00:30:28.619
Caption: these are some diagrams that I&#39;ve

00:30:27.119 --> 00:30:31.140
Caption: started so

00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:34.140
Caption: before the cablo this is just a picture

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:37.440
Caption: from a whiteboard that are driven right

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:39.479
Caption: are drawn so scribbling coloring in that

00:30:37.439 --> 00:30:41.639
Caption: sort of thing

00:30:39.479 --> 00:30:44.398
Caption: um so I tend to call this a light board

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:46.799
Caption: where you&#39;re you&#39;re drawing with light

00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:49.619
Caption: on a black background

00:30:46.798 --> 00:30:53.219
Caption: after vocablo

00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:54.779
Caption: I switched to a whiteboard so this was

00:30:53.219 --> 00:30:57.479
Caption: my first attempt

00:30:54.779 --> 00:31:00.179
Caption: and this was in a week of of using the

00:30:57.479 --> 00:31:03.119
Caption: Tableau I had redrawn

00:31:00.178 --> 00:31:06.558
Caption: um using the kevlow technique of shading

00:31:03.119 --> 00:31:09.599
Caption: and coloring and the shapes Etc

00:31:06.558 --> 00:31:12.119
Caption: and then

00:31:09.599 --> 00:31:15.479
Caption: this is kind of where I am now where I&#39;m

00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:17.399
Caption: I&#39;m painstakingly neat because I use

00:31:15.479 --> 00:31:20.278
Caption: these over and over and over again it&#39;s

00:31:17.399 --> 00:31:21.480
Caption: like a it&#39;s like a book you know reading

00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:23.760
Caption: a story to a classroom where I&#39;m

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:25.918
Caption: flipping pages so

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.479
Caption: um yeah I&#39;ve put time into into

00:31:25.918 --> 00:31:29.158
Caption: something that I&#39;m going to use more

00:31:27.479 --> 00:31:32.778
Caption: than half a dozen times or in this case

00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:35.820
Caption: a presentation I do once but uh anyway

00:31:32.779 --> 00:31:38.820
Caption: so this is the same version as a light

00:31:35.819 --> 00:31:40.439
Caption: board and Visually I like the the

00:31:38.819 --> 00:31:43.558
Caption: brightness of the imagery on black but

00:31:40.439 --> 00:31:46.918
Caption: it&#39;s a it&#39;s a personal choice

00:31:43.558 --> 00:31:50.939
Caption: now two weeks ago I gave a I gave a talk

00:31:46.918 --> 00:31:51.719
Caption: on data mesh at a

00:31:50.939 --> 00:31:54.959
Caption: um

00:31:51.719 --> 00:31:56.579
Caption: at an event in Perth and I&#39;m not without

00:31:54.959 --> 00:31:59.520
Caption: stepping through it like I stepped

00:31:56.579 --> 00:32:01.079
Caption: through this this was

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.520
Caption: this was the presentation it&#39;s the first

00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:04.859
Caption: time I sort of gave a presentation with

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:09.539
Caption: a tablet and a pen in front of a big

00:32:04.859 --> 00:32:13.520
Caption: room but I tend to have slides in

00:32:09.538 --> 00:32:15.658
Caption: meetings where I do you know agenda

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:17.219
Caption: go through problems where I might

00:32:15.659 --> 00:32:18.179
Caption: document it

00:32:17.219 --> 00:32:21.058
Caption: um

00:32:18.178 --> 00:32:23.219
Caption: uh so on and then you know the the

00:32:21.058 --> 00:32:25.979
Caption: imagery and I&#39;m just panning through

00:32:23.219 --> 00:32:27.959
Caption: this I will if there are things that are

00:32:25.979 --> 00:32:29.959
Caption: I need to bring in I&#39;ll bring him in as

00:32:27.959 --> 00:32:32.099
Caption: a screenshot and just sort of frame them

00:32:29.959 --> 00:32:34.678
Caption: in my

00:32:32.099 --> 00:32:36.058
Caption: um in my light boards you can see here

00:32:34.678 --> 00:32:37.619
Caption: my people

00:32:36.058 --> 00:32:39.538
Caption: okay

00:32:37.619 --> 00:32:42.058
Caption: um drawing interesting things like uh

00:32:39.538 --> 00:32:43.918
Caption: for example you know finding a balance

00:32:42.058 --> 00:32:47.760
Caption: between central and decentralized

00:32:43.918 --> 00:32:50.278
Caption: governance putting on a seesaw just

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.899
Caption: coming up with ideas about how you want

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:54.240
Caption: to portray something that you&#39;re you&#39;re

00:32:51.899 --> 00:32:56.960
Caption: talking about so this is this was a

00:32:54.239 --> 00:32:59.158
Caption: 20-minute talk and that was everything

00:32:56.959 --> 00:33:00.979
Caption: that I had talked about and I&#39;m going to

00:32:59.159 --> 00:33:03.960
Caption: switch to a different

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:06.119
Caption: document now so this is going to go away

00:33:03.959 --> 00:33:08.298
Caption: and I&#39;m going to go in here

00:33:06.119 --> 00:33:08.298
Caption: foreign

00:33:09.619 --> 00:33:14.099
Caption: storytelling

00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:16.140
Caption: sort of light board

00:33:14.099 --> 00:33:19.439
Caption: so again I have my meeting hygiene

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:23.099
Caption: slides okay which I go through

00:33:19.439 --> 00:33:26.038
Caption: uh history of confluent and Apache Kafka

00:33:23.099 --> 00:33:27.839
Caption: and then I have my storytelling so all

00:33:26.038 --> 00:33:31.199
Caption: this

00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:33.599
Caption: I hand draw right and I can bring them

00:33:31.199 --> 00:33:34.859
Caption: up and shut them down depending on you

00:33:33.599 --> 00:33:36.298
Caption: know the story I want to take there&#39;s

00:33:34.859 --> 00:33:39.298
Caption: about six stories in this light board

00:33:36.298 --> 00:33:44.959
Caption: everything is turned on

00:33:39.298 --> 00:33:44.959
Caption: and that&#39;s it so that&#39;s my presentation

00:33:47.459 --> 00:33:51.298
Caption: questions how much time do we have

00:33:49.678 --> 00:33:53.219
Caption: because I think I&#39;m probably are we at

00:33:51.298 --> 00:33:55.699
Caption: time

00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:55.699
Caption: okay

00:34:10.678 --> 00:34:14.398
Caption: um how you get the ideas to generate

00:34:12.479 --> 00:34:15.719
Caption: these stories

00:34:14.398 --> 00:34:19.079
Caption: um

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:20.098
Caption: some of them are from so it might be a

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.859
Caption: presentation

00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:25.379
Caption: or it might be a YouTube video that has

00:34:22.858 --> 00:34:27.239
Caption: a concept around let&#39;s just say it&#39;s you

00:34:25.378 --> 00:34:30.239
Caption: know in my role I might need to talk

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:32.280
Caption: about data warehouse modernization so

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:35.178
Caption: I&#39;ll take ideas and I will typically

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:38.219
Caption: start with a flow so I will scribble out

00:34:35.178 --> 00:34:40.378
Caption: in a layer within Concepts just wording

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:43.020
Caption: or pictures as to what as to how I

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:46.439
Caption: wanted to to make the story

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:48.959
Caption: and then I start from the first part to

00:34:46.439 --> 00:34:50.878
Caption: the last part drawing out the bits and

00:34:48.959 --> 00:34:52.378
Caption: pieces that I want to talk about and

00:34:50.878 --> 00:34:55.020
Caption: then just sort of Crossing them off as I

00:34:52.378 --> 00:34:57.059
Caption: go all right and then once so what I

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:59.459
Caption: haven&#39;t done is I within Concepts and

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:01.680
Caption: the way I&#39;ve worked this is I have all

00:34:59.459 --> 00:35:03.479
Caption: the different steps in my story in

00:35:01.679 --> 00:35:05.760
Caption: different layers so what I was doing

00:35:03.479 --> 00:35:10.679
Caption: with the pen and in fact what I can show

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:12.359
Caption: you is in Concepts I can it has a

00:35:10.679 --> 00:35:14.159
Caption: presentation mode which is good what I&#39;m

00:35:12.358 --> 00:35:15.199
Caption: going to go here is just to mirror

00:35:14.159 --> 00:35:19.500
Caption: everything

00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:22.219
Caption: and now you can see the toolbar so over

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:25.020
Caption: on the right in this one there are

00:35:22.219 --> 00:35:28.739
Caption: layers and I can turn these on and off

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:31.919
Caption: as I go so building out that story once

00:35:28.739 --> 00:35:35.280
Caption: I do one new layer draw the new one new

00:35:31.919 --> 00:35:36.959
Caption: layer draw the new one and also with the

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.839
Caption: um with the like if I&#39;m drawing out

00:35:36.959 --> 00:35:43.199
Caption: icons so here where I&#39;ve got shading

00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:45.900
Caption: that&#39;s potentially three layers so the

00:35:43.199 --> 00:35:47.338
Caption: the line around the outside the coloring

00:35:45.899 --> 00:35:48.598
Caption: on the inside and then if I want to put

00:35:47.339 --> 00:35:50.280
Caption: a shadow in there there&#39;s a layer

00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:52.579
Caption: underneath which I then combined to that

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.579
Caption: object

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.239
Caption: uh I think you might have answered this

00:35:59.879 --> 00:36:06.179
Caption: but are these like reusable company yes

00:36:03.239 --> 00:36:09.598
Caption: yes so what I do is um over you can see

00:36:06.179 --> 00:36:12.358
Caption: my screen now on the left I have things

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:15.599
Caption: that I&#39;ve imported into a toolbar so I

00:36:12.358 --> 00:36:18.959
Caption: can uh for example

00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:21.540
Caption: if I do that right drop them in and use

00:36:18.959 --> 00:36:24.358
Caption: them so the things I use more I drop in

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:26.219
Caption: so it makes it much easier to do and and

00:36:24.358 --> 00:36:30.019
Caption: then hence it becomes a lot faster than

00:36:26.219 --> 00:36:30.020
Caption: drawing it on a on a piece of paper

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:36.479
Caption: now the funny thing is so in Concepts uh

00:36:33.479 --> 00:36:39.659
Caption: a double tap is undo and a triple tap is

00:36:36.479 --> 00:36:42.060
Caption: redo and occasionally now if I&#39;m doing

00:36:39.659 --> 00:36:44.039
Caption: this and i stuff it up I&#39;ll do that

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:46.140
Caption: and it&#39;s like you know it it just

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.459
Caption: becomes natural once you start using

00:36:46.139 --> 00:36:48.959
Caption: this all the time and you go into other

00:36:47.459 --> 00:36:52.040
Caption: apps and I double tap I know I&#39;ve got to

00:36:48.959 --> 00:36:52.040
Caption: hit the undo button but

00:37:01.439 --> 00:37:06.598
Caption: hello

00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:09.899
Caption: are you able to pre-configure the views

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:11.880
Caption: for the storytelling steps are you

00:37:09.899 --> 00:37:14.399
Caption: constantly now that no I&#39;m constantly

00:37:11.879 --> 00:37:16.439
Caption: paging right okay

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:17.819
Caption: um I have thought about drawing them up

00:37:16.439 --> 00:37:20.699
Caption: and then potentially using something

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:23.099
Caption: like Prezi but

00:37:20.699 --> 00:37:25.260
Caption: when you&#39;re in a meeting it sometimes

00:37:23.099 --> 00:37:29.099
Caption: you&#39;ll get taken off track and doing

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:31.679
Caption: that in a Prezi is is a bit hard so you

00:37:29.099 --> 00:37:35.160
Caption: just have to I mean I&#39;m kind of used to

00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:36.598
Caption: it and it makes it interactive and I

00:37:35.159 --> 00:37:40.520
Caption: always get lots of feedback at the end

00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:40.520
Caption: of a meeting how did you do that right

00:37:42.599 --> 00:37:45.380
Caption: foreign

00:37:46.219 --> 00:37:51.598
Caption: do you have like any tips for showing

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:53.699
Caption: how to do uh like

00:37:51.599 --> 00:37:55.680
Caption: cleaning up like relations between

00:37:53.699 --> 00:37:57.239
Caption: things like this talks this is grouped

00:37:55.679 --> 00:37:59.280
Caption: of this

00:37:57.239 --> 00:38:01.679
Caption: um it kind of like how you do it on

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:04.140
Caption: paper so

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:05.699
Caption: um if I were to to just draw something

00:38:04.139 --> 00:38:08.219
Caption: you know

00:38:05.699 --> 00:38:10.399
Caption: uh actually that&#39;s Let Me So within here

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:14.838
Caption: you can see you can change

00:38:10.399 --> 00:38:14.838
Caption: how things work so

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:20.939
Caption: you know doing it very quickly but you

00:38:18.959 --> 00:38:22.320
Caption: can see in this diagram how I&#39;ve got

00:38:20.939 --> 00:38:24.000
Caption: like lots of arrows and things that

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.479
Caption: that&#39;s I

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.159
Caption: I have a um boxes inside other boxes

00:38:27.479 --> 00:38:31.338
Caption: um you know connectors that you hand

00:38:29.159 --> 00:38:31.338
Caption: draw

00:38:31.919 --> 00:38:35.098
Caption: is there any sort of thing you&#39;d like to

00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:38.239
Caption: sort of

00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:38.240
Caption: go beyond that or

00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:43.740
Caption: no it&#39;s um so one of the things I do is

00:38:42.419 --> 00:38:46.799
Caption: I&#39;ll draw something and I think well

00:38:43.739 --> 00:38:51.479
Caption: that doesn&#39;t fit so then what I need to

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:53.959
Caption: do is you know I&#39;ll be selecting large

00:38:51.479 --> 00:38:53.959
Caption: areas

00:38:54.419 --> 00:38:58.379
Caption: and then I have to wait for that because

00:38:56.159 --> 00:38:59.459
Caption: that&#39;s quite complex and then I&#39;ll move

00:38:58.379 --> 00:39:02.219
Caption: them around

00:38:59.459 --> 00:39:03.598
Caption: right so quite often when I&#39;m doing the

00:39:02.219 --> 00:39:05.219
Caption: drawings

00:39:03.599 --> 00:39:06.720
Caption: um it doesn&#39;t work the way I want it and

00:39:05.219 --> 00:39:09.078
Caption: then I have to start reorganizing the

00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:09.078
Caption: puzzle

00:39:11.879 --> 00:39:18.779
Caption: have you heard of the tool Miro yes okay

00:39:15.899 --> 00:39:20.098
Caption: yep so Miro is very good for those

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:23.040
Caption: online where you&#39;ve got lots of people

00:39:20.099 --> 00:39:24.359
Caption: working at the same time but most of

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.160
Caption: those people are working with a mouse

00:39:24.358 --> 00:39:27.899
Caption: right you&#39;re you&#39;re putting a Post-It

00:39:26.159 --> 00:39:31.078
Caption: note on a piece of paper and you&#39;re

00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:33.179
Caption: drawing drawing with a mouse is so hard

00:39:31.079 --> 00:39:37.700
Caption: yeah yeah

00:39:33.179 --> 00:39:37.699
Caption: but miro&#39;s cool it is right for

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.820
Caption: yeah yeah

00:39:41.639 --> 00:39:47.159
Caption: so how do you share your slides after

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:49.020
Caption: presentations ah so after I&#39;ve

00:39:47.159 --> 00:39:50.578
Caption: um I&#39;ve done something and and typically
