Caption: about hate going on I believe it&#39;s over

00:42:43.809 --> 00:42:47.289
Caption: anymore Nagy it&#39;s a trouble hang out at

00:42:46.029 --> 00:42:48.640
Caption: three hundred engineers and none of them

00:42:47.289 --> 00:42:50.380

00:42:48.639 --> 00:42:52.808
Caption: consumers do and he wants to tell you

00:42:50.379 --> 00:42:54.848
Caption: I&#39;ll kid go tap-tap-tap trying to make

00:42:52.809 --> 00:42:57.459
