00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:15.520
Caption: hello hello welcome welcome to DDD so

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:17.619
Caption: kick off today I like to introduce you

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.739
Caption: to Andrew and Andrews gonna talk to you

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.290
Caption: today Andrew from Perth I&#39;m a dad he&#39;s

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:27.729
Caption: going to talk to you today about UX

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:32.459
Caption: design and VR and AR so without further

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:35.919
Caption: any further ado here&#39;s Andrew thank you

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:37.538
Caption: so can everyone is that too loud that&#39;s

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:38.619
Caption: good okay so I&#39;m gonna be trying to

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.469
Caption: tease out the difference between the

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:43.328
Caption: hype about VR and the reality of where

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:48.129
Caption: it might go and what that means to a UX

00:00:43.328 --> 00:00:50.259
Caption: community now the I did a little

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:57.749
Caption: research so the average age of people in

00:00:50.259 --> 00:01:01.088
Caption: this room is apparently 32 years old now

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:03.969
Caption: the question is how long are you

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.250
Caption: planning to be working and according to

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.959
Caption: these statistics it&#39;ll be another half a

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.658
Caption: century so just imagine the kind of

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:16.118
Caption: changes that are going to occur during

00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:18.489
Caption: your career and that&#39;s really the kind

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:24.310
Caption: of big perspective I want to bring to

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:26.949
Caption: this talk so to put in the in law in a

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:29.438
Caption: in the for the purposes of presenting

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:32.529
Caption: that context a little trip back in the

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.319
Caption: history so most of what we have was

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:38.828
Caption: already being prototypes in the 1960s

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:41.649
Caption: and at the same time as that there was

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.259
Caption: this big explosion in science fiction

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.450
Caption: and a lot of that was about augmentation

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.250
Caption: and how technology could enhance the

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:49.538
Caption: experience of being human some of that

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.399
Caption: was very negative but a lot of it was

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:56.649
Caption: very optimistic and that&#39;s the dream of

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.079
Caption: computer science is that we can remember

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.659
Caption: more find out more things communicate

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.829
Caption: more quickly that we can have new ways

00:02:01.658 --> 00:02:10.209
Caption: to create and have new experiences so

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:13.720
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s been the great dream and a

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.150
Caption: part of that was new ways to see and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.848
Caption: what we&#39;re looking at here is a 1968

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:20.848
Caption: very early augmented reality system

00:02:21.048 --> 00:02:30.268
Caption: now during the 1980s that utopian idea

00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:32.488
Caption: became very very strong in popular

00:02:30.268 --> 00:02:34.289
Caption: culture and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all familiar

00:02:32.488 --> 00:02:38.000
Caption: with both of these intellectual

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:40.649
Caption: properties and they&#39;ve had an enormous

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.699
Caption: impact on our perception about how the

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:46.878
Caption: future will be and of course people who

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:49.348
Caption: like to work with computers are probably

00:02:46.878 --> 00:02:51.589
Caption: even more involved with this kind of pop

00:02:49.348 --> 00:02:54.119
Caption: culture than the average person

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:57.509
Caption: yes we&#39;re all nerds we&#39;re all here in

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:59.339
Caption: the room we can we can say that but what

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:00.988
Caption: was what was what&#39;s very cool about it

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.908
Caption: is that they are absolutely anticipating

00:03:00.988 --> 00:03:06.619
Caption: things up here in the top left

00:03:02.908 --> 00:03:09.029
Caption: Doc Brown has got some augmented reality

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:10.108
Caption: sunglasses might be the cheapest prop in

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:12.958
Caption: the history of science fiction but

00:03:10.108 --> 00:03:15.029
Caption: that&#39;s in the story what they do and

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:16.828
Caption: here&#39;s a virtual reality experience and

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:21.298
Caption: then of course there&#39;s a holodeck from

00:03:16.828 --> 00:03:23.878
Caption: Star Trek which gave a view of virtual

00:03:21.298 --> 00:03:25.679
Caption: reality that was so so futuristic that

00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:27.539
Caption: in point of fact it was dangerous you

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:29.698
Caption: could be killed in a virtual reality and

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:32.759
Caption: so forth and so on so this has really

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:35.309
Caption: informed our idea about virtual reality

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:37.439
Caption: and it has become this idea of the

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:41.988
Caption: head-mounted display has become iconic

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.279
Caption: of our progression through technology

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:48.059
Caption: iconic of technological advancement

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:52.169
Caption: after the Second World War and that&#39;s a

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:55.798
Caption: problem and so here we are so this is

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:58.169
Caption: much more recent this is now and yet we

00:03:55.798 --> 00:04:00.658
Caption: still have this incredible image of

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.250
Caption: someone wearing a very high-tech head

00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:04.589
Caption: mounted display or goggles or whatever

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.809
Caption: you want to call it and they&#39;re reaching

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:08.668
Caption: forth into the future always from right

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:12.328
Caption: to left for some composition or graphic

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:14.669
Caption: design reason it&#39;s like a standard and

00:04:12.328 --> 00:04:16.529
Caption: they&#39;re reaching out to the grid the

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:19.908
Caption: mesh the cyberpunk

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:23.429
Caption: cyber future mesh so it&#39;s very powerful

00:04:19.908 --> 00:04:25.859
Caption: and this has existed for as long as

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:28.049
Caption: probably all of us have been alive and

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:29.429
Caption: certainly has existed for that all all

00:04:28.049 --> 00:04:32.329
Caption: the time that all of us have been

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:32.329
Caption: professionals in this field

00:04:33.438 --> 00:04:41.218
Caption: so a trip back to when I didn&#39;t have a

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:45.299
Caption: gray hair in fact I used to have red

00:04:41.218 --> 00:04:48.688
Caption: hair and so this is for achoo a Latino

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:51.569
Caption: virtuality is famous in VR history it

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:53.009
Caption: was the first publicly available VR

00:04:51.569 --> 00:05:02.218
Caption: experience that was even in the ballpark

00:04:53.009 --> 00:05:06.389
Caption: of of a working system and I was walking

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:08.699
Caption: through a video arcade in London in 1992

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:14.759
Caption: and so you can imagine my complete

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:18.509
Caption: delight when I came across this no this

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:22.889
Caption: was my hover board moment I thought I

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:26.098
Caption: have arrived in the future so it was no

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:29.429
Caption: problem for me to shell out the

00:05:26.098 --> 00:05:35.489
Caption: equivalent of xxx $30 now to get into

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:37.468
Caption: this and so I&#39;m gonna the appropriate

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:41.369
Caption: way to describe the experience I had was

00:05:37.468 --> 00:05:44.429
Caption: that it was a experience that&#39;s not

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:48.958
Caption: that&#39;s not official ux talk but that&#39;s

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:50.759
Caption: the experience I had I had I had motion

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:53.219
Caption: sickness I didn&#39;t even understand what I

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.289
Caption: was doing there was a video game in

00:05:53.218 --> 00:05:56.639
Caption: there and I have since doing research

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.419
Caption: discovered that it was almost certainly

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.860
Caption: dactyl nightmare and it was named dactyl

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.199
Caption: nightmare because it was a multiplayer

00:06:01.859 --> 00:06:05.938
Caption: first-person shooter in which there was

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:07.979
Caption: also the added bonus of a pterodactyl

00:06:05.938 --> 00:06:11.158
Caption: who would sweep down pick you up and

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.929
Caption: kill you so I got through my $25 worth

00:06:11.158 --> 00:06:15.419
Caption: of being killed without even realizing

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:17.188
Caption: that was what was happening because the

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.459
Caption: image resolution you see here is on a

00:06:17.188 --> 00:06:23.069
Caption: monitor that&#39;s not what you saw in the

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:28.529
Caption: headset so it was just a lot of very

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:34.829
Caption: laggy blurry pixels and so I am an

00:06:28.528 --> 00:06:36.989
Caption: affirmed VR skeptic so by 1995 Nintendo

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:38.668
Caption: had demonstrated an enormous cost and

00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:41.549
Caption: embarrassment that VR was not going to

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.610
Caption: happen in retail domestic game

00:06:41.549 --> 00:06:45.919
Caption: environments

00:06:43.609 --> 00:06:47.509
Caption: their worst ever selling console

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.000
Caption: although they&#39;re now worth quite a lot

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.740
Caption: of money so if you have one in the retro

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.309
Caption: market retro nostalgia market they

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:59.209
Caption: they&#39;re big so there&#39;s all of these

00:06:55.309 --> 00:07:03.440
Caption: problems with VR these are the alleged

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:07.759
Caption: reasons why we going laser pointer sorry

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:09.529
Caption: about that but the most people say that

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.150
Caption: the problem here is that there&#39;s an

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:13.790
Caption: issue with the low resolution and the

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:16.699
Caption: latency and the lack of good content

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.080
Caption: that people don&#39;t play them the games

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.490
Caption: are the experiences because the content

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:21.079
Caption: is not compelling enough which means

00:07:19.489 --> 00:07:22.489
Caption: there&#39;s no market which means no one

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:25.939
Caption: will spend the money to improve all the

00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:28.399
Caption: issues with lag and latency I don&#39;t

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.200
Caption: believe that if you do a first

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:32.299
Caption: principles UX analysis of what&#39;s going

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.800
Caption: on here with the eye that argument

00:07:32.299 --> 00:07:37.190
Caption: doesn&#39;t stand up and I&#39;m hoping to

00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:40.099
Caption: convince you about that today now what

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:44.720
Caption: has happened since I was a broken young

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:47.660
Caption: man in a gaming arcade in London is all

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.850
Caption: of this shit&#39;s happened now this we are

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.179
Caption: very very familiar with this is the

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.619
Caption: world we live in this has changed our

00:07:52.179 --> 00:07:58.729
Caption: reality has changed everything about the

00:07:54.619 --> 00:08:03.529
Caption: way we live all those products and

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:05.720
Caption: experiences have happened now this is

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:07.369
Caption: science fiction this is stuff that we

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.459
Caption: did not imagine would be happening only

00:08:07.369 --> 00:08:11.449
Caption: 30 years ago it was in science fiction

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:14.899
Caption: but we didn&#39;t think it would actually

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:16.730
Caption: happen to us now we&#39;ve been doing this

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:22.190
Caption: for so long it&#39;s almost become a cliche

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:25.670
Caption: to talk about it now VR has the

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:30.019
Caption: fundamental characteristic that excludes

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:31.760
Caption: the real world to allow immersion but

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:34.640
Caption: actually we do that all the time

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.070
Caption: anyway when you listen to music or read

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.380
Caption: a book or our on the phone talking to

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:43.010
Caption: someone or are just having a flight of

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:45.229
Caption: imagination you are creating immersion

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:49.970
Caption: which doesn&#39;t have to come with the

00:08:45.229 --> 00:08:51.859
Caption: enormous burden of of the hardware an AR

00:08:49.969 --> 00:08:54.049
Caption: has the fundamental characters that

00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:55.820
Caption: overlays layers and we&#39;re doing that all

00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:56.328
Caption: the time and all the digital media we&#39;re

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.559
Caption: already working

00:08:56.328 --> 00:09:01.669
Caption: with already does that as well so where

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:04.610
Caption: I&#39;m getting to with this is that the

00:09:01.669 --> 00:09:10.188
Caption: fundamental problem with VR is that it

00:09:04.609 --> 00:09:11.778
Caption: doesn&#39;t value add you know head mounted

00:09:10.189 --> 00:09:15.319
Caption: displays do not make for a better

00:09:11.778 --> 00:09:17.568
Caption: experience in any way and that&#39;s why

00:09:15.318 --> 00:09:21.678
Caption: people don&#39;t want them not because of

00:09:17.568 --> 00:09:25.178
Caption: low resolution okay so that so we&#39;re

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:28.759
Caption: moving on to the current VR bloom and

00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:32.389
Caption: we&#39;re still here with this iconic thing

00:09:28.758 --> 00:09:35.328
Caption: but to demonstrate very compellingly I

00:09:32.388 --> 00:09:38.838
Caption: hope that nobody wants VR it&#39;s not a

00:09:35.328 --> 00:09:41.688
Caption: value add proposition is the experience

Caption: of sunny now sunny have produced a

00:09:41.689 --> 00:09:47.540
Caption: Playstation gaming system since the

00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:49.879
Caption: 1990s the most the current version is

00:09:47.539 --> 00:09:52.698
Caption: the PlayStation 4 they&#39;ve sold hundreds

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:55.309
Caption: million units three years after they

00:09:52.698 --> 00:09:57.919
Caption: launched that they started selling so

00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:59.749
Caption: this was a $400 PlayStation and then

00:09:57.919 --> 00:10:04.669
Caption: three years ago they started selling the

00:09:59.749 --> 00:10:07.129
Caption: $400 VR extension now four million units

00:10:04.669 --> 00:10:09.619
Caption: would make most people happy but I can

00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:13.220
Caption: assure you that Sony will not be

00:10:09.619 --> 00:10:15.709
Caption: impressed with only 4% of people who

00:10:13.219 --> 00:10:18.948
Caption: bought a PlayStation taking up the VR

00:10:15.708 --> 00:10:21.859
Caption: headset I&#39;m prepared to bet that most of

00:10:18.948 --> 00:10:25.518
Caption: those VR headsets are now in the same

00:10:21.859 --> 00:10:28.398
Caption: box as all the unused mobile phones that

00:10:25.518 --> 00:10:32.659
Caption: we&#39;ve all got at home and all the spare

00:10:28.398 --> 00:10:35.539
Caption: internet connection cables it hasn&#39;t

00:10:32.659 --> 00:10:38.539
Caption: taken off and if sunny can&#39;t do it with

00:10:35.539 --> 00:10:43.328
Caption: that installed base it&#39;s not a real

00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:46.849
Caption: thing to me that was the test point okay

00:10:43.328 --> 00:10:51.738
Caption: but what has happened is this gigantic

00:10:46.849 --> 00:10:53.808
Caption: event which is that Facebook went

00:10:51.739 --> 00:10:56.088
Caption: bonkers and spent three billion dollars

00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:59.660
Caption: buying out a small startup company who

00:10:56.088 --> 00:11:00.948
Caption: had sold almost no product and didn&#39;t

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:03.918
Caption: even believe their thing they were

00:11:00.948 --> 00:11:07.368
Caption: selling was yet a finished product

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:10.039
Caption: now does that mean that the VR the

00:11:07.369 --> 00:11:11.480
Caption: domestic home retail VR entertainment

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:14.299
Caption: market is a real thing that&#39;s going to

00:11:11.479 --> 00:11:17.208
Caption: happen well no because organizations

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:19.549
Caption: like Facebook have got more money than

00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:21.708
Caption: God and they&#39;ve got to do something with

00:11:19.549 --> 00:11:23.328
Caption: it now this is happening to us it&#39;s our

00:11:21.708 --> 00:11:25.669
Caption: fault because we watched all of those

00:11:23.328 --> 00:11:28.818
Caption: ads which all of this money was earned

00:11:25.669 --> 00:11:31.008
Caption: from on all that social media and that&#39;s

00:11:28.818 --> 00:11:32.539
Caption: why they&#39;ve got this money but what&#39;s

00:11:31.008 --> 00:11:35.028
Caption: happening here is that organizations

00:11:32.539 --> 00:11:37.609
Caption: that sighs have got to do something to

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:39.708
Caption: own the future market Facebook&#39;s under

00:11:37.609 --> 00:11:43.068
Caption: enormous pressure from other competitors

00:11:39.708 --> 00:11:47.119
Caption: now facing possible government control

00:11:43.068 --> 00:11:49.278
Caption: and so they and that that long list of

00:11:47.119 --> 00:11:52.338
Caption: other people who are moving into it are

00:11:49.278 --> 00:11:54.409
Caption: now in a titanic war to own what may be

00:11:52.338 --> 00:11:58.008
Caption: the future I&#39;m just going to go back

00:11:54.409 --> 00:12:00.619
Caption: here because now the other thing is that

00:11:58.008 --> 00:12:04.309
Caption: most of those organizations are big

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:07.219
Caption: enough to put this money into VR for a

00:12:04.309 --> 00:12:09.679
Caption: very simple reason they can afford to

00:12:07.219 --> 00:12:11.539
Caption: lose it but whatever comes out of this

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:14.359
Caption: they will have developed an enormous

00:12:11.539 --> 00:12:16.578
Caption: number of new IPS technology and

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:19.159
Caption: software which they will then utilize in

00:12:16.578 --> 00:12:21.380
Caption: future so for them it&#39;s a great big

00:12:19.159 --> 00:12:23.208
Caption: gamble stroke experiment which will

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:29.419
Caption: probably work out they&#39;re not going to

00:12:23.208 --> 00:12:32.659
Caption: go bust out of this and that means that

00:12:29.419 --> 00:12:36.739
Caption: all of those technical problems with VR

00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:38.958
Caption: headsets and AR headsets will be solved

00:12:36.739 --> 00:12:39.518
Caption: there won&#39;t be any more problems Thank

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:44.239
Caption: You Derek

00:12:39.518 --> 00:12:46.068
Caption: okay so what does that mean to us in the

00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:48.799
Caption: UX business well the people who are

00:12:46.068 --> 00:12:51.588
Caption: going to have the money to pay for these

00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:53.539
Caption: incredibly high-tech headsets and so

00:12:51.588 --> 00:12:56.659
Caption: forth and so on are not individuals it&#39;s

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:58.880
Caption: corporations it&#39;s the same market we&#39;re

00:12:56.659 --> 00:13:00.619
Caption: already working with people

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.208
Caption: organizations who can afford

00:13:00.619 --> 00:13:03.648
Caption: we&#39;ve got perfectly good economic

00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:05.859
Caption: rationale for why they need to solve

00:13:03.648 --> 00:13:05.859
Caption: these problems

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:11.708
Caption: so the value add that head-mounted

00:13:09.198 --> 00:13:15.528
Caption: displays whether it&#39;s VR or a our offer

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:18.109
Caption: to me is not higher resolution it&#39;s that

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:19.578
Caption: it&#39;s hands-free and that&#39;s critically

00:13:18.109 --> 00:13:21.369
Caption: important in a whole range of very

00:13:19.578 --> 00:13:23.289
Caption: important industries

00:13:21.369 --> 00:13:26.559
Caption: where you for safety reasons and

00:13:23.289 --> 00:13:28.750
Caption: mobility reasons and because people are

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:31.539
Caption: doing stuff with their hands that&#39;s the

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.250
Caption: real value add now the really

00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:37.119
Caption: interesting thing about this area here

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:39.010
Caption: is that hands-free is going to

00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:41.380
Caption: dramatically and radically change the

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:43.510
Caption: way you eyes have to be this is not

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.940
Caption: going to be the hamburger icon in the

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:47.559
Caption: top right hand screen in your vision

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.929
Caption: these are cognitively demanding

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:53.109
Caption: environments so these are going to have

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:55.270
Caption: to be voice but voice won&#39;t work if

00:13:53.109 --> 00:13:57.250
Caption: you&#39;re in a noisy environment gesture

00:13:55.270 --> 00:14:00.088
Caption: but that won&#39;t work if you&#39;re gonna use

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:02.380
Caption: your hands possibly face movements

00:14:00.088 --> 00:14:04.838
Caption: possibly eye tracking and then

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:09.039
Caption: excitingly and scarily at the same time

00:14:04.838 --> 00:14:11.700
Caption: brain computer interfaces now I did some

00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:14.349
Caption: research about this other weird scary

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:17.109
Caption: dystopian science fiction thing and I

00:14:14.349 --> 00:14:18.880
Caption: regret to tell you it is a thing it is

00:14:17.109 --> 00:14:20.349
Caption: really happening it&#39;s come out of

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.729
Caption: research about how to repair damaged

00:14:20.349 --> 00:14:28.319
Caption: nerves and so basically this is gonna be

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:30.130
Caption: either like heart monitor pads on you

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.500
Caption: and now what&#39;s going to make that

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:38.169
Caption: possible for your thoughts of that

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:40.690
Caption: simple direction and selection is AI so

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:43.269
Caption: AI is going to be able to filter out of

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:46.000
Caption: the noise of your body that kind of

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.970
Caption: information and then the other big value

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.570
Caption: out that&#39;s going to make these headsets

00:14:47.969 --> 00:14:54.549
Caption: very interesting to industry is AI more

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:56.820
Caption: generally so it&#39;s going to be able to do

00:14:54.549 --> 00:14:59.440
Caption: all of those things and that&#39;s going to

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:02.289
Caption: make for a very very powerful

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:05.609
Caption: combination so what I&#39;m basically saying

00:15:02.289 --> 00:15:07.989
Caption: here is that in the entertainment world

00:15:05.609 --> 00:15:10.299
Caption: in the domestic particular the domestic

00:15:07.989 --> 00:15:11.200
Caption: in games area people are not going to be

00:15:10.299 --> 00:15:13.630
Caption: watching TV

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.480
Caption: with head mounted displays it doesn&#39;t

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:18.338
Caption: value-add and that&#39;s probably good for

00:15:16.479 --> 00:15:20.049
Caption: us because it means our traditional

00:15:18.338 --> 00:15:22.179
Caption: clients are going to be employing us to

00:15:20.049 --> 00:15:23.229
Caption: do this stuff so I&#39;m just going to run

00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:25.630
Caption: through very quickly through how I

00:15:23.229 --> 00:15:28.028
Caption: imagine this is a kind of scenario so

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:30.309
Caption: I&#39;ve chosen what it&#39;s like to be an

00:15:28.028 --> 00:15:32.529
Caption: ambulance crew you&#39;re first responding

00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:34.080
Caption: to some awful incident and let&#39;s just

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.149
Caption: say it&#39;s a car crash

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.929
Caption: this is obviously highly cognitively

00:15:36.148 --> 00:15:41.849
Caption: difficult and what&#39;s different for

00:15:39.929 --> 00:15:43.619
Caption: ambulance and paramedics is that they&#39;re

00:15:41.849 --> 00:15:45.509
Caption: turning up to a real-world location

00:15:43.619 --> 00:15:48.419
Caption: completely outside the control space of

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:52.619
Caption: a hospital they never know what they&#39;re

00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:53.909
Caption: going to find so this is exactly the

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:57.869
Caption: kind of environment where you would love

00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:58.889
Caption: it if you had some kind of head mounted

00:15:57.869 --> 00:16:01.078
Caption: display that allowed you to work with

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:04.260
Caption: your hands and it was assisting you

00:16:01.078 --> 00:16:07.289
Caption: without getting in your face so there is

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.208
Caption: no interface visually but it&#39;s checking

00:16:07.289 --> 00:16:11.639
Caption: it&#39;s identifying things in the object

00:16:09.208 --> 00:16:13.859
Caption: identifying hazards and communicating

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:17.010
Caption: information like for example you arrive

00:16:13.859 --> 00:16:20.159
Caption: at an accident and you find the ID of

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:23.100
Caption: the person or even face recognize them

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:25.648
Caption: this happens automatically and you

00:16:23.099 --> 00:16:27.750
Caption: simply show the driver&#39;s license for a

00:16:25.648 --> 00:16:29.760
Caption: moment in your field of view knowing

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:31.859
Caption: that the AI has already worked out who

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.708
Caption: that person is and is currently calling

00:16:31.859 --> 00:16:36.299
Caption: up their medical records to find out

00:16:34.708 --> 00:16:38.880
Caption: what they&#39;re allergic to what

00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:40.739
Caption: pre-existing conditions they have you&#39;re

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.720
Caption: making your assessment and you need

00:16:40.739 --> 00:16:44.909
Caption: merely need to speak that assessment and

00:16:42.719 --> 00:16:46.409
Caption: that assessment is now being transmitted

00:16:44.909 --> 00:16:48.750
Caption: to the nearest hospital where this

00:16:46.409 --> 00:16:51.539
Caption: patient will be transported once they&#39;re

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:55.520
Caption: stabilized buying more time making that

00:16:51.539 --> 00:16:57.719
Caption: hospital more ready but additionally

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:01.440
Caption: what these systems would do they would

00:16:57.719 --> 00:17:04.438
Caption: allow the the user the other person at

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.510
Caption: risk to be assessed for stress and so

00:17:04.438 --> 00:17:08.578
Caption: forth and so on okay

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:12.198
Caption: so we&#39;re at the end of this talk now so

00:17:08.578 --> 00:17:15.418
Caption: basically the challenges facing us are

00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:19.318
Caption: those things a lot of this hardware is

00:17:15.418 --> 00:17:21.178
Caption: still in its very early stages but it is

00:17:19.318 --> 00:17:22.918
Caption: definitely coming the amount of money

00:17:21.178 --> 00:17:26.640
Caption: that&#39;s being thrown at this means it

00:17:22.918 --> 00:17:28.259
Caption: will happen and the question that you&#39;ve

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.369
Caption: now got to ask yourself apart from how

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.250
Caption: long are you going to be in this

00:17:29.369 --> 00:17:34.770
Caption: business is what are you going to do

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:36.630
Caption: when your client comes back from a

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:40.229
Caption: meeting with someone else who&#39;s been

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:44.949
Caption: talking about this stuff and they say

00:17:40.229 --> 00:17:51.630
Caption: can you do that thank you very much

00:17:44.949 --> 00:17:51.630
Caption: [Applause]
