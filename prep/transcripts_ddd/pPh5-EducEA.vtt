00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.079
Caption: good friend of mine and also one of the

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.510
Caption: driving forces behind DD Perth

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:14.610
Caption: conference itself and last year Ashley

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.750
Caption: gave us a wonderful gentle introduction

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.000
Caption: to functional programming so he&#39;s back

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.040
Caption: this year again promising an equally

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.169
Caption: gentle B code to us

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:30.029
Caption: introduction to quantum computing please

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:32.579
Caption: welcome Ashley okay hello everyone thank

00:00:30.028 --> 00:00:34.409
Caption: you for coming along quantum computing

00:00:32.578 --> 00:00:35.849
Caption: is a very interesting topic and I think

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.398
Caption: really significant so I think you&#39;ve

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:40.648
Caption: chose the right talk to come along too

00:00:38.398 --> 00:00:42.448
Caption: it&#39;s gonna be a general introduction in

00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:44.128
Caption: the way I ride on the space shuttle is

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.050
Caption: gentle at least a take off it&#39;s going to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.909
Caption: be a bit fast and furious is a lot to

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.619
Caption: get through but hopefully if you can

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.029
Caption: keep up with me most of the way and

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.999
Caption: follow most of what I say I think you&#39;ll

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:57.328
Caption: learn something and see how amazing this

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:59.699
Caption: quantum computing is so the first thing

00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:01.858
Caption: here to talk about is get some history

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.929
Caption: way back in the days in computing we

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.450
Caption: started off with analog computing maybe

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:09.000
Caption: some of you remember the old slide rule

00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:10.829
Caption: here and the idea here is you use a

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.660
Caption: property of classical world like the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.880
Caption: length of a ruler to calculate

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.580
Caption: logarithms and on the right hand side

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:19.769
Caption: here we had a analog computer for

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.990
Caption: calculating Exponential&#39;s you made up

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:23.579
Caption: specular circuits and the voltage in

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:25.769
Caption: that circuit due to the capacitors and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.419
Caption: resistors would show an exponential sign

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:29.909
Caption: so you could use it put in one voltage

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:32.009
Caption: and calculate an exponential so we had

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.700
Caption: these things called analog computers

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.740
Caption: based upon classical physics and these

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:40.709
Caption: were great but of course Along Came our

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:43.110
Caption: digital computers classical digital

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:44.879
Caption: computers and these were fantastic these

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.620
Caption: are based upon classical physics

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:48.899
Caption: although they use semiconductors to

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.819
Caption: implement them and in fact a part of

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.910
Caption: classical computers they try to abstract

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.589
Caption: away from the physics like a 1 and a 0

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.860
Caption: or a true and a false doesn&#39;t matter

00:01:55.589 --> 00:02:01.349
Caption: whether it&#39;s 0.9 volts or 1.1 volts it&#39;s

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.349
Caption: a 1 doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s 0.05 or

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:06.900
Caption: 0.1 volts it&#39;s a zero so they&#39;re trying

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:09.539
Caption: to abstract away from the physics to do

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.039
Caption: classical digital computing and we know

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.798
Caption: about classical digit computing it&#39;s all

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.279
Caption: about ands and ORS and nots and pulling

00:02:13.798 --> 00:02:19.080
Caption: them all together to process the bits

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:21.569
Caption: well there&#39;s something new on the block

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.210
Caption: it&#39;s called quantum computing and it&#39;s

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.160
Caption: crazy it&#39;s the next revolution in

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.830
Caption: computing and I don&#39;t say that lightly

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.750
Caption: it&#39;s gonna be really big and I want to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.910
Caption: try and explain it to you today it&#39;s

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.639
Caption: based on the quantum world not on the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.430
Caption: classical physics quantum physics but I

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:41.339
Caption: have to be careful here because the

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:44.069
Caption: quantum world is quite bizarre and so

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:45.509
Caption: you may find your head exploding so I

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.220
Caption: can&#39;t guarantee you anything I will

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:50.339
Caption: promise you you know you may not explode

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.800
Caption: in fact here the exploding syndrome is a

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:54.119
Caption: real thing but hopefully we&#39;ll get

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.000
Caption: through it without your head exploding

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:58.440
Caption: we&#39;ll see how we go so a couple of

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.729
Caption: things to talk about introduction here

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.529
Caption: this is what I want to talk about today

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:03.000
Caption: I want to give you an overview and

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:04.800
Caption: introduce our done that I want to give

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.389
Caption: you quantum mechanics some basics to

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.860
Caption: help you understand things because the

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.229
Caption: quantum world is really different than

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.570
Caption: the classical world talk about how we do

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:14.849
Caption: computing in the quantum world talk

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.430
Caption: about quantum computers what do they

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.170
Caption: look like will they be made of and see

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:21.208
Caption: some applications where they become

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.860
Caption: really useful and we&#39;re starting to see

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:24.630
Caption: something along those lines already and

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.750
Caption: we&#39;ll wind up and talk about of the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.019
Caption: future so other points just about myself

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.410
Caption: here too I have a background in academia

00:03:30.018 --> 00:03:36.559
Caption: in physics computer science AI and IT

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.610
Caption: but I also like to work in industry

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:40.860
Caption: consulting and professional training

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.139
Caption: I&#39;ve done jobs around Australia across

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.820
Caption: Southeast Asia in the US and the UK for

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.100
Caption: companies like Apple and IBM and the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.750
Caption: Commonwealth Bank the last 10 or 15

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.150
Caption: years I&#39;ve been focusing on innovation

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.039
Caption: working a lot with startups myself had

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:55.470
Caption: done some accelerators and now I mentor

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:57.268
Caption: and coaching accelerators I focus on the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.339
Caption: Lean Startup approach with customer

00:03:57.268 --> 00:04:01.018
Caption: development and I run the lean startup

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:04.050
Caption: Perth meetup if you&#39;re interested in in

00:04:01.018 --> 00:04:05.550
Caption: doing startups my ventures myself I&#39;ve

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.110
Caption: been involved with three major one my

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.150
Caption: current one is innovate Li which

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.430
Caption: basically provides consulting services

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:14.369
Caption: around this lean startup with customer

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:15.750
Caption: development innovation also I had a

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:18.359
Caption: software development company and I

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.250
Caption: focused on event-driven micro services

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.619
Caption: and CQRS I&#39;ve spoken about that

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.329
Caption: previously at this conference and cloud

00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:26.669
Caption: and I have a startup on my own which is

00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:28.199
Caption: in higher education space try to change

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.510
Caption: the way higher education works

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.309
Caption: it&#39;s called eco Vista but it&#39;s are still

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.520
Caption: very early stage

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:37.980
Caption: so enough about me let&#39;s thank our

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:39.599
Caption: sponsors here our amazing sponsors of

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.370
Caption: course we couldn&#39;t do this conference

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.020
Caption: with our sponsors they&#39;re the ones who

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:45.269
Caption: provide all the money to let you guys

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:47.220
Caption: come along and it&#39;s great to see met so

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:49.829
Caption: many local companies here supporting the

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.089
Caption: conference it&#39;s wonderful a wide array

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:56.879
Caption: of sponsors there so thanks to them

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:58.440
Caption: alright so we jump on this so we&#39;re

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.899
Caption: gonna start now we&#39;re gonna go down and

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.239
Caption: the Allison Wonder and wishing we all

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:03.809
Caption: sort of thing and hopefully we&#39;ll be

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:06.690
Caption: okay

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:08.399
Caption: but stick with me we&#39;re going to talk

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.440
Caption: now about quantum mechanics or quantum

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:12.809
Caption: physics who did some quantum physics in

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.970
Caption: their high school or university a few

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:16.649
Caption: people that&#39;s good for the others who

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.869
Caption: might seem quite strange but just try

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:20.609
Caption: and follow the reason that does seem a

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:22.739
Caption: bit strange is that we all live in the

00:05:20.609 --> 00:05:24.179
Caption: classical world we live in their world

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:26.699
Caption: of you know our meters and kilometers

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:29.039
Caption: and normal gravity and so forth and big

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.809
Caption: massive objects like ourselves do you

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.160
Caption: throw a ball and it goes straight and it

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:34.769
Caption: drops to the growth from the gravity and

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.360
Caption: so forth this is the world we live in

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:39.089
Caption: the classical world this is the way we

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:40.759
Caption: understand things but quantum mechanics

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:43.529
Caption: is very different it&#39;s about the

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.210
Caption: microscopic or the atomic size world and

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:47.010
Caption: there&#39;s no reason there has to behave

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:51.539
Caption: the same as our world and we&#39;ll see in

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:54.089
Caption: fact it does behave very differently so

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.950
Caption: this is a quantum physics and the first

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:58.679
Caption: experiment which demonstrated quantum

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:01.050
Caption: physics basically there was an electron

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:03.989
Caption: gun and it would fire electron guns a

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:06.149
Caption: little wall there which had two slits in

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:08.160
Caption: it then we have a sensor on the side of

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.869
Caption: the wall and of course when you fire

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.600
Caption: some of the electrons some went through

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:14.639
Caption: the holes and made a mark on the sensor

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.309
Caption: and some of them bounced off the wall

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.800
Caption: and didn&#39;t go through the holes so what

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:22.410
Caption: people expected was if you look did this

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:24.899
Caption: experiment with single electrons after

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.789
Caption: why you&#39;d get a pattern like this to

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:29.399
Caption: areas where the electrons were all going

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.079
Caption: through but that was surprised when they

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:32.940
Caption: did this experiment that what they

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:36.478
Caption: actually saw was something very

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.100
Caption: different it was like this and this is

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.140
Caption: basically a classic thing we see a lot

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.070
Caption: of times it&#39;s an interference pattern

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.780
Caption: made by waves the troughs and then there

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.119
Caption: the peaks of the waves where

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:50.700
Caption: get cancellation and superposition of

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:52.709
Caption: the values so this was a strong theme to

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.570
Caption: indicate that these electrons weren&#39;t

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:56.759
Caption: behaving like particles and just going

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.820
Caption: through the slits but in fact they were

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:03.000
Caption: behaving like waves so the electron wave

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.160
Caption: came here to separate parts went through

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.049
Caption: the actual slits and then those two

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.809
Caption: separate waves were interfering and

00:07:07.049 --> 00:07:11.519
Caption: causing the pattern but remember the

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:13.769
Caption: pattern over there isn&#39;t like some

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:16.109
Caption: painting on the wall is statistically

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:18.720
Caption: where the particles will go it&#39;s a

00:07:16.109 --> 00:07:20.909
Caption: probability distribution so these waves

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.829
Caption: aren&#39;t like water waves or air waves

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.320
Caption: they&#39;re wave describing the distribution

00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:28.168
Caption: of probabilities associated with this

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.730
Caption: electron now this is quite amazing to

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:32.279
Caption: think that electron is behaving like a

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.290
Caption: wave and this was the start of quantum

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:37.410
Caption: physics the things we learned from this

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.880
Caption: was the electron goes through both slits

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.130
Caption: at the same time

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.559
Caption: that&#39;s pretty freakish we don&#39;t see that

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:46.320
Caption: in the real world and the electrons are

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:48.179
Caption: both particles and waves again that&#39;s a

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.890
Caption: bit strange we see ways and we see

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:51.989
Caption: particles we don&#39;t see both things and

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.340
Caption: all the people say that can&#39;t be true

00:07:51.989 --> 00:07:54.989
Caption: you know something&#39;s wrong maybe there&#39;s

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:56.669
Caption: two electrons are doing things but

00:07:54.989 --> 00:07:58.199
Caption: remember is sending one electron through

00:07:56.669 --> 00:07:59.399
Caption: at a time it&#39;s not going through

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.010
Caption: interfering with other electrons it&#39;s

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:03.750
Caption: one at a time so people said oh yeah

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:06.210
Caption: what happens if we get a detector there

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:08.609
Caption: and we do try and detect the electron

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:09.929
Caption: which one it&#39;s really going through but

00:08:08.609 --> 00:08:11.579
Caption: luckily all it&#39;s strange that they found

00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:13.979
Caption: that when they did that they put a

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:15.959
Caption: detector there they actually detected

00:08:13.979 --> 00:08:19.200
Caption: the electron suddenly that pattern

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:21.660
Caption: changed back to this one and why is that

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.360
Caption: happened well you have these waves this

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:27.029
Caption: probability wave but when the electron

00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:30.239
Caption: interacts with the detector or a

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:32.010
Caption: macroscopic system a big system it

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:33.750
Caption: actually collapses into the one of the

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:36.718
Caption: classical things becomes more like a

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.338
Caption: classical electron like a particle so

00:08:36.718 --> 00:08:39.750
Caption: when you put the detector there it

00:08:38.338 --> 00:08:42.468
Caption: behaves like a particle when you take

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:46.010
Caption: the detector away it behaves like a wave

00:08:42.468 --> 00:08:48.570
Caption: strange things this is quantum physics

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.910
Caption: so the point here is in quantum physics

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.850
Caption: we have a concept of coherence and decay

00:08:50.909 --> 00:08:55.139
Caption: and decoherence coherence happens when

00:08:53.849 --> 00:08:57.329
Caption: the electrons on its own and not

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.570
Caption: interacting with the environment so it&#39;s

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.519
Caption: doing all the wavy type stuff

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.559
Caption: decoherence is when it interacts with

00:09:01.518 --> 00:09:05.599
Caption: the environment and the wavefunction

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:08.690
Caption: collapses and it now works like a bahut

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:11.448
Caption: particle that&#39;s wavefunction collapse so

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:13.070
Caption: when it&#39;s fully isolated the electron

00:09:11.448 --> 00:09:16.458
Caption: behaves like a wave it&#39;s said to be in a

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:17.419
Caption: coherent quantum wave state when it

00:09:16.458 --> 00:09:19.250
Caption: actually interacts with the

00:09:17.419 --> 00:09:22.969
Caption: macro-environment then it collapses and

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:24.679
Caption: becomes a classical state so this is the

00:09:22.969 --> 00:09:25.969
Caption: details of Cuauhtemoc actually to worry

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:27.948
Caption: about these equations which is a

00:09:25.969 --> 00:09:30.229
Caption: Schrodinger equation these are the guys

00:09:27.948 --> 00:09:33.528
Caption: who invented quantum mechanics nearly a

00:09:30.229 --> 00:09:35.179
Caption: hundred years ago now and the solution

00:09:33.528 --> 00:09:37.219
Caption: of this equation is that wave that

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:39.109
Caption: probability wave I was talking about

00:09:37.219 --> 00:09:41.328
Caption: which describes where the electrons will

00:09:39.109 --> 00:09:43.638
Caption: go with what probabilities that&#39;s very

00:09:41.328 --> 00:09:45.799
Caption: important quantum physics isn&#39;t

00:09:43.638 --> 00:09:48.229
Caption: deterministic like classical physics

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:50.508
Caption: it&#39;s probabilistic and that&#39;s a very

00:09:48.229 --> 00:09:52.729
Caption: different so let&#39;s explain this look and

00:09:50.508 --> 00:09:55.309
Caption: look at two or three of these concepts

00:09:52.729 --> 00:09:57.799
Caption: the first one is quantum superposition

00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:59.989
Caption: so here we have an electron and this

00:09:57.799 --> 00:10:02.028
Caption: electron has a charge and has a spin and

00:09:59.989 --> 00:10:04.760
Caption: it causes the magnetic field and that

00:10:02.028 --> 00:10:06.708
Caption: magnetic field can be up or down so we

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:10.639
Caption: can say these electron can be in two

00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:12.708
Caption: states the up state or the down state it

00:10:10.638 --> 00:10:16.759
Caption: can&#39;t be halfway it&#39;s either up or down

00:10:12.708 --> 00:10:19.039
Caption: and we can actually see this is not two

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:22.609
Caption: different electrons this is one electron

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:23.328
Caption: in both the up and the down state at the

00:10:22.609 --> 00:10:25.099
Caption: same time

00:10:23.328 --> 00:10:27.440
Caption: that&#39;s what superposition means you&#39;re

00:10:25.099 --> 00:10:29.539
Caption: in both states at the same time like the

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.819
Caption: electron was going through both switz at

00:10:29.539 --> 00:10:34.219
Caption: the same time so don&#39;t think it&#39;s

00:10:31.818 --> 00:10:37.068
Caption: separate the way we described this wave

00:10:34.219 --> 00:10:39.229
Caption: function here is we say it&#39;s combined of

00:10:37.068 --> 00:10:42.138
Caption: some of the uppers and some of the

00:10:39.229 --> 00:10:43.938
Caption: Downers and this weight here is used to

00:10:42.138 --> 00:10:45.948
Caption: calculate the probabilities that you

00:10:43.939 --> 00:10:47.809
Caption: when you measure this electron would you

00:10:45.948 --> 00:10:49.849
Caption: find it in the Upstate or would you find

00:10:47.809 --> 00:10:52.068
Caption: it in the downstate and this one here is

00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:54.078
Caption: balanced so it&#39;s 1/2 1/2 if you measure

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:57.708
Caption: it you&#39;d see half the time it&#39;s up and

00:10:54.078 --> 00:10:59.719
Caption: half the time is down but of course

00:10:57.708 --> 00:11:03.588
Caption: again it&#39;s just one electron in both

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:06.169
Caption: those states at the same time now that

00:11:03.588 --> 00:11:07.669
Caption: it has to be equal these electrons have

00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:10.068
Caption: different this electron has different

00:11:07.669 --> 00:11:12.768
Caption: weightings so it&#39;s more likely to be in

00:11:10.068 --> 00:11:12.959
Caption: the up state than in the down state so

00:11:12.768 --> 00:11:14.399
Caption: when

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:19.290
Caption: you measure it you&#39;re more likely to get

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:20.760
Caption: up then you would get down so there&#39;s a

00:11:19.289 --> 00:11:23.190
Caption: famous experiment you may have heard of

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.140
Caption: Schrodinger&#39;s cat where Schrodinger&#39;s

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.929
Caption: said this is absurd you can&#39;t be in both

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:30.150
Caption: states at once if we put a cat inside a

00:11:27.929 --> 00:11:33.119
Caption: box and we had a radioactive particle

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:35.640
Caption: here if that radioactive particle

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:37.890
Caption: decayed it would cause the hammer to

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.980
Caption: crash the bottle of cyanide here and

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:42.900
Caption: kill the cat if it didn&#39;t decay then it

00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:44.609
Caption: wouldn&#39;t kill the cat and Schrodinger

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.500
Caption: said well it&#39;s absurd so you&#39;re saying

00:11:44.609 --> 00:11:50.130
Caption: to me when I can&#39;t see inside this box

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:52.530
Caption: the cat is both dead and alive can&#39;t be

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.450
Caption: that&#39;s ridiculous and in fact it is

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.220
Caption: pretty ridiculous if you learned high

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:58.290
Caption: school quantum physics or university

00:11:56.219 --> 00:12:00.899
Caption: they probably told you that until you

00:11:58.289 --> 00:12:02.789
Caption: observed that cat it is either in 100

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.710
Caption: other states but our current

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:06.809
Caption: understanding of quantum physics is that

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:09.540
Caption: when that charge when that lect

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:12.479
Caption: radioactive particle interacts with the

00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:14.940
Caption: macroscopic system the hammer or the

00:12:12.479 --> 00:12:17.250
Caption: device here then actually will collapse

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.260
Caption: into one of the states so the cat will

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:22.080
Caption: actually be dead or alive in this

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:24.419
Caption: circumstance macro systems don&#39;t operate

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.040
Caption: like quantum systems only the particle

00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:31.219
Caption: inside here operates like a quantum

00:12:26.039 --> 00:12:33.389
Caption: system and that&#39;s important too okay

00:12:31.219 --> 00:12:34.979
Caption: separate thing to look at here is called

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.750
Caption: quantum entanglement and we&#39;ll talk

00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:39.750
Caption: about this later on - it&#39;s important for

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:42.030
Caption: quantum computing think now we have two

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:45.390
Caption: electrons here both of them can be in

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:47.370
Caption: the up or the down state if we made them

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:50.720
Caption: in a way that they had a wavefunction

00:12:47.369 --> 00:12:54.089
Caption: which only contains two possible States

00:12:50.719 --> 00:12:55.739
Caption: both down and both up and we can

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.350
Caption: construct these electrons into this

00:12:55.739 --> 00:13:00.959
Caption: particular wavefunction

00:12:57.349 --> 00:13:03.539
Caption: alright so it&#39;s this much both down and

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.670
Caption: this much both up or the other way

00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:08.729
Caption: around now what would happen if we

00:13:05.669 --> 00:13:11.820
Caption: separate these and we do a measurement

00:13:08.729 --> 00:13:15.119
Caption: we interact with this one to find out

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:17.520
Caption: whether it&#39;s up or down if we found out

00:13:15.119 --> 00:13:24.029
Caption: this one was down what do you think this

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:26.760
Caption: one has to be any ideas no because the

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:29.850
Caption: state here is down down or

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:32.580
Caption: but if this one is down it has to be in

00:13:29.849 --> 00:13:34.919
Caption: the down state if we measure this one

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.900
Caption: and it&#39;s up because the wavefunction

00:13:34.919 --> 00:13:39.539
Caption: says it&#39;s only split between these two

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.400
Caption: things the other one has to be up so

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:44.820
Caption: there&#39;s a correlation between the states

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:47.100
Caption: because these two electrons are quantum

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.679
Caption: entangled their wave functions are

00:13:47.099 --> 00:13:52.349
Caption: depended upon each other this is pretty

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:54.479
Caption: strange they&#39;re joined together some way

00:13:52.349 --> 00:13:56.279
Caption: and people didn&#39;t believe this for a

00:13:54.479 --> 00:13:58.049
Caption: long time until they did experiments

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.390
Caption: inside the laboratory and proved this

00:13:58.049 --> 00:14:02.250
Caption: actually happens it&#39;s even quite

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.290
Caption: freakier because you can take an

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.809
Caption: electron on earth and the Chinese have

00:14:04.289 --> 00:14:09.179
Caption: done this and take that electron it

00:14:06.809 --> 00:14:12.570
Caption: tangle with Undine here and put one on a

00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:14.359
Caption: satellite when you measure the electron

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:17.309
Caption: down here to find out is it up or down

00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:20.549
Caption: suddenly the one up here is up or down -

00:14:17.309 --> 00:14:23.250
Caption: they&#39;re correlated and in fact this is

00:14:20.549 --> 00:14:25.109
Caption: actually instantaneous there&#39;s no

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:27.510
Caption: information taking time to travel

00:14:25.109 --> 00:14:30.119
Caption: between these two they&#39;re connected no

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:32.010
Caption: matter how far away they are now for us

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:34.250
Caption: who live on the world on the ground here

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.479
Caption: that seems pretty stupid because we are

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:38.150
Caption: used to things that interact with each

00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:40.949
Caption: other infecting each other you know

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:42.540
Caption: influence cause-and-effect but here&#39;s

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.489
Caption: something way away is getting affected

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:47.339
Caption: by something way down here

00:14:44.489 --> 00:14:49.020
Caption: quantum entanglement and this is proven

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.490
Caption: they&#39;ve done it on the the satellites

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.720
Caption: and it basically showed that they were

00:14:50.489 --> 00:14:56.159
Caption: entangled so two things they were seen

00:14:53.719 --> 00:14:58.349
Caption: Einstein called this the spooky action

00:14:56.159 --> 00:15:01.649
Caption: at a distance and it is pretty spooky

00:14:58.349 --> 00:15:05.429
Caption: that it actually happens it&#39;s real it&#39;s

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:07.650
Caption: the quantum world now a famous physicist

00:15:05.429 --> 00:15:10.679
Caption: here Roger Penrose he said quantum

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:11.700
Caption: mechanics makes absolutely no sense so

00:15:10.679 --> 00:15:13.380
Caption: if you don&#39;t understand this stuff

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.000
Caption: you&#39;re in good hands this guy had

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.039
Caption: quantum physicists he says it doesn&#39;t

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.299
Caption: make some sense either and the way the

00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:20.130
Caption: reason it doesn&#39;t make sense is you

00:15:18.299 --> 00:15:22.349
Caption: can&#39;t think of it understand it in terms

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:24.630
Caption: of our everyday physics our classical

00:15:22.349 --> 00:15:28.039
Caption: physics it&#39;s what happens in the quantum

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:30.359
Caption: world famous physicist Richard Feynman

00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:31.169
Caption: he said if you think you understand

00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:33.119
Caption: quantum mechanics

00:15:31.169 --> 00:15:35.750
Caption: you don&#39;t understand quantum mechanics

00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:38.219
Caption: it&#39;s that complex and strange right and

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.809
Caption: he actually when he said this a year

00:15:38.219 --> 00:15:40.649
Caption: later he went on to win the Nobel Prize

00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:43.169
Caption: for

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:45.960
Caption: research in quantum physics so he knows

00:15:43.169 --> 00:15:47.849
Caption: what he&#39;s talking about right so it&#39;s

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.980
Caption: hard to understand don&#39;t be worried and

00:15:47.849 --> 00:15:51.569
Caption: you may think well maybe it works like

00:15:49.979 --> 00:15:53.399
Caption: that but maybe we just examine a bit

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:56.160
Caption: more it&#39;ll work more like the classical

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:59.520
Caption: world but no this is how the world works

00:15:56.159 --> 00:16:01.949
Caption: at the quantum scale quantum physics is

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.900
Caption: the most accurate and the most tested

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:07.440
Caption: theory in the history of science

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:10.590
Caption: it&#39;s amazing quantum physics predicts

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.450
Caption: certain values of physical constants and

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:16.440
Caption: when you go and measure them in the real

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:19.350
Caption: world they&#39;re precise 211 212 413

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.960
Caption: decimal places precision plus or minus

00:16:19.349 --> 00:16:24.839
Caption: 28 at the end we don&#39;t have here any

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.790
Caption: other theories that are that accurate so

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.680
Caption: a lot of other quantum physicists when

00:16:26.789 --> 00:16:31.019
Caption: people start philosophizing about is the

00:16:28.679 --> 00:16:33.809
Caption: world really like this they just say

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:35.869
Caption: sharp and calculate because it gives you

00:16:33.809 --> 00:16:38.010
Caption: the right answers right this is what our

00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:39.809
Caption: classical computers are based on this is

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:42.330
Caption: what most of modern technology is based

00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:46.169
Caption: on it just works quantum mechanics is

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:48.450
Caption: the reality at the quantum level so

00:16:46.169 --> 00:16:49.829
Caption: that&#39;s pretty strange stuff and you may

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.500
Caption: be having an exploiting head at the

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:54.570
Caption: moment bit hard to understand that but

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:57.030
Caption: just think about it we have superstition

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.590
Caption: of states and we have entanglement we&#39;re

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:02.540
Caption: going to try and build some computers

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:05.700
Caption: based upon these two physical properties

00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:08.040
Caption: so quantum computing what&#39;s that about

00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:10.649
Caption: well as I mentioned classical computers

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.989
Caption: focus on building systems based upon

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:15.150
Caption: classical physics or abstracting away

00:17:12.989 --> 00:17:17.189
Caption: from the quantum physics getting rid of

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.739
Caption: the noise and hiding that stuff you know

00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:20.609
Caption: now we have a lot of problems with

00:17:18.739 --> 00:17:21.839
Caption: classical computers because we&#39;re

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:24.059
Caption: getting down to the level where these

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:25.949
Caption: quantum effects start to happen we don&#39;t

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.170
Caption: want that happen so we&#39;re limited we try

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:30.809
Caption: and stay classical but we want to try

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:33.720
Caption: and build computers which benefit from

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:35.310
Caption: these quantum physics and when we&#39;re

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:37.169
Caption: talking about quantum computers we don&#39;t

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:39.480
Caption: talk about normal bits we talk about

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:42.420
Caption: quantum bits or they&#39;re often called

00:17:39.479 --> 00:17:45.709
Caption: qubits for short and these are a core

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:48.780
Caption: part of the quantum computing approach

00:17:45.709 --> 00:17:51.719
Caption: so let&#39;s try and compare classical bits

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:53.890
Caption: with quantum bits so here we have a one

00:17:51.719 --> 00:17:57.459
Caption: classical bit as you know it

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:59.410
Caption: be a 0 or a 1 there are two states and

00:17:57.459 --> 00:18:02.399
Caption: it can be in one of those states at a

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:04.450
Caption: time it&#39;s either zero or it&#39;s one

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.320
Caption: quantum beats as we know are different

00:18:04.449 --> 00:18:09.849
Caption: this is that quantum superposition a

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:13.419
Caption: quantum bit can be in both the state

00:18:09.849 --> 00:18:17.169
Caption: zero and one at the same time now it&#39;s

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:19.030
Caption: not 0.5 or 0.6 it&#39;s the two states but

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:23.050
Caption: it&#39;s a mixture of those states at the

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:24.700
Caption: same time right radical if we keep on

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:26.710
Caption: doing this of course in classical

00:18:24.699 --> 00:18:28.989
Caption: computers we have two bits we have four

00:18:26.709 --> 00:18:31.899
Caption: states that we&#39;re still in one of those

00:18:28.989 --> 00:18:35.410
Caption: four states quantum computers that we

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:37.420
Caption: have two qubits we have four states but

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.250
Caption: we&#39;re in all of those four states at

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.380
Caption: once if we decide to be in all of those

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:44.410
Caption: four states and we can keep on going

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:47.349
Caption: three bits eight states in one of those

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:50.020
Caption: states the quantum one three bits in

00:18:47.349 --> 00:18:50.910
Caption: eight states at the same time now it

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:56.140
Caption: gets interesting

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:58.900
Caption: think about n bits n classical bits 16

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:01.630
Caption: 32 a hundred you can have lots of

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:04.770
Caption: possible states but you&#39;re still only in

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:07.540
Caption: one of those states at a particular time

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:10.900
Caption: this is where it gets interesting for a

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:14.410
Caption: quantum system if you have n bits you&#39;re

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:16.420
Caption: in 2 to the N States at the same time

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:17.770
Caption: and there&#39;s a distribution about how

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.480
Caption: much of each state you&#39;re in

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.859
Caption: maybe this state or in some more in this

00:19:19.479 --> 00:19:23.829
Caption: state or in less and this state you&#39;re

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:26.500
Caption: in more quantum states quantum bits are

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:29.169
Caption: very different to show you how this is

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:33.069
Caption: important think about 300 quantum bits

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:36.130
Caption: not too big a number 300 if you had 300

00:19:33.069 --> 00:19:38.380
Caption: quantum bits then you have 2 to the 300

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:40.030
Caption: states that you&#39;re in and that&#39;s more

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:43.839
Caption: States than there are atoms in the

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:46.479
Caption: universe so a lot of states in 300

00:19:43.839 --> 00:19:48.489
Caption: quantum bits and if we can use that for

00:19:46.479 --> 00:19:52.059
Caption: doing some sort of processing we can do

00:19:48.489 --> 00:19:54.069
Caption: amazing stuff so the approaches to

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:56.080
Caption: quantum computing there&#39;s two approaches

00:19:54.069 --> 00:19:59.979
Caption: we&#39;re pretty early stage till what I

00:19:56.079 --> 00:20:02.199
Caption: call classical I&#39;m sorry digital quantum

00:19:59.979 --> 00:20:04.390
Caption: computing it&#39;s analogous to the digital

00:20:02.199 --> 00:20:07.209
Caption: classical computing and what I called

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.839
Caption: analog quantum computing it&#39;s analogous

00:20:07.209 --> 00:20:11.020
Caption: to the

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:12.819
Caption: analogue classical computing and this

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.229
Caption: approach the first one will focus on

00:20:12.819 --> 00:20:16.028
Caption: mostly and it&#39;s similar to the

00:20:14.229 --> 00:20:18.908
Caption: traditional approach we process these

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:21.250
Caption: bits but in different ways the second

00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:23.200
Caption: approach we use the analog computer to

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.969
Caption: simulate quantum systems who it turns

00:20:23.199 --> 00:20:26.528
Caption: out simulating quantum system is

00:20:24.969 --> 00:20:27.969
Caption: actually quite hard to do on a classical

00:20:26.529 --> 00:20:31.720
Caption: computer we want to do that to

00:20:27.969 --> 00:20:34.239
Caption: understand quantum world so let&#39;s have a

00:20:31.719 --> 00:20:36.489
Caption: look at the gates or the processes or

00:20:34.239 --> 00:20:39.849
Caption: the operations we have in a quantum

00:20:36.489 --> 00:20:42.428
Caption: system these gates like we have logic

00:20:39.849 --> 00:20:45.158
Caption: gates in a classical system these apply

00:20:42.428 --> 00:20:48.069
Caption: to the qubits so we apply an operation

00:20:45.159 --> 00:20:50.830
Caption: to the qubit so we have gates like the X

00:20:48.069 --> 00:20:53.168
Caption: gate which is similar to a knot we have

00:20:50.829 --> 00:20:55.538
Caption: Toffoli gate like an end we have a

00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:57.519
Caption: number of different operations here that

00:20:55.538 --> 00:21:00.308
Caption: it can apply to one or more of these

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:04.390
Caption: quantum bits it actually turns out that

00:21:00.308 --> 00:21:06.939
Caption: these three operations here equivalent

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:09.190
Caption: to classical computing they make the

00:21:06.939 --> 00:21:11.528
Caption: quantum computing a universal computer

00:21:09.189 --> 00:21:13.209
Caption: just like a classical computer so

00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:14.799
Caption: anything we can do in a quantum in a

00:21:13.209 --> 00:21:16.359
Caption: classical computer we can do in a

00:21:14.798 --> 00:21:17.769
Caption: quantum computer but we probably won&#39;t

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:19.989
Caption: want to you will probably focus on the

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:21.339
Caption: things that does differently we&#39;re going

00:21:19.989 --> 00:21:23.469
Caption: to the details of these but they&#39;re just

00:21:21.339 --> 00:21:26.250
Caption: different operations apply to these

00:21:23.469 --> 00:21:29.199
Caption: quantum bits which are in many states

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.548
Caption: well what about the processing in a

00:21:29.199 --> 00:21:33.639
Caption: quantum computer what does it progress

00:21:30.548 --> 00:21:34.989
Caption: like well we have this dry diagram here

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.109
Caption: which explains things these are our

00:21:34.989 --> 00:21:39.459
Caption: quantum bits down here and across here

00:21:38.109 --> 00:21:42.428
Caption: we can see we&#39;re applying different

00:21:39.459 --> 00:21:44.558
Caption: operations we apply the H or Hadamard

00:21:42.428 --> 00:21:46.630
Caption: operation here then weep reply this

00:21:44.558 --> 00:21:48.308
Caption: operation here between these two bits

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.229
Caption: another operation here and then this one

00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:52.630
Caption: in this one shows here we&#39;re measuring

00:21:50.229 --> 00:21:54.158
Caption: the quantum bits we&#39;re interacting with

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:57.159
Caption: them to find out what their state is

00:21:54.159 --> 00:21:58.419
Caption: that causes some quantum wavefunction

00:21:57.159 --> 00:22:00.580
Caption: collapse but we can keep on going

00:21:58.418 --> 00:22:03.579
Caption: because not all the system is collapsed

00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:06.729
Caption: so this is how we describe processing in

00:22:03.579 --> 00:22:08.469
Caption: a quantum computer but be careful here

00:22:06.729 --> 00:22:10.178
Caption: don&#39;t think this is like the electrons

00:22:08.469 --> 00:22:12.969
Caption: are flowing through here and these are

00:22:10.178 --> 00:22:14.619
Caption: gates the quantum bits actually stay

00:22:12.969 --> 00:22:17.349
Caption: where they are we just apply these

00:22:14.619 --> 00:22:19.270
Caption: operations to them so this diagram is

00:22:17.349 --> 00:22:21.520
Caption: really showing you what happens over

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:23.320
Caption: time to these quantum bits

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.080
Caption: do these first we do these and we do

00:22:23.319 --> 00:22:28.500
Caption: these and so on so this is the

00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:30.549
Caption: processing we do two quantum bits

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.859
Caption: there&#39;s some problems with quantum

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:35.350
Caption: computers they tend to these bits these

00:22:32.859 --> 00:22:37.599
Caption: quantum bits tend to decohere over time

00:22:35.349 --> 00:22:39.910
Caption: they lose their coherence they&#39;re

00:22:37.599 --> 00:22:43.359
Caption: quantumness and I become more classical

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:46.630
Caption: and this introduces Aaron&#39;s high error

00:22:43.359 --> 00:22:49.119
Caption: rates as a lieu they interact with the

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:52.089
Caption: environment any interactions noise sound

00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:54.489
Caption: thermal interactions so to make reliable

00:22:52.089 --> 00:22:56.650
Caption: quantum computing we have to get some

00:22:54.489 --> 00:22:58.300
Caption: sort of quantum error correction just

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:00.820
Caption: like we quantum we error correct some of

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:02.860
Caption: our ram now you can do the same thing

00:23:00.819 --> 00:23:04.630
Caption: for quantum memory and in fact this has

00:23:02.859 --> 00:23:06.729
Caption: already been done a guy&#39;s already

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.469
Caption: written the algorithm the good news is

00:23:06.729 --> 00:23:10.540
Caption: the algorithm to do quantum error

00:23:08.469 --> 00:23:12.819
Caption: correction to make sure our quantum bits

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.979
Caption: are reliable we need them to be reliable

00:23:12.819 --> 00:23:17.319
Caption: that&#39;s the good news the bad news is

00:23:14.979 --> 00:23:19.719
Caption: that to make one quantum bit reliable

00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:22.209
Caption: you need about a thousand extra quantum

00:23:19.719 --> 00:23:26.079
Caption: bits to provide redundancy and make sure

00:23:22.209 --> 00:23:28.329
Caption: it&#39;s reliable that&#39;s quite large what

00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:30.939
Caption: about what can these quantum computers

00:23:28.329 --> 00:23:31.779
Caption: compute if you know about the P NP

00:23:30.939 --> 00:23:33.729
Caption: problem

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:36.520
Caption: the polynomial time problems and the non

00:23:33.729 --> 00:23:37.959
Caption: polynomial time problems we in quantum

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.180
Caption: computing we introduce a new thing

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:42.699
Caption: called the bounded error quantum

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.140
Caption: polynomial time calculations these are

00:23:42.699 --> 00:23:46.419
Caption: the things you can calculate with the

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:49.150
Caption: quantum computer we don&#39;t know for sure

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.380
Caption: but we know at least that quantum

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.940
Caption: computer can do everything that a

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:55.510
Caption: classical computer can do in polynomial

00:23:51.939 --> 00:23:57.789
Caption: time we think possibly that B Q P is

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:59.800
Caption: greater than P we can do things more

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:02.619
Caption: practically more efficiently in quantum

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:04.570
Caption: computers but that may just be because

00:24:02.619 --> 00:24:06.550
Caption: we haven&#39;t found the right algorithm for

00:24:04.569 --> 00:24:08.349
Caption: our classical computers but I tend to

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:10.980
Caption: think it&#39;s extra there in the quantum

00:24:08.349 --> 00:24:12.880
Caption: computer so maybe we are greater than P

00:24:10.979 --> 00:24:14.949
Caption: but don&#39;t think that quantum computers

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.869
Caption: are going to solve all our NP problems

00:24:14.949 --> 00:24:18.609
Caption: there no silver bullet for that it

00:24:16.869 --> 00:24:20.559
Caption: doesn&#39;t give us a magic solution to

00:24:18.609 --> 00:24:23.049
Caption: solve exponential problems immediately

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:28.030
Caption: but it will help us solve some problems

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:29.980
Caption: faster so that&#39;s pretty good news maybe

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:31.420
Caption: your heads still uploading exploiting

00:24:29.979 --> 00:24:33.520
Caption: but hope you&#39;re following here the idea

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.900
Caption: of a quantum computer the quantum

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.820
Caption: mechanics and using the

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:40.260
Caption: with quantum bits and doing processing

00:24:36.819 --> 00:24:43.959
Caption: are you following me okay

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:46.599
Caption: hope so let&#39;s have a look what&#39;s the

00:24:43.959 --> 00:24:48.189
Caption: next thing so let&#39;s look at this

00:24:46.599 --> 00:24:49.989
Caption: physical path now the quantum computer

00:24:48.189 --> 00:24:52.059
Caption: itself what does it look like and how

00:24:49.989 --> 00:24:54.250
Caption: does it work as I mentioned there were

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:56.530
Caption: two types of quantum computers the

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:58.839
Caption: digital ones and the analogue ones we&#39;ll

00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:00.729
Caption: focus on the digital ones and the way

00:24:58.839 --> 00:25:04.630
Caption: they currently work is there&#39;s two

00:25:00.729 --> 00:25:06.280
Caption: approaches one is called iron traps they

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:08.140
Caption: take an atom to get rid of some

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.450
Caption: electrons so now it&#39;s positively charged

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.790
Caption: and they use that positive charge to

00:25:10.449 --> 00:25:14.349
Caption: trap it in electric field so they can

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.359
Caption: isolate it from everything else they can

00:25:14.349 --> 00:25:19.719
Caption: cool it down and now they can use its

00:25:16.359 --> 00:25:21.540
Caption: quantum states to build qubits the other

00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:23.829
Caption: approach which is very common is

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:26.109
Caption: supercomputing circuits they have a

00:25:23.829 --> 00:25:29.109
Caption: little silicon circuit but they cool it

00:25:26.109 --> 00:25:31.750
Caption: down to nearly absolute zero and now it

00:25:29.109 --> 00:25:33.609
Caption: becomes a superconducting circuit so now

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.469
Caption: actually shows some quantum properties

00:25:33.609 --> 00:25:39.309
Caption: and you can use those quantum properties

00:25:35.469 --> 00:25:41.709
Caption: to build your quantum bits the other one

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:44.440
Caption: uses supercomputing circuits as well

00:25:41.709 --> 00:25:47.439
Caption: this is an example of a quantum computer

00:25:44.439 --> 00:25:49.329
Caption: chip as you can see here it&#39;s pretty

00:25:47.439 --> 00:25:50.979
Caption: clear these are the actual qubits you

00:25:49.329 --> 00:25:53.559
Caption: see a little bit&#39;s there so basically I

00:25:50.979 --> 00:25:54.729
Caption: think it&#39;s 16 qubits on this one they&#39;re

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.380
Caption: little loops where you can get

00:25:54.729 --> 00:25:58.929
Caption: superconducting things happening when

00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:01.510
Caption: it&#39;s cooled down to really close to

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:03.610
Caption: absolute zero in fact it&#39;s only it&#39;s a

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:06.910
Caption: couple of order of magnitudes colder

00:26:03.609 --> 00:26:09.489
Caption: than outer space milli kelvins very very

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:11.080
Caption: cold but you can also see here&#39;s some

00:26:09.489 --> 00:26:13.420
Caption: circuitry which actually produces

00:26:11.079 --> 00:26:15.789
Caption: electric fields to allow us to interact

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.830
Caption: those with those quantum bits to perform

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:20.770
Caption: the operations on them to change their

00:26:17.829 --> 00:26:22.750
Caption: quantum wave function so this is how a

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:25.810
Caption: new quantum computer chip looks

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:27.760
Caption: currently but of course that&#39;s just the

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:30.100
Caption: chip we have to put it inside some

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.680
Caption: infrastructure as I mentioned you need

00:26:30.099 --> 00:26:34.599
Caption: to keep these near absolute zero so we

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.640
Caption: need to have a cryo stat with many

00:26:34.599 --> 00:26:38.530
Caption: layers who can cool it down to get down

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.200
Caption: to this absolute zero temperature or

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:43.660
Caption: close to it we need to also isolate it

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:45.399
Caption: from any vibrations we need to also

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:48.669
Caption: isolate it from any electromagnetic

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:51.869
Caption: fields because if that quantum bit into

00:26:48.668 --> 00:26:54.428
Caption: with the outside world radiation or

00:26:51.869 --> 00:26:56.529
Caption: vibrations it&#39;ll become a classical

00:26:54.428 --> 00:26:58.778
Caption: thing again and it will lose its quantum

00:26:56.529 --> 00:26:59.080
Caption: state so we have to isolate it to keep

00:26:58.779 --> 00:27:01.749
Caption: it

00:26:59.079 --> 00:27:04.508
Caption: quantum so we cover this up in a

00:27:01.749 --> 00:27:06.909
Caption: cylinder and we make it into a cryostat

00:27:04.509 --> 00:27:09.039
Caption: here can be cooled down and now we have

00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:11.859
Caption: a whole world of electronics to actually

00:27:09.038 --> 00:27:13.498
Caption: control that chip to affect the chip to

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:16.089
Caption: make measurements to do transformations

00:27:13.499 --> 00:27:18.460
Caption: we have a whole lot of electronics a

00:27:16.089 --> 00:27:20.288
Caption: control processor layer to control this

00:27:18.459 --> 00:27:23.099
Caption: stuff and then we have traditional

00:27:20.288 --> 00:27:26.018
Caption: computers which actually program these

00:27:23.099 --> 00:27:27.668
Caption: control systems so I think that&#39;s how

00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:29.710
Caption: you&#39;ll see quantum computers for a

00:27:27.668 --> 00:27:31.538
Caption: number of years going forth basically a

00:27:29.709 --> 00:27:33.609
Caption: classical computer controlling

00:27:31.538 --> 00:27:35.709
Caption: electronics which affect the quantum

00:27:33.609 --> 00:27:38.499
Caption: chip so we&#39;re still using classical

00:27:35.709 --> 00:27:39.428
Caption: computers to control this stuff now this

00:27:38.499 --> 00:27:41.710
Caption: looks pretty old

00:27:39.428 --> 00:27:43.329
Caption: this looks pretty bulky and air over and

00:27:41.709 --> 00:27:45.849
Caption: I&#39;m not very state-of-the-art sort of

00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:47.888
Caption: thing but this is our first attempt at

00:27:45.849 --> 00:27:49.749
Caption: quantum computers remember what our

00:27:47.889 --> 00:27:51.989
Caption: first attempt at classical computers

00:27:49.749 --> 00:27:55.869
Caption: look like this is Australia&#39;s first

00:27:51.989 --> 00:27:57.729
Caption: digital computer the Cyro built so we&#39;re

00:27:55.869 --> 00:28:00.669
Caption: at this stage currently with quantum

00:27:57.729 --> 00:28:02.259
Caption: computers we are a long way to go but

00:28:00.668 --> 00:28:06.368
Caption: even though we&#39;re some people these days

00:28:02.259 --> 00:28:08.559
Caption: some companies put a shiny box around

00:28:06.369 --> 00:28:11.919
Caption: their quantum computers and they sell

00:28:08.558 --> 00:28:15.128
Caption: them this company d-wave sells quantum

00:28:11.918 --> 00:28:17.798
Caption: computers which have 5000 qubits which

00:28:15.129 --> 00:28:19.809
Caption: sounds like a lot and it is but the

00:28:17.798 --> 00:28:22.359
Caption: problem is these qubits aren&#39;t very high

00:28:19.808 --> 00:28:24.069
Caption: quality they decohere very quickly and

00:28:22.359 --> 00:28:26.558
Caption: people don&#39;t believe much quantum stuff

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:28.508
Caption: happens they&#39;re still they can use them

00:28:26.558 --> 00:28:30.579
Caption: for certain calculations and for

00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:32.440
Caption: simulating quantum systems so you can

00:28:30.579 --> 00:28:36.038
Caption: buy one from ten to fifteen million

00:28:32.439 --> 00:28:39.969
Caption: dollars I believe IBM also build quantum

00:28:36.038 --> 00:28:42.189
Caption: computer that you can actually buy how

00:28:39.969 --> 00:28:44.439
Caption: do we program these things remember we

00:28:42.189 --> 00:28:46.599
Caption: program on a classical computer to

00:28:44.439 --> 00:28:49.058
Caption: control the electronics which control

00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:50.798
Caption: the chip and make it do things and a

00:28:49.058 --> 00:28:53.229
Caption: number of companies have libraries to

00:28:50.798 --> 00:28:55.988
Caption: help you control or process this quantum

00:28:53.229 --> 00:28:58.749
Caption: stuff Microsoft have a language called Q

00:28:55.989 --> 00:29:01.839
Caption: sharp basically it&#39;s a DSL to help you

00:28:58.749 --> 00:29:03.040
Caption: do quantum operations on qubits do

00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:05.380
Caption: have a look through this car it&#39;s not

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.900
Caption: easy know how to understand here

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.940
Caption: applying a/c not operation one of those

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.130
Caption: transformations were applying it to a

00:29:09.939 --> 00:29:14.739
Caption: particular qubit to get from here to

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:16.690
Caption: there let me provide a hey chopper ation

00:29:14.739 --> 00:29:19.719
Caption: on this one and down here we&#39;re doing a

00:29:16.689 --> 00:29:22.689
Caption: measurement of certain bits so adsl2

00:29:19.719 --> 00:29:25.419
Caption: control the electronics to transform the

00:29:22.689 --> 00:29:28.089
Caption: qubits inside the quantum computer and

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:30.130
Caption: that&#39;s how you program a quantum

00:29:28.089 --> 00:29:32.079
Caption: computer currently it&#39;s sort of like the

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:35.199
Caption: machine level programming of our old

00:29:32.079 --> 00:29:36.729
Caption: computers so there are issues of they

00:29:35.199 --> 00:29:38.529
Caption: mentioned with quantum computing and

00:29:36.729 --> 00:29:41.169
Caption: quantum computers there&#39;s a key

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:43.599
Caption: coherence problem that we lose coherence

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.460
Caption: we come out of the quantum state there&#39;s

00:29:43.599 --> 00:29:46.689
Caption: a difficulty with input and output who

00:29:45.459 --> 00:29:48.699
Caption: would have thought input or output would

00:29:46.689 --> 00:29:50.829
Caption: be difficult but as it&#39;s hard to get

00:29:48.699 --> 00:29:53.049
Caption: input into all these states to put the

00:29:50.829 --> 00:29:54.849
Caption: quantum electrons into certain wave

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:57.220
Caption: states and it&#39;s hard to get the

00:29:54.849 --> 00:29:59.140
Caption: information out because if you try and

00:29:57.219 --> 00:30:01.449
Caption: measure the state of the quantum bits

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:03.520
Caption: you make them classical again so you

00:30:01.449 --> 00:30:05.019
Caption: lose all your quantumness so you have to

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.390
Caption: do some tricky things to measure a

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:10.420
Caption: little bit but leave the system still

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:12.790
Caption: useful also I mentioned we have a short

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.560
Caption: time of decoherence so they&#39;re only last

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.570
Caption: in their quantum state for a short time

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.310
Caption: and how would you do bug one of these

00:30:16.569 --> 00:30:20.529
Caption: systems when you can&#39;t interact with it

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.980
Caption: you can&#39;t do printf or save to a log

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.680
Caption: file

00:30:20.979 --> 00:30:25.179
Caption: how do you do bug this sort of stuff but

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.680
Caption: the truth is here that all of this is

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.930
Caption: improving we get better at doing this

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:32.410
Caption: we&#39;re finding out ways how to do this to

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:34.150
Caption: program quantum programs in fact there

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:38.140
Caption: are some current records in quantum

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:41.650
Caption: computing the record for coherence time

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:44.890
Caption: keeping in that quantum state is 90

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:46.839
Caption: microseconds it&#39;s not very long other

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:49.270
Caption: systems get longer times but they&#39;re not

00:30:46.839 --> 00:30:52.479
Caption: really quantum systems like the d-wave

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:54.010
Caption: ones 90 microseconds is it very long but

00:30:52.479 --> 00:30:56.260
Caption: now we can show that we can actually

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:58.900
Caption: perform the operations on these qubits

00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.609
Caption: very fast a team of researchers at u.s.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:04.180
Caption: lwith showing they can do a qubit

00:31:00.609 --> 00:31:05.770
Caption: operation in 0.8 nanoseconds so that

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:08.320
Caption: gives us quite a bit of chance to do

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:10.839
Caption: operations before we decohere and lose

00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:13.299
Caption: the quantum state and the largest

00:31:10.839 --> 00:31:15.219
Caption: digital computer currently and I know of

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.890
Caption: is seventy-two qubits

00:31:15.219 --> 00:31:20.559
Caption: built by IBM the Bristlecone processor

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:23.920
Caption: and every year we get more and more so

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:27.370
Caption: it&#39;s basically growing every year that&#39;s

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:29.950
Caption: a quantum records there&#39;s a huge

00:31:27.369 --> 00:31:31.719
Caption: investment in quantum computing explain

00:31:29.949 --> 00:31:34.659
Caption: a bit why a bit later on but companies

00:31:31.719 --> 00:31:36.819
Caption: like IBM Microsoft and Google have large

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.590
Caption: research labs investing millions and

00:31:36.819 --> 00:31:40.149
Caption: millions of dollars to build quantum

00:31:38.589 --> 00:31:41.020
Caption: computers and to understand quantum

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.270
Caption: computing

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.979
Caption: similarly there are a number of startups

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:47.290
Caption: like d-wave and another one called

00:31:44.979 --> 00:31:49.270
Caption: Righetti and in fact the story is if you

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:50.590
Caption: go into any cafe in Silicon Valley and

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.880
Caption: start talking about quantum computing

00:31:50.589 --> 00:31:54.010
Caption: someone will write you a check for a

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.890
Caption: million dollars straightaway everyone&#39;s

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:58.959
Caption: investing in quantum computing and even

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:00.700
Caption: the government&#39;s you know the EU is one

00:31:58.959 --> 00:32:03.130
Caption: of the largest investors in quantum

00:32:00.699 --> 00:32:04.899
Caption: computing research similarly for the US

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:07.780
Caption: and China because they see it as the

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:11.229
Caption: next revolution in computing it&#39;s very

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:12.400
Caption: significant so you maybe still have

00:32:11.229 --> 00:32:13.689
Caption: exploding heads but now you were

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.479
Caption: enjoying it with your friends as your

00:32:13.689 --> 00:32:17.859
Caption: head explodes it&#39;s pretty radical stuff

00:32:16.479 --> 00:32:19.809
Caption: it&#39;s not what you&#39;d normally think about

00:32:17.859 --> 00:32:21.579
Caption: as computing or the way we do computing

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:23.620
Caption: but I want to show you in the last

00:32:21.579 --> 00:32:26.019
Caption: section here some applications of

00:32:23.619 --> 00:32:27.579
Caption: quantum computing you&#39;ll see why it&#39;s

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.310
Caption: really important in how it&#39;s really

00:32:27.579 --> 00:32:31.989
Caption: important because we&#39;re in an early

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:33.580
Caption: stage in quantum computing and we don&#39;t

00:32:31.989 --> 00:32:36.400
Caption: just want to copy all the things that

00:32:33.579 --> 00:32:38.049
Caption: classical digital computers do we tend

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.500
Caption: to find that quantum computers are

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:45.100
Caption: problem focused not automation focused

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:48.130
Caption: you don&#39;t build an ERP system or a CRM

00:32:45.099 --> 00:32:49.299
Caption: system or a banking system using quantum

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:51.670
Caption: computer so we can do that really well

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:54.369
Caption: on classical computers but there are

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.960
Caption: certain problems in classical computing

00:32:54.369 --> 00:32:58.180
Caption: in normal computing which we have

00:32:55.959 --> 00:33:00.699
Caption: trouble solving and quantum computers

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:02.740
Caption: can help us solve those let&#39;s look at

00:33:00.699 --> 00:33:05.769
Caption: those so there are four different types

00:33:02.739 --> 00:33:09.069
Caption: of problems that we can solve simulation

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:11.560
Caption: of quantum systems search factorization

00:33:09.069 --> 00:33:13.029
Caption: and optimization I&#39;d like to look at two

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.800
Caption: or three of these and explain them to

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:18.400
Caption: you to give you an idea of how it solves

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.840
Caption: these problems before we do that we

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.750
Caption: talked about the first one simulation

00:33:19.839 --> 00:33:25.539
Caption: he&#39;s another quote from a mr. Fineman he

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:27.699
Caption: said that nature isn&#39;t classical dammit

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:29.020
Caption: that&#39;s how he spoke and if you want to

00:33:27.699 --> 00:33:30.569
Caption: make a simulation of Nate

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:33.099
Caption: nature you&#39;d better make it

00:33:30.569 --> 00:33:34.299
Caption: quantum-mechanical and he was intrigued

00:33:33.099 --> 00:33:35.979
Caption: by the fact that this is a jolly good

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:39.280
Caption: problem to try and solve it&#39;s really

00:33:35.979 --> 00:33:41.549
Caption: hard and in the past it has been very

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.469
Caption: difficult if we wanted to simulate

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:47.320
Caption: electrons like electrons in a a molecule

00:33:44.469 --> 00:33:49.689
Caption: for chemistry to see how these electrons

00:33:47.319 --> 00:33:52.209
Caption: interact if we try and do that with a

00:33:49.689 --> 00:33:55.839
Caption: classical system it&#39;s very very

00:33:52.209 --> 00:33:58.299
Caption: difficult think if we had 40 electrons

00:33:55.839 --> 00:34:01.000
Caption: in our molecule and they could be in two

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:02.830
Caption: quantum states but remember they&#39;re in a

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.530
Caption: soup position of all those quantum

00:34:02.829 --> 00:34:07.989
Caption: states so you actually have two to the

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:10.060
Caption: forty states have to try and store in

00:34:07.989 --> 00:34:11.949
Caption: memory it actually it comes down to

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:15.189
Caption: about a hundred and thirty gigabytes of

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:18.668
Caption: memory you&#39;d need to store 40 electron

00:34:15.189 --> 00:34:20.079
Caption: states in a quantum wave that would be

00:34:18.668 --> 00:34:21.939
Caption: really tough but if you could imagine

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.820
Caption: you could get 130 gigabytes of memory

00:34:21.939 --> 00:34:28.178
Caption: maybe we can these days if you wanted to

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:30.940
Caption: add one extra electron 41 it&#39;s not just

00:34:28.178 --> 00:34:35.079
Caption: a little bit more it&#39;s two times more so

00:34:30.939 --> 00:34:36.908
Caption: now you need 260 gigabytes of memory so

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.700
Caption: the classical resources you need to

00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:41.469
Caption: solve quantum simulations go up

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:44.858
Caption: exponentially because the number of

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:47.590
Caption: states goes up exponentially so this is

00:34:44.858 --> 00:34:50.888
Caption: why quantum computers are really good

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:53.859
Caption: for simulating quantum systems if we

00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:56.319
Caption: have 40 bits we could simulate our 40

00:34:53.858 --> 00:34:58.739
Caption: electrons if you want to add in one more

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:02.560
Caption: electron we just add in one more bit and

00:34:58.739 --> 00:35:05.679
Caption: in fact quantum simulation using quantum

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:08.140
Caption: computers to model the behavior of

00:35:05.679 --> 00:35:10.809
Caption: chemicals and so forth is basically

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:12.669
Caption: making the chemists really happy they

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:15.640
Caption: now think they&#39;ve solved the problem of

00:35:12.669 --> 00:35:17.260
Caption: simulating an understanding matter no

00:35:15.639 --> 00:35:18.699
Caption: longer is it difficult to simulate we

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.080
Caption: can do it and understand it we can build

00:35:18.699 --> 00:35:22.060
Caption: whatever matter we like because we

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.880
Caption: understand the chemistry and how these

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:27.250
Caption: applications how these are molecules and

00:35:24.879 --> 00:35:29.709
Caption: atoms interact they think it will have

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:31.419
Caption: huge implications for the pharmaceutical

00:35:29.709 --> 00:35:33.189
Caption: industry a trillion dollar industry

00:35:31.419 --> 00:35:35.649
Caption: they&#39;re saying in using quantum

00:35:33.189 --> 00:35:38.020
Caption: computers to simulate atoms to build

00:35:35.649 --> 00:35:41.260
Caption: materials and the chemicals we need for

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:42.880
Caption: our pharmaceuticals quantum simulation

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:45.459
Caption: is not just a little bit

00:35:42.879 --> 00:35:47.858
Caption: faster it&#39;s thousands of times faster

00:35:45.459 --> 00:35:50.139
Caption: than classical computers trying to

00:35:47.858 --> 00:35:53.078
Caption: simulate a quantum system it&#39;s

00:35:50.139 --> 00:35:55.419
Caption: exponentially better that&#39;s huge

00:35:53.079 --> 00:35:56.920
Caption: exponentially better so the first thing

00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:59.769
Caption: that quantum computers do it can do is

00:35:56.919 --> 00:36:02.798
Caption: they can simulate quantum systems in the

00:35:59.769 --> 00:36:04.150
Caption: real world which is great the second

00:36:02.799 --> 00:36:07.239
Caption: thing to do which we can do with quantum

00:36:04.149 --> 00:36:09.429
Caption: computers is we can search now think

00:36:07.239 --> 00:36:11.739
Caption: about classical search if you had in a

00:36:09.429 --> 00:36:13.179
Caption: file with n numbers in it you wanted to

00:36:11.739 --> 00:36:16.239
Caption: search through and find one of those

00:36:13.179 --> 00:36:18.219
Caption: numbers it&#39;s an order of n problem

00:36:16.239 --> 00:36:20.199
Caption: classical search on average you have to

00:36:18.219 --> 00:36:23.588
Caption: find go through about n divided by two

00:36:20.199 --> 00:36:25.929
Caption: before you find the one you want with a

00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:27.579
Caption: quantum computer we can prove there&#39;s an

00:36:25.929 --> 00:36:29.909
Caption: algorithm which is proved we can do it

00:36:27.579 --> 00:36:33.250
Caption: in the order of square root of n and

00:36:29.909 --> 00:36:35.979
Caption: this is quite amazing it&#39;s quadratically

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:38.799
Caption: better if you think about it if we were

00:36:35.979 --> 00:36:41.588
Caption: trying to search 10 billion things to

00:36:38.799 --> 00:36:43.690
Caption: find a needle in a haystack in the

00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:46.930
Caption: classical computer that will require on

00:36:43.689 --> 00:36:49.719
Caption: the order of 10 billion operations quite

00:36:46.929 --> 00:36:51.608
Caption: a few with a quantum computer it&#39;s a

00:36:49.719 --> 00:36:55.529
Caption: square root of that just a hundred

00:36:51.608 --> 00:36:58.209
Caption: thousand so a lot faster to do search

00:36:55.529 --> 00:37:00.759
Caption: once one problem area that quantum

00:36:58.209 --> 00:37:02.739
Caption: computers can help in an example of this

00:37:00.759 --> 00:37:04.119
Caption: is the traveling salesperson problem you

00:37:02.739 --> 00:37:06.189
Caption: may thought about her this this is a

00:37:04.118 --> 00:37:07.959
Caption: problem where you have a salesperson or

00:37:06.189 --> 00:37:09.338
Caption: a tourist in this case who wants to

00:37:07.959 --> 00:37:11.379
Caption: visit a number of different sites

00:37:09.339 --> 00:37:13.630
Caption: he knows the distance between all of

00:37:11.379 --> 00:37:15.818
Caption: these sites which one should they go to

00:37:13.629 --> 00:37:17.558
Caption: in which order to see the most and

00:37:15.819 --> 00:37:20.200
Caption: travel the least distance it&#39;s a

00:37:17.559 --> 00:37:21.700
Caption: minimization type problem but really

00:37:20.199 --> 00:37:23.078
Caption: it&#39;s a search problem too because you

00:37:21.699 --> 00:37:25.209
Caption: could search through all the different

00:37:23.079 --> 00:37:28.869
Caption: possible routes and find the one which

00:37:25.209 --> 00:37:31.118
Caption: is the lowest and in fact this is an N

00:37:28.868 --> 00:37:33.788
Caption: factorial problem because your first

00:37:31.118 --> 00:37:35.528
Caption: choice is in your second choice is which

00:37:33.789 --> 00:37:37.900
Caption: want to go to n minus 1 and you keep on

00:37:35.529 --> 00:37:39.519
Caption: going in factorial you ever tried

00:37:37.899 --> 00:37:41.500
Caption: factorials when your calculator by the

00:37:39.519 --> 00:37:43.779
Caption: time you get to 110 you blow up your

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:47.319
Caption: calculator because factorials get very

00:37:43.779 --> 00:37:49.779
Caption: large very quickly but the nice thing is

00:37:47.319 --> 00:37:52.420
Caption: quantum can do this search in the order

00:37:49.779 --> 00:37:54.819
Caption: of square root of n so even though it&#39;s

00:37:52.419 --> 00:37:57.349
Caption: huge it can do it quite quickly it can

00:37:54.819 --> 00:37:59.870
Caption: solve this problem

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:02.030
Caption: and the way we do this is some guy named

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:04.730
Caption: Grover suggested that Grover&#39;s algorithm

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:06.380
Caption: how to do this and basically here is

00:38:04.729 --> 00:38:08.689
Caption: that diagram again showing you our

00:38:06.379 --> 00:38:11.119
Caption: quantum states or applying operations

00:38:08.689 --> 00:38:13.399
Caption: but these are like modules or functions

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.920
Caption: with a whole lot of operations inside so

00:38:13.399 --> 00:38:17.869
Caption: we do this particular step then we find

00:38:15.919 --> 00:38:19.879
Caption: a short route yes or no we do this step

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:21.470
Caption: and check for the short route and he

00:38:19.879 --> 00:38:23.539
Caption: described this operations and these

00:38:21.469 --> 00:38:25.429
Caption: things you do in detail some of them are

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:28.189
Caption: quite complex some of them are like

00:38:25.429 --> 00:38:30.050
Caption: quite classical to calculate the square

00:38:28.189 --> 00:38:31.699
Caption: root the shortest route that will the

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:33.890
Caption: length of the route you have to do some

00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:35.659
Caption: classical operations but remember

00:38:33.889 --> 00:38:37.669
Caption: quantum computers can do classical

00:38:35.659 --> 00:38:39.739
Caption: operations so we have a whole lot of

00:38:37.669 --> 00:38:41.449
Caption: them there and at the thing is once you

00:38:39.739 --> 00:38:43.399
Caption: follow this algorithm it can actually

00:38:41.449 --> 00:38:45.859
Caption: solve this problem in order of square

00:38:43.399 --> 00:38:47.959
Caption: root end time so in the past traveling

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:49.640
Caption: salesperson when it got large was too

00:38:47.959 --> 00:38:52.129
Caption: hard now we can do a lot more

00:38:49.639 --> 00:38:54.739
Caption: calculations and using the quantum

00:38:52.129 --> 00:38:57.649
Caption: system so how does this actually work

00:38:54.739 --> 00:38:58.310
Caption: this quantum approach it&#39;s hard to

00:38:57.649 --> 00:39:00.739
Caption: explain

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:03.050
Caption: remember these operations are operating

00:39:00.739 --> 00:39:05.270
Caption: on the qubits and changing their state

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:07.250
Caption: in the quantum space that&#39;s what they&#39;re

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:08.810
Caption: doing but it&#39;s hard to give an allergy

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.239
Caption: to this so the thing I best thing I saw

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:13.219
Caption: was this one if we lived in northern

00:39:11.239 --> 00:39:16.100
Caption: Africa and wanted to get to the Iberian

00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:17.780
Caption: Peninsula just across the water here if

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:20.210
Caption: we didn&#39;t have a boat we had to do

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:22.939
Caption: classical search we&#39;d go all the way

00:39:20.209 --> 00:39:25.639
Caption: around through Europe take a long time

00:39:22.939 --> 00:39:27.739
Caption: to get there but quantum computing gives

00:39:25.639 --> 00:39:29.989
Caption: us a new way to travel it&#39;s like the

00:39:27.739 --> 00:39:31.520
Caption: boat we can just go across quickly

00:39:29.989 --> 00:39:33.770
Caption: across this distance and be there in a

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.330
Caption: short amount of time it doesn&#39;t solve

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:37.010
Caption: the problem completely if this long

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:39.260
Caption: distance is still huge we&#39;re in trouble

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:41.449
Caption: but it&#39;s a lot better than taking the

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:45.830
Caption: land approach the boat solution the

00:39:41.449 --> 00:39:51.290
Caption: quantum solution is much better quantum

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:54.110
Caption: TSB ok so we saw that one yeah okay so

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:56.830
Caption: the second example as far as number

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:59.870
Caption: three there is quantum cryptography the

00:39:56.830 --> 00:40:02.479
Caption: idea here is can we use quantum systems

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:04.580
Caption: to build cryptographic systems or to

00:40:02.479 --> 00:40:06.619
Caption: crack our current cryptographic systems

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:10.190
Caption: and we have some bad news and some good

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:12.830
Caption: news the bad news is in 1994

00:40:10.189 --> 00:40:16.129
Caption: Shaw wrote an algorithm for factoring

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:18.170
Caption: integers large inches integers and it

00:40:16.129 --> 00:40:20.779
Caption: used something called a quantum fast

00:40:18.169 --> 00:40:24.919
Caption: Fourier transform it basically looks for

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:26.390
Caption: periods of repetition in numbers and he

00:40:24.919 --> 00:40:29.270
Caption: said oops he said that you could use

00:40:26.389 --> 00:40:32.689
Caption: this algorithm to factor a large integer

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:35.360
Caption: and you could do it in polynomial log of

00:40:32.689 --> 00:40:38.329
Caption: the end time which is a lot less than we

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:40.970
Caption: currently can do it so it&#39;s basically

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:42.830
Caption: almost exponentially faster than the

00:40:40.969 --> 00:40:46.939
Caption: market most efficiently non classical

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:49.060
Caption: algorithms so the bad news here is if we

00:40:46.939 --> 00:40:52.040
Caption: have a quantum computer that can do this

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:55.160
Caption: it can break all our current encryptions

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:58.040
Caption: which use large prime factors of

00:40:55.159 --> 00:41:00.469
Caption: integers that&#39;s the bad news the good

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.669
Caption: news is this was developed in 1994 and

00:41:00.469 --> 00:41:03.169
Caption: we haven&#39;t really developed a quantum

00:41:01.669 --> 00:41:05.179
Caption: computer that can do it at the moment

00:41:03.169 --> 00:41:07.939
Caption: and probably not in the next ten years

00:41:05.179 --> 00:41:10.069
Caption: we&#39;ll be able to do it but in 10 years

00:41:07.939 --> 00:41:13.369
Caption: time probably we&#39;ll be able to break a

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:15.229
Caption: current encryption this is a diagram

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:17.690
Caption: showing you how Shor&#39;s algorithm would

00:41:15.229 --> 00:41:19.429
Caption: work some of the classical operations

00:41:17.689 --> 00:41:21.649
Caption: some of the quantum operations you&#39;d do

00:41:19.429 --> 00:41:24.079
Caption: it&#39;s a prescribed set of operations on

00:41:21.649 --> 00:41:26.679
Caption: these bits and it gives you out the

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:30.320
Caption: period or the repetition or the integers

00:41:26.679 --> 00:41:32.000
Caption: factors of this large integer now no

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.830
Caption: one&#39;s implemented it yet but its

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.620
Caption: potential there once we get a computer

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:38.350
Caption: to actually do this stuff so there&#39;s a

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:42.290
Caption: warning here

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:43.070
Caption: quantum factorization is coming it

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:46.310
Caption: breaks

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:49.070
Caption: public key cryptography now as I

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:51.620
Caption: mentioned it may not happen next year it

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:53.380
Caption: may take ten years but imagine if we had

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.550
Caption: to change all of our cryptography

00:41:53.379 --> 00:41:57.769
Caption: because when this stuff happens

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:59.660
Caption: people who get these sort of computers

00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:02.419
Caption: will be able to break into all

00:41:59.659 --> 00:42:04.909
Caption: information that&#39;s currently stored in a

00:42:02.419 --> 00:42:06.949
Caption: symmetric key encryption anything that&#39;s

00:42:04.909 --> 00:42:09.289
Caption: encrypted it&#39;ll also be able to break

00:42:06.949 --> 00:42:13.040
Caption: into all communication that is currently

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:15.770
Caption: encrypted HTTP communication SSL stuff

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:18.050
Caption: all now break into it so some Russians

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:20.060
Caption: or Chinese break this stuff will

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:22.489
Caption: actually be open to them eavesdropping

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:24.199
Caption: so this is why the big government and

00:42:22.489 --> 00:42:26.449
Caption: the military in the u.s. are putting a

00:42:24.199 --> 00:42:28.550
Caption: effort into finding the next

00:42:26.449 --> 00:42:30.530
Caption: cryptography to replace replace a

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:33.020
Caption: current approach something like a

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:35.000
Caption: quantum cryptography perhaps so that

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.649
Caption: there if I can find a solution will take

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.089
Caption: seven years or so to roll out

00:42:36.649 --> 00:42:39.709
Caption: exclusively and change all our

00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:41.210
Caption: encryption will be ready when the

00:42:39.709 --> 00:42:44.868
Caption: quantum computers come along and

00:42:41.209 --> 00:42:45.919
Caption: actually break our encryption so

00:42:44.868 --> 00:42:48.529
Caption: something to worry about something to

00:42:45.919 --> 00:42:50.209
Caption: think about there the quantum solution

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:52.400
Caption: for encryption uses that idea of

00:42:50.209 --> 00:42:54.560
Caption: entanglement if we can take an electron

00:42:52.399 --> 00:42:55.760
Caption: here or a number of electrons and split

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.310
Caption: it apart and give it to somebody else

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.780
Caption: then they can look at the electrons and

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.910
Caption: see what our electrons like and that&#39;s

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:04.070
Caption: like sharing a public key and we can do

00:43:01.909 --> 00:43:05.780
Caption: that privately and instantaneously so we

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:08.180
Caption: can use the entanglement approach of

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:10.280
Caption: quantum systems to make quantum

00:43:08.179 --> 00:43:12.828
Caption: cryptography but there&#39;s no time to go

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.449
Caption: in there so last thing I want to talk

00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:16.760
Caption: about just quickly is machine learning

00:43:14.449 --> 00:43:18.858
Caption: in AI it&#39;s actually the machine learning

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.199
Caption: in AI involves a lot of systems of

00:43:18.858 --> 00:43:23.838
Caption: linear equations multiplying matrices

00:43:21.199 --> 00:43:25.368
Caption: and multiplying matrices and quantum kun

00:43:23.839 --> 00:43:27.140
Caption: is actually quite good at doing this

00:43:25.368 --> 00:43:28.459
Caption: very good at doing this you make up a

00:43:27.139 --> 00:43:31.010
Caption: whole of quantum state and you can

00:43:28.459 --> 00:43:32.358
Caption: process them like you would matrices but

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:34.040
Caption: the problem with quantum computers is

00:43:32.358 --> 00:43:35.989
Caption: you can&#39;t really get the information out

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.910
Caption: easily you cannot find is what is the

00:43:35.989 --> 00:43:40.669
Caption: solution to this quantum matrix

00:43:37.909 --> 00:43:43.068
Caption: multiplication but what you can find is

00:43:40.669 --> 00:43:44.780
Caption: properties of the solution now is it

00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:46.910
Caption: this or is it that type of solution

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:49.000
Caption: general properties holistic properties

00:43:46.909 --> 00:43:52.219
Caption: and people have actually written

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.530
Caption: recommendation engines algorithms using

00:43:52.219 --> 00:43:56.838
Caption: quantum operations that can perform

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:59.239
Caption: recommendations like a Netflix does and

00:43:56.839 --> 00:44:00.500
Caption: the way the traditional systems do it is

00:43:59.239 --> 00:44:02.598
Caption: they look at all the movies you&#39;ve

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:05.270
Caption: watched and try to recommend one based

00:44:02.599 --> 00:44:08.690
Caption: on those they&#39;re found with a quantum

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:11.030
Caption: system just by looking at a log number

00:44:08.689 --> 00:44:13.189
Caption: of queries a log number of your movies

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:15.800
Caption: so a much smaller number you can make a

00:44:13.189 --> 00:44:17.719
Caption: good recommendation so in the future we

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.969
Caption: may use quantum systems to do

00:44:17.719 --> 00:44:22.280
Caption: recommendation engines but also help

00:44:19.969 --> 00:44:25.429
Caption: with general AI algorithms to speed them

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:27.169
Caption: up to make them a lot faster so there

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:28.669
Caption: you go that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about for

00:44:27.169 --> 00:44:31.399
Caption: quantum computers today I hope that

00:44:28.669 --> 00:44:33.260
Caption: hasn&#39;t really blown your mind maybe it&#39;s

00:44:31.399 --> 00:44:34.818
Caption: expanded your mind maybe you&#39;ve learned

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:37.189
Caption: something or got a glimpse of what

00:44:34.819 --> 00:44:37.950
Caption: quantum computing is like as I said it&#39;s

00:44:37.189 --> 00:44:41.368
Caption: a quite sick

00:44:37.949 --> 00:44:43.530
Caption: difficut to wind up here I shall make a

00:44:41.368 --> 00:44:45.088
Caption: summary the first thing is hopefully

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:47.790
Caption: you&#39;ve seen that quantum computing is a

00:44:45.089 --> 00:44:50.210
Caption: really new type of computing based on

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:52.050
Caption: quantum physics not classical physics

00:44:50.209 --> 00:44:54.929
Caption: hopefully you seen that quantum

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:57.570
Caption: computers are built around operations on

00:44:54.929 --> 00:44:59.338
Caption: a number of quantum bits smallish number

00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:00.869
Caption: we probably need to get to thousands

00:44:59.339 --> 00:45:03.960
Caption: before we can do things really well but

00:45:00.868 --> 00:45:05.608
Caption: not necessarily millions and quantum

00:45:03.959 --> 00:45:07.560
Caption: computers seem to be able to solve some

00:45:05.608 --> 00:45:09.328
Caption: problems much faster than classical

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.800
Caption: computers did but they don&#39;t solve all

00:45:09.329 --> 00:45:12.650
Caption: problems they&#39;re not the magical

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.579
Caption: solution to everything

00:45:12.649 --> 00:45:15.479
Caption: there are a number of resources you

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:16.710
Caption: might want to have a look to he if you

00:45:15.479 --> 00:45:18.300
Caption: want to learn more about quantum

00:45:16.709 --> 00:45:19.949
Caption: computing you want to learn more about

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.839
Caption: the theory there&#39;s a great paper or

00:45:19.949 --> 00:45:24.300
Caption: article or book written by the National

00:45:21.839 --> 00:45:26.280
Caption: Academy of Science in the u.s. all about

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.810
Caption: quantum computing the process the

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.060
Caption: progress and the prospects for the

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:31.800
Caption: future and also a major computer

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:34.140
Caption: companies like Microsoft IBM and Google

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.939
Caption: have libraries where you can actually go

00:45:34.139 --> 00:45:38.279
Caption: and start to play around and code and

00:45:35.939 --> 00:45:40.260
Caption: that code may actually interact with the

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.209
Caption: system which is a simulation of a

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:44.399
Caption: quantum computer so you&#39;re ready when

00:45:42.209 --> 00:45:46.199
Caption: quantum computers come on but some of

00:45:44.399 --> 00:45:48.598
Caption: them actually have small-scale quantum

00:45:46.199 --> 00:45:50.219
Caption: computers say five cubits week as you

00:45:48.599 --> 00:45:52.950
Caption: run your program on a real quantum

00:45:50.219 --> 00:45:55.139
Caption: computer for free and try things out but

00:45:52.949 --> 00:45:59.399
Caption: there&#39;s no large-scale quantum computers

00:45:55.139 --> 00:46:01.318
Caption: available at this time so what are our

00:45:59.399 --> 00:46:05.608
Caption: milestones and where we at with quantum

00:46:01.319 --> 00:46:07.140
Caption: computing when we finished this shows

00:46:05.608 --> 00:46:08.699
Caption: you a number of different milestones we

00:46:07.139 --> 00:46:11.279
Caption: can go through with quantum keys to get

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:14.010
Caption: to their final endgame this side here is

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:16.229
Caption: the analog computers simulating systems

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:19.109
Caption: there&#39;s not too far to go with this one

00:46:16.229 --> 00:46:21.179
Caption: here a long way to go the first stage is

00:46:19.108 --> 00:46:24.299
Caption: probably react we&#39;ve got small systems

00:46:21.179 --> 00:46:27.780
Caption: of tens of qubits we haven&#39;t gone that

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:30.150
Caption: far the first real major milestone with

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:32.640
Caption: quantum computing is when we make some

00:46:30.149 --> 00:46:34.828
Caption: digital quantum computer that does

00:46:32.639 --> 00:46:37.559
Caption: something that&#39;s not really practical

00:46:34.829 --> 00:46:41.460
Caption: ever in a classical computer and that&#39;s

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:43.530
Caption: what we call quantum supremacy sorry

00:46:41.459 --> 00:46:45.540
Caption: quantum computers can do something that

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:47.189
Caption: a classical computer can&#39;t do or at

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:49.380
Caption: least the algorithms we know currently

00:46:47.189 --> 00:46:51.040
Caption: that&#39;s the next step but there are a lot

00:46:49.379 --> 00:46:53.449
Caption: of steps to go through there

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:55.160
Caption: so I&#39;ve had to think about the future I

00:46:53.449 --> 00:46:57.169
Caption: haven&#39;t got a crystal ball so I can&#39;t

00:46:55.159 --> 00:46:59.719
Caption: see the future they&#39;ve had to think

00:46:57.169 --> 00:47:01.549
Caption: about it what would I say well let&#39;s say

00:46:59.719 --> 00:47:03.260
Caption: that quantum supremacy

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:06.140
Caption: that&#39;s when quantum computers are better

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:09.020
Caption: is coming probably in the next few years

00:47:06.139 --> 00:47:10.819
Caption: so look at in the press in the

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:13.159
Caption: technology press if you hear talk of

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:15.500
Caption: quantum supremacy is achieved you know

00:47:13.159 --> 00:47:18.709
Caption: things are really heating up fast

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:21.260
Caption: getting important but what about the

00:47:18.709 --> 00:47:23.179
Caption: future the distance well there&#39;s one

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.919
Caption: thing about humans here and technology

00:47:23.179 --> 00:47:26.300
Caption: that I know is true and will we explain

00:47:24.919 --> 00:47:29.719
Caption: this what the future is going to be like

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:32.869
Caption: if you think about the future humans

00:47:29.719 --> 00:47:35.060
Caption: tend to predict the future linearly we

00:47:32.868 --> 00:47:37.969
Caption: see the past and put a nice linear line

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:41.660
Caption: to the future and so things don&#39;t change

00:47:37.969 --> 00:47:45.830
Caption: very much when you look linearly humans

00:47:41.659 --> 00:47:48.949
Caption: predict linearly but technology it

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:49.969
Caption: improves exponentially so we&#39;re thinking

00:47:48.949 --> 00:47:53.060
Caption: that the computers are going to just be

00:47:49.969 --> 00:47:55.520
Caption: like this I&#39;ll take 20 or 30 years but

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:57.920
Caption: does this so one thing I can say for

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.719
Caption: sure is quantum computer is going to

00:47:57.919 --> 00:48:01.790
Caption: happen sooner than you expect them to

00:47:59.719 --> 00:48:03.618
Caption: because you&#39;re predicting linearly

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:04.849
Caption: they&#39;re gonna happen a lot faster just

00:48:03.618 --> 00:48:06.409
Caption: like the internet did and voice

00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:08.000
Caption: recognition data and all this stuff it

00:48:06.409 --> 00:48:09.139
Caption: came one minute we haven&#39;t got it they

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.479
Caption: spent we&#39;ve all got it and it&#39;s just

00:48:09.139 --> 00:48:15.348
Caption: natural stuff quantum computing will be

00:48:11.479 --> 00:48:18.949
Caption: here soon so whether you get a i phone

00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:20.540
Caption: QC or not I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s no reason

00:48:18.949 --> 00:48:22.429
Caption: why we can&#39;t have room-temperature

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:23.750
Caption: superconducting stuff and we can feel it

00:48:22.429 --> 00:48:26.300
Caption: inside a device like this

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:28.459
Caption: so I&#39;m not gonna say never know people

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:32.209
Caption: who say never always prove wrong but

00:48:28.459 --> 00:48:33.800
Caption: possibly so that&#39;s the end of my talk

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:35.659
Caption: and we&#39;ve talked about exploiting heads

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:40.070
Caption: and here&#39;s one head I would like to

00:48:35.659 --> 00:48:42.649
Caption: explode but maybe not but even if your

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:44.390
Caption: head did explode today hopefully you saw

00:48:42.649 --> 00:48:45.739
Caption: some beauty along the way and it was an

00:48:44.389 --> 00:48:47.868
Caption: interesting and you saw an elegant

00:48:45.739 --> 00:48:50.089
Caption: glimpse into what quantum computing and

00:48:47.868 --> 00:48:51.829
Caption: quantum computers and programming of

00:48:50.089 --> 00:48:55.580
Caption: quantum systems and the solutions I can

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:56.839
Caption: solve will be like thank you very much

00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:00.550
Caption: but I think we have time for questions

00:48:56.839 --> 00:49:00.550
Caption: but that&#39;s all thank you
