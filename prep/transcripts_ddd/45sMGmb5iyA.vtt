00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.319
Caption: so without further ado for me I will

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:06.210
Caption: hand you over to red to talk about all

00:00:04.318 --> 00:00:08.879
Caption: the applications to block choke the art

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.329
Caption: cryptocurrency thank you rob

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.530
Caption: hi guys thanks for coming before I start

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.630
Caption: this one of different big thanks to all

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:17.010
Caption: of our sponsors without them this event

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.959
Caption: couldn&#39;t be possible and it&#39;s really

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.069
Caption: awesome to see the sort of support at

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:22.709
Caption: these corporations and these companies

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:26.909
Caption: give to to the developer community in Wi

00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:27.538
Caption: so thank you very much a quick show of

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.819
Caption: hands

00:00:27.538 --> 00:00:31.229
Caption: does anyone own any cryptocurrency have

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:36.000
Caption: in the past

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:39.169
Caption: Wow okay cool you know brief small

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.969
Caption: disclaimer I don&#39;t own any I never have

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:43.349
Caption: but the technology that underpins it and

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.550
Caption: that big blockchain is something it

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:47.218
Caption: really fascinates me and I think there

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:52.549
Caption: are some some real useful applications

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:55.559
Caption: outside of cryptocurrency hence the chat

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:59.549
Caption: so what you can expect from this session

00:00:55.558 --> 00:01:01.948
Caption: a bit understanding a blockchain

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.419
Caption: if you you&#39;ve heard about it but you

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.250
Caption: don&#39;t really know what it is I&#39;m going

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:07.500
Caption: to explain the P building blocks for it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.798
Caption: and then of course some real world

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.069
Caption: applications outside of cryptocurrency

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.619
Caption: what not to expect we will not teach you

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:19.080
Caption: how to get rich on Bitcoin that&#39;s

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.090
Caption: another chat smart contracts

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.630
Caption: unfortunately the length of the chat

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:30.389
Caption: will prevent much depth of discussion

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:32.508
Caption: within contracts maybe next year and a

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:34.798
Caption: live demo I did intend to do a live demo

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.579
Caption: I&#39;ve written a small block Danette

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.250
Caption: myself but again session the constraints

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.770
Caption: can&#39;t prevent that I will make the code

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.229
Caption: available publicly and I&#39;ll show that so

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:51.618
Caption: grab me on Twitter or LinkedIn or

00:01:46.228 --> 00:01:54.839
Caption: whatever and let me know a bit about me

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.409
Caption: I&#39;m a developer first and foremost I&#39;ve

00:01:54.839 --> 00:02:01.048
Caption: been programming since 20 odd years I&#39;m

00:01:58.408 --> 00:02:04.798
Caption: sorry a little over that I broke my

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.880
Caption: first programming qbasic joys and more

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.220
Caption: recently I&#39;ve been involved with

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:10.639
Caption: integration that&#39;s been a specialization

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.639
Caption: I&#39;ve done

00:02:11.378 --> 00:02:15.429
Caption: I&#39;m currently a team lead like Ron

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:17.789
Caption: mentioned RAC I lead a great team of

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:20.649
Caption: developers and engineers and testers

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:23.738
Caption: they&#39;re a fantastic bunch I&#39;m also a

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:26.798
Caption: gamer both playing and developing hash

00:02:23.738 --> 00:02:29.250
Caption: tag made with unity and I&#39;m a petrol

00:02:26.798 --> 00:02:31.149
Caption: head so I love cars especially fast ones

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.119
Caption: if you want to catch me about any of

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:38.439
Caption: those please do so what is bloc changing

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:42.069
Caption: blockchain in its in a simplest form is

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.430
Caption: a collection of databases distributed

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.119
Caption: across multiple nodes all services

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:51.759
Caption: across everywhere which have data which

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:55.598
Caption: are linked together through crypto war

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:59.289
Caption: Cryptococcus cryptography that&#39;s in its

00:02:55.598 --> 00:03:00.878
Caption: simplest form it can be referred to as a

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:04.208
Caption: distributed database or a distributed

00:03:00.878 --> 00:03:07.259
Caption: ledger it&#39;s worth noting and it&#39;s more

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:10.598
Caption: caveat that it is possible to have a

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:12.518
Caption: blockchain that isn&#39;t distributed there

00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:14.649
Caption: isn&#39;t much value in doing so and I&#39;ll

00:03:12.518 --> 00:03:17.039
Caption: get to it later there are some severe

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:19.418
Caption: drawbacks and never can drawbacks to

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:25.388
Caption: blockchain which would rarely prevent

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:27.040
Caption: doing is that making that much value but

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.290
Caption: there are three key benefits or three

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:32.319
Caption: key properties of blockchain which make

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:34.689
Caption: it really really cool first of all it&#39;s

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.729
Caption: immutable so what do I mean by that it

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.619
Caption: means that the stuff that&#39;s in there

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:41.018
Caption: cannot be changed it can never be

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:44.589
Caption: updated you can add more stuff to it you

00:03:41.018 --> 00:03:47.679
Caption: can never change it it&#39;s also crustless

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:49.358
Caption: so you don&#39;t have to know all those

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:53.198
Caption: nodes that are in the network you you

00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:56.319
Caption: don&#39;t have to trust them at all and

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:58.660
Caption: that&#39;s purely by the mechanisms that are

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:03.669
Caption: in play when stuff is added to the

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.049
Caption: blockchain it&#39;s inherently trusted it&#39;s

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.680
Caption: also highly resilient because it&#39;s

00:04:05.048 --> 00:04:10.418
Caption: distributed you can have millions and

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:14.828
Caption: you can have hundreds of thousands and

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:16.539
Caption: fail and it will still work it&#39;s

00:04:14.828 --> 00:04:17.229
Caption: possible to have public and private

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.968
Caption: blockchains

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.468
Caption: public plug games like all the

00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:23.468
Caption: cryptocurrencies bitcoins aetherium

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:24.009
Caption: ripple black coin the works you can also

00:04:23.468 --> 00:04:26.889
Caption: private

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.180
Caption: that for a more specific purpose that

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.830
Caption: might be in government or in an

00:04:28.179 --> 00:04:32.889
Caption: organization they&#39;ve been ERP something

00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:34.929
Caption: like that and of course like I mentioned

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.330
Caption: they can serve smart contracts smart

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:40.380
Caption: contracts have huge benefits and huge

00:04:37.329 --> 00:04:44.279
Caption: uses use cases in things like insurance

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:48.489
Caption: and financial industries

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:51.220
Caption: why should you care well CrunchBase

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:53.859
Caption: found 1.3 billion reasons why you should

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.209
Caption: care and that&#39;s just what they know

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:59.679
Caption: about and that&#39;s just for the first half

00:04:55.209 --> 00:05:01.660
Caption: of this year and it&#39;s worth noting

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:04.600
Caption: that&#39;s also just venture capital that is

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.640
Caption: not everything that&#39;s certainly not

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.000
Caption: doesn&#39;t include what all these guys are

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.480
Caption: doing they&#39;re all doing something in

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.100
Caption: blockchain somewhere in various days so

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.610
Caption: something pilots some of the actual

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.770
Caption: production uses but it&#39;s clear that if

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:23.979
Caption: they all care about it it&#39;s clearly a

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:27.940
Caption: thing so it&#39;s worth at least getting to

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:33.510
Caption: know a bit better so it might be awesome

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:40.360
Caption: yourself how does that work well magic

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:44.350
Caption: really okay no sorry the tree cryptic

00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:47.559
Caption: cryptography peering and consensus or

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.690
Caption: what make it work they form sort of the

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:56.559
Caption: ingredients that make up this blockchain

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:58.809
Caption: pie photography is first and I suppose

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:02.350
Caption: one of the key foundation building

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:05.260
Caption: blocks and it&#39;s essentially what holds

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.029
Caption: lock chains together Photography serves

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.450
Caption: many different uses when you browse a

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:12.279
Caption: website it&#39;s got TLS it&#39;s photography

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:15.840
Caption: there are I suppose essentially two

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:18.940
Caption: types of groups of good cryptography

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:20.380
Caption: there&#39;s encryption which is what you

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.910
Caption: would do on your websites and if you

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.440
Caption: wanted to share information securely you

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.260
Caption: want to encrypt it in one place and

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:30.000
Caption: decrypt another but then this hash

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:35.529
Caption: and hashing is really what what makes

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.690
Caption: blockchain work so passion is a

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:41.649
Caption: deterministic method of taking something

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:43.989
Caption: and turning it into a parent garbage but

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:46.209
Caption: it&#39;s useful as a verification mechanism

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:48.250
Caption: it&#39;s a termina stick and that you feed

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:49.600
Caption: something in and if you the same thing

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.380
Caption: in over and over you will get the same

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.059
Caption: result at the end every single time it

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.399
Caption: is not reversible though so you cannot

00:06:55.059 --> 00:07:02.399
Caption: take a hash and then turn it back into

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:07.209
Caption: its original state that doesn&#39;t work but

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:09.459
Caption: hashing is what makes it immutable all

00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:19.419
Caption: the blocks as in the diagram here you

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:23.500
Caption: can see I&#39;ll link together cache for a

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:25.480
Caption: block links to the previous block so if

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.220
Caption: a block has hash one two three

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.610
Caption: the next block will have a reference to

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:33.570
Caption: the hash of one two three before it now

00:07:30.609 --> 00:07:35.919
Caption: how does that actually make it immutable

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:38.800
Caption: well because the hash is generated on

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.410
Caption: the data within the block you cannot

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:43.989
Caption: change that data without changing the

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:47.519
Caption: hash so now if you change the hash it

00:07:43.989 --> 00:07:51.569
Caption: breaks the entire chain so you cannot

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:54.729
Caption: realistically do that

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:57.730
Caption: peirong is what makes the distributed

00:07:54.730 --> 00:08:00.360
Caption: nature or provides a distribution for a

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:04.690
Caption: blockchain across a whole lot of nodes

00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:06.219
Caption: it also serves as a mechanism for or

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.320
Caption: just finding out new nodes and

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:12.160
Caption: distributing a list of nodes to other

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:15.820
Caption: peers and it&#39;s the reason for its

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:21.429
Caption: resilience it&#39;s if you use something

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:23.260
Caption: like BitTorrent for example saying you

00:08:21.429 --> 00:08:26.259
Caption: can find you can always find a node

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.910
Caption: somewhere it&#39;ll pick it up it&#39;ll find

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.779
Caption: it&#39;ll discover a hit list of nodes and

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:33.070
Caption: you&#39;ll be able to get to those

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:35.299
Caption: regardless of how many go on and offline

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:38.669
Caption: all the

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:40.229
Caption: and peer-to-peer is essentially what it

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.849
Caption: is and it&#39;s similar to our good old

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:43.979
Caption: friend Napster anyone remember Napster

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:47.429
Caption: yeah yeah

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:51.049
Caption: a donkey either works and one of the key

00:08:47.429 --> 00:08:54.299
Caption: one of the nice ways of methods of

00:08:51.049 --> 00:08:57.450
Caption: creating a PHP Network is distributed

00:08:54.299 --> 00:09:00.059
Caption: hash tables separate hash tables are a

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:02.460
Caption: key value pair of all of your nodes in a

00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:04.770
Caption: block and they can all discover each

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.890
Caption: other and they can find out what other

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:10.500
Caption: nodes exist in a network and through

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.239
Caption: this mechanism you can ensure that even

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.739
Caption: if you know it goes on or offline or

00:09:12.239 --> 00:09:17.669
Caption: this node goes on the offline you can

00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:19.469
Caption: still find it someone else there are

00:09:17.669 --> 00:09:21.359
Caption: different mechanisms as well you could

00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:23.250
Caption: also build your own custom layer flixel

00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:25.409
Caption: layer seven protocol to discover nodes

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.570
Caption: if you want to do something like HTTP

00:09:25.409 --> 00:09:29.849
Caption: and find stuff like that you could do so

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:36.570
Caption: there are medications to doing so but

00:09:29.849 --> 00:09:38.579
Caption: you could do so but this this is the

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:42.840
Caption: most interesting part for me and that&#39;s

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:45.510
Caption: consensus so imagine you have a million

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.940
Caption: nodes in your network and they all have

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.500
Caption: to try and figure out what is the

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.080
Caption: blockchain currently look like what is

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.960
Caption: the state how do you figure that out

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.820
Caption: how does if half of them are all getting

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.470
Caption: new information that they need to add to

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.260
Caption: the blockchain how do you figure out who

00:09:58.469 --> 00:10:03.269
Caption: actually gets to add the next block you

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.100
Caption: know one will add it on maybe in

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.270
Caption: Austrailia another one in europe oldest

00:10:05.099 --> 00:10:09.509
Caption: I don&#39;t know I want that block instead

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:11.970
Caption: my books better so how do you do that

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:16.619
Caption: and that that really is what&#39;s known as

00:10:11.969 --> 00:10:17.609
Caption: a Byzantine generals problem and the

00:10:16.619 --> 00:10:19.619
Caption: Byzantine generals problem is a

00:10:17.609 --> 00:10:21.839
Caption: fascinating one and it actually spans

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:25.679
Caption: many different disciplines very many

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:28.170
Caption: different domains things like aviation

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:30.929
Caption: systems for example they have to know

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:33.179
Caption: which system is down or which system is

00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:36.000
Caption: not down at a point and who can reliably

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:38.359
Caption: fly a plane which system is responsible

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.530
Caption: for doing that job at that time and

00:10:38.359 --> 00:10:43.140
Caption: that&#39;s a problem

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.220
Caption: that solved with Byzantine fault

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.989
Caption: tolerance

00:10:44.219 --> 00:10:49.979
Caption: now the Byzantine generals problem comes

00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:52.359
Caption: from the theories that the theory says

00:10:49.979 --> 00:10:55.389
Caption: there are several general Byzantine

00:10:52.359 --> 00:10:57.338
Caption: generals generals that control portions

00:10:55.390 --> 00:11:00.970
Caption: of the Byzantine army and they all want

00:10:57.338 --> 00:11:01.750
Caption: to attack the city so in order to figure

00:11:00.969 --> 00:11:05.469
Caption: out what they need to do they have to

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:07.539
Caption: agree on plan and any plan that doesn&#39;t

00:11:05.469 --> 00:11:09.849
Caption: isn&#39;t concerted so if part of them leave

00:11:07.539 --> 00:11:11.619
Caption: and half of them decide to fight it&#39;s

00:11:09.849 --> 00:11:14.979
Caption: gonna be failure it&#39;s gonna be a

00:11:11.619 --> 00:11:18.518
Caption: disaster so they have to either agree to

00:11:14.979 --> 00:11:20.078
Caption: retreat or to fight this is further

00:11:18.518 --> 00:11:22.898
Caption: complicated by things like treacherous

00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:25.299
Caption: generals you know ones that&#39;ll will try

00:11:22.898 --> 00:11:27.010
Caption: to misinform and they will get another

00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:30.518
Caption: general to send his army in and they&#39;ll

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:32.648
Caption: go and free or what about they&#39;re

00:11:30.518 --> 00:11:34.000
Caption: physically distributed that located in

00:11:32.648 --> 00:11:35.289
Caption: the different locations geographic

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.909
Caption: locations so you&#39;re then actually a

00:11:35.289 --> 00:11:40.838
Caption: messenger what if a messenger gets lost

00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:42.309
Caption: what if what if that messenger is

00:11:40.838 --> 00:11:46.659
Caption: actually going and forging his own

00:11:42.309 --> 00:11:56.528
Caption: messages so you have to figure out a way

00:11:46.659 --> 00:11:59.349
Caption: to to kind of come to a consensus and in

00:11:56.528 --> 00:12:02.669
Caption: a blockchain world that&#39;s done through

00:11:59.349 --> 00:12:06.159
Caption: consensus algorithms this is a form of

00:12:02.669 --> 00:12:07.690
Caption: Byzantine fault tolerance and in fact of

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:10.419
Caption: the era at the moment there are two

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:12.369
Caption: primary methods of doing so there are

00:12:10.419 --> 00:12:15.869
Caption: others but these are probably the

00:12:12.369 --> 00:12:19.059
Caption: biggest proof of work and proof of stake

00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:21.239
Caption: proof of work is is fairly common it&#39;s

00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:24.458
Caption: probably the most common one and it

00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:27.570
Caption: involves computational difficulty so you

00:12:24.458 --> 00:12:30.479
Caption: compute computing or doing a

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:32.039
Caption: computationally difficult or calculative

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:36.000
Caption: okay

00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:39.549
Caption: something it takes a long time to

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.958
Caption: effectively work out to prove that

00:12:39.549 --> 00:12:44.198
Caption: you&#39;ve done something and it&#39;s valid

00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:48.010
Caption: what the does the disincentivizes those

00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:50.229
Caption: nodes all those treacherous general that

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.820
Caption: want to do something bad because they

00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:57.299
Caption: have to invest

00:12:51.820 --> 00:13:00.190
Caption: it into doing so but the way it works is

00:12:57.299 --> 00:13:02.859
Caption: hashing comes back to our hashing so

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:04.630
Caption: every node will take its block of data

00:13:02.859 --> 00:13:07.029
Caption: and it will run a hash of it

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.979
Caption: and the difficulty is applied by

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.440
Caption: requiring that hash to meet certain

00:13:08.979 --> 00:13:14.649
Caption: criteria and it could be something like

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.359
Caption: having the first X number of zeros first

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:22.030
Caption: X number of characters of the hash being

00:13:16.359 --> 00:13:24.640
Caption: zero now I did a test and I was able to

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:26.530
Caption: get started off with trying to get into

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.260
Caption: single zero completed incidentally two

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:31.690
Caption: zeros couple seconds three zeros two

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.760
Caption: more seconds four zeros it was up to

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:36.520
Caption: like a minute five zeros then it was

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:39.640
Caption: taking multiple minutes six zeros and so

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:42.220
Caption: on so and the way that&#39;s done is that&#39;s

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.920
Caption: done by taking the data because as I

00:13:42.219 --> 00:13:47.129
Caption: mentioned to you before a hash will

00:13:44.919 --> 00:13:50.229
Caption: always the data will always have a

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:51.789
Caption: single hash the data entered will always

00:13:50.229 --> 00:13:53.199
Caption: have a single value at the end so the

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:55.000
Caption: way you change that value is by adding

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.720
Caption: additional data so you&#39;ll add what&#39;s

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.210
Caption: called a nonce

00:13:55.719 --> 00:14:00.309
Caption: and a nonce to the end of it will then

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.510
Caption: be randomized it and you try it again

00:14:00.309 --> 00:14:03.250
Caption: and you try it again and you try it

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.799
Caption: again and eventually you&#39;ll come up with

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:09.369
Caption: your values and that gives you your

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:11.679
Caption: proof of work proof of stake though is

00:14:09.369 --> 00:14:13.599
Caption: somewhat more interesting in some cases

00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:16.149
Caption: there are different method mechanisms be

00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:18.159
Caption: using proof of stake one of the ones I

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:21.160
Caption: quite like is or burrows or burrows

00:14:18.159 --> 00:14:23.259
Caption: algorithm that is effectively a form of

00:14:21.159 --> 00:14:24.609
Caption: voting the proof of stakes core

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.960
Caption: principle is that you have to have an

00:14:24.609 --> 00:14:28.510
Caption: investment in it you have to have

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.340
Caption: something that&#39;s on value that you&#39;re

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:33.669
Caption: going to invest and if you are found to

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:37.600
Caption: be legitimate you will then lose your

00:14:33.669 --> 00:14:39.399
Caption: stake in some way this is actually used

00:14:37.599 --> 00:14:41.229
Caption: in theorems Kaspar protocol if anyone&#39;s

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.360
Caption: interested it&#39;s quite cool

00:14:41.229 --> 00:14:47.320
Caption: it&#39;s delegated proof of stake which is

00:14:43.359 --> 00:14:49.510
Caption: an offshoot of proof of stake by putting

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.429
Caption: all together essentially you have a

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:55.390
Caption: group of nodes communicating over peer

00:14:51.429 --> 00:14:59.200
Caption: to peer each node compiles its block and

00:14:55.390 --> 00:15:03.220
Caption: hashes it using cryptography the nodes

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:06.190
Caption: the complete nodes are then voted on

00:15:03.219 --> 00:15:08.679
Caption: or there are some census that is applied

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.210
Caption: to it to identify which node should then

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:12.010
Caption: be applied to the block once that

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.840
Caption: agreement is reached the block is then

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:17.739
Caption: distributed or that results as tribute

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:19.510
Caption: and the block is added to the chain so

00:15:17.739 --> 00:15:22.179
Caption: practical applications and this is

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.559
Caption: really one of the key port parts of this

00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:27.820
Caption: chat is I really wanted to highlight

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:32.320
Caption: these there are numerous supply chain is

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:33.669
Caption: an obvious one you can track your you

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.609
Caption: track the entire supply chain printer

00:15:33.669 --> 00:15:37.750
Caption: when where the materials come from

00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:40.209
Caption: processing of them the building of them

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:42.669
Caption: when they&#39;re shipped to a shop when they

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:45.130
Caption: are purchased you can track that entire

00:15:42.669 --> 00:15:47.709
Caption: journey and this is this lighting comes

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:51.419
Caption: out of a requirement for by consumers

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:55.809

00:15:59.409 --> 00:16:05.079

Caption: do a bait to plate transparency project

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:18.040
Caption: but you know trade and essentially what

00:16:15.429 --> 00:16:20.109
Caption: they did was they can track where the

00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:22.959
Caption: fish was caught who caught it when it

00:16:20.109 --> 00:16:24.669
Caption: was caught where it&#39;s processed and

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.550

00:16:24.669 --> 00:16:29.919
Caption: install take a QR code reader QR code

00:16:27.549 --> 00:16:32.289
Caption: off of the antenna tuna and know exactly

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:34.089
Caption: everything about it and what that does

00:16:32.289 --> 00:16:37.119
Caption: is that stamps out slave trade it&#39;s damn

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:39.970

00:16:37.119 --> 00:16:41.679
Caption: addresses unsafe work conditions they

00:16:39.969 --> 00:16:46.929
Caption: used the bind platform for that just by

Caption: M and that was for apparel that was for

00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:03.510

Caption: cotton came from where it&#39;s processed

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:09.160

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.928
Caption: significant and per goal is to end

00:17:21.979 --> 00:17:27.130
