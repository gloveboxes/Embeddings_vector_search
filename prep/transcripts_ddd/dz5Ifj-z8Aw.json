  "description": "A new toxic element has emerged within the workplace, the defence of \u201Cbest practice\u201D. This blanket term has become ubiquitous amongst many architectural design sessions and it is hurting innovation and user outcomes. The term \u201Cbest practice\u201D is often used without any context and used to justify someone\u2019s design decisions without having to explain that justification. It is a term that is used to shutdown any discussion, and will likely be used to elevate one\u2019s ideas without merit.\\n\\nI frequently push people to break down their assertion that their design decisions are \u201Cbest practice\u201D. This involves challenging people to firstly understand the goals with greater clarity:\\nAre we prioritising costs, user enablement, time? \\nWhat constraints are we working with? Do we have specific environments we have to work in?\\nWhat problem are we ACTUALLY trying to solve?\\n\\nBy embracing these elements, we can actually frame our decisions in a way that enable a greater level of understanding by rephrasing \u201Cbest practice\u201D into something that is more structured. For example:\\n\\nAs we are trying to get our customers using {product feature} as quickly as possible, I think we should look at using {service A} with {service B} as it will allow us to get consumers on our platform using {product C} quickly. \\n\\nBy focusing more on the problem, the priorities/constraints, we can design solutions together that meet our needs, rather than just doing what someone else did and call it \u201Cbest practice\u201D\\n\\nNo experience necessary\\n10 mins (lightning talk)\\nLeadership/Management\\nA passionate tech geek that is focused on business solutions. I work well in ambiguous environments where end goals and business outcomes are the key priorities. I am tool agnostic and comfortable working in new environments. I have many years working with data, and have worked across all stages of the data pipeline. The primary focus of my career has been focusing on data modelling, data transformations, data analysis and reporting."
