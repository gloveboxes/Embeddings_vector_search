00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.350
Caption: work in a group that&#39;s called the API

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:04.079
Caption: Academy I&#39;m just gonna talk about them

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:07.368
Caption: briefly because they co-sponsored a lot

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.740
Caption: of my travel API Academy is a group of

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.870
Caption: sort of researchers they sometimes use

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.610
Caption: the word thought leaders that are based

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:17.459

Caption: and I&#39;m the one that&#39;s in Kentucky and

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:23.779
Caption: we travel around all of them travel

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:26.549
Caption: around like I do we get to meet

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:28.979
Caption: organisations collect up ideas and share

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.229
Caption: that back the last big project we

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:33.300
Caption: completed was a book on micro services

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:35.819
Caption: about a year ago where we got a chance

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.150
Caption: to talk to companies like Netflix in

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.050
Caption: Google and Amazon and SoundCloud and

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.729
Caption: uber and all these other organizations

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.529
Caption: to figure out what they&#39;re doing and how

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:46.289
Caption: they&#39;re doing it so that&#39;s a chance to

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:48.800
Caption: share that so we have a website if you

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:51.000
Caption: just look up API Academy you&#39;ll find it

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.529
Caption: so it&#39;s a great place to collect

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.899
Caption: information and a lot of the things that

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:57.179
Caption: I&#39;m going to share today are things that

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:59.429
Caption: we&#39;ve learned in lots of other companies

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:01.439
Caption: around the world as well so this is my

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:04.589
Caption: chance to share with you and this is a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.119
Caption: chance for us to just kind of talk so I

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:08.759
Caption: wanted to do something a little bit

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:10.619
Caption: unusual this isn&#39;t going to be a really

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:12.839
Caption: techy talk it&#39;s not going to be I don&#39;t

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:16.169
Caption: have any URLs or anything like this in

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:18.929
Caption: it but a lot of people that I work with

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:20.849
Caption: are trying to figure out how to create

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:22.589
Caption: great api&#39;s how to create great

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.050
Caption: interfaces to their business to their

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:27.720
Caption: services some of the customers I work

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.729
Caption: with are actually in competition in a

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.820
Caption: market like in third parties to attract

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:34.949
Caption: developers to their api&#39;s it&#39;s very much

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.290
Caption: a market driven business so they&#39;re

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.759
Caption: trying to figure out how to do that so

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:40.768
Caption: they talk a lot about what&#39;s good what&#39;s

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:43.559
Caption: great what&#39;s useable what&#39;s functional

00:03:40.768 --> 00:03:45.500
Caption: how can we make this better and I

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:48.899
Caption: remember a book from a long time ago

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.600
Caption: about business management called good to

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:54.720
Caption: great when these characteristics that

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.790
Caption: James Collins had about what companies

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.220
Caption: are great and why they&#39;re great how do

00:03:56.789 --> 00:04:00.439
Caption: they get from just being good to

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.790
Caption: actually being bad

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.010
Caption: and I thought well I&#39;d like to go back

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:07.079
Caption: and relook at those things and see if

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:09.569
Caption: those kinds of lessons those kinds of

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.208
Caption: characteristics can maybe be applied in

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.770
Caption: the same kind of way so so this is this

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:15.600
Caption: is James Collins

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.250
Caption: James has written several books James

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.040
Caption: looks pretty severe and most of his

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:25.320
Caption: publicity photos but he is apparently a

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.149
Caption: pretty friendly guy and he spent a bunch

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.679
Caption: of time he&#39;s from Harvard Business

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:31.019
Caption: School and all these other things and he

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:33.690
Caption: spent a lot of time on this idea about

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:34.769
Caption: what is it about certain characteristics

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.059
Caption: of a business there&#39;s certain

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:38.339
Caption: characteristics of a group of people

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:40.859
Caption: that actually make it rise above in some

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:41.940
Caption: kind of way so he wrote this book and

00:04:40.859 --> 00:04:45.209
Caption: you were at this book I think was in the

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.919
Caption: 80s I can&#39;t quite remember but he wrote

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:49.350
Caption: about this idea of how you transition

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.570
Caption: from good to great how you get from one

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.760
Caption: place to another what would help people

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.200
Caption: kind of identify whether or not you&#39;re

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.260
Caption: actually on the path you&#39;re actually

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.140
Caption: gonna pull this off the secondary lesson

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.630
Caption: in his book there was a little bit more

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:07.229
Caption: concerning it&#39;s how most people don&#39;t

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.630
Caption: make it so what are those unique things

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.700
Caption: that actually make it possible so I

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.919
Caption: figured out how can we do that can we

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.520
Caption: apply some of the same ideas to this

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:20.640
Caption: world of api&#39;s in many ways many of my

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:23.609
Caption: customers for for them api SAR a product

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.890
Caption: api&#39;s are a marketplace a PR are a

00:05:23.609 --> 00:05:27.989
Caption: business imperative they&#39;re not just a

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.940
Caption: back-office element they&#39;re not just a

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:33.479
Caption: way to reduce cost they&#39;re a way to

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.040
Caption: actually create opportunity so it would

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:38.429
Caption: seem to make sense if we can apply some

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.279
Caption: of these same ideas so Collins has these

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:42.720
Caption: things he calls the seven principles

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.989
Caption: some of these may sound familiar you may

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.279
Caption: recognize them from some other source

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:49.168
Caption: I&#39;m not gonna go through them too much

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:52.769
Caption: in detail but he has this notion of

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.539
Caption: level 5 leaders this idea of you first

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:57.509
Caption: figure out who you&#39;re dealing with and

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.919
Caption: then what you&#39;re gonna do you confront

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.839
Caption: brutal facts which I thought there&#39;s a

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.119
Caption: really interesting one you&#39;re actually

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:05.039
Caption: brutally honest with yourself and

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:07.049
Caption: everyone else and that&#39;s how you

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.158
Caption: actually start to get ahead

00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:11.500
Caption: this is an interesting story that&#39;s

00:06:09.158 --> 00:06:13.359
Caption: called a hedgehog concept it&#39;s a little

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.848
Caption: bit like the tortoise and hare story the

00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:17.529
Caption: head truckin and the Fox is an old tale

00:06:15.848 --> 00:06:20.019
Caption: and it turns out the Hedgehog always

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.539
Caption: wins the hedgehog Hedgehog always

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:25.448
Caption: outsmarts the Fox and why is that and

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:27.938
Caption: it&#39;s because the Hedgehog has a real

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.309
Caption: commitment because if he loses he dies

00:06:27.938 --> 00:06:32.619
Caption: he&#39;s like it were got a real passion for

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:34.059
Caption: success a culture of discipline this is

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:35.949
Caption: a pattern that I see in lots of

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:39.429
Caption: companies that I visit the ones that are

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:41.468
Caption: really good they&#39;re they&#39;re really good

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:43.658
Caption: at doing the little things are really

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:46.688
Caption: good at doing the mundane things and

00:06:43.658 --> 00:06:48.729
Caption: we&#39;ll talk about that I love this idea

00:06:46.688 --> 00:06:52.059
Caption: using technology to accelerate growth

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.649
Caption: for us API space or in the IT space we

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:55.658
Caption: would say oh sure of course you would

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:57.098
Caption: but he&#39;s got a really interesting point

00:06:55.658 --> 00:06:59.829
Caption: of view on this which basically says

00:06:57.098 --> 00:07:04.628
Caption: using technology just for technology&#39;s

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:06.908
Caption: sake is a disaster is a big mistake and

00:07:04.628 --> 00:07:09.218
Caption: it&#39;s hard for us sometimes to know

00:07:06.908 --> 00:07:11.259
Caption: especially when we&#39;re in IT to actually

00:07:09.218 --> 00:07:13.899
Caption: tell our business management or tell our

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:16.088
Caption: leadership to say you know what it&#39;s not

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:18.278
Caption: really a good idea to convert that or to

00:07:16.088 --> 00:07:20.319
Caption: spend time on that we should leave that

00:07:18.278 --> 00:07:22.569
Caption: alone leave that legacy thing alone we

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:23.769
Caption: should do this over here instead a lot

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:25.598
Caption: of times if we&#39;re given an opportunity

00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:26.859
Caption: to rebuild the same house again we&#39;d

00:07:25.598 --> 00:07:28.989
Caption: love to do it right

00:07:26.859 --> 00:07:31.179
Caption: matter of fact what we first do is we&#39;d

00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:32.348
Caption: actually destroy the old one sort of

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:34.869
Caption: like ghosts oviya they could never

00:07:32.348 --> 00:07:36.519
Caption: existed that old version never existed

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:38.859
Caption: we just replaced a brand new one right

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:40.869
Caption: we don&#39;t like a lot of history a lot of

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:42.489
Caption: times and then the last one he talks

00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:45.009
Caption: about the flywheel this comes up in a

00:07:42.489 --> 00:07:47.500
Caption: couple of other different cases the idea

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:49.059
Caption: of once you get started once you get

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.549
Caption: rolling even if you can move it a little

00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:54.039
Caption: bit it gets easier and easier and easier

00:07:51.549 --> 00:07:56.468
Caption: and easier so this flywheel concept

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:58.838
Caption: comes in really handy as well so all

00:07:56.468 --> 00:08:01.809
Caption: these things about leadership and focus

00:07:58.838 --> 00:08:06.369
Caption: and discipline and and all these other

00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:09.579
Caption: things all lead to what means greatness

00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:12.009
Caption: in in Collins eyes so

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:15.668
Caption: I thought maybe we can talk about this

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:17.919
Caption: from just an amp in API perspective what

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:19.839
Caption: do we need how does it work what does

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:22.809
Caption: that look like and the first thing I

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:25.688
Caption: think about is developers we hear these

00:08:22.809 --> 00:08:28.269
Caption: stories about 10x developers or

00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:30.459
Caption: full-stack developers or hero developers

00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:31.989
Caption: or all these other things in in the we

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:34.778
Caption: have a kind of a romantic notion about

00:08:31.989 --> 00:08:36.760
Caption: some developer that spends like they

00:08:34.778 --> 00:08:37.989
Caption: have no personal life they do everything

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.268
Caption: at work and they&#39;re amazing people

00:08:37.989 --> 00:08:43.359
Caption: nobody understands how she pulls it off

00:08:40.268 --> 00:08:45.849
Caption: but this stuff always works and it turns

00:08:43.359 --> 00:08:47.700
Caption: out that&#39;s not really a good path to

00:08:45.849 --> 00:08:50.828
Caption: greatness it actually is a path to

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:53.190
Caption: somebody getting burned out a company

00:08:50.828 --> 00:08:56.708
Caption: having a huge dependence on just a few

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:58.809
Caption: heroic people yet and those people often

00:08:56.708 --> 00:09:01.260
Caption: end up leaving because they don&#39;t have a

00:08:58.809 --> 00:09:03.940
Caption: balanced life so what is a good

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.190
Caption: developer and this level-5 thing is

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.169
Caption: actually pretty handy I like the way

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:11.619
Caption: Collins talks about what level 5

00:09:08.169 --> 00:09:14.078
Caption: developers are in essence he talks about

00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:16.268
Caption: he talks about them as leaders but he

00:09:14.078 --> 00:09:18.778
Caption: says they&#39;re people who are humble but

00:09:16.268 --> 00:09:20.948
Caption: driven to do what&#39;s best for the company

00:09:18.778 --> 00:09:23.260
Caption: there are lots of people that I get a

00:09:20.948 --> 00:09:25.419
Caption: chance to meet and talk to who work in

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.059
Caption: these IT programs these capi programs

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:30.429
Caption: and they&#39;re really smart and they&#39;re

00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:33.578
Caption: really really intelligent and they&#39;re

00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:36.070
Caption: also incredibly generous and that

00:09:33.578 --> 00:09:38.380
Caption: usually is a sign that they work in a

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:41.018
Caption: community where that kind of behavior is

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:43.809
Caption: is promoted and they usually build some

00:09:41.018 --> 00:09:45.820
Caption: of the greatest stuff they just work

00:09:43.809 --> 00:09:47.979
Caption: really hard and they don&#39;t look for a

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.140
Caption: lot of attention and that&#39;s pretty

00:09:47.979 --> 00:09:51.518
Caption: amazing

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.320
Caption: when Collins talks about it he talks

00:09:51.518 --> 00:09:56.139
Caption: about it as sort of your role in the

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:59.078
Caption: organization that in the beginning like

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.910
Caption: the level one is just it&#39;s a capable

00:09:59.078 --> 00:10:03.639
Caption: individual this somebody does their job

00:10:00.909 --> 00:10:06.009
Caption: well know what&#39;s going on keep up with

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.600
Caption: things that&#39;s really great at the next

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:10.479
Caption: level is somebody who contributes to the

00:10:07.599 --> 00:10:12.578
Caption: team often it gets characterized as

00:10:10.479 --> 00:10:15.190
Caption: helping the team actually look great

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:17.948
Caption: like by that&#39;s a great team why and I

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:20.198
Caption: wonder wonder what&#39;s going on there at

00:10:17.948 --> 00:10:23.259
Caption: the next at the next point in Collins

00:10:20.198 --> 00:10:23.719
Caption: story is this idea of actually being a

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.609
Caption: good

00:10:23.719 --> 00:10:27.259
Caption: manager a good group manager you

00:10:25.609 --> 00:10:29.239
Caption: actually not only help the team look

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.280
Caption: good but you actually help the team get

00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:33.289
Caption: better you hope the team figure out how

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.450
Caption: to how to be really effective and that&#39;s

00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:37.459
Caption: sort of the next level you actually help

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.080
Caption: more than just your team but maybe your

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.300
Caption: division or your group of people and

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.250
Caption: then finally at a point where you&#39;re

00:10:41.299 --> 00:10:45.440
Caption: really able to help the organization

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:47.299
Caption: improve in lots of different ways and

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.390
Caption: I&#39;ve seen developers like this too at

00:10:47.299 --> 00:10:52.549
Caption: each stage of this process and usually

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.679
Caption: the things they produce as they get

00:10:52.549 --> 00:10:56.510
Caption: better as they get higher up in this

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:59.719
Caption: sort of stack that Collins talks about

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:01.970
Caption: the focus goes less and less on their

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:04.399
Caption: own interests or their own skills and

00:11:01.969 --> 00:11:07.669
Caption: more and more on their customers or

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.230
Caption: their stakeholders or some other aspect

00:11:07.669 --> 00:11:11.239
Caption: one of the keys to making something

00:11:09.229 --> 00:11:13.669
Caption: great a helping organization get to be

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:16.399
Caption: great it&#39;s figuring out who your

00:11:13.669 --> 00:11:17.899
Caption: audience is what it is what is it that

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.790
Caption: they really want what is it that they

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.290
Caption: really need and there are lots of

00:11:19.789 --> 00:11:25.309
Caption: organizations that are pretty good at

00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:27.829
Caption: this one company in particular that in

00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:29.659
Caption: IT space that has a lot of api&#39;s that&#39;s

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:33.260
Caption: pretty interesting is Spotify is anybody

00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:36.529
Caption: heard of the Spotify company they spend

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:39.739
Caption: a great deal of time focusing on how

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:41.360
Caption: they can help their individuals move up

00:11:39.739 --> 00:11:43.190
Caption: that kind of stack they don&#39;t they don&#39;t

00:11:41.359 --> 00:11:45.260
Caption: talk about level one through five liters

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:47.000
Caption: but they talk about this ability to

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.220
Caption: contribute and in their leadership

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.770
Caption: material they talk a lot about being

00:11:49.219 --> 00:11:53.779
Caption: humble as a leader so I think they&#39;re a

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.760
Caption: really great example if you&#39;re

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.220
Caption: interested in how to build a community

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:01.070
Caption: of developers and not just in your own

00:11:58.219 --> 00:12:03.769
Caption: team but cross team Spotify is a great

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:06.979
Caption: example and I think Spotify has a really

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:09.230
Caption: good reputation as a good IT company a

00:12:06.979 --> 00:12:10.940
Caption: good product company and they do a lot

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:12.679
Caption: of really interesting things in their in

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.720
Caption: their in their program so I would

00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:16.460
Caption: encourage you to check out Spotify

00:12:14.719 --> 00:12:18.529
Caption: there&#39;s lots of stuff online if you just

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.990
Caption: say scaling Spotify there&#39;s a series of

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:24.140
Caption: articles about how they run their

00:12:20.989 --> 00:12:27.469
Caption: organization how they get people to work

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:30.020
Caption: in teams so one of the things that that

00:12:27.469 --> 00:12:32.359
Caption: Colin says about this particular aspect

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:35.030
Caption: is it&#39;s about resolve and like

00:12:32.359 --> 00:12:36.588
Caption: determination like I&#39;m gonna do what the

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.240
Caption: company needs

00:12:36.588 --> 00:12:40.578
Caption: and I think all of us have probably

00:12:38.239 --> 00:12:43.128
Caption: experienced at one time or another

00:12:40.578 --> 00:12:45.559
Caption: that you&#39;ve got the company in mind but

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:47.720
Caption: maybe some of your colleagues some of

00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:50.028
Caption: your peers don&#39;t quite know that and you

00:12:47.719 --> 00:12:52.309
Caption: have to kind of press on anyway it gets

00:12:50.028 --> 00:12:55.008
Caption: frustrating when people don&#39;t listen you

00:12:52.309 --> 00:12:57.439
Caption: know you&#39;re trying to help but you can&#39;t

00:12:55.008 --> 00:12:59.479
Caption: quite get through and the people who end

00:12:57.439 --> 00:13:01.579
Caption: up really good at this are able to get

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:03.888
Caption: past that frustration and keep at it I

00:13:01.578 --> 00:13:05.989
Caption: was having a conversation with somebody

00:13:03.888 --> 00:13:08.148
Caption: that I&#39;d met a few years ago when I was

00:13:05.989 --> 00:13:10.128
Caption: down here and we&#39;re talking about how

00:13:08.148 --> 00:13:12.979
Caption: things get popular and things change and

00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:14.389
Caption: and people move on but there&#39;s always

00:13:12.979 --> 00:13:16.549
Caption: this feeling like yeah that&#39;s okay

00:13:14.388 --> 00:13:18.948
Caption: they&#39;ll be back we&#39;ll have the same set

00:13:16.549 --> 00:13:21.229
Caption: of problems I&#39;ll be here I&#39;ll be ready

00:13:18.948 --> 00:13:24.198
Caption: to help so with that that&#39;s a really big

00:13:21.229 --> 00:13:26.568
Caption: part of it and that leads to the second

00:13:24.198 --> 00:13:28.748
Caption: thing one another pattern that Collins

00:13:26.568 --> 00:13:33.349
Caption: talks about is he in his list he says

00:13:28.749 --> 00:13:34.910
Caption: first who then what and that&#39;s a that&#39;s

00:13:33.349 --> 00:13:37.278
Caption: a really important rule and the way he

00:13:34.909 --> 00:13:39.648
Caption: describes it is get the right people on

00:13:37.278 --> 00:13:41.378
Caption: the bus first then figure out where

00:13:39.648 --> 00:13:44.568
Caption: you&#39;re gonna go

00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:46.279
Caption: so really it&#39;s this notion that the

00:13:44.568 --> 00:13:47.989
Caption: people you have is actually more

00:13:46.278 --> 00:13:49.849
Caption: important than the direction you think

00:13:47.989 --> 00:13:53.628
Caption: you want to go and in fact the people

00:13:49.849 --> 00:13:55.789
Caption: you have will affect your journey how

00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:57.350
Caption: you&#39;re gonna get there and that&#39;s a

00:13:55.789 --> 00:13:58.969
Caption: really powerful thing it&#39;s very similar

00:13:57.349 --> 00:14:01.938
Caption: to the kind of things that Spotify talks

00:13:58.969 --> 00:14:04.159
Caption: about and a great a company that&#39;s great

00:14:01.939 --> 00:14:07.699
Caption: at this get the right people on the bus

00:14:04.159 --> 00:14:09.679
Caption: pattern is Netflix so Netflix has this

00:14:07.698 --> 00:14:11.688
Caption: reputation of spending a lot of time

00:14:09.679 --> 00:14:14.599
Caption: they say hiring from the top of the

00:14:11.689 --> 00:14:18.170
Caption: barrel finding the right people and so

00:14:14.599 --> 00:14:20.058
Caption: they had this thing about if somebody if

00:14:18.169 --> 00:14:22.458
Caption: you&#39;re if you it from a manager

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:25.100
Caption: standpoint if somebody was leaving would

00:14:22.458 --> 00:14:28.039
Caption: you really fight to keep them and if the

00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:30.289
Caption: answer is no and Netflix they say well

00:14:28.039 --> 00:14:31.729
Caption: then you should probably get that help

00:14:30.289 --> 00:14:33.409
Caption: that person find another place in the

00:14:31.729 --> 00:14:34.628
Caption: organization because they&#39;re not vital

00:14:33.409 --> 00:14:37.428
Caption: to what you&#39;re doing

00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:39.110
Caption: find people get the right people and

00:14:37.429 --> 00:14:41.000
Caption: then they&#39;ll help you figure out where

00:14:39.109 --> 00:14:43.219
Caption: to go

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.919
Caption: at Netflix they also tell their managers

00:14:43.219 --> 00:14:48.859
Caption: your job is not to tell them what to do

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:50.869
Caption: your job is to give them direction give

00:14:48.859 --> 00:14:52.688
Caption: them some help carry water ask them what

00:14:50.869 --> 00:14:55.909
Caption: they need because they&#39;re the experts

00:14:52.689 --> 00:14:58.100
Caption: they&#39;re the ones who know what to do so

00:14:55.909 --> 00:15:01.250
Caption: that&#39;s that same idea first who then

00:14:58.099 --> 00:15:04.099
Caption: what and a big part of that Collin says

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:06.588
Caption: is vision you need to give your smart

00:15:04.099 --> 00:15:08.750
Caption: people a vision they&#39;d be happy to work

00:15:06.588 --> 00:15:10.758
Caption: on something powerful and fantastic if

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:13.458
Caption: they had a sense that they knew where

00:15:10.758 --> 00:15:15.648
Caption: they were headed so so Netflix is a

00:15:13.458 --> 00:15:19.578
Caption: great example of this kind of element

00:15:15.648 --> 00:15:22.008
Caption: and Netflix has even to be more explicit

00:15:19.578 --> 00:15:25.039
Caption: about it their last release of their

00:15:22.008 --> 00:15:27.768
Caption: whole API set was actually designed to

00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:29.869
Caption: improve the experience for users on

00:15:27.768 --> 00:15:33.648
Caption: every single device they used to have a

00:15:29.869 --> 00:15:38.000
Caption: general API that all the devices use ps2

00:15:33.648 --> 00:15:40.878
Caption: and Xbox and Android and the browser and

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.088
Caption: iPhone they all use the same API but

00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:45.589
Caption: Netflix realized that you didn&#39;t have a

00:15:44.088 --> 00:15:47.058
Caption: really good experience and everyone it

00:15:45.588 --> 00:15:48.469
Caption: was all kind of generic it was kind of

00:15:47.059 --> 00:15:51.019
Caption: hard to get each one of those to really

00:15:48.469 --> 00:15:55.068
Caption: shine so they went out and they built a

00:15:51.018 --> 00:15:57.799
Caption: custom built interface API for every

00:15:55.068 --> 00:16:00.289
Caption: single device sometimes even different

00:15:57.799 --> 00:16:02.619
Caption: versions of the same device in order to

00:16:00.289 --> 00:16:06.078
Caption: make sure that that API experience was

00:16:02.619 --> 00:16:07.969
Caption: exactly fitting to the experience of

00:16:06.078 --> 00:16:10.278
Caption: programming on an iOS device or

00:16:07.969 --> 00:16:11.599
Caption: programming on the ps2 they actually

00:16:10.278 --> 00:16:14.419
Caption: created what they called experience

00:16:11.599 --> 00:16:16.008
Caption: api&#39;s because they were really focused

00:16:14.419 --> 00:16:18.318
Caption: on this vision about how to make sure

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:20.448
Caption: that they got just the right kind of

00:16:18.318 --> 00:16:22.568
Caption: experience on every device so that

00:16:20.448 --> 00:16:24.438
Caption: really helps a lot

00:16:22.568 --> 00:16:26.619
Caption: confronting the brutal confronting

00:16:24.439 --> 00:16:30.829
Caption: brutal facts this is one that&#39;s really

00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:32.419
Caption: hard and it&#39;s a great differentiator in

00:16:30.828 --> 00:16:35.869
Caption: the book he talks about a thing called

00:16:32.419 --> 00:16:37.128
Caption: the Stockdale paradox I&#39;m not sure if

00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:41.929
Caption: for a lot of people in the room would

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:46.819
Caption: actually know who James Stockdale was he

00:16:41.929 --> 00:16:50.659
Caption: was actually a Vietnam War prisoner of

00:16:46.818 --> 00:16:53.088
Caption: war and he was in there for quite a long

00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:54.079
Caption: time like seven years I think to say six

00:16:53.088 --> 00:16:57.140
Caption: or seven years

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:59.480
Caption: and he kept saying that he in order to

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:02.270
Caption: keep going in order to keep his spirits

00:16:59.479 --> 00:17:05.088
Caption: up he had to have faith that one day

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:07.369
Caption: he&#39;d be released but he couldn&#39;t let

00:17:05.088 --> 00:17:09.859
Caption: that faith blind him from the brutal

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:11.688
Caption: fact that he is currently a prisoner so

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:13.849
Caption: as long as he confronted the brutal

00:17:11.688 --> 00:17:16.039
Caption: facts every day he could cope but he

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:18.140
Caption: said there were people who kept saying

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.520
Caption: well next day we&#39;ll get released or next

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.448
Caption: day we&#39;ll get released and they would

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.650
Caption: get crushed over and over again so

00:17:22.448 --> 00:17:26.539
Caption: confronting the brutal facts actually

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.609
Caption: gives you power it gives you this

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.080
Caption: ability to do something about it if you

00:17:28.609 --> 00:17:31.459
Caption: just ignore if you just look at the

00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:34.369
Caption: bright side all the time it doesn&#39;t work

00:17:31.459 --> 00:17:37.549
Caption: I think one of the best examples of

00:17:34.369 --> 00:17:41.058
Caption: confronting the brutal facts came from a

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:43.790
Caption: sort of an odd case a random case by the

00:17:41.058 --> 00:17:47.449
Caption: I got a name is Steve Yeager is anybody

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:49.550
Caption: heard of the yeah mm oh the ug memo this

00:17:47.449 --> 00:17:52.130
Caption: is a great experience Steve Yeager was

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:55.730
Caption: hired away from Amazon to go work at

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:59.178
Caption: Google and when he came to Google Steve

00:17:55.729 --> 00:18:01.549
Caption: said that he was absolutely appalled at

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:04.909
Caption: what he didn&#39;t find what he thought was

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:06.230
Caption: going on and he his experience at Amazon

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.660
Caption: had told him that he should expect

00:18:06.229 --> 00:18:10.459
Caption: certain things that weren&#39;t there so and

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.590
Caption: then when the first week or two first

00:18:10.459 --> 00:18:14.869
Caption: couple of weeks he was there he sat down

00:18:12.589 --> 00:18:17.119
Caption: and wrote this rant wrote this memo

00:18:14.869 --> 00:18:19.670
Caption: about how Google is in big trouble

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:21.050
Caption: unless they start changing things you&#39;ve

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.420
Caption: got to face facts

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:25.670
Caption: you&#39;re gonna have your lunch handed to

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.200
Caption: you by Amazon if you don&#39;t do the

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:31.640
Caption: following things and let me give you

00:18:27.199 --> 00:18:32.989
Caption: some examples the funny thing was Steve

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.339
Caption: had only been there a few weeks he

00:18:32.989 --> 00:18:36.770
Caption: didn&#39;t quite understand how we in her

00:18:34.339 --> 00:18:39.859
Caption: office services work and what he did is

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:44.359
Caption: he wrote it and clicked and sent it to

00:18:39.859 --> 00:18:49.428
Caption: his public Google+ page so everybody had

00:18:44.359 --> 00:18:52.189
Caption: to see what was even better is Google

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:54.769
Caption: didn&#39;t fire him all right they said you

00:18:52.189 --> 00:18:56.449
Caption: know what you&#39;re right

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.000
Caption: you don&#39;t have to tell everybody else

00:18:56.449 --> 00:19:00.709
Caption: that but you&#39;re right

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.930
Caption: so and Steve has done this a couple of

00:19:00.709 --> 00:19:04.369
Caption: times before Steve is now since left

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.020
Caption: Google I I can&#39;t remember where he&#39;s

00:19:04.369 --> 00:19:07.219
Caption: gone next I don&#39;t know if anybody can

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.270
Caption: remind me I think it was in the last

00:19:07.219 --> 00:19:12.260
Caption: year where is it

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:14.869
Caption: what&#39;s it he&#39;s working on a game yeah so

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:17.630
Caption: even even it was he was leaving he wrote

00:19:14.869 --> 00:19:19.760
Caption: another one of these messages to the

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.260
Caption: company about what he likes about it

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.869
Caption: what he doesn&#39;t like about it and he was

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:26.060
Caption: also pretty brutal in that process but

00:19:23.869 --> 00:19:28.369
Caption: Steve has done a great job of making

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.200
Caption: that part of his superpower part of his

00:19:28.369 --> 00:19:32.689
Caption: character and it&#39;s become one of the

00:19:30.199 --> 00:19:35.029
Caption: things that helped the projects that he

00:19:32.689 --> 00:19:37.579
Caption: worked on at Google get really really

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:39.950
Caption: good because it&#39;s really based on this

00:19:37.579 --> 00:19:41.989
Caption: idea that unless you&#39;re brutally honest

00:19:39.949 --> 00:19:43.789
Caption: you&#39;re really not going to be able to

00:19:41.989 --> 00:19:45.650
Caption: make good decisions you&#39;re gonna be sort

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:48.290
Caption: of living in this dream kind of world

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:50.719
Caption: so creating great interfaces great api&#39;s

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.130
Caption: great products for companies really has

00:19:50.719 --> 00:19:56.479
Caption: a lot to do with this notion of being

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:58.849
Caption: really honest so the one that&#39;s most

00:19:56.479 --> 00:20:01.819
Caption: peculiar to me in in reading Jim&#39;s book

00:19:58.849 --> 00:20:03.890
Caption: is this idea of the Hedgehog so there&#39;s

00:20:01.819 --> 00:20:05.689
Caption: a story about this Hedgehog and this Fox

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.579
Caption: and that the Hedgehog is able to

00:20:05.689 --> 00:20:10.129
Caption: outsmart the Fox and it&#39;s primarily

00:20:07.579 --> 00:20:14.179
Caption: because the Hedgehog has everything to

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:16.849
Caption: lose and the Fox has not much to gain in

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.560
Caption: their in their fight between them so the

00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:21.679
Caption: way that Jim talks about it he says

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:22.820
Caption: there&#39;s this confluence of things what

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.550
Caption: is it that you&#39;re really passionate

00:20:22.819 --> 00:20:28.130
Caption: about what do you think you can be best

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:30.200
Caption: at in the world not just best at in this

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:34.130
Caption: neighborhood but what&#39;s gonna make you

00:20:30.199 --> 00:20:36.349
Caption: really powerful really unique and what&#39;s

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:39.489
Caption: the driving resource what&#39;s the driving

00:20:36.349 --> 00:20:42.349
Caption: source of what you do this is a great

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:43.939
Caption: way to think about products this is a

00:20:42.349 --> 00:20:46.549
Caption: great way to think about what your

00:20:43.939 --> 00:20:48.049
Caption: organization has what do you pack what

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.440
Caption: is your organization passionate about

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:52.850
Caption: what do you do that nobody else does and

00:20:50.439 --> 00:20:55.369
Caption: paying attention to who pays your bills

00:20:52.849 --> 00:20:56.579
Caption: how this is really gonna gonna pay off

00:20:55.369 --> 00:20:58.229
Caption: in the end

00:20:56.579 --> 00:21:00.179
Caption: and he talks about this sort of

00:20:58.229 --> 00:21:02.160
Caption: confluence of these three things is

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:05.070
Caption: actually that sweet spot if you can

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.440
Caption: operate inside that zone nobody can beat

00:21:05.069 --> 00:21:09.000
Caption: you one of the things we learned is we

00:21:07.439 --> 00:21:12.599
Caption: talked to lots of different companies

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.939
Caption: about how they decide what&#39;s important

00:21:12.599 --> 00:21:17.219
Caption: in how they invest their time and energy

00:21:14.939 --> 00:21:19.199
Caption: one of the things we saw over and over

00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:21.510
Caption: again as companies like Netflix and

00:21:19.199 --> 00:21:24.659
Caption: Amazon in Google and Microsoft and

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:28.349
Caption: Facebook they almost always have some

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:30.750
Caption: investment in creating like an internal

00:21:28.349 --> 00:21:33.510
Caption: set of tools or an internal set of

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:35.280
Caption: processes that really play on their

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:38.070
Caption: biggest value or their biggest

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.650
Caption: superpower their their biggest passion

00:21:38.069 --> 00:21:43.439
Caption: or principle at Netflix the most

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:45.000
Caption: important thing for Netflix is that the

00:21:43.439 --> 00:21:46.409
Caption: system never go down that when you&#39;re

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.750
Caption: watching a show you never get

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:50.430
Caption: interrupted it doesn&#39;t stop you don&#39;t

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.079
Caption: get the little buffer thing that&#39;s the

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:54.090
Caption: most important principle for them and

00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:57.149
Caption: they&#39;ll do just about anything to pull

00:21:54.089 --> 00:21:59.130
Caption: that off in order to make that work they

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.989
Caption: have to have a super resilient system

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:03.000
Caption: they have to have a system that&#39;s even

00:22:00.989 --> 00:22:05.880
Caption: smart enough that when something doesn&#39;t

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.369
Caption: quite work in one region because they

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.349
Caption: use Amazon&#39;s regions if it doesn&#39;t work

00:22:08.369 --> 00:22:12.510
Caption: here in Australia then they&#39;ll switch to

00:22:10.349 --> 00:22:13.049
Caption: this to Singapore servers to actually

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.560
Caption: deliver

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:18.720
Caption: deliver streaming video here in on this

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.730
Caption: continent so they work really hard to

00:22:18.719 --> 00:22:23.250
Caption: make their system reliable so they

00:22:20.729 --> 00:22:25.439
Caption: invested thousands of hours I suspect

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:28.170
Caption: tens of hundreds of thousands of dollars

00:22:25.439 --> 00:22:30.029
Caption: you know in a way to make sure that

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:31.650
Caption: their system is reliable does anybody

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:34.190
Caption: know what that big investment is what

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:37.020
Caption: did they build what did what was it

00:22:34.189 --> 00:22:39.899
Caption: chaos monkey and chaos army they built

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:42.690
Caption: all this software to to make sure that

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.969
Caption: they build better software and that&#39;s

00:22:42.689 --> 00:22:47.250
Caption: why they&#39;re so great at this because

00:22:44.969 --> 00:22:48.929
Caption: that&#39;s what they did at Amazon they have

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.520
Caption: a different value but Amazon their value

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:53.070
Caption: is they want to create as many products

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.890
Caption: as possible minimum viable products and

00:22:53.069 --> 00:22:57.419
Caption: get them up and launched and kill off

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.579
Caption: the ones that don&#39;t make sense they want

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.260
Caption: to increase their averages now a lot

00:22:59.579 --> 00:23:03.569
Caption: more tries means they could find more

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:05.219
Caption: products so they spend thousands of

00:23:03.569 --> 00:23:07.199
Caption: hours and lots and lots of money on a

00:23:05.219 --> 00:23:08.849
Caption: system where if I get an idea I come

00:23:07.199 --> 00:23:11.069
Caption: into the office

00:23:08.849 --> 00:23:13.140
Caption: Monday I can press a button that can

00:23:11.069 --> 00:23:15.689
Caption: fill out a form and I get a new product

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.969
Caption: build I get a couple of ec2 instances I

00:23:15.689 --> 00:23:20.369
Caption: get a Giri list I get a build pipeline

00:23:17.969 --> 00:23:21.839
Caption: there&#39;s a little mailing alert list

00:23:20.369 --> 00:23:23.670
Caption: that&#39;s set up all the things up

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:25.739
Caption: templates all this stuff ready for me to

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:28.800
Caption: go in a repo and then the last step it

00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:32.429
Caption: tells my boss and I love that that&#39;s the

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.989
Caption: last step right one of the things I

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.610
Caption: think we learned from from Amazon I

00:23:33.989 --> 00:23:38.699
Caption: think was from somebody at Amazon is if

00:23:35.609 --> 00:23:41.400
Caption: you want to be great stop asking for

00:23:38.699 --> 00:23:42.809
Caption: permission right so they build their

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.700
Caption: system so that if you&#39;ve got a great

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:48.180
Caption: idea we want you to start on it right

00:23:44.699 --> 00:23:52.019
Caption: away and just let me know now eventually

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:53.340
Caption: if I do this a few times and not much is

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.349
Caption: happening like I start a new one every

00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:57.479
Caption: week my boss might come to my cube and

00:23:55.349 --> 00:24:00.299
Caption: she&#39;ll say you&#39;re gonna complete

00:23:57.479 --> 00:24:02.309
Caption: something a unit and now so that&#39;s what

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:05.070
Caption: they do right but I don&#39;t have to ask to

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:06.780
Caption: start do we know this Etsy this Etsy

00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:09.029
Caption: shop the sort of online store for

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:11.790
Caption: crafters at Etsy they&#39;re super power is

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:14.000
Caption: releasing they released about 40 times a

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:17.010
Caption: day to production that&#39;s pretty amazing

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.770
Caption: and what they did is they built this

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:21.719
Caption: entire system to let that let just about

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.820
Caption: anybody in their company released a

00:24:21.719 --> 00:24:26.459
Caption: production they have that sort of a

00:24:23.819 --> 00:24:27.899
Caption: protocol on a simple change like maybe I

00:24:26.459 --> 00:24:29.579
Caption: need to get at least one other person to

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.320
Caption: sign off and agree and then we need to

00:24:29.579 --> 00:24:32.880
Caption: run the tests there&#39;s a thing called

00:24:31.319 --> 00:24:34.469
Caption: writing an assertion like how this is

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.660
Caption: going to help and then that&#39;s all

00:24:34.469 --> 00:24:38.909
Caption: automated and eventually it gets sent

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:41.460
Caption: out to some small part of the or of my

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:43.260
Caption: user base they segment the base but

00:24:41.459 --> 00:24:46.109
Caption: again they that&#39;s their superpower so

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.790
Caption: they spent time on that so every one of

00:24:46.109 --> 00:24:49.380
Caption: us work at a company where there is

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.570
Caption: actually this sort of super thing that

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:53.790
Caption: would make us great and companies that

00:24:51.569 --> 00:24:56.369
Caption: spend time and money making that

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:58.830
Caption: powerful making that easy for everyone

00:24:56.369 --> 00:25:01.410
Caption: and they&#39;re actually engaging in this

00:24:58.829 --> 00:25:03.630
Caption: Hedgehog idea a company that I think is

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:06.630
Caption: pretty good at this is a company called

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:09.810
Caption: Twilio Twilio is their only product is

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:11.609
Caption: an API and they that it&#39;s basically SMS

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:13.440
Caption: messaging or now they think they do some

00:25:11.609 --> 00:25:16.109
Caption: voice and some other things and what&#39;s

00:25:13.439 --> 00:25:19.109
Caption: cool about Twilio is toyou doesn&#39;t

00:25:16.109 --> 00:25:21.449
Caption: actually send any SMS messages they

00:25:19.109 --> 00:25:22.269
Caption: purchase service from AT&amp;T and other

00:25:21.449 --> 00:25:23.949
Caption: phone companies in

00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:27.458
Caption: Telstra and so and so far they purchased

00:25:23.949 --> 00:25:30.729
Caption: that what they built is a great API and

00:25:27.458 --> 00:25:33.848
Caption: they also know that developers are their

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:36.789
Caption: secret sauce so their whole program the

00:25:33.848 --> 00:25:39.038
Caption: way they talk about it is that you can

00:25:36.788 --> 00:25:41.138
Caption: do whatever you want to do without a lot

00:25:39.038 --> 00:25:42.848
Caption: of effort and we&#39;re here to make that

00:25:41.139 --> 00:25:45.879
Caption: possible for you that&#39;s sort of their

00:25:42.848 --> 00:25:47.979
Caption: power the whole Twilio the whole idea

00:25:45.879 --> 00:25:49.989
Caption: about how they design their api is and

00:25:47.979 --> 00:25:52.269
Caption: how they document them and all that has

00:25:49.989 --> 00:25:54.549
Caption: this personality of like we&#39;re gonna

00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:56.109
Caption: help you with your passion and I&#39;ve

00:25:54.548 --> 00:25:57.998
Caption: worked with some Twilio evangelist in

00:25:56.109 --> 00:26:00.940
Caption: the past and they have that same kind of

00:25:57.999 --> 00:26:02.679
Caption: passion about how what they can do what

00:26:00.939 --> 00:26:04.088
Caption: they do can help us in so many other

00:26:02.678 --> 00:26:04.838
Caption: ways so I think they do a really good

00:26:04.088 --> 00:26:08.109
Caption: job at that

00:26:04.838 --> 00:26:09.908
Caption: and it&#39;s really in order to stay on top

00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:12.489
Caption: you really need to be working in that

00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:14.409
Caption: little passion zone it might you might

00:26:12.489 --> 00:26:16.149
Caption: turn out to be really good at something

00:26:14.409 --> 00:26:18.070
Caption: better than most of the peers around you

00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:19.718
Caption: inside an organization but if you&#39;re not

00:26:18.069 --> 00:26:22.058
Caption: really passionate about it it&#39;s possible

00:26:19.718 --> 00:26:24.249
Caption: that somebody else will come along that

00:26:22.058 --> 00:26:26.408
Caption: will be even more interested in it so

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:29.588
Caption: passion is really a key driver for

00:26:26.409 --> 00:26:31.269
Caption: reaching this greatness and the other

00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:33.249
Caption: side of that passion that willingness to

00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:35.229
Caption: take time or that that that willingness

00:26:33.249 --> 00:26:37.899
Caption: to dig into it is this notion of

00:26:35.229 --> 00:26:40.298
Caption: discipline and we&#39;ve seen a lot of this

00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:42.639
Caption: Collins calls it a culture of discipline

00:26:40.298 --> 00:26:44.859
Caption: this ability to get in there and do the

00:26:42.639 --> 00:26:47.529
Caption: things that you need to do every single

00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:49.928
Caption: day he has the example of called rinsing

00:26:47.529 --> 00:26:51.759
Caption: the cottage cheese if you really want to

00:26:49.928 --> 00:26:53.018
Caption: make really good cottage cheese it turns

00:26:51.759 --> 00:26:55.119
Caption: out there&#39;s this step where you have to

00:26:53.019 --> 00:26:57.098
Caption: rinse it a lot to get all of the

00:26:55.119 --> 00:26:59.019
Caption: bitterness out and actually get it to

00:26:57.098 --> 00:27:02.109
Caption: you know taste really good and fresh I&#39;m

00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:04.570
Caption: not really a fan of cottage cheese but I

00:27:02.109 --> 00:27:07.088
Caption: understand the concept but it turns out

00:27:04.569 --> 00:27:10.778
Caption: it&#39;s a dull and boring and annoying and

00:27:07.088 --> 00:27:13.119
Caption: dirty and and yucky job but if you want

00:27:10.779 --> 00:27:15.820
Caption: to be great you have to do that and

00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:18.909
Caption: that&#39;s a really big part of doing things

00:27:15.819 --> 00:27:21.788
Caption: well is doing the stuff that isn&#39;t it

00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:23.859
Caption: isn&#39;t romantic that isn&#39;t exciting that

00:27:21.788 --> 00:27:26.168
Caption: isn&#39;t interesting but you do it over and

00:27:23.859 --> 00:27:27.578
Caption: over I worked with a gentleman for a

00:27:26.168 --> 00:27:30.128
Caption: while by the name of Steve collab Nick

00:27:27.578 --> 00:27:32.319
Caption: Steve is a great evangelist a great

00:27:30.129 --> 00:27:35.010
Caption: speaker on api&#39;s and he&#39;s have done

00:27:32.319 --> 00:27:36.269
Caption: involved in a handful of standards

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.829
Caption: he worked for a company for balanced

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:41.580
Caption: payments for a while and he helped build

00:27:37.829 --> 00:27:43.589
Caption: their API program and he said the most

00:27:41.579 --> 00:27:46.709
Caption: important thing that he was able to do

00:27:43.589 --> 00:27:48.449
Caption: there is help them figure out how to how

00:27:46.709 --> 00:27:51.089
Caption: to be disciplined how to do things over

00:27:48.449 --> 00:27:53.039
Caption: and over and over again he kind of

00:27:51.089 --> 00:27:55.559
Caption: invented his own sort of test driven

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:58.530
Caption: development notion and sort of infused

00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:01.020
Caption: it not just into the way that they wrote

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:03.300
Caption: tests or wrote code but actually the way

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:06.089
Caption: they they deployed their entire system

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.680
Caption: and he got everybody really excited

00:28:06.089 --> 00:28:10.199
Caption: about paying attention to the small

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:11.910
Caption: details and doing it over and over and

00:28:10.199 --> 00:28:14.549
Caption: over again one of the things that that

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:17.640
Caption: he talks about is the idea of is making

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:20.160
Caption: the boring stuff easy so you can get on

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.839
Caption: to something else but he was he was

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.460
Caption: really really good at that and balanced

00:28:21.839 --> 00:28:26.099
Caption: payments I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re

00:28:23.459 --> 00:28:28.199
Caption: actually I think they got purchased but

00:28:26.099 --> 00:28:31.079
Caption: they were one of the first sort of open

00:28:28.199 --> 00:28:33.929
Caption: banking API or open money management

00:28:31.079 --> 00:28:35.699
Caption: api&#39;s about three or four years ago

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:37.950
Caption: before it got to be a big thing and they

00:28:35.699 --> 00:28:41.579
Caption: sort of led the way on how that&#39;s done

00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:44.159
Caption: and the way Collins talks about this is

00:28:41.579 --> 00:28:46.049
Caption: when you take that discipline and you

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.330
Caption: marry that to that passion and that sort

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:49.980
Caption: of creative idea then you can really

00:28:48.329 --> 00:28:51.809
Caption: start creating something great and I

00:28:49.979 --> 00:28:53.640
Caption: think balanced payment did that really

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:55.110
Caption: really well I think it&#39;s the same kind

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.479
Caption: of thing that Twilio does they&#39;re great

00:28:55.109 --> 00:28:59.160
Caption: at details as well so creating something

00:28:57.479 --> 00:29:01.919
Caption: great is often just talking about

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:04.200
Caption: discipline and then there&#39;s this idea of

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:07.260
Caption: technology accelerators now from Collins

00:29:04.199 --> 00:29:09.689
Caption: standpoint in the late 80s technology

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:12.449
Caption: was this sort of extra thing it was not

00:29:09.689 --> 00:29:15.029
Caption: really infused with the same kind of

00:29:12.449 --> 00:29:17.819
Caption: purpose and meaning that we have today I

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:19.469
Caption: have a great story uh I think Gregor

00:29:17.819 --> 00:29:20.250
Caption: hoppy will be here soon he&#39;ll be coming

00:29:19.469 --> 00:29:22.919
Caption: back here soon

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:26.130
Caption: Gregor had moved from Google to Allianz

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:29.520
Caption: insurance and he said he was kind of

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:30.839
Caption: startled at Allianz he said they would

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.820
Caption: be talking about something that we&#39;re

00:29:30.839 --> 00:29:34.409
Caption: gonna work on a new banking product or a

00:29:32.819 --> 00:29:36.719
Caption: new entry there was an insurance company

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:39.239
Caption: and somebody would say at Allianz you

00:29:36.719 --> 00:29:42.239
Caption: know we should go talk to IT about that

00:29:39.239 --> 00:29:44.050
Caption: and Gregor said you know at Google

00:29:42.239 --> 00:29:46.559
Caption: nobody says that

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:51.040
Caption: they don&#39;t say we should go talk to IT

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:53.680
Caption: why is that because Google is IT right

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:56.200
Caption: so Google IT is the product IT is not

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.119
Caption: this added thing it&#39;s not this extra

00:29:56.199 --> 00:30:00.639
Caption: thing we don&#39;t apply technology to

00:29:58.119 --> 00:30:04.930
Caption: whatever the idea is Google is

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:07.839
Caption: technology so I think Colin&#39;s a view on

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:09.730
Caption: this is actually pretty good so he talks

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:12.549
Caption: about using technology to be the

00:30:09.729 --> 00:30:14.410
Caption: accelerator pick your technologies so

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.960
Caption: they get you further on to where you

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:19.300
Caption: want to be and what you want to do in

00:30:16.959 --> 00:30:21.939
Caption: sort of the back story er the hidden

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:24.430
Caption: message of this is don&#39;t pick technology

00:30:21.939 --> 00:30:26.500
Caption: just for technology&#39;s sake don&#39;t become

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:28.060
Caption: a camp follower don&#39;t just pick the

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.040
Caption: latest thing because it&#39;s the latest

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:33.130
Caption: thing figure out what it is you really

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.810
Caption: need you really want and do that and

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.729
Caption: that can be challenging for us who are

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:39.430
Caption: in the business of knowing what the

00:30:36.729 --> 00:30:41.709
Caption: latest and the greatest is it turns out

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:43.540
Caption: that all the newest stuff is not always

00:30:41.709 --> 00:30:46.059
Caption: applicable to all the things that we

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:48.070
Caption: might do and maybe just a few teams need

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.340
Caption: to be focusing on graph QL and the rest

00:30:48.069 --> 00:30:53.079
Caption: of the company needs to be focusing on

00:30:50.339 --> 00:30:55.479
Caption: you know rest style or crud style maybe

00:30:53.079 --> 00:30:57.369
Caption: we have to maintain a really important

00:30:55.479 --> 00:30:58.979
Caption: investment in our soap services because

00:30:57.369 --> 00:31:01.630
Caption: that&#39;s where most of our partners are

00:30:58.979 --> 00:31:03.400
Caption: using the technology that&#39;s appropriate

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:05.800
Caption: in order to meet the needs of that

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:08.859
Caption: particular audience can be really the

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:11.770
Caption: the best way to go and that&#39;s a lot of

00:31:08.859 --> 00:31:14.349
Caption: what Amazon is like from what we were

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:16.420
Caption: able to learn about Amazon&#39;s AWS an

00:31:14.349 --> 00:31:19.750
Caption: internal program and their api&#39;s and how

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:22.119
Caption: they build it they&#39;re amazingly agnostic

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:25.839
Caption: about a particular technology or a

00:31:22.119 --> 00:31:29.020
Caption: particular style of service or back-end

00:31:25.839 --> 00:31:31.659
Caption: or open source they kind of don&#39;t care

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:34.869
Caption: in their organisation if your team wants

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:39.729
Caption: to use Kafka fine they don&#39;t want to use

00:31:34.869 --> 00:31:41.290
Caption: it fine if you want to use some sequel

00:31:39.729 --> 00:31:43.299
Caption: light or you want to use my sequel

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:46.119
Caption: that&#39;s fine if you want to use this

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:48.610
Caption: editor that editor all they really care

00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:51.699
Caption: about is what comes out of the system

00:31:48.609 --> 00:31:54.250
Caption: they say as long as your group produces

00:31:51.699 --> 00:31:55.630
Caption: in the same interoperable format that we

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:57.369
Caption: have that&#39;s what they have a huge

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.880
Caption: discipline on is about the way things

00:31:57.369 --> 00:32:00.729
Caption: work in

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:02.319
Caption: operably then you&#39;re just it&#39;s just fine

00:32:00.729 --> 00:32:04.780
Caption: with us you do whatever you want to do

00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:07.179
Caption: they don&#39;t really care so they don&#39;t

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:09.400
Caption: really get excited about any new thing

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.450
Caption: that comes along the other thing though

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.560
Caption: that&#39;s really interesting and this is

00:32:10.449 --> 00:32:15.309
Caption: one of the reasons I picked they&#39;re

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:18.750
Caption: they&#39;re API for their gateway is they&#39;re

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:21.300
Caption: more than willing to try a technology

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:23.439
Caption: the API gateway actually uses a

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:25.060
Caption: messaging format called Hale or

00:32:23.439 --> 00:32:28.089
Caption: hypertext application language has

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:31.660
Caption: anybody heard of hell before so Amazon

00:32:28.089 --> 00:32:35.679
Caption: has been really willing to try something

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:38.170
Caption: out in matter of fact in perfect Amazon

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:41.080
Caption: style they had a an app streaming API it

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:43.119
Caption: had to do with some of their internal

00:32:41.079 --> 00:32:46.209
Caption: management for their workspaces and some

00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:48.189
Caption: some app space applications and when

00:32:46.209 --> 00:32:51.000
Caption: they release that API they released it

00:32:48.189 --> 00:32:53.829
Caption: using a traditional sort of crud style

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.270
Caption: interface and a Hal interface they

00:32:53.829 --> 00:32:58.659
Caption: actually released it with two interfaces

00:32:55.270 --> 00:33:00.640
Caption: and they watched to see which one people

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.890
Caption: used and how it worked and how easy they

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.589
Caption: were to maintain and what they learned

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:07.839
Caption: from that is that hey this is how thing

00:33:05.589 --> 00:33:09.909
Caption: actually works pretty good so this net

00:33:07.839 --> 00:33:12.130
Caption: this API that they released they decided

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:14.380
Caption: to only release with a Hal interface

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:16.000
Caption: right so they did a little experimenting

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.010
Caption: they got some results and they said hey

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.250
Caption: people are interested I&#39;ll use this

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:23.650
Caption: technology now I can I can bet that if

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:26.349
Caption: this doesn&#39;t work well they&#39;ll just

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:28.630
Caption: switch it to whatever works because

00:33:26.349 --> 00:33:32.140
Caption: that&#39;s really what they do for them a

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:34.630
Caption: technology a format a library all these

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.609
Caption: other things are just an accelerator to

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:38.199
Caption: their real goal which is to help people

00:33:36.609 --> 00:33:40.599
Caption: solve their problems that&#39;s what they&#39;re

00:33:38.199 --> 00:33:42.729
Caption: passionate about the other thing that I

00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:44.559
Caption: love this I love this line culture eats

00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:47.650
Caption: strategy for breakfast this is actually

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:50.290
Caption: a version of a line from from Peter

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:52.690
Caption: Drucker another business management

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:55.869
Caption: person and he said and I love that they

00:33:52.689 --> 00:33:57.879
Caption: added and technology for lunch right and

00:33:55.869 --> 00:34:01.030
Caption: then you&#39;re then it actually eats the

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.609
Caption: whole thing so it&#39;s okay to use

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:06.400
Caption: technology as an accelerator but don&#39;t

00:34:03.609 --> 00:34:08.168
Caption: become just the technology and here he

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:10.570
Caption: is he talks about a thoughtless reliance

00:34:08.168 --> 00:34:12.879
Caption: just makes it a liability

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:15.130
Caption: so that&#39;s another big thing that I see

00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:17.679
Caption: organizations struggle with and that is

00:34:15.129 --> 00:34:19.539
Caption: well we&#39;re gonna convert a whole bunch

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:23.649
Caption: of things and we&#39;re gonna actually use

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:27.100
Caption: this brand-new open-source thing to do

00:34:23.649 --> 00:34:29.409
Caption: all of it and that means that if the

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:31.450
Caption: open-source thing doesn&#39;t work out our

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:33.729
Caption: whole investment in that thing is not

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:35.709
Caption: going to work out in others they don&#39;t

00:34:33.729 --> 00:34:37.570
Caption: decouple the technology from the goal if

00:34:35.709 --> 00:34:39.609
Caption: we want to migrate something we&#39;re gonna

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:41.770
Caption: migrate it and we&#39;re gonna apply this

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:44.620
Caption: technology that&#39;s pretty good but if it

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:46.390
Caption: turns out you become stuck you can

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.460
Caption: actually bet the whole company on one

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:50.529
Caption: particular thing that turns out to be a

00:34:48.459 --> 00:34:52.389
Caption: liability and that&#39;s where I was really

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:55.209
Caption: impressed about how Amazon would

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:57.069
Caption: actually use multiple pieces of

00:34:55.209 --> 00:34:59.260
Caption: technology or multiple the samples of

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:01.870
Caption: this and see what&#39;s going to happen

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:04.929
Caption: that&#39;s really a thing that I think talks

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:06.430
Caption: about greatness then the last one in his

00:35:04.929 --> 00:35:09.819
Caption: list is a thing called a flywheel

00:35:06.429 --> 00:35:12.159
Caption: principle it has this added effect of

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.530
Caption: small initiatives of small efforts if I

00:35:12.159 --> 00:35:16.689
Caption: push it just a little it gets easier and

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:18.610
Caption: easier and easier as I start to push it

00:35:16.689 --> 00:35:20.709
Caption: until pretty soon it&#39;s easy to keep it

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:23.830
Caption: going it&#39;s easy to get it going really

00:35:20.709 --> 00:35:25.869
Caption: fast most of us who work on development

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:28.150
Caption: we actually experience a version of this

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:30.280
Caption: flywheel thing in our heads right you

00:35:28.149 --> 00:35:32.020
Caption: show up you sit down at your terminal

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.550
Caption: you clear your head you&#39;re about to get

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.560
Caption: ready it takes some time to start

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.689
Caption: reading some documentation looking at

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.979
Caption: code that you checked in yesterday maybe

00:35:37.689 --> 00:35:41.199
Caption: some other things and then pretty soon

00:35:38.979 --> 00:35:43.989
Caption: you start get going you sort of get into

00:35:41.199 --> 00:35:45.579
Caption: headspace and it works really well and

00:35:43.989 --> 00:35:47.110
Caption: you can actually be very effective at

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.850
Caption: this and things are working really

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:51.100
Caption: really great until somebody stops by

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:53.560
Caption: your cubicle right and then they break

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:55.120
Caption: your concentration in a second yeah

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.469
Caption: whatever bah blah blah we can do lunch

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:59.440
Caption: and so on so forth and then you turn

00:35:56.469 --> 00:36:01.270
Caption: around you got to start again you know

00:35:59.439 --> 00:36:02.530
Caption: start working up working up and working

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:04.600
Caption: on the finally you get into headspace

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:06.150
Caption: again and then the phone rings right or

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.710
Caption: something

00:36:06.149 --> 00:36:12.399
Caption: Microsoft figured that out this out very

00:36:08.709 --> 00:36:14.260
Caption: early on at Microsoft they had you know

00:36:12.399 --> 00:36:15.969
Caption: hundreds and hundreds of developers and

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.889
Caption: they wanted to make sure that they could

00:36:15.969 --> 00:36:19.429
Caption: focus and keep their focus for an

00:36:17.889 --> 00:36:21.919
Caption: extended period of time

00:36:19.429 --> 00:36:25.969
Caption: so they built buildings where everyone

00:36:21.919 --> 00:36:28.038
Caption: had an office with a door and it&#39;s just

00:36:25.969 --> 00:36:31.219
Caption: I&#39;ve been here it&#39;s just rows and rows

00:36:28.039 --> 00:36:34.099
Caption: of these tiny little offices with the

00:36:31.219 --> 00:36:36.858
Caption: same door and there&#39;s there&#39;s actually a

00:36:34.099 --> 00:36:39.410
Caption: piece of you know a small glass window

00:36:36.858 --> 00:36:41.179
Caption: on the side the door is solid and it&#39;s

00:36:39.409 --> 00:36:43.788
Caption: just row upon row upon row and you can

00:36:41.179 --> 00:36:46.788
Caption: get lost it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s really kind

00:36:43.789 --> 00:36:49.309
Caption: of kind of weird but the thing was the

00:36:46.789 --> 00:36:51.619
Caption: rule is if you close your door you don&#39;t

00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:53.719
Caption: want to be disturbed people can&#39;t stop

00:36:51.618 --> 00:36:55.909
Caption: by people can&#39;t aren&#39;t supposed to knock

00:36:53.719 --> 00:36:57.709
Caption: on the door and that&#39;s your headspace

00:36:55.909 --> 00:36:58.848
Caption: that&#39;s you are time they also have this

00:36:57.709 --> 00:37:01.669
Caption: weird thing where you can decorate

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:03.650
Caption: inside there any way you wish we&#39;re guys

00:37:01.669 --> 00:37:05.479
Caption: that had like blacklight posters and

00:37:03.649 --> 00:37:07.429
Caption: beanbag chairs and lots of other things

00:37:05.479 --> 00:37:10.729
Caption: and there&#39;s not a lot of room I mean the

00:37:07.429 --> 00:37:12.139
Caption: office is like maybe that big you know a

00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:14.329
Caption: lot of them had standup desks or

00:37:12.139 --> 00:37:16.399
Caption: whatever but they sort of understood

00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:20.299
Caption: this notion of flywheel of making things

00:37:16.399 --> 00:37:22.578
Caption: easier a great example of flywheel is

00:37:20.299 --> 00:37:24.170
Caption: are things like continuous delivery and

00:37:22.579 --> 00:37:25.970
Caption: continuous integration and I love this

00:37:24.169 --> 00:37:29.328
Caption: quote from Jess humble about

00:37:25.969 --> 00:37:31.279
Caption: incrementalism if it hurts do it more

00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:33.109
Caption: often do it more frequently bring the

00:37:31.279 --> 00:37:35.510
Caption: pain forward this is a really great

00:37:33.108 --> 00:37:38.838
Caption: message from this continuous delivery

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:40.279
Caption: world a handful of customers I work with

00:37:38.839 --> 00:37:42.190
Caption: are still in this notion where they

00:37:40.279 --> 00:37:44.479
Caption: released a production four times a year

00:37:42.189 --> 00:37:47.298
Caption: means you only got four shots in a year

00:37:44.479 --> 00:37:49.279
Caption: to get it right and boy if you don&#39;t get

00:37:47.299 --> 00:37:50.959
Caption: it right on one of them now you&#39;re you

00:37:49.279 --> 00:37:52.429
Caption: kind of really screwed I think you have

00:37:50.959 --> 00:37:54.709
Caption: to back everything up and a lot of

00:37:52.429 --> 00:37:57.618
Caption: people are upset but if you do this kind

00:37:54.709 --> 00:37:59.868
Caption: of continuous delivery experience if you

00:37:57.618 --> 00:38:02.598
Caption: do this more often you can you can

00:37:59.868 --> 00:38:05.149
Caption: actually you get 20 shots a year 25

00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:06.010
Caption: shots a year if you&#39;re at sea you get 40

00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:08.538
Caption: times a day

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:10.520
Caption: right so it&#39;s really amazing so what

00:38:08.539 --> 00:38:13.520
Caption: happens is if you can just do a little

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:15.739
Caption: ink make it a little bit better then the

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.969
Caption: next time it&#39;s even easier to make it a

00:38:15.739 --> 00:38:18.529
Caption: little bit better and a little bit

00:38:16.969 --> 00:38:20.899
Caption: better and that&#39;s a lot of what

00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:22.939
Caption: continuous delivery is about it&#39;s about

00:38:20.899 --> 00:38:24.949
Caption: taking things in very very small chunks

00:38:22.939 --> 00:38:27.139
Caption: to make it easy this is how John all

00:38:24.949 --> 00:38:29.959
Caption: spot from Etsy actually explains this

00:38:27.139 --> 00:38:31.819
Caption: notion of making it easy if you&#39;ve only

00:38:29.959 --> 00:38:33.560
Caption: got four times a year it&#39;s

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:35.330
Caption: big bet every single time we&#39;re gonna

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.770
Caption: tell people you can&#39;t go on vacation you

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:38.330
Caption: have to come in on the weekend it&#39;s

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.979
Caption: gonna be a really big thing because

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.930
Caption: we&#39;re in there&#39;s shot the old system

00:38:39.979 --> 00:38:43.580
Caption: down Friday at midnight we&#39;re gonna have

00:38:41.929 --> 00:38:44.959
Caption: it all back up and running by Saturday

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.370
Caption: and hopefully you have all day as Sunday

00:38:44.959 --> 00:38:49.399
Caption: to fix the bugs and then everybody comes

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:52.040
Caption: in Lindy it&#39;s great and it&#39;s a huge

00:38:49.399 --> 00:38:54.289
Caption: disruption of everyone&#39;s lives and the

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.669
Caption: thing is if it screws up you&#39;re really

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:58.489
Caption: kind of cooked for another couple of

00:38:55.669 --> 00:39:00.639
Caption: months but if you do it in small

00:38:58.489 --> 00:39:03.139
Caption: increments there are lots of advantages

00:39:00.639 --> 00:39:05.479
Caption: so first of all every one of these big

00:39:03.139 --> 00:39:08.479
Caption: packages packages maybe they have 150

00:39:05.479 --> 00:39:10.010
Caption: changes in them mathematically that

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:11.659
Caption: means there&#39;s about eleven thousand

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:14.840
Caption: possible things that can go wrong just

00:39:11.659 --> 00:39:17.059
Caption: inside that package not counting how it

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.910
Caption: affects everyone else right but if I can

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:22.130
Caption: make it a smaller package maybe there&#39;s

00:39:19.909 --> 00:39:23.869
Caption: only ten things in it now there&#39;s only

00:39:22.129 --> 00:39:25.459
Caption: about a hundred or so possible things

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:28.070
Caption: that can go wrong orders of magnitude

00:39:25.459 --> 00:39:29.659
Caption: easier right so that&#39;s a big deal right

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:31.310
Caption: there so if something does go wrong I

00:39:29.659 --> 00:39:34.069
Caption: have a decent shot at figuring out what

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:35.780
Caption: that is also if I have to back it out

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:39.080
Caption: it&#39;s easier if I have to back it out

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:40.969
Caption: fewer people are affected so I don&#39;t

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:43.160
Caption: have such a big blast radius I don&#39;t

00:39:40.969 --> 00:39:44.750
Caption: have such a big disappointment so

00:39:43.159 --> 00:39:47.809
Caption: there&#39;s lots of advantages to doing it

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:50.899
Caption: smaller it turns out I may not actually

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:52.790
Caption: get more done in a year this way but I

00:39:50.899 --> 00:39:55.760
Caption: have a better likelihood of success I

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:58.610
Caption: have that flywheel effect and in fact it

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.959
Caption: turns out as jazz and and and Farley and

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:02.780
Caption: others talked about when they talk about

00:39:59.959 --> 00:40:04.909
Caption: continuous delivery as you build up this

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:07.699
Caption: ability to do these in small pieces and

00:40:04.909 --> 00:40:09.799
Caption: it gets easier and easier and easier and

00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:11.899
Caption: easier and easier and pretty soon your

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.729
Caption: pace it&#39;s not just two weeks you can be

00:40:11.899 --> 00:40:16.309
Caption: like Etsy you can actually do it

00:40:13.729 --> 00:40:18.250
Caption: multiple times a day if you like so that

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:21.920
Caption: flywheel principle makes a lot of sense

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:24.500
Caption: there&#39;s this tremendous power in this

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:25.599
Caption: ability to do just a little bit every

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.219
Caption: single day

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:32.630
Caption: Tom and Mary poppendieck who brought

00:40:28.219 --> 00:40:35.780
Caption: lean-to software have this idea and they

00:40:32.629 --> 00:40:37.549
Caption: say if you had to change one line of

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.320
Caption: code in your system

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:41.109
Caption: how long before it shows up in

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:46.719
Caption: production

00:40:41.108 --> 00:40:50.748
Caption: it&#39;s a day a week a month an hour

00:40:46.719 --> 00:40:52.209
Caption: that&#39;s your agility that&#39;s your speed

00:40:50.749 --> 00:40:55.219
Caption: that&#39;s your delivery speed right there

00:40:52.209 --> 00:40:58.189
Caption: and if you can just shave a little bit

00:40:55.219 --> 00:41:00.618
Caption: of time off of that that gets you closer

00:40:58.189 --> 00:41:04.068
Caption: and closer to doing great things and

00:41:00.618 --> 00:41:06.318
Caption: when the cost of change gets cheaper and

00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:08.509
Caption: when the risk gets lower you&#39;re more

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:10.759
Caption: likely to try something different you&#39;re

00:41:08.509 --> 00:41:12.769
Caption: more likely to try experiments that

00:41:10.759 --> 00:41:14.989
Caption: might get you from that good to great

00:41:12.769 --> 00:41:16.969
Caption: because it&#39;s not such a big risk anymore

00:41:14.989 --> 00:41:21.439
Caption: it&#39;s not betting the company every time

00:41:16.969 --> 00:41:23.328
Caption: you wanted to go into production so I&#39;ve

00:41:21.439 --> 00:41:25.399
Caption: talked about these principles and I&#39;ve

00:41:23.329 --> 00:41:27.710
Caption: talked about them sort of in these ways

00:41:25.399 --> 00:41:30.008
Caption: of API companies and tech companies I

00:41:27.709 --> 00:41:32.989
Caption: love that Spotify has this notion of

00:41:30.009 --> 00:41:35.509
Caption: level 5 developers of how developers can

00:41:32.989 --> 00:41:37.579
Caption: move up the ladder how Netflix focuses

00:41:35.509 --> 00:41:38.869
Caption: on first getting the right people on the

00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:41.569
Caption: bus before they worry about where

00:41:38.868 --> 00:41:44.598
Caption: they&#39;re going how yeah he was able to

00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:47.329
Caption: constantly confront the brutal facts and

00:41:44.599 --> 00:41:50.089
Caption: actually get praised for it inside his

00:41:47.329 --> 00:41:52.279
Caption: company and how Twilio has this notion

00:41:50.089 --> 00:41:55.130
Caption: of really tapping into our passions and

00:41:52.279 --> 00:41:57.079
Caption: how balance payments has this discipline

00:41:55.129 --> 00:41:59.268
Caption: this idea that we can do the little

00:41:57.079 --> 00:42:01.160
Caption: things and it makes a difference and how

00:41:59.269 --> 00:42:03.589
Caption: Amazon is willing to try whatever

00:42:01.159 --> 00:42:05.389
Caption: technology makes sense for it to get to

00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:08.150
Caption: its goals and what it wants to do and

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:10.879
Caption: finally that Etsy teaches us so much

00:42:08.149 --> 00:42:12.739
Caption: about how just incremental ISM little

00:42:10.879 --> 00:42:14.479
Caption: bits of things help you reach a

00:42:12.739 --> 00:42:17.179
Caption: greatness that you might not normally

00:42:14.479 --> 00:42:21.529
Caption: get and I think these are just really

00:42:17.179 --> 00:42:23.509
Caption: really powerful so I have a sort of a

00:42:21.529 --> 00:42:26.539
Caption: Steve Jobs II one more thing kind of

00:42:23.509 --> 00:42:28.609
Caption: deal for this remember this thing when

00:42:26.539 --> 00:42:31.459
Caption: we talked about this this idea of of

00:42:28.608 --> 00:42:32.959
Caption: capable and team members and managers

00:42:31.459 --> 00:42:35.858
Caption: contributing and stuff like that

00:42:32.959 --> 00:42:38.899
Caption: I thought about this and I said can I

00:42:35.858 --> 00:42:42.528
Caption: directly translate that into a kind of

00:42:38.899 --> 00:42:45.949
Caption: an API pyramid can I come up with level

00:42:42.529 --> 00:42:49.520
Caption: five api&#39;s what would those be about

00:42:45.949 --> 00:42:52.639
Caption: and my colleague Ronnie meter who works

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:56.630
Caption: in the API Academy has has done a lot of

00:42:52.639 --> 00:42:58.489
Caption: research on usability and human-computer

00:42:56.629 --> 00:43:00.048
Caption: interaction these other things and and

00:42:58.489 --> 00:43:01.429
Caption: he has a lot of this so I&#39;m gonna kind

00:43:00.049 --> 00:43:03.410
Caption: of steal from some of the things that

00:43:01.429 --> 00:43:06.348
Caption: he&#39;s taught me and kind of extend on it

00:43:03.409 --> 00:43:10.039
Caption: a little bit so at sort of the level one

00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:15.260
Caption: API you have a API that&#39;s functional it

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:18.069
Caption: works that&#39;s good it&#39;s ok a little a

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:20.209
Caption: little hard to use not so much fun I

00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:22.309
Caption: can&#39;t believe they did it this way I

00:43:20.209 --> 00:43:25.939
Caption: guess it works right we all have these

00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:28.549
Caption: experiences where yes it&#39;s ok I really

00:43:25.939 --> 00:43:29.959
Caption: prefer they did something else and you

00:43:28.549 --> 00:43:32.829
Caption: can go beyond that just plain

00:43:29.959 --> 00:43:34.848
Caption: functionality to something that is is

00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:36.680
Caption: reliable it&#39;s not only does it work but

00:43:34.849 --> 00:43:39.470
Caption: at least it&#39;s consistent and it works

00:43:36.679 --> 00:43:40.308
Caption: all the time and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty

00:43:39.469 --> 00:43:43.368
Caption: effective

00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:44.869
Caption: it&#39;s decent its it actually I feel

00:43:43.368 --> 00:43:46.760
Caption: pretty good about this I am I have some

00:43:44.868 --> 00:43:49.578
Caption: good confidence and if I feel a little

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:53.329
Caption: better about this even more importantly

00:43:49.579 --> 00:43:55.430
Caption: I have an API that&#39;s easy to use it

00:43:53.329 --> 00:43:57.260
Caption: isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t just functional it isn&#39;t

00:43:55.429 --> 00:43:59.209
Caption: just reliable but it&#39;s pretty easy to

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:03.260
Caption: use it&#39;s actually hard to screw up with

00:43:59.209 --> 00:44:05.209
Caption: this API right we all know products that

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:07.010
Caption: start that we just sort of say you know

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:08.568
Caption: what this product kind of understands me

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:11.179
Caption: this is exactly how I think this ought

00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:14.210
Caption: to work we also know apps where we just

00:44:11.179 --> 00:44:16.879
Caption: get really pissed like what do you mean

00:44:14.209 --> 00:44:19.040
Caption: I just deleted all my contacts that

00:44:16.879 --> 00:44:21.618
Caption: buttons too small you know we all have

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.419
Caption: these experiences and when we&#39;re working

00:44:21.618 --> 00:44:26.389
Caption: inside an organization we&#39;re designing

00:44:23.419 --> 00:44:28.818
Caption: api&#39;s for their our team members or for

00:44:26.389 --> 00:44:30.769
Caption: partners or customers they have the same

00:44:28.819 --> 00:44:32.809
Caption: experience with our API so like I can&#39;t

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:35.569
Caption: believe you made it so easy for me to

00:44:32.809 --> 00:44:38.829
Caption: delete the database and there&#39;s no

00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:42.440
Caption: backup there&#39;s no there&#39;s no undo and

00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:45.650
Caption: past usable is actually present like

00:44:42.439 --> 00:44:47.030
Caption: this is fun like I love doing this in

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:49.219
Caption: matter of fact I love it so much I&#39;m

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:51.829
Caption: gonna tell my friends at the next Meetup

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:53.389
Caption: about this API that I use and that

00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:56.270
Caption: starts to get really powerful for

00:44:53.389 --> 00:44:57.309
Caption: suddenly now this API actually makes me

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:59.469
Caption: feel good

00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:01.030
Caption: I like working with this that in fact I

00:44:59.469 --> 00:45:02.260
Caption: think I want to learn more about this

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:04.510
Caption: language or more about this technology

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:06.790
Caption: because this is really interesting to me

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:08.739
Caption: and I&#39;ll start to share this with lots

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:11.709
Caption: of other people now I may I might even

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:14.350
Caption: get passionate about it but so even

00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:16.119
Caption: beyond that is not only do I like doing

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:17.979
Caption: this but I&#39;ve done a lot of this and

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:21.280
Caption: there&#39;s nobody that does this better

00:45:17.979 --> 00:45:25.030
Caption: than that right so suddenly I&#39;m creating

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.510
Caption: an API that nobody can do as well as we

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.729
Caption: can

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:30.790
Caption: I&#39;m actually starting to turn this in

00:45:27.729 --> 00:45:36.669
Caption: what in the world happen there I guess I

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:38.290
Caption: got an update that&#39;s a bad API so I like

00:45:36.669 --> 00:45:40.649
Caption: this idea that there are there are

00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:43.719
Caption: levels to this for a handful of reasons

00:45:40.649 --> 00:45:45.429
Caption: we all start somewhere on this chart our

00:45:43.719 --> 00:45:48.129
Caption: organization is always somewhere on this

00:45:45.429 --> 00:45:49.659
Caption: chart and for most of us there&#39;s still a

00:45:48.129 --> 00:45:51.879
Caption: lot of headroom there&#39;s still a lot of

00:45:49.659 --> 00:45:53.889
Caption: opportunity and there&#39;s still a lot of

00:45:51.879 --> 00:45:56.409
Caption: ways we can think about it and the way

00:45:53.889 --> 00:45:58.089
Caption: Roni taught me this kind of thing about

00:45:56.409 --> 00:46:00.189
Caption: usability and functionality and

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:01.989
Caption: experience is you&#39;re always thinking

00:46:00.189 --> 00:46:04.689
Caption: about it from the users point of view

00:46:01.989 --> 00:46:07.090
Caption: from helping them solve their problem

00:46:04.689 --> 00:46:08.679
Caption: how do they feel about using it how do

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:11.140
Caption: they feel about using the work that I do

00:46:08.679 --> 00:46:13.359
Caption: and I love that that really kind of

00:46:11.139 --> 00:46:15.069
Caption: touches into that doing hard work and

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:17.110
Caption: being humble it&#39;s not about me but it&#39;s

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:18.729
Caption: about you so I think there&#39;s lots of

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:21.040
Caption: really cool things in this notion and

00:46:18.729 --> 00:46:22.659
Caption: ways to think about this I&#39;m gonna

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:25.689
Caption: mention I really love this book

00:46:22.659 --> 00:46:28.059
Caption: designing for a motion by Erin Walker

00:46:25.689 --> 00:46:29.560
Caption: Walter it&#39;s this idea about how do I get

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:31.150
Caption: beyond just something that&#39;s functional

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.320
Caption: but something that makes people feel II

00:46:31.149 --> 00:46:34.659
Caption: feel really good

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:37.300
Caption: a lot of human-computer action is about

00:46:34.659 --> 00:46:39.369
Caption: how we touch emotions how people feel

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:42.640
Caption: about what this is this is also becoming

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:45.010
Caption: a really big thing in the AI space or in

00:46:42.639 --> 00:46:47.289
Caption: the bot space we talk about all these

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:49.479
Caption: things where people might feel kind of

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:51.699
Caption: creeped out about how computers start to

00:46:49.479 --> 00:46:53.590
Caption: interact with us but sometimes we

00:46:51.699 --> 00:46:56.109
Caption: actually feel pretty good we feel pretty

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:58.510
Caption: pretty pretty okay about this and it

00:46:56.110 --> 00:47:00.040
Caption: actually it can be pleasurable so how

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:03.130
Caption: can we design for that how can we design

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:04.540
Caption: past just functional and usable into

00:47:03.129 --> 00:47:06.789
Caption: that space where people really get

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:08.530
Caption: passionate and excited and this last

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:10.250
Caption: quote from Collins I&#39;m gonna add because

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:12.949
Caption: I really like this quote

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:15.679
Caption: basically you can accomplish anything if

00:47:12.949 --> 00:47:18.949
Caption: you don&#39;t care who gets credit and it

00:47:15.679 --> 00:47:21.260
Caption: goes right back to Collins first thing

00:47:18.949 --> 00:47:24.800
Caption: about how you want to work hard and be

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:28.100
Caption: humble and the challenge for me when I

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:30.679
Caption: when I travel is often the people I

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:32.000
Caption: would love to talk to more and more are

00:47:30.679 --> 00:47:34.040
Caption: the people who have this kind of

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.560
Caption: attitude and often they&#39;re the ones

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.570
Caption: standing off to the corner there in the

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:40.640
Caption: back of the room they&#39;re not the ones up

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:42.860
Caption: in front of the room speaking they&#39;re

00:47:40.639 --> 00:47:46.579
Caption: the humble ones so you have to look for

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:48.500
Caption: them and you probably have them in your

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:50.840
Caption: company you probably know who they are

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:53.209
Caption: who are the ones that work hard and are

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:55.670
Caption: humble and they probably have a lot to

00:47:53.209 --> 00:47:57.949
Caption: teach all of us about how to turn

00:47:55.669 --> 00:47:59.869
Caption: something from good to great and I hope

00:47:57.949 --> 00:48:01.609
Caption: you can find those people inside your

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:03.920
Caption: organization and that you can start

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:05.840
Caption: doing that same thing so that&#39;s what I

00:48:03.919 --> 00:48:08.619
Caption: have I want to thank you very much for

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.620
Caption: listening thanks

00:48:12.099 --> 00:48:18.380
Caption: turn over to you do we have some time

00:48:14.419 --> 00:48:21.588
Caption: for questions okay I&#39;d be happy to

00:48:18.379 --> 00:48:24.348
Caption: answer any questions about this or

00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:26.210
Caption: possibly other things I don&#39;t want to

00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:28.130
Caption: open it up and be responsible for

00:48:26.209 --> 00:48:30.469
Caption: anything but is there any questions at

00:48:28.129 --> 00:48:32.269
Caption: all I&#39;d be happy to share comments maybe

00:48:30.469 --> 00:48:34.098
Caption: you have examples explaining your own

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:35.919
Caption: experience about some of these these

00:48:34.099 --> 00:48:58.700
Caption: things we talked about as well

00:48:35.919 --> 00:49:00.949
Caption: anything anyone yes yeah so the question

00:48:58.699 --> 00:49:03.618
Caption: was I talked about Amazon and how Amazon

00:49:00.949 --> 00:49:05.209
Caption: kinda doesn&#39;t care too much about the

00:49:03.618 --> 00:49:07.459
Caption: technology that you and your team ends

00:49:05.209 --> 00:49:09.739
Caption: up using is that manageable how do they

00:49:07.459 --> 00:49:13.189
Caption: deal with the variance and how do they

00:49:09.739 --> 00:49:16.639
Caption: deal with with that the way they explain

00:49:13.189 --> 00:49:18.319
Caption: it to us is they offer a sort of a set

00:49:16.639 --> 00:49:21.799
Caption: of tools like a common way of doing

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:23.930
Caption: things and they allow the teams to make

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.520
Caption: their own decisions if they want to go

00:49:23.929 --> 00:49:27.709
Caption: off-book if they want to do something

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.659
Caption: else there are some basic rules about

00:49:27.709 --> 00:49:31.459
Caption: staying within the guardrails there&#39;s

00:49:29.659 --> 00:49:34.368
Caption: some security checks or some other

00:49:31.459 --> 00:49:37.189
Caption: things licensing issues but for the most

00:49:34.368 --> 00:49:39.649
Caption: part they don&#39;t focus a lot about the

00:49:37.189 --> 00:49:41.719
Caption: inside of a team as a matter of fact the

00:49:39.649 --> 00:49:43.789
Caption: things we hear about Amazon is Amazon

00:49:41.719 --> 00:49:46.639
Caption: teams are fairly black boxy you can&#39;t

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:47.900
Caption: really see too much inside a team they

00:49:46.639 --> 00:49:49.819
Caption: might use a different language than

00:49:47.899 --> 00:49:53.239
Caption: another team and so on and so forth so

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:55.430
Caption: they really govern that that that shared

00:49:53.239 --> 00:49:58.368
Caption: understanding between parties or then

00:49:55.429 --> 00:50:02.149
Caption: they do what happens inside the box the

00:49:58.368 --> 00:50:05.989
Caption: line that Vernor Vogel&#39;s shares about

00:50:02.149 --> 00:50:08.750
Caption: this whole idea is you built it you own

00:50:05.989 --> 00:50:10.219
Caption: it so it&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t want to use

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:12.020
Caption: this stuff we suggest if you want to use

00:50:10.219 --> 00:50:14.358
Caption: something else just know that you&#39;re the

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:16.550
Caption: one that&#39;s responsible so that&#39;s sort of

00:50:14.358 --> 00:50:18.799
Caption: the way it the culture kind of works

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:21.739
Caption: there the impression that we get is that

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:24.140
Caption: it&#39;s pretty much a you know a very

00:50:21.739 --> 00:50:25.550
Caption: competitive culture you&#39;re free to be as

00:50:24.139 --> 00:50:27.199
Caption: creative as you want

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:29.030
Caption: you just have to make sure you produce

00:50:27.199 --> 00:50:30.949
Caption: as expected and so that&#39;s pretty much

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:33.020
Caption: the pattern we&#39;re also told when we talk

00:50:30.949 --> 00:50:34.909
Caption: to people there that there is lots of

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:36.739
Caption: actual duplication of things people will

00:50:34.909 --> 00:50:38.689
Caption: fork things and have their own copy and

00:50:36.739 --> 00:50:39.979
Caption: as long as they maintain their own copy

00:50:38.689 --> 00:50:42.560
Caption: they don&#39;t care that there&#39;s lots of

00:50:39.979 --> 00:50:44.929
Caption: duplication so that&#39;s just kind of the

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.370
Caption: culture that amazon has I would find

00:50:44.929 --> 00:50:48.290
Caption: that pretty challenging to work in

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:50.060
Caption: myself I think I guess maybe at a team

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:52.340
Caption: level I&#39;d like it but if I was

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:54.380
Caption: responsible for for understanding larger

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:56.390
Caption: bits of it it&#39;d be kind of tough but I

00:50:54.379 --> 00:50:58.039
Caption: think that just seems to be working well

00:50:56.389 --> 00:51:16.309
Caption: for Amazon right now it&#39;s a good

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:18.290
Caption: question yes yeah if I understand it

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:19.850
Caption: it&#39;s like a lot of the things I talked

00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:22.160
Caption: about we&#39;re very product oriented or

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:24.530
Caption: sort of solution oriented right and

00:51:22.159 --> 00:51:27.260
Caption: which you&#39;re asking about is sort of

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:29.719
Caption: this idea of a problem domain space or

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:31.489
Caption: something that might not be the end

00:51:29.719 --> 00:51:33.530
Caption: solution there&#39;s some other kind of

00:51:31.489 --> 00:51:35.360
Caption: solution like CQRS solves a different

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:40.360
Caption: kind of problem is is that kind of the

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:44.660
Caption: way you&#39;re thinking about that sir yeah

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:46.010
Caption: yeah yeah so we can talk a little bit

00:51:44.659 --> 00:51:48.349
Caption: about that sort of understanding the

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:50.899
Caption: problem before you start the solution a

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:54.320
Caption: lot of organizations that I that I end

00:51:50.899 --> 00:51:55.819
Caption: up talking to most of the many of the

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.330
Caption: the parts of the system that they&#39;re

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.969
Caption: building

00:51:56.330 --> 00:52:01.219
Caption: they don&#39;t actually understand the

00:51:58.969 --> 00:52:02.840
Caption: problem that the final solution is

00:52:01.219 --> 00:52:05.149
Caption: solving in other words they&#39;re actually

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:07.400
Caption: building infrastructure or framework for

00:52:05.149 --> 00:52:09.349
Caption: other people to create solutions to

00:52:07.399 --> 00:52:11.029
Caption: solve problems that&#39;s for example that&#39;s

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:13.520
Caption: really Amazon&#39;s motive right

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:16.699
Caption: at the same time each one of them has

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:18.890
Caption: their own responsibility for a domain

00:52:16.699 --> 00:52:21.520
Caption: right so if our domain is data if our

00:52:18.889 --> 00:52:24.260
Caption: domain is messaging if our domain is is

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:26.060
Caption: managing users or something we have our

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:28.610
Caption: own ubiquitous language we have our own

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:30.080
Caption: domain understanding that we have to be

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:33.260
Caption: consistent in so it&#39;s the sort of

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:34.550
Caption: coherence cohesion challenge right and a

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:37.340
Caption: thing like CQRS

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:39.260
Caption: turns out to be a technology that I can

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:41.690
Caption: use inside

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:43.790
Caption: solving that domain right so just

00:52:41.689 --> 00:52:45.679
Caption: because I want to separate commands

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:48.770
Caption: inquiries and stuff like that is really

00:52:45.679 --> 00:52:50.869
Caption: just a technological element to solving

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:53.510
Caption: the problem now if it turns out my job

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:55.460
Caption: is actually creating CQRS systems for

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:58.909
Caption: other to use that would become my

00:52:55.459 --> 00:53:00.050
Caption: problem domain so I find it kind of

00:52:58.909 --> 00:53:02.479
Caption: interesting that several of these

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:05.209
Caption: organizations have this notion of

00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:07.729
Caption: creating building block systems in order

00:53:05.209 --> 00:53:09.919
Caption: for somebody else to create solutions

00:53:07.729 --> 00:53:11.989
Caption: for that means they&#39;re in a world where

00:53:09.919 --> 00:53:14.270
Caption: they don&#39;t know the problem that they&#39;re

00:53:11.989 --> 00:53:16.669
Caption: being used to solve now Netflix is not

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:18.500
Caption: like that Netflix has a shared

00:53:16.669 --> 00:53:20.629
Caption: understanding from top to bottom they

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:22.340
Caption: have some people in the you know and the

00:53:20.629 --> 00:53:24.259
Caption: baseline of the organization that do

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:26.960
Caption: things like we do operations we do

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:28.760
Caption: release we do data management but their

00:53:26.959 --> 00:53:31.280
Caption: language of their business is pretty

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:35.479
Caption: simple at C&#39;s the same way Twilio is the

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:37.699
Caption: same way so making sure you you you sort

00:53:35.479 --> 00:53:40.669
Caption: of have this idea of what our domain is

00:53:37.699 --> 00:53:42.739
Caption: and and whether or not there&#39;s that

00:53:40.669 --> 00:53:44.479
Caption: domain is just the all-encompassing one

00:53:42.739 --> 00:53:47.659
Caption: or at some subset part is definitely

00:53:44.479 --> 00:53:50.540
Caption: definitely can be a challenge what I

00:53:47.659 --> 00:53:52.129
Caption: find really interesting is one of the

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:54.500
Caption: things that we&#39;re starting to see as

00:53:52.129 --> 00:53:56.809
Caption: people are spending more time in this

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:59.419
Caption: smaller service space in this mornin

00:53:56.810 --> 00:54:01.100
Caption: sort of context boundary space we

00:53:59.419 --> 00:54:03.530
Caption: learned from a couple organizations is

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:06.590
Caption: it turns out that the boundaries change

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:09.500
Caption: over time it turns out that what made

00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:10.880
Caption: sense to release in this clump probably

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:12.770
Caption: needs to be released in two clumps

00:54:10.879 --> 00:54:15.349
Caption: because now we have to scale something

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:18.199
Caption: more than we did last time so it isn&#39;t

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:20.840
Caption: so much a one of the things that unless

00:54:18.199 --> 00:54:23.060
Caption: Martin Fowler has pointed out and some

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:26.630
Caption: other people have pointed out is the

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:28.699
Caption: best way to do a great just context

00:54:26.629 --> 00:54:30.589
Caption: boundary or great domain design is to

00:54:28.699 --> 00:54:32.209
Caption: already know this there&#39;s no the design

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:35.479
Caption: and no the system before you actually

00:54:32.209 --> 00:54:39.469
Caption: build this and that&#39;s really an example

00:54:35.479 --> 00:54:42.530
Caption: of system 1 and system 2 from James from

00:54:39.469 --> 00:54:44.419
Caption: Brooks this idea that the first system

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:46.340
Caption: you build you learn an awful lot it&#39;s

00:54:44.419 --> 00:54:47.449
Caption: not always the best one so you build a

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.580
Caption: second one that&#39;s better

00:54:47.449 --> 00:54:52.320
Caption: all right and we all experience this we

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:55.260
Caption: all experience rebuilds redesigns

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:57.600
Caption: so there&#39;s certainly that part of it but

00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:59.580
Caption: I think what happens is there&#39;s also

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.350
Caption: system three and system four and system

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:03.330
Caption: five we learn from each release and I

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:05.160
Caption: think one of the things that that makes

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:06.870
Caption: sense is that&#39;s why incrementalism is so

00:55:05.159 --> 00:55:08.489
Caption: powerful because I get to release

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:10.650
Caption: another one tomorrow I get to fix it a

00:55:08.489 --> 00:55:12.350
Caption: little bit tomorrow hopefully that comes

00:55:10.649 --> 00:55:36.389
Caption: close to what we&#39;re talking about yeah

00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:38.520
Caption: others yes yes if I understand the

00:55:36.389 --> 00:55:40.679
Caption: question the answer is yes so actually

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:43.350
Caption: Netflix does that right

00:55:40.679 --> 00:55:48.239
Caption: Netflix designs their system based on

00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:50.610
Caption: this idea of type 1 and type 2 safety do

00:55:48.239 --> 00:55:54.179
Caption: we know this Eric hole Nagel who&#39;s kind

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:57.840
Caption: of a hero of the DevOps movement talks a

00:55:54.179 --> 00:55:59.159
Caption: lot about route control or causes of

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.660
Caption: errors and that kind of thing

00:55:59.159 --> 00:56:02.609
Caption: he actually works not just in the IT

00:56:00.659 --> 00:56:05.189
Caption: space but with hospitals and nuclear

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:07.920
Caption: power plants how do you how do you make

00:56:05.189 --> 00:56:10.500
Caption: them safe and there are two key forms of

00:56:07.919 --> 00:56:12.419
Caption: doing this type one safety is I find all

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:14.489
Caption: the bugs and I remove them I spend the

00:56:12.419 --> 00:56:17.129
Caption: effort to remove them and the type 2

00:56:14.489 --> 00:56:20.310
Caption: safety is I remove as many as I can but

00:56:17.129 --> 00:56:23.279
Caption: I add more into the system to survive

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:25.969
Caption: any bugs that I haven&#39;t found right so I

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:28.290
Caption: type 2 safety is I&#39;m gonna survive

00:56:25.969 --> 00:56:32.340
Caption: there&#39;s a line there&#39;s a book called

00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:33.989
Caption: system antics system antics and I forget

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:37.020
Caption: the name of the author but one of the

00:56:33.989 --> 00:56:39.959
Caption: quotes from that book is great systems

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:43.110
Caption: reliable systems continue to operate

00:56:39.959 --> 00:56:45.239
Caption: even in failure mode so even when things

00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:46.739
Caption: are failing they keep working and we

00:56:45.239 --> 00:56:49.590
Caption: know lots of examples of this in real

00:56:46.739 --> 00:56:52.619
Caption: life like airplanes right and nuclear

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:54.479
Caption: power plants and and a lot of times cars

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:56.070
Caption: and all sorts of other things they

00:56:54.479 --> 00:56:57.330
Caption: continue to work even when parts of the

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:59.400
Caption: system go down go through it&#39;s

00:56:57.330 --> 00:57:01.290
Caption: redundancy or some other thing like that

00:56:59.399 --> 00:57:02.789
Caption: so there are lots of pretty good

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:05.539
Caption: examples of that and we definitely have

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:08.029
Caption: companies that focus on this idea

00:57:05.539 --> 00:57:09.619
Caption: there&#39;s a great book by Michael Nygaard

00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:15.289
Caption: Michael Nygaard is also going to be a

00:57:09.618 --> 00:57:18.439
Caption: guest right for y&#39;all Perth and he has a

00:57:15.289 --> 00:57:20.089
Caption: book called release it name buddy seen

00:57:18.439 --> 00:57:23.019
Caption: this book release it it&#39;s a great book

00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:25.759
Caption: and he has this section in it about

00:57:23.019 --> 00:57:28.219
Caption: basically releasable software needs to

00:57:25.759 --> 00:57:29.419
Caption: be resilient software and he has a whole

00:57:28.219 --> 00:57:32.779
Caption: section on what are called stability

00:57:29.419 --> 00:57:34.848
Caption: patterns and capability yeah capability

00:57:32.779 --> 00:57:39.289
Caption: patterns so stability patterns are

00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:42.400
Caption: things like circuit breaker bulkhead

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:44.989
Caption: handshaking fail fast timeout

00:57:42.399 --> 00:57:47.808
Caption: steady-state all these sort of patterns

00:57:44.989 --> 00:57:49.819
Caption: to help you continue to work continue to

00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:52.819
Caption: survive protect yourself from other

00:57:49.819 --> 00:57:54.440
Caption: things as well as survive bugs from

00:57:52.819 --> 00:57:57.680
Caption: other places or even bugs in your own

00:57:54.439 --> 00:58:00.289
Caption: system well in the comments that Michael

00:57:57.679 --> 00:58:04.068
Caption: makes in that book is that it turns out

00:58:00.289 --> 00:58:06.249
Caption: you often spend more time coding for

00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:08.930
Caption: resiliency than coding for functionality

00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:10.429
Caption: right so here&#39;s a whole book that&#39;s

00:58:08.929 --> 00:58:12.499
Caption: talks about how to do this he&#39;s actually

00:58:10.429 --> 00:58:13.788
Caption: in that second edition right now so I

00:58:12.499 --> 00:58:15.380
Caption: think especially those of us who are

00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:18.140
Caption: starting to work in micro service space

00:58:15.379 --> 00:58:19.758
Caption: where there there&#39;s more network there&#39;s

00:58:18.139 --> 00:58:21.919
Caption: possibly more network time than there is

00:58:19.759 --> 00:58:24.169
Caption: compute time in what we&#39;re doing then

00:58:21.919 --> 00:58:25.578
Caption: we&#39;re also good doing this idea of

00:58:24.169 --> 00:58:27.979
Caption: designing for failure

00:58:25.579 --> 00:58:29.630
Caption: what&#39;s the not seem to lead book there&#39;s

00:58:27.979 --> 00:58:33.529
Caption: a there&#39;s a book that&#39;s sort of based on

00:58:29.629 --> 00:58:36.229
Caption: this what is it anti fragile right and

00:58:33.529 --> 00:58:38.809
Caption: seem has an even sort of next-level way

00:58:36.229 --> 00:58:42.889
Caption: of thinking about this and that is that

00:58:38.809 --> 00:58:45.459
Caption: that ability to survive in in a bit of

00:58:42.889 --> 00:58:48.229
Caption: chaos actually makes you stronger

00:58:45.459 --> 00:58:51.739
Caption: actually makes you better you get to

00:58:48.229 --> 00:58:53.539
Caption: learn from that so I I don&#39;t quite like

00:58:51.739 --> 00:58:55.849
Caption: I don&#39;t know quite how to translate that

00:58:53.539 --> 00:58:58.009
Caption: into IT but I know I&#39;m pretty sure the

00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:59.450
Caption: anti fragile book is the one that they

00:58:58.009 --> 00:59:01.699
Caption: is one of them books they hand out at

00:58:59.449 --> 00:59:03.709
Caption: Netflix to their new engineers so this

00:59:01.699 --> 00:59:05.899
Caption: is definitely you&#39;re hitting on it like

00:59:03.709 --> 00:59:08.868
Caption: a really important space it could be as

00:59:05.899 --> 00:59:11.989
Caption: we start to get more AI to start

00:59:08.868 --> 00:59:13.669
Caption: adjusting how things work together that

00:59:11.989 --> 00:59:16.219
Caption: that&#39;s where that learning is that the

00:59:13.669 --> 00:59:18.089
Caption: that that difficulty that friction that

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:20.429
Caption: trouble that

00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:21.570
Caption: set of bugs actually strengthen systems

00:59:20.429 --> 00:59:23.729
Caption: they learn how to kind of repair

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:25.199
Caption: themselves so that&#39;s that&#39;s another

00:59:23.729 --> 00:59:29.629
Caption: possibility it&#39;s a good question

00:59:25.199 --> 00:59:35.099
Caption: very good anything else we doing okay

00:59:29.629 --> 00:59:36.689
Caption: yes all right well I just want to say

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:38.220
Caption: thank you very very much

00:59:36.689 --> 00:59:43.099
Caption: I&#39;ve had a great time and I&#39;m gonna turn

00:59:38.219 --> 00:59:43.099
Caption: it back over to Amy thank you thanks

00:59:43.469 --> 00:59:48.899
Caption: [Applause]

00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:58.670
Caption: that&#39;s right exactly

01:00:03.949 --> 01:00:22.679
Caption: really actually I will be here through

01:00:20.699 --> 01:00:25.800
Caption: Saturday so we&#39;ll have the workshop

01:00:22.679 --> 01:00:28.260
Caption: tomorrow and then I get Friday off so I

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:32.580
Caption: think I&#39;m gonna go to rottenness I think

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:34.080
Caption: get on the ferry pet something is that

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:35.580
Caption: what I&#39;m supposed to do huh

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:43.370
Caption: Yeah right I&#39;m supposed to do that right

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:43.370
Caption: and maybe yeah I get everything right

01:00:49.129 --> 01:00:56.219
Caption: all right I&#39;ll do that insure it yep oh

01:00:53.899 --> 01:00:57.539
Caption: yes I thought I would never do that

01:00:56.219 --> 01:01:00.139
Caption: absolutely

01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:00.140
Caption: Wow

01:01:05.889 --> 01:02:16.519
Caption: one of my friends will have a good time

01:01:33.260 --> 01:02:17.830
Caption: tomorrow midnight excellent thanks

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:22.689
Caption: thanks

01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:22.690
