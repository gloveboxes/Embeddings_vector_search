  "description": "Have you ever started your morning by worrying about \u201Cthat person\u201D, and how long you can put off having to deal with them? Do thoughts of this person and their actions occupy your mind when you should be focussing on work or your personal life? Have you been so unmotivated and anxious about work that you\u2019ve considered quitting?\\n\\nToxic developers can make you doubt yourself and your abilities.  Their behaviour can be hugely disruptive to the success of individuals and ultimately teams as a whole.\\n\\nI will address how to identify and deal with toxic developers in the workplace by providing you with strategies you can apply day to day. My aim is to help you regain your focus by sharing coping mechanisms and healthy ways to respond to a situation, whether it is you who is affected or your teammates.\\n\\nThere may be others on your team who struggle and self-sacrifice in an attempt to cope with the situation. No one should leave a job they enjoy or lose their passion for their work because of one individual."
