  "description": "High performing teams require the ability to deploy code to production on demand, multiple times a day. Continuous delivery techniques such as trunk-based development have demanded the use of patterns that reduce batch size and deployment risk.\\n\\nFeature Toggles have emerged as a powerful pattern for enabling developers to deploy to production on-demand with confidence. Most developers will use the Feature Toggle pattern in some form through their journey - sometimes without being aware of it.\\n\\nIn this talk, I propose the question; what exactly is a Feature Toggle? What happens if we apply the definition to all code? Could the definition of a feature toggle be broader than most expect?\\n\\n--\\nI am a Software Developer with over 7 years of experience building highly-scalable distributed systems. I\u0027m passionate for modern design patterns and architectures such as Domain Driven Design, Event Sourcing and CQRS. I am an advocate for creating cultures of ownership, accountability, transparency and trust. I\u0027m a strong believer in the value of Continuous Delivery, and deploying software frequently with a high degree of automation."
