  "description": "Creativity is essential to innovation and problem solving, but our focus on data is narrowing our view of the people using our apps. For both our teams and our audience, this results in less engaging experiences and low retention. So what are you doing wrong? \\n\\nOur audience\u0027s attitudes towards apps have changed and so we must now move beyond \u0027users\u0027 to also considering the environment, and the world, that they exist within. Now, more than ever, people want inclusive, positive experiences. This, of course, can have big impacts on your budget and your project management, so how do you do it? How can you, as a designer, focus on the \u0027human\u0027 experience and not the \u0027user\u0027 experience? \\n\\nNo experience necessary\\n20 mins\\nDesign \\u0026 UX\\nDr. Karen Lowry is a UX Design lecturer at SAE Institute in Perth, Western Australia.
