00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.160
Caption: trying to understand what it means and I

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:25.019

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.979
Caption: they want to be a consultant now you

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.779
Caption: know without that exercise I wouldn&#39;t

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.479
Caption: break free from the traditional thinking

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:41.639
Caption: right we wouldn&#39;t think for myself what

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:44.519
Caption: we can learn or this deal from Jason&#39;s

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:46.440
Caption: Story here is that you as a leader of

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:49.319
Caption: today you have to challenge the initial

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.819
Caption: belief of your Junior so you help them

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:54.059
Caption: disrupt their traditional way of

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:56.519
Caption: thinking that might not be true and then

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:58.739
Caption: they can think for themselves or develop

00:06:56.519 --> 00:07:02.160
Caption: critical thinking skills now my next

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:04.739

Caption: of course I know her name but anyways it

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:12.720
Caption: was hard to get a job in Tech at first

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.300
Caption: like in in Tech in Australia especially

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.940
Caption: being an international student so kg

00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:21.059

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.459
Caption: she was so well connected she loved um

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:26.399
Caption: connecting people together she pushed so

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:28.799
Caption: hard to actually lend me the first job

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:31.019
Caption: at the Cisco partner company

00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:33.598

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:36.000
Caption: Tech right and that opportunity was so

00:07:33.598 --> 00:07:39.359
Caption: important to me to learn that hey

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.299
Caption: employment was a two-way street

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:45.000
Caption: as much as I want to be employed I also

00:07:42.299 --> 00:07:47.459
Caption: have to evaluate my employer value as

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.419
Caption: well so I later left that partner

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:54.660
Caption: company because I value did it online

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:57.179
Caption: but what we can learn from kg here is

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.459
Caption: leverage your extensive network to help

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.679

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.359
Caption: delivered my first workshop and I got

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.339

00:18:38.339 --> 00:18:44.159
Caption: Microsoft how dare you send the junior

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:47.038
Caption: person to teach us she wasted our time

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.020
Caption: and I was like wow that deflated me

00:18:47.038 --> 00:18:51.659
Caption: because I actually spent a lot of effort

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.339
Caption: on that but Sergio came in and I was

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.380
Caption: like hey I have extensive experience in

00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:57.000

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.679
Caption: to stand up in front of people and talk

00:19:06.418 --> 00:19:09.359
Caption: um and that would not be possible

00:19:07.678 --> 00:19:11.399
Caption: without Sergio

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:14.219

Caption: just one person you might say there&#39;s so

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.479
Caption: many Giants that&#39;s the point because you

00:19:38.038 --> 00:19:41.759
Caption: have so many people that you can

00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:42.719
