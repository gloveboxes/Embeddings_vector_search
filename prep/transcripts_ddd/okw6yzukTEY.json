  "description": "Have you ever told yourself or others that you can\u2019t draw? If you\u2019ve ever played a game of Pictionary then you\u2019ll know that getting your point across isn\u2019t necessarily about how beautiful your drawing is. Sketching isn\u2019t just for artists and designers - it\u2019s a powerful tool for communicating ideas, and you don\u2019t have to be Da Vinci to do it.\\n\\nMaybe you\u2019ve struggled to get a concept across in a meeting, but hesitated to grab a marker and start scribbling on the whiteboard. Maybe you\u2019ve struggled getting ideas out of your own head and onto paper, and dot points aren\u2019t cutting it. Maybe you\u2019re just not very good at Pictionary and want to beat your cousins at the next family party.\\n\\nYou\u2019ll learn why sketching is such an effective method of communication, and how to put together your own visual vocabulary to bust out next time when words alone are not enough. More importantly, we\u2019ll go over why anyone can develop the skills and confidence to use sketching in their work. No fancy tools or artistic talent required."
