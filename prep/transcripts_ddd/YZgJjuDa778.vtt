00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:05.819
Caption: a leader is not determined by someone&#39;s

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.059

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:11.760

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:39.839

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.920

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.360

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.220
Caption: going

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:37.019
Caption: so this talk is all about leadership

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.540
Caption: through self-awareness and that concept

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.419
Caption: is not a unique one

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.619
Caption: and I got the idea for this talk through

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.779
Caption: all the different leadership training

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:48.000
Caption: courses I&#39;ve done and I also did a lot

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:49.679
Caption: of research on the topic there&#39;s tons of

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.958
Caption: studies that have been published about

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:54.119
Caption: this but really the idea for the talk

00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:56.878
Caption: came through a leadership camp that I

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:59.098
Caption: attended through Rotary Club and then I

00:02:56.878 --> 00:03:01.378
Caption: went on to be a camp counselor for

00:02:59.098 --> 00:03:03.839
Caption: this Camp was called rila which stands

00:03:01.378 --> 00:03:05.220
Caption: for rotary youth leadership awards and

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:07.378
Caption: the whole Camp was centered around

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.059
Caption: building up your self-awareness and how

00:03:07.378 --> 00:03:10.080
Caption: that can help you to become a better

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:13.440
Caption: leader

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.378
Caption: so I was in this campus also focused on

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.300
Caption: young adults age 18 to 28 so I was lucky

00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:20.639
Caption: enough to be able to attend a few years

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.260
Caption: ago and then go on to council and help

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.658
Caption: share those skills with other people as

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:27.119
Caption: well and I&#39;m not trying to retrofit the

00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:29.580
Caption: camp into this talk but that idea of

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:31.378
Caption: becoming a great leader by understanding

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.119
Caption: yourself is one that has always stuck

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:35.819
Caption: with me so I decided to put together

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:38.458
Caption: this talk for all of you

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.958
Caption: so what is leadership leadership has

00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:42.479
Caption: many definitions

00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:45.298
Caption: I looked up the definition and it says

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:47.458
Caption: it&#39;s the action of leading a group of

00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:49.798
Caption: people or an organization

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:51.419
Caption: I didn&#39;t find that entirely helpful so I

00:03:49.798 --> 00:03:53.279
Caption: went on to then look up the definition

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.220
Caption: of Fleet

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:58.378
Caption: and this said it&#39;s the initiative and

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.259
Caption: inaction an example for others to follow

00:03:58.378 --> 00:04:03.839
Caption: up so if we put that together we can say

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:06.539
Caption: that leadership is the action of taking

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:09.360
Caption: the initiative and setting an example

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:12.360
Caption: for other people to then follow

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.298
Caption: and I like this definition because to me

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.359
Caption: a leader is somebody who has followers

00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:20.760
Caption: the followers are what make you a leader

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.680
Caption: it&#39;s not someone who necessarily has it

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.360
Caption: in their title or is that at the top of

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:26.759
Caption: the ladder in a corporate organization

00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:28.559
Caption: is the person who is out there making a

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.479
Caption: difference who is checking on those

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:33.059
Caption: teammates who might be struggling a

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.100
Caption: little bit having support being a role

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:37.320
Caption: model and setting an example really

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.399
Caption: being a true influence for others around

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.800
Caption: them

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:42.779
Caption: it can be anyone at any level that they

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:46.019
Caption: can have any sort of type of background

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:47.579
Caption: personality be any type of person they

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:50.819
Caption: could be you

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:53.339
Caption: a leader is someone who is out at the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.279
Caption: front being the center for everyone else

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:57.779
Caption: to see how they can really truly be a

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.639
Caption: great leader in helping other people

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:00.660
Caption: around them be the best versions of

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.699
Caption: themselves

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.100
Caption: and with the right skills and attitude

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:08.220
Caption: and approach to working with others

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.139
Caption: people will naturally follow you so what

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.540
Caption: makes a good leader I&#39;d like to hear

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.399
Caption: from some people in the audience what do

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.320
Caption: you think makes the good leader

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:19.619
Caption: just shout it out if

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.540

Caption: trust yes

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:31.019
Caption: respect definitely

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:33.419
Caption: listening yes

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:35.160
Caption: understanding yeah

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.199
Caption: yeah all of these traits are definitely

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.259
Caption: things that we we really want to see in

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.600
Caption: leaders we want to be able to have them

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.820
Caption: empathize with us listen to our concerns

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.500
Caption: to really support us as we&#39;re doing

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.440
Caption: things and understand when we&#39;re going

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.019
Caption: through maybe difficult situations

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.119
Caption: so they&#39;re the people who are you know

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:56.279
Caption: supporting us through those processes

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:57.899
Caption: um helping us when there might be maybe

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:59.639
Caption: those little tasks on the side that may

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.559
Caption: have been forgotten to help the team

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:03.600
Caption: reach the goal

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:05.639
Caption: and it doesn&#39;t always have to be just

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.919
Caption: one leader a lot of situations there&#39;s

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.559
Caption: leaders in different aspects that all

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.380
Caption: work together to help the team achieve

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:16.320
Caption: the end goal think about in a game of

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.899
Caption: basketball you have the coach you might

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.699
Caption: have the the team captain or you have

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:22.319
Caption: someone who&#39;s setting up the play who&#39;s

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.300
Caption: making the assist and then the person

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:27.059
Caption: who&#39;s shooting the hoop in the end

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:29.099
Caption: all of them had their own part to play

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:31.079
Caption: in reaching that outcome and they were

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.880
Caption: all leaders in their own right they took

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:36.978
Caption: that initiative and they supported one

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.979
Caption: another to help achieve success

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:42.479
Caption: so in the words of Bill Gates as we look

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:45.119
Caption: ahead into the next Century leaders will

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:47.220
Caption: be those who Empower others

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:49.559
Caption: so how do we Empower others

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:52.019
Caption: how do we become that person that other

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:54.299
Caption: people want to follow

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:57.539
Caption: and it really can come down to

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:59.220
Caption: understanding of ourselves before we can

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:01.319
Caption: look at taking care of those around us

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.119
Caption: and really influencing them we first

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:04.739
Caption: have to understand ourselves and our own

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:06.299
Caption: actions and how we approach different

00:07:04.739 --> 00:07:09.239
Caption: situations

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:11.459
Caption: self-awareness does not equate to

00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:13.859
Caption: leadership but it is a fundamental skill

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:15.000
Caption: that can really help you to be a great

00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:16.758
Caption: leader

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.559
Caption: and all those traits that we mentioned

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:22.139
Caption: empathy listening active communication

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:25.199
Caption: being authentic and supporting those

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:27.300
Caption: around you really empowering others

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:29.098
Caption: it first starts with understanding

00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:33.059
Caption: yourself

00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:35.279
Caption: so self-awareness well this is the act

00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:37.380
Caption: of being aware of yourself

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:40.739
Caption: it&#39;s all about being aware of your

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:43.020
Caption: emotions your personality how you react

00:07:40.739 --> 00:07:44.759
Caption: in different situations and how all

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:47.039
Caption: those things are perceived by others

Caption: your strengths and weaknesses the skills

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:50.880
Caption: that you have that you need to continue

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:52.019
Caption: to to work on or the ones that you&#39;re

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.360
Caption: really great at and you can really

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:57.660
Caption: harness and use

00:07:54.359 --> 00:08:00.299
Caption: people are not born completely

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.580
Caption: self-aware but as an infant as a baby we

00:08:00.299 --> 00:08:04.379
Caption: do start to develop self-awareness and

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:05.279
Caption: we can continue to build it throughout

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.739
Caption: our life

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:10.259
Caption: however research has shown that only 10

00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:12.959
Caption: to 15 percent of people are what they

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:14.459
Caption: consider truly self-aware

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:17.098
Caption: but we can all work on our

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:20.039
Caption: self-awareness and continue to build it

00:08:17.098 --> 00:08:24.059
Caption: the study of self-awareness that we know

00:08:20.039 --> 00:08:26.339
Caption: it today began in 1972 with Shelley

00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:28.319
Caption: Duvall and Robert Woodland

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:30.000
Caption: although the concept of self-awareness

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:31.799
Caption: is one that has been around for

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.140
Caption: centuries and people have been talking

00:08:31.799 --> 00:08:35.338
Caption: and trying to understand self for a very

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.098
Caption: long time

00:08:35.338 --> 00:08:40.500
Caption: but that theory from Shelley Duvall and

00:08:38.098 --> 00:08:43.739
Caption: Robert Wickland proposed that at a given

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.838
Caption: moment people can focus attention on

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:47.700
Caption: their self or on the external

00:08:45.838 --> 00:08:50.398
Caption: environment around them

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:53.820
Caption: and through their research they divided

00:08:50.398 --> 00:08:55.919
Caption: self-awareness into two sub-categories

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.200
Caption: the first is your internal

00:08:55.919 --> 00:09:01.079
Caption: self-awareness so this is the awareness

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.940
Caption: of your internal state of being and how

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.040
Caption: you are your emotions and how you&#39;re

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.919
Caption: reacting to things your natural

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:10.619
Caption: tendencies and generally we don&#39;t always

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:12.778
Caption: Focus internally or on ourselves but

00:09:10.619 --> 00:09:15.898
Caption: there&#39;s certain situations that can

00:09:12.778 --> 00:09:18.119
Caption: cause our attention to be drawn inward

00:09:15.898 --> 00:09:20.398
Caption: take for a moment to take a deep breath

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:23.518
Caption: breathe into your nose

00:09:20.398 --> 00:09:25.380
Caption: and out to your mouth

00:09:23.518 --> 00:09:27.359
Caption: most of the time you don&#39;t really think

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.799
Caption: about how you&#39;re breathing but because I

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:30.599
Caption: drew your attention to it and you

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:33.359
Caption: actively took that deep breath in and

00:09:30.599 --> 00:09:34.199
Caption: out you have become aware of your

00:09:33.359 --> 00:09:36.659
Caption: breathing

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.458
Caption: so internal self-awareness is something

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:40.559
Caption: that happens privately something inside

00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:42.059
Caption: our head of okay this is now how we&#39;re

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:44.099
Caption: breathing in and out

00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:45.838
Caption: it&#39;s the type of awareness when you

00:09:44.099 --> 00:09:48.179
Caption: become aware of some aspect of yourself

00:09:45.838 --> 00:09:49.979
Caption: but in a way that no one else can see

00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:51.898
Caption: because it&#39;s happening inside your mind

00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:52.919
Caption: so it&#39;s an awareness of that internal

00:09:51.898 --> 00:09:55.500
Caption: state

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:58.260
Caption: on the other hand is the external

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:01.260
Caption: self-awareness and what this means is

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.179
Caption: it&#39;s really our perceived awareness of

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.398
Caption: how others see us and it&#39;s only

00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:07.679
Caption: perceived because we don&#39;t actually 100

00:10:05.398 --> 00:10:10.080
Caption: know what other people are seeing in us

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:12.059
Caption: but we usually have some sort of idea or

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.679
Caption: maybe just a guess of what people are

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:15.838
Caption: seeing when maybe they&#39;re they&#39;re

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:17.338
Caption: watching us up on stage or we&#39;re

00:10:15.838 --> 00:10:19.380
Caption: interacting with them in a certain

00:10:17.338 --> 00:10:22.260
Caption: situations

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.239
Caption: for example here I am up here talking

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.880
Caption: and I can see you all looking at me and

00:10:24.239 --> 00:10:28.619
Caption: I&#39;m coming to some conclusions of what

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.660
Caption: you might be thinking

00:10:28.619 --> 00:10:33.719
Caption: when we know that we&#39;re being watched

00:10:30.659 --> 00:10:34.979
Caption: and evaluated we often try to act in

00:10:33.719 --> 00:10:36.119
Caption: ways that we think are socially

00:10:34.979 --> 00:10:37.739
Caption: acceptable

00:10:36.119 --> 00:10:39.479
Caption: so you&#39;re in a situation with your

00:10:37.739 --> 00:10:42.000
Caption: friends and someone says a joke that

00:10:39.479 --> 00:10:43.440
Caption: might be a bit controversial you&#39;ll

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.018
Caption: probably look around to your friends to

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.760
Caption: see how they react before you react as

00:10:46.018 --> 00:10:50.039
Caption: well so you want to make sure you fit

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.540
Caption: into those discolable norms and that&#39;s

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:53.099
Caption: an example of that external

00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:55.139
Caption: self-awareness

00:10:53.099 --> 00:10:57.479
Caption: so our external self-awareness is

00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:00.838
Caption: usually influences or actions to be

00:10:57.479 --> 00:11:03.059
Caption: related to society expectations where

00:11:00.838 --> 00:11:04.979
Caption: our internal self-awareness is really

00:11:03.059 --> 00:11:06.539
Caption: driven by our personal values and the

00:11:04.979 --> 00:11:08.940
Caption: things that really mean most to us

00:11:06.539 --> 00:11:12.958
Caption: internally

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:14.760
Caption: so Dr Tasha urch research self-awareness

00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:17.099
Caption: in the context of leaders and

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.559
Caption: organizations and took the concept of

00:11:17.099 --> 00:11:22.578
Caption: these internal and external and

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:25.799
Caption: categorized it into four separate

00:11:22.578 --> 00:11:28.500
Caption: sub-archetypes of self-awareness

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:30.778
Caption: so on the bottom left corner we have

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:35.039
Caption: what are called Seekers these people

00:11:30.778 --> 00:11:37.500
Caption: have the low internal and low external

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:39.479
Caption: so they don&#39;t really know too much about

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.539
Caption: themselves but they&#39;re open-minded and

00:11:39.479 --> 00:11:44.820
Caption: they&#39;re they&#39;re open to learning new

00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:46.979
Caption: things however they probably are getting

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.500
Caption: frustrated because they&#39;re not quite

00:11:46.979 --> 00:11:51.299
Caption: sure what they value and they might not

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.518
Caption: understand what might be happening in

00:11:51.299 --> 00:11:56.099
Caption: certain situations

00:11:53.518 --> 00:11:58.859
Caption: next we have on the top left corner

00:11:56.099 --> 00:12:00.059
Caption: those who have high internal and low

00:11:58.859 --> 00:12:02.518
Caption: external

00:12:00.059 --> 00:12:04.799
Caption: so these people are very clear on what

00:12:02.518 --> 00:12:07.260
Caption: is really most important to them but

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:08.880
Caption: they might not be as aware of how their

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.578
Caption: actions and things that they&#39;re doing

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.500
Caption: are perceived by others and often

00:12:11.578 --> 00:12:15.838
Caption: they&#39;re a bit close-minded and not open

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.539
Caption: to learning new things so that can harm

00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:20.518
Caption: some of the relationships with people

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:23.880
Caption: in the bottom right corner we have

00:12:20.518 --> 00:12:26.338
Caption: Pleasers these people are very highly

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.559
Caption: externally self-aware very aware of how

00:12:26.338 --> 00:12:30.719
Caption: other people are perceiving them but

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:33.059
Caption: there have low internal self-awareness

00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:36.199
Caption: so they&#39;re not as connected with what is

00:12:33.059 --> 00:12:39.119
Caption: important to them and can feel

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:41.579
Caption: frustrated and that can hold them back

00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:43.018
Caption: from getting success and fulfillment out

00:12:41.578 --> 00:12:44.940
Caption: of what they&#39;re doing

00:12:43.018 --> 00:12:47.458
Caption: and then the top right corner we have

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.919
Caption: those 10 to 15 of people who are truly

00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:52.338
Caption: self-aware they have the high internal

00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:54.539
Caption: and high external they really know

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:56.820
Caption: they&#39;re really in touch with who they

00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:58.440
Caption: are and what they really value but

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.539
Caption: they&#39;re also very aware of those around

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.119
Caption: them and they&#39;re aware how they can

00:13:00.539 --> 00:13:05.219
Caption: adapt to those current situations

00:13:03.119 --> 00:13:07.619
Caption: now it&#39;s all a scale and a lot of it

00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:09.419
Caption: depends on the situation all that but we

00:13:07.619 --> 00:13:12.299
Caption: can work on building our different parts

00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:15.179
Caption: of our self-awareness

00:13:12.299 --> 00:13:16.260
Caption: so if we&#39;re looking though some of those

00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:18.719
Caption: things that we&#39;re talking about the

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.278
Caption: self-awareness can be negative so if

00:13:18.719 --> 00:13:22.319
Caption: we&#39;re focusing on the wrong things if

00:13:20.278 --> 00:13:24.719
Caption: we&#39;re focusing term too much

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.760
Caption: internally we become maybe a bit

00:13:24.719 --> 00:13:28.619
Caption: self-obsessed or you have trouble

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.739
Caption: understanding you know challenging

00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:33.239
Caption: situations or things that might be out

00:13:31.739 --> 00:13:35.820
Caption: of the norm for us

00:13:33.239 --> 00:13:39.179
Caption: or if we&#39;re focusing too much externally

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:41.160
Caption: we can become quite anxious and always

00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:43.200
Caption: aware of things that other people are

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:45.719
Caption: judging us or things that are negatively

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.299
Caption: happening so we have to be careful with

00:13:45.719 --> 00:13:49.439
Caption: our our management of self-awareness

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:52.200
Caption: there&#39;s something that&#39;s called the

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.179
Caption: sadder but wiser paradox it says the

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.518
Caption: more we learn about ourselves it not

00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:57.838
Caption: only makes us wiser but it can also make

00:13:56.518 --> 00:14:01.320
Caption: us sadder

00:13:57.838 --> 00:14:02.760
Caption: so we need to change how we address the

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.160
Caption: self-awareness and make sure we&#39;re not

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.500
Caption: mulling over the negative emotions and

00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:08.759
Caption: instead reflecting objectively on the

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.039
Caption: positives

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.440
Caption: and we can do this by looking at the

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:16.018
Caption: questions that we&#39;re asking ourselves

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.239
Caption: we need to make sure our introspection

00:14:16.018 --> 00:14:19.919
Caption: is on that positive side because if we

00:14:18.239 --> 00:14:22.559
Caption: just start reflecting without the right

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:24.239
Caption: context it doesn&#39;t necessarily make us

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:26.638
Caption: happy it can make us worse because we&#39;re

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:28.679
Caption: focusing on the wrong things

00:14:26.638 --> 00:14:31.078
Caption: and research has shown that we&#39;re not

00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:33.539
Caption: able to pull up all of our unconscious

00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:35.458
Caption: thoughts feelings and emotions and as

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:37.799
Caption: you learn to think what keynote this

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:39.719
Caption: morning as well your memory can be wrong

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:41.398
Caption: you can if you&#39;re looking at something

00:14:39.719 --> 00:14:43.799
Caption: in a negative context and you&#39;re

00:14:41.398 --> 00:14:46.018
Caption: remembering it you can end up having

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:48.119
Caption: these negative emotions connected to it

00:14:46.018 --> 00:14:50.338
Caption: so we need to focus on moving forward

00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:52.739
Caption: and instead of fixating on what happens

00:14:50.338 --> 00:14:54.958
Caption: and we can do this by changing the

00:14:52.739 --> 00:14:57.179
Caption: questions that we ask ourselves instead

00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:59.338
Caption: of asking why we need to ask what

00:14:57.179 --> 00:15:02.099
Caption: instead of saying why me why did this

00:14:59.338 --> 00:15:05.039
Caption: happen look at what can I do to make it

00:15:02.099 --> 00:15:07.679
Caption: better what can I change what can I

00:15:05.039 --> 00:15:10.919
Caption: learn from this situation instead of

00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:13.380
Caption: asking why am I so upset look at what

00:15:10.919 --> 00:15:15.838
Caption: can make me happy what can I do to

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:18.479
Caption: change this situation focusing on

00:15:15.838 --> 00:15:20.698
Caption: becoming that aware archetype working on

00:15:18.479 --> 00:15:22.739
Caption: both the internal and external awareness

00:15:20.698 --> 00:15:24.838
Caption: looking at what we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re

00:15:22.739 --> 00:15:27.599
Caption: feeling and what are blind spots of what

00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:29.159
Caption: we might not be aware be

00:15:27.599 --> 00:15:31.198
Caption: and there&#39;s different tools that can

00:15:29.159 --> 00:15:33.059
Caption: help us do this one of them is What&#39;s

00:15:31.198 --> 00:15:36.479
Caption: called the Jahari window

00:15:33.059 --> 00:15:38.880
Caption: so this is an activity uh where you get

00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:40.979
Caption: a list of objectives that describe a

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.739
Caption: person so it can be something like

00:15:40.979 --> 00:15:46.440
Caption: cheerful excited maybe reserved

00:15:43.739 --> 00:15:48.958
Caption: something like that and you and a friend

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.398
Caption: go through the list and you Circle all

00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:52.380
Caption: the adjectives that you think describe

00:15:50.398 --> 00:15:54.599
Caption: yourself and your friend circles

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:58.018
Caption: adjectives that they think describes you

00:15:54.599 --> 00:16:01.198
Caption: you then compare the two lists and the

00:15:58.018 --> 00:16:02.940
Caption: adjectives that you both Circle are part

00:16:01.198 --> 00:16:04.198
Caption: of your external self so this is the

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.299
Caption: things that you&#39;re reflecting to others

00:16:04.198 --> 00:16:08.398
Caption: that they&#39;re aware of the things that

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:11.820
Caption: only use circled is that&#39;s your internal

00:16:08.398 --> 00:16:13.559
Caption: self things that you find you are are

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.199
Caption: part of you but maybe other people don&#39;t

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:18.419
Caption: see that then your blind spots are

00:16:16.198 --> 00:16:20.578
Caption: things that other people see in you but

00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:22.018
Caption: you don&#39;t necessarily seeing yourself

00:16:20.578 --> 00:16:23.338
Caption: so there&#39;s a few different tools and

00:16:22.018 --> 00:16:25.078
Caption: techniques that you can do to help you

00:16:23.338 --> 00:16:27.179
Caption: build up these skills

00:16:25.078 --> 00:16:29.398
Caption: and if we continue to do that reflection

00:16:27.179 --> 00:16:31.619
Caption: we can get the positives out of

00:16:29.398 --> 00:16:34.919
Caption: self-awareness we can change those

00:16:31.619 --> 00:16:36.000
Caption: questions from why to what and get an

00:16:34.919 --> 00:16:37.679
Caption: increased understanding of our

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.239
Caption: self-development needs and the things

00:16:37.679 --> 00:16:42.059
Caption: that we need to work on

00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:43.859
Caption: and that around us can help us become

00:16:42.059 --> 00:16:46.138
Caption: more proactive at work more

00:16:43.859 --> 00:16:48.000
Caption: understanding of others more open-minded

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:51.419
Caption: and willing to take on the initiative

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.958
Caption: and be able to do well in challenging

00:16:51.419 --> 00:16:57.479
Caption: situations or when faced with adversity

00:16:54.958 --> 00:17:00.838
Caption: it can make us become more successful

00:16:57.479 --> 00:17:03.059
Caption: and have more satisfied employees and

00:17:00.838 --> 00:17:04.918
Caption: teammates around us and it can even lead

00:17:03.059 --> 00:17:07.619
Caption: to organizations becoming more

00:17:04.918 --> 00:17:10.318
Caption: successful and profitable as well

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:12.540
Caption: so to develop these self-awareness

00:17:10.318 --> 00:17:14.578
Caption: skills there&#39;s other tools such as

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.600
Caption: understanding our internal self and our

00:17:14.578 --> 00:17:19.078
Caption: personality

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:21.660
Caption: so our personality is usually determined

00:17:19.078 --> 00:17:24.178
Caption: by our genetics but also environments

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:26.220
Caption: and situations and and how we&#39;re erased

00:17:24.178 --> 00:17:28.380
Caption: and it&#39;s the characteristic patterns of

00:17:26.219 --> 00:17:30.839
Caption: like how we think and behave and act in

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.940
Caption: certain situations and there&#39;s many

00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:34.739
Caption: different tools that can help us to

00:17:32.939 --> 00:17:35.879
Caption: understand a bit more about our

00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:37.979
Caption: personality

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.260
Caption: a lot of these might not be 100 correct

00:17:37.979 --> 00:17:42.298
Caption: and it might be influenced by the

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.500
Caption: situation in which you took the test but

00:17:42.298 --> 00:17:45.719
Caption: it can help guide you to understand

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.780
Caption: yourself a little bit more

00:17:45.719 --> 00:17:50.400
Caption: so one that I&#39;ve taken in the past that

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.799
Caption: I found useful was called the disc

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.080
Caption: Theory so this separates your

00:17:52.798 --> 00:17:58.319
Caption: personality into four trait and you get

00:17:55.079 --> 00:18:00.359
Caption: a report that shows how you might act in

00:17:58.319 --> 00:18:02.038
Caption: certain situations whether that&#39;s when

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:03.839
Caption: there&#39;s a conflict arising or you&#39;re

00:18:02.038 --> 00:18:05.459
Caption: faced with a challenge or you&#39;re doing

00:18:03.839 --> 00:18:07.500
Caption: something you really enjoy

00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:11.520
Caption: and breaks it down into four categories

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:13.380
Caption: first is more dominant which is someone

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.900
Caption: who&#39;s more results oriented

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:18.719
Caption: strong-willed or often Direct

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:21.900
Caption: is the influence being more optimistic

00:18:18.719 --> 00:18:23.819
Caption: Lively enthusiastic than steadiness

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.820
Caption: which is even tempered patient and

00:18:23.819 --> 00:18:28.079
Caption: tactful and then

00:18:25.819 --> 00:18:30.719
Caption: conscientiousness of trouble saying that

00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:32.099
Caption: word a bit more analytical and semantic

00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:34.619
Caption: as well

00:18:32.099 --> 00:18:37.319
Caption: and it&#39;s looking at really how you

00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:39.298
Caption: prefer to focus in on the world how you

00:18:37.319 --> 00:18:40.619
Caption: process information and react in

00:18:39.298 --> 00:18:42.239
Caption: different scenarios

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:43.678
Caption: and these Frameworks really just give

00:18:42.239 --> 00:18:45.839
Caption: you a better understanding of yourself

00:18:43.678 --> 00:18:48.659
Caption: but can also help you understand those

00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:50.099
Caption: around you so if you do these tests with

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.380
Caption: some of your team members and then

00:18:50.099 --> 00:18:54.298
Caption: compare the results it can really help

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.500
Caption: you to understand how you can work

00:18:54.298 --> 00:18:57.899
Caption: better together

00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:00.418
Caption: at a situation where I had a colleague

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.460
Caption: who was in a similar position of mine

00:19:00.418 --> 00:19:05.399
Caption: and we&#39;re often working together but

00:19:02.459 --> 00:19:07.859
Caption: constantly butting heads I had a hard

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.140
Caption: time communicating with her and really

00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:11.760
Caption: just you know underst difficulty

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.020
Caption: understanding her approach to different

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.020
Caption: situations

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:18.660
Caption: but we took this test and compared our

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:20.820
Caption: results and she was super high on the D

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.859
Caption: side the D and C side and I was really

00:19:20.819 --> 00:19:25.739
Caption: high on the S and I side so completely

00:19:22.859 --> 00:19:27.359
Caption: opposite scales of the spectrum

00:19:25.739 --> 00:19:29.219
Caption: but because of this I was able to

00:19:27.359 --> 00:19:31.260
Caption: understand her a little bit better and

00:19:29.219 --> 00:19:33.359
Caption: that allowed me to then adjust my

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.979
Caption: Approach when I was working with her and

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:37.798
Caption: understand a bit more when she was

00:19:34.979 --> 00:19:41.459
Caption: communicating with me in a way that I

00:19:37.798 --> 00:19:43.199
Caption: naturally did not enjoy as much so it

00:19:41.459 --> 00:19:44.819
Caption: helped us work better together in the

00:19:43.199 --> 00:19:46.979
Caption: end

00:19:44.819 --> 00:19:49.380
Caption: along with understanding our personality

00:19:46.979 --> 00:19:51.418
Caption: type we can help to understand our

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.579
Caption: leadership styles and look at developing

00:19:51.418 --> 00:19:55.439
Caption: different types of leadership styles and

00:19:53.579 --> 00:19:58.140
Caption: adjusting them depending on our

00:19:55.439 --> 00:20:02.038
Caption: situation with our organization

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:05.820
Caption: this is called the full range Leadership

00:20:02.038 --> 00:20:08.219
Caption: Model and it&#39;s really dividing into uh

00:20:05.819 --> 00:20:10.619
Caption: four or three types one that&#39;s lit

00:20:08.219 --> 00:20:12.239
Caption: across to subcategories and the first

00:20:10.619 --> 00:20:14.939
Caption: leadership type is What&#39;s called the

00:20:12.239 --> 00:20:17.280
Caption: laissez-faire and this is really giving

00:20:14.939 --> 00:20:19.558
Caption: the empowerment to your team members and

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.479
Caption: those around you this is letting them

00:20:19.558 --> 00:20:23.880
Caption: make the decisions and really empowering

00:20:21.479 --> 00:20:26.400
Caption: them so it&#39;s the the least sort of

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:29.099
Caption: Hands-On and it&#39;s really good if your

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:31.020
Caption: team is really highly skilled and highly

00:20:29.099 --> 00:20:32.880
Caption: experienced and trustworthy to reach

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.440
Caption: that goal really empowering them to be

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.839
Caption: the leaders themselves

00:20:34.439 --> 00:20:39.959
Caption: the next is the transactional leadership

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:41.880
Caption: which is more about motivating through a

00:20:39.959 --> 00:20:43.500
Caption: system of rewards and and maybe

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.140
Caption: punishments

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:49.020
Caption: um and that&#39;s broken into categories of

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:51.119
Caption: where management only steps in uh if the

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.619
Caption: team isn&#39;t doing well otherwise lets

00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:55.819
Caption: them keep going and giving them rewards

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:58.619
Caption: and the other is focused on that reward

00:20:55.819 --> 00:21:01.380
Caption: of the objectives

00:20:58.619 --> 00:21:03.839
Caption: this is good if your organization is

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.239
Caption: really wanting to standardize practices

00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:09.599
Caption: and developing at on a journey of

00:21:06.239 --> 00:21:10.798
Caption: becoming a highly effective operating

00:21:09.599 --> 00:21:13.619
Caption: team

00:21:10.798 --> 00:21:15.899
Caption: and it yeah it&#39;s helpful it helps for

00:21:13.619 --> 00:21:18.058
Caption: standardizing those practices the the

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.099
Caption: last type is the transformational

00:21:18.058 --> 00:21:24.178
Caption: leadership this is about really being

00:21:20.099 --> 00:21:26.520
Caption: that inspirational motivation Visionary

00:21:24.178 --> 00:21:28.739
Caption: role model that people look for and has

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.959
Caption: been proven to be the most effective

00:21:28.739 --> 00:21:33.500
Caption: uh it has more of a humanitarian

00:21:30.959 --> 00:21:35.579
Caption: approach and it&#39;s really underpinned by

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:39.000
Caption: self-awareness as well

00:21:35.579 --> 00:21:40.558
Caption: so these different types you can have

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.418
Caption: different styles and you can also adapt

00:21:40.558 --> 00:21:44.219
Caption: and change your style it&#39;s important to

00:21:42.418 --> 00:21:46.079
Caption: get an understanding of how do you like

00:21:44.219 --> 00:21:49.260
Caption: to lead others

00:21:46.079 --> 00:21:51.260
Caption: we can also look to develop our

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:53.820
Caption: leadership skills such as communication

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:55.500
Caption: research has found that communication is

00:21:53.819 --> 00:21:57.359
Caption: Central to leadership

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:00.678
Caption: internal Communication in an

00:21:57.359 --> 00:22:05.038
Caption: organization can significantly increase

00:22:00.678 --> 00:22:08.519
Caption: a someone&#39;s your team&#39;s productivity

00:22:05.038 --> 00:22:12.538
Caption: and there is also a theory that

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:13.619
Caption: communication and a message is seven

00:22:12.538 --> 00:22:19.019
Caption: percent

00:22:13.619 --> 00:22:20.219
Caption: verbal 38 tone in expression and 55 body

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.739
Caption: language

00:22:20.219 --> 00:22:25.020
Caption: so there is a bit of a debate on the

00:22:22.739 --> 00:22:26.520
Caption: exact percentages that everything goes

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.940
Caption: across but there&#39;s a general

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:32.520
Caption: understanding that 70 to 90 percent of

00:22:29.939 --> 00:22:34.558
Caption: communication is non-verbal so that

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.299
Caption: means it&#39;s really important for us to

00:22:34.558 --> 00:22:38.880
Caption: think about how we&#39;re delivering

00:22:36.298 --> 00:22:41.279
Caption: messages to our teammates are you just

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.558
Caption: sending an email with an important team

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.960
Caption: update or are you putting out a video or

00:22:43.558 --> 00:22:47.819
Caption: maybe jumping on a video call and a chat

00:22:45.959 --> 00:22:49.739
Caption: think about how you like to be

00:22:47.819 --> 00:22:51.119
Caption: communicated to as well

00:22:49.739 --> 00:22:54.000
Caption: do you like to have all of the

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:55.380
Caption: information up front before a meeting or

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.140
Caption: do you like to just have a short quick

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.880
Caption: summary and understand that and

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.859
Caption: communicate it back to your team which

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.819
Caption: means they will in turn work better with

00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:05.280
Caption: you

00:23:02.819 --> 00:23:07.558
Caption: especially now that we&#39;re in you know

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:10.140
Caption: pretty much a lot of remote based

00:23:07.558 --> 00:23:11.819
Caption: working situations that communication is

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:14.219
Caption: very important and using all the

00:23:11.819 --> 00:23:16.259
Caption: different tools that we have to keep our

00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:17.819
Caption: communication styles from just being

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:21.260
Caption: verbal and using those tone and

00:23:17.819 --> 00:23:24.899
Caption: expressions as well using all of the

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:26.880
Caption: gifts and little icons slack reacts

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:29.099
Caption: whatever it may be to show your emotion

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.780
Caption: throughout your communication

00:23:29.099 --> 00:23:32.400
Caption: this can help you connect better with

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.679
Caption: your friends colleagues and your team

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.000

00:23:34.678 --> 00:23:38.579

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.500
Caption: communication

00:23:38.579 --> 00:23:42.599
Caption: for me the next most important

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:45.000
Caption: leadership skill that&#39;s underpinned by

00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:48.479
Caption: self-awareness is emotional intelligence

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.640
Caption: this is sometimes referred to as EQ

00:23:48.479 --> 00:23:52.859
Caption: and the first thing that is essential

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.020
Caption: for any degree of emotional intelligence

00:23:52.859 --> 00:23:56.158
Caption: is that self-awareness and understanding

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.959
Caption: of herself

00:23:56.159 --> 00:23:59.700
Caption: because emotional intelligence is all

00:23:57.959 --> 00:24:01.798
Caption: about being able to recognize our

00:23:59.699 --> 00:24:04.079
Caption: emotions to understand the merchants

00:24:01.798 --> 00:24:06.298
Caption: that we may be feeling but also how we

00:24:04.079 --> 00:24:09.058
Caption: react when we&#39;re feeling these emotions

00:24:06.298 --> 00:24:11.579
Caption: and the next step is then being able to

00:24:09.058 --> 00:24:12.899
Caption: control those emotions in those

00:24:11.579 --> 00:24:14.939
Caption: situations

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:17.339
Caption: so there are four components of

00:24:14.939 --> 00:24:19.439
Caption: emotional intelligence the first is

00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:21.719
Caption: self-awareness so self-awareness is a

00:24:19.439 --> 00:24:24.479
Caption: sub-category of emotional intelligence

00:24:21.719 --> 00:24:27.418
Caption: but it&#39;s really focused on the

00:24:24.479 --> 00:24:30.298
Caption: self-awareness of your emotions are you

00:24:27.418 --> 00:24:33.839
Caption: feeling happy anxious angry scared

00:24:30.298 --> 00:24:37.439
Caption: excited what emotion are you feeling

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:39.298
Caption: the next is the self-management so

00:24:37.439 --> 00:24:41.279
Caption: that&#39;s being able to then control those

00:24:39.298 --> 00:24:43.619
Caption: emotions especially in a workplace

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.179
Caption: organization if there&#39;s something that

00:24:43.619 --> 00:24:48.239
Caption: makes you angry you don&#39;t want to lash

00:24:45.178 --> 00:24:50.339
Caption: out and create a negative situation you

00:24:48.239 --> 00:24:52.199
Caption: want to be able to control those you

00:24:50.339 --> 00:24:55.619
Caption: also need to be able to adapt when

00:24:52.199 --> 00:24:57.359
Caption: things are changing and to have a

00:24:55.619 --> 00:24:58.678
Caption: positive outlook on things that are

00:24:57.359 --> 00:25:00.780
Caption: happening as well

00:24:58.678 --> 00:25:03.479
Caption: the next step is that social awareness

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:05.880
Caption: so really being empathetic to those

00:25:03.479 --> 00:25:08.459
Caption: around you and to the team you can break

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:11.280
Caption: empathy down into three parts the first

00:25:08.459 --> 00:25:14.219
Caption: is cognitive which is all about I know

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.539
Caption: how you think the next is emotional I

00:25:14.219 --> 00:25:18.359
Caption: know how you feel

00:25:15.538 --> 00:25:20.158
Caption: and the next is empathetic concern which

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:22.319
Caption: is I care about you

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:24.240
Caption: and great leaders are those that can

00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:25.979
Caption: really be empathetic to you in those

00:25:24.239 --> 00:25:27.839
Caption: different situations we talked about

00:25:25.979 --> 00:25:31.319
Caption: being understanding being supportive

00:25:27.839 --> 00:25:33.239
Caption: especially in times like through covid

00:25:31.319 --> 00:25:35.339
Caption: we have you know our kids that we&#39;re

00:25:33.239 --> 00:25:36.599
Caption: looking after or we have family members

00:25:35.339 --> 00:25:38.880
Caption: that might be unwell it&#39;s really

00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:40.979
Caption: important to have empathetic and

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.500
Caption: emotionally intelligent leaders

00:25:40.979 --> 00:25:45.599
Caption: and in turn this also is important for

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.159
Caption: organizational awareness if something

00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:48.719
Caption: negative is happening with your

00:25:47.159 --> 00:25:51.000
Caption: organization or your team is

00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:53.219
Caption: collectively experienced some sort of

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.439
Caption: emotion being aware of that and then

00:25:53.219 --> 00:25:58.859
Caption: also being aware of how you can help

00:25:55.439 --> 00:26:01.439
Caption: address it and how you can manage those

00:25:58.859 --> 00:26:03.778
Caption: emotions in the team by being an

00:26:01.439 --> 00:26:05.459
Caption: influencer by being a coach or a mentor

00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:07.860
Caption: and helping other people then in turn

00:26:05.459 --> 00:26:09.599
Caption: manage their emotions being a diffuser

00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:11.819
Caption: in certain situations or helping to

00:26:09.599 --> 00:26:13.859
Caption: uplift your team when things might not

00:26:11.819 --> 00:26:16.619
Caption: be going so well

00:26:13.859 --> 00:26:18.298
Caption: so harnessing these emotions can really

00:26:16.619 --> 00:26:21.119
Caption: help us to achieve our goal and it&#39;s all

00:26:18.298 --> 00:26:23.639
Caption: underpinned by that self-awareness

00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:26.579
Caption: so emotional intelligence is super

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:28.200
Caption: important as we said we want people who

00:26:26.579 --> 00:26:29.819
Caption: are more empathetic who are more

00:26:28.199 --> 00:26:31.918
Caption: understanding and can really relate to

00:26:29.819 --> 00:26:34.739
Caption: us in different situations

00:26:31.918 --> 00:26:36.719
Caption: we need to make sure that there is some

00:26:34.739 --> 00:26:37.500
Caption: sort of work-life balance there are

00:26:36.719 --> 00:26:39.418
Caption: people

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.400
Caption: and that we can handle change because

00:26:39.418 --> 00:26:43.859
Caption: we&#39;re in a very rapidly changing type of

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.960
Caption: environment especially in Tech

00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:48.178
Caption: so people with high emotional

00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:49.439
Caption: intelligence are naturally curious and

00:26:48.178 --> 00:26:51.479
Caption: they&#39;re not afraid to ask questions

00:26:49.439 --> 00:26:53.219
Caption: they&#39;re able to empathize with their

00:26:51.479 --> 00:26:55.260
Caption: teammates around them put themselves in

00:26:53.219 --> 00:26:57.298
Caption: the shoes of others and really diffuse

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.940
Caption: any sort of situation when you&#39;re

00:26:57.298 --> 00:27:01.739
Caption: emotionally intelligent it&#39;ll help your

00:26:59.939 --> 00:27:04.678
Caption: team members be emotionally intelligent

00:27:01.739 --> 00:27:06.359
Caption: too to come to you when they need that

00:27:04.678 --> 00:27:07.859
Caption: support or when they have things that

00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:10.079
Caption: they&#39;re uncertain about because they

00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:12.119
Caption: know that you will be there to help them

00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:13.558
Caption: make it through and you&#39;ll be able to

00:27:12.119 --> 00:27:15.900
Caption: make those really strong connections

00:27:13.558 --> 00:27:17.339

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.979

Caption: so how can you increase your emotional

00:27:19.979 --> 00:27:24.719
Caption: intelligence well one way to do this is

00:27:22.678 --> 00:27:26.760
Caption: just by starting to write a list of all

00:27:24.719 --> 00:27:28.859
Caption: the different emotions that you know and

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:31.020

00:27:28.859 --> 00:27:32.459
Caption: expanding your emotional vocabulary can

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.440
Caption: really help you with then in turn

00:27:32.459 --> 00:27:36.298
Caption: identifying your emotions

00:27:34.439 --> 00:27:37.918
Caption: go out and research different types of

00:27:36.298 --> 00:27:40.380
Caption: emotions and see if you&#39;re able to

00:27:37.918 --> 00:27:42.359
Caption: identify them and yourselves so just

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:46.260

Caption: and then take the time to observe

00:27:48.178 --> 00:27:52.500
Caption: however you&#39;re reacting in different

00:27:49.979 --> 00:27:54.900
Caption: situations especially if things maybe

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.979
Caption: didn&#39;t go so well maybe there was

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.619
Caption: something that made you really

00:27:55.979 --> 00:28:00.959
Caption: frustrated and you ended up reacting

00:27:58.619 --> 00:28:02.699
Caption: negatively take a step back to reflect

00:28:00.959 --> 00:28:04.859
Caption: and think about how you could have

00:28:02.699 --> 00:28:07.380
Caption: handled that situation differently what

00:28:04.859 --> 00:28:08.760

Caption: how can you prevent that negative

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:14.099
Caption: reaction in the future

00:28:11.219 --> 00:28:16.140

Caption: well everyone&#39;s definition of hard is

00:28:21.119 --> 00:28:25.859
Caption: different so even though someone might

00:28:23.579 --> 00:28:27.418
Caption: be struggling with it try to take a

00:28:25.859 --> 00:28:30.178
Caption: moment to put yourself in their shoes

00:28:27.418 --> 00:28:32.099
Caption: and understand how they might be feeling

00:28:30.178 --> 00:28:34.979

00:28:32.099 --> 00:28:36.900

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:41.279

00:28:48.779 --> 00:28:53.039

00:29:03.359 --> 00:29:08.278
Caption: called self leadership and this is

00:29:05.819 --> 00:29:10.979

00:29:10.979 --> 00:29:15.119

Caption: few different key strategies the first

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:40.440

Caption: to be a great leader

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:35.159

00:30:33.779 --> 00:30:38.340
Caption: help you define

00:30:35.159 --> 00:30:40.799

00:30:38.339 --> 00:30:44.099

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:56.359
Caption: to the team members around you

00:30:54.839 --> 00:30:59.158

00:30:59.159 --> 00:31:05.279
Caption: belief in their capabilities to execute

00:31:02.279 --> 00:31:07.559

00:31:05.279 --> 00:31:09.119
Caption: belief in your own ability to succeed

00:31:07.558 --> 00:31:10.739

00:31:18.418 --> 00:31:23.579
Caption: you&#39;re more likely to take on challenges

00:31:20.699 --> 00:31:26.339
Caption: and be better in difficult situations

00:31:23.579 --> 00:31:28.079

00:31:26.339 --> 00:31:29.579
Caption: inspiration and role model see how

00:31:28.079 --> 00:31:32.099
Caption: you&#39;ve handled those negative situations

00:31:29.579 --> 00:31:34.439
Caption: see how you&#39;re able to continue to keep

00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:38.778

00:31:39.359 --> 00:31:44.760
Caption: you can develop self-efficacy through

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.979
Caption: experience by seeing those people and

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.839
Caption: supporting other people around you so

00:31:46.979 --> 00:31:51.418

00:31:48.839 --> 00:31:53.880
Caption: well and it&#39;ll help them develop their

00:31:51.418 --> 00:31:56.158
Caption: self-efficacy so working on all these

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.859
Caption: skills can make us more confident

00:31:56.159 --> 00:32:01.980
Caption: stronger leaders

00:31:58.859 --> 00:32:03.959
Caption: so in turn our benefit our followers who

00:32:01.979 --> 00:32:05.278
Caption: are following us will then benefit from

00:32:03.959 --> 00:32:07.140
Caption: all these different skills that we&#39;ve

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:08.940
Caption: been working on within ourselves in our

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.859
Caption: awareness of ourself

00:32:08.939 --> 00:32:12.839
Caption: the followers are very important because

00:32:10.859 --> 00:32:13.979
Caption: they&#39;re the ones who made us leaders in

00:32:12.839 --> 00:32:16.558
Caption: the first place

00:32:13.979 --> 00:32:19.859
Caption: they look up to us and they really rely

00:32:16.558 --> 00:32:21.418
Caption: on us to to help them succeed as well so

00:32:19.859 --> 00:32:23.459
Caption: share your knowledge encourage your team

00:32:21.418 --> 00:32:24.959
Caption: to reflect any of those things that

00:32:23.459 --> 00:32:26.880
Caption: you&#39;re learning about yourself share

00:32:24.959 --> 00:32:29.339
Caption: with your teams so that they can then in

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:32.339
Caption: turn understand and maybe reflect on how

00:32:29.339 --> 00:32:35.219
Caption: they act in certain situations as well

00:32:32.339 --> 00:32:38.158
Caption: make sure you coach and instead of just

00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:41.038
Caption: giving people the answers I had a

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:43.740
Caption: colleague who would always just answer

00:32:41.038 --> 00:32:45.298
Caption: any of my questions with a question when

00:32:43.739 --> 00:32:47.038
Caption: I asked him for advice

00:32:45.298 --> 00:32:49.439
Caption: I would come up to him and say hey

00:32:47.038 --> 00:32:51.658
Caption: should I apply for this raila leadership

00:32:49.439 --> 00:32:54.599
Caption: camp and you&#39;d be like well what do you

00:32:51.659 --> 00:32:55.559
Caption: think and say okay uh well I think it&#39;d

00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:57.418
Caption: be fine I think it&#39;d be a good

00:32:55.558 --> 00:32:59.520
Caption: experience well why do you think that

00:32:57.418 --> 00:33:02.158
Caption: and it would just keep going on and on

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.260
Caption: to where eventually I would then just

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:05.940
Caption: answer my own question but it also

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.520
Caption: encouraged that introspection in self

00:33:05.939 --> 00:33:10.678
Caption: reflection which made me also understand

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.479
Caption: what was really valuable to me and make

00:33:10.678 --> 00:33:14.939
Caption: sure that I was creating these goals for

00:33:12.479 --> 00:33:17.158
Caption: myself and moving myself forward

00:33:14.939 --> 00:33:18.839
Caption: so those those different techniques that

00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:20.880
Caption: you can do to help Inspire your

00:33:18.839 --> 00:33:21.959
Caption: followers but that&#39;s one that I always

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.899
Caption: enjoy

00:33:21.959 --> 00:33:27.418
Caption: and also there&#39;s actually a study that

00:33:24.899 --> 00:33:30.239
Caption: was published just last year that proves

00:33:27.418 --> 00:33:33.119
Caption: that your followers will benefit from

00:33:30.239 --> 00:33:36.058
Caption: your leadership of your a Leader&#39;s

00:33:33.119 --> 00:33:39.178
Caption: self-awareness so if a leader has strong

00:33:36.058 --> 00:33:41.278
Caption: self-awareness this will naturally lead

00:33:39.178 --> 00:33:43.678
Caption: to followers being self-leaders because

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:45.840
Caption: they&#39;ll see the guidance and inspiration

00:33:43.678 --> 00:33:47.699
Caption: from those leaders around them where the

00:33:45.839 --> 00:33:49.260
Caption: leaders are you&#39;re talking about goal

00:33:47.699 --> 00:33:52.199
Caption: setting and these kind of things like

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:53.940
Caption: that a follower will then start to set

00:33:52.199 --> 00:33:55.380
Caption: these goals for themselves and drive

00:33:53.939 --> 00:33:58.259
Caption: themselves forward

00:33:55.380 --> 00:34:00.058
Caption: in turn that will make the leader more

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:03.000
Caption: confident they&#39;ll have greater

00:34:00.058 --> 00:34:05.038
Caption: self-efficacy and they&#39;ll continue to be

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.178
Caption: better leaders and reflect that back to

00:34:05.038 --> 00:34:08.819
Caption: their followers

00:34:06.178 --> 00:34:12.118
Caption: and they also found that this continues

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:14.820
Caption: on so that their followers are then more

00:34:12.118 --> 00:34:16.618
Caption: likely to become leaders themselves they

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.719
Caption: see the role models and the actions that

00:34:16.618 --> 00:34:20.579
Caption: you&#39;re doing as a leader and they become

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:22.260
Caption: they&#39;re more likely to become a leader

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.000
Caption: and they&#39;re also more likely to be

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:26.760
Caption: nominated for a promotion more

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.979
Caption: successful in their career so through

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.359
Caption: working through your self-awareness your

00:34:28.979 --> 00:34:32.760
Caption: team and your colleagues and people

00:34:30.358 --> 00:34:34.138
Caption: around you will become better leaders as

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:36.479
Caption: well

00:34:34.138 --> 00:34:38.638
Caption: and not only will your team become

00:34:36.479 --> 00:34:40.020
Caption: better leaders but your organization and

00:34:38.638 --> 00:34:42.658
Caption: the company that you&#39;re working for will

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:45.119
Caption: benefit from this as well and research

00:34:42.658 --> 00:34:47.760
Caption: research has demonstrated that

00:34:45.118 --> 00:34:49.939
Caption: leadership behavior is really influenced

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.320
Caption: the overall performance of a company

00:34:49.939 --> 00:34:54.178
Caption: workers are more trusting as software

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.560
Caption: leaders because those leaders are are

00:34:54.178 --> 00:34:57.479
Caption: empathetic they&#39;re people that we can

00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:00.119
Caption: approach their problems we can be open

00:34:57.479 --> 00:35:02.098
Caption: about when things are going wrong we can

00:35:00.118 --> 00:35:03.659
Caption: talk about you know failures and but

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:06.119
Caption: look at them in a positive light and

00:35:03.659 --> 00:35:08.760
Caption: learn from it and move forward

00:35:06.118 --> 00:35:10.799
Caption: Maya Angelou said I&#39;ve learned that

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.439
Caption: people will forget what you said people

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:16.020
Caption: will forget what you did but people will

00:35:13.439 --> 00:35:18.179
Caption: never forget how you made them feel

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:21.000
Caption: self-awire leaders and teammates can

00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:22.739
Caption: really make an impact and be more

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.320
Caption: engaged in their work and in the end

00:35:22.739 --> 00:35:28.199
Caption: produce better results

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:30.540
Caption: so we can build self-awareness first by

00:35:28.199 --> 00:35:32.760
Caption: understanding ourselves practicing and

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:35.099
Caption: re-evaluating ourselves in the context

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.839
Caption: of others using different tools to learn

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:38.780
Caption: about how we approach different

00:35:36.839 --> 00:35:41.460
Caption: situations what are our natural

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:43.500
Caption: personality types what are our strengths

00:35:41.459 --> 00:35:44.939
Caption: and weaknesses what are some areas that

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.800
Caption: we need to work on and when do we need

00:35:44.939 --> 00:35:50.219
Caption: to rely on others

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:53.099
Caption: they actually found that people

00:35:50.219 --> 00:35:55.320
Caption: can build self-awareness by putting

00:35:53.099 --> 00:35:58.440
Caption: themselves in situations where their

00:35:55.320 --> 00:36:00.540
Caption: focus is naturally drawn inward they did

00:35:58.439 --> 00:36:02.219
Caption: this by putting people in front of Amir

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:04.260
Caption: and recording them and recording their

00:36:02.219 --> 00:36:05.939
Caption: actions and then having them watch

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.159
Caption: themselves back

00:36:05.939 --> 00:36:10.858
Caption: so as as much as a lot of us hate

00:36:08.159 --> 00:36:13.319
Caption: watching ourselves this really helps us

00:36:10.858 --> 00:36:14.939
Caption: to become self-aware whenever I do a

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.040
Caption: presentation I always go back and watch

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:18.780
Caption: the recording because that helps me

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.640
Caption: learn the things that I need to work on

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.919
Caption: and things that I can improve for next

00:36:20.639 --> 00:36:25.199
Caption: time so put yourself in those situations

00:36:22.919 --> 00:36:27.479
Caption: where you&#39;re being drawn to your

00:36:25.199 --> 00:36:29.699
Caption: yourself and you&#39;re seeing thinking

00:36:27.479 --> 00:36:31.858
Caption: about or understanding how you&#39;ve acted

00:36:29.699 --> 00:36:33.419
Caption: in different situations to help build

00:36:31.858 --> 00:36:34.739
Caption: that self-awareness

00:36:33.419 --> 00:36:36.479
Caption: there&#39;s also things called

00:36:34.739 --> 00:36:38.520
Caption: self-awareness triggers which are

00:36:36.479 --> 00:36:41.159
Caption: usually some big events that happen in

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:43.919
Caption: our life they really make us reflect and

00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:46.319
Caption: understand a bit of ourselves on a

00:36:43.919 --> 00:36:48.239
Caption: deeper level but these are only really

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.699
Caption: beneficial to helping our self-awareness

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:52.858
Caption: if we take that time to reflect to think

00:36:50.699 --> 00:36:55.020
Caption: about how did we react in that situation

00:36:52.858 --> 00:36:56.879
Caption: how did we handle that how could what

00:36:55.020 --> 00:37:00.179
Caption: could we have done differently change

00:36:56.879 --> 00:37:02.039
Caption: those questions from why to what take

00:37:00.179 --> 00:37:03.540
Caption: those tests talk to the people around

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.820
Caption: you you get that feedback from your

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.699
Caption: teammates as well to help build that

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:10.680
Caption: external self-awareness and understand

00:37:07.699 --> 00:37:12.540
Caption: how you are perceived by others and

00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:15.239
Caption: those around you

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.219
Caption: do you need to work more on your

00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:18.959
Caption: mindfulness do you need to build up that

00:37:17.219 --> 00:37:20.699
Caption: emotional intelligence do you need to

00:37:18.959 --> 00:37:22.320
Caption: sort of control your emotions in

00:37:20.699 --> 00:37:25.439
Caption: different situations what are you really

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:27.300
Caption: good at maybe how do you need to alter

00:37:25.439 --> 00:37:28.319
Caption: your communication for certain team

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.540
Caption: members

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.959
Caption: take a step back slow down your emotions

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:35.939
Caption: boil and practice that self-regulation

00:37:33.959 --> 00:37:38.219
Caption: so in summary we learned about

00:37:35.939 --> 00:37:40.139
Caption: leadership and that anyone can be a

00:37:38.219 --> 00:37:42.118
Caption: leader we can all build up our

00:37:40.139 --> 00:37:44.519
Caption: self-awareness and that can drive us to

00:37:42.118 --> 00:37:46.139
Caption: become better leaders and in turn our

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.119
Caption: followers and our teammates and those

00:37:46.139 --> 00:37:50.039
Caption: people around us are more likely to

00:37:48.118 --> 00:37:53.098
Caption: become leaders as well

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.839
Caption: we learned how self-awareness can be

00:37:53.099 --> 00:37:56.220
Caption: negative if we don&#39;t think about it in

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:58.680
Caption: the right aspect

00:37:56.219 --> 00:38:00.959
Caption: so we need and we don&#39;t focus on both

00:37:58.679 --> 00:38:03.300
Caption: the internal and external so we need to

00:38:00.959 --> 00:38:05.520
Caption: to balance those two sides and practice

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.979
Caption: that positive self-talk change our

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.500
Caption: questions from why to what and look at

00:38:07.979 --> 00:38:12.358
Caption: how we can learn and move forward

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:15.419
Caption: we heard how self-awareness can be

00:38:12.358 --> 00:38:18.059
Caption: beneficial to ourselves our team and our

00:38:15.419 --> 00:38:20.760
Caption: organization so through self-awareness

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:23.880
Caption: you can be a great leader

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:26.820

Caption: hello great talk Melissa

00:39:06.959 --> 00:39:10.379
Caption: um so you mentioned failures and looking

00:39:08.639 --> 00:39:12.419
Caption: at them in a positive light do you have

00:39:10.379 --> 00:39:14.779
Caption: any recent examples of situations you&#39;ve

00:39:12.419 --> 00:39:14.780
Caption: done that

00:39:15.358 --> 00:39:19.019
Caption: so looking at things in a positive

00:39:17.459 --> 00:39:20.338
Caption: flight

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:21.659
Caption: yeah

00:39:20.339 --> 00:39:24.540
Caption: um

00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:26.219
Caption: yeah well so for example you know I so

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.199
Caption: living in Melbourne

00:39:26.219 --> 00:39:31.139
Caption: um in the pandemic we had you know

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:33.598
Caption: really intense lockdowns that were you

00:39:31.139 --> 00:39:35.039
Caption: know quite difficult to work with

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:37.140
Caption: um and so there was a lot of negative

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.219
Caption: emotions and negative things happening

00:39:37.139 --> 00:39:40.439
Caption: with

00:39:38.219 --> 00:39:42.179
Caption: um the lockdowns and it was a struggle

00:39:40.439 --> 00:39:45.118
Caption: to to manage

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:47.520
Caption: um during that scenario but on I try to

00:39:45.118 --> 00:39:49.319
Caption: reflect on it in a positive light on the

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:52.500
Caption: things that I was able to achieve over

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:56.160
Caption: that time so even though you know it was

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:58.260
Caption: a a really difficult time in my life I

00:39:56.159 --> 00:40:00.118
Caption: was able to focus on things like

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:03.359
Caption: practicing public speaking and doing

00:40:00.118 --> 00:40:04.919
Caption: virtual talks and learning more about

00:40:03.358 --> 00:40:06.739
Caption: myself and doing more of that

00:40:04.919 --> 00:40:10.078
Caption: self-reflection and everything as well

00:40:06.739 --> 00:40:12.598
Caption: so instead of focusing on sort of the

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:15.420
Caption: negative things of being stuck in your

00:40:12.599 --> 00:40:17.460
Caption: house nothing to see people I focused on

00:40:15.419 --> 00:40:18.959
Caption: the things that I was able to achieve

00:40:17.459 --> 00:40:21.719
Caption: despite

00:40:18.959 --> 00:40:24.179
Caption: um you know being in a situation even if

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:25.919
Caption: it wasn&#39;t every day that I was able to

00:40:24.179 --> 00:40:27.300
Caption: you know be super productive there&#39;s

00:40:25.919 --> 00:40:29.040
Caption: definitely a lot of days that were spent

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:31.739
Caption: you know just sitting on the couch being

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:33.479
Caption: a bit miserable focusing on the days

00:40:31.739 --> 00:40:37.339
Caption: that were positive where I was able to

00:40:33.479 --> 00:40:37.338
Caption: achieve something despite the situation

00:40:46.219 --> 00:40:52.500
Caption: I you told about one of your colleagues

00:40:49.858 --> 00:40:55.858
Caption: or one of your maybe one of your

00:40:52.500 --> 00:41:00.118
Caption: colleagues where your colleague was uh

00:40:55.858 --> 00:41:03.358
Caption: kind of more dominating in in her

00:41:00.118 --> 00:41:05.578
Caption: personality so how did you get get about

00:41:03.358 --> 00:41:07.559
Caption: it get around it because you did tell

00:41:05.579 --> 00:41:10.979
Caption: that you did some certain strategies

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:12.900
Caption: around it but in that situation what

00:41:10.979 --> 00:41:14.639
Caption: kind of strategies did you use because

00:41:12.899 --> 00:41:18.239
Caption: that was something which didn&#39;t you

00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:20.578
Caption: didn&#39;t elaborate on it yep yeah so the

00:41:18.239 --> 00:41:23.459
Caption: the colleague was a bit more dominating

00:41:20.579 --> 00:41:25.800
Caption: and indirects whereas I&#39;m naturally

00:41:23.459 --> 00:41:28.560
Caption: um a bit more I I guess

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:30.239
Caption: um yeah sort of Less Direct in my

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.699
Caption: approach to things

00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:34.500
Caption: um so I well part of it was when I was

00:41:32.699 --> 00:41:36.479
Caption: communicating with her I made sure that

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.320
Caption: I was very direct and straight to the

00:41:36.479 --> 00:41:38.879
Caption: point

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.920
Caption: um so that she would understand the

00:41:38.879 --> 00:41:43.379
Caption: message that I was getting across and

00:41:40.919 --> 00:41:45.959
Caption: when it came to her Communications with

00:41:43.379 --> 00:41:47.699
Caption: me I would often especially if it was

00:41:45.959 --> 00:41:51.000
Caption: something I would say email or would not

00:41:47.699 --> 00:41:52.618
Caption: do that strategy of instead of doing my

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.780
Caption: initial reaction which was often take

00:41:52.618 --> 00:41:56.819
Caption: quite taken aback because

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:59.040
Caption: um because it was often quite forceful

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.839
Caption: what she was saying I would just pause

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.459
Caption: and think about it for a second and try

00:42:00.839 --> 00:42:04.320
Caption: to think about the message that she

00:42:02.459 --> 00:42:05.879
Caption: probably was actually trying to convey

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.339
Caption: really giving her the benefit of the

00:42:05.879 --> 00:42:10.559
Caption: doubt that she probably wasn&#39;t trying to

00:42:08.339 --> 00:42:12.540
Caption: be mean or aggressive she was just

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:15.000
Caption: trying to be direct in her message and

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:16.439
Caption: get the information across so it&#39;s part

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.439
Caption: of putting yourself in the other

00:42:16.439 --> 00:42:21.540
Caption: person&#39;s shoes and taking a step back

00:42:19.439 --> 00:42:23.760
Caption: and then also trying to even replicate

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.859
Caption: their ways of communicating or their

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:28.079
Caption: actions when you&#39;re working with them so

00:42:25.858 --> 00:42:30.419
Caption: that they&#39;re more receptive to the

00:42:28.079 --> 00:42:32.940
Caption: things that you&#39;re describing and also

00:42:30.419 --> 00:42:35.280
Caption: she took the test as well so she was

00:42:32.939 --> 00:42:37.679
Caption: also more than aware of my personality

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:40.979
Caption: and my traits which helped the way she

00:42:37.679 --> 00:42:43.020
Caption: was working with me it made it so that

00:42:40.979 --> 00:42:45.118
Caption: she was Less Direct because she realized

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:49.020
Caption: that it wasn&#39;t really the the way that I

00:42:45.118 --> 00:42:52.500
Caption: like to communicate or work myself

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:55.579
Caption: three minutes I can probably do one more

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:55.579
Caption: time yeah

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.239

Caption: um as a super self-aware perfect leader

00:43:03.239 --> 00:43:06.959
Caption: um how do I help

00:43:05.399 --> 00:43:08.939
Caption: um other leaders who are trying to get

00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:10.739
Caption: me to follow but they&#39;re not

00:43:08.939 --> 00:43:14.159
Caption: particularly self-aware is there any way

00:43:10.739 --> 00:43:16.919
Caption: to inspire up when you can&#39;t be like hey

00:43:14.159 --> 00:43:18.059
Caption: do a personality test

00:43:16.919 --> 00:43:20.699
Caption: yeah

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:22.680

Caption: powerful tool um you know a lot of

00:43:22.679 --> 00:43:27.118
Caption: people yeah they might just not be aware

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:29.040
Caption: of what they&#39;re doing that you know they

00:43:27.118 --> 00:43:31.078
Caption: might not be aware that what they&#39;re

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.699
Caption: saying is you know putting people in a

00:43:31.079 --> 00:43:35.160
Caption: bad mood or that it&#39;s you know really

00:43:32.699 --> 00:43:38.760
Caption: not helping the team so just giving that

00:43:35.159 --> 00:43:42.780
Caption: feedback to them and having it be like

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:45.839
Caption: an open conversation of you know saying

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:48.959
Caption: um in in this situation this is you know

00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:50.640
Caption: the the outcomes of what happened how do

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:53.040
Caption: you think about that and giving them the

00:43:50.639 --> 00:43:55.078
Caption: opportunity to reflect themselves so

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.719
Caption: saying you know how do you think the

00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:59.819
Caption: team reacted in that situation and

00:43:57.719 --> 00:44:01.560
Caption: letting them you know have the space

00:43:59.819 --> 00:44:03.660
Caption: through your questions like my colleague

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.520
Caption: who is always saying why why do you want

00:44:03.659 --> 00:44:07.979
Caption: to do that um getting them almost

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:10.099
Caption: forcing them to reflect as well

00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:10.098
Caption: yeah

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.579
