  "description": "How does machine learning actually work? Is it something set aside from us mere mortals, only for the maths nerds with super-computers?\\n\\nUsing basic concepts we will go through how common machine learning algorithms work from first principles.\\n\\nIf someone were mad enough, they could even apply these basic concepts to build an Artificial Intelligence out of, say, a Microsoft PowerPoint...\\n\\nBut no one in their right mind would be crazy enough to do that.\\n\\nRight?\\n\\nBased on the Matchbox Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine (MENACE) built by Donald Michie in 1961, this talk strips the complexity and mystery from the black box that is machine learning: Proving that even a PowerPoint (mixed with a few lonely nights and almost 2,000 slides) can be taught the best opening moves of Tic Tac Toe.\\n\\nFinally, a truly no-code solution for machine learning enthusiasts.\\n\\nNo prior knowledge of Machine Learning, AI, or data science is needed.\\n\\nNo experience necessary\\n45 mins\\nAI \\u0026 ML\\nI am a data analytics advocate with an emphasis on generating people first insights.\\n\\nI come from a unique background with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Mathematics and Psychological Science, and a Master of Applied Artificial Intelligence on the way. I look for unique problem-solving opportunities and thrive in complex environments.\\n\\nI am passionate about all things data but have a keen interest in the development of machine learning in combination with traditional BI analytics. My role as a consultant keeps me close to the ground, giving me an insight into the technologies being used across many different domains.\\n\\nOutside of my role as a consultant, I help others get into the data field by teaching the Data Analytics Bootcamp at the University of Western Australia.\\n\\nData is a rapidly growing domain. It is my vision to spread awareness of the power that comes with taking control of data."
