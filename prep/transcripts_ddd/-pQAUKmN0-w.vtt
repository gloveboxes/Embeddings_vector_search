WEBVTT

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:07.519
Caption: all right uh so yeah today i&#39;m talking

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.039
Caption: about feature toggles so let&#39;s toggle

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.519
Caption: some features

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:13.440
Caption: um before we start this is a picture of

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.798
Caption: my face with a circle in it

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.639
Caption: and my name

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:18.879
Caption: if you wanted to tweet anything at me

00:00:16.639 --> 00:00:20.639
Caption: that&#39;s um that&#39;s my twitter handle and

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:22.159
Caption: there&#39;s a website there with some more

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:24.719
Caption: stuff about me if you wanted to have a

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:26.559
Caption: look um this talk will be put up there

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:28.079
Caption: um once they&#39;re made available on

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:30.399
Caption: youtube

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.639
Caption: another thing before we start uh thank

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.000
Caption: you to our amazing sponsors um

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:36.479
Caption: we keep saying that

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.919
Caption: uh sorry that uh ddd doesn&#39;t happen um

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:39.360
Caption: without the sponsors but i think it&#39;s

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:41.599
Caption: just as much everyone who&#39;s bought a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.840
Caption: ticket and is sitting here as well um

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:47.038
Caption: doesn&#39;t happen without the audience and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.639
Caption: buying for tickets so thank you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.520
Caption: all right so i want to start by going

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:53.439
Caption: back to the title image i put on my uh

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.238
Caption: on my slide here does anyone know where

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:56.238
Caption: this image is from

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:02.159
Caption: yeah it uh it&#39;s from uh a movie called

00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:04.238
Caption: the martian which was released in 2018.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.919
Caption: uh it&#39;s an image of the nasa mission

00:01:04.238 --> 00:01:07.040
Caption: control center in the context of that

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:09.599
Caption: movie

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.520
Caption: um so it&#39;s set slightly in the future

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:12.798
Caption: it&#39;s more futuristic than what you might

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:14.319
Caption: be used to

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.000
Caption: um and i think it&#39;s definitely a bit of

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.519
Caption: a cliche to use an image like this in my

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.439
Caption: title slide like you might be getting a

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:20.798
Caption: feeling of deja vu like you&#39;ve seen this

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.040
Caption: talk before

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.439
Caption: and i understand right like nasa&#39;s cool

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.680
Caption: and space is really cool and sometimes

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.439
Caption: launching a new piece of software to the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.599
Caption: world feels a bit like this

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.319
Caption: but i&#39;m using this image for my title

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.919
Caption: slide with some irony because i think

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.478
Caption: this actually represents the opposite of

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:42.078
Caption: what we want to do in the real world is

00:01:40.478 --> 00:01:43.758
Caption: why

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.279
Caption: nasa typically has to work really hard

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.959
Caption: to prevent anything going wrong for

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:49.360
Caption: obvious reasons

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.959
Caption: that&#39;s why they have mission control

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.279
Caption: launching people into space is very

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.199
Caption: expensive and very dangerous

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:57.118
Caption: more so when something goes wrong we

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:58.718
Caption: want to avoid that

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.079
Caption: so i&#39;m not going to spoil it but for

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.880
Caption: those who might not have seen this movie

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.560
Caption: the mission does go very wrong basically

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:07.680
Caption: there&#39;s an incident and one of the

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:10.639
Caption: astronauts his name is mark watney

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.720
Caption: is left on mars by himself

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:15.839
Caption: probably goes without saying that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.520
Caption: this kind of incident was unexpected so

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:20.639
Caption: no amount of planning or pre-preparation

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.440
Caption: could have prepared them for this

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:24.720
Caption: scenario

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.800
Caption: and i think the real problem with this

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.040
Caption: image or the real problem with

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.120
Caption: the people in mission control was not a

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:33.199
Caption: single person in this room

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:35.679
Caption: has any agency to to help him fix this

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:37.679
Caption: problem mark&#39;s out there on his own

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:39.039
Caption: they can&#39;t provide any direct support to

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.319
Caption: mark

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.679
Caption: they actually couldn&#39;t communicate with

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.759
Caption: him either

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:45.359
Caption: mostly all they can really do is just

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:48.238
Caption: sit in front of those screens and watch

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.238
Caption: as everything happens

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.800
Caption: i think we can draw some comparisons to

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.919
Caption: this situation in history

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.559
Caption: uh in the history of software

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:58.958
Caption: development our software development

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.800
Caption: so microsoft windows is historically

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.679
Caption: very very expensive piece of software to

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.639
Caption: build

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:06.079
Caption: um much like a rocket launch right

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.759
Caption: microsoft has to spend an enormous

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.158
Caption: amount of money to make sure that there

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:11.839
Caption: are a few as few bugs as possible

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:14.000
Caption: um they have to be absolutely certain

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:15.598
Caption: that everything works before they burn

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.479
Caption: their copy of that software onto that

00:03:15.598 --> 00:03:20.479
Caption: disk because once it&#39;s on that disk

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.238
Caption: and then once they put that disk inside

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:24.639
Caption: the box and then they put that box

00:03:22.238 --> 00:03:26.080
Caption: inside a bigger box in a truck

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.158
Caption: there&#39;s basically nothing they can do

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.958
Caption: after that point

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:33.518
Caption: uh fixing something after launch for for

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:36.958
Caption: microsoft for windows engineers is an

00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:36.958
Caption: exercise that&#39;s very very expensive

00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:40.798
Caption: there are a lot of changes and new

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:43.039
Caption: releases in this particular

00:03:40.798 --> 00:03:45.039
Caption: version of windows so this delayed the

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.798
Caption: launch and then thusly increased the

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:48.238
Caption: risk

00:03:46.798 --> 00:03:49.679
Caption: and this meant that more testing was

00:03:48.238 --> 00:03:52.158
Caption: going to be required

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:53.518
Caption: so microsoft always tests

00:03:52.158 --> 00:03:55.039
Caption: windows with a lot of different

00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:57.759
Caption: configurations of hardware and stuff

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:58.839
Caption: like that but vista failed because of

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.199
Caption: unforeseen

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:02.399
Caption: circumstances that happened after launch

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.080
Caption: so essentially they were testing the

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:05.839
Caption: wrong things

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.080
Caption: essentially what happened with vista

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:09.279
Caption: particularly was they were at odds at

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.639
Caption: the time with

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:12.399
Caption: their hardware

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.559
Caption: developers

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:16.720
Caption: and then those hardware builders

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:18.880
Caption: as maybe a better word they went against

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.079
Caption: the advice of microsoft and shipped

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.639
Caption: configurations that weren&#39;t really

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.680
Caption: compatible with this software

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.199
Caption: so this was an unexpected event

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:29.039
Caption: it&#39;s probably a little bit unfair to

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.479
Caption: pick on vista because a lot of the same

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.919
Caption: problems were true of any piece of

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.600
Caption: software at the time and any windows

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.279
Caption: release or any like any large releases

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.440
Caption: of software at the time it was pretty

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:39.199
Caption: common

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.880
Caption: so going back to the martian for a

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.040
Caption: little bit

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.279
Caption: this is an image from a scene without

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.360
Caption: spoiling anything again hopefully

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:48.720
Caption: uh it&#39;s an image from a scene where mark

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:51.039
Caption: was able to make first contact with

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.399
Caption: mission control back on earth

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.320
Caption: um so he used a pretty clever hack

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:58.479
Caption: to to get this to work it was it was

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.440
Caption: quite an interesting part of the movie

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.759
Caption: um but

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.239
Caption: nonetheless communication was still

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.559
Caption: pretty slow and difficult and that&#39;s a

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:09.199
Caption: problem so if if mark was a windows

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:11.279
Caption: vista user we&#39;d probably describe him as

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.399
Caption: a power user

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:14.479
Caption: and the fact that he was able to

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:17.519
Caption: communicate with the crew on earth at

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.039
Caption: all was actually largely incidental

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:20.079
Caption: this is probably

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.239
Caption: the same could really be said for

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:23.519
Caption: windows vista as well

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:25.199
Caption: customers would

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:27.440
Caption: typically buy a new machine that a

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.800
Caption: typical customer not a power user would

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.880
Caption: buy a machine

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:32.799
Caption: um and they&#39;d quickly find all of these

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.239
Caption: bugs that were common amongst uh lots of

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:36.079
Caption: people who bought this

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:37.599
Caption: um and it was very difficult for them to

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:39.839
Caption: communicate with the engineers that

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.279
Caption: built microsoft microsoft windows as

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.399
Caption: well as um

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.600
Caption: they couldn&#39;t really get the support

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:45.519
Caption: they needed

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.199
Caption: there&#39;s if they did get in touch with

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:48.559
Caption: support there was often very little that

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.000
Caption: those microsoft engineers could do

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:51.839
Caption: because they had software that was burnt

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.839
Caption: onto a disk so it was very difficult to

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.639
Caption: change at that point

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:55.919
Caption: and

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.039
Caption: ask the question

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.279
Caption: is this something that we really want

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.479
Caption: for our customers whether it be our

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.559
Caption: customer

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.399
Caption: alone by himself on mars or a customer

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:06.639
Caption: who&#39;s bought a machine with windows

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:08.160
Caption: vista on it i don&#39;t think so i think

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.839
Caption: we&#39;ve learned enough about software

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.559
Caption: development over the years vista was a

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:14.559
Caption: long time ago that we can do better

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:16.880
Caption: and that&#39;s exactly what feature toggles

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:16.880
Caption: are for

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.000
Caption: so quick outline

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:22.160
Caption: i&#39;m going to go through a really quick a

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.440
Caption: bridge history of feature toggles

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.479
Caption: that&#39;s important

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.119
Caption: and then i&#39;m going to talk about what

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.880
Caption: exactly a feature toggle is and then i&#39;m

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:30.959
Caption: going to finish on some techniques and

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.800
Caption: strategy

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:35.679
Caption: so the story of feature toggle starts

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:38.239
Caption: with this book um it was written by some

00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:40.160
Caption: microsoft engineers who built microsoft

00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:41.679
Caption: word early versions of word and excel

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.279
Caption: and one version of windows i can&#39;t

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:45.199
Caption: remember which one it was released in

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:48.319
Caption: about 1995

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.239
Caption: might be windows 95 in that case um so

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.679
Caption: it&#39;s kind of an old book and i haven&#39;t

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:53.359
Caption: actually read it i&#39;m not i&#39;m not going

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:54.959
Caption: to admit that i&#39;ve read this and i

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:56.079
Caption: probably won&#39;t recommend reading it

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:58.319
Caption: either i don&#39;t think a lot of the

00:06:56.079 --> 00:07:00.478
Caption: information in here is relevant anymore

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.799
Caption: but it does have one interesting

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:04.880
Caption: section in the book uh it goes through

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:06.239
Caption: the details of how microsoft was

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.759
Caption: developing software at that time what

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:10.479
Caption: their process was

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:12.239
Caption: um essentially it was a 10-step process

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.160
Caption: and it would probably look pretty

00:07:12.239 --> 00:07:16.959
Caption: familiar to most people now

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.800
Caption: even though this was set in 1995

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:20.638
Caption: this process has a name

00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:22.239
Caption: it&#39;s not it&#39;s not exactly like this now

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:24.160
Caption: in modern software development but this

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:27.759
Caption: process is something that we use today

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.759
Caption: and it&#39;s called trunk based development

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.160
Caption: so trunk based development actually as

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.919
Caption: it turns out was pretty much

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.160
Caption: it was getting pushed by um a lot of

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:38.800
Caption: people around that time um

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.039
Caption: starting in around 1985 to 2005. so you

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:43.119
Caption: had this book that came out it was 1995

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:44.720
Caption: but around the same time thought works

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:47.039
Caption: were really pushing this as well they

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.360
Caption: had a piece of um it was a build server

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:50.720
Caption: called cruise control

00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:53.679
Caption: and that was really kind of pushing the

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.759
Caption: idea of continuous integration

00:07:53.679 --> 00:07:58.799
Caption: and then something happened

00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:00.559
Caption: we had git and github not to say that

00:07:58.799 --> 00:08:02.638
Caption: either of these software are

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:06.239
Caption: particularly bad like um who uses git i

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:06.240
Caption: think everyone does right yeah

00:08:06.559 --> 00:08:10.399
Caption: it introduced the idea of distributed

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:12.399
Caption: version control first of all

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:13.839
Caption: but also lightweight branching so

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:15.839
Caption: branching before

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:17.839
Caption: git came along was this exercise that

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:19.279
Caption: was quite heavy um

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:21.759
Caption: it wasn&#39;t slow or anything like that or

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:24.399
Caption: difficult but uh you did need to take an

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:27.119
Caption: entire copy of all the code and create a

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:29.039
Caption: branch with that um whereas was able to

00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:31.039
Caption: do that without taking an entire copy of

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:33.359
Caption: all your code all at once so it took up

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:35.119
Caption: disk space

00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:36.640
Caption: and then github came along shortly after

00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:38.398
Caption: and introduced the idea of pull requests

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.718
Caption: so if you think about those steps in

00:08:38.398 --> 00:08:41.518
Caption: that process there was a step where if

00:08:40.718 --> 00:08:43.200
Caption: we&#39;ve

00:08:41.518 --> 00:08:44.799
Caption: successfully built our software and all

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.559
Caption: the tests passed and we&#39;ve run our smoke

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:49.039
Caption: tests and stuff like that we can just

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:50.559
Caption: merge that software straight back into

00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:52.159
Caption: whatever we&#39;re working on microsoft word

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:54.880
Caption: for example so our feature goes straight

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:56.799
Caption: in but pull requests add another layer

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.320
Caption: of friction there in order to get your

00:08:56.799 --> 00:09:01.440
Caption: software into the product um by creating

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.440
Caption: a step where you have to have a review

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.799
Caption: first sometimes

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.720
Caption: i don&#39;t know if anyone&#39;s experienced

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:08.559
Caption: this but have a pull request open for

00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:12.000
Caption: several days takes a long time that&#39;s

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:12.000
Caption: just adding friction to the process

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:16.799
Caption: so people got fed up with this

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.760
Caption: and then some developments start to come

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:21.679
Caption: out after that so around the end of 2010

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.119
Caption: a couple of books came out so we have

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:25.039
Caption: the book by

00:09:23.119 --> 00:09:27.119
Caption: dave farley and jess humble that&#39;s

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:29.119
Caption: continuous delivery

00:09:27.119 --> 00:09:31.679
Caption: really pushing the idea of

00:09:29.119 --> 00:09:33.599
Caption: high degrees of automation lots of

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:35.599
Caption: avoiding manual testing

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:38.319
Caption: and trunk-based development is part of

00:09:35.599 --> 00:09:39.679
Caption: that book as well as well as accelerate

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.958
Caption: you might have seen some other people in

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:42.239
Caption: this conference talking about that book

00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.000
Caption: as well

00:09:42.239 --> 00:09:45.919
Caption: and these also coincide with the devops

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Caption: movement and various other things as

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:51.639
Caption: well and this is where our story of

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.640
Caption: feature toggle starts

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.000
Caption: so i want to talk about something

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.799
Caption: that is in the continuous delivery book

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.080
Caption: by dave farley it&#39;s this idea of cones

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:02.159
Caption: of change

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.519
Caption: so you can imagine two developers are

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:05.518
Caption: working on a new feature so they&#39;re

00:10:03.518 --> 00:10:06.799
Caption: working inside the same repository for

00:10:05.518 --> 00:10:08.639
Caption: example

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:12.320
Caption: and we can imagine working on that

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.160
Caption: feature as the culmination of a numerous

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.000
Caption: changes so we&#39;ll open up a file we&#39;ll

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:18.879
Caption: make a little change there we&#39;ll open up

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.559
Caption: another file maybe add new files delete

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.320
Caption: files and stuff like that

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:23.838
Caption: and that accumulation of change is is

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.200
Caption: known as a cone of change and the

00:10:23.838 --> 00:10:28.880
Caption: problem with

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:30.880
Caption: uh large amounts of change is or the

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.039
Caption: culmination of lots of change is that

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.760
Caption: eventually that cone gets wide enough

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:38.078
Caption: that it might clash with other cones

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.000
Caption: we can see those collisions there

00:10:38.078 --> 00:10:42.000
Caption: those collisions are in the form of

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.359
Caption: merge conflicts but also it can be code

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.880
Caption: that

00:10:43.359 --> 00:10:46.799
Caption: is going completely in two different

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.919
Caption: directions it&#39;s really not able to be

00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:52.159
Caption: merged it gets difficult

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:54.000
Caption: so we can see that yeah the wider our

00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:55.359
Caption: kind of change the more likely we are to

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.039
Caption: have

00:10:55.359 --> 00:11:01.479
Caption: collisions there that are hard to hard

00:10:57.039 --> 00:11:01.479
Caption: to work with so how do we fix that

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:06.559
Caption: picks up with the idea of continuous

00:11:03.518 --> 00:11:09.039
Caption: integration so instead of thinking about

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:10.559
Caption: features what we can do instead is start

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:12.880
Caption: to think about something that&#39;s smaller

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:14.479
Caption: than a feature just a small change some

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.838
Caption: some part of a feature but not the whole

00:11:14.479 --> 00:11:17.919
Caption: thing because those features could be

00:11:15.838 --> 00:11:20.479
Caption: too big and could be creating too many

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:21.518
Caption: of those large cones

00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:23.199
Caption: so

00:11:21.518 --> 00:11:24.320
Caption: if we&#39;re going to go and change this up

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.919
Caption: so that we&#39;re using continuous

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.359
Caption: integration instead it will look

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:28.398
Caption: something like this

00:11:27.359 --> 00:11:29.760
Caption: instead of

00:11:28.398 --> 00:11:31.359
Caption: keeping that feature to ourselves and

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.119
Caption: building and building a building upon it

00:11:31.359 --> 00:11:34.880
Caption: let&#39;s commit

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:38.000
Caption: to the trunk this is trunk based

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.919
Caption: development um small changes

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.078
Caption: and and

00:11:39.919 --> 00:11:43.359
Caption: yeah then what we can see here is we&#39;re

00:11:42.078 --> 00:11:46.398
Caption: not seeing those kinds of changes we&#39;re

00:11:43.359 --> 00:11:49.838
Caption: not seeing any sort of collisions there

00:11:46.398 --> 00:11:49.838
Caption: so that&#39;s continuous integration

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:54.398
Caption: if we look at trunk based development

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:56.398
Caption: versus something more traditional like

00:11:54.398 --> 00:11:57.838
Caption: feature branches now we go from having

00:11:56.398 --> 00:12:00.320
Caption: our branches be something that&#39;s

00:11:57.838 --> 00:12:01.919
Caption: long-lived um feature branches you might

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.398
Caption: find you have a long-lived branch that&#39;s

00:12:01.919 --> 00:12:05.679
Caption: uh per environment for example so that&#39;s

00:12:04.398 --> 00:12:06.638
Caption: almost like the longest loop branch you

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:08.479
Caption: can have you&#39;re not going to have an

00:12:06.638 --> 00:12:10.559
Caption: environment like dev

00:12:08.479 --> 00:12:13.278
Caption: come and go that&#39;s around forever

00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:15.200
Caption: versus something like a trunk based

00:12:13.278 --> 00:12:19.039
Caption: approach where branches are all geared

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.040
Caption: to be short-lived as short as possible

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:24.239
Caption: what typically happens with feature

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.480
Caption: branches is the batch size for a release

00:12:24.239 --> 00:12:28.078
Caption: as in a new version that&#39;s usable for

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:30.320
Caption: your customers

00:12:28.078 --> 00:12:32.320
Caption: is a number of features

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.320
Caption: just because you&#39;ll have to align a

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.760
Caption: whole bunch of things and it tends to

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.200
Caption: align that you can release a bunch of

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.679
Caption: features all at once

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.440
Caption: whereas releasing trunk based software

00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:42.880
Caption: we might be releasing

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.919
Caption: something less than a feature that batch

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.000
Caption: size is going to be smaller than that

00:12:45.919 --> 00:12:49.359
Caption: as well as that because

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.518
Caption: we&#39;re not releasing huge amounts of

00:12:49.359 --> 00:12:55.278
Caption: change all at once our change risk goes

00:12:51.518 --> 00:12:55.278
Caption: from being high to low instead

00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:59.518
Caption: so to summarize trunk based development

00:12:57.278 --> 00:13:02.479
Caption: it&#39;s a branching model for code cable a

00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:04.159
Caption: collaboration on a single branch

00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:05.278
Caption: and that&#39;s an enabler of continuous

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:08.638
Caption: integration

00:13:05.278 --> 00:13:10.398
Caption: hopefully that that makes sense

00:13:08.638 --> 00:13:11.679
Caption: cool so what exactly is a feature toggle

00:13:10.398 --> 00:13:13.278
Caption: what is where do feature toggles come

00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:15.518
Caption: into this

00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:16.880
Caption: uh let&#39;s take a definition

00:13:15.518 --> 00:13:18.479
Caption: so a feature toggle is a software

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.720
Caption: engineering technique for enabling

00:13:18.479 --> 00:13:22.719
Caption: feature life cycle management with or

00:13:20.719 --> 00:13:25.518
Caption: without deploying new code

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:27.838
Caption: so who&#39;s used feature toggles before

00:13:25.518 --> 00:13:30.320
Caption: that&#39;s quite a few people too

00:13:27.838 --> 00:13:32.320
Caption: um just the with or without part without

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.039
Caption: with or without deploying your code

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.119
Caption: does that does that sound a bit odd

00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:39.518
Caption: it did to me i had maybe a picture of

00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:40.559
Caption: how feature toggles work um and the idea

00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:42.239
Caption: to me was

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:43.838
Caption: we can deploy a piece of software and we

00:13:42.239 --> 00:13:45.278
Caption: can fiddle with it we can change things

00:13:43.838 --> 00:13:46.559
Caption: turn them off and on without having to

00:13:45.278 --> 00:13:48.719
Caption: deploy new code

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:49.919
Caption: but actually it turns out it&#39;s something

00:13:48.719 --> 00:13:52.398
Caption: larger than that

00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:54.479
Caption: so let&#39;s go into it

00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:55.760
Caption: here&#39;s some code that is a feature

00:13:54.479 --> 00:13:57.679
Caption: toggle

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.398
Caption: feature toggle code um let&#39;s go through

00:13:57.679 --> 00:14:00.159
Caption: it

00:13:58.398 --> 00:14:02.638
Caption: we have this function here this is

00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:04.398
Caption: typescript by the way we have this

00:14:02.638 --> 00:14:05.838
Caption: feature here we can ask for a feature by

00:14:04.398 --> 00:14:08.159
Caption: name and this function will tell us

00:14:05.838 --> 00:14:09.760
Caption: whether that feature is enabled not

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:11.198
Caption: we&#39;ll wrap it in a functional interface

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.639
Caption: called feature toggle

00:14:11.198 --> 00:14:13.679
Caption: and then we can use that functional

00:14:12.638 --> 00:14:14.559
Caption: interface

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:16.958
Caption: to

00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:20.239
Caption: whether a feature is disabled or not run

00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:22.638
Caption: uh one branch of code or another

00:14:20.239 --> 00:14:24.479
Caption: so who can tell me

00:14:22.638 --> 00:14:26.880
Caption: uh we don&#39;t have to answer this

00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:28.559
Caption: very quite difficult but who can tell me

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.638
Caption: what happens when this code runs or who

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:32.398
Caption: knows

00:14:30.638 --> 00:14:33.759
Caption: problem is we don&#39;t know

00:14:32.398 --> 00:14:35.599
Caption: what we actually don&#39;t have here is an

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.880
Caption: implementation all we have is interfaces

00:14:35.599 --> 00:14:38.559
Caption: and stuff like that so i don&#39;t know

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.398
Caption: which log message i&#39;m going to get i

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:42.958
Caption: don&#39;t have that information

00:14:40.398 --> 00:14:45.679
Caption: so what that interface alone isn&#39;t

00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:47.440
Caption: telling me is what&#39;s the persistence of

00:14:45.679 --> 00:14:48.880
Caption: this feature toggle like where does the

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.919
Caption: value live it could live in some

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:54.479
Caption: database or it could live in sorry a

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:56.838
Caption: relational database nosql database it

00:14:54.479 --> 00:14:59.359
Caption: could leave in some sort of flat file

00:14:56.838 --> 00:15:01.440
Caption: um we live in a json file or some format

00:14:59.359 --> 00:15:02.799
Caption: that i&#39;ve never seen before

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.078
Caption: there&#39;s third-party services where we

00:15:02.799 --> 00:15:05.679
Caption: can get our feature talkers from so

00:15:04.078 --> 00:15:08.398
Caption: launch darkly is

00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:10.320
Caption: the most common one i think

00:15:08.398 --> 00:15:12.159
Caption: as well as it could just be something we

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.359
Caption: calculate on the fly or it could just be

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:15.838
Caption: something that lives in the code

00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:15.838
Caption: somewhere

00:15:16.479 --> 00:15:19.838
Caption: it also doesn&#39;t tell me when this

00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:21.919
Caption: feature toggle is evaluated

00:15:19.838 --> 00:15:23.198
Caption: so this could be evaluated per request

00:15:21.919 --> 00:15:25.440
Caption: every time we request it it could

00:15:23.198 --> 00:15:27.119
Caption: potentially be different or maybe we

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.559
Caption: resolve all the values of our feature

00:15:27.119 --> 00:15:30.320
Caption: toggles at startup

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:32.320
Caption: um so that they once we start up the

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.000
Caption: application they&#39;re always the same

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.440
Caption: maybe it&#39;s something that we resolve at

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.880
Caption: build time so we can build different

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.239
Caption: versions with different feature toggles

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.359
Caption: but they once they&#39;re built they stay

00:15:38.239 --> 00:15:40.880
Caption: the same

00:15:39.359 --> 00:15:42.479
Caption: or perhaps it&#39;s something that&#39;s just

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.838
Caption: completely static it&#39;s just always the

00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:45.198
Caption: same

00:15:43.838 --> 00:15:47.679
Caption: regardless of when you build it or when

00:15:45.198 --> 00:15:47.679
Caption: you run it

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.838
Caption: it also doesn&#39;t describe the longevity

00:15:50.239 --> 00:15:54.159
Caption: of the feature toggle like how long is

00:15:51.838 --> 00:15:55.679
Caption: this designed to last for how long how

00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:57.679
Caption: long is this meant to be a feature

00:15:55.679 --> 00:16:00.398
Caption: toggle for it could be somewhere between

00:15:57.679 --> 00:16:02.078
Caption: hours or years and i think years really

00:16:00.398 --> 00:16:04.958
Caption: means it definitely

00:16:02.078 --> 00:16:04.958
Caption: a very long time

00:16:05.359 --> 00:16:08.719
Caption: it also doesn&#39;t really describe some

00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.599
Caption: aspects of the behavior

00:16:08.719 --> 00:16:11.198
Caption: so

00:16:09.599 --> 00:16:13.679
Caption: we don&#39;t know anything about the input

00:16:11.198 --> 00:16:16.078
Caption: validation here what if that feature is

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:17.119
Caption: one that i&#39;m not familiar with me is the

00:16:16.078 --> 00:16:18.479
Caption: code

00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:21.359
Caption: what should happen there should there be

00:16:18.479 --> 00:16:23.119
Caption: some sort of safe fallback

00:16:21.359 --> 00:16:24.958
Caption: should the default value be false or

00:16:23.119 --> 00:16:26.000
Caption: true should it throw an exception

00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.518
Caption: because i don&#39;t really know what the

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.198
Caption: default value is

00:16:27.518 --> 00:16:30.320
Caption: and it doesn&#39;t really give me any idea

00:16:29.198 --> 00:16:32.799
Caption: whether the

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.880
Caption: output of this is consistent at all

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:37.440
Caption: so not much there that an interface can

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.278
Caption: tell us

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.039
Caption: i&#39;ve got a hypothesis

00:16:39.278 --> 00:16:43.198
Caption: let&#39;s implement our feature toggle this

00:16:41.039 --> 00:16:45.919
Caption: way so this is this is a feature toggle

00:16:43.198 --> 00:16:47.919
Caption: service called always off and what we do

00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:49.599
Caption: is we ignore the input we don&#39;t care

00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:52.719
Caption: what feature toggle it is we&#39;ll just

00:16:49.599 --> 00:16:52.719
Caption: always return false

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.198
Caption: we can implement the feature toggle down

00:16:54.719 --> 00:16:59.518
Caption: here in the closure

00:16:57.198 --> 00:17:01.359
Caption: so is this a feature toggle

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:02.880
Caption: i think it is it looks like it looks

00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:04.719
Caption: like one to me right it implements the

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.918
Caption: feature toggle interface

00:17:04.719 --> 00:17:07.359
Caption: it returns

00:17:05.918 --> 00:17:10.000
Caption: the correct value something that i&#39;m

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:11.520
Caption: kind of expecting it&#39;s a boolean

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.438
Caption: but i&#39;m looking at this and i&#39;m going

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.599
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of superfluous code here i

00:17:13.438 --> 00:17:17.198
Caption: don&#39;t really need half of this right

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:19.359
Caption: i&#39;m always getting the same value from

00:17:17.198 --> 00:17:20.958
Caption: this feature toggle it&#39;s always false so

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.719
Caption: why don&#39;t i just do a bit of refactoring

00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.719
Caption: right

00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:26.159
Caption: what if i just remove

00:17:24.719 --> 00:17:27.678
Caption: some of that feature toggle stuff and i

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.960
Caption: just drop that false in there so it&#39;s

00:17:27.678 --> 00:17:30.159
Caption: always because it&#39;s always going to be

00:17:28.959 --> 00:17:32.798
Caption: false

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.479
Caption: is this a feature toggle well it doesn&#39;t

00:17:32.798 --> 00:17:35.678
Caption: say it&#39;s a feature toggle anymore

00:17:34.479 --> 00:17:37.520
Caption: there&#39;s no interface i&#39;m not

00:17:35.678 --> 00:17:38.880
Caption: implementing a feature toggle interface

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.400
Caption: but i think this still is a feature

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.239
Caption: toggle

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.239
Caption: let&#39;s go a step further

00:17:42.239 --> 00:17:46.079
Caption: if my compiler&#39;s having a look at this

00:17:44.239 --> 00:17:47.439
Caption: so i&#39;m using typescript although this

00:17:46.079 --> 00:17:49.599
Caption: code kind of looks like it&#39;s just

00:17:47.439 --> 00:17:50.959
Caption: javascript by now

00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:52.400
Caption: if i&#39;m using typescript typestrip&#39;s

00:17:50.959 --> 00:17:54.399
Caption: going to have a look at that and start

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.280
Caption: to make efficiencies here and there and

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.880
Caption: it doesn&#39;t really matter if it&#39;s

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.160
Caption: typescript or other compilers that

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.160
Caption: mostly do this

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.160
Caption: it&#39;ll look at that if false statement

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.679
Caption: and go what&#39;s the point in that there&#39;s

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.599
Caption: it&#39;s i don&#39;t like i&#39;m never going to

00:18:03.678 --> 00:18:07.359
Caption: execute that code on line five it&#39;s i

00:18:05.599 --> 00:18:09.359
Caption: might as well get rid of it so let&#39;s say

00:18:07.359 --> 00:18:10.640
Caption: the compiler has a go in it um just

00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:12.798
Caption: removes that

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.239
Caption: is that a feature toggle

00:18:12.798 --> 00:18:17.199
Caption: not looking much like a feature toggle

00:18:14.239 --> 00:18:19.280
Caption: anymore but i still believe that that is

00:18:17.199 --> 00:18:20.959
Caption: that might look a bit strange but i did

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.400
Caption: title my talk everything&#39;s a feature

00:18:20.959 --> 00:18:23.520
Caption: toggle so i had to work something like

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.880
Caption: that in there

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.160
Caption: um yeah it doesn&#39;t look like a feature

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.400
Caption: talk was just a bit of code but yeah

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.400
Caption: that is

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.520
Caption: i&#39;m going to give this feature toggle a

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.359
Caption: name i don&#39;t think there&#39;s commonly used

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.760
Caption: names for a lot of this stuff so

00:18:35.359 --> 00:18:39.359
Caption: these names are just made up by me but

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.919
Caption: i&#39;m going to call this a static toggle

00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:43.918
Caption: and a static toggle is categorized by

00:18:41.918 --> 00:18:44.880
Caption: being persisted in code so i don&#39;t have

00:18:43.918 --> 00:18:46.880
Caption: to ask

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.760
Caption: some database or some file for the value

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:52.400
Caption: of this one it&#39;s just in the code

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.400
Caption: i get static and very consistent

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.400
Caption: evaluation it&#39;s basically just always

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.160
Caption: false it&#39;s very very predictable and

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.799
Caption: that&#39;s nice

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.239
Caption: and this is a tool you can do

00:19:00.798 --> 00:19:04.319
Caption: you can use to do a thing called

00:19:02.239 --> 00:19:05.359
Caption: branching by abstraction

00:19:04.319 --> 00:19:08.558
Caption: so

00:19:05.359 --> 00:19:11.199
Caption: let&#39;s talk about what that means

00:19:08.558 --> 00:19:12.959
Caption: let&#39;s say we have um some old code that

00:19:11.199 --> 00:19:14.479
Caption: we want to replace we&#39;ve got a new

00:19:12.959 --> 00:19:16.319
Caption: version maybe a new version of an

00:19:14.479 --> 00:19:18.079
Caption: algorithm that we want um to put in

00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:19.918
Caption: there that&#39;s more efficient

00:19:18.079 --> 00:19:21.519
Caption: but what we want to do is that algorithm

00:19:19.918 --> 00:19:22.798
Caption: is going to take a little bit of back

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.440
Caption: and forth maybe it&#39;s going to be

00:19:22.798 --> 00:19:27.519
Caption: multiple commits to our repository it&#39;s

00:19:25.439 --> 00:19:29.119
Caption: going to take a little while to write

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.640
Caption: i want to i want guarantees that i can

00:19:29.119 --> 00:19:32.319
Caption: start writing that code make commits

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.919
Caption: maybe someone else can kind of um

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:35.439
Caption: collaborate with me but i want

00:19:33.918 --> 00:19:37.199
Caption: guarantees that that code that i&#39;ve got

00:19:35.439 --> 00:19:38.639
Caption: in that term in my repository is not

00:19:37.199 --> 00:19:40.239
Caption: going to run right

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.119
Caption: so what i could do

00:19:40.239 --> 00:19:43.038
Caption: is

00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:44.798
Caption: do a commit um i don&#39;t have to do a

00:19:43.038 --> 00:19:46.719
Caption: commit and push all of this up but like

00:19:44.798 --> 00:19:48.558
Caption: the first change i might look at making

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:50.798
Caption: is putting a feature toggle in front of

00:19:48.558 --> 00:19:53.279
Caption: it and this can be an always off feature

00:19:50.798 --> 00:19:54.079
Caption: toggle so i&#39;m always going to go down to

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.679
Caption: that

00:19:54.079 --> 00:19:57.439
Caption: old code path so it doesn&#39;t really

00:19:55.678 --> 00:19:59.678
Caption: matter what on what&#39;s on that new code

00:19:57.439 --> 00:20:01.119
Caption: path there at the top at the moment

00:19:59.678 --> 00:20:03.038
Caption: there&#39;s nothing i haven&#39;t put anything

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:04.959
Caption: in yet

00:20:03.038 --> 00:20:06.798
Caption: then what i might do is start working on

00:20:04.959 --> 00:20:08.479
Caption: that new algorithm and if i&#39;m just

00:20:06.798 --> 00:20:10.079
Caption: playing around locally i can switch that

00:20:08.479 --> 00:20:12.079
Caption: to an always-on toggle as long as i

00:20:10.079 --> 00:20:13.599
Caption: don&#39;t commit that anywhere

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:15.839
Caption: i can start working with that new

00:20:13.599 --> 00:20:17.918
Caption: algorithm test the performance do stuff

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:19.439
Caption: like that i can commit that

00:20:17.918 --> 00:20:20.880
Caption: and let one of my colleagues have a play

00:20:19.439 --> 00:20:22.479
Caption: around with it and see if they can make

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.319
Caption: it more efficient

00:20:22.479 --> 00:20:26.640
Caption: i get a guarantee that i know that

00:20:24.319 --> 00:20:28.399
Caption: code&#39;s not going to run

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.200
Caption: in production it&#39;s not going to make it

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.719
Caption: into

00:20:29.199 --> 00:20:32.000
Caption: into the hands of users which is quite

00:20:30.719 --> 00:20:33.359
Caption: nice

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.038
Caption: once i&#39;m ready

00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:37.359
Caption: i can flip that feature toggle from

00:20:35.038 --> 00:20:38.558
Caption: being always off to always on or i might

00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:40.158
Caption: have some other feature toggling

00:20:38.558 --> 00:20:41.520
Caption: strategy there

00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:42.720
Caption: i&#39;ll talk about more of those in a

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.400
Caption: minute but

00:20:42.719 --> 00:20:46.079
Caption: once i&#39;m ready basically i&#39;m going to

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.960
Caption: start executing code on that new code

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:49.279
Caption: path

00:20:46.959 --> 00:20:50.640
Caption: and then when i&#39;m happy with the final

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.919
Caption: solution here

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.678
Caption: it looks like it&#39;s running perfectly

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:55.119
Caption: fine the last step i can do is just to

00:20:53.678 --> 00:20:56.959
Caption: remove both the feature toggle and the

00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:59.038
Caption: old version of code it&#39;s quite a safe

00:20:56.959 --> 00:21:00.719
Caption: approach to incrementally adding new

00:20:59.038 --> 00:21:03.839
Caption: features and that&#39;s what branch by

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:03.839
Caption: abstraction is

00:21:04.479 --> 00:21:08.719
Caption: so this is a quote from martin feller&#39;s

00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:10.319
Caption: article about feature toggles um

00:21:08.719 --> 00:21:11.520
Caption: specifically in the context of what i&#39;ve

00:21:10.319 --> 00:21:12.959
Caption: just talked about

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.880
Caption: feature toggles are an interesting way

00:21:12.959 --> 00:21:16.640
Caption: to allow incomplete and untested code

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.959
Caption: paths to be shipped to production as

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.479
Caption: latent code i sometimes call it floating

00:21:18.959 --> 00:21:22.079
Caption: code

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:23.678
Caption: but the idea of that is that we get

00:21:22.079 --> 00:21:25.279
Caption: guarantees that it will never be turned

00:21:23.678 --> 00:21:27.599
Caption: on it&#39;ll ever be executed which is quite

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.599
Caption: nice

00:21:28.479 --> 00:21:31.439
Caption: let&#39;s uh go back to our static toggle

00:21:30.239 --> 00:21:32.880
Caption: for a minute

00:21:31.439 --> 00:21:34.798
Caption: um let&#39;s just work through an

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.719
Caption: implementation just so we get an idea of

00:21:34.798 --> 00:21:37.519
Caption: what that might actually look like

00:21:36.719 --> 00:21:39.918
Caption: so

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.760
Caption: what we have here is uh i&#39;m looking at

00:21:39.918 --> 00:21:44.959
Caption: implementing a new version of my payment

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.880
Caption: gateway um maybe we&#39;ve moved from xml

00:21:44.959 --> 00:21:48.959
Caption: and soap to something a bit nicer like

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.959
Caption: json

00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:52.640
Caption: the idea here is that

00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:54.079
Caption: the input and output basically the

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.000
Caption: interface to this plane and gateway&#39;s

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:58.880
Caption: the same that&#39;s how we can use branch by

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.520
Caption: abstraction here so i&#39;ve got both

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:03.760
Caption: implementations here and what i can do

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.440
Caption: is i can use the feature toggle i&#39;ll put

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.359
Caption: a feature toggle in front of it and we

00:22:05.439 --> 00:22:10.079
Caption: can see that that feature toggle is by

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:12.798
Caption: default it&#39;s always off but my

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:14.079
Caption: implementation here um if if my feature

00:22:12.798 --> 00:22:17.359
Caption: tag was actually turned on at this given

00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:17.359
Caption: time i&#39;d use that new gateway

00:22:17.439 --> 00:22:22.558
Caption: um so yeah i can see where i&#39;ve always

00:22:19.119 --> 00:22:22.558
Caption: i&#39;ve defaulted always off here

00:22:22.798 --> 00:22:27.760
Caption: here&#39;s some unit tests because we always

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.760
Caption: have to test our code

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.599
Caption: and what we can see here is

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.520
Caption: we&#39;ve got this one test suite we&#39;re

00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:34.558
Caption: going to

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.479
Caption: test

00:22:34.558 --> 00:22:38.319
Caption: this old version of our gateway and a

00:22:36.479 --> 00:22:39.520
Caption: new version of a gateway with the same

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:43.119
Caption: test suite because we know that they

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:45.760
Caption: should behave the same mostly

00:22:43.119 --> 00:22:47.199
Caption: if we run our tests

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.079
Caption: with the old gateway we can run it with

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:51.519
Caption: that always off feature toggle there

00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:52.798
Caption: and if we want to test our new gateway

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.640
Caption: we can test it with that always-on

00:22:52.798 --> 00:22:57.519
Caption: feature toggle there we&#39;ll get the same

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.520
Caption: test suite over both

00:22:58.798 --> 00:23:04.479
Caption: we can plot feature toggles

00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:07.599
Caption: on a on a graph i guess

00:23:04.479 --> 00:23:09.599
Caption: plotting longevity versus evaluation

00:23:07.599 --> 00:23:11.280
Caption: and our static toggles land in this sort

00:23:09.599 --> 00:23:12.880
Caption: of bottom corner down here they&#39;re

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.520
Caption: grouped under a section of toggles

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.959
Caption: called i call release toggles

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.039
Caption: and the idea is you might use something

00:23:16.959 --> 00:23:20.479
Caption: like this for a couple of days while

00:23:19.038 --> 00:23:21.678
Caption: you&#39;re collaborating on some new code

00:23:20.479 --> 00:23:23.038
Caption: that you&#39;re writing not going to be

00:23:21.678 --> 00:23:24.399
Caption: using these all the time by the way as

00:23:23.038 --> 00:23:26.239
Caption: well

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.159
Caption: and in terms of how how they&#39;re

00:23:26.239 --> 00:23:29.918
Caption: evaluated you get

00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:34.000
Caption: they kind of don&#39;t they land completely

00:23:29.918 --> 00:23:34.000
Caption: in that static kind of area down there

00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:39.520
Caption: let&#39;s uh continue on with some more

00:23:37.678 --> 00:23:42.399
Caption: different types of fiji toggles

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.679
Caption: so this is an environment toggle um a

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.039
Caption: lot of people might be quite familiar

00:23:43.678 --> 00:23:47.119
Caption: with something like this if you do a lot

00:23:45.038 --> 00:23:50.158
Caption: of node.js development but there&#39;ll be

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:52.640
Caption: equivalence in other languages as well

00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:54.400
Caption: these are also persisted in code

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.799
Caption: and the idea here is you might evaluate

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.760
Caption: this at either build time or startup

00:23:56.798 --> 00:23:59.839
Caption: so

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.599
Caption: if you&#39;re doing a web application using

00:23:59.839 --> 00:24:02.640
Caption: webpack you&#39;re actually evaluating stuff

00:24:01.599 --> 00:24:03.839
Caption: like this at build time and you&#39;re

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.279
Caption: building different versions of your

00:24:03.839 --> 00:24:06.959
Caption: application

00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:09.039
Caption: whereas other frameworks you might be

00:24:06.959 --> 00:24:10.719
Caption: doing that at startup you&#39;ll decide okay

00:24:09.038 --> 00:24:12.158
Caption: i&#39;m starting out what environment am i

00:24:10.719 --> 00:24:14.158
Caption: in i&#39;m going to set all my features

00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:15.440
Caption: there

00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:16.320
Caption: and these are great sorry i&#39;ll go back

00:24:15.439 --> 00:24:18.000
Caption: for a sec these are great for

00:24:16.319 --> 00:24:19.519
Caption: integration and uat testing you might

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.199
Caption: have multiple environments you want

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.520
Caption: features on in this environment but not

00:24:21.199 --> 00:24:25.918
Caption: that environment obviously

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.679
Caption: uh how are they used

00:24:25.918 --> 00:24:28.880
Caption: uh what we have here is

00:24:27.678 --> 00:24:30.079
Caption: we&#39;ve got a feature that we&#39;re wanting

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.918
Caption: to use

00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:33.278
Caption: we&#39;ve got this environment toggle here

00:24:31.918 --> 00:24:35.038
Caption: essentially we&#39;re checking if we&#39;re in

00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:36.400
Caption: the development environment

00:24:35.038 --> 00:24:37.519
Caption: in our development environment we want

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.080
Caption: to play around with toggles have

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.239
Caption: different stuff running so we can see

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:43.439
Caption: we check for that

00:24:42.239 --> 00:24:45.278
Caption: and then yeah

00:24:43.439 --> 00:24:47.278
Caption: if we&#39;re looking at our dev toggles here

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:48.640
Caption: we can check if we&#39;re matching certain

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:50.559
Caption: toggles what we want to have on what we

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.119
Caption: want to have off at the time

00:24:50.558 --> 00:24:54.239
Caption: but we get a guarantee here that

00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:56.239
Caption: if we&#39;re not in the development

00:24:54.239 --> 00:24:58.000
Caption: environment we turn everything off

00:24:56.239 --> 00:24:58.798
Caption: everything&#39;s every every new features

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.439
Caption: there

00:24:58.798 --> 00:25:02.558
Caption: is off that&#39;s really nice because um it

00:25:01.439 --> 00:25:03.678
Caption: gives you guarantee that you&#39;re not

00:25:02.558 --> 00:25:05.439
Caption: gonna accidentally run any of the

00:25:03.678 --> 00:25:08.239
Caption: software in the wrong environment um not

00:25:05.439 --> 00:25:08.239
Caption: when it&#39;s not ready

00:25:09.439 --> 00:25:12.879
Caption: environment toggles will are the sort of

00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:14.400
Caption: thing that are built into your software

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.239
Caption: development life cycle

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.479
Caption: so they&#39;ll last a little bit longer

00:25:16.239 --> 00:25:20.239
Caption: they&#39;ll go beyond just collaborating and

00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:22.000
Caption: experimenting with code they&#39;re built

00:25:20.239 --> 00:25:23.918
Caption: into the testing process so like i said

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Caption: you&#39;ll use them in your uat or

00:25:23.918 --> 00:25:28.158
Caption: integration environments

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.479
Caption: and they trend over towards the the

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:32.400
Caption: right a little bit in terms of um when

00:25:30.479 --> 00:25:34.880
Caption: they&#39;re evaluated so either build time

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.880
Caption: or start up

00:25:35.599 --> 00:25:38.880
Caption: moving on this is actually the type of

00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:41.440
Caption: feature talk that i was most familiar

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.798
Caption: with um when i started

00:25:41.439 --> 00:25:44.319
Caption: uh

00:25:42.798 --> 00:25:46.399
Caption: using them i guess

00:25:44.319 --> 00:25:47.759
Caption: this is an application toggle

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.679
Caption: and these are the most flexible so the

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.039
Caption: idea is that the persistence will vary

00:25:49.678 --> 00:25:52.158
Caption: when i was talking about

00:25:51.038 --> 00:25:54.879
Caption: where can your feature toggle be

00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:57.279
Caption: persisted could it be in a database or

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.239
Caption: in code or in a nosql database or

00:25:57.279 --> 00:25:59.440
Caption: something like that that&#39;s usually

00:25:58.239 --> 00:26:02.000
Caption: talking about these types of feature

00:25:59.439 --> 00:26:03.678
Caption: doubles here so this example

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.279
Caption: runs against the sql database i&#39;m

00:26:03.678 --> 00:26:07.678
Caption: running a sql query to decide whether

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:09.760
Caption: this feature toggles on or off

00:26:07.678 --> 00:26:12.000
Caption: and i can do that i can evaluate that

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.678
Caption: either at startup application starts up

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.719
Caption: i&#39;ll decide what&#39;s what&#39;s enabled what&#39;s

00:26:13.678 --> 00:26:15.678
Caption: not

00:26:14.719 --> 00:26:17.439
Caption: or

00:26:15.678 --> 00:26:19.119
Caption: i can do that per request as well i can

00:26:17.439 --> 00:26:22.000
Caption: turn things on and off while people are

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:23.599
Caption: using this application

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.959
Caption: talking about them being versatile and

00:26:23.599 --> 00:26:27.199
Caption: extendable

00:26:24.959 --> 00:26:28.880
Caption: what we could do is we could tweak the

00:26:27.199 --> 00:26:31.359
Caption: interface a little bit if we wanted so

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.359
Caption: we can create a user toggle which

00:26:31.359 --> 00:26:35.839
Caption: accepts two parameters instead of one

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:37.760
Caption: we&#39;ve got the feature name but also a

00:26:35.839 --> 00:26:39.918
Caption: user id

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.159
Caption: and then what we can do is enable

00:26:39.918 --> 00:26:44.719
Caption: features for certain users so a canary

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:46.320
Caption: toggle is a toggle based on

00:26:44.719 --> 00:26:47.918
Caption: identifiers

00:26:46.319 --> 00:26:49.599
Caption: identifiers of your user but not

00:26:47.918 --> 00:26:51.199
Caption: necessarily user maybe other things as

00:26:49.599 --> 00:26:52.798
Caption: well

00:26:51.199 --> 00:26:54.479
Caption: probably want to evaluate these ones per

00:26:52.798 --> 00:26:56.000
Caption: request if you&#39;ve got a lot of users you

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:57.839
Caption: can&#39;t really evaluate this once at

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.359
Caption: startup so this is something you do per

00:26:57.839 --> 00:27:02.640
Caption: request

00:26:59.359 --> 00:27:04.839
Caption: and this is useful for canary releases

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.839
Caption: but hence the name

00:27:04.839 --> 00:27:10.239
Caption: right another type of toggle you might

00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:13.038
Caption: use um in this kind of familiar to this

00:27:10.239 --> 00:27:15.839
Caption: one as well is a calculated toggle

00:27:13.038 --> 00:27:18.239
Caption: so the idea here is um these are these

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:20.158
Caption: go back to being persisted in code

00:27:18.239 --> 00:27:21.520
Caption: um we&#39;re not going to ask a database for

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:23.440
Caption: something like that but what we&#39;ll do is

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.679
Caption: we&#39;ll do a calculation of those per user

00:27:23.439 --> 00:27:28.319
Caption: attributes so something like the user id

00:27:25.678 --> 00:27:31.278
Caption: um and we&#39;ll use that in order to split

00:27:28.319 --> 00:27:32.558
Caption: our traffic um in a certain way what we

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:35.119
Caption: can do is

00:27:32.558 --> 00:27:36.319
Caption: this example here we&#39;ve got a hash

00:27:35.119 --> 00:27:37.599
Caption: um

00:27:36.319 --> 00:27:39.599
Caption: you don&#39;t want to see how that sausage

00:27:37.599 --> 00:27:41.278
Caption: is made it&#39;s it&#39;s uh there&#39;s quite a

00:27:39.599 --> 00:27:42.880
Caption: complex little algorithm there but the

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:44.720
Caption: idea is you input a string and you get a

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.640
Caption: number that&#39;s somewhere between one and

00:27:44.719 --> 00:27:48.798
Caption: zero and what we can do is our

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.640
Caption: calculator toggle just checks if that

00:27:48.798 --> 00:27:51.918
Caption: number is greater than 0.05 that&#39;s

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.479
Caption: actually going to split our cohort

00:27:51.918 --> 00:27:56.398
Caption: essentially in half

00:27:54.479 --> 00:27:58.079
Caption: again you&#39;d evaluate this per request

00:27:56.399 --> 00:28:00.480
Caption: and this is something you&#39;d use in a b

00:27:58.079 --> 00:28:00.479
Caption: testing

00:28:01.119 --> 00:28:05.520
Caption: so we can see these three types of

00:28:03.199 --> 00:28:07.038
Caption: feature toggles they they uh they land

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.119
Caption: in this kind of section called

00:28:07.038 --> 00:28:11.119
Caption: experiment toggles

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:13.199
Caption: uh what we can see is

00:28:11.119 --> 00:28:15.038
Caption: um they trend more towards the right

00:28:13.199 --> 00:28:17.359
Caption: where they&#39;re evaluated typically per

00:28:15.038 --> 00:28:18.798
Caption: request although sometimes not

00:28:17.359 --> 00:28:20.959
Caption: and these are something you&#39;ll leave in

00:28:18.798 --> 00:28:22.639
Caption: your system a little bit longer still

00:28:20.959 --> 00:28:24.158
Caption: something you want to have running in

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.880
Caption: production you can play around with turn

00:28:24.159 --> 00:28:26.880
Caption: things off and on

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:33.678
Caption: there&#39;s another type of feature toggle

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:36.079
Caption: this is a circuit breaker so like a

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:39.038
Caption: canary toggle or a calculated toggle is

00:28:36.079 --> 00:28:40.479
Caption: a calculation of user attributes a

00:28:39.038 --> 00:28:41.439
Caption: circuit breaker is slightly different

00:28:40.479 --> 00:28:42.959
Caption: it&#39;s a

00:28:41.439 --> 00:28:44.639
Caption: it&#39;s based on a calculation of your

00:28:42.959 --> 00:28:47.119
Caption: current system health

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.880
Caption: um so what you want to do is evaluate

00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:50.158
Caption: that probably per request as well you

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.239
Caption: wouldn&#39;t want to evaluate that at

00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:53.679
Caption: startup because your system help at

00:28:52.239 --> 00:28:55.599
Caption: startup&#39;s not the same as it&#39;s going to

00:28:53.678 --> 00:28:56.959
Caption: be later on

00:28:55.599 --> 00:28:58.959
Caption: and then in this example what we&#39;re

00:28:56.959 --> 00:29:00.719
Caption: doing here is um

00:28:58.959 --> 00:29:02.880
Caption: uh we&#39;re checking for queue depth so

00:29:00.719 --> 00:29:04.558
Caption: essentially if if our queue is getting

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.959
Caption: too long if we&#39;ve got too many things to

00:29:04.558 --> 00:29:08.640
Caption: process what we can do is return files

00:29:06.959 --> 00:29:10.319
Caption: and we can back off we can

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.440
Caption: essentially stop adding new things to

00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:13.759
Caption: that queue

00:29:11.439 --> 00:29:15.119
Caption: we can disable features if our system

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.359
Caption: health

00:29:15.119 --> 00:29:19.119
Caption: isn&#39;t looking too good

00:29:17.359 --> 00:29:21.678
Caption: these are really useful for operational

00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:21.678
Caption: purposes

00:29:22.239 --> 00:29:24.959
Caption: similarly

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.760
Caption: there&#39;s the idea of a kill switch as

00:29:24.959 --> 00:29:30.798
Caption: well so this code example

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.399
Caption: is for an express middleware and we can

00:29:30.798 --> 00:29:34.158
Caption: actually see a different feature toggles

00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:36.559
Caption: embedded in there but the idea here is

00:29:34.159 --> 00:29:38.720
Caption: we can just disable an entire endpoint

00:29:36.558 --> 00:29:40.158
Caption: that we don&#39;t we don&#39;t want to um

00:29:38.719 --> 00:29:41.839
Caption: our customers to have access to maybe

00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:45.200
Caption: something&#39;s broken it&#39;s not working or

00:29:41.839 --> 00:29:47.119
Caption: maybe that endpoint is being abused

00:29:45.199 --> 00:29:49.199
Caption: and this is essentially just a manually

00:29:47.119 --> 00:29:51.359
Caption: managed circuit breaker so we&#39;ll notice

00:29:49.199 --> 00:29:52.880
Caption: a problem um the difference here is it&#39;s

00:29:51.359 --> 00:29:54.158
Caption: not automated whether that feature

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:57.039
Caption: toggles on or off we&#39;re doing that

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:57.039
Caption: manually yourself

00:29:57.279 --> 00:30:00.640
Caption: these feature toggles

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.918
Caption: um because they&#39;re operational toggles

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.760
Caption: they&#39;re going to last a lot longer in

00:30:01.918 --> 00:30:05.278
Caption: our system we don&#39;t really know when

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.880
Caption: exactly we&#39;re going to need to use these

00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:08.559
Caption: or not they&#39;re probably going to live in

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.199
Caption: your system a little bit longer

00:30:08.558 --> 00:30:13.599
Caption: um so longevity is somewhere up in in

00:30:11.199 --> 00:30:15.519
Caption: months maybe even indefinitely

00:30:13.599 --> 00:30:17.599
Caption: and we can also see

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.119
Caption: as well the the there&#39;s an overlap there

00:30:17.599 --> 00:30:20.558
Caption: with that application toggle as well so

00:30:19.119 --> 00:30:22.158
Caption: you can use those um you might have seen

00:30:20.558 --> 00:30:24.000
Caption: inside the kill switch there was that

00:30:22.159 --> 00:30:27.600
Caption: application toggle as well

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.760
Caption: um so you can see some overlap there

00:30:27.599 --> 00:30:31.119
Caption: the last category of feature toggles i

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.719
Caption: want to talk about is something called

00:30:31.119 --> 00:30:34.479
Caption: customization

00:30:32.719 --> 00:30:36.398
Caption: um so you might have heard customization

00:30:34.479 --> 00:30:38.398
Caption: versus personalization before

00:30:36.399 --> 00:30:40.239
Caption: talk about that in a sec but

00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:42.559
Caption: this example here i haven&#39;t got any code

00:30:40.239 --> 00:30:45.038
Caption: to show you but this example here is

00:30:42.558 --> 00:30:48.079
Caption: github so they&#39;ve got a little feature

00:30:45.038 --> 00:30:50.158
Caption: preview model that you can access

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:51.599
Caption: and if you&#39;re if you want you can enable

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:52.640
Caption: certain features that they&#39;re currently

00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:53.839
Caption: running through they don&#39;t want everyone

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.760
Caption: to have access to it but if you&#39;re

00:30:53.839 --> 00:30:57.599
Caption: interested in using that feature you can

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.199
Caption: enable that yourself

00:30:57.599 --> 00:31:01.119
Caption: um you have control over it that&#39;s the

00:30:59.199 --> 00:31:05.038
Caption: important part that differentiates

00:31:01.119 --> 00:31:06.640
Caption: customization versus personalization

00:31:05.038 --> 00:31:08.639
Caption: so these customizations are the sort of

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.399
Caption: thing you might want to run for a longer

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.399
Caption: period of time as well

00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:14.399
Caption: they fall under a category of toggles

00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:17.440
Caption: called permission toggles we can see

00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:19.279
Caption: that the canary lives in here as well

00:31:17.439 --> 00:31:21.199
Caption: this is the differentiation between

00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:23.600
Caption: customization and personalization so

00:31:21.199 --> 00:31:25.518
Caption: personalization are those canary toggles

00:31:23.599 --> 00:31:28.158
Caption: and personalizations are the the

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:30.080
Caption: difference there is whether we as the

00:31:28.159 --> 00:31:31.120
Caption: developers or the people making the

00:31:30.079 --> 00:31:32.719
Caption: product

00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:34.640
Caption: deciding whether those feature toggles

00:31:32.719 --> 00:31:36.959
Caption: are shown to those customers all those

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:40.479
Caption: features are versus customization those

00:31:36.959 --> 00:31:40.479
Caption: customers are opting in themselves

00:31:42.239 --> 00:31:44.959
Caption: so i&#39;ve shown you a bunch of different

00:31:43.439 --> 00:31:46.719
Caption: types of feature toggles and what they

00:31:44.959 --> 00:31:49.119
Caption: look like let&#39;s quickly talk about some

00:31:46.719 --> 00:31:50.398
Caption: techniques and strategy

00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:51.599
Caption: so if you remember branching by

00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:54.080
Caption: abstraction in our trunk based

00:31:51.599 --> 00:31:56.000
Caption: development stuff

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:58.079
Caption: before when we had feature branches what

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.760
Caption: we did is we we put all of our branching

00:31:58.079 --> 00:32:01.439
Caption: into our source control so we&#39;d have

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.199
Caption: lots of branches running different

00:32:01.439 --> 00:32:04.959
Caption: versions of the software there and that

00:32:03.199 --> 00:32:07.199
Caption: was quite hard to manage many many

00:32:04.959 --> 00:32:08.798
Caption: branches lots of merge conflicts when

00:32:07.199 --> 00:32:10.158
Caption: we&#39;re trying to merge things over the

00:32:08.798 --> 00:32:12.398
Caption: top of each other

00:32:10.159 --> 00:32:14.559
Caption: difficult right branching is bad

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:16.080
Caption: but we did have versions of our code

00:32:14.558 --> 00:32:17.678
Caption: that didn&#39;t have as many branches in

00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:19.918
Caption: them so we&#39;d have this linear code

00:32:17.678 --> 00:32:21.439
Caption: execution paths

00:32:19.918 --> 00:32:23.439
Caption: when we moved to trunk based development

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:26.239
Caption: we didn&#39;t solve that problem all we did

00:32:23.439 --> 00:32:27.599
Caption: was move it so we moved our branching

00:32:26.239 --> 00:32:30.158
Caption: our stuff that&#39;s hard that we don&#39;t

00:32:27.599 --> 00:32:32.398
Caption: really like we move that into our code

00:32:30.159 --> 00:32:34.320
Caption: that&#39;s not necessarily bad like code&#39;s

00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:36.239
Caption: easier to work with it&#39;s it&#39;s nicer and

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:38.158
Caption: we get more flexibility and control

00:32:36.239 --> 00:32:40.079
Caption: whereas source control&#39;s a bit rigid and

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:41.440
Caption: has limitations right

00:32:40.079 --> 00:32:44.239
Caption: but we just moved the problem that&#39;s

00:32:41.439 --> 00:32:44.239
Caption: important to note

00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:46.880
Caption: so

00:32:45.439 --> 00:32:48.639
Caption: there&#39;s three things that are

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.519
Caption: potentially true of any long-lived

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.760
Caption: feature branch this is feature branches

00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:55.279
Caption: um in our old way of working

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.119
Caption: any feature branch that&#39;s been around

00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:58.240
Caption: for a long time has either already been

00:32:57.119 --> 00:32:59.839
Caption: merged

00:32:58.239 --> 00:33:02.158
Caption: or it can&#39;t be merged there&#39;s too many

00:32:59.839 --> 00:33:04.479
Caption: conflicts it&#39;s not possible anymore

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:06.960
Caption: or it&#39;s code that&#39;s no longer relevant

00:33:04.479 --> 00:33:08.640
Caption: it&#39;s been superseded by something else

00:33:06.959 --> 00:33:10.798
Caption: and the same

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.640
Caption: three or similar three

00:33:10.798 --> 00:33:14.398
Caption: characteristics are true of any feature

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.079
Caption: toggle you&#39;ve had in your system for a

00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:18.159
Caption: very long period of time

00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:18.880
Caption: so those feature toggles are permanently

00:33:18.159 --> 00:33:20.640
Caption: on

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.079
Caption: or they&#39;re permanently off so you can

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.599
Caption: remove them

00:33:22.079 --> 00:33:25.119
Caption: otherwise if they&#39;re somewhere in the

00:33:23.599 --> 00:33:27.119
Caption: middle like they&#39;re a canary that&#39;s been

00:33:25.119 --> 00:33:28.239
Caption: running for a very long period of time

00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:30.399
Caption: you&#39;re actually probably at the stage

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:31.839
Caption: with that isn&#39;t a feature toggle anymore

00:33:30.399 --> 00:33:34.159
Caption: it&#39;s actually part of your business

00:33:31.839 --> 00:33:34.158
Caption: logic

00:33:35.119 --> 00:33:40.079
Caption: so we want to be removing toggles where

00:33:36.798 --> 00:33:41.760
Caption: we can our idea here is that

00:33:40.079 --> 00:33:43.518
Caption: basically in all three of these cases

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.279
Caption: here we can we can remove that feature

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:46.960
Caption: toggle if it&#39;s been around for a very

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:48.399
Caption: long period of time so

00:33:46.959 --> 00:33:50.398
Caption: let&#39;s make sure we remove our feature

00:33:48.399 --> 00:33:52.239
Caption: toggles

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:53.760
Caption: essentially one thing to remember here

00:33:52.239 --> 00:33:56.079
Caption: one thing to take away is that every

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.678
Caption: feature toggle should have an expiry so

00:33:56.079 --> 00:33:59.119
Caption: here&#39;s an interesting piece of code this

00:33:57.678 --> 00:34:00.239
Caption: is a test

00:33:59.119 --> 00:34:02.319
Caption: um

00:34:00.239 --> 00:34:04.319
Caption: what we have here is the toggle like

00:34:02.319 --> 00:34:05.918
Caption: it&#39;s a test that fails um if your

00:34:04.319 --> 00:34:07.278
Caption: feature toggle is still in the system

00:34:05.918 --> 00:34:09.678
Caption: after one month

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:12.239
Caption: i wouldn&#39;t recommend doing this because

00:34:09.678 --> 00:34:14.000
Caption: what happens with something like this is

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:16.479
Caption: yeah your developer who&#39;s working on the

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.959
Caption: code at the time sees this random test

00:34:16.479 --> 00:34:21.040
Caption: failing um and what they&#39;ll do is

00:34:18.959 --> 00:34:22.719
Caption: they&#39;ll just remove that test so that

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:25.119
Caption: isn&#39;t going to work very well or they&#39;ll

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:26.320
Caption: change the date to 2022. developers are

00:34:25.118 --> 00:34:27.118
Caption: lazy

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.119
Caption: so

00:34:27.118 --> 00:34:31.760
Caption: the best way to approach this instead is

00:34:29.118 --> 00:34:34.559
Caption: to remove feature toggles proactively

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:36.398
Caption: make an effort to do it um make sure you

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.639
Caption: go and check and see if anything&#39;s still

00:34:36.398 --> 00:34:41.598
Caption: still in use and don&#39;t do that yourself

00:34:38.638 --> 00:34:41.598
Caption: but do it proactively

00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:45.919
Caption: the other lesson

00:34:43.118 --> 00:34:48.959
Caption: is naming toggles so i&#39;ve got a feature

00:34:45.918 --> 00:34:51.040
Caption: toggle here it&#39;s called internal staff

00:34:48.959 --> 00:34:52.878
Caption: and we can see it uses one version of a

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.879
Caption: payment gateway or another

00:34:52.878 --> 00:34:56.638
Caption: internal staff or not

00:34:54.878 --> 00:34:58.719
Caption: problem here is this feature toggle&#39;s

00:34:56.638 --> 00:35:00.559
Caption: naming is a bit vague and

00:34:58.719 --> 00:35:02.479
Caption: if i dig a little bit what i find is

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.160
Caption: that it&#39;s being used in other places so

00:35:02.479 --> 00:35:05.838
Caption: this isn&#39;t good

00:35:04.159 --> 00:35:07.039
Caption: the problem here is i&#39;ve got a feature

00:35:05.839 --> 00:35:08.000
Caption: toggle

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.679
Caption: that

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.040
Caption: when i turn it on i actually don&#39;t

00:35:09.679 --> 00:35:12.639
Caption: really know all the things that it could

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:15.280
Caption: be potentially either enabling or

00:35:12.639 --> 00:35:17.358
Caption: disabling it&#39;s not very specific

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.719
Caption: looks like here i get a new version of a

00:35:17.358 --> 00:35:20.719
Caption: payment gateway

00:35:18.719 --> 00:35:23.118
Caption: but also i send different emails and i

00:35:20.719 --> 00:35:25.199
Caption: use different algorithms so do i want to

00:35:23.118 --> 00:35:27.519
Caption: turn this on or not

00:35:25.199 --> 00:35:29.598
Caption: so it&#39;s important to be specific

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.599
Caption: we&#39;re talking about names let&#39;s try and

00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:34.320
Caption: come up with a better name right

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:36.240
Caption: what if we took the jira ticket and just

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.160
Caption: stuck that in there well now you&#39;ve got

00:35:36.239 --> 00:35:39.679
Caption: this problem where if i&#39;m looking at a

00:35:38.159 --> 00:35:42.159
Caption: feature toggle and wanting to work out

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:44.319
Caption: what it does i now have to jump into

00:35:42.159 --> 00:35:46.879
Caption: jira and i don&#39;t really like euro it&#39;s

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.560
Caption: slow and hard i&#39;m just i&#39;m

00:35:46.879 --> 00:35:50.399
Caption: putting in indirection for the sake of

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:53.119
Caption: it so that&#39;s not great so avoid

00:35:50.399 --> 00:35:55.358
Caption: indirection as well

00:35:53.118 --> 00:35:56.639
Caption: the other thing is naming wise don&#39;t be

00:35:55.358 --> 00:35:58.159
Caption: don&#39;t be cutesy because that&#39;s the same

00:35:56.639 --> 00:35:58.959
Caption: thing that&#39;s just in direction as well

00:35:58.159 --> 00:36:00.639
Caption: so

00:35:58.959 --> 00:36:02.000
Caption: if i&#39;m looking at that feature toggle

00:36:00.639 --> 00:36:03.679
Caption: this feature toggle called george i

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.800
Caption: don&#39;t know what that does if i&#39;ve just

00:36:03.679 --> 00:36:07.040
Caption: got that i haven&#39;t got this i haven&#39;t

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.959
Caption: got the code i&#39;m just looking at george

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.280
Caption: it doesn&#39;t tell me what it does so

00:36:08.959 --> 00:36:13.118
Caption: probably a best the best version

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.599
Caption: of a name for this particular feature

00:36:13.118 --> 00:36:17.760
Caption: toggle is use old payment gateway or

00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:19.119
Caption: something like that so that if it&#39;s on i

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.599
Caption: know i&#39;m going to that old payment

00:36:19.118 --> 00:36:21.598
Caption: gateway

00:36:22.159 --> 00:36:26.319
Caption: lastly i think it&#39;s important to also

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.920
Caption: make sure you have an audit log of some

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.400
Caption: kind

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:32.000
Caption: when you&#39;re using feature toggles

00:36:30.399 --> 00:36:33.598
Caption: just because

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.760
Caption: you&#39;re changing the way your application

00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:37.680
Caption: works right so

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.639
Caption: if there&#39;s something that goes wrong as

00:36:37.679 --> 00:36:41.919
Caption: a result of that we really need to know

00:36:40.639 --> 00:36:44.078
Caption: uh

00:36:41.919 --> 00:36:45.598
Caption: i guess when when that change happens so

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:46.800
Caption: that we can kind of track that down and

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:48.480
Caption: make sure that

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.040
Caption: we&#39;re able to fix that so it&#39;s a

00:36:48.479 --> 00:36:51.040
Caption: debugging

00:36:51.199 --> 00:36:55.280
Caption: it&#39;s a debugging problem

00:36:53.679 --> 00:36:56.719
Caption: so if we go and look at all the

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.320
Caption: different types of feature toggles that

00:36:56.719 --> 00:37:00.159
Caption: we have

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:03.040
Caption: using an audit log kind of differs

00:37:00.159 --> 00:37:04.559
Caption: depending on what you&#39;re doing

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.400
Caption: when you have these

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.920
Caption: static and environment toggles it&#39;s

00:37:06.399 --> 00:37:10.319
Caption: actually really easy you&#39;ve already got

00:37:07.919 --> 00:37:12.799
Caption: an audit log because those those feature

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.400
Caption: toggles live in code so

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.239
Caption: um anything that lives in code is

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:19.520
Caption: already audited by source control that&#39;s

00:37:16.239 --> 00:37:19.520
Caption: really nice we don&#39;t have to do anything

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:26.640
Caption: if you&#39;ve got some of these

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.959
Caption: database driven ones or these

00:37:26.639 --> 00:37:30.399
Caption: application feature toggles

00:37:28.959 --> 00:37:32.078
Caption: what you might want to use is a change

00:37:30.399 --> 00:37:34.159
Caption: log and you want that change log to live

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:37.440
Caption: probably close to where the actual value

00:37:34.159 --> 00:37:39.118
Caption: of the feature toggles persisted

00:37:37.439 --> 00:37:40.800
Caption: so if you&#39;re putting your feature

00:37:39.118 --> 00:37:42.399
Caption: talkers in a database have a secondary

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.280
Caption: table that tells us when those feature

00:37:42.399 --> 00:37:45.279
Caption: toggles were changed

00:37:45.839 --> 00:37:49.440
Caption: and lastly if you&#39;ve got one of the

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.679
Caption: calculated styles of feature toggles so

00:37:49.439 --> 00:37:53.598
Caption: the circuit breaker or a calculated a b

00:37:51.679 --> 00:37:55.760
Caption: test feature toggle um you need some

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:57.440
Caption: sort of decision log just log when a

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.599
Caption: decision was made

00:37:57.439 --> 00:38:01.118
Caption: about enabling a feature or disabling a

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:03.040
Caption: feature that can that doesn&#39;t actually

00:38:01.118 --> 00:38:05.598
Caption: have to be too complicated just log

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:09.439
Caption: message send it to your log aggregator

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:09.440
Caption: and then you can just track it later

00:38:10.239 --> 00:38:13.839
Caption: cool so these are the lessons the

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Caption: techniques

00:38:13.839 --> 00:38:18.000
Caption: remove feature toggles proactively use

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.280
Caption: deliberate and descriptive naming and

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.839
Caption: make sure to use an audit log that&#39;s

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.839
Caption: really important

00:38:22.399 --> 00:38:25.039
Caption: cool

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.800
Caption: so i think it&#39;s important to look back

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.239
Caption: over the history of software development

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.359
Caption: and draw from some of the lessons that

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:31.118
Caption: we&#39;ve learned

00:38:29.358 --> 00:38:33.358
Caption: over this journey so we might assume

00:38:31.118 --> 00:38:35.118
Caption: that techniques like feature toggling

00:38:33.358 --> 00:38:37.439
Caption: they kind of just appeared one day but

00:38:35.118 --> 00:38:38.879
Caption: the reality is we went through a journey

00:38:37.439 --> 00:38:40.959
Caption: of

00:38:38.879 --> 00:38:43.358
Caption: lots of failures and learning from those

00:38:40.959 --> 00:38:43.358
Caption: failures

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.280
Caption: we talked about the many forms of

00:38:46.879 --> 00:38:51.679
Caption: uh feature toggle that you can have

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.000
Caption: um and how they map in terms of

00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:54.000
Caption: um

00:38:54.079 --> 00:38:58.079
Caption: sorry how they map in terms of uh

00:38:56.399 --> 00:39:00.959
Caption: plotting them in terms of evaluation

00:38:58.079 --> 00:39:02.960
Caption: versus longevity so evaluation being how

00:39:00.959 --> 00:39:04.399
Caption: often are we are we looking for that

00:39:02.959 --> 00:39:05.280
Caption: value and how often does that value

00:39:04.399 --> 00:39:06.639
Caption: change

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.320
Caption: versus

00:39:06.639 --> 00:39:09.760
Caption: how long we just we

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.719
Caption: deciding that feature toggle is going to

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:15.199
Caption: live for in our system

00:39:12.719 --> 00:39:16.560
Caption: and like any technique that we have in

00:39:15.199 --> 00:39:18.399
Caption: software development and software

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.680
Caption: architecture there&#39;s always going to be

00:39:18.399 --> 00:39:20.639
Caption: trade-offs

00:39:19.679 --> 00:39:22.078
Caption: so

00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:23.598
Caption: the best example here is we wanted to

00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:24.960
Caption: avoid branching and source control

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:26.960
Caption: because it was rigid and it was

00:39:24.959 --> 00:39:28.879
Caption: difficult and merge conflicts are hard

00:39:26.959 --> 00:39:30.560
Caption: right

00:39:28.879 --> 00:39:32.479
Caption: but all we ended up doing was taking

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.400
Caption: that branching strategy and moving that

00:39:32.479 --> 00:39:35.838
Caption: somewhere else it moved into our code so

00:39:34.399 --> 00:39:38.879
Caption: now we have to have appropriate

00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:40.480
Caption: mechanisms to deal with that as well

00:39:38.879 --> 00:39:42.799
Caption: be aware of some of the techniques that

00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:44.879
Caption: we have at our disposal and the many

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.199
Caption: ways that we can use them

00:39:44.879 --> 00:39:49.118
Caption: as well as how to use them properly

00:39:47.199 --> 00:39:50.719
Caption: use feature toggles as a tool to plan

00:39:49.118 --> 00:39:52.159
Caption: for the unexpected

00:39:50.719 --> 00:39:54.320
Caption: because the unexpected is something

00:39:52.159 --> 00:39:56.239
Caption: that&#39;s always going to happen take this

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.320
Caption: picture and basically the whole story of

00:39:56.239 --> 00:40:00.159
Caption: this movie

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.680
Caption: uh planning for the unexpected can make

00:40:00.159 --> 00:40:04.399
Caption: a huge difference to the difference to

00:40:01.679 --> 00:40:05.919
Caption: the success of your product

00:40:04.399 --> 00:40:08.399
Caption: but also the experience for your

00:40:05.919 --> 00:40:08.399
Caption: customers

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.520
Caption: i&#39;m going to thank the sponsors again um

00:40:12.399 --> 00:40:15.358
Caption: as i can

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.919
Caption: but also i want to point out that i work

00:40:15.358 --> 00:40:19.759
Caption: for one of the companies on this slide

00:40:17.919 --> 00:40:20.959
Caption: that&#39;s these guys here

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.439
Caption: if

00:40:20.959 --> 00:40:25.439
Caption: uh feature toggles and the idea of using

00:40:23.439 --> 00:40:27.199
Caption: them is interesting to you we use them a

00:40:25.439 --> 00:40:29.598
Caption: lot we play around with the various

00:40:27.199 --> 00:40:32.159
Caption: different versions and as well um we&#39;re

00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:33.839
Caption: also hiring i&#39;m up here doing the the

00:40:32.159 --> 00:40:35.838
Caption: hiring spiel because

00:40:33.839 --> 00:40:39.119
Caption: we&#39;re looking for people so if if you&#39;re

00:40:35.839 --> 00:40:41.920
Caption: interested come talk to me or um we have

00:40:39.118 --> 00:40:43.760
Caption: a booth down in in the back corner

00:40:41.919 --> 00:40:45.118
Caption: with jacob and travis down there i&#39;ll

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.239
Caption: give you a free pair of socks if you

00:40:45.118 --> 00:40:48.639
Caption: haven&#39;t got them already they look
