  "description": "Apps nowadays have an abundance of real-time events of every kind that enable a highly interactive experience to the user. We need tools for dealing with that and reactive programming comes to the rescue.\\n\\nIn this talk, I will introduce you to reactive paradigm using RxJS and JavaScript for examples. We\u0027ll talk about important principles when getting started with Rx, like observable and observer pattern, leveraging functional programming concepts, hot and cold observables and Rx operators.\\n\\nYou\u0027ll learn how to let go of old imperative and stateful programming habits, and stretch your brain to work in a different paradigm.\\n\\nRx is not restricted to client-side apps (it works great also in event-heavy backends), neither to a specific language (it is widely available in many dialects: .NET, Java, Scala, Clojure, JavaScript, Ruby, Kotlin, Swift, C\u002B\u002B, Elixir, etc.), so whatever your tools are, you can definitely benefit from it."
