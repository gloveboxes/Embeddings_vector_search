Caption: of work that will explain that a little

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.939

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:51.500
Caption: conversational user interface prior to

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:52.939

Caption: heard of the term conversational user

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:58.639

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.578

Caption: name is typically sent to find them

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.449
Caption: something&#39;s under seven eight years old

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:10.150

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:16.459

Caption: a technical practice manager there so a

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.340
Caption: lot of different things really but I

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.049
Caption: guess what really means is I get to

Caption: bit of a dream job for me there&#39;s no

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.939
Caption: toilet where an email I don&#39;t actively

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:48.860
Caption: tweet are more of a lurker than I can&#39;t

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.630
Caption: review but um I might throw up some

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.739
Caption: links if anyone asks about some of the

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:53.629

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:02.029
Caption: I&#39;ll cover office was this conversation

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.979
Caption: user interface - is there like about

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:06.680
Caption: 50/50 split who&#39;s heard of it before

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:08.059
Caption: now just looking around this whole bunch

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.130
Caption: of definitions this is one I found out

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:12.139
Caption: quite like cam nugatory program but

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.848
Caption: effectively what a conversational user

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.500
Caption: interface if you think about the

00:02:13.848 --> 00:02:17.598
Caption: relationship we&#39;ve had with computers

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.250
Caption: over the years basically has been

00:02:17.598 --> 00:02:20.750
Caption: completely on their terms we communicate

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.669
Caption: with them in a way that works for them

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.529
Caption: we learn the quickly little languages a

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.509
Caption: lot commands we learn their interfaces

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.699
Caption: it&#39;s all completely their ways they

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.988
Caption: needed to happen a conversational use

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.429
Caption: interface what&#39;s that right a little bit

00:02:29.988 --> 00:02:32.779
Caption: where they have to learn how to talk in

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.189
Caption: our terms effectively they have to learn

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:36.408
Caption: natural English or whatever language

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.809
Caption: you&#39;re actually talking in and they also

00:02:36.408 --> 00:02:40.458
Caption: tend to exhibit the behavior of

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:43.220
Caption: mimicking a human like a really good

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:45.940
Caption: conversational user interface and should

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.988
Caption: be indistinguishable from a human um

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.348
Caption: generally they&#39;re kind of separated into

00:02:47.988 --> 00:02:53.149
Caption: two broad areas at the moment the first

00:02:51.348 --> 00:02:55.009
Caption: ones voice assistant so I&#39;m sure

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.750
Caption: probably the vast majority have got a

00:02:55.009 --> 00:03:00.378
Caption: voice assistant of sorts in your pocket

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.029
Caption: Siri Google no propeller appear that way

00:03:00.378 --> 00:03:03.889
Caption: in claims and that LX is not really big

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:06.529
Caption: in Australia it&#39;s part of the Amazon

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:08.509
Caption: echo platform but it&#39;s one as well

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:10.069
Caption: so it&#39;s quite telling that like four out

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:11.360
Caption: of five billion ad companies in the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.509
Caption: world and women are investing in this

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.658
Caption: area and actually developing this it&#39;s

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:19.518
Caption: an okay area I mean personally at you

00:03:17.658 --> 00:03:21.348
Caption: can published an Australian so if me

00:03:19.518 --> 00:03:23.330
Caption: even a theory is actually a lot more

00:03:21.348 --> 00:03:24.979
Caption: challenging than most people I usually

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.860
Caption: have to seen an Australian accent to

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:29.899
Caption: actually get to do anything for me and

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.430
Caption: also I find they&#39;re a bit clunky I&#39;m

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:33.229
Caption: never quite sure what they can do for me

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:35.419
Caption: most of the time actually just it&#39;s like

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.589
Caption: cooking barbecue stuff like set timer a

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.259
Caption: few minutes that&#39;s about the extent I

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:42.319
Caption: actually use voice assistance for the

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:43.369
Caption: other category falls under chat box and

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.768
Caption: that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to talk a lot of

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:47.839
Caption: that vote today now but when thinking

00:03:45.768 --> 00:03:50.149
Caption: about chat BOTS I don&#39;t want to get

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:52.339
Caption: confused with the different types of

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:54.199
Caption: chat box there are chat BOTS exist and

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:56.089
Caption: like slack and what&#39;s up there other

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.619
Caption: platforms where you&#39;re basically issuing

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.539
Caption: splash command just a and slash you this

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:01.518
Caption: last you that and that&#39;s more of a

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:02.988
Caption: command-line interface in a chat

00:04:01.518 --> 00:04:05.169
Caption: platform that&#39;s not really what I&#39;m

00:04:02.988 --> 00:04:07.878
Caption: talking about when I talk about

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.988
Caption: conversational user interfaces and what

00:04:07.878 --> 00:04:11.419
Caption: I mean is something that you actually

00:04:08.988 --> 00:04:13.518
Caption: engage with as you would a person and

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:15.169
Caption: you initiate a conversation and it then

00:04:13.518 --> 00:04:16.369
Caption: talks and communicates with you to get

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.040
Caption: more information out of you before

00:04:16.369 --> 00:04:20.690
Caption: finally going off and doing a task so

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.850
Caption: there the common ones at the moment

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:31.789
Caption: stack what&#39;s up messenger Skype WeChat

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:33.740
Caption: so why do they want to build one and

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:36.829
Caption: like I say I mentioned of the Devourer

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:38.089
Caption: pet project um and when I was try to

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:39.559
Caption: think about this for the presentation

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:42.470
Caption: what were the reasons that I actually

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:44.630
Caption: wanted to build this and I kind of group

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.429
Caption: them roughly into categories and there&#39;s

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.369
Caption: the personal reasons and then there&#39;s

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:50.779
Caption: the professional reasons so we&#39;re going

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:52.250
Caption: to cover two pair the personal reasons

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.809
Caption: first off they&#39;re being called Norman

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.579
Caption: growing up in the 90s have unit

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:59.359
Caption: computers just had nerd written all over

00:04:55.579 --> 00:05:01.189
Caption: me it was unavoidable so you know then

00:04:59.359 --> 00:05:02.478
Caption: all the usual things Star Trek Dungeons

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.309
Caption: and Dragons all that kind of stuff and I

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.050
Caption: remember around about I can&#39;t remember

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:08.269
Caption: exactly playing right about 1985 when

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:09.259
Caption: the new series of Star Trek The Next

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:11.239
Caption: Generation came out and I remember

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.739
Caption: watching that when my dad and you super

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:14.809
Caption: enthusiastic about he&#39;s talking about

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:16.250
Caption: the old Star Trek sitting down and watch

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:18.109
Caption: it and you know there&#39;s just a whole

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.739
Caption: bunch of things you know fast and light

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:23.119
Caption: ships

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:24.289
Caption: huddle at holodecks klingon working with

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:25.669
Caption: them ed who&#39;s over to stuff but the

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.919
Caption: thing really stuck out for me was the

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.179
Caption: concept of Star Trek computer they kind

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.830
Caption: of just like dropped it in there

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:32.269
Caption: matter-of-factly where people could just

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:34.129
Caption: wander about this ship is there anything

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:35.539
Caption: like computer tell me I don&#39;t know

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.970
Caption: making some supercomputer do this

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.739
Caption: computer to that and that part like

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.149
Caption: really stuck with me I mean I remember

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:42.470
Caption: at the time trying to father my how

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:44.359
Caption: could something like that possibly work

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.369
Caption: how would it know that you were talking

00:05:44.359 --> 00:05:49.279
Caption: to it and trying to give an instruction

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:53.000
Caption: over referring to it in some other part

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:54.919
Caption: conversation so kind of Star Trek

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.509
Caption: definitely it was a big influence on on

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.309
Caption: me and that&#39;s our stuff so that that was

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.940
Caption: something I was really interested in

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:04.970
Caption: that&#39;s the Star Trek breakfast yeah and

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:09.019
Caption: more recently I guess probably back in

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:12.799
Caption: March I read an article about Jill

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:16.459

Caption: think he pronounced it&#39;s a French name

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:31.489
Caption: 100% I think that&#39;s how you pronounce it

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:34.790
Caption: and he&#39;s a concise professor at Georgia

00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:36.889
Caption: Tech and this state&#39;s um he runs

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.490
Caption: obviously the computer science program

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.800
Caption: there and the article this we like

00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:44.899

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:48.679
Caption: students he has to feel the roundabouts

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.660
Caption: and I could actually be the number at

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:53.119
Caption: the double check that the 10,000 queries

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.420
Caption: over the year from the students and it

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:57.739
Caption: comes on online forums girls or minors

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.180
Caption: and things silly things like you know

00:06:57.739 --> 00:07:00.789
Caption: when is this paper due

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:02.750
Caption: what do we need to know about this and

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.940
Caption: interestingly all the information is

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.440
Caption: actually available as seq s and a lot of

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.179
Caption: the web material that nobody actually

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.980
Caption: uses that they still just email this guy

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:13.130
Caption: so obviously over the years he&#39;s

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.270
Caption: developed a program that allows them to

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.119
Caption: deal with this he has what&#39;s called

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:18.769
Caption: eight TAS or technical systems okay and

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:20.630
Caption: I think there latter year students that

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:22.069
Caption: basically it goes toward extra credits

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.830
Caption: where they perform was a technical

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.390
Caption: system so these guys do the bulk of the

00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:29.779
Caption: work and a lot of it is fairly mundane

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:32.120
Caption: um last year they had a new technical

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:33.829
Caption: assistant called Jill Watson and she

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:36.320
Caption: quickly got a reputation for being

00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:39.039
Caption: really good like and quick answer really

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.910
Caption: quickly no matter when did or night and

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.950
Caption: always had the correct answer and

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.630
Caption: actually started answering questions

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.220
Caption: issued by the other TAS they were like I

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.489
Caption: don&#39;t know about this Angela typing I

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.600
Caption: actually I do this is what it is and you

00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:52.369
Caption: know everyone was raving about Jill

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.959
Caption: Watson how great job she was doing and

00:07:52.369 --> 00:07:56.149
Caption: the funny thing was nobody could be a

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:58.579
Caption: face to whoo Jill Watson actually was

00:07:56.149 --> 00:08:00.229
Caption: and then some people started creating it

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:02.089
Caption: and actually turned that Jill Watson was

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:06.260
Caption: IBM Watson running in the background and

00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:08.570
Caption: that this guy had run our trial program

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.309
Caption: I had to dig a bit deeper to get the

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.600
Caption: details on it but what they&#39;d actually

00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:12.169
Caption: done is for the first three months of

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.880
Caption: the year

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.440
Caption: Watson had actually just been monitoring

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.540
Caption: the flow of questions and the material

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.309
Caption: it was coming through and it was working

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.589
Caption: at how bad

00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:22.690
Caption: answer it now it started off not great

00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:24.699
Caption: and it was but it progressively got

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.750
Caption: better and better once it got to the

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:29.110
Caption: point where it was answering questions

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.730
Caption: with 97% of certainty and it was a

00:08:29.109 --> 00:08:32.859
Caption: correct answer they just Unleashed it

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:35.020
Caption: and it was a raging success I think

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:37.719
Caption: maybe one student who worked at it might

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.390
Caption: be a ball or a any I program work from

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:42.219
Caption: the background so that was a really cool

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.040
Caption: story not going to Reese Park my kind of

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:46.419
Caption: other stuff cool and I want to look at

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:48.279
Caption: and I guess kinda I&#39;ve always sort of

00:08:46.419 --> 00:08:49.959
Caption: weirdly been interested in this human

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.580
Caption: machine relationship I mean I don&#39;t know

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.860
Caption: about you guys I get very attached to my

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:57.070
Caption: hardware I have fear of winked and

00:08:53.859 --> 00:08:59.219
Caption: smiled at my Mac a few things but you

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:02.500
Caption: know and then every story is about like

00:08:59.219 --> 00:09:04.599
Caption: US military are divided in the US

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.150
Caption: military and the story about bomb

00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:09.069
Caption: disposal team data a giant body both

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:11.410
Caption: extended and they like physical robots

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.630
Caption: and they dismantle bombs and this robot

00:09:11.409 --> 00:09:15.219
Caption: had X amount of successful dismantles

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:17.320
Caption: and the team had just grown super

00:09:15.219 --> 00:09:19.149
Caption: attached it had a name that decorated it

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.500
Caption: and bombs things starting to break down

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.630
Caption: it was a machine so I had to go back for

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:25.119
Caption: servicing and what the team was super

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.830
Caption: adamant get that ball like that exact

00:09:25.119 --> 00:09:28.510
Caption: one comes back to us don&#39;t swap out for

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.070
Caption: another one it has to be that ball so

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.720
Caption: it&#39;s kind of shows that the

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.520
Caption: relationships people build up with

00:09:31.719 --> 00:09:36.009
Caption: technology is actually in this weird

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.160
Caption: transition period so yeah it&#39;s just an

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:40.540
Caption: interesting really obviously if I just

00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:41.559
Caption: said all that work and said hey I&#39;d like

00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:43.929
Caption: to build a conversation or user

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:45.250
Caption: interface I be told was insane and told

00:09:43.929 --> 00:09:48.159
Caption: no so I kind of had to start thinking

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:51.190
Caption: about how I could apply this in a sort

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:54.579
Caption: of practical context as I mentioned at

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:55.869
Caption: the start I work for seek and I guess

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.489
Caption: one of the things I thought that

00:09:55.869 --> 00:10:00.880
Caption: conversational user interfaces were

00:09:57.489 --> 00:10:03.479
Caption: particularly good at was taking hi I

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:06.520
Caption: guess how we say hi friction add

00:10:03.479 --> 00:10:08.349
Caption: difficult tasks and making them easy to

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.570
Caption: execute so that&#39;s a bit of my but what I

00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:12.159
Caption: mean by that is am something that would

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:15.250
Caption: ordinarily have a lot of stats and you

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:16.629
Caption: have a very large involvement with and

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.429
Caption: it&#39;s frustrating you can actually do

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:22.119
Caption: quite simply and with a conversational

00:10:18.429 --> 00:10:23.500
Caption: user interface so I looked around at

00:10:22.119 --> 00:10:25.750
Caption: some of the practical things that I

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.539
Caption: could do without and one of them came

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.409
Caption: out and was great obvious looking means

00:10:28.539 --> 00:10:31.508
Caption: I don&#39;t know

00:10:29.409 --> 00:10:33.098
Caption: how how many means you guys have to go

00:10:31.508 --> 00:10:35.558
Caption: and my job I have to go a lot means of

00:10:33.098 --> 00:10:37.539
Caption: course to organize along Inc and it&#39;s

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:39.729
Caption: it&#39;s one of the biggest beans of my life

00:10:37.539 --> 00:10:41.319
Caption: I hate doing it and basically if I have

00:10:39.729 --> 00:10:43.388
Caption: a meeting with four or five people at

00:10:41.318 --> 00:10:45.008
Caption: don&#39;t look at again your appointment I

00:10:43.388 --> 00:10:47.169
Caption: have to add them into the calendar I

00:10:45.008 --> 00:10:49.078
Caption: then get the stretch their availability

00:10:47.169 --> 00:10:51.309
Caption: and have to comb through and look for a

00:10:49.078 --> 00:10:52.838
Caption: slot that matches everything you know

00:10:51.309 --> 00:10:55.629
Caption: the stars align greatly and I think

00:10:52.838 --> 00:10:57.039
Caption: great fun to slot and I think I forgot

00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:59.348
Caption: to add the room and go in and add the

00:10:57.039 --> 00:11:00.729
Caption: room and that we can&#39;t do that slots and

00:10:59.348 --> 00:11:02.768
Caption: then that back to help us look at it

00:11:00.729 --> 00:11:04.448
Caption: it&#39;s really painful that&#39;s before five

00:11:02.768 --> 00:11:06.128
Caption: people when it&#39;s large 30 people

00:11:04.448 --> 00:11:08.469
Caption: meetings that can get it becomes out who

00:11:06.129 --> 00:11:09.909
Caption: the hell so i actually so conceptually

00:11:08.469 --> 00:11:11.348
Caption: what am i trying to do here all the one

00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:16.059
Caption: to do is organize a meeting all i want

00:11:11.348 --> 00:11:17.708
Caption: to say is to wherever can you booked a

00:11:16.059 --> 00:11:19.419
Caption: meeting with these four people at the

00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:20.588
Caption: next available flow that&#39;s all i want to

00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:22.720
Caption: do so i thought that was actually a

00:11:20.588 --> 00:11:23.708
Caption: potential candidate for actually

00:11:22.719 --> 00:11:26.698
Caption: converting into something in a

00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:30.669
Caption: conversational user interface well

00:11:26.698 --> 00:11:34.838
Caption: another area that we have some

00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:36.549
Caption: challenges in at seek is feedback so the

00:11:34.838 --> 00:11:37.958
Caption: two case types of feedback there&#39;s a

00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:39.669
Caption: feedback that you give people day to day

00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.739
Caption: you know hey good job well done and

00:11:39.669 --> 00:11:44.350
Caption: there&#39;s a feedback that happens as part

00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:48.519
Caption: of your performance review so we use a

00:11:44.349 --> 00:11:51.188
Caption: system at work called work day and it&#39;s

00:11:48.518 --> 00:11:52.958
Caption: okay it does your job but the way that

00:11:51.189 --> 00:11:55.569
Caption: you actually give people feedback or get

00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:57.669
Caption: feedback in that you kinda have to open

00:11:55.568 --> 00:11:59.798
Caption: up chrome going a workday search for the

00:11:57.669 --> 00:12:01.268
Caption: person find the button that says give

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:02.619
Caption: feedback and it&#39;s very a weight of

00:12:01.268 --> 00:12:05.588
Caption: submenu somewhere i can never remember

00:12:02.619 --> 00:12:07.479
Caption: where it is so I just don&#39;t because

00:12:05.588 --> 00:12:09.158
Caption: that&#39;s just painful and then likewise

00:12:07.479 --> 00:12:10.720
Caption: when should be asked me for feedback

00:12:09.158 --> 00:12:12.818
Caption: Africa&#39;s through a similar process so

00:12:10.719 --> 00:12:14.288
Caption: I&#39;m not fan of it and what that means is

00:12:12.818 --> 00:12:15.188
Caption: you get to the end of the year and you

00:12:14.289 --> 00:12:16.989
Caption: know you&#39;re talking about the end of

00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:18.309
Caption: your performance review and let&#39;s talk

00:12:16.989 --> 00:12:20.109
Caption: about all the feedback you got nobody&#39;s

00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:21.789
Caption: got a so they what happens is you get

00:12:20.109 --> 00:12:23.229
Caption: this tidal wave of feedback requests

00:12:21.789 --> 00:12:24.220
Caption: coming through and I have to and it&#39;s

00:12:23.229 --> 00:12:25.898
Caption: like can you please give me some

00:12:24.219 --> 00:12:28.328
Caption: feedback on that project we worked on

00:12:25.898 --> 00:12:28.729
Caption: nine months ago it&#39;s like no I can&#39;t

00:12:28.328 --> 00:12:30.500
Caption: remember

00:12:28.729 --> 00:12:32.148
Caption: think about that to be honest so you

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.708
Caption: know really all I actually want to do is

00:12:32.148 --> 00:12:35.778
Caption: at the point in time when it happens

00:12:33.708 --> 00:12:37.698
Caption: give something say hey it just worked

00:12:35.778 --> 00:12:40.070
Caption: with Dave on this project he did an

00:12:37.698 --> 00:12:41.838
Caption: awesome job I just like to give us some

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:44.119
Caption: positive feedback are words that thanks

00:12:41.838 --> 00:12:45.440
Caption: but the system we use at the moment - so

00:12:44.119 --> 00:12:48.099
Caption: nobody does it so I thought about maybe

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.539
Caption: another potential candidate for a

00:12:48.099 --> 00:12:52.549
Caption: conversational user interface and then

00:12:50.539 --> 00:12:54.799
Caption: the last one there&#39;s I&#39;m sure you go to

00:12:52.549 --> 00:12:57.679
Caption: have many companies you know there&#39;s

00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:58.969
Caption: little magic questions we have boards up

00:12:57.679 --> 00:13:02.809
Caption: the tails all sorts of things like where

00:12:58.969 --> 00:13:04.638
Caption: guy shows how to log in to the VPN but

00:13:02.809 --> 00:13:06.320
Caption: nobody uses them it is usually we jump

00:13:04.638 --> 00:13:07.909
Caption: on our chat platform where you use them

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.320
Caption: there&#39;s one or two guys that basically

00:13:07.909 --> 00:13:10.759
Caption: the guys that you always ask where do I

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.739
Caption: get that either from hydrating solace

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.820
Caption: where&#39;s the key for this so so actually

00:13:12.739 --> 00:13:15.229
Caption: you know this is potentially something

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:16.578
Caption: that maybe take a little famine a bit in

00:13:15.229 --> 00:13:21.380
Caption: the vein of what was going on with fair

00:13:16.578 --> 00:13:22.820
Caption: Jane Watson so that was kind of personal

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.260
Caption: reasons and I guess these are the

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:30.190
Caption: professional uses these things that&#39;s

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:30.190
Caption: all I can I can work into my actual work

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:37.489
Caption: with me so far

00:13:32.049 --> 00:13:40.849
Caption: cool so building a prototype again I

00:13:37.489 --> 00:13:42.559
Caption: can&#39;t necessarily just decide that I&#39;m

00:13:40.849 --> 00:13:44.958
Caption: going to do this and I&#39;ve got regular

00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:48.289
Caption: work to do as well but luckily it&#39;s eke

00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:49.489
Caption: we run biannual hackathons I think a lot

00:13:48.289 --> 00:13:51.948
Caption: of companies are doing this now I think

00:13:49.489 --> 00:13:53.088
Caption: it&#39;s a great way to kind of flesh out

00:13:51.948 --> 00:13:56.208
Caption: ideas like this and actually get some

00:13:53.088 --> 00:13:57.500
Caption: traction but yeah we run a biannual

00:13:56.208 --> 00:14:00.138
Caption: hackathon and if you&#39;re not familiar

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.750
Caption: with the form of a hackathon effectively

00:14:00.138 --> 00:14:04.338
Caption: just before you have a date and time

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:05.898
Caption: it&#39;s going to take place and people

00:14:04.338 --> 00:14:08.208
Caption: start pitching ideas and the ideas are

00:14:05.898 --> 00:14:10.429
Caption: around internal efficiencies or making

00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:11.630
Caption: things better for our clients and it&#39;s

00:14:10.429 --> 00:14:15.078
Caption: open to the whole company people can

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:16.638
Caption: just submit ideas and and then we have

00:14:15.078 --> 00:14:18.799
Caption: like what&#39;s called the pitch pulpit

00:14:16.638 --> 00:14:21.169
Caption: where the people whose idea is gets up

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:22.338
Caption: and they make a heartfelt pitch about

00:14:21.169 --> 00:14:23.989
Caption: what they&#39;re trying to do in the

00:14:22.338 --> 00:14:25.599
Caption: Triangle I need technical reversal to do

00:14:23.989 --> 00:14:28.698
Caption: this I need marketing people can do that

00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:31.190
Caption: so that was a perfect opportunity for me

00:14:28.698 --> 00:14:34.549
Caption: to actually sort of spread my idea and

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:36.078
Caption: get him into have a look at and we had a

00:14:34.549 --> 00:14:37.398
Caption: three day hack where basically just do

00:14:36.078 --> 00:14:38.869
Caption: all regular work to one site and you

00:14:37.398 --> 00:14:42.769
Caption: have three days dedicated to work on

00:14:38.869 --> 00:14:47.299
Caption: so they&#39;re great for my ex-cons and

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:49.550
Caption: we&#39;ve actually not quite yet sitcom five

00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:51.619
Caption: percent of our audience in the moment or

00:14:49.549 --> 00:14:53.088
Caption: gang or brand-new and what&#39;s called

00:14:51.619 --> 00:14:55.099
Caption: homepage and search for search engine

00:14:53.088 --> 00:14:57.229
Caption: results page and that is the bread

00:14:55.099 --> 00:14:59.299
Caption: directly of a hackathon that was a react

00:14:57.229 --> 00:15:00.979
Caption: project like a while back when we&#39;re

00:14:59.299 --> 00:15:03.200
Caption: just looking at react so you know it

00:15:00.979 --> 00:15:06.649
Caption: actually does make it to food production

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.880
Caption: systems so obviously I had the kind of

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.200
Caption: time to do I had the people that were

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.150
Caption: interested in doing I have to think well

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.588
Caption: if we&#39;re going to do this sort of thing

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:16.070
Caption: how are we actually going to build is

00:15:12.588 --> 00:15:17.510
Caption: seek and first of all cloud to kind of

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.190
Caption: work out you know what platforms that&#39;s

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.350
Caption: going to be on now you know things like

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.729
Caption: Siri and that I just thought why I don&#39;t

00:15:21.349 --> 00:15:23.959
Caption: get all mostly that well anyway and I

00:15:22.729 --> 00:15:26.630
Caption: don&#39;t think that would actually work for

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:29.210
Caption: this type of format but what is really

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:32.239
Caption: prevalent to seek is slack because using

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:33.740
Caption: slack as one of their work half okay if

00:15:32.239 --> 00:15:35.209
Caption: you&#39;re not using I really recommend

00:15:33.739 --> 00:15:36.649
Caption: looking at it&#39;s become an integral part

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.300
Caption: to the way we do things that speak I

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.680
Caption: mean literally from teams just

00:15:38.299 --> 00:15:42.500
Caption: collaborating to wider teens

00:15:39.679 --> 00:15:43.429
Caption: collaborating to the I guess one of the

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.510
Caption: great things looks like is the

00:15:43.429 --> 00:15:46.278
Caption: integration of tools that you actually

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:48.109
Caption: get it tells us when our builds are

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:50.479
Caption: broken it tells us when the eyes are

00:15:48.109 --> 00:15:52.099
Caption: starting to wobble a little bit um is a

00:15:50.479 --> 00:15:54.019
Caption: really great tool so that year was

00:15:52.099 --> 00:15:55.399
Caption: everyone in the company on black anyway

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.520
Caption: that&#39;d be a perfect place to actually

00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.680
Caption: have something like this and initially

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:04.670
Caption: we started looking at just working

00:16:00.679 --> 00:16:05.899
Caption: against the role a slack API which was

00:16:04.669 --> 00:16:08.260
Caption: workable but it&#39;s actually quite

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:10.520
Caption: challenging it was more focused around

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.440
Caption: concepts that were familiar as slack so

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.088
Caption: like messages and streams and sessions

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.349
Caption: and stuff that I didn&#39;t really want to

00:16:14.088 --> 00:16:16.458
Caption: have to think about because they weren&#39;t

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:18.139
Caption: related to the kind of thing that was

00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:20.239
Caption: trying to build so we did that for a

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:23.869
Caption: little bit not you&#39;re getting along okay

00:16:20.239 --> 00:16:25.789
Caption: and then we came across I&#39;m really

00:16:23.869 --> 00:16:27.890
Caption: started to terrible logo and I did look

00:16:25.789 --> 00:16:29.690
Caption: really hard but it&#39;s just shrunken the

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:32.299
Caption: middle is big blocks it&#39;s called Valk

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:33.830
Caption: it&#39;s by high DUI and what they&#39;ve done

00:16:32.299 --> 00:16:34.609
Caption: is they&#39;ve kind of an old abstraction

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.350
Caption: around

00:16:34.609 --> 00:16:37.609
Caption: well the slack interface and then a

00:16:36.349 --> 00:16:39.829
Caption: whole bunch of other ones so basically

00:16:37.609 --> 00:16:40.278
Caption: it&#39;s a chat platform you can use for

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.440
Caption: multiple

00:16:40.278 --> 00:16:44.989
Caption: sorry it&#39;s a chat library you can use

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.220
Caption: from multiple platforms so work great

00:16:44.989 --> 00:16:47.959
Caption: and meant that we can start design our

00:16:46.219 --> 00:16:49.129
Caption: chat in the system and then if we

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.110
Caption: want to move from slack to something

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:53.989
Caption: else a later date we could and it really

00:16:51.109 --> 00:16:55.399
Caption: had the concepts of conversation baked

00:16:53.989 --> 00:16:56.899
Caption: into so you were thinking about how a

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.270
Caption: conversation works rather than try to

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:03.110
Caption: work out mentally how does english

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:04.880
Caption: translate to this black api that goes so

00:17:03.109 --> 00:17:07.429
Caption: far and we actually got a really good

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.500
Caption: start with that but unfortunately just

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:13.040
Caption: for those two your Cana still a little

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.630
Caption: bit limited in terms of the type of

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.338
Caption: interface you could descent design was

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:18.890
Caption: still very much based on keyword or

00:17:16.338 --> 00:17:21.229
Caption: keyphrase initiation so I had to

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.030
Caption: programmatically say use the feedback

00:17:21.229 --> 00:17:25.040
Caption: example I want to leave some feedback it

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:26.750
Caption: was a very specific English string and a

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.130
Caption: few odd men and you know put slight

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:32.030
Caption: variations on that they&#39;re all still

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:33.410
Caption: felt a bit you know it felt very it

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.090
Caption: wasn&#39;t quite what I thought of when I

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.530
Caption: thought I want this thing to understand

00:17:35.089 --> 00:17:37.819
Caption: what I&#39;m saying irrespective of the way

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.520
Caption: I understood

00:17:37.819 --> 00:17:42.769
Caption: so I started exploring natural language

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.479
Caption: processors and Shean learning tools that

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:47.390
Caption: did it and I came across a couple and

00:17:44.479 --> 00:17:49.939
Caption: was actually gobsmacked about how blue

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:52.250
Caption: barrier they work start using these guys

00:17:49.939 --> 00:17:54.949
Caption: Apia are the ones we ended off using in

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.479
Caption: the end yeah I&#39;m going to show you a

00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:59.149
Caption: little bit in a minute but it&#39;s

00:17:56.479 --> 00:18:00.829
Caption: phenomenally simple to use and you get

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:03.650
Caption: really good results with it the other

00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:05.569
Caption: one that I looked at was what a is wate

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:08.210
Caption: I and they were recently acquired by

00:18:05.569 --> 00:18:09.259
Caption: Facebook which can mean Facebook e they

00:18:08.209 --> 00:18:10.939
Caption: are really believe in them or they&#39;re

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.560
Caption: going to just bury them don&#39;t know

00:18:10.939 --> 00:18:14.179
Caption: what&#39;s going to happen there but I

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.190
Caption: offered away from those guys because

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.810
Caption: they seem to want to keep you on

00:18:16.189 --> 00:18:19.159
Caption: platform so you know they wanted to

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.750
Caption: manage the conversation they wanted to

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.489
Caption: know all the details of what you were

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.930
Caption: working on and they kind of have that

00:18:22.489 --> 00:18:25.729
Caption: weird pace with what I know everything

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:28.310
Caption: about your vibe about it I just kind of

00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:30.260
Caption: avoided them but these guys API AI

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:32.390
Caption: really polished documentation is

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:35.540
Caption: excellent and they&#39;re really responsive

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:37.339
Caption: to helping you if you have questions so

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.260
Caption: I&#39;m going to try and show you a quick

00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:40.729
Caption: demo of the various bits and pieces I&#39;m

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.449
Caption: tethered to a phone and I&#39;m hoping that

00:18:40.729 --> 00:18:43.449
Caption: everything works

00:18:45.989 --> 00:18:53.290
Caption: let&#39;s see and then once super-resolution

00:18:48.459 --> 00:18:55.329
Caption: here so probably the first thing to show

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.739
Caption: you if you haven&#39;t seen slacks right and

00:18:55.329 --> 00:19:00.309
Caption: also it&#39;s ridiculous this is the

00:18:56.739 --> 00:19:01.809
Caption: resolution it&#39;s not great but building

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:04.360
Caption: that ball and slacks actually reasonably

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.440
Caption: trivial you can just jump into end if

00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:06.429
Caption: you haven&#39;t go slack at work you can

00:19:05.439 --> 00:19:07.449
Caption: actually just go sign up for slack

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:10.000
Caption: yourself it doesn&#39;t cost you anything

00:19:07.449 --> 00:19:13.059
Caption: this is my personal account that I don&#39;t

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.359
Caption: pay for and it just runs constantly but

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:23.680
Caption: you can jump into there it&#39;s going to be

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:27.390
Caption: here and look at acid integrations be

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:38.140
Caption: this responsive and it&#39;s changed a lot

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:41.550
Caption: when you manage apps where are we so I&#39;m

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:47.099
Caption: not used to the actual am responsive

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:47.100
Caption: Testament addictions no it&#39;s probably

00:19:49.969 --> 00:19:53.329
Caption: yeah yeah the excuse me I&#39;m not familiar

00:19:51.798 --> 00:19:54.439
Caption: with it responsibly and they&#39;re

00:19:53.329 --> 00:19:55.758
Caption: effectively there&#39;s an option says

00:19:54.439 --> 00:19:57.469
Caption: Korean vault and it&#39;s literally that you

00:19:55.759 --> 00:19:58.759
Caption: just create a ball give that name and it

00:19:57.469 --> 00:20:01.638
Caption: gives you an API key that using your

00:19:58.759 --> 00:20:03.229
Caption: program so but once you&#39;re up and

00:20:01.639 --> 00:20:10.489
Caption: running with that and slack you end off

00:20:03.229 --> 00:20:12.668
Caption: with the if you actually get back to

00:20:10.489 --> 00:20:12.668
Caption: there

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:29.360
Caption: a second oh yeah hmm yeah sorry

00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:30.949
Caption: there we go so basically once you create

00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:32.209
Caption: that you end up getting one it&#39;ll

00:20:30.949 --> 00:20:34.609
Caption: disappear here as a character like it

00:20:32.209 --> 00:20:36.020
Caption: would with a regular person I&#39;m not very

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:40.099
Caption: inventive I love Marvel Comics

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:42.260
Caption: so my one&#39;s called Jarvis um and yeah

00:20:40.099 --> 00:20:44.209
Caption: basically that then exists as soon as

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:50.030
Caption: you create it you then take that API key

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:51.319
Caption: and you fire up effectively what is a

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.000
Caption: node service and the way I actually

00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:55.759
Caption: choose to architect this and it&#39;s not

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.260
Caption: quite a particular way where I wanted

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.000
Caption: this bot to do a whole bunch of things I

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.349
Caption: didn&#39;t want to have a bot for you have

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.410
Caption: to excuse the terrible coders hack code

00:21:00.349 --> 00:21:05.299
Caption: so yeah it&#39;s all over the place but yeah

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.349
Caption: I didn&#39;t want this I want this bot to do

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.970
Caption: a lot of different things I didn&#39;t want

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:10.189
Caption: to have a bot for page review you bought

00:21:07.969 --> 00:21:11.209
Caption: for feedback above you know people

00:21:10.189 --> 00:21:12.679
Caption: having to remember which fault they had

00:21:11.209 --> 00:21:14.599
Caption: to speak to so I just want one that you

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.440
Caption: know people could communicate with so I

00:21:14.599 --> 00:21:17.390
Caption: can think about how we&#39;re going to

00:21:15.439 --> 00:21:19.219
Caption: architect it and basically all about

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.540
Caption: does like I said earlier is it collect a

00:21:19.219 --> 00:21:23.239
Caption: bunch of information increasing it and

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.739
Caption: fires against an API so I just organized

00:21:23.239 --> 00:21:27.979
Caption: - such a way that it was a service

00:21:24.739 --> 00:21:30.199
Caption: running node and basically it monitored

00:21:27.979 --> 00:21:32.209
Caption: slack listen for key phrases which was

00:21:30.199 --> 00:21:35.299
Caption: the first Pascal trivia and then fired

00:21:32.209 --> 00:21:37.909
Caption: off in a library and basically triggered

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:40.100
Caption: the API with the information that it

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:42.859
Caption: collected all the stuff is set up on

00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:45.079
Caption: github we&#39;ve we&#39;ve made a open source so

00:21:42.859 --> 00:21:47.270
Caption: I mean it&#39;s not pray as a few hacks but

00:21:45.079 --> 00:21:50.239
Caption: feel free lvl to be a link to it you can

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:51.560
Caption: go play with it yourself but effectively

00:21:50.239 --> 00:21:52.609
Caption: just skipping quickly through the code I

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.680
Caption: don&#39;t want to go through it line by line

00:21:52.609 --> 00:21:56.750
Caption: but you&#39;re just requiring in the bucket

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.280
Caption: and a few other bits and pieces and the

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.550
Caption: important stuff to look out for is

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.570
Caption: spawning up that robot which is here

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.460
Caption: determining the events that you actually

00:22:02.569 --> 00:22:06.319
Caption: want to tap into so in slack as a

00:22:04.459 --> 00:22:08.149
Caption: concept of types of events and the ones

00:22:06.319 --> 00:22:11.509
Caption: I want to look out for direct messages

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:16.760
Caption: direct mention dimensions and then I

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:18.680
Caption: tell it to hear everything and then

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.119
Caption: effectively does a couple of checks the

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.310
Caption: first check is just to make sure that

00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:24.020
Caption: it&#39;s not hearing itself its nature it&#39;s

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.570
Caption: not the ball is talking and it also

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.820
Caption: ignores the right dimensions of

00:22:25.569 --> 00:22:30.099
Caption: direct mention you Bennett wouldn&#39;t pick

00:22:27.819 --> 00:22:32.739
Caption: up on that actions work out none of

00:22:30.099 --> 00:22:34.059
Caption: those two things it scrubs the

00:22:32.739 --> 00:22:35.559
Caption: information a little bit does a few

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.680
Caption: things that you need to do with bot kits

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.900
Caption: but then effectively it will check and

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.060
Caption: see if it has this I&#39;d like to leave

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.140
Caption: some feedback then execute something

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:49.180
Caption: that&#39;s in the library which here&#39;s

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:51.099
Caption: feedback that part in here here&#39;s

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.630
Caption: feedback which we have passing through

00:22:51.099 --> 00:22:54.549
Caption: the controller the ball to the message

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:56.140
Caption: and this is where you actually instigate

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:58.390
Caption: the conversational piece of the Heidi

00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.910
Caption: ball kit so you can actually see bot

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:04.119
Caption: start conversation and then you can see

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:05.020
Caption: a combo don&#39;t say the response so like I

00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:06.849
Caption: say I&#39;m not going to go through this

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.190
Caption: line by line but effectively you get to

00:23:06.849 --> 00:23:11.679
Caption: just the Heidi bot kit is the framework

00:23:09.189 --> 00:23:13.719
Caption: that&#39;s actually used to start maintain

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.100
Caption: and build a conversation and it&#39;s a

00:23:13.719 --> 00:23:17.049
Caption: little bit like writing a choose your

00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:18.549
Caption: own adventure story came that you you

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:21.130
Caption: can&#39;t have to like work out how the

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.170
Caption: story works and that was actually for me

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.160
Caption: very but really interesting because some

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.080
Caption: of the things that you take for granted

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.300
Caption: as a human being in terms of how easily

00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:29.919
Caption: you identify what people are saying turn

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.450
Caption: out to be super hard to get then on

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.359
Caption: codes because it can be so easily

00:23:31.449 --> 00:23:36.130
Caption: misinterpreted but like I say I&#39;ll tweet

00:23:34.359 --> 00:23:39.510
Caption: at the link and you can have a look

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:45.099
Caption: through this code at your own time but

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:49.060
Caption: where&#39;d you go this right here so like I

00:23:45.099 --> 00:23:50.079
Caption: say execute and this was the first pass

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.640
Caption: of it so this is what I was talking

00:23:50.079 --> 00:23:54.429
Caption: about where it was literally just

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:58.859
Caption: matching I&#39;d like to leave some feedback

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:58.860
Caption: so if I actually fire up that guy

00:24:03.189 --> 00:24:08.449
Caption: it&#39;s gone

00:24:04.668 --> 00:24:11.839
Caption: and then I should see it the boss now

00:24:08.449 --> 00:24:12.889
Caption: running and I can say things like hi and

00:24:11.839 --> 00:24:14.298
Caption: that will ignore me because it doesn&#39;t

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:20.839
Caption: know what to do with that and then if I

00:24:14.298 --> 00:24:22.250
Caption: say things like leave some feedback so

00:24:20.839 --> 00:24:26.569
Caption: that&#39;s the exact phrase I&#39;ve got caught

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:27.798
Caption: isn&#39;t the first pass should say no

00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:30.408
Caption: problem let me grab a pen and paper

00:24:27.798 --> 00:24:31.668
Caption: again part of the trick of these ad chat

00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:33.919
Caption: BOTS is try and make them seem really

00:24:31.668 --> 00:24:36.349
Caption: human you got a lot of things which

00:24:33.918 --> 00:24:38.779
Caption: we&#39;ll talk about better the end by by

00:24:36.349 --> 00:24:39.949
Caption: being more human with people that what

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.330
Caption: you what you&#39;re effectively doing here

00:24:39.949 --> 00:24:43.099
Caption: is kicking off with a workflow you&#39;re

00:24:41.329 --> 00:24:44.689
Caption: now engaged in a conversation where you

00:24:43.099 --> 00:24:47.750
Caption: can grab a little bits of information

00:24:44.689 --> 00:24:51.048
Caption: average so you can see all the the still

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:53.418
Caption: names let&#39;s go hungry muscle man me to

00:24:51.048 --> 00:24:58.428
Caption: get laid here and the project was a

00:24:53.418 --> 00:24:59.839
Caption: hackathon and we have something called

00:24:58.428 --> 00:25:08.209
Caption: seek attribute so what they one of the

00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:11.260
Caption: most passion and eCos super angry I&#39;m

00:25:08.209 --> 00:25:14.418
Caption: just in a lie he did it was really scary

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:16.928
Caption: yeah that is one of our DevOps guiding

00:25:14.418 --> 00:25:19.908
Caption: in every one normally does it they yeah

00:25:16.928 --> 00:25:21.109
Caption: anyway done that&#39;s the only way I can

00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:22.429
Caption: think of at the moment determinate

00:25:21.109 --> 00:25:22.908
Caption: conversation that might be smart ways to

00:25:22.428 --> 00:25:25.459
Caption: do that

00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:26.539
Caption: okay ideas received and distinct tell me

00:25:25.459 --> 00:25:28.038
Caption: because I&#39;m not missing network you

00:25:26.538 --> 00:25:29.359
Caption: can&#39;t connect to the API we get I hear

00:25:28.038 --> 00:25:31.250
Caption: it replies up all the information in a

00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:33.199
Caption: conversational style and then post often

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:36.048
Caption: API they see I sent from the back is a

00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:37.880
Caption: great received so this we did a bit of a

00:25:36.048 --> 00:25:39.829
Caption: test some people on you know doing this

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.010
Caption: on the the workplace system versus doing

00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:44.839
Caption: this and overwhelmingly people found us

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:46.729
Caption: like much easier and more inclined to

00:25:44.839 --> 00:25:48.469
Caption: use it the challenges we had with this

00:25:46.729 --> 00:25:49.699
Caption: unfortunately with the work the API

00:25:48.469 --> 00:25:50.869
Caption: didn&#39;t work quite in the way that we

00:25:49.699 --> 00:25:52.428
Caption: thought it did or the documentation

00:25:50.869 --> 00:25:53.959
Caption: suggested so we&#39;ve actually submit a

00:25:52.428 --> 00:25:55.788
Caption: pull request event to fix that and we

00:25:53.959 --> 00:25:58.099
Caption: can actually start integrating it so the

00:25:55.788 --> 00:26:01.099
Caption: moment and or things that happen to

00:25:58.099 --> 00:26:02.418
Caption: leasehold with and the moment we&#39;re just

00:26:01.099 --> 00:26:05.359
Caption: basically sick and an encrypted database

00:26:02.418 --> 00:26:07.479
Caption: need AWS so you can kind of see and we

00:26:05.359 --> 00:26:10.099
Caption: you know we had a similar thing where

00:26:07.479 --> 00:26:11.270
Caption: where you know we can arrange meetings I

00:26:10.099 --> 00:26:12.410
Caption: can stay here like a meeting I&#39;d like

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.180
Caption: these people in it and they come back

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.380
Caption: and what we do is go up in the

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.330
Caption: background and say right I&#39;ve checked

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.770
Caption: your calendar all their calendars and

00:26:17.329 --> 00:26:19.880
Caption: meeting them availability and you&#39;ve got

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.530
Caption: these three options which one would you

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.660
Caption: like and you can say I&#39;ll have that

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:25.430
Caption: meeting room at please and it will just

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.290
Caption: now go back and it&#39;ll organize me and

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:29.390
Caption: you&#39;re getting me in a quest the far

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.590
Caption: less friction and organizing meetings we

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.750
Caption: came across another little niggle there

00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:34.429
Caption: and it&#39;s seek when we staff exchange the

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.780
Caption: just set up some default settings with

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.400
Caption: some things so newbie they are actually

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.770
Caption: defined quite a working day was it seek

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:42.890
Caption: so according to the the seek exchange

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:45.020
Caption: cab timeframe our working day started I

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:47.060
Caption: think it was 1 a.m. and finished it like

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:49.580
Caption: 12 p.m. and a lot this was basically

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:51.260
Caption: twice four hours so you send it off to

00:26:49.579 --> 00:26:52.699
Caption: the ball and it would come back so yeah

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:55.430
Caption: great I find our meeting room like today

00:26:52.699 --> 00:26:57.339
Caption: and we can be a tentacle tonight is that

00:26:55.430 --> 00:27:00.320
Caption: good so we&#39;ve got a few things that

00:26:57.339 --> 00:27:01.729
Caption: we&#39;ve got to fix the underlying systems

00:27:00.319 --> 00:27:04.549
Caption: to support these things which we&#39;re

00:27:01.729 --> 00:27:06.500
Caption: working on as well so that was the first

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:10.400
Caption: part that was kind of the the very you

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:12.319
Caption: know based on key phrase very inflexible

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.849
Caption: and did you know I didn&#39;t think they

00:27:12.319 --> 00:27:15.289
Caption: were gonna get people to use this if you

00:27:13.849 --> 00:27:17.179
Caption: have to know the exact command because I

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:19.400
Caption: just imagine a fire enter and it&#39;s like

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:21.530
Caption: what&#39;s the thing I have to say to Jarvis

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.180
Caption: to make him do this and that&#39;s not why I

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:27.670
Caption: actually wanted so that&#39;s when I started

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:32.270
Caption: looking at these guys and what actually

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:33.320
Caption: if I can I&#39;ll take you through this

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.700
Caption: there&#39;s actually quite a lot to go

00:27:33.319 --> 00:27:38.599
Caption: through in this sort of trying to get to

00:27:34.699 --> 00:27:41.209
Caption: reasonably quickly but the way that this

00:27:38.599 --> 00:27:43.549
Caption: stuff works is basically this I guess

00:27:41.209 --> 00:27:45.890
Caption: three main concepts you have to be

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:50.690
Caption: familiar with its concept of entities

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:53.030
Caption: intense and contexts so with entities

00:27:50.689 --> 00:27:55.039
Caption: that&#39;s kind of anything that you would

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:58.130
Caption: speak about in us our domain sense so

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.840
Caption: one example might be a secret och a lot

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:02.079
Caption: of a production so that might be an

00:27:59.839 --> 00:28:04.099
Caption: essay the people refer to is prod life

00:28:02.079 --> 00:28:05.630
Caption: whatever you know there&#39;s a bunch of

00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:09.160
Caption: things with that&#39;s our entity and you

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.160
Caption: can go in to the entities and

00:28:10.319 --> 00:28:15.539
Caption: define the entities that make sense in

00:28:12.599 --> 00:28:17.099
Caption: your domain so for the feedback 1 you

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.140
Caption: know what you normally do with the bunch

00:28:17.099 --> 00:28:21.329
Caption: of synonyms so for feedback is feedback

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.160
Caption: observation assessment and what you do

00:28:21.329 --> 00:28:26.039
Caption: is you fill up the entities to sort of

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:27.479
Caption: define your environment and then the

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.640
Caption: intents are the way that it actually

00:28:27.479 --> 00:28:31.770
Caption: works out what you&#39;re trying to say so

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:37.109
Caption: when you define an intent with an entity

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:38.700
Caption: you&#39;re basically saying to it you can

00:28:37.109 --> 00:28:44.280
Caption: give it an exact English phrase so I&#39;ll

00:28:38.699 --> 00:28:46.559
Caption: show you up so there&#39;s a feedback one

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.869
Caption: that does a demo so I&#39;d like to give

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.610
Caption: some feedback at feedback feedback so

00:28:48.869 --> 00:28:51.660
Caption: the feedback part there&#39;s the entities I

00:28:50.609 --> 00:28:53.549
Caption: don&#39;t know why I doubled up on the word

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.170
Caption: feedback now this changes quite a lot

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:57.030
Caption: and that&#39;s just come in and since

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:59.820
Caption: yesterday so I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s doing

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:02.430
Caption: that but effectively I&#39;ve defined intent

00:28:59.819 --> 00:29:05.239
Caption: and then I can say things like why else

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:10.369
Caption: would people say this can I give some

00:29:05.239 --> 00:29:10.369
Caption: feedback oh sorry

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:22.800
Caption: are you what they recommend is come up

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:25.859
Caption: with about four or five different ways

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.810
Caption: of seeing the same thing you know and to

00:29:25.859 --> 00:29:29.099
Caption: give you some variety and then what that

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:31.230
Caption: will do in the background is when you

00:29:29.099 --> 00:29:32.459
Caption: send messages to this thing which is

00:29:31.229 --> 00:29:35.250
Caption: reading all the messages and if your

00:29:32.459 --> 00:29:37.619
Caption: direct message it will work out given

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:39.359
Caption: the user sees statements that you&#39;ve

00:29:37.619 --> 00:29:40.800
Caption: provided and the answers provide any

00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:42.750
Caption: sort of combination of that sort of

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:46.940
Caption: thing so if I was to say I&#39;d like to

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:49.829
Caption: give some observation or assessment or

00:29:46.939 --> 00:29:53.309
Caption: you can test it out over this side and

00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:58.829
Caption: say try it now so I&#39;m this one B I&#39;d

00:29:53.310 --> 00:30:00.690
Caption: love to give some feedback and then a

00:29:58.829 --> 00:30:02.130
Caption: workout user says that the speech

00:30:00.689 --> 00:30:03.569
Caption: response is okay so the intent to give

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:05.520
Caption: feedback it works at intent of what

00:30:03.569 --> 00:30:09.469
Caption: you&#39;re trying to say so you can then

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:14.520
Caption: start saying things can I give Andrews

00:30:09.469 --> 00:30:16.409
Caption: some feedback and it&#39;s actually working

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.119
Caption: out in the background you know I think

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:20.369
Caption: to high degree that you&#39;re saying this

00:30:18.119 --> 00:30:21.689
Caption: it gets it&#39;s very goo to actually get

00:30:20.369 --> 00:30:23.640
Caption: the law stuff you got to be careful when

00:30:21.689 --> 00:30:24.929
Caption: you start getting a broader domain and

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.760
Caption: you can start to get the confuse

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:28.680
Caption: depending on how you train it and it

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.140
Caption: also monitors everything that you see to

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.760
Caption: it it can&#39;t satisfying as a history tab

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.320
Caption: that you can go through and say it&#39;ll

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.729
Caption: show you things like they said this and

00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:37.109
Caption: I think they mean that but I didn&#39;t have

00:30:35.729 --> 00:30:38.309
Caption: enough certainty to actually execute

00:30:37.109 --> 00:30:39.390
Caption: that and you can go to and say yeah you

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:42.000
Caption: were right you were right you&#39;re right

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:45.390
Caption: and you can train the drug the vault

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.770
Caption: like that it there&#39;s dragons in there so

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.950
Caption: I mean you&#39;ve got to be really careful

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:52.229
Caption: because it&#39;s really easy screw up and

00:30:48.949 --> 00:30:53.969
Caption: things start getting a bit hairy so like

00:30:52.229 --> 00:30:55.439
Caption: I say I just try it lightly keep up

00:30:53.969 --> 00:30:57.089
Caption: close to me and try and make it specific

00:30:55.439 --> 00:30:58.859
Caption: and try and keep the conversation sharp

00:30:57.089 --> 00:31:05.819
Caption: just until you work out how it&#39;s going

00:30:58.859 --> 00:31:11.369
Caption: so that&#39;s at API oai so everyone with me

00:31:05.819 --> 00:31:14.039
Caption: on that yep good okay so obviously when

00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:17.099
Caption: you wire up the ball I had before just

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:18.210
Caption: got a lot more requires this is actually

00:31:17.099 --> 00:31:19.859
Caption: got some of the ones that we did we did

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:21.689
Caption: stuff with production incidents feedback

00:31:19.859 --> 00:31:22.520
Caption: AWS bookings it was great we were able

00:31:21.689 --> 00:31:24.139
Caption: to go in and say how much

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:25.369
Caption: we spent on AWS this month and I just

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.320
Caption: connected play the built-in came back

00:31:25.369 --> 00:31:30.979
Caption: well you mean by account or do you mean

00:31:27.319 --> 00:31:32.449
Caption: you know ec2 instances so we&#39;re able to

00:31:30.979 --> 00:31:33.829
Caption: do that but the main difference in this

00:31:32.449 --> 00:31:36.799
Caption: one it&#39;s largely the same

00:31:33.829 --> 00:31:38.539
Caption: apart from the fact where this point

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:40.400
Caption: here it sends a request off to the API

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.380
Caption: AI service techs request you just send

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.000
Caption: all and what you actually end up doing

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.619
Caption: is getting back one of those actions

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.630
Caption: that you&#39;ve defined in your intense and

00:31:45.619 --> 00:31:49.040
Caption: then based on the action that you get

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.989
Caption: back you can then channel the

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.600
Caption: conversation and area you want we only

00:31:50.989 --> 00:31:55.459
Caption: did it like first level so we use intent

00:31:53.599 --> 00:31:56.989
Caption: engine and work out how to start a

00:31:55.459 --> 00:31:58.069
Caption: conversation if you want to start

00:31:56.989 --> 00:32:00.170
Caption: getting really clever with it you could

00:31:58.069 --> 00:32:01.789
Caption: have intense being worked out as you go

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:03.440
Caption: along so that you start a conversation

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:05.090
Caption: then you can do this that way another

00:32:03.439 --> 00:32:06.859
Caption: I&#39;d imagine that&#39;s going to start

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:10.039
Caption: getting quite complicated but it&#39;s

00:32:06.859 --> 00:32:11.479
Caption: definitely possible and and one other

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.000
Caption: thing I didn&#39;t touch on sorry on the API

00:32:11.479 --> 00:32:15.589
Caption: AI interface is the notion of context

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.750
Caption: that was something that I kind of

00:32:15.589 --> 00:32:18.890
Caption: learned I guess I&#39;ve been aware of it is

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:21.439
Caption: something specifically learned going

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:23.599
Caption: through this as human beings it&#39;s really

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:26.319
Caption: easy for us to retain context for long

00:32:23.599 --> 00:32:28.699
Caption: periods of time so an example is talk I

00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:30.558
Caption: before every statement I haven&#39;t had to

00:32:28.699 --> 00:32:32.209
Caption: precede it with I&#39;m talking about

00:32:30.558 --> 00:32:34.219
Caption: conversational either because you know I

00:32:32.209 --> 00:32:36.319
Caption: haven&#39;t had to refresh the contact every

00:32:34.219 --> 00:32:39.260
Caption: single time it&#39;s really hard for

00:32:36.319 --> 00:32:41.569
Caption: programming computers to do that so API

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.859
Caption: AI have a concept of context and what

00:32:41.569 --> 00:32:44.899
Caption: you can do is that your intent you can

00:32:42.859 --> 00:32:47.270
Caption: create input context and a good context

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.679
Caption: and I like to do things like care when

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.869
Caption: you&#39;re having a conversation you may say

00:32:48.678 --> 00:32:53.119
Caption: something like at please close the door

00:32:50.869 --> 00:32:54.949
Caption: you know you&#39;re very specific about an

00:32:53.119 --> 00:32:57.020
Caption: entity at the back and you clear intent

00:32:54.949 --> 00:32:58.579
Caption: and they might have an output context of

00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.380
Caption: door you know I&#39;m talking about a door

00:32:58.579 --> 00:33:02.989
Caption: right now so that if you follow that up

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:05.030
Caption: with a falling a statement of please

00:33:02.989 --> 00:33:06.739
Caption: open that it knows well context about a

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.359
Caption: door so I&#39;m alone from the door so

00:33:06.739 --> 00:33:09.469
Caption: context we haven&#39;t played around with

00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:11.000
Caption: too much because they start getting

00:33:09.469 --> 00:33:14.449
Caption: complicated quite quickly it&#39;s in there

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.739
Caption: and you can do it so that&#39;s the intent

00:33:14.449 --> 00:33:18.919
Caption: the contents and the entities are

00:33:15.739 --> 00:33:22.130
Caption: highest level and again this is like I

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:23.510
Caption: say it basically we work out for the

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.920
Caption: response and we get back in action and

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:27.469
Caption: the actions we&#39;re coming back from API

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:28.659
Caption: AI and that determined which path we

00:33:27.469 --> 00:33:35.888
Caption: followed to

00:33:28.659 --> 00:33:41.649
Caption: the rest of the conversation right video

00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:44.249
Caption: game now why do we got okay cool

00:33:41.649 --> 00:33:44.249
Caption: SIL

00:33:48.199 --> 00:33:53.449
Caption: Rory so what I learned along the way and

00:33:50.869 --> 00:33:54.919
Caption: this is quite interesting so getting

00:33:53.449 --> 00:33:55.878
Caption: started a super easy I guess the point

00:33:54.918 --> 00:33:57.108
Caption: you come in and talk to you about this

00:33:55.879 --> 00:33:59.179
Caption: stuff it was really cool it should be

00:33:57.109 --> 00:34:01.969
Caption: fun to play with and like it really it&#39;s

00:33:59.178 --> 00:34:04.308
Caption: all free and it&#39;s really little entry

00:34:01.969 --> 00:34:05.629
Caption: and you kind of get that weird vibe that

00:34:04.308 --> 00:34:07.069
Caption: you had when you pressure or webpages

00:34:05.629 --> 00:34:08.569
Caption: you first started your first app code

00:34:07.069 --> 00:34:11.959
Caption: this was actually something quite cool

00:34:08.569 --> 00:34:13.399
Caption: so you know I&#39;d recommend go and have a

00:34:11.959 --> 00:34:16.338
Caption: look at the stuff that I&#39;ve mentioned

00:34:13.398 --> 00:34:17.838
Caption: today and it does get complicated really

00:34:16.339 --> 00:34:19.309
Caption: quickly I don&#39;t want to undersell it

00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:21.799
Caption: English is a really complicated language

00:34:19.309 --> 00:34:25.069
Caption: to speak and understand so you know

00:34:21.799 --> 00:34:26.178
Caption: doing basic stuff is super easy but you

00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:27.530
Caption: just gotta have a really measured

00:34:26.178 --> 00:34:29.989
Caption: approach therefore my trying to achieve

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:34.369
Caption: here and how am I going to do yeah

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:36.020
Caption: Christian Jones is that everyday um yeah

00:34:34.368 --> 00:34:37.459
Caption: so like I mentioned before humans are

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:39.349
Caption: actually naturally good at we do all the

00:34:37.459 --> 00:34:42.648
Caption: time without even thinking about it like

00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:43.940
Caption: I&#39;m a Scot I see things all the time and

00:34:42.648 --> 00:34:44.780
Caption: I can use this health religion there&#39;s a

00:34:43.939 --> 00:34:46.489
Caption: little bit of squint and they&#39;re

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.928
Caption: mentally processing what I just said and

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.309
Caption: then yeah I know it means this is what

00:34:47.928 --> 00:34:52.040
Caption: we talking about we actually do on the

00:34:49.309 --> 00:34:53.899
Caption: fly all the time so actually programming

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.540
Caption: intention and actually working there

00:34:53.898 --> 00:34:57.558
Caption: again the current is reasonably easy in

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:00.410
Caption: a closed domaine when we&#39;re talking

00:34:57.559 --> 00:35:01.819
Caption: about specific thing but when you add

00:35:00.409 --> 00:35:03.500
Caption: talked about a broad topic you know we

00:35:01.819 --> 00:35:04.640
Caption: could be jumping politics to score it

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:09.739
Caption: actually gets really quite difficult

00:35:04.639 --> 00:35:12.558
Caption: quite hard quite fast story um and I

00:35:09.739 --> 00:35:13.909
Caption: guess the thing that really interested

00:35:12.559 --> 00:35:15.440
Caption: me the most is like going through all

00:35:13.909 --> 00:35:17.929
Caption: this actually at about reading on where

00:35:15.439 --> 00:35:20.000
Caption: current things are in the field of AI

00:35:17.929 --> 00:35:24.260
Caption: and I&#39;ve like really surprised how

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:28.129
Caption: progress they actually were we are

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:29.659
Caption: currently and I guess yeah I can be

00:35:28.129 --> 00:35:32.058
Caption: broadly categorized in the three sort of

00:35:29.659 --> 00:35:34.219
Caption: categories and the first of which was

00:35:32.059 --> 00:35:35.420
Caption: called Ani which is artificial narrow

00:35:34.219 --> 00:35:37.669
Caption: intelligence and that&#39;s we&#39;ve had that

00:35:35.419 --> 00:35:39.409
Caption: for a long time that&#39;s the same thing

00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:40.790
Caption: like how you&#39;re going to Amazon buy a

00:35:39.409 --> 00:35:42.979
Caption: book in the things you&#39;ll like this book

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:44.929
Caption: because you like that book it&#39;s very

00:35:42.979 --> 00:35:46.729
Caption: specific close the main kind of stuff

00:35:44.929 --> 00:35:49.669
Caption: and the next level long from that&#39;s

00:35:46.729 --> 00:35:51.409
Caption: what&#39;s called AGI which is artificial

00:35:49.669 --> 00:35:53.118
Caption: general intelligence and there&#39;s things

00:35:51.409 --> 00:35:53.859
Caption: are moving towards that in the moments

00:35:53.118 --> 00:35:55.719
Caption: and but that&#39;s

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:58.960
Caption: like dumb human AI which I guess gene

00:35:55.719 --> 00:36:01.359
Caption: Watson could almost pass off us and you

00:35:58.959 --> 00:36:03.159
Caption: know we&#39;re some of the reports I read

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.860
Caption: estimate were projected to have that

00:36:03.159 --> 00:36:07.629
Caption: part where daily life as soon as 2020

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:08.920
Caption: the really scary one which is ASI which

00:36:07.629 --> 00:36:12.219
Caption: is our official super intelligence

00:36:08.919 --> 00:36:13.359
Caption: that&#39;s Skynet terminators that&#39;s an

00:36:12.219 --> 00:36:15.189
Caption: artificial intelligence are the

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:18.520
Caption: collective intelligence of every human

00:36:15.189 --> 00:36:19.750
Caption: being ever a lot of people think that

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.820
Caption: you know it&#39;s taken us this long to get

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:23.860
Caption: through Ani and that long to get to AGI

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.930
Caption: that&#39;ll take that long to get to yes

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.640
Caption: I&#39;ve it&#39;s actually an ass curve and the

00:36:25.929 --> 00:36:30.099
Caption: period of time the estimate between AGI

00:36:27.639 --> 00:36:31.929
Caption: and ASI is actually reasonably sharp you

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.460
Caption: know you have intelligent programs going

00:36:31.929 --> 00:36:35.649
Caption: from dumb human to all by are insane in

00:36:33.459 --> 00:36:37.750
Caption: a really short space of time so it&#39;s an

00:36:35.649 --> 00:36:39.299
Caption: interesting field and it&#39;s you know it&#39;s

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:42.370
Caption: cropping up everywhere at the moment

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.170
Caption: people to seek we now have an artificial

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:46.570
Caption: intelligence team that are working on

00:36:44.169 --> 00:36:49.689
Caption: how can we implement this in our more

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:51.550
Caption: appointments and most importantly like

00:36:49.689 --> 00:36:54.189
Caption: I&#39;ve mentioned before it&#39;s really fun

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:55.929
Caption: just have a play around with it see what

00:36:54.189 --> 00:36:57.489
Caption: you think and if you think about the

00:36:55.929 --> 00:37:00.729
Caption: fact that there&#39;s millions of people

00:36:57.489 --> 00:37:02.290
Caption: already on chat platforms and at the

00:37:00.729 --> 00:37:03.639
Caption: moment the potential for this in terms

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:08.320
Caption: of integrating into a lot of people&#39;s

00:37:03.639 --> 00:37:09.789
Caption: lives absolutely huge and yeah this is

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.560
Caption: one last point actually I felt I had to

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:14.439
Caption: mention that conversational use there is

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.400
Caption: a ridiculously hard to debug because if

00:37:14.439 --> 00:37:17.739
Caption: you think about it you&#39;ve actually

00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:19.419
Caption: especially if they&#39;re warm if you have a

00:37:17.739 --> 00:37:20.649
Caption: conversation as many points in it and

00:37:19.419 --> 00:37:22.119
Caption: anything all that not quite right or

00:37:20.649 --> 00:37:23.589
Caption: they&#39;ve done it quite right in this

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.670
Caption: sense of slack you can&#39;t have to make

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.630
Caption: your adjustment and then go through the

00:37:24.669 --> 00:37:27.549
Caption: process of talking through the

00:37:25.629 --> 00:37:28.839
Caption: conversation again I mean that&#39;s how

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.850
Caption: we&#39;re doing at the moment I&#39;m sure the

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.250
Caption: smarter ways of doing it and maybe test

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:35.410
Caption: both to talk to actual bots and I don&#39;t

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:38.290
Caption: know that at the moment it was really

00:37:35.409 --> 00:37:41.349
Caption: bloody painful so yeah we need to look

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:44.410
Caption: at that a little bit I guess where can

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:46.120
Caption: see things going from here and well you

00:37:44.409 --> 00:37:48.039
Caption: know it&#39;s happening already

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.600
Caption: KLM which is the European carrier and

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:51.820
Caption: you can now go into messenger book

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.350
Caption: fights through KLM believe you can order

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:56.340
Caption: Domino pizza through messenger as well

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:58.350
Caption: it&#39;s becoming more prevalent people are

00:37:56.340 --> 00:38:02.070
Caption: embracing this and feeling comfortable

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:03.540
Caption: engaging with machines in this way the

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.400
Caption: interesting part is there&#39;s a bit of a

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.840
Caption: moral debate on whether or not we should

00:38:05.399 --> 00:38:08.760
Caption: be calling out that their actual boss

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.290
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of psychological games

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.729
Caption: when people think that they&#39;re talking

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:13.169
Caption: to human they tend to leak more

00:38:11.729 --> 00:38:14.219
Caption: information where they&#39;re a lot more

00:38:13.169 --> 00:38:17.159
Caption: guarded when they think they&#39;re talking

00:38:14.219 --> 00:38:18.869
Caption: to a machine so in snow do you call I&#39;ll

00:38:17.159 --> 00:38:20.520
Caption: front hi I&#39;m a bot you&#39;re talking about

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.960
Caption: or do you just let them believe it&#39;s

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:25.050
Caption: actually a human being to try and get

00:38:21.959 --> 00:38:26.339
Caption: more information so like after learning

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.780
Caption: what I did I&#39;ve now got this really

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:30.000
Caption: weird uncomfortable feeling whenever I

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:31.500
Caption: talk to a chat service it&#39;s like are you

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.489
Caption: a ball or a person they&#39;re like hahaha

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:38.310
Caption: I&#39;m a person but that&#39;s a ball would say

00:38:34.489 --> 00:38:40.379
Caption: so I am so yeah I usually throw in a

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:43.920
Caption: couple of that you&#39;re in test questions

00:38:40.379 --> 00:38:45.179
Caption: in there and yeah and this is something

00:38:43.919 --> 00:38:46.409
Caption: I think is gonna be really interesting

00:38:45.179 --> 00:38:49.349
Caption: is that psychology is going to be this

00:38:46.409 --> 00:38:50.399
Caption: part as much a part UX design as graphic

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:52.020
Caption: designer as well you know when you look

00:38:50.399 --> 00:38:53.369
Caption: at the fields in your your linguistic

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.350
Caption: programming and the ways that you can

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:57.660
Caption: communicate with people and get them to

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:59.280
Caption: think and act in a certain way if we&#39;re

00:38:57.659 --> 00:39:00.629
Caption: going to have program interfaces that

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.280
Caption: actually communicate with people in that

00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:03.899
Caption: way then it&#39;s very real that

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.939
Caption: psychologists could have an integral

00:39:03.899 --> 00:39:07.919
Caption: part and how to build these interfaces

00:39:05.939 --> 00:39:11.040
Caption: so you de can assess some of the things

00:39:07.919 --> 00:39:12.299
Caption: I think might happen and yeah I mean

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:15.030
Caption: that that&#39;s generally everything I&#39;ve

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:16.410
Caption: got I&#39;m not an expert in this this is

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.090
Caption: just something I play with in my spare

00:39:16.409 --> 00:39:19.379
Caption: time and doing hackathon so happy to try

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.150
Caption: and answer any questions you might have

00:39:19.379 --> 00:39:24.449
Caption: about this or but sea currents and I&#39;ve

00:39:21.149 --> 00:39:26.899
Caption: been doing but yep when you judge the

00:39:24.449 --> 00:39:26.899
Caption: library

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:34.000
Caption: yeah it&#39;s time for an export is just

00:39:29.709 --> 00:39:36.820
Caption: basically ng Savalas dissing that all

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.709
Caption: right there as they&#39;ve got aware of it

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.510
Caption: being a standard intention for my rent I

00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:43.540
Caption: like that was they have their formats

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:44.649
Caption: pretty basic but it changes a lot so it

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.100
Caption: might be something they might come also

00:39:44.649 --> 00:39:51.489
Caption: huh

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:53.739
Caption: yes no I didn&#39;t because they weren&#39;t out

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:55.360
Caption: when I started and I can I gone a lot of

00:39:53.739 --> 00:39:57.669
Caption: it than the past and then I had a brief

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.470
Caption: look at the Microsoft ball kit but it

00:39:57.669 --> 00:40:01.149
Caption: seemed to just be a wrapper around Heidi

00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:02.260
Caption: so we like an attraction of her

00:40:01.149 --> 00:40:10.479
Caption: abstraction I thought well and I&#39;m

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:12.820
Caption: people Heidi so and the mother yes yes

00:40:10.479 --> 00:40:15.070
Caption: yes I do that so that&#39;s where I want to

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:17.440
Caption: take this am because there&#39;s kind of a

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:18.910
Caption: little bit uh I&#39;m not sure how for the

00:40:17.439 --> 00:40:20.530
Caption: morals are around this effectively this

00:40:18.909 --> 00:40:21.789
Caption: ball is monitoring everyone seeks thing

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.800
Caption: all the time so that&#39;s got a bit of a

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:25.090
Caption: creepy vibe till already but I really

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.500
Caption: wanted to be proactive so rather than

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:27.670
Caption: waiting for somebody to say I&#39;d like to

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.290
Caption: give some feedback I&#39;d like it be

00:40:27.669 --> 00:40:30.819
Caption: listening in and say hey sounds like you

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:31.870
Caption: know you guys did an awesome job

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:33.940
Caption: together would you like to give some

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:35.260
Caption: feedback you know you can definitely do

00:40:33.939 --> 00:40:37.179
Caption: that I just haven&#39;t had the chance to

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:44.530
Caption: program I am yeah so yeah they could be

00:40:37.179 --> 00:40:48.129
Caption: like my question around didn&#39;t know yeah

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:49.510
Caption: yeah he&#39;s only in our main flat channel

00:40:48.129 --> 00:40:50.709
Caption: at the moment he&#39;s invited in a couple

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:54.639
Caption: of channels cuz he helps with certain

00:40:50.709 --> 00:40:55.719
Caption: things but um yeah yeah that weird place

00:40:54.639 --> 00:40:56.889
Caption: of that we&#39;re just going to try and feel

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:58.119
Caption: our way through it and see what feels

00:40:56.889 --> 00:40:59.949
Caption: right you know as soon as it starts

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:05.830
Caption: feeling creepy or intrusive we&#39;ll

00:40:59.949 --> 00:41:08.568
Caption: probably back off a little bit yep off

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:11.479
Caption: of the moment zones back yeah

00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:13.849
Caption: what yeah apparently you haven&#39;t tried

00:41:11.479 --> 00:41:15.289
Caption: it but you know as much as probably

00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:16.789
Caption: theory about how an idea access their

00:41:15.289 --> 00:41:18.438
Caption: like it move from different databases

00:41:16.789 --> 00:41:20.239
Caption: that I just read will be some courts

00:41:18.438 --> 00:41:21.139
Caption: with it basically but yeah there&#39;s

00:41:20.239 --> 00:41:22.759
Caption: something some of the stuff that you do

00:41:21.139 --> 00:41:25.909
Caption: in the program that seems very specific

00:41:22.759 --> 00:41:31.789
Caption: to black but how difficult that is to

00:41:25.909 --> 00:41:33.798
Caption: change it I&#39;m sorry have to see

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:36.708
Caption: yeah thinking about things on a broader

00:41:33.799 --> 00:41:38.299
Caption: scale what kind of like meta security

00:41:36.708 --> 00:41:40.519
Caption: implications are there in terms of

00:41:38.299 --> 00:41:42.698
Caption: people opting out from talking to both

00:41:40.519 --> 00:41:45.229
Caption: for not having their information

00:41:42.698 --> 00:41:48.559
Caption: whistles to by a Bob just because we&#39;re

00:41:45.229 --> 00:41:51.259
Caption: on channel like it&#39;s very dilute in that

00:41:48.559 --> 00:41:53.448
Caption: direction yeah so like I say for me that

00:41:51.259 --> 00:41:54.349
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of gray area in there that

00:41:53.448 --> 00:41:55.879
Caption: I think we have to spend a bit of time

00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:58.429
Caption: thinking about and working out what

00:41:55.879 --> 00:42:00.108
Caption: feels right I mean you know I see

00:41:58.428 --> 00:42:01.759
Caption: companies do things like get you

00:42:00.108 --> 00:42:03.438
Caption: familiar with a hot girl product you

00:42:01.759 --> 00:42:06.279
Caption: guys at all hot are the product that you

00:42:03.438 --> 00:42:08.088
Caption: can actually use to monitor your users

00:42:06.279 --> 00:42:09.589
Caption: interactions and ideas gives you a

00:42:08.089 --> 00:42:11.599
Caption: better picture of how people actually

00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:13.279
Caption: interact with your site but it&#39;s also

00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:15.229
Caption: got a bit of Crete where factor to that
