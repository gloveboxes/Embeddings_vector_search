  "description": "Much like software development, life is full of mistakes, mis-steps and broken ambitions; the failed career, burnt toast, the not-quite-what-I-ordered item you bought online. \\n\\nLet\u0027s face it, working in software development is hard and we\u0027ve all been the victim of a failed development project, dissatisfied stakeholders and abandoned half-functional prototypes. And if you\u0027ve ever taken part in the post-mortem retrospective of failed project, you know that sometimes it\u0027s not exactly clear where a project falls down. \\n\\nUsing a series of mistakes from my life, this talk will walk you through identifying three pitfalls that cause failure in software development, and how we can learn to avoid them. \\n\\nNo experience necessary\\n20 mins\\nCore/Non Technical Skills\\nSarah began their career as a Medical Scientist where they explored genetic data before transitioning to the Technology industry. Since then, Sarah has worked in multiple areas including research, incident management, software development, and delivery.\\n\\nThis has sparked their passion in bringing people together and supporting teams to use data to drive the best outcome for customers, stakeholders and business."
