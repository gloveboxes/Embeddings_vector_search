  "description": "Mobile app development has come a long way since it first burst onto the scene. In this talk we\u2019ll look at the lay of the land, focusing largely on the current landscape and the tools which are available to the modern mobile developer.\\n\\nAs developers we currently have many different routes to realise our applications on mobile devices. From native languages, cross platform development tools such as React Native and the new \u201Capp like\u201D, Progressive Web Apps.  We\u2019ll delve into exactly what these differing platforms are, their strengths and weaknesses and in which circumstances each may be appropriate to use.\\n\\nOriginally from Scotland, I moved to Perth 4 years ago to enjoy the much sunnier climate!  Having worked in a variety of programming roles across a wide breadth of industries for nearly 20 years, I finally fell into mobile development in 2011 and never looked back.  I currently work at Adapptor in the Perth CBD who are a mobile focused development team who I\u0027ve been with for a year and a half."
