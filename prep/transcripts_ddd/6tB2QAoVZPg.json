  "description": "A rapid 10x growth in our customer base was wonderful for our company but caused stress on our systems and engineers. Mongo is on fire! Redis is on fire! The network is saturated! These are but a few of the scalability problems we encountered.\\n\\nTime again, how could we have avoided the pain? Can we embed performance-centric practices in our daily routines?\\n\\nPerformance is often a misinterpreted and unloved responsibility of the modern software engineer. Terms like \u201Cpremature optimisation\u201D can discourage us to consider the performance implications of the software we write. Additionally, many higher-level abstractions and tools we use have a less visible performance cost. I won\u2019t mention time pressure nor agile!\\n\\nIn this session, we review performance principles and practices, and how they relate to common (and very real and experienced!) performance issues. I wrap it up by suggesting some simple means to embed performance practices in the daily routine. \\n\\nThe hope is to be blissfully unaware that a performance issue has been avoided through good practices!\\n\\n--\\nI\u0027m an experienced architect, manager, and developer with a passion for developing quality software solutions and teams. I\u0027m particularly interested in high throughput, cost-effective and scalable distributed systems - sometimes it\u0027s a challenge to find the intersection!"
