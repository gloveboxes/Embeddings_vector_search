Caption: tweet out about it later

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:47.079
Caption: I&#39;m Andy underscore Kerr on Twitter so

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:48.840
Caption: if you want to tweet at me about stuff

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.819
Caption: later you can I&#39;m always on Twitter

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.119
Caption: which actually leads me into my talk

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:56.950
Caption: today which is called CSS is awesome and

00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:01.329
Caption: the reason that I want to talk about

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.819
Caption: this is because the other night so I do

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.579
Caption: this thing where it&#39;s late at night and

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.709
Caption: I can&#39;t sleep so I go and Twitter and I

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.779
Caption: have a bit of a rant about something and

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:13.599
Caption: in this case it was about this meme

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:18.548
Caption: which is often used as a way to say

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:21.368
Caption: we&#39;re CSS sauce I think that&#39;s wrong I

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.929
Caption: think this is awesome I think CSS is

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.729
Caption: doing exactly what it should do in this

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.579
Caption: scenario and the reason that I think

00:01:24.728 --> 00:01:30.248
Caption: that is because here what we&#39;re doing is

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.549
Caption: giving a very explicit width and height

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:35.679
Caption: we&#39;re setting a very specific font size

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.890
Caption: and then we&#39;re putting text in it and

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.299
Caption: just expecting that the container and

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.709
Caption: the text is going to work which is

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.799
Caption: stupid we&#39;ve used these magic numbers

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:49.478
Caption: we&#39;ve put content in it and then it

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.869
Caption: overflows so CSS has just gone well dude

00:01:49.478 --> 00:01:53.879
Caption: that&#39;s not going to work

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.650
Caption: I&#39;ll just overflow two out of the

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:57.180
Caption: container you can still read the content

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.489
Caption: you can figure out what you&#39;re going to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.879
Caption: do about it later or you can leave it as

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:05.669
Caption: it is so I&#39;m gonna bit of a ramble about

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:07.470
Caption: why this is great and a whole bunch of

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:09.619
Caption: different things you could do the

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.509
Caption: opportunities that the CSS provides you

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.160
Caption: in order to deal with this or treat it

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:17.279
Caption: differently so what I&#39;m going to do

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.230
Caption: today is tell you about ways that you

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:22.259
Caption: can deal with this problem but also ways

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:23.909
Caption: that you can use CSS to present it in a

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:27.299
Caption: way that best conveys the meaning of

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.389
Caption: your text in this case CSS is awesome

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.370
Caption: and the very specific reason why I&#39;m

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:35.369
Caption: doing this is that I was asked to talk

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:39.000
Caption: about all the cool things in CSS and I

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:41.069
Caption: went oh how long have you got because

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.889
Caption: there&#39;s heaps of cool things so I&#39;ve

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.738
Caption: picked some I think some of my favorites

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:50.850
Caption: some new some old and hopefully you&#39;ll

00:02:46.738 --> 00:02:52.860
Caption: learn something today so this is really

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.630
Caption: boring I&#39;m really obvious you could

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.570
Caption: solve this problem by setting the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.919
Caption: container which is the oh there&#39;s my

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:04.230
Caption: thing the box to overflow:hidden really

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:07.789
Caption: simple problem solve doesn&#39;t overflow I

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:11.419
Caption: think this is shitty mainly because you

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:16.349
Caption: can&#39;t read the word this is way better

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:18.419
Caption: again CSS awesome but another option

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.700
Caption: that you can do is use the overflow

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:23.220
Caption: property with the value of hidden on the

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:27.179
Caption: h1 and you can add a text overflow of

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.040
Caption: ellipsis this is okay in some scenarios

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:30.569
Caption: like if you&#39;ve got a summary or

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.458
Caption: something like that and you&#39;re linking

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.440
Caption: off to get more information but in this

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:37.018
Caption: particular case I think it&#39;s a really

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.798
Caption: bad implementation because this is

00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:42.690
Caption: really prominent text and that all could

00:03:40.798 --> 00:03:46.789
Caption: literally say anything you could say

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:50.330
Caption: awkward because a CSS is awful could say

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:53.269
Caption: CSS is what&#39;s another all word

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.380
Caption: as far away away CSIS is away I like

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.250
Caption: that one that&#39;s good one I would never

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.480
Caption: thought of that

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.470
Caption: so you&#39;ve got to pick the right context

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.479
Caption: for the content that you&#39;re trying to

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.270
Caption: display the other reason why I really

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:08.779
Caption: really hate this example is because of

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:13.730
Caption: stuff like this I bet you can&#39;t guess

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:15.889
Caption: what this word is pedals

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:18.169
Caption: I do love poodles I don&#39;t have a poodle

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.529
Caption: I haven&#39;t gone retriever but my life is

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.000
Caption: about picking up dog poo at the moment

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:25.070
Caption: but that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s really bad

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.470
Caption: because this can happen a lot you can

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.339
Caption: you can kind of see how you can get

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.299
Caption: yourself into a bit of an awkward

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:34.459
Caption: situation with words when you start

00:04:31.299 --> 00:04:37.339
Caption: chopping it off concatenate in it I&#39;m

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:38.479
Caption: not concatenate truncating it so you&#39;re

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:41.029
Caption: going to be really careful with the

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.430
Caption: things that you choose in this case now

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:44.899
Caption: another thing that you might probably

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:47.720
Caption: didn&#39;t notice but I noticed immediately

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:49.820
Caption: when I did this is that the text doesn&#39;t

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.480
Caption: fit perfectly in the box vertically

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.919
Caption: anymore because it&#39;s not on three lines

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.290
Caption: and one of the things that CSS gets a

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.110
Caption: lot of grief over its not being able to

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.700
Caption: vertically center but there&#39;s actually a

00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:04.759
Caption: lot of ways you can vertically center in

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.300
Caption: CSS you can use transforms you can use

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.839
Caption: positioning way back in the day you

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:14.629
Caption: could use tables but the best way to

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:17.720
Caption: vertically Center in CSS now is with

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.360
Caption: Flex bugs and it&#39;s really really easy

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.440
Caption: it&#39;s literally these two lines of CSS on

00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:27.979
Caption: the the box so we said display of flex

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.279
Caption: and a line items property with a value

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.080
Caption: of center and that&#39;s it

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:36.980
Caption: problem solved not a problem anymore

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:38.569
Caption: CSS is awesome but there is a couple of

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.800
Caption: things you should know and this is what

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.429
Caption: I think the most important thing about

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:46.129
Caption: flex box to understand is it has a cross

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:48.500
Caption: axis on a main axis and this depends on

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.639
Caption: the direction that you apply to the Flex

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.309
Caption: item so in this case and by default

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.848
Caption: flexbox adds a flex direction of row

00:05:55.309 --> 00:06:02.029
Caption: which means everything goes horizontally

00:05:57.848 --> 00:06:04.519
Caption: so it&#39;s got a horizontal main axis and a

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:07.669
Caption: vertical cross access now because I want

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:12.289
Caption: to align vertically here I have to use

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:14.119
Caption: the align group of properties and that&#39;s

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:18.619
Caption: because a line is associated with the

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:21.378
Caption: cross axis if I change this to a flex

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:24.049
Caption: direction of column it switches the

00:06:21.378 --> 00:06:28.609
Caption: cross axis and the main axis so the main

00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:30.589
Caption: axis is now the vertical axis and this

00:06:28.609 --> 00:06:32.478
Caption: means that if I want a vertically Center

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:36.528
Caption: I have to use the justified group of

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:38.839
Caption: properties so justify items to Center if

00:06:36.528 --> 00:06:41.119
Caption: you can wrap your head around this flex

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:42.589
Caption: box is really easy because that&#39;s the

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:46.309
Caption: thing that a lot of people get hung up

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:49.188
Caption: on that do I use a line or do allies use

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:52.039
Caption: justify which one is which and they

00:06:49.188 --> 00:06:54.109
Caption: couldn&#39;t do it you know it justifies

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.089
Caption: always horizontal because you&#39;re

00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:59.718
Caption: changing the meaning by changing the

00:06:56.089 --> 00:07:01.968
Caption: direction from a row to a column but

00:06:59.718 --> 00:07:04.459
Caption: flex locks gives us a lot of ways to

00:07:01.968 --> 00:07:08.359
Caption: vertically Center or to align content

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:11.539
Caption: within the div you can use space between

00:07:08.359 --> 00:07:14.809
Caption: which evenly distribute space in the

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:17.209
Caption: middle of items there&#39;s also a property

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:20.509
Caption: called space around which puts an even

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:22.878
Caption: amount of space around each item my

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:24.739
Caption: favorite is flex end which puts

00:07:22.878 --> 00:07:27.378
Caption: everything at the end um it&#39;s really

00:07:24.739 --> 00:07:29.088
Caption: straightforward really easy and you have

00:07:27.378 --> 00:07:33.109
Caption: a lot of control where how you want to

00:07:29.088 --> 00:07:36.319
Caption: align your content and CSS and flex box

00:07:33.109 --> 00:07:39.049
Caption: works really awesome with CSS grid which

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:44.359
Caption: is new and it is supported in all the

00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:47.989
Caption: major browsers now not in IE but it&#39;s

00:07:44.359 --> 00:07:49.718
Caption: fine there are a lot of really good

00:07:47.989 --> 00:07:51.829
Caption: resources for doing for backs for grid

00:07:49.718 --> 00:07:54.169
Caption: Rachel Andrew Jenn Simmons

00:07:51.829 --> 00:07:56.809
Caption: you know Kravitz they&#39;ve all got awesome

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:58.290
Caption: things it&#39;s not hard I&#39;ve done it&#39;s

00:07:56.809 --> 00:08:00.959
Caption: really easy

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:03.720
Caption: now I can&#39;t go through everything with

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:05.759
Caption: grid because that would be like an hour

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:09.119
Caption: of awesome and I wouldn&#39;t want to

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.309
Caption: overload you but what I will do is just

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:13.829
Caption: give you a really simple example of how

00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:16.500
Caption: powerful CSS is and how powerful the

00:08:13.829 --> 00:08:21.629
Caption: grid spec is now if you look at this

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:22.829
Caption: example I&#39;ve got here eight boxes that

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.110
Caption: say CSS is awesome

00:08:22.829 --> 00:08:27.869
Caption: because I want everyone to know how

00:08:25.109 --> 00:08:30.599
Caption: awesome CSS is and around that is a

00:08:27.869 --> 00:08:35.279
Caption: container and on that container I add

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:38.609
Caption: display grid and that&#39;s going to say use

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.590
Caption: the grid spec now because I want to have

00:08:38.609 --> 00:08:44.549
Caption: spacing between each one I&#39;ve got a grid

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:46.770
Caption: gap of 20 pixels and then what I need to

00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:50.130
Caption: do is tell it how I want the content to

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:53.880
Caption: be distributed so first up is setting up

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:56.010
Caption: the columns which I&#39;ve got for off I use

00:08:53.880 --> 00:09:00.299
Caption: a property called grid template columns

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:02.520
Caption: and on this I&#39;m going to use the repeat

00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:06.119
Caption: function the reason I&#39;m doing this is

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.800
Caption: partly because I&#39;m lazy but also because

00:09:06.119 --> 00:09:10.380
Caption: it just works as I&#39;ve got an unknown

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:12.989
Caption: amount of CSS is awesome because you can

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:16.169
Caption: never have too many and the way that

00:09:12.989 --> 00:09:21.479
Caption: this works with autofill is it says I

00:09:16.169 --> 00:09:25.769
Caption: want to fit as many of these items along

00:09:21.479 --> 00:09:29.010
Caption: my track as long as the size is a

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:31.619
Caption: minimum of 200 80 pixels at a maximum of

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:35.220
Caption: one fraction and what one fraction

00:09:31.619 --> 00:09:36.750
Caption: essentially means is so fraction units

00:09:35.219 --> 00:09:39.479
Caption: basically mean one fraction of the

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.520
Caption: available space so I&#39;m going to show you

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:45.449
Caption: what this looks like because it&#39;s easier

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:49.920
Caption: to to show but basically what this is

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:53.040
Caption: doing is as it scales it says well I can

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:56.820
Caption: fit three or four or one box at a

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:58.649
Caption: minimum size of 280 pixels and then it

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.910
Caption: uses the fraction unit to just scale

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.910
Caption: that out

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:09.410
Caption: and what I love about this is that

00:10:06.969 --> 00:10:12.379
Caption: that&#39;s done with these four lines of CSS

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:17.500
Caption: there&#39;s no media queries it just works

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:20.929
Caption: there&#39;s no this not very complicated

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:23.840
Caption: HTML it&#39;s a container with all the divs

00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:26.989
Caption: inside of it and if you were to recreate

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.460
Caption: this with floats or even flexbox

00:10:26.989 --> 00:10:30.859
Caption: you&#39;ll be finding you&#39;re writing a lot

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:33.170
Caption: of CSS with a lot of media queries and a

00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:35.539
Caption: lot of HTML to try and get something

00:10:33.169 --> 00:10:38.510
Caption: like this to work so grid actually makes

00:10:35.539 --> 00:10:41.269
Caption: our code simpler which means if you&#39;re

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:43.369
Caption: building large JavaScript web apps like

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.470
Caption: I&#39;m doing at the moment your bundle size

00:10:43.369 --> 00:10:47.659
Caption: is huge because you&#39;ve got all this CSS

00:10:45.469 --> 00:10:51.049
Caption: and all this HTML in order to create a

00:10:47.659 --> 00:10:52.579
Caption: layout like this so CSS grid is really

00:10:51.049 --> 00:10:57.200
Caption: awesome and really powerful and it lets

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:59.299
Caption: us do a lot of things in particular what

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.400
Caption: CSS grid allows us to do is start making

00:10:59.299 --> 00:11:03.109
Caption: sort of magazine type layouts and

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.690
Caption: another thing that you see in magazine

00:11:03.109 --> 00:11:09.049
Caption: type layouts is text wrapping around

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:11.239
Caption: images or around containers and this is

00:11:09.049 --> 00:11:16.159
Caption: something that you can do in CSS in

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:18.219
Caption: chrome just Chrome at the moment it is

00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:20.959
Caption: coming in Firefox in August

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:23.539
Caption: apparently so that&#39;s pretty cool and

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.520
Caption: it&#39;s called CSS shapes and the way CSS

00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:29.599
Caption: shapes works is it lets you define a

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:32.390
Caption: shape in CSS with either a polygon or a

00:11:29.599 --> 00:11:36.109
Caption: circle something like that and then the

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:37.369
Caption: text wraps around it so here if right at

00:11:36.109 --> 00:11:39.739
Caption: the bottom there there&#39;s a property

00:11:37.369 --> 00:11:42.739
Caption: called shape - outside and what that

00:11:39.739 --> 00:11:45.080
Caption: means is on my shape inside my container

00:11:42.739 --> 00:11:47.479
Caption: I&#39;m gonna put some CSS in there and

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:51.400
Caption: define the shape that I want the text to

00:11:47.479 --> 00:11:54.019
Caption: wrap around so I picked a triangle

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.059
Caption: because I know no reason in particular I

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.010
Caption: just thought it was cool and the way

00:11:56.059 --> 00:12:00.260
Caption: that you define is with polygons is you

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.869
Caption: set up the coordinates and this

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.440
Caption: essentially I&#39;m going to come over here

00:12:02.869 --> 00:12:08.119
Caption: so like I&#39;m not giving you guys any love

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.419
Caption: so over here we&#39;ve got three coordinates

00:12:08.119 --> 00:12:14.429
Caption: for each point of the try

00:12:09.419 --> 00:12:18.329
Caption: zero zero is the top left zero 100 is

00:12:14.429 --> 00:12:20.609
Caption: the bottom left and then 50 50 is the

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.410
Caption: point in here and you can create any

00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:26.219
Caption: shape that you want with a polygon you

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:28.440
Caption: can put 30 points 100 points whatever

00:12:26.219 --> 00:12:30.479
Caption: you want and that&#39;ll just mean that the

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:34.409
Caption: tax wraps around what&#39;s really important

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:36.750
Caption: about this though is the float yeah you

00:12:34.409 --> 00:12:37.859
Caption: still use floats and CSS I know people

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.239
Caption: think you don&#39;t need to learn about them

00:12:37.859 --> 00:12:41.820
Caption: anymore but they&#39;re wrong

00:12:39.239 --> 00:12:43.289
Caption: floats are still really awesome finally

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:48.239
Caption: we&#39;re going to use floats for what

00:12:43.289 --> 00:12:50.070
Caption: they&#39;re meant for floating things so do

00:12:48.239 --> 00:12:52.679
Caption: figure out 1/2 weeks work don&#39;t ignore

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:54.150
Caption: it they&#39;re really important and you can

00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:57.719
Caption: float it left or you can float it right

00:12:54.150 --> 00:13:02.040
Caption: because that&#39;s what floats to just

00:12:57.719 --> 00:13:04.319
Caption: quickly though importantly to note the

00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:06.059
Caption: syntax does vary for the shape depending

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.640
Caption: on what kind of thing you want to do so

00:13:06.059 --> 00:13:11.820
Caption: if you wanted a circle rather than

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.799
Caption: putting like a thousand points to get a

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.169
Caption: really nice circle you can use the

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:18.119
Caption: circle syntax are you just to find a

00:13:16.169 --> 00:13:21.500
Caption: radius and again a coordinate of where

00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:25.020
Caption: you want it to set sorry in this case

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:27.630
Caption: 50% and that is my radius and then the

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:30.540
Caption: circle just goes around here I gotta

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:34.320
Caption: come over here and show you two over

00:13:30.539 --> 00:13:36.809
Caption: here so I&#39;ve given it a radius of 50

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.780
Caption: percent of the container and then

00:13:36.809 --> 00:13:41.799
Caption: positioned it at 50% so let&#39;s apply that

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:44.500
Caption: so

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:46.539
Caption: this syntax is the same for clip path

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.588
Caption: which is another property but I&#39;m not

00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:51.489
Caption: going to talk about that because I had

00:13:47.588 --> 00:13:55.268
Caption: to cut it I&#39;m afraid I talk too much

00:13:51.489 --> 00:13:56.289
Caption: now one of the most obvious things that

00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:58.328
Caption: I didn&#39;t talk about right at the very

00:13:56.289 --> 00:13:59.799
Caption: beginning was that you could just remove

00:13:58.328 --> 00:14:02.708
Caption: the width and height from the box and

00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:04.778
Caption: everything we&#39;re just like sometimes

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:07.049
Caption: removing things is actually the way to

00:14:04.778 --> 00:14:09.958
Caption: go but there&#39;s still a problem with this

00:14:07.049 --> 00:14:14.648
Caption: and that&#39;s because I&#39;ve still got that

00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:18.369
Caption: done fixed font size which i think is 45

00:14:14.648 --> 00:14:20.648
Caption: pixels from memory and you can see when

00:14:18.369 --> 00:14:23.969
Caption: it gets smaller the text gets cut off

00:14:20.648 --> 00:14:26.229
Caption: again which I&#39;m really not a fan on so

00:14:23.969 --> 00:14:28.929
Caption: the next thing I wanted to talk about is

00:14:26.229 --> 00:14:31.179
Caption: viewport units and they&#39;re actually

00:14:28.929 --> 00:14:35.039
Caption: pretty well supportive all the new

00:14:31.179 --> 00:14:39.518
Caption: browsers support it and back to ie 9

00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:40.630
Caption: partial support so what I&#39;m going to

00:14:39.518 --> 00:14:42.159
Caption: apply to this and I&#39;m going to show you

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:46.630
Caption: how it works before I explain what they

00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:49.989
Caption: are I&#39;m using a viewport width unit and

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:54.309
Caption: it&#39;ll just scale perfectly with the

00:14:49.989 --> 00:15:00.909
Caption: viewport just like that really really

00:14:54.309 --> 00:15:03.630
Caption: smoothly and yeah yeah and the way that

00:15:00.909 --> 00:15:07.088
Caption: our viewport units work is essentially

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:08.950
Caption: they&#39;re a percentage of the viewport so

00:15:07.088 --> 00:15:11.500
Caption: there&#39;s a viewport width and that&#39;s one

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.989
Caption: percent of the viewport width there&#39;s a

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:17.940
Caption: report hype one percent of the viewport

00:15:13.989 --> 00:15:21.190
Caption: height and then there&#39;s V min and V mass

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:23.109
Caption: V min is essentially it&#39;ll take either

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:26.919
Caption: the viewport width or the viewport

00:15:23.109 --> 00:15:29.948
Caption: height whichever is smaller and then V

00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:32.739
Caption: Max will take viewport width viewport

00:15:29.948 --> 00:15:35.198
Caption: height whichever is larger and they&#39;re

00:15:32.739 --> 00:15:38.528
Caption: really awesome for controlling the way

00:15:35.198 --> 00:15:40.059
Caption: that you want your text or widths or

00:15:38.528 --> 00:15:43.059
Caption: anything to scale according to the

00:15:40.059 --> 00:15:45.458
Caption: viewport what&#39;s really great about these

00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:48.528
Caption: is people like Mike Wright Muller have

00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:51.799
Caption: created fairly complex

00:15:48.528 --> 00:15:54.138
Caption: have sass functions to create fluid

00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:55.998
Caption: typography on the web that will just

00:15:54.138 --> 00:15:58.609
Caption: scale and work in every browser with

00:15:55.999 --> 00:16:00.139
Caption: minimum and maximum values they&#39;re

00:15:58.609 --> 00:16:02.059
Caption: really really awesome and I use them all

00:16:00.138 --> 00:16:03.498
Caption: the time especially in code pen where

00:16:02.059 --> 00:16:06.109
Caption: I&#39;m being lazy and want to make a

00:16:03.499 --> 00:16:09.410
Caption: responsive like text effect and don&#39;t

00:16:06.109 --> 00:16:11.119
Caption: want to write media queries so they&#39;re

00:16:09.409 --> 00:16:13.099
Caption: pretty great I really ladies highly

00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:19.278
Caption: recommend you use them again like I said

00:16:13.099 --> 00:16:20.838
Caption: really good support I would be very sad

00:16:19.278 --> 00:16:23.208
Caption: if I talked about fonts and didn&#39;t talk

00:16:20.838 --> 00:16:24.588
Caption: about variable fonts cuz they&#39;re like my

00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:25.909
Caption: favorite thing if you follow me on

00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:29.289
Caption: Twitter this was another one of my

00:16:25.909 --> 00:16:34.159
Caption: Twitter rants recently which actually

00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:36.469
Caption: went really well I I got to spend on my

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:39.708
Caption: Twitter about this rant but a variable

00:16:36.469 --> 00:16:42.409
Caption: fun is it&#39;s a little bit of a stretch it

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:45.948
Caption: is CSS but it&#39;s mainly about the font

00:16:42.409 --> 00:16:48.109
Caption: because what a variable font does and

00:16:45.948 --> 00:16:52.429
Caption: this is a new aspect it&#39;s supported in

00:16:48.109 --> 00:16:56.508
Caption: Chrome Safari and just today edge which

00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:58.278
Caption: is awesome Firefox is like tweeting

00:16:56.508 --> 00:17:00.619
Caption: going yeah yeah we&#39;ll have it soon so

00:16:58.278 --> 00:17:02.809
Caption: it&#39;s you know pretty cool anyway a

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:06.828
Caption: variable fun is essentially one font

00:17:02.809 --> 00:17:08.899
Caption: that acts like multiple fonts so where

00:17:06.828 --> 00:17:12.048
Caption: you have a bold and italic and a

00:17:08.899 --> 00:17:14.088
Caption: condensed font as multiple individual

00:17:12.048 --> 00:17:17.000
Caption: files a variable font is one file that

00:17:14.088 --> 00:17:19.520
Caption: contains all of that information and

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.739
Caption: what&#39;s really awesome about this there&#39;s

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.299
Caption: so many things firstly performance is

00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:25.250
Caption: much better because we&#39;re not blocking

00:17:23.298 --> 00:17:28.458
Caption: the rendering of our page by loading

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:31.939
Caption: multiple fronts we only need one easy

00:17:28.458 --> 00:17:33.979
Caption: the other thing is typically these fonts

00:17:31.939 --> 00:17:35.989
Caption: are smaller than the individual fonts

00:17:33.979 --> 00:17:39.260
Caption: combined so that&#39;s about our four point

00:17:35.989 --> 00:17:42.678
Caption: performance as well and the third thing

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:45.199
Caption: that I love about it is variable fun to

00:17:42.678 --> 00:17:48.709
Caption: have built-in interpolation so if you

00:17:45.199 --> 00:17:51.288
Caption: have a thin weight like what I&#39;d use for

00:17:48.709 --> 00:17:53.719
Caption: CSS and a thick weight

00:17:51.288 --> 00:17:55.129
Caption: like I&#39;ve used for awesome you can

00:17:53.719 --> 00:17:57.949
Caption: actually animate this

00:17:55.130 --> 00:18:00.709
Caption: so you can go from thin to thick without

00:17:57.949 --> 00:18:05.119
Caption: having janky fonts switching out or

00:18:00.709 --> 00:18:08.359
Caption: anything like that because the font from

00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:11.209
Caption: start to finish will interpolate all of

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:14.089
Caption: those values which also means that while

00:18:11.209 --> 00:18:17.469
Caption: now we&#39;re restricted to 400 weight and

00:18:14.089 --> 00:18:20.029
Caption: it like a thin and a bold we can have

00:18:17.469 --> 00:18:22.668
Caption: anything along that axis of

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:24.049
Caption: interpolation which i think is really

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:25.939
Caption: cool and I will show you well that&#39;s

00:18:24.048 --> 00:18:27.678
Caption: cool in a minute but first of all I&#39;m

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:31.788
Caption: going to show you how it works with the

00:18:27.678 --> 00:18:35.239
Caption: CSS so the first thing I didn&#39;t come

00:18:31.788 --> 00:18:36.259
Caption: over this side you just set up your font

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:39.349
Caption: so on the h1

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:41.539
Caption: this one&#39;s called Dunbar and then you

00:18:39.349 --> 00:18:45.918
Caption: use this fun variation settings property

00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:48.918
Caption: and what you do in this is you set our

00:18:45.918 --> 00:18:51.339
Caption: you you have to reference the named

00:18:48.918 --> 00:18:52.788
Caption: access so because they can have multiple

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:56.058
Caption: styles in it

00:18:52.788 --> 00:18:59.658
Caption: this is using weight which is predefined

00:18:56.058 --> 00:19:01.399
Caption: and this one here is at height which

00:18:59.659 --> 00:19:04.429
Caption: actually refers to the height of these

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.669
Caption: letters so you see the S is actually a

00:19:04.428 --> 00:19:09.908
Caption: different height in all of these words

00:19:06.668 --> 00:19:15.168
Caption: and all you have to do is pick a value

00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:20.870
Caption: along the range so the h1 is actually

00:19:15.168 --> 00:19:26.509
Caption: awesome yeah that&#39;s cool which is 178

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:30.770
Caption: weight there is is this one here which

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:31.880
Caption: is 89 yeah 89 weight we&#39;ve liked really

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.770
Caption: random decimal places

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.030
Caption: which I actually put in so you can see

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.429
Caption: that you can literally pick any value

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:39.349
Caption: along the axis and it will it will let

00:19:37.428 --> 00:19:42.048
Caption: you do that and then the way in that

00:19:39.349 --> 00:19:43.609
Caption: this one is 50 as a weight and then I

00:19:42.048 --> 00:19:48.219
Caption: did the same with the x height that&#39;s

00:19:43.609 --> 00:19:50.750
Caption: all one font just holding with CSS so

00:19:48.219 --> 00:19:53.538
Caption: it&#39;s really cool

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:55.159
Caption: this is probably my most popular thing

00:19:53.538 --> 00:19:57.829
Caption: that I&#39;ve ever made in my life it&#39;s my

00:19:55.159 --> 00:20:00.289
Caption: contribution to through the web and it&#39;s

00:19:57.829 --> 00:20:03.739
Caption: growing grass text which I made with a

00:20:00.288 --> 00:20:06.408
Caption: variable font called deep river and blue

00:20:03.739 --> 00:20:07.819
Caption: some people&#39;s minds because no one has

00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:10.100
Caption: ever enema animated tech like that

00:20:07.819 --> 00:20:11.750
Caption: before so with with actual text and

00:20:10.099 --> 00:20:13.069
Caption: that&#39;s editable you can change that to

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.650
Caption: whatever text you want it to be and

00:20:13.069 --> 00:20:19.609
Caption: it&#39;ll still work which is pretty cool

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:22.099
Caption: and I actually cheated with this and

00:20:19.609 --> 00:20:24.158
Caption: combined things in a way I wasn&#39;t

00:20:22.099 --> 00:20:26.538
Caption: supposed to do to make the leaves but

00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:28.640
Caption: it&#39;s pretty cool of what you can do you

00:20:26.538 --> 00:20:34.399
Caption: create a whole new effect with variable

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:35.959
Caption: fronts so moving swiftly on because I&#39;d

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.710
Caption: literally talk about variable fonts all

00:20:35.959 --> 00:20:41.739
Caption: day

00:20:36.709 --> 00:20:44.418
Caption: that&#39;s a cool I want to talk about other

00:20:41.739 --> 00:20:47.178
Caption: text related things because I make a lot

00:20:44.418 --> 00:20:48.918
Caption: of text effects on code pen and I want

00:20:47.178 --> 00:20:50.149
Caption: to talk about first letter because I

00:20:48.918 --> 00:20:52.158
Caption: don&#39;t think it&#39;s used enough it&#39;s

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.599
Caption: something you see in print a lot and

00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:56.690
Caption: people don&#39;t use it enough on the web

00:20:53.599 --> 00:20:59.599
Caption: for my liking it&#39;s really really simple

00:20:56.689 --> 00:21:02.149
Caption: I target my h1 with a pseudo element

00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:05.089
Caption: called first let up using the double

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:08.539
Caption: colon and then I just put whatever stars

00:21:05.089 --> 00:21:11.449
Caption: I want in there so I have cheated a

00:21:08.538 --> 00:21:13.428
Caption: little bit with this CSS the really

00:21:11.449 --> 00:21:18.048
Caption: basic version of this is they set a font

00:21:13.428 --> 00:21:19.428
Caption: size a fun family called facha a font

00:21:18.048 --> 00:21:23.658
Caption: weight that because I don&#39;t want it to

00:21:19.428 --> 00:21:25.399
Caption: be super ball and a color now obviously

00:21:23.659 --> 00:21:28.460
Caption: that&#39;s not how you get this beautiful

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.140
Caption: layered 3d text I did cheat a bit this

00:21:28.459 --> 00:21:34.069
Caption: has two pseudo elements on it as well

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:35.630
Caption: which I&#39;ve used to layer the same font

00:21:34.069 --> 00:21:38.149
Caption: because it&#39;s especially fun to lay a

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:40.880
Caption: font and then I&#39;ve just changed the

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:43.429
Caption: colors of it which is another thing that

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.020
Caption: you can do with variable fonts if you

00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:47.449
Caption: want to see how this is made I literally

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:50.229
Caption: have about a hundred using this example

00:21:47.449 --> 00:21:50.229
Caption: on my code pen

00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:56.159
Caption: now for a more practical sense something

00:21:53.760 --> 00:22:01.349
Caption: like text-decoration skip is really

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:03.420
Caption: awesome so you may not have noticed but

00:22:01.349 --> 00:22:06.270
Caption: when you use a standard underline on the

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:08.130
Caption: web the text goes the underline goes

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:11.839
Caption: straight through the descender which is

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:15.569
Caption: this little bit on the P text decoration

00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:19.279
Caption: skip with a value of ink we&#39;ll skip that

00:22:15.569 --> 00:22:22.559
Caption: and put this nice like space in between

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:25.080
Caption: now this is great because firstly it

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:28.430
Caption: looks nice but as my friend Julie

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:31.760
Caption: pointed out in her presentation recently

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:34.500
Caption: it&#39;s really good for accessibility

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.930
Caption: people with dyslexia might have trouble

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.640
Caption: reading text if you&#39;ve got lines through

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.130
Caption: it so it&#39;s really good accessibility

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:44.130
Caption: feature as well as a nice sort of visual

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:46.260
Caption: tweak to your designs and to your to

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:48.869
Caption: your page the other thing I&#39;ve added on

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:52.109
Caption: here is you can actually color the

00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:53.969
Caption: underline it doesn&#39;t have to be blue or

00:22:52.109 --> 00:22:57.150
Caption: whatever color you set your that link to

00:22:53.969 --> 00:22:59.309
Caption: I&#39;ve used text decoration color and I&#39;ve

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:03.930
Caption: picked my favorite name to color Rebecca

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:05.610
Caption: purple purple is my favorite color but

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.770
Caption: the other thing that you can do is you

00:23:05.609 --> 00:23:09.479
Caption: can actually put over lines on your text

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.700
Caption: as well and you can have an over line

00:23:09.479 --> 00:23:13.890
Caption: and an underline and you do this by just

00:23:11.699 --> 00:23:17.219
Caption: specifying the property text decoration

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:20.219
Caption: line and you just go over line space

00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:22.140
Caption: underline if you want to you can have

00:23:20.219 --> 00:23:23.010
Caption: line through as well and it&#39;ll put a

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.820
Caption: line through the middle like a

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:29.250
Caption: strikethrough I really like this I don&#39;t

00:23:26.819 --> 00:23:33.479
Caption: know why you don&#39;t see it often of

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:35.430
Caption: course you could go a bit nice like idea

00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:37.770
Caption: I thought this was really fun I really

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:40.410
Caption: enjoyed making this one you can style

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:43.050
Caption: the way the line looks this one uses a

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:46.800
Caption: value called wavy which is really fun

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:49.340
Caption: there&#39;s also dotted and double and solid

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.340
Caption: which is boring

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:53.420
Caption: this one like I said before is using

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.670
Caption: line three so it can go through the

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.850
Caption: middle the only thing I would say about

00:23:55.670 --> 00:24:02.150
Caption: wavy is actually put it like under line

00:23:58.849 --> 00:24:04.130
Caption: first because it&#39;s so deep I had to

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.780
Caption: adjust the line height of this when it

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:10.099
Caption: was under underneath so that it actually

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:12.140
Caption: fit so considerations to be made lots of

00:24:10.099 --> 00:24:18.619
Caption: opportunity lots of problems that come

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:22.729
Caption: along with it once that&#39;s about time

00:24:18.619 --> 00:24:24.859
Caption: like oh yeah cool so another thing that

00:24:22.729 --> 00:24:26.809
Caption: I love to do in CSS and this is kind of

00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:27.890
Caption: more of a visual thing but I think it&#39;s

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:31.250
Caption: really important for conveying

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:35.359
Caption: information is under conveying context

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:38.000
Caption: is using shadows and there are two types

00:24:35.359 --> 00:24:39.739
Caption: of shadows in CSS there&#39;s the Box shadow

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.040
Caption: and there&#39;s the text shadow and I&#39;m

00:24:39.739 --> 00:24:44.270
Caption: using both of them in this this is I

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.450
Caption: make this stuff all the time it&#39;s really

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:49.339
Caption: fun I love it&#39;s at this time when I show

00:24:47.449 --> 00:24:50.839
Caption: people some of the shadow stuff that

00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:56.179
Caption: I&#39;ve done they look at it and they&#39;re

00:24:50.839 --> 00:24:59.239
Caption: like whoa what&#39;s going on there it&#39;s

00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:02.600
Caption: actually not very complicated if we look

00:24:59.239 --> 00:25:06.229
Caption: at the boss shadow first on the give

00:25:02.599 --> 00:25:10.459
Caption: I&#39;ve got a 1 pixel key line around the

00:25:06.229 --> 00:25:15.400
Caption: box and then there&#39;s sort of offset e3d

00:25:10.459 --> 00:25:18.770
Caption: looking shadow and all this is doing is

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:21.410
Caption: setting a for the for the key line I

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:24.290
Caption: don&#39;t want it to be offset so I&#39;m not

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:25.729
Caption: setting an x and y coordinate I don&#39;t

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.010
Caption: want it to be blurred which is what this

00:25:25.729 --> 00:25:30.919
Caption: third value is but I want to spread

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:33.500
Caption: which is how far it it goes from the the

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:36.020
Caption: center of one pixel and then a color

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.939
Caption: using a hex value or RGB or whatever you

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:40.030
Caption: want to use and that just gives me this

00:25:37.939 --> 00:25:43.299
Caption: outline here

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:44.830
Caption: the second one gives me this bit now you

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.860
Caption: can keep adding like I&#39;ve done a text

00:25:44.829 --> 00:25:50.439
Caption: shadow as much as you want this one

00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:53.410
Caption: because I want to offset it I&#39;m going 8

00:25:50.439 --> 00:25:55.299
Caption: pixels to the left and a right left

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:57.729
Caption: third left everything so it&#39;s to the

00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:02.190
Caption: left and eight pixels down I&#39;m not

00:25:57.729 --> 00:26:04.359
Caption: blurring it because that&#39;s not fun and

00:26:02.189 --> 00:26:06.250
Caption: ya know spread because I want it to be

00:26:04.359 --> 00:26:08.920
Caption: exactly the size of the container and

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:12.400
Caption: the same approach applies on a text

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:14.770
Caption: shadow exactly the same syntax I&#39;ve got

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:17.020
Caption: a key line around the text so I&#39;ve got

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:19.239
Caption: my one pixel it&#39;s a little bit different

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:21.339
Caption: with text because text shadows are meant

00:26:19.239 --> 00:26:23.859
Caption: to be like a drop shadow so it&#39;s like

00:26:21.339 --> 00:26:26.890
Caption: one angle so you get around this with

00:26:23.859 --> 00:26:30.250
Caption: the text shadow by actually putting in

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:33.040
Caption: for 10 shadows for the key line and you

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:35.859
Caption: offset it bottom left bottom right top

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:41.260
Caption: left top right and then it makes a line

00:26:35.859 --> 00:26:44.140
Caption: and then this second part creates the 3d

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.849
Caption: bit there and all you do is increment

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.010
Caption: the value until you reach the desired

00:26:45.849 --> 00:26:52.119
Caption: distance away from the text that you

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:54.729
Caption: want it to be it&#39;s not very hot it&#39;s

00:26:52.119 --> 00:26:56.829
Caption: just very time-consuming I rate this by

00:26:54.729 --> 00:26:58.719
Caption: hand you don&#39;t have to do that you can

00:26:56.829 --> 00:27:01.599
Caption: use SAS functions if you write SAS or

00:26:58.719 --> 00:27:05.130
Caption: less or stylus or whatever your thing of

00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:07.209
Caption: choices but what I love about shadows is

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:10.540
Caption: that you can do something like this and

00:27:07.209 --> 00:27:13.409
Caption: to me this makes CSS look really awesome

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:15.400
Caption: because that looks pretty sweet I

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:21.070
Caption: challenge anyone to tell me that it&#39;s

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:23.320
Caption: not it&#39;s weekend and you do this by

00:27:21.069 --> 00:27:26.769
Caption: putting a lot of text shadows with a

00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:30.459
Caption: blur and changing the alpha channel of

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:32.680
Caption: the RGB a value and you just offset it

00:27:30.459 --> 00:27:35.729
Caption: and off set it off set it until you

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:39.039
Caption: reach what if I go there

00:27:35.729 --> 00:27:41.739
Caption: 21:39 twenty-one pixels down here and it

00:27:39.038 --> 00:27:44.798
Caption: just fades off this is like my favorite

00:27:41.739 --> 00:27:50.069
Caption: shadow effect in CSS takes forever to

00:27:44.798 --> 00:27:53.288
Caption: ride so I&#39;m just going to finish up with

00:27:50.069 --> 00:27:56.319
Caption: some animation I had heaps but I took

00:27:53.288 --> 00:27:57.699
Caption: them out because some of them were a bit

00:27:56.319 --> 00:28:00.178
Caption: obnoxious and I realized that was

00:27:57.699 --> 00:28:02.439
Caption: probably not a good demonstration of CSS

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:03.668
Caption: when putting this up because if anyone

00:28:02.439 --> 00:28:04.449
Caption: doesn&#39;t like flashy things you&#39;re not

00:28:03.668 --> 00:28:07.239
Caption: gonna like this

00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:09.219
Caption: so I recommend looking away I will tell

00:28:07.239 --> 00:28:17.619
Caption: you when it&#39;s gone I&#39;m gonna change the

00:28:09.219 --> 00:28:20.219
Caption: slide now hang on my video I didn&#39;t play

00:28:17.619 --> 00:28:20.219
Caption: here we go

00:28:21.579 --> 00:28:25.109
Caption: ah last

00:28:26.199 --> 00:28:30.908
Caption: you miss the effect everyone anyway

00:28:29.639 --> 00:28:33.429
Caption: disco

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:36.399
Caption: it&#39;s my disco animation I&#39;ll come back

00:28:33.428 --> 00:28:38.408
Caption: to it maybe it&#39;ll load and the way that

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:41.440
Caption: we do this is with keyframe animations

00:28:38.409 --> 00:28:44.820
Caption: and essentially this is done using the

00:28:41.439 --> 00:28:48.238
Caption: keyframe syntax so it uses this

00:28:44.819 --> 00:28:50.378
Caption: keyframes has to be keyframes with an S

00:28:48.239 --> 00:28:52.869
Caption: sometimes I forget to put that in and it

00:28:50.379 --> 00:28:54.249
Caption: doesn&#39;t work and you give it a name so I

00:28:52.869 --> 00:28:56.499
Caption: called a disco because that seemed

00:28:54.249 --> 00:29:00.700
Caption: appropriate and then you can set up your

00:28:56.499 --> 00:29:03.129
Caption: keyframe and it can be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 100

00:29:00.699 --> 00:29:05.589
Caption: if you wanted to or you can do it at in

00:29:03.129 --> 00:29:08.349
Caption: this case I&#39;ve done 20 percent intervals

00:29:05.589 --> 00:29:10.599
Caption: I think you can literally change any

00:29:08.349 --> 00:29:12.999
Caption: sense property that you want I did

00:29:10.599 --> 00:29:14.949
Caption: background and then I picked random

00:29:12.999 --> 00:29:16.809
Caption: colors didn&#39;t put that much effort into

00:29:14.949 --> 00:29:20.378
Caption: picking the colors I think it turned out

00:29:16.808 --> 00:29:22.619
Caption: pretty sweet and then on the depth so in

00:29:20.379 --> 00:29:26.320
Caption: this case the container that&#39;s around

00:29:22.619 --> 00:29:28.119
Caption: the CSS is awesome you can add the

00:29:26.319 --> 00:29:30.699
Caption: animation and apply it to that container

00:29:28.119 --> 00:29:34.119
Caption: so first up you set the name which is

00:29:30.699 --> 00:29:36.758
Caption: disco then you can put your timing

00:29:34.119 --> 00:29:39.700
Caption: function in which is a thousand

00:29:36.759 --> 00:29:42.369
Caption: milliseconds I&#39;ve also added an

00:29:39.699 --> 00:29:44.498
Caption: iteration count of infinite because the

00:29:42.369 --> 00:29:47.649
Caption: party should literally never end and

00:29:44.499 --> 00:29:50.289
Caption: then you can add an animation direction

00:29:47.649 --> 00:29:52.600
Caption: which in this case I&#39;ve done alternate

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:57.128
Caption: and what that means is it&#39;ll go like

00:29:52.599 --> 00:29:59.798
Caption: this otherwise you&#39;ve got forwards which

00:29:57.129 --> 00:30:02.649
Caption: always just goes forward that looks a

00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:05.349
Caption: bit janky I don&#39;t like that there&#39;s a

00:30:02.649 --> 00:30:08.320
Caption: bunch of options there is a shorthand

00:30:05.349 --> 00:30:10.329
Caption: version of this syntax but I separated

00:30:08.319 --> 00:30:12.579
Caption: them out so you can actually see what

00:30:10.329 --> 00:30:14.168
Caption: they were doing and then for the

00:30:12.579 --> 00:30:16.268
Caption: background I do exactly the same thing

00:30:14.168 --> 00:30:17.278
Caption: but I swap the colors around so that it

00:30:16.269 --> 00:30:20.970
Caption: would look different

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:24.470
Caption: let&#39;s see if this plays again

00:30:20.969 --> 00:30:28.229
Caption: ah that&#39;s so sad it&#39;s my favorite slide

00:30:24.469 --> 00:30:31.140
Caption: anyway we&#39;ll move on but the power of

00:30:28.229 --> 00:30:32.428
Caption: animations on the web is really really

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.289
Caption: awesome you can do really obnoxious

00:30:32.428 --> 00:30:36.779
Caption: things like this you can shake your text

00:30:34.288 --> 00:30:39.269
Caption: you can zoom stuff in and out or you can

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:41.549
Caption: animate in things you can create a

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.808
Caption: storytelling experience and you can help

00:30:41.548 --> 00:30:48.269
Caption: convey your content in a way that&#39;s

00:30:42.808 --> 00:30:53.459
Caption: actually meaningful now another thing

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:55.739
Caption: that you can do is blend modes there&#39;s

00:30:53.459 --> 00:30:59.069
Caption: three blend modes there&#39;s background

00:30:55.739 --> 00:31:00.780
Caption: blend mode and mix blend mode the

00:30:59.069 --> 00:31:04.619
Caption: background blend mode works by having a

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:08.039
Caption: background color and a background image

00:31:04.619 --> 00:31:09.719
Caption: and it blends the two together mixed

00:31:08.038 --> 00:31:12.229
Caption: blend mode works by blending elements

00:31:09.719 --> 00:31:15.058
Caption: that are stacked on top of each other so

00:31:12.229 --> 00:31:20.520
Caption: the background key eyes got a blend mode

00:31:15.058 --> 00:31:22.558
Caption: on this space image and then the h1 has

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:25.409
Caption: the mixed blend mode and that blends

00:31:22.558 --> 00:31:27.779
Caption: into the background of both the

00:31:25.409 --> 00:31:33.690
Caption: container and the text and the

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:37.080
Caption: background and the way this works like

00:31:33.689 --> 00:31:39.509
Caption: this one place so you can see here as I

00:31:37.079 --> 00:31:41.399
Caption: change the color the image changes and

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:43.469
Caption: this might seem a little bit frivolous

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.299
Caption: but actually it&#39;s really good if you

00:31:43.469 --> 00:31:47.939
Caption: want to keep your image file sizes down

00:31:45.298 --> 00:31:50.189
Caption: like greyscale and apply like a tin to

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:52.739
Caption: over the top you can do that you can

00:31:50.189 --> 00:31:55.529
Caption: create interesting hover effects with

00:31:52.739 --> 00:31:57.538
Caption: something like this and they&#39;re really

00:31:55.530 --> 00:32:00.960
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of practical uses for it

00:31:57.538 --> 00:32:02.369
Caption: aside from the pretty ones and what&#39;s

00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:04.709
Caption: great about this is if you&#39;re familiar

00:32:02.369 --> 00:32:08.069
Caption: with Photoshop it&#39;s all the same all the

00:32:04.709 --> 00:32:10.439
Caption: same values darkened lighting screen

00:32:08.069 --> 00:32:11.418
Caption: color dodge exclusion if you don&#39;t know

00:32:10.439 --> 00:32:14.729
Caption: what they are

00:32:11.418 --> 00:32:16.079
Caption: my Mozilla developer Doc&#39;s

00:32:14.729 --> 00:32:17.540
Caption: actually explain them all really really

00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:22.678
Caption: well

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:24.450
Caption: did I go yeah I didn&#39;t cool so actually

00:32:22.678 --> 00:32:31.678
Caption: can blind combine the blend modes and

00:32:24.449 --> 00:32:34.139
Caption: the animations to make this totally

00:32:31.678 --> 00:32:39.659
Caption: amazing video which I&#39;m really sad might

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:41.700
Caption: not actually pay for you that&#39;s sad

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:44.099
Caption: you can go check that out on code pen I

00:32:41.699 --> 00:32:47.880
Caption: might tweet that one later essentially

00:32:44.099 --> 00:32:51.660
Caption: it&#39;s using mix blend mode and sunscreen

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:53.609
Caption: so as it overlays why is that not

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:58.020
Caption: learning I&#39;m really sad it&#39;s my favorite

00:32:53.609 --> 00:33:00.209
Caption: as it overlays it&#39;s sort of masked out

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:04.290
Caption: bits of the text and creates new colors

00:33:00.209 --> 00:33:04.739
Caption: it&#39;s really cool sorry I am going to

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:08.820
Caption: finish up now

00:33:04.739 --> 00:33:09.900
Caption: what what I hope that you at least go

00:33:08.819 --> 00:33:12.149
Caption: down today if you didn&#39;t learn anything

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:17.400
Caption: new that&#39;s fine if you still think CSS

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:19.080
Caption: sucks that&#39;s less fine but ok what I do

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.750
Caption: hope that you get out of this though is

00:33:19.079 --> 00:33:25.049
Caption: that when you see this beam you stop

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:27.989
Caption: thinking about just that one outcome of

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:30.840
Caption: CSS and how it does that and you start

00:33:27.989 --> 00:33:35.010
Caption: thinking about all the opportunity that

00:33:30.839 --> 00:33:37.169
Caption: can be applied to it so you know I

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:39.270
Caption: showed you a bunch of things a bunch of

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:42.540
Caption: ways that you can use CSS to change the

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:46.589
Caption: way content looks and acts and responds

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:49.050
Caption: both practically and for fun but I

00:33:46.589 --> 00:33:51.750
Caption: didn&#39;t really talk about all the other

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:55.410
Caption: things that are in CSS and there&#39;s

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:58.020
Caption: literally so many so many awesome things

00:33:55.410 --> 00:34:00.780
Caption: you can mask things you can skew things

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:03.209
Caption: you can rotate them you we&#39;ve got

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:06.000
Caption: attribute functions and cap functions

00:34:03.209 --> 00:34:07.529
Caption: and selectors that allow you to be

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.290
Caption: specific about something that you want

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:11.428
Caption: in the page this will will change which

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:12.959
Caption: lets you tell the browser that

00:34:11.428 --> 00:34:15.658
Caption: something&#39;s going to change for better

00:34:12.959 --> 00:34:17.398
Caption: performance we&#39;ve got the custom

00:34:15.658 --> 00:34:20.428
Caption: properties now in CSS which are kind of

00:34:17.398 --> 00:34:22.319
Caption: like variables in a very loose sense so

00:34:20.428 --> 00:34:24.989
Caption: it&#39;s really a lot that you can do and

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.479
Caption: you should definitely go and give it a

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:29.089
Caption: whirl try it out

00:34:26.479 --> 00:34:32.358
Caption: but if I definitely haven&#39;t convinced

00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:34.010
Caption: you the CSS is awesome I just we want to

00:34:32.358 --> 00:34:38.658
Caption: show you this which I got sent today

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:41.540
Caption: this is made with CSS it&#39;s all HTML and

00:34:38.658 --> 00:34:44.388
Caption: CSS I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s made

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:48.589
Caption: I got sentenced today wet water notice

00:34:44.388 --> 00:34:51.828
Caption: to yourself holy cow if you look at this

00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:56.419
Caption: there&#39;s like veins and like a freckle

00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:59.150
Caption: and eyelashes eyelashes on this it&#39;s

00:34:56.418 --> 00:35:02.419
Caption: freaking amazing and if you can&#39;t look

00:34:59.149 --> 00:35:06.799
Caption: at this and think CSS is awesome I can&#39;t

00:35:02.419 --> 00:35:09.129
Caption: help you you&#39;re on your own so thank you

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.130
