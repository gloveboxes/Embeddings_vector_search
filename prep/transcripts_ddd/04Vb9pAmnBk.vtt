00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.000
Caption: thanks to our sponsors hope you had a

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.159
Caption: good lunch and speaking of lunch play a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.799
Caption: little game here let&#39;s say we&#39;re going

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:18.600
Caption: for dinner after the conference which

00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:20.909
Caption: one would you go for so just I want

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:27.720
Caption: everyone of you to pick one give you 5

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:30.269
Caption: seconds to one ok easy enough right

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.590
Caption: now one last thing sorry if you&#39;re

00:00:30.268 --> 00:00:35.099
Caption: healthy we&#39;re actually going to the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.979
Caption: pizza place and if you could help me

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:42.988
Caption: take the orders and tell me which pizza

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:44.819
Caption: you would like to go with yeah so I

00:00:42.988 --> 00:00:48.628
Caption: guess we&#39;ve all been in this situation

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:50.819
Caption: before my name is Phil de Valence and

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.460
Caption: I&#39;m the UX consultant I ratified and

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:56.219
Caption: we&#39;re going to look at some principles

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:59.058
Caption: those effects that influence the way

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.870
Caption: people perceive life and by extension

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:06.118
Caption: digital products psychology is central

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:08.819
Caption: to product development and that&#39;s

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.520
Caption: because product development is not about

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:15.839
Caption: products front development is about

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:18.539
Caption: people so if you miss the last few years

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:20.489
Caption: in software development we move from

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.349
Caption: what I call or we&#39;re moving from what I

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:24.269
Caption: call product centered design which is

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:27.089
Caption: quite easy you come up with your vision

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:30.089
Caption: of a product you push it down to users

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:33.618
Caption: if they get it you&#39;re a champion if they

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:33.618
Caption: don&#39;t they&#39;re a little bit stupid

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:39.860
Caption: moving on to human centered design which

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.759
Caption: as you can see is a little trickier

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.470
Caption: because people are context diverse they

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.540
Caption: are nonsensical at times and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.090
Caption: understanding people is key to

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.360
Caption: understanding how to build good products

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:56.578
Caption: for those people to each once you&#39;re

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.399
Caption: gonna say that&#39;s cool because I am a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.759
Caption: human so you should be okay right

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.959
Caption: well that&#39;s my mantra by the way it&#39;s

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.169
Caption: called the egocentric bias and it&#39;s it

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.910
Caption: says that we tend to overestimate how

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:16.300
Caption: our opinions beliefs

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:22.000
Caption: preferences values habits are normal of

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:25.000
Caption: other people now I&#39;m not a trained

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.970
Caption: psychologist but psychology helps us

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.220
Caption: understand about bias we talked a fair

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.550
Caption: bit about bias today about perception

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:39.399
Caption: about emotions helps us understand about

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:42.100
Caption: social cognitive cultural influences if

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:44.709
Caption: we come back to our pizza menu that&#39;s an

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.410
Caption: example of the paradox of choice quite

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.220
Caption: well known or the choice of a load

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.650
Caption: now paradoxically if I give you no

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.619
Caption: options and I go we&#39;re all having a

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:58.479
Caption: Hawaiian pizza maybe if you are gonna go

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:03.220
Caption: yeah and maybe some other people are

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:06.789
Caption: gonna go I hate pineapple fair enough so

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.029
Caption: let&#39;s give people options after a

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:13.569
Caption: certain amount of options you get two

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:16.750
Caption: decision fatigue that&#39;s what I call the

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.290
Caption: baskin-robbins effect and I practice it

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.940
Caption: every week so apparently we make

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:25.389
Caption: according to a study by Columbia

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.940
Caption: University about 70 decisions a day but

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.369
Caption: another study says that if you can&#39;t

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.130
Caption: remotely conscious decisions it goes up

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:38.589
Caption: to 35 thousand decisions a day shall I

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:42.070
Caption: scratch my write that adds up limiting

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:44.470
Caption: the options is going to reduce the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.710
Caption: cognitive load and cognitive load is

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.330
Caption: pretty much the amount of information

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:57.040
Caption: your brain it&#39;s your run to brains run

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:00.940
Caption: talking to experts yourself so this law

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:03.189
Caption: is known as Hicksville it&#39;s very simple

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.199
Caption: and a lot of what we&#39;re going to talk

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.610
Caption: about today is common sense the thing is

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.459
Caption: we need to know when to apply it to

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.050
Caption: building product and that says that the

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:16.480
Caption: more choices you have the longer it

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:18.790
Caption: takes to make decisions now I was on

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.380
Caption: this music mastering platform a year ago

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.820
Caption: it was quite different to that that&#39;s

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.040
Caption: what it looks like today I couldn&#39;t find

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.540
Caption: the screens but each one of those

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.160
Caption: pricing tiers

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.580
Caption: would lead to a page with another four

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.860
Caption: of five pricing tiers that was 16 to 20

00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:37.959
Caption: pricing options on different pages I

00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:40.269
Caption: might yeah I was going to go to an OA

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:45.190
Caption: another product another website I wrote

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:49.959
Caption: to them instead now they&#39;ve got fortunes

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.720
Caption: and I believe it&#39;s thanks to me we all

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:57.160
Caption: do that right it could be better with

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.769
Caption: the bond rest of effect or also known as

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.339
Caption: the isolation effect so when you have

00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:05.109
Caption: multiple multiple similar objects the

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:07.389
Caption: one that stands out that&#39;s different is

00:05:05.109 --> 00:05:08.409
Caption: going to be more easily remembered now

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.970
Caption: you may say we don&#39;t want people

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.250
Caption: necessarily to remember our user

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.470
Caption: interfaces or the layouts of our

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.660
Caption: products but if it&#39;s easy to memorize

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.250
Caption: it&#39;s also easier the next time you come

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.510
Caption: to find your way around it if we use

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.029
Caption: another pricing table here

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.910
Caption: you can see that one of them&#39;s been

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:30.339
Caption: highlighted as recommended if you go

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.350
Caption: back to the pizza place can help if the

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:34.449
Caption: waiter goes well our special we&#39;re

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.209
Caption: really good at it is the margarita and

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:41.470
Caption: you&#39;re gonna go yeah or maybe not but

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:43.539
Caption: that reinforces your decision another

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.480
Caption: takeaway would be to have clear action

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:51.869
Caption: buttons in your interfaces and not only

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.870
Caption: but also menu highlighted menu item

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:03.100
Caption: talking of cognitive load what do you

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.559
Caption: see here a lot of dots well the the law

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.360
Caption: of common region says that elements tend

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:10.209
Caption: to be perceived in two groups in groups

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:12.939
Caption: if they are sharing an area with a

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:16.179
Caption: clearly defined border so it&#39;s very

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.250
Caption: simple again but unless you do that you

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:23.649
Caption: go from a big mess to something that&#39;s

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:26.290
Caption: more manageable very close to that no

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:27.639
Caption: pun intended is a lot of proximity which

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.800
Caption: plays the key the same that using white

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.620
Caption: spaces using elements in different

00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:34.449
Caption: spaces a takeaway for this is well for

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:37.119
Caption: example if you mix important content

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.409
Caption: with ads for example in the same area

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:45.498
Caption: people may think your content

00:06:39.408 --> 00:06:48.708
Caption: is an ad another two quick takeaways on

00:06:45.498 --> 00:06:53.299
Caption: the left one of those beautiful IT parts

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:55.909
Caption: websites with about 150 items without

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:57.438
Caption: any kind of structure on the left and on

00:06:55.908 --> 00:07:03.618
Caption: the right you can see things have been

00:06:57.438 --> 00:07:04.878
Caption: chunked together and you may wonder how

00:07:03.618 --> 00:07:07.609
Caption: much is too much

00:07:04.878 --> 00:07:08.269
Caption: actually when what is manageable and

00:07:07.609 --> 00:07:11.208
Caption: what&#39;s not

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:13.729
Caption: well there&#39;s a lot for that it&#39;s millas

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:15.349
Caption: low and mills low you can take different

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:18.709
Caption: ways but basically it says the average

00:07:15.348 --> 00:07:20.958
Caption: person can keep seven items in their

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:24.769
Caption: working memory I know you&#39;re not the

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:27.169
Caption: average person maybe you can go to 1450

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:29.139
Caption: or if you&#39;re Rain Man many more but the

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:32.718
Caption: reality is seven plus or minus two

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:35.748
Caption: there&#39;s another side to it at any moment

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:36.618
Caption: you can detect about seven objects in

00:07:35.748 --> 00:07:40.968
Caption: your environment

00:07:36.618 --> 00:07:42.408
Caption: that is useful for example if I&#39;m

00:07:40.968 --> 00:07:43.848
Caption: designing website I&#39;m going to make sure

00:07:42.408 --> 00:07:46.248
Caption: the main navigation the main menu

00:07:43.848 --> 00:07:48.708
Caption: doesn&#39;t go away over seven eight nine

00:07:46.248 --> 00:07:53.109
Caption: items if not I&#39;m gonna think about my

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:57.610
Caption: architecture again oh sorry

00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:57.609
Caption: someone act into my slideshow

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:06.929
Caption: well it won&#39;t happen again

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:09.650
Caption: oh I hope it will did you know that in

00:08:06.929 --> 00:08:11.970
Caption: the 70s people thought it was okay for

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:15.809
Caption: computers to take approximately two

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:17.040
Caption: seconds to respond to user input well of

00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:20.519
Caption: course there were technical restrictions

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.190
Caption: back in the days but still they thought

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:25.379
Caption: that with two seconds users could plan

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.779
Caption: out the next task and as technology

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:30.500
Caption: evolved a gentleman called Walter

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:35.369
Caption: Doherty of IBM you notice that computer

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:36.960
Caption: performance improved as computer

00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:40.229
Caption: performance improved there was a massive

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.970
Caption: increase in productivity and also

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:44.699
Caption: employees got more satisfaction from

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:48.539
Caption: their work and work quality tended to

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:50.520
Caption: improve so the hurt is threshold is

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:54.630
Caption: actually a number it&#39;s 400 milliseconds

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:56.850
Caption: it&#39;s not you know maths but if you keep

00:08:54.630 --> 00:09:00.150
Caption: that interaction to a minimum that&#39;s

00:08:56.849 --> 00:09:02.190
Caption: when you get that result now a little

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:04.110
Caption: challenge I would love for all the

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.659
Caption: websites in the world to load under 400

00:09:04.109 --> 00:09:08.969
Caption: milliseconds the average time for

00:09:06.659 --> 00:09:12.119
Caption: websites to load on mobile today is 22

00:09:08.969 --> 00:09:15.509
Caption: seconds Google&#39;s strive to go under half

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:19.619
Caption: a second with all their products it&#39;s

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.910
Caption: good to have challenges in life now on

00:09:19.619 --> 00:09:24.089

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:37.500
Caption: that users spend most of their time on

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.869
Caption: other people&#39;s websites which means that

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.580
Caption: when they get onto your website they

00:09:39.869 --> 00:09:43.710

00:10:00.979 --> 00:10:07.559
Caption: not as funny the third or fourth but

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.410
Caption: sometimes you need to make a difference

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:11.190
Caption: between creativity and usability right

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:15.719
Caption: you need to

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:18.299
Caption: know the rules before you can break the

00:10:15.719 --> 00:10:21.449
Caption: rules and if you&#39;re reinventing the

00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:24.299
Caption: wheel well make sure that it&#39;s better

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.950
Caption: than the will if not what&#39;s the point

00:10:24.299 --> 00:10:29.700
Caption: really have you ever been on a forum

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:32.100

Caption: feet slow very simple the time to

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.900
Caption: acquire a target is a factor of the

00:10:43.739 --> 00:10:50.099
Caption: distance to the target and the size of

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:52.320
Caption: the target now I would have you a lot of

00:10:50.099 --> 00:10:55.259

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.960

Caption: of us are gamers well not everyone is

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.920

Caption: not going to go through every one of

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:05.849
Caption: them are just going to illustrate that

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:10.800
Caption: with an example with 44 points minimum

00:11:05.849 --> 00:11:12.500
Caption: size on a touch device but also

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:16.049
Caption: something like this for example

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.250
Caption: personally I use keyboard shortcuts I&#39;m

00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:21.119
Caption: not going to try and click on that thing

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:24.239

00:11:21.119 --> 00:11:27.750
Caption: after jacobs low Millett slow feet slow

00:11:24.239 --> 00:11:30.529
Caption: this one is really the most important of

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:35.789
Caption: all and the one I want you to remember

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:38.070
Caption: cottesloe want one happen again no the

00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:41.190
Caption: next one is actually very cool because

Caption: it&#39;s got the word cocktail in it it&#39;s a

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.450
Caption: cocktail party effect imagine you had a

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.030

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:52.230
Caption: music everyone&#39;s screaming on top of

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:54.720
Caption: their heads voices and you&#39;re trying to

00:11:52.229 --> 00:11:57.000
Caption: have a conversation well your auditory

00:11:54.719 --> 00:12:00.029
Caption: senses do something that&#39;s really crazy

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.280
Caption: they actually cut off any external noise

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.950
Caption: so you can try and focus on the person

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:07.530
Caption: that&#39;s talking to you

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:10.410
Caption: well that text Todd tells us about our

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:12.270
Caption: ability to focus our attention also to

00:12:10.409 --> 00:12:13.889
Caption: switch our attention because sometimes

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:15.690
Caption: really I&#39;m pretending like I&#39;m talking

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:17.799
Caption: to someone but I&#39;m listening to much

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:21.720
Caption: more interesting conversation behind me

00:12:17.799 --> 00:12:21.719
Caption: don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve never done that a

00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:28.229
Caption: take away if you look at this page the

00:12:26.469 --> 00:12:32.439
Caption: first thing you you think is probably

00:12:28.229 --> 00:12:35.729
Caption: yeah but the second thing is what what

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:39.340
Caption: is the goal what&#39;s the aim here what

00:12:35.729 --> 00:12:42.510
Caption: where do we go and another thing is

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:45.340
Caption: really banner blindness there&#39;s a lot of

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.600
Caption: things that look like ads which means

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.640
Caption: people are not going to look at them

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:50.469
Caption: because they aren&#39;t I was talking about

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.020
Caption: Jakob Nielsen Nielsen Norman group did

00:12:50.469 --> 00:12:54.339
Caption: studies in the late 90s and then 10

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.670
Caption: years later and then a couple years back

00:12:54.340 --> 00:13:00.550
Caption: where they go that people absolutely

00:12:57.669 --> 00:13:02.739
Caption: ignore the ad even though the sneaking

00:13:00.549 --> 00:13:04.839
Caption: UX designer MIT made that ad look

00:13:02.739 --> 00:13:06.940
Caption: exactly like the rest of the content now

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.520
Caption: I&#39;m not looking at it when they look at

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:12.010
Caption: ads then they repent and never look at

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.210
Caption: it again it&#39;s studies prove it over and

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:17.080
Caption: over again I&#39;m not saying we don&#39;t need

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:20.369
Caption: ads I mean there&#39;s financial realities

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:22.690
Caption: but how do you get people&#39;s attention

00:13:20.369 --> 00:13:27.070
Caption: that&#39;s an example of selective attention

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:29.710
Caption: by the way well one way is the serial

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:33.429
Caption: position effect so we have found out

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:36.360
Caption: that people best remember the first and

00:13:33.429 --> 00:13:38.979
Caption: last item in a group of items

00:13:36.359 --> 00:13:41.890
Caption: journalists know that for example and I

00:13:38.979 --> 00:13:43.989
Caption: would say one takeaway for us content is

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.549
Caption: not to distill your important

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:48.039
Caption: information in the middle of the

00:13:45.549 --> 00:13:50.409
Caption: paragraph no one reads on the web come

00:13:48.039 --> 00:13:52.329
Caption: on you don&#39;t believe that except for the

00:13:50.409 --> 00:13:54.549
Caption: terms and conditions of both but no one

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:57.190
Caption: is anything like they just skim through

00:13:54.549 --> 00:14:02.979
Caption: so if you don&#39;t start with the point you

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:07.270
Caption: may lose the point 10 the authority

00:14:02.979 --> 00:14:09.820
Caption: principle humans tend to comply with

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:13.170
Caption: people in positions of authority or

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:18.280
Caption: perceived Authority so can be physicians

00:14:13.169 --> 00:14:21.669
Caption: can be policemen can be lawyers or

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:24.850
Caption: experts and that can lead to an ethical

00:14:21.669 --> 00:14:28.349
Caption: behaviors like spamming for example hey

00:14:24.849 --> 00:14:28.349
Caption: I&#39;m the police give me your money

00:14:28.528 --> 00:14:34.809
Caption: but it can also be used for the greater

00:14:31.028 --> 00:14:36.130
Caption: good altogether the greater good okay

00:14:34.809 --> 00:14:40.690

00:14:46.028 --> 00:14:49.989
Caption: system which is quite well known and

00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:52.088
Caption: established and you know in general it&#39;s

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:57.669
Caption: not like two or three people voted or

00:14:52.088 --> 00:15:02.140
Caption: reviewed so that&#39;s one usage of that but

00:14:57.669 --> 00:15:05.079
Caption: also the Business Insider quote the best

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.609
Caption: planner overall you&#39;ve got to understand

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:11.528

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:47.140

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.739

00:15:56.739 --> 00:16:03.250
Caption: wanted to go north okay well that

00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:05.890
Caption: reveals something one it&#39;s quite

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:08.080
Caption: unpleasant to be on a journey without

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:10.778
Caption: knowing the destination it can be

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:13.809
Caption: exciting but a lot of times in digital

00:16:10.778 --> 00:16:17.140
Caption: products it is unpleasant another thing

00:16:13.809 --> 00:16:20.140
Caption: that can be unpleasant is to be on a

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:24.130
Caption: journey to a well-defined destination

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:26.440
Caption: that that&#39;s basically why we here but

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:28.088

Caption: users very kindly offers something very

00:16:58.289 --> 00:17:05.280
Caption: precious which is their time and their

00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:07.410
Caption: attention but we shouldn&#39;t abuse it and

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.030
Caption: take them on journeys that they are not

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:13.739
Caption: here for they&#39;re not sign up for it and

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:16.469
Caption: basically it&#39;s gonna piss them off a

00:17:13.739 --> 00:17:18.479
Caption: take away from this law of where the

00:17:16.469 --> 00:17:20.459
Caption: heck are you taking me is it&#39;s always

00:17:18.479 --> 00:17:23.219
Caption: good to use a progress indicator on

00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:25.020
Caption: paginate it forms for example but I&#39;m

00:17:23.219 --> 00:17:26.909
Caption: also thinking at a much higher level in

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.790
Caption: the products architecture in the

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:34.739

Caption: itinerary where you are on the map now

00:17:40.109 --> 00:17:43.739
Caption: we&#39;ve seen a few points like I was

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:46.560
Caption: saying there&#39;s many more but a few

00:17:43.739 --> 00:17:48.750
Caption: takeaways you will notice they go

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.180
Caption: towards simplification that&#39;s one

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:53.900
Caption: important thing that less is more

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:57.180
Caption: avoid unnecessary elements or tasks

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:59.099
Caption: minimize choices chunks elements

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:04.110
Caption: together you need to do the hard work

00:17:59.099 --> 00:18:06.929
Caption: not the users use consistency respect

00:18:04.109 --> 00:18:09.569
Caption: the users but another one would be to

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:12.030
Caption: test test your interfaces test your

00:18:09.569 --> 00:18:14.459

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:17.820
Caption: conversation with the users why

00:18:14.459 --> 00:18:19.770

Caption: done two years ago in certain areas

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:30.450
