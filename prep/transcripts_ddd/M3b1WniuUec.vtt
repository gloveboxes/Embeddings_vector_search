00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:11.309
Caption: pulse in the room I think anyone is

00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:13.920
Caption: gonna team up in Charlie I&#39;m really

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:26.000
Caption: excited talking about service so

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:28.139
Caption: before we get into my career

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.179
Caption: architecting back in distributed systems

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:35.610
Caption: as well so this is a special area of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.739
Caption: interest for me people to stand whose

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.559
Caption: courage of service mission package

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:53.788
Caption: before cool a few hands who&#39;s using what

00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:58.078
Caption: a reduction is to explore the motivation

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.329
Caption: behind what problem does it solve

00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:06.658
Caption: particularly what category of problems

00:01:00.328 --> 00:01:08.309
Caption: will it solve you how it contrasts with

00:01:06.658 --> 00:01:10.679
Caption: previous approaches I&#39;m going to take

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:12.419
Caption: that any stroll through how our thinking

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.669
Caption: has evolved over the years so we&#39;ll look

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:16.349
Caption: at a good gateways we&#39;ll look at I could

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:18.000
Caption: all friendly into my service boss let&#39;s

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:19.589
Caption: see how this there&#39;s a lot of parallels

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.150
Caption: and similarities between them

00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:24.449
Caption: photography on political differences as

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.069
Caption: well so absolute gains been

00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:28.459
Caption: understanding their nwandi is how I

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.459
Caption: could help

00:01:30.449 --> 00:02:23.039
Caption: easier today has a story it&#39;s beautiful

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.179
Caption: [Music]

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:16.119
Caption: when you&#39;re talking in process is just

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.370
Caption: simple but now we have to deal with all

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:26.048
Caption: of these things of the unreliability of

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:27.699
Caption: the deadline is compact this is what

00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:31.750
Caption: they call the ink fallacies industry

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:32.860
Caption: completed and called out to warn us

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:40.690
Caption: against some of the false assumption

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:41.440
Caption: that we make is not reliable latency is

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.220
Caption: not zero

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.800
Caption: your letter does not eat them arrive and

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.208
Caption: width is not unlimited again human a

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:56.708
Caption: postal service building has known so

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:59.559
Caption: many letters so some of these again so

00:03:56.708 --> 00:04:03.488
Caption: we mentioned this flow control service

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:05.020
Caption: agents in as most desert you can see fit

00:04:03.488 --> 00:04:07.179
Caption: the service people want again if it

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.400
Caption: overloads it does that Dana get lost

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:12.189
Caption: have you then move down service even

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:13.958
Caption: just problem too much data acid and this

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.639
Caption: is typically what we suspected back to

00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.979
Caption: the fifties there were these distributed

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:22.660
Caption: systems I gave the application tier

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:25.149
Caption: itself to you know on all of this logic

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.979
Caption: feed to add that reliability itself it

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:32.519
Caption: didn&#39;t get a lot of help in fact the

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:35.289
Caption: help that we just given today one thing

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:38.940
Caption: for the highlights of point is maybe

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.940
Caption: this distributed computing thing

00:04:40.859 --> 00:04:44.918
Caption: and in fact if we were finished with

00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:47.859
Caption: flow control that would be one thing but

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.619
Caption: there are so many different concerns is

00:04:47.859 --> 00:04:52.868
Caption: reliability observability and traffic

00:04:50.618 --> 00:04:57.968
Caption: management and for each of them we

00:04:52.868 --> 00:05:00.218
Caption: continue to it so Watson so against it

00:04:57.968 --> 00:05:03.308
Caption: so against you don&#39;t dependency a single

00:05:00.218 --> 00:05:05.139
Caption: node but at the seconds any algorithm

00:05:03.308 --> 00:05:06.518
Caption: see you use drone profit you can own as

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.709
Caption: points you could do nice to see you

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:09.848
Caption: where know about the sink so again you

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:12.759
Caption: know there&#39;s various levels of maturity

00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:16.628
Caption: here service discovery how do I actually

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:19.989
Caption: know where to send by traffic and often

00:05:16.628 --> 00:05:22.958
Caption: DNS alone will not be sufficient there&#39;s

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:24.759
Caption: access control and again this prayer

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:27.029
Caption: request routing so we really have this

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:30.188
Caption: advanced distributed system being able

00:05:27.028 --> 00:05:32.438
Caption: individually control each request is

00:05:30.188 --> 00:05:37.208
Caption: incredibly powerful capability as you

00:05:32.438 --> 00:05:39.579
Caption: see we move forward observability so

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:40.689
Caption: we&#39;re interested in insight into our

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:42.569
Caption: system running conducted themselves

00:05:40.688 --> 00:05:45.609
Caption: success rates

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:48.968
Caption: latency logs so factor distributed

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:51.698
Caption: systems latency you know and leg that&#39;s

00:05:48.968 --> 00:05:55.259
Caption: returning slowly it&#39;s actually more

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:59.348
Caption: difficult to deal with the data simply

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:00.699
Caption: complexity to it so they&#39;ll get the

00:05:59.348 --> 00:06:03.218
Caption: student in tracing so if you&#39;ve worked

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:06.399
Caption: with city which is implementation of

00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:08.438
Caption: open tracing so again trying to fill the

00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:12.908
Caption: picture of all the requests as they flow

00:06:08.438 --> 00:06:15.188
Caption: through the system we have two projects

00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:17.319
Caption: pretty typical circuit breakers again

00:06:15.188 --> 00:06:19.268
Caption: how do we build reliability in to

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:23.859
Caption: correlate that by the beatdown it&#39;s

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:25.509
Caption: basically down reach my policies if I

00:06:23.859 --> 00:06:28.168
Caption: call the service and fails it is safe to

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.169
Caption: call it again

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.839
Caption: I think in timeouts the classic kind of

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.850
Caption: concerning the student assistance but

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:39.619
Caption: again shooting those timeouts so have

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.869
Caption: them conservative enough that you&#39;re not

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:44.299
Caption: risking resources be consumed at the

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:45.799
Caption: same time not making sure that your

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:50.329
Caption: prematurely causing families across your

00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:56.750
Caption: system so what we consider all of these

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:57.619
Caption: things it&#39;s actually seen where there&#39;s

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.290
Caption: a will there&#39;s a way

00:06:57.619 --> 00:07:05.600
Caption: so how did we then actually start to

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:08.540
Caption: scale out some of these capabilities for

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:12.260
Caption: instance it moved from the application

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.930
Caption: tier to the networking tier so again no

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.760
Caption: longer was a concern to the application

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:18.559
Caption: developer instance they could just make

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.770
Caption: the call and a lot of that in order to

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:25.100
Caption: delivery retry zone that was handled at

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:26.629
Caption: the TCP layer and this was an incredible

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.250
Caption: boon for us so again instead of dealing

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.589
Caption: with selling physical goods across the

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.290
Caption: wire or then at layer 2 we have a mix of

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:37.010
Caption: it data frames that are finally at the

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:40.010
Caption: IP layer we have addressing TCP that

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:42.410
Caption: gave us all of that power so we can just

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.119
Caption: send the request across the huge one of

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.950
Caption: the complexity of doing it reliably was

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:49.669
Caption: at the London it right here it&#39;s a

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:51.800
Caption: distracted away from us again that

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.320
Caption: pattern repeats itself time and time

00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:57.529
Caption: again so it has we know build more

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.700
Caption: complicated systems we applied that same

00:07:57.529 --> 00:08:01.790
Caption: logic

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.350
Caption: so whereby we had to handle certain

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.910
Caption: concerns like services scrubbing the

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:10.130
Caption: application to you&#39;ll see that we want

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:12.649
Caption: to push them down into you know

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.540
Caption: a centralized location and that&#39;s what

00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:16.459
Caption: we did with enterprise service possible

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:20.199
Caption: so then one of the ideas from there is

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:27.649
Caption: again we had these multitude of services

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:29.660
Caption: npp it&#39;s a proprietary scheme but they

00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:31.220
Caption: wanted interoperability between those so

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.510
Caption: if you look it but a service boss we add

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.028
Caption: into this essential piece of

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.679
Caption: communication infrastructure which then

00:08:35.028 --> 00:08:39.950
Caption: had adapters such that you could then

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:51.140
Caption: take maybe one form of XML and forward

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:53.150
Caption: into another message as well these were

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.619
Caption: actually incredibly popular to this

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.020
Caption: solve the real problem to begin with

00:08:54.619 --> 00:08:58.669
Caption: namely how do you get dis persistence to

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.350
Caption: communicate and again we can build

00:08:58.669 --> 00:09:03.919
Caption: workflows about typically this is an

00:09:00.349 --> 00:09:05.359
Caption: orchestration based look and should have

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:07.989
Caption: actually worked on one of these are the

00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:10.489
Caption: team up in other what we introduced one

00:09:07.989 --> 00:09:13.640
Caption: yeah but the first hundred integrations

00:09:10.489 --> 00:09:15.469
Caption: were amazingly quick but then after that

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.660
Caption: things start to go and services that in

00:09:15.469 --> 00:09:19.219
Caption: common incredibly complicated when we

00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:21.799
Caption: changed one integration was start to

00:09:19.219 --> 00:09:23.629
Caption: break another and then was like okay

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:25.250
Caption: well let&#39;s see how it&#39;ll scale the team

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.479
Caption: and more spread rules mythical man-month

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:32.020
Caption: you can keep drawing people at a problem

00:09:28.479 --> 00:09:34.039
Caption: but operationally they also have

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.010
Caption: typically a centralized architecture

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:39.778
Caption: will result in a single

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.338
Caption: so again with any distributed adaptive

00:09:39.778 --> 00:09:46.679
Caption: system there were to keep in fact

00:09:41.338 --> 00:09:48.359
Caption: looking to an overweight and again when

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:51.149
Caption: you putting or consolidating all this

00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:53.789
Caption: logic at one place it becomes complex

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:56.010
Caption: it&#39;s harder for one person to understand

00:09:53.789 --> 00:09:59.338
Caption: the mental model of the system and then

00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:01.140
Caption: that&#39;s when actually changes confidence

00:09:59.338 --> 00:10:02.849
Caption: is a huge thing when you&#39;re looking to

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.500
Caption: release it if you can&#39;t understand the

00:10:02.849 --> 00:10:07.019
Caption: entire system of people get nervous with

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.849
Caption: this risk that&#39;s where the speed at

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:15.838
Caption: which is there to to point

00:10:08.849 --> 00:10:17.639
Caption: slows down include native came along and

00:10:15.838 --> 00:10:20.130
Caption: this really looks to challenge and other

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:25.109
Caption: pervading thinking to that point there&#39;s

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:27.119
Caption: four main pillars DevOps how do you

00:10:25.109 --> 00:10:28.859
Caption: build a culture around continuous

00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:31.409
Caption: learning how&#39;d you build what about

00:10:28.859 --> 00:10:34.349
Caption: sharing how to support that culture to

00:10:31.409 --> 00:10:37.679
Caption: automation that then empirical decisions

00:10:34.349 --> 00:10:39.119
Caption: based on metrics and data putting that

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:43.250
Caption: into practice with continuous delivery

00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:45.900
Caption: to actually create those feedback loops

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:48.028
Caption: micro-services to provide the same level

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.490
Caption: of agility in your architecture as you

00:10:48.028 --> 00:10:52.619
Caption: have in your delivery process I finally

00:10:50.489 --> 00:10:54.599
Caption: containers as the packaging progress so

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:58.309
Caption: hooli away from heavyweight vm&#39;s to

00:10:54.599 --> 00:11:00.778
Caption: light of containers and lightweight

00:10:58.309 --> 00:11:02.760
Caption: components awesome again you have more

00:11:00.778 --> 00:11:05.088
Caption: flexibility in the house host any move

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.088
Caption: them around

00:11:07.278 --> 00:11:10.729
Caption: so remember the original sort of

00:11:09.078 --> 00:11:11.898
Caption: dialogue that service a service B so

00:11:10.729 --> 00:11:13.849
Caption: what we&#39;ve now seen in the market

00:11:11.898 --> 00:11:18.729
Caption: services world is that has exploded

00:11:13.849 --> 00:11:18.729
Caption: there are connections going everywhere

00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:29.028
Caption: again to instead of the centralized the

00:11:26.508 --> 00:11:30.008
Caption: s be there we&#39;ve actually think put all

00:11:29.028 --> 00:11:33.739
Caption: its vets

00:11:30.008 --> 00:11:36.198
Caption: into the services themselves so once a

00:11:33.739 --> 00:11:39.138
Caption: service services business logic and data

00:11:36.198 --> 00:11:42.979
Caption: with an ESB we often had all of the

00:11:39.138 --> 00:11:46.068
Caption: logic at the ESP itself going to be data

00:11:42.979 --> 00:11:47.838
Caption: entry inputs these flips a lot ahead and

00:11:46.068 --> 00:11:50.299
Caption: say we want to keep the debt work done

00:11:47.838 --> 00:11:52.099
Caption: but we want to have all of the business

00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:55.008
Caption: logic gates of the data in the intervals

00:11:52.099 --> 00:11:56.508
Caption: individual services themselves and this

00:11:55.008 --> 00:11:58.638
Caption: is sort of being paraphrasing like the

00:11:56.508 --> 00:12:05.688
Caption: guerrilla SOA movers has smart endpoints

00:11:58.638 --> 00:12:07.909
Caption: and dumb pipes so this apply that to so

00:12:05.689 --> 00:12:09.829
Caption: again with saying service discovery you

00:12:07.909 --> 00:12:13.549
Caption: know I can&#39;t find ports and DNS I need

00:12:09.828 --> 00:12:15.018
Caption: something a bit richer circuit breakers

00:12:13.549 --> 00:12:17.208
Caption: again to make sure that our component

00:12:15.018 --> 00:12:19.638
Caption: downstream services which you know might

00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:22.458
Caption: not be reliable how do I then wrap that

00:12:19.638 --> 00:12:24.799
Caption: function then I did a create failures

00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:27.528
Caption: over time and to fill the sector also at

00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:28.539
Caption: the time of the court that he couldn&#39;t

00:12:27.528 --> 00:12:31.000
Caption: keep that dosing

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:33.789
Caption: master of government but what we&#39;re

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.710
Caption: seeing in the same way that a critical

00:12:33.789 --> 00:12:37.839
Caption: baby boomer services speak to worry

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.220
Caption: about full control all the best services

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:46.450
Caption: and no having to worry about all of

00:12:39.219 --> 00:12:51.789
Caption: these complex concerns again picture

00:12:46.450 --> 00:13:04.600
Caption: benefits of micro services was for the

00:12:51.789 --> 00:13:08.169
Caption: particular problem these you know how we

00:13:04.599 --> 00:13:12.039
Caption: address back then was shift these

00:13:08.169 --> 00:13:13.119
Caption: concerns out to a side care proxy so

00:13:12.039 --> 00:13:15.549
Caption: we&#39;re gonna prop Z that will handle

00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:19.419
Caption: ingress and egress from that particular

00:13:15.549 --> 00:13:22.659
Caption: services which we can then include the

00:13:19.419 --> 00:13:25.000
Caption: circuit breakers and discovery and retry

00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:28.329
Caption: policies and all that at that particular

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.219
Caption: site so there are examples such as

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.750
Caption: Crowder for Netflix they came out one of

00:13:30.219 --> 00:13:34.179
Caption: the beautiful things are here is that

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.770
Caption: just HTTP between it so you can have a

00:13:34.179 --> 00:13:38.049
Caption: legacy service that hasn&#39;t been written

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:41.380
Caption: with any of these concerns in place and

00:13:38.049 --> 00:13:47.979
Caption: then encapsulate that can do shaadi your

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:49.780
Caption: language of choice we don&#39;t have to say

00:13:47.979 --> 00:13:52.299
Caption: well I could only write this in Java but

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:55.000
Caption: we use the deference over you know

00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:58.659
Caption: service pack and go everything has to be

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.119
Caption: written than that one language so it

00:13:58.659 --> 00:14:03.639
Caption: gives from a deployment perspective we

00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:05.770
Caption: have now all of the communication in and

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:09.580
Caption: our individual micro services happening

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:11.350
Caption: through these side care proxies and from

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.880
Caption: if I demonstrate enterprise integration

00:14:11.349 --> 00:14:14.880
Caption: patterns that is an example of

00:14:18.440 --> 00:15:21.289
Caption: this is one of the underpinning of is

00:15:18.219 --> 00:15:21.288
Caption: [Music]

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.419
Caption: [Music]

00:15:33.679 --> 00:15:45.239
Caption: into this dedicated layer and the

00:15:39.179 --> 00:15:48.539
Caption: special surprise to parents so the Daisy

00:15:45.239 --> 00:15:50.580
Caption: plane we have already seen so the server

00:15:48.539 --> 00:15:52.559
Caption: fish is everything that&#39;s in the flow of

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:57.088
Caption: the traffic you take two services so

00:15:52.559 --> 00:16:01.849
Caption: particularly the site care proxy control

00:15:57.088 --> 00:16:06.750
Caption: plane and that is how we actually get

00:16:01.849 --> 00:16:09.690
Caption: centralized management services sits

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:12.690
Caption: outside of each of the individual

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:16.588
Caption: microservices very beautifully and

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:18.690
Caption: allows us to push policy to each of

00:16:16.588 --> 00:16:21.539
Caption: these service so what we can do is we

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:24.510
Caption: can configure in the control plane and

00:16:21.539 --> 00:16:26.429
Caption: then have that push the policy out into

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:28.470
Caption: each one of these individual terms and

00:16:26.429 --> 00:16:33.599
Caption: so you want to change how our education

00:16:28.469 --> 00:16:35.729
Caption: happens here and you can roll it out to

00:16:33.599 --> 00:16:39.509
Caption: each one of those properties and you

00:16:35.729 --> 00:16:40.199
Caption: have consistency you want to change your

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:45.510
Caption: timeouts

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:48.869
Caption: you can do it centrally controlled that

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:51.150
Caption: we have the control the exact same as we

00:16:48.869 --> 00:16:54.059
Caption: had without centralized DSP with a key

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:56.910
Caption: difference so with the ESB both the

00:16:54.059 --> 00:16:59.338
Caption: control plane and the data plane were in

00:16:56.909 --> 00:17:02.699
Caption: one unit the control plan was on the

00:16:59.338 --> 00:17:05.338
Caption: critical path as you see here if the

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.708
Caption: control plane goes down that&#39;s fine the

00:17:05.338 --> 00:17:09.599
Caption: service carries on just as it was before

00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:11.609
Caption: we just can&#39;t update the policy and

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:13.828
Caption: that&#39;s fine for us we still have

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:16.020
Caption: deniable delivering between all of these

00:17:13.828 --> 00:17:17.818
Caption: services and if you wrote a lot platform

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:20.068
Caption: at kubernetes akin to having deposits

00:17:17.818 --> 00:17:22.500
Caption: configure to auto scale so that&#39;s

00:17:20.068 --> 00:17:25.318
Caption: beautiful so we&#39;ve no decoupled our

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:29.660
Caption: concerns of application traffic routing

00:17:25.318 --> 00:17:29.659
Caption: from our infrastructure scaling as well

00:17:29.739 --> 00:17:33.890
Caption: [Music]

00:17:31.689 --> 00:17:43.459
Caption: so with little insight cats and

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:45.020
Caption: everything know your application still

00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:47.689
Caption: needs to have a certain level of

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:50.119
Caption: maturity to warrant investment in this

00:17:47.689 --> 00:17:52.309
Caption: so again if you have a model if again

00:17:50.119 --> 00:17:54.319
Caption: and we would end up with one side carrot

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:56.780
Caption: like don&#39;t bother there was a lot of

00:17:54.319 --> 00:17:58.669
Caption: complexity inherent with this so hasn&#39;t

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.650
Caption: any new piece of technology make sure

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:02.989
Caption: that you have the problems that he&#39;ll

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:08.239
Caption: actually aims to solve and a little bit

00:18:02.989 --> 00:18:14.030
Caption: over to thought conceptually about what

00:18:08.239 --> 00:18:16.099
Caption: a service mesh is particularly which

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:18.080
Caption: actually the major Mulsim so this is a

00:18:16.099 --> 00:18:20.719
Caption: service fish from Google and a number of

00:18:18.079 --> 00:18:23.299
Caption: other companies and it just is release

00:18:20.719 --> 00:18:27.770
Caption: would earlier this week so perfectly

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:29.630
Caption: timed for this conference if I was

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.700
Caption: looking why I have a little bit of a

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:37.489
Caption: cryptic both each knee was actually

00:18:31.699 --> 00:18:40.159
Caption: Greek for sale and it&#39;s year that

00:18:37.489 --> 00:18:42.469
Caption: comprises a number of components so

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:45.979
Caption: first of all data the data there the

00:18:42.469 --> 00:18:48.559
Caption: data plane so it uses endpoint so it&#39;s a

00:18:45.979 --> 00:18:50.719
Caption: histamine Foxy&#39;s from list as the site

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:56.390
Caption: air proxy and it supports HTTP WonderCon

00:18:50.719 --> 00:19:01.390
Caption: traffic HTTP to traffic popc traffic or

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:05.060
Caption: any other format over tcp itself and

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:06.650
Caption: mutual TLS is is optional if you want

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.850
Caption: all the traffic encrypted between the

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.849
Caption: services absolutely

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.940
Caption: and again we have the control plane this

00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:19.619
Caption: time the control plane is actually

00:19:14.939 --> 00:19:22.019
Caption: comprised of three components so first

00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:25.099
Caption: of all we have a pilot so this handles

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:30.300
Caption: be pushing out our travel policies so

00:19:25.099 --> 00:19:32.640
Caption: what can talk and talk the walls again

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:36.869
Caption: any of the other concerns about routing

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:39.000
Caption: between the various services we never

00:19:36.869 --> 00:19:41.219
Caption: mix it and this is where the policy

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.410
Caption: checks are enforced and also be gathered

00:19:41.219 --> 00:19:45.239
Caption: telemetry so we can we have each of

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:49.170
Caption: these side pairs then send in which data

00:19:45.239 --> 00:19:52.079
Caption: Bakhtiar together did in hipster or for

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:55.190
Caption: using and utilization to agra father so

00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:57.929
Caption: again we have this telemetry gathering i

00:19:55.189 --> 00:20:00.869
Caption: finally see them so again if you&#39;ve

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:03.180
Caption: chosen to do usual TLS citadels

00:20:00.869 --> 00:20:05.099
Caption: is what will actually provide those TNS

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.170
Caption: certs and then authority in the process

00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:08.280
Caption: as well

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.320
Caption: there&#39;s also another component which has

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.460
Caption: come up recently for galley which is

00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:16.109
Caption: intended to validate the user-defined

00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:18.390
Caption: configuration effectively provide an

00:20:16.109 --> 00:20:21.119
Caption: abstraction between SPO and the

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:23.369
Caption: underlying platforms so it could run on

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:26.040
Caption: another platform so know about

00:20:23.369 --> 00:20:27.329
Caption: kubernetes a number of more and that&#39;s

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.549
Caption: actually what the adding provides that

00:20:27.329 --> 00:20:31.648
Caption: abstraction between

00:20:29.548 --> 00:20:35.548
Caption: enter in and how they actually can apply

00:20:31.649 --> 00:20:38.159
Caption: together like yourself what does it

00:20:35.548 --> 00:20:40.678
Caption: Nestle sisters really that&#39;s really

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:42.509
Caption: important to me Tech is cool but how

00:20:40.678 --> 00:20:43.699
Caption: does it allow us to do things that we

00:20:42.509 --> 00:20:47.399
Caption: couldn&#39;t do before

00:20:43.699 --> 00:20:49.709
Caption: in fact Bravo fairly I think testing and

00:20:47.399 --> 00:20:52.769
Caption: production has had a bit of a bad rap

00:20:49.709 --> 00:20:54.449
Caption: over the years but I would say every

00:20:52.769 --> 00:20:56.609
Caption: single person in this room is doing it

00:20:54.449 --> 00:21:00.199
Caption: much and just realize it

00:20:56.609 --> 00:21:04.278
Caption: the trick with it is to do it safely

00:21:00.199 --> 00:21:07.288
Caption: so with these complex adaptive systems

00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:09.559
Caption: it&#39;s not actually very beneficial to

00:21:07.288 --> 00:21:11.998
Caption: prove that in one particular scenario

00:21:09.558 --> 00:21:13.678
Caption: running in your own data center at a

00:21:11.999 --> 00:21:15.359
Caption: particular point in time when people are

00:21:13.678 --> 00:21:16.408
Caption: having a dinner and not a lot of time

00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:19.769
Caption: you&#39;re going to appear like it&#39;s

00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:28.230
Caption: incredibly specific it is impossible to

00:21:19.769 --> 00:21:31.350
Caption: have will actually be reliable this is a

00:21:28.229 --> 00:21:33.418
Caption: very rarely or these micro systems you

00:21:31.349 --> 00:21:35.759
Caption: will inevitably have partial failures

00:21:33.418 --> 00:21:38.099
Caption: but it&#39;s how do you I do identify them

00:21:35.759 --> 00:21:41.489
Caption: and then how do you recover from them as

00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:45.479
Caption: P so it gets probably when you say to

00:21:41.489 --> 00:21:49.009
Caption: test and production statement or really

00:21:45.479 --> 00:21:54.028
Caption: safe is we test our code clueless and

00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:56.279
Caption: tested again in productive and this

00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:58.550
Caption: testing forgotten so like people has

00:21:56.279 --> 00:22:00.650
Caption: evolved massively

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:02.450
Caption: couple of years and this other left we

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:05.690
Caption: we typically have all the things we did

00:22:02.449 --> 00:22:07.849
Caption: before a lot of other techniques so

00:22:05.689 --> 00:22:09.709
Caption: again as you deploy what are certain

00:22:07.849 --> 00:22:12.919
Caption: things that we can do so integration

00:22:09.709 --> 00:22:15.409
Caption: testing you know testing and then also

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.270
Caption: this really interesting one shadowing

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:19.609
Caption: which for me is one of like it&#39;s always

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:24.260
Caption: being this really advanced technique

00:22:19.609 --> 00:22:26.059
Caption: that I could do that but never had the

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:29.599
Caption: infrastructure in place to actually

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:32.600
Caption: enable it so tracking shadowing or

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:36.349
Caption: traffic mirroring so what this allows us

00:22:32.599 --> 00:22:40.130
Caption: to do is if you have virgin-born of a

00:22:36.349 --> 00:22:43.880
Caption: service and any deployed version to what

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:45.829
Caption: if before you have to send any real

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.530
Caption: production traffic to service to you

00:22:45.829 --> 00:22:51.919
Caption: might be a lot of technical work if you

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:54.530
Caption: could mirror or shadow a sample of the

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:57.500
Caption: traffic from service a and duplicated

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:59.119
Caption: through the service be completely off

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.709
Caption: the critical path but then you could

00:22:59.119 --> 00:23:04.430
Caption: actually see how that service will

00:23:00.709 --> 00:23:08.449
Caption: respond in real-time to represent to the

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:09.250
Caption: production track let&#39;s see how that

00:23:08.449 --> 00:23:12.229
Caption: would work

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:14.000
Caption: so again service be maybe a little bit

00:23:12.229 --> 00:23:16.900
Caption: of a risky release we&#39;re not a hundred

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.900
Caption: percent confident with

00:23:17.359 --> 00:23:21.839
Caption: and then we have invoice hunting the

00:23:19.829 --> 00:23:25.558
Caption: egress from this service and the ingress

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:29.699
Caption: into service people what we can then do

00:23:25.558 --> 00:23:32.640
Caption: is shadow all the traffic duplicate the

00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:34.919
Caption: traffic the fact ed boy then we&#39;ll add a

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.320
Caption: shadow&#39; prefix to the host or authority

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:39.570
Caption: heading so that&#39;s the service beacon

00:23:37.319 --> 00:23:40.949
Caption: that identifies this is shadows traffic

00:23:39.569 --> 00:23:42.359
Caption: so if it&#39;s going to call the state you

00:23:40.949 --> 00:23:44.639
Caption: taste it on the back end this is why

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:47.099
Caption: this is basic traffic but what we&#39;ve

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.558
Caption: noted on all the user will still be

00:23:47.099 --> 00:23:51.419
Caption: going from dis blow but without a

00:23:49.558 --> 00:23:53.489
Caption: release team having a huge amount of

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:58.800
Caption: insight into when we actually pick that

00:23:53.489 --> 00:24:02.010
Caption: switch how it will behave this is pre

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.720
Caption: release this is deploy what about then

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:11.820
Caption: when we start to actually want to put

00:24:03.719 --> 00:24:13.199
Caption: production traffic canary releases the

00:24:11.819 --> 00:24:14.639
Caption: origin of this is where there was you

00:24:13.199 --> 00:24:16.619
Caption: know back to the mining days where

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:23.400
Caption: divided people poisonous gases down at

00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:25.410
Caption: the before the person but it&#39;s the same

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.280
Caption: sort of theory from here we want to be

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:31.020
Caption: able to have quick insight or feedback

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:35.429
Caption: into how essential perform reformer

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:37.170
Caption: sending all the traffic into it and

00:24:35.428 --> 00:24:39.149
Caption: again this we can configure this

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:41.309
Caption: incredibly easily so again what we can

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:44.160
Caption: do is through our control plane we can

00:24:41.308 --> 00:24:45.130
Caption: then update the traffic roving policy to

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.800
Caption: that particular sir

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:52.359
Caption: this case was saying let&#39;s tack with 95%

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:56.710
Caption: Co service fee and service be v1 and 5%

00:24:52.359 --> 00:24:59.679
Caption: to v2 over time we can then increase

00:24:56.709 --> 00:25:01.539
Caption: that it&#39;s going to perfection in order

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.000
Caption: to their future to have a have a policy

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:06.609
Caption: that says Stata wouldn&#39;t it and just

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.859
Caption: gradually you automatically increase it

00:25:06.609 --> 00:25:11.709
Caption: over time if you not see barriers

00:25:08.859 --> 00:25:14.380
Caption: that&#39;s why movie that the public this is

00:25:11.709 --> 00:25:16.689
Caption: really the level of automation that is

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:19.030
Caption: for providers trying to do this manually

00:25:16.689 --> 00:25:21.250
Caption: would be an absolute nightmare this

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:28.119
Caption: brings a whole host of capabilities that

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:29.319
Caption: were beyond us before very attainable so

00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:32.280
Caption: as mentioned before what we now

00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:34.209
Caption: completely done is a couple

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.830
Caption: infrastructure scaling so if I have a

00:25:34.209 --> 00:25:39.819
Caption: kubernetes service they&#39;re looking at

00:25:35.829 --> 00:25:42.760
Caption: people to be two deployments that&#39;s fine

00:25:39.819 --> 00:25:44.109
Caption: in theory traffic to go to go be more

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.089
Caption: than seen two simultaneously but I

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:48.489
Caption: thought no delay another traffic

00:25:46.089 --> 00:25:51.309
Caption: management policy over the top of it I

00:25:48.489 --> 00:25:55.050
Caption: don&#39;t have to change my deployments to

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.050
Caption: be able to update and adapt that

00:25:58.819 --> 00:26:04.019
Caption: typically I see that being supported by

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.520
Caption: a platform team it is still sufficiently

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.560
Caption: complicated they provide that you have a

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:12.599
Caption: dedicated team to ensure the smooth

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:15.900
Caption: running of that particular service and

00:26:12.599 --> 00:26:19.349
Caption: as I mentioned before should be able to

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:21.330
Caption: be wrapped with a sidecar across it

00:26:19.349 --> 00:26:25.679
Caption: without the application needing to

00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:28.919
Caption: change your bead you&#39;re aware of it the

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:31.470
Caption: walkways do application service

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:51.690
Caption: developers then need to do where if

00:26:31.469 --> 00:26:52.919
Caption: there&#39;s a mission place at all things so

00:26:51.689 --> 00:26:54.449
Caption: Jake reps which is one of the original

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:59.250
Caption: who&#39;s one of the original architects

00:26:54.449 --> 00:27:00.839
Caption: behind Afghan and he the great term for

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:04.290
Caption: when micro-services press came out back

00:27:00.839 --> 00:27:06.329
Caption: in 2014 and if anybody else kind of

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.100
Caption: items at about ten years ago you might

00:27:06.329 --> 00:27:09.719
Caption: have come across a distributed object so

00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:10.890
Caption: they have this wonderful idea that you

00:27:09.719 --> 00:27:13.949
Caption: have an object which could actually

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:16.160
Caption: result in a remote call but the

00:27:13.949 --> 00:27:18.539
Caption: developer doesn&#39;t need to know about it

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.310
Caption: great idea until you actually start

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.780
Caption: using it where suddenly the performance

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.100
Caption: of the system is terrible because you&#39;re

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.690
Caption: having all of these remote Falls

00:27:23.099 --> 00:27:27.689
Caption: happened but you had no idea the

00:27:24.689 --> 00:27:30.149
Caption: feedback loop around it so I think

00:27:27.689 --> 00:27:31.919
Caption: definitely what it should be aware the

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.900
Caption: other property is there and how it

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.090
Caption: actually been an aggregated telemetry

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.550
Caption: that makes it available absolutely the

00:27:36.089 --> 00:27:39.989
Caption: policy is then again from absolutely

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.160
Caption: part of the application tier but

00:27:39.989 --> 00:27:43.079
Caption: actually then the supporting

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.060
Caption: infrastructure how do you actually scale

00:27:43.079 --> 00:27:47.250
Caption: out that service and make a reliable I

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.810
Caption: see that has to be a specialized skill

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:52.939
Caption: set at least initially within your

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.940
Caption: organization to make sure that it seems

00:27:53.329 --> 00:27:57.119
Caption: so question then so we&#39;ve covered a

00:27:56.099 --> 00:27:58.500
Caption: little bit about Service Master

00:27:57.119 --> 00:28:01.709
Caption: Craftsmen itself and then a particular

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:03.810
Caption: implementation to this deal how would we

00:28:01.709 --> 00:28:07.109
Caption: go about introducing one into your

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:11.880
Caption: architecture and again a trek movie

00:28:07.109 --> 00:28:15.719
Caption: movie has some insight for us and it&#39;s

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.699
Caption: typically around the hype around service

00:28:15.719 --> 00:28:20.909
Caption: missions no he actually sees that only

00:28:17.699 --> 00:28:23.250
Caption: one thing brings down service mesh it

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:26.660
Caption: will be unrealistic expectations put

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:26.660
Caption: around the profit circle song

00:28:29.329 --> 00:28:33.589
Caption: if you have a local services

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:35.690
Caption: architecture all requiring the operating

00:28:33.589 --> 00:28:38.538
Caption: cost or passive ownership of your

00:28:35.689 --> 00:28:41.868
Caption: services is high or you&#39;re not having

00:28:38.538 --> 00:28:43.908
Caption: the ability to release quickly and take

00:28:41.869 --> 00:28:46.629
Caption: advantage of a number of capabilities

00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:49.090
Caption: such as canary releases such as

00:28:46.629 --> 00:28:51.229
Caption: mirroring

00:28:49.089 --> 00:28:54.829
Caption: absolutely do provide a lot of value

00:28:51.229 --> 00:28:57.229
Caption: head start with a single capability

00:28:54.829 --> 00:29:00.168
Caption: don&#39;t try to roll everything eats the

00:28:57.229 --> 00:29:03.139
Caption: fish again instrumentation is generally

00:29:00.168 --> 00:29:04.548
Caption: movements backward instrumentation is

00:29:03.139 --> 00:29:06.049
Caption: really stable States about any

00:29:04.548 --> 00:29:08.028
Caption: distributed system or in fact any

00:29:06.048 --> 00:29:10.219
Caption: product steep will stop at what provides

00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:12.470
Caption: the feedback to identity the river

00:29:10.219 --> 00:29:14.808
Caption: descended so again remember with DevOps

00:29:12.469 --> 00:29:16.879
Caption: and again having a culture of continuous

00:29:14.808 --> 00:29:18.469
Caption: learning continuous learning and

00:29:16.879 --> 00:29:26.889
Caption: improvement is only possible but you

00:29:18.469 --> 00:29:30.398
Caption: could base it on the city&#39;s office the

00:29:26.889 --> 00:29:30.399
Caption: critical path as well

00:29:37.619 --> 00:29:44.520
Caption: so what we thought a servicemen

00:29:41.729 --> 00:29:49.929
Caption: dedication in okay there to make

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:52.209
Caption: inter-service communication reliable if

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:54.670
Caption: you are facing phones around the

00:29:52.209 --> 00:29:59.709
Caption: operability on you micro-services fleet

00:29:54.670 --> 00:30:01.480
Caption: a service mission help and most

00:29:59.709 --> 00:30:05.739
Caption: importantly service members aboard

00:30:01.479 --> 00:30:08.140
Caption: gradual adoption take advantage on the

00:30:05.739 --> 00:30:10.780
Caption: stack with a single use case prove that

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:16.930
Caption: it works engages think boulders so what

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:18.640
Caption: is demonstrated value for office I&#39;ve

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:20.440
Caption: been talking for about 35 minutes now

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:22.500
Caption: that leaves us about 10 minutes for

00:30:20.439 --> 00:30:22.500
Caption: questions

00:30:38.849 --> 00:30:49.169
Caption: yep one-to-one communication but

00:30:46.719 --> 00:31:01.049
Caption: [Music]

00:30:49.170 --> 00:31:01.050
Caption: necessity how in messaging architectures

00:31:02.219 --> 00:31:07.099
Caption: so a lot of what I discussed today ease

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:11.150
Caption: of optimizing

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:12.918
Caption: or PC which is very much one parent but

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.440
Caption: probably why the discussion around

00:31:12.918 --> 00:31:18.319
Caption: distributed systems

00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:19.548
Caption: so with site carriers there&#39;s a couple

00:31:18.319 --> 00:31:21.199
Caption: of initial progress that are coming up

00:31:19.548 --> 00:31:24.349
Caption: now to say well how do we actually adopt

00:31:21.199 --> 00:31:25.880
Caption: the same level of thinking to mrs.

00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:28.250
Caption: brimmer&#39;s my protection whereby you

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.979
Caption: could have each one unlike baby broker

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.928
Caption: route the route of egress and again each

00:31:30.979 --> 00:31:35.298
Caption: one of those consumers but there&#39;s

00:31:32.928 --> 00:31:37.189
Caption: nothing in production that I&#39;m aware all

00:31:35.298 --> 00:31:39.229
Caption: you know in the community that&#39;s

00:31:37.189 --> 00:31:42.109
Caption: actively being developed around it sort

00:31:39.229 --> 00:31:45.229
Caption: of side care service mesh approach for

00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:47.658
Caption: those async message flows so really

00:31:45.229 --> 00:31:51.349
Caption: service measures to date are about

00:31:47.659 --> 00:31:53.630
Caption: optimizing the organ see flow but at the

00:31:51.349 --> 00:31:56.808
Caption: same time just because you have one part

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:58.940
Caption: of the assistant that works in a request

00:31:56.808 --> 00:32:01.279
Caption: response I&#39;ll ask a question I wait for

00:31:58.939 --> 00:32:03.949
Caption: the answer does not mean in any way that

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:06.020
Caption: the entire system needs to be absolutely

00:32:03.949 --> 00:32:07.939
Caption: I could still have for instance a

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:10.308
Caption: front-end calling that additional

00:32:07.939 --> 00:32:12.589
Caption: service they could absolutely raise just

00:32:10.308 --> 00:32:14.750
Caption: a number of topics and then that could

00:32:12.589 --> 00:32:16.400
Caption: result in a whole number of operations

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:17.839
Caption: generated which could then be persisted

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.280
Caption: in the database so there&#39;s a baby after

00:32:17.839 --> 00:32:20.510
Caption: swipe on the millisecond that service

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.090
Caption: just reads the generation all the

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:25.640
Caption: reasons so there definitely won&#39;t mean

00:32:23.089 --> 00:32:28.989
Caption: look at these systems it&#39;s a mixing and

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.989
Caption: matching at the same whether I said

00:32:29.069 --> 00:32:35.619
Caption: or again if it&#39;s gonna be a so like

00:32:32.829 --> 00:32:37.929
Caption: respect as well so you could definitely

00:32:35.619 --> 00:32:39.699
Caption: consider this as ain&#39;t no the very

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:42.160
Caption: valuable tool to have in your toolbox

00:32:39.699 --> 00:32:45.389
Caption: but not necessarily you know the one way

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.390

Caption: brought up really good points about you

00:32:59.229 --> 00:33:05.260
Caption: need some expert on this stuff because

00:33:01.089 --> 00:33:06.909
Caption: it is work to maintain diversity of line

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:10.739
Caption: I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;ve had any

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:16.800
Caption: experience of the interaction between

00:33:10.739 --> 00:33:19.119
Caption: traffic shaping the the auto scaling and

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:21.070
Caption: kubernetes deployments as is this

00:33:19.119 --> 00:33:25.059
Caption: traffic shaping Effingham service level

00:33:21.069 --> 00:33:27.189
Caption: is happening in the vehicle questions so

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:29.140
Caption: that the traffic shake will happen asked

00:33:27.189 --> 00:33:31.479
Caption: the cognitive so every layer 7 within

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:34.119
Caption: the application itself but then based on

00:33:31.479 --> 00:33:36.429
Caption: the policies that will be sent from the

00:33:34.119 --> 00:33:37.890
Caption: service itself and if I do actually have

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:48.330
Caption: a copy difficult

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:50.959
Caption: you can actually brought beside Paris so

00:33:48.329 --> 00:33:53.089
Caption: this is how you might actually deploy

00:33:50.959 --> 00:33:56.039
Caption: [Music]

00:33:53.089 --> 00:33:57.510
Caption: all of the sides actually within the

00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:00.989
Caption: posture themselves you can actually roll

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:03.869
Caption: it this is what we do then is the JB

00:34:00.989 --> 00:34:05.369
Caption: Evans got like pretty heavy footprint so

00:34:03.869 --> 00:34:07.859
Caption: again to prevent you know having a

00:34:05.369 --> 00:34:10.139
Caption: couple of different problems within

00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:12.810
Caption: consume a lot of resources we then put

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:16.519
Caption: that up to be once per host but again

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:16.520
Caption: still controlling ingress/egress

00:34:24.939 --> 00:34:28.089
Caption: [Music]

00:35:16.639 --> 00:35:28.169

Caption: this entire Police of Services is the

00:37:44.159 --> 00:37:50.459
Caption: problem and only there would be further
