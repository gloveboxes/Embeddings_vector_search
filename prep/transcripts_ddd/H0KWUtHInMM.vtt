Caption: creating great workplace environments

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.959
Caption: and building awesome teams I believe

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.090
Caption: that all of us deserve to work somewhere

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:05.088
Caption: where we feel valued and empowered and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.489
Caption: for me this belief came from growing up

00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:11.269
Caption: in a cult where I didn&#39;t have a lot of

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:14.508
Caption: freedom and empowerment and I was also a

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:16.898
Caption: victim of domestic violence at 18 and

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.310
Caption: over the years I&#39;ve had three near-death

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.708
Caption: experiences and all of these things have

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:24.108
Caption: really common ated for me in the belief

00:01:21.708 --> 00:01:25.519
Caption: that life is too short to go to work

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.049
Caption: every day and do something that you

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:29.599
Caption: don&#39;t love and that you&#39;re not

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.719
Caption: passionate about so I try and make every

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:31.719
Caption: day count

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.689
Caption: I&#39;ve worked with a lot of senior

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.270
Caption: developers and team leads over the years

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.490
Caption: and when I was thinking about putting

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:41.928
Caption: this talk together I was thinking about

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:43.548
Caption: what are the kinds of questions that

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:47.179
Caption: they ask me and what are the things that

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.279
Caption: they are challenged with the most and

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.499
Caption: the first one was how do you get

00:01:49.278 --> 00:01:52.579
Caption: interviewing right you know how do you

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:54.439
Caption: make sure you don&#39;t bring the wrong

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.208
Caption: people into your team because there&#39;s a

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.799
Caption: big fear that you have this great team

00:01:56.208 --> 00:02:00.289
Caption: and you don&#39;t want to ruin it by getting

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.700
Caption: the wrong people the other questions

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.399
Caption: that I&#39;ve heard them heard a lot about

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:06.379
Caption: is how do you handle those difficult

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.419
Caption: conversations if you&#39;ve got someone

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:10.250
Caption: who&#39;s maybe not performing or there&#39;s

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.050
Caption: some challenges within the team you know

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.009
Caption: how do you handle those conversations as

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.449
Caption: easily and painlessly as possible so in

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.949
Caption: this talk today I&#39;m going to run you

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:21.110
Caption: through the life cycle

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:23.750
Caption: of building growing and nourishing a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.488
Caption: high-performing team and I&#39;m gonna share

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.768
Caption: what I&#39;ve learned over the many years

00:02:25.488 --> 00:02:29.690
Caption: and hopefully some easy strategies in

00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:31.699
Caption: the hope that all of us can create

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.660
Caption: amazing workplace environments where our

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.660
Caption: teams can succeed

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.790
Caption: starting with build if you&#39;re in here

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.699
Caption: today you already have some sort of team

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:45.348
Caption: and whether that&#39;s two of you five of

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:49.220
Caption: you or a hundred of you there&#39;s already

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:51.440
Caption: gonna be an existing culture in place to

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.119
Caption: build a solid foundation the three areas

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.018
Caption: that we&#39;re going to look at our values

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:58.369
Caption: vision and engagement strategy and I

00:02:57.018 --> 00:03:00.380
Caption: guess I just want to clarify when I say

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:02.059
Caption: engagement strategy don&#39;t freak out it&#39;s

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.860
Caption: not going to be all hate sorry it&#39;s

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:05.630
Caption: gonna be practical things that as a team

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.589
Caption: leader or a senior developer you can do

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.958
Caption: with your team so culture is made up of

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:13.369
Caption: the beliefs values and behaviors that

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.110
Caption: are shared and demonstrated across the

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:18.229
Caption: organization I&#39;ve heard lots of

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.819
Caption: different lots of different explanations

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.509
Caption: over the years but that&#39;s the one that I

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.309
Caption: like the most

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:25.000
Caption: it&#39;s what&#39;s actually demonstrated in

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:27.858
Caption: your organization and in your team and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.979
Caption: values can be organization based or they

00:03:27.858 --> 00:03:33.048
Caption: can just be team based it depends on how

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:36.529
Caption: clear your values are and how big your

00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:38.690
Caption: organization is if your organization has

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:40.518
Caption: high level values you need to really

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.779
Caption: make sure that they&#39;re broken down so

00:03:40.518 --> 00:03:44.179
Caption: that they&#39;re meaningful for your team

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:45.470
Caption: and if your organization doesn&#39;t have

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.750
Caption: clear values then you need to

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.750
Caption: collaboratively create the values with

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.548
Caption: your team once you&#39;ve got these values

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.119
Caption: you can then recognize and reward

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:57.828
Caption: individuals and teams based on those

00:03:56.119 --> 00:04:03.470
Caption: behaviors that are really driving and

00:03:57.828 --> 00:04:07.129
Caption: encouraging the culture why do you go to

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.190
Caption: work every day why do your team members

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.650
Caption: go to work every day do you know what

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.470
Caption: they&#39;re trying to achieve do they know

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:17.929
Caption: what they&#39;re trying to achieve it can be

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.729
Caption: really hard to answer that question but

00:04:17.929 --> 00:04:22.250
Caption: it&#39;s really important that people have a

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.750
Caption: clear purpose and understand why they&#39;re

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.209
Caption: coming to work every day and what

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.369
Caption: they&#39;re doing so if there&#39;s a high-level

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:30.949
Caption: company vision which there often is as a

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:32.540
Caption: as a team lead we need to really break

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.390
Caption: that down for our team so that

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.730
Caption: meaningful and relevant and then once

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.830
Caption: we&#39;ve got that clear vision you want to

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.589
Caption: go even further and really break it down

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:45.439
Caption: into clear goals so everybody knows what

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:49.820
Caption: equals success for me in my role and for

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.799
Caption: a team what equals success one of my

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.080
Caption: favorite books which I bang on about

00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:56.479
Caption: every time I talk is how to find your Y

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:58.519
Caption: by simon Sinek and if you haven&#39;t read

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.140
Caption: it I definitely recommend it it really

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:01.879
Caption: talks you through a step-by-step process

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.040
Caption: of how you figure out what that purpose

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.809
Caption: is and it also talks you through a

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.640
Caption: process you can do with your team to

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:10.000
Caption: collaboratively figure out what your

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.430
Caption: team purpose is which is really cool

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.869
Caption: another one is drive by Dan pink he

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:18.399
Caption: talks there&#39;s got to be a whole section

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:23.089
Caption: around purpose and why it&#39;s so important

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:25.160
Caption: so engagement strategy as well as a team

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:28.519
Caption: lead or even as a senior developer you

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.140
Caption: know it&#39;s it&#39;s our job to make sure that

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:31.970
Caption: there&#39;s a plan of how we&#39;re going to

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.470
Caption: engage our team because if we fail to

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.329
Caption: plan we plan to fail so I&#39;m not talking

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.190
Caption: anything hardcore I&#39;m just talking a

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:41.569
Caption: one-pager with a few bullet points of

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.970
Caption: the key areas that you&#39;re going to focus

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.149
Caption: on we&#39;ve already talked about values of

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.440
Caption: vision which are two of the key areas

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:50.479
Caption: for the engagement strategy you also

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.260
Caption: need to look at collaboration and

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.029
Caption: communication so sorry collaboration and

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.619
Caption: connection will cover communication

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:01.489
Caption: leader it&#39;s human nature to really want

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:04.100
Caption: collaboration and connection with other

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:05.959
Caption: people so as a leader it&#39;s our job to

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.570
Caption: create those opportunities for our teams

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:10.669
Caption: to connect and to collaborate and to put

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.490
Caption: a cadence in place where there&#39;s regular

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.830
Caption: events and regular sessions so that our

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:17.539
Caption: teams can do that I&#39;m going to run

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:20.869
Caption: through a specific example of how to do

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.510
Caption: this in the next slide the other area is

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:25.429
Caption: communication and transparency people

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.520
Caption: want regular and transparent

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:30.139
Caption: communication so once again as the

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:33.109
Caption: leader it&#39;s our job to create different

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.910
Caption: methods that tailor to different styles

00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:36.889
Caption: so you need to understand who&#39;s in your

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.660
Caption: team what their different preferred

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.340
Caption: communication styles are and how you&#39;re

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.809
Caption: going to tailor those comms to really

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:46.850
Caption: suit everybody in your team and then the

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:48.529
Caption: third one is reward and

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.529
Caption: how do you show you people that they

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:54.139
Caption: valued in your team obviously saying

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:55.220
Caption: thank you is a nice way to do it and I&#39;m

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.720
Caption: pretty easy

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.389
Caption: the studies show you that you know you

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.369
Caption: need 8 to 1 ratio so eight pieces of

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.199
Caption: positive reinforcement and thank you

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:06.410
Caption: before they actually listen and it sinks

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:08.509
Caption: in so I think nothing ever beats verbal

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.699
Caption: praise there&#39;s plenty of other options

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:11.959
Caption: though Yama has a praise feature which

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:14.779
Caption: is fantastic

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:16.970
Caption: LinkedIn has the new kudos feature which

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:19.369
Caption: I&#39;m on the fence about but it&#39;s still an

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.589
Caption: option there&#39;s a lot of specific

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:23.119
Caption: recognition apps and recognition walls

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:26.510
Caption: that you can implement in your company

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:28.279
Caption: as well and then there&#39;s awards so you

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.260
Caption: know monthly or quarterly an annual

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:33.889
Caption: award within your team is a great way to

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:36.289
Caption: reward and recognize and then rewards as

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:38.330
Caption: well everybody loves a good voucher or

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.630
Caption: you know movie tickets or something like

00:07:38.329 --> 00:07:41.209
Caption: that

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.279
Caption: and reward and recognition doesn&#39;t have

00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:47.359
Caption: to be expensive the first implementation

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:50.029
Caption: that I did I had no budget so we created

00:07:47.359 --> 00:07:52.279
Caption: a living the values awards program and

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:54.739
Caption: so every month peers would nominate each

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:56.989
Caption: other for displaying the the values of

00:07:54.739 --> 00:07:59.059
Caption: the company and we would select a couple

00:07:56.989 --> 00:08:01.339
Caption: of winners and we&#39;d print out an a4

00:07:59.059 --> 00:08:03.589
Caption: certificate and put it in a frame you

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:06.348
Caption: know it wasn&#39;t you know costs maybe five

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:08.000
Caption: dollars but a year later I&#39;d be walking

00:08:06.348 --> 00:08:10.250
Caption: around the office and I&#39;d see people

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.559
Caption: with these frames on their desk still

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:17.299
Caption: sorry it may sound a little bit you know

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:19.519
Caption: silly but it means a lot to people so

00:08:17.299 --> 00:08:21.769
Caption: here&#39;s just a really easy example of

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:23.690
Caption: what I&#39;m talking about as a leader you

00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:25.879
Caption: don&#39;t need to be the one to do all of

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.979
Caption: these things but it is our job to set a

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.679
Caption: plan and to make sure that these things

00:08:27.979 --> 00:08:32.028
Caption: happen so this is an example of some of

00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:33.528
Caption: the things that I&#39;ve done in previous

00:08:32.028 --> 00:08:34.880
Caption: organizations that has worked really

00:08:33.528 --> 00:08:38.929
Caption: well to make sure that we&#39;re bringing

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:40.309
Caption: people together and the slides will be

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:43.070
Caption: available later so you don&#39;t have to

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:44.419
Caption: take a photo communication wise once

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.100
Caption: again you know what types of

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:47.929
Caption: communication methods are you going to

00:08:46.099 --> 00:08:49.458
Caption: do and how often are you&#39;re going to do

00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:50.838
Caption: them you don&#39;t have to be the one to

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:55.909
Caption: implement them but you need to make sure

00:08:50.838 --> 00:08:57.260
Caption: that it&#39;s happening and communications

00:08:55.909 --> 00:08:59.149
Caption: channel this is what I found challenging

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.229
Caption: the bigger company the bigger the

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.400
Caption: company is we

00:09:00.229 --> 00:09:05.599
Caption: you go to find out certain types of coms

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.130
Caption: because every company is different right

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:09.079
Caption: and sometimes you just don&#39;t even know

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.780
Caption: where to start or where to go so having

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.980
Caption: a clear cadence like that and to tell

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.570
Caption: people where to go especially when

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:20.239
Caption: you&#39;re onboarding new people is really

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:21.739
Caption: helpful and recognition programs are in

00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:23.359
Caption: that recognition wall like I said a

00:09:21.739 --> 00:09:26.779
Caption: visible place where people can recognize

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:28.369
Caption: and show gratitude I actually this is

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.020
Caption: one that I&#39;ve put a team together and

00:09:28.369 --> 00:09:33.679
Caption: created because we couldn&#39;t find one

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:36.350
Caption: that suited our purpose so you know just

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:38.149
Caption: a place where people can say thanks to

00:09:36.349 --> 00:09:40.509
Caption: each other and create that culture of

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:43.160
Caption: gratitude the levels of mental stress

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.780
Caption: mental health and stress are just rising

00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:46.639
Caption: and rising and rising so there&#39;s plenty

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.670
Caption: of studies that show you these cultures

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:53.929
Caption: of gratitude really help help people and

00:09:49.669 --> 00:09:55.579
Caption: your organization so now you want to

00:09:53.929 --> 00:09:57.710
Caption: grow your team you&#39;ve got you know got a

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.270
Caption: nice foundational culture the last thing

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.160
Caption: you do is want to hire people that don&#39;t

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:04.369
Caption: either have the skills or don&#39;t fit into

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:06.049
Caption: the culture of your organization and the

00:10:04.369 --> 00:10:08.179
Caption: first thing that I want to address is

00:10:06.049 --> 00:10:09.529
Caption: fitting into the culture it&#39;s really

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:12.289
Caption: important that we change the language

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.670
Caption: about this we should be looking for

00:10:12.289 --> 00:10:15.829
Caption: people who are going to enhance our

00:10:13.669 --> 00:10:18.079
Caption: culture so culture add as opposed to

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:20.030
Caption: culture fit because culture is always

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.980
Caption: changing and more thing it never ever

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.240
Caption: stays the same so we don&#39;t want people

00:10:21.979 --> 00:10:26.179
Caption: that are going to fit we want people

00:10:23.239 --> 00:10:28.729
Caption: that are going to add as a team leader a

00:10:26.179 --> 00:10:30.649
Caption: senior team member you have different

00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:32.869
Caption: levels of influence around this process

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:35.450
Caption: but three of the areas that I think you

00:10:32.869 --> 00:10:38.770
Caption: can make a difference in is where to

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:41.150
Caption: find and and how to get great talent

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.980
Caption: interviews so often you&#39;ll be asked to

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.840
Caption: be part of the technical interview

00:10:42.979 --> 00:10:47.779
Caption: process or come up with what that looks

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.220
Caption: like and also what questions you ask in

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:53.090
Caption: your interview when you&#39;re interviewing

00:10:49.219 --> 00:10:54.649
Caption: to assess that culture ad and then the

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.630
Caption: third area is contributing to your

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.230
Caption: employer brand to help attract the right

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.229
Caption: talent as well

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.309
Caption: does anybody here find it really easy to

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:09.950
Caption: find great technical talent excellent

00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:12.229
Caption: I&#39;m not alone couple verify yeah

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:15.230
Caption: whatever

00:11:12.229 --> 00:11:17.389
Caption: most of us find it really hard right so

00:11:15.229 --> 00:11:19.130
Caption: some of the things that you can do is

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.049
Caption: help your recruiters if you&#39;ve got

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.760
Caption: internal recruitment if you don&#39;t have

00:11:21.049 --> 00:11:24.559
Caption: into recruitment then you&#39;ll probably be

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.869
Caption: using an agency but you can still help

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:30.049
Caption: them as well but if you&#39;ve got your

00:11:26.869 --> 00:11:32.479
Caption: internal recruiters you know tell them

00:11:30.049 --> 00:11:34.070
Caption: where they can find these people just

00:11:32.479 --> 00:11:35.959
Caption: give them idea of what kind of companies

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.309
Caption: they should be targeting you know what

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.410
Caption: kind of meetups that they should go to

00:11:37.309 --> 00:11:41.150
Caption: what type of conferences like this that

00:11:39.409 --> 00:11:42.849
Caption: they should be at give them some of that

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.809
Caption: information that they might not have

00:11:42.849 --> 00:11:48.380
Caption: encouraged your company the sponsor

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:50.869
Caption: events like this as well and social

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.460
Caption: media you know promote your people

00:11:50.869 --> 00:11:54.739
Caption: promote your team promote the type of

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.090
Caption: projects that you&#39;re doing that is a way

00:11:54.739 --> 00:11:58.369
Caption: that you get people to notice your

00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:01.220
Caption: organization and to be attracted to come

00:11:58.369 --> 00:12:03.109
Caption: and work for your organization LinkedIn

00:12:01.219 --> 00:12:05.089
Caption: groups as well or reddit groups there&#39;s

00:12:03.109 --> 00:12:07.130
Caption: so many different platforms that

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:09.050
Caption: recruiters don&#39;t really know about so as

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.820
Caption: a technical person you&#39;re in the know

00:12:09.049 --> 00:12:11.959
Caption: you know where all these people are and

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.669
Caption: where they&#39;re going so give you a

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:17.450
Caption: recruiter those tips and help them out a

00:12:13.669 --> 00:12:19.729
Caption: little the most successful teams that

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:22.880
Caption: I&#39;ve ever worked in we&#39;ve had a referral

00:12:19.729 --> 00:12:24.440
Caption: percentage of 70% out of all hires so

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.900
Caption: ideally you want to be driving your

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.088
Caption: internal referral program and really

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:30.619
Caption: encouraging people to refer their

00:12:29.088 --> 00:12:32.209
Caption: friends because if it is a great culture

00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:33.349
Caption: and a great place to work they&#39;re gonna

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.290
Caption: want their friends to come and work with

00:12:33.349 --> 00:12:38.359
Caption: you so feeding into technical

00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:41.359
Caption: requirements for job adverts is the

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:43.880
Caption: other area if you&#39;re looking for a

00:12:41.359 --> 00:12:45.320
Caption: full-stack developer for example you

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.849
Caption: know think about what kind of skills

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.289
Caption: that you&#39;re going to come up with

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:50.119
Caption: generally you&#39;re going to be asked to

00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:52.059
Caption: put together a bullet point list of all

00:12:50.119 --> 00:12:55.219
Caption: the essential skills that they must have

00:12:52.059 --> 00:12:56.539
Caption: and when I think about all the bullet

00:12:55.219 --> 00:12:58.279
Caption: points that I&#39;ve seen on adverts

00:12:56.539 --> 00:13:00.859
Caption: normally there&#39;s anywhere from seven to

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:03.290
Caption: twelve bullet points of all the things

00:13:00.859 --> 00:13:06.729
Caption: that you need to have to apply for that

00:13:03.289 --> 00:13:08.838
Caption: job and what I would say is less is more

00:13:06.729 --> 00:13:11.179
Caption: every single bullet point you put in

00:13:08.838 --> 00:13:13.279
Caption: your advert is basically creating an

00:13:11.179 --> 00:13:16.099
Caption: objection and potentially stopping

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.540
Caption: someone from applying to that ad good

00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:19.159
Caption: people know what they do a full-stack

00:13:17.539 --> 00:13:21.049
Caption: developers know what they do right they

00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:23.479
Caption: know what skills they need to have so

00:13:21.049 --> 00:13:25.130
Caption: use an advert as an opportunity to sell

00:13:23.479 --> 00:13:27.260
Caption: your organization not to

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:32.780
Caption: tell people what they should have when

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:34.309
Caption: they already know that and good people

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.900
Caption: can work anywhere right there they&#39;re

00:13:34.309 --> 00:13:38.270
Caption: weighing you up with another six or

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.770
Caption: seven different companies so use it to

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.570
Caption: really sell all of the benefits that

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:44.869
Caption: your company has and list them all out

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:47.299
Caption: on your advert also use a tool like

00:13:44.869 --> 00:13:48.859
Caption: Texas do for a gender-neutral wording

00:13:47.299 --> 00:13:50.390
Caption: and it will give you it&#39;ll just scan ear

00:13:48.859 --> 00:13:52.609
Caption: advert will give you a bit of a report

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.380
Caption: on how where it&#39;s at if there&#39;s anything

00:13:52.609 --> 00:13:55.849
Caption: you need to need to change because once

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.470
Caption: again you don&#39;t want to create

00:13:55.849 --> 00:14:02.239
Caption: objections you want as many people as

00:13:57.469 --> 00:14:03.349
Caption: possible to apply so here&#39;s a bit of an

00:14:02.239 --> 00:14:06.260
Caption: example of the way that I would

00:14:03.349 --> 00:14:08.750
Caption: recommend structuring an advert the

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:11.210
Caption: first one is about your company but not

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:14.239
Caption: you know we&#39;ve been around for 15 years

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:17.210
Caption: or not the blah blahs what&#39;s the purpose

00:14:14.239 --> 00:14:19.279
Caption: who do you add value to who do you help

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.809
Caption: what kind of customers do you help and

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.060
Caption: how do you change people&#39;s lives whether

00:14:20.809 --> 00:14:24.559
Caption: it be customers of society if you&#39;re a

00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:27.200
Caption: company you&#39;ve got to have a purpose and

00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:29.150
Caption: a vision so really sell that because

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:33.559
Caption: that&#39;s what people are interested in how

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:35.630
Caption: will we adding value and then exactly

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:37.640
Caption: that how will we adding value in the

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:39.380
Caption: role that I&#39;m gonna join what will I be

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.960
Caption: doing how will I contribute to your team

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:44.510
Caption: so once again rather than focusing on

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.760
Caption: the blah blahs talk about how you can

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:49.970
Caption: help us this is what we&#39;re looking for

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.109
Caption: and then like I said if you have to have

00:14:49.969 --> 00:14:53.449
Caption: your bullet points but you actually

00:14:51.109 --> 00:14:56.869
Caption: don&#39;t have to one of the best ads I ever

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:59.359
Caption: wrote was to two paragraphs I had no

00:14:56.869 --> 00:15:00.799
Caption: bullet points my boss absolutely hated

Caption: worst advert I&#39;ve ever seen in my life

Caption: and I hired one of the best candidates

00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:10.489
Caption: I&#39;ve ever hired from Island who saw that

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.750
Caption: ad and applied to that ad so you don&#39;t

00:15:10.489 --> 00:15:13.700
Caption: need to have bullet points but if you

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:17.630
Caption: have to try and keep it to a maximum of

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:19.970
Caption: three and then once again use it as a

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.549
Caption: cell use it as an actual advert to sell

00:15:19.969 --> 00:15:24.500
Caption: all of the benefits that you have

00:15:21.549 --> 00:15:26.869
Caption: because you know a lot of the time you

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.809

00:15:38.898 --> 00:15:42.018

Caption: you won&#39;t you won&#39;t even realize some of

00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:53.359
Caption: the things that other companies don&#39;t do

00:15:47.229 --> 00:15:56.928
Caption: and then people provide an opportunity

00:15:53.359 --> 00:15:59.508
Caption: for someone to call someone crazy or

00:15:56.929 --> 00:16:01.850
Caption: email someone rather than just having

00:15:59.508 --> 00:16:03.528
Caption: you know a I scan through and spit out

00:16:01.849 --> 00:16:06.618
Caption: who&#39;s suitable and who&#39;s not suitable

00:16:03.528 --> 00:16:08.869

Caption: Perth market right everyone&#39;s always a

00:16:08.869 --> 00:16:12.110
Caption: bit concern that their employer might

00:16:10.638 --> 00:16:13.878
Caption: find out that they&#39;re applying for

00:16:12.109 --> 00:16:15.289
Caption: another job so sometimes they&#39;re gonna

00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:17.119
Caption: want to have a confidential chat with

00:16:15.289 --> 00:16:19.849
Caption: someone so give them that option on your

00:16:17.119 --> 00:16:23.899
Caption: advert I know it&#39;s a little crazy but it

00:16:19.849 --> 00:16:24.888
Caption: really works and then interviewing so

00:16:23.898 --> 00:16:26.359
Caption: hopefully you&#39;ve got some decent

00:16:24.888 --> 00:16:27.528
Caption: candidates in your pipeline by this

00:16:26.359 --> 00:16:31.159
Caption: point through all the different things

00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:32.568
Caption: that we&#39;ve done over the years I was

00:16:31.159 --> 00:16:36.859
Caption: doing a bit of a calculation I think

00:16:32.568 --> 00:16:38.838
Caption: I&#39;ve done over 3,000 interviews and this

00:16:36.859 --> 00:16:39.888
Caption: is some of the feedback this is based on

00:16:38.838 --> 00:16:42.849
Caption: some of the feedback that I&#39;ve collected

00:16:39.888 --> 00:16:45.349
Caption: from candidates and from hiring managers

00:16:42.849 --> 00:16:47.748
Caption: the first one is to make your interview

00:16:45.349 --> 00:16:50.479
Caption: process streamlined so try and keep it

00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:52.459
Caption: between two and four interviews or two

00:16:50.479 --> 00:16:53.838
Caption: and four processes and be really

00:16:52.458 --> 00:16:55.518
Caption: transparent with the candidates at the

00:16:53.838 --> 00:16:57.078
Caption: beginning of this is what it&#39;s going to

00:16:55.518 --> 00:16:58.518
Caption: be this is how many interviews you&#39;re

00:16:57.078 --> 00:16:59.659
Caption: going to have these are the type of

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:01.818
Caption: people that you&#39;re going to be meeting

00:16:59.659 --> 00:17:04.369
Caption: try and be as straightforward and as

00:17:01.818 --> 00:17:06.349
Caption: open as possible with them and sometimes

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:07.760
Caption: if you think it might change just tell

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:11.778
Caption: them that just be transparent and

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:13.099
Caption: upfront at the beginning consistent you

00:17:11.779 --> 00:17:14.539
Caption: want to be comparing apples with apples

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.918
Caption: you know if you&#39;re recruiting for don&#39;t

00:17:14.538 --> 00:17:17.509
Caption: net developers then you want to make

00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:19.188
Caption: sure that the questions or that the

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:22.159
Caption: tests that you have that the process is

00:17:19.188 --> 00:17:23.808
Caption: the same because that&#39;s from a fairness

00:17:22.159 --> 00:17:27.350
Caption: perspective that is the best way to do

00:17:23.808 --> 00:17:30.648
Caption: it relevant if it&#39;s a development role

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:33.079
Caption: then you want to be testing their coding

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:35.239
Caption: skills right if it&#39;s the pre-sales role

00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:38.359
Caption: then you want to be testing their

00:17:35.239 --> 00:17:40.399
Caption: precise ability or facilitation ability

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:41.928
Caption: if it&#39;s for UX so make sure that it&#39;s

00:17:40.399 --> 00:17:43.520
Caption: really relevant to the role that you&#39;re

00:17:41.928 --> 00:17:47.538
Caption: recruiting for don&#39;t just have a blanket

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:49.429
Caption: standard process make sure that

00:17:47.538 --> 00:17:50.869
Caption: subjective so the only way you can be

00:17:49.428 --> 00:17:52.609
Caption: objective is to provide your

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:54.678
Caption: interviewers with training so

00:17:52.609 --> 00:17:57.739
Caption: rather than with training on how to

00:17:54.678 --> 00:17:59.390
Caption: assess people what equals pass what

00:17:57.739 --> 00:18:02.298
Caption: equals fail what do you do if you&#39;re on

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:04.010
Caption: the fence train them on how to use

00:18:02.298 --> 00:18:06.260
Caption: behavioral questions behavioral

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:08.599
Caption: questions are really important and we&#39;ll

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.739
Caption: give some examples of them shortly give

00:18:08.599 --> 00:18:12.169
Caption: them training on unconscious bias

00:18:09.739 --> 00:18:14.058
Caption: because we all have it it&#39;s not it&#39;s not

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:17.989
Caption: whether we do or don&#39;t it&#39;s just about

00:18:14.058 --> 00:18:19.640
Caption: how we&#39;re our way of what it is and the

00:18:17.989 --> 00:18:20.928
Caption: last one is around diversity of

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.130
Caption: interviewers make sure that when you&#39;re

00:18:20.928 --> 00:18:24.558
Caption: putting your interviewers together

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:27.650
Caption: you&#39;ve got a level of diversity there I

00:18:24.558 --> 00:18:29.750
Caption: did a management round interview a few

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.429
Caption: months ago and the recruiter and I

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:34.910
Caption: realized that we&#39;d put a technical

00:18:31.428 --> 00:18:37.489
Caption: interview together and we&#39;d it was a guy

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:39.260
Caption: who was you know in his late 30s early

00:18:37.489 --> 00:18:40.520
Caption: 40s I&#39;m really bad with age so I don&#39;t

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.619
Caption: know how old he was but he was you know

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:46.250
Caption: old like me

00:18:42.619 --> 00:18:47.989
Caption: and he was from the UK white white male

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.178
Caption: from the UK at that age group and we&#39;d

00:18:47.989 --> 00:18:51.859
Caption: given to we&#39;d put too technical

00:18:50.178 --> 00:18:53.569
Caption: interviewers that were both white males

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:56.569
Caption: from the UK of the same age group

00:18:53.569 --> 00:18:59.000
Caption: together to make that assessment so

00:18:56.569 --> 00:19:00.709
Caption: that&#39;s not helping anybody right so make

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.599
Caption: sure that there&#39;s diversity in who&#39;s

00:19:00.709 --> 00:19:07.548
Caption: part of your interviews demonstrably so

00:19:05.599 --> 00:19:09.530
Caption: whatever skills the person needs to have

00:19:07.548 --> 00:19:11.058
Caption: you want to see them in your interview

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.940
Caption: you need to see them doing it if it&#39;s

00:19:11.058 --> 00:19:15.709
Caption: coding they need to code if it&#39;s you

00:19:13.939 --> 00:19:17.629
Caption: know if it&#39;s pre-sales and they give

00:19:15.709 --> 00:19:18.949
Caption: them a scenario and get them to talk

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.298
Caption: through and pretend that you&#39;re the

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:23.029
Caption: customer get them to talk through that

00:19:20.298 --> 00:19:24.798
Caption: scenario if it&#39;s if it&#39;s UX get them to

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.660
Caption: run a workshop for you or facilitate

00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:30.519
Caption: something so you really want to make

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.520
Caption: sure that you get to see their skills

00:19:32.079 --> 00:19:38.149
Caption: the last one is making sure that it&#39;s

00:19:34.369 --> 00:19:40.069
Caption: safe you know I&#39;m sure everyone&#39;s

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.619
Caption: probably had a bad experience with

00:19:40.069 --> 00:19:44.418
Caption: interviewing so it&#39;s not about softening

00:19:42.619 --> 00:19:46.428
Caption: our interview process but it&#39;s about

00:19:44.418 --> 00:19:47.869
Caption: being kind think about the worst

00:19:46.428 --> 00:19:49.719
Caption: interviews that you&#39;ve had in the best

00:19:47.869 --> 00:19:52.130
Caption: interviews that you&#39;ve had and then

00:19:49.719 --> 00:19:54.469
Caption: let&#39;s do it a different way a better way

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.969
Caption: when someone&#39;s coming and working for

00:19:54.469 --> 00:19:58.308
Caption: you they&#39;re not going to be freaking out

00:19:55.969 --> 00:19:59.750
Caption: and nervous and stressed most of the

00:19:58.308 --> 00:20:02.149
Caption: time so you want to give them the chance

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:04.369
Caption: to perform at their best which means

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:06.050
Caption: making them comfortable think about the

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:08.089
Caption: environment give them some War

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:10.190
Caption: to make sure that you&#39;re not sitting

00:20:08.089 --> 00:20:13.339
Caption: three people across a giant boardroom

00:20:10.189 --> 00:20:17.319
Caption: table and really intimidating them so

00:20:13.339 --> 00:20:20.150
Caption: that safety factor is really helpful so

00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:22.159
Caption: you&#39;ve checked their skills and now it&#39;s

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:24.530
Caption: about making sure that the values and

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:28.099
Caption: the beliefs and the attitude is in line

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:30.770
Caption: and it&#39;s gonna add to your culture we

00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:33.349
Caption: all know that a bad apple spoils the

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:35.510
Caption: whole bunch so prevention is much better

00:20:33.349 --> 00:20:36.799
Caption: than cure so you really want to dig deep

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.440
Caption: in your interviews to make sure you&#39;re

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.900
Caption: getting the right people so behavioral

00:20:39.439 --> 00:20:43.369
Caption: based questions can be created based on

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.750
Caption: your values so this is one of the

00:20:43.369 --> 00:20:47.510
Caption: reasons they&#39;re having those underlying

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:50.390
Caption: values is so important if your values

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:51.469
Caption: are about learning then ask them to tell

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:53.780
Caption: you about a time where they&#39;ve learned

00:20:51.469 --> 00:20:56.750
Caption: something new if your values are about

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:58.369
Caption: teamwork or you know working well in a

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.540
Caption: team then ask them about a time where

00:20:58.369 --> 00:21:02.300
Caption: they&#39;ve helped their teammates with

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:05.690
Caption: something one of my favorite questions

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:07.369
Caption: is to ask if it wasn&#39;t for money what

00:21:05.689 --> 00:21:08.809
Caption: would you spend your time doing because

00:21:07.369 --> 00:21:12.109
Caption: it gives you a really good insight into

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:13.700
Caption: what someone&#39;s passionate about another

00:21:12.109 --> 00:21:14.839
Caption: one that I really like is to tell me

00:21:13.699 --> 00:21:16.699
Caption: about a time where you&#39;ve improved

00:21:14.839 --> 00:21:19.459
Caption: something or where you&#39;ve brought some

00:21:16.699 --> 00:21:21.109
Caption: innovation into your team but like I say

00:21:19.459 --> 00:21:25.189
Caption: you really need to tailor these to your

00:21:21.109 --> 00:21:26.569
Caption: specific organizational values one of

00:21:25.189 --> 00:21:29.029
Caption: the things that I would say as a bit of

00:21:26.569 --> 00:21:30.709
Caption: a red flag is if somebody can&#39;t tell you

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:33.349
Caption: about a time where they&#39;ve failed or

00:21:30.709 --> 00:21:36.229
Caption: made a mistake so I always ask to tell

00:21:33.349 --> 00:21:38.569
Caption: me about a time where you failed and it

00:21:36.229 --> 00:21:40.640
Caption: does depend on your culture but I did

00:21:38.569 --> 00:21:43.549
Caption: say no to someone recently who said to

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.810
Caption: me I don&#39;t do anything unless I&#39;m a

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.840
Caption: hundred percent sure that I&#39;m gonna

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:49.280
Caption: succeed at it and for the culture of the

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:51.919
Caption: organization that I was working in at

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.540
Caption: the time it just wasn&#39;t that wasn&#39;t a

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.390
Caption: good fit because our culture was all

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:59.030
Caption: about trying failing making it safe to

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:00.709
Caption: fail innovating so that was just not the

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:02.989
Caption: right fear and I gave that transparent

00:22:00.709 --> 00:22:05.029
Caption: feedback to that candidate after the

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:07.189
Caption: interviews had finished and he was told

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.900
Caption: he was unsuccessful I rang him and had a

Caption: him to go and try and make some mistakes

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:17.240

00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:19.069
Caption: and transparency that people really

00:22:17.239 --> 00:22:21.099

Caption: to build a great team we need to nourish

00:23:52.579 --> 00:23:57.019
Caption: it and the three areas that are really

00:23:54.890 --> 00:24:03.459
Caption: important I empowerment development and

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:06.170
Caption: leadership so in my experience

00:24:03.459 --> 00:24:09.739
Caption: empowering a team is absolutely the

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:12.680
Caption: fastest way to scale and succeed in my

00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:16.010
Caption: last role I was in Melbourne for nine

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:18.290
Caption: months and I had 80 direct reports 80

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:21.829
Caption: developers consultants direct reports

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:25.700
Caption: which is kind of insane right like 80

00:24:21.829 --> 00:24:27.919
Caption: like what do you meant to do with 80 so

00:24:25.699 --> 00:24:29.719
Caption: one of the things that I did

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.660
Caption: collaboratively with the team is put

00:24:29.719 --> 00:24:33.739
Caption: together a leadership group and with

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.660
Caption: that leadership group we

00:24:33.739 --> 00:24:37.099
Caption: with a collaborative strategy of what we

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.109
Caption: wanted to achieve over the next 12

00:24:37.099 --> 00:24:40.969
Caption: months and then each of those people

00:24:39.109 --> 00:24:42.829
Caption: within that team we&#39;re empowered to own

00:24:40.969 --> 00:24:45.049
Caption: and drive different initiatives across

00:24:42.829 --> 00:24:48.229
Caption: the state and bring in other people from

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:50.840
Caption: the teams and over like nine months we

00:24:48.229 --> 00:24:53.869
Caption: we hit our 15% growth target and we had

00:24:50.839 --> 00:24:56.928
Caption: 95 percent retention so empowering

00:24:53.869 --> 00:25:00.319
Caption: people makes your life a lot easier as a

00:24:56.928 --> 00:25:01.729
Caption: leader and it&#39;s what people want so it&#39;s

00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:02.349
Caption: the easiest way to really build a great

00:25:01.729 --> 00:25:05.239
Caption: team

00:25:02.349 --> 00:25:09.079
Caption: before I was in Melbourne I was back

00:25:05.239 --> 00:25:12.109
Caption: here in w.a and we grew our team from 25

00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:15.109
Caption: to 50 in six months and we retained a

00:25:12.109 --> 00:25:18.799
Caption: 98% average employee satisfaction score

00:25:15.109 --> 00:25:21.920
Caption: so once again empowerment empowerment

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.720
Caption: empowerment it works collaboratively set

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.030
Caption: goals with your team and with

00:25:23.719 --> 00:25:27.770
Caption: individuals so I&#39;m a big fan of letting

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:29.450
Caption: people if they understand what the

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.429
Caption: vision is and what the purpose is let

00:25:29.449 --> 00:25:32.389
Caption: people come up with their own kpi&#39;s you

00:25:31.428 --> 00:25:34.519
Caption: know let people come up with their own

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.928
Caption: goals because then they&#39;re going to pick

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.179
Caption: something that they believe in and that

00:25:35.928 --> 00:25:40.729
Caption: they want to achieve and it&#39;s a lot

00:25:38.178 --> 00:25:43.579
Caption: easier to then let them figure out how

00:25:40.729 --> 00:25:46.790
Caption: they get there it&#39;s our job as a leader

00:25:43.579 --> 00:25:48.799
Caption: to provide if there&#39;s any boundaries if

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:51.020
Caption: there&#39;s any specific you know reporting

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.390
Caption: and requirements or deadlines that they

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:55.010
Caption: need to hit and it&#39;s our job to make

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.619
Caption: sure that we provide them the support

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:59.690
Caption: that they need and make it safe to fail

00:25:56.619 --> 00:26:03.290
Caption: but other than that let them have that

00:25:59.689 --> 00:26:05.209
Caption: empowerment the other thing that we need

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:07.850
Caption: to do is make sure that within our team

00:26:05.209 --> 00:26:11.119
Caption: we&#39;ve got the right mix of skills and

00:26:07.849 --> 00:26:13.969
Caption: roles to achieve the goals and that can

00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:15.770
Caption: be tricky so one of the things that

00:26:13.969 --> 00:26:17.390
Caption: really works is making sure that you&#39;re

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:19.880
Caption: balancing the strengths areas within

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.479
Caption: your team if you let people do what

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.089
Caption: they&#39;re good at

00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:25.520
Caption: generally speaking they love what

00:26:23.089 --> 00:26:27.380
Caption: they&#39;re good at right so if you can put

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.580
Caption: a team together and every single person

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:32.469
Caption: is getting to do what they&#39;re good at

00:26:28.579 --> 00:26:35.299
Caption: and what they love it&#39;s happy days so

00:26:32.469 --> 00:26:36.678
Caption: think about what hats are needed as well

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.660
Caption: within the team you know do you need a

00:26:36.678 --> 00:26:39.859
Caption: scrum master do you need a stakeholder

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.599
Caption: someone who&#39;s gonna do stake order

00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:43.849
Caption: management you need a technical go-to

00:26:41.599 --> 00:26:45.918
Caption: person you know mentor do you need a

00:26:43.849 --> 00:26:46.859
Caption: cheerleader in your team do you need

00:26:45.918 --> 00:26:49.019
Caption: someone commercial

00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:50.400
Caption: awareness or delivery management do you

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.869
Caption: need someone who&#39;s risk management

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.549
Caption: focused so think about all those

00:26:51.869 --> 00:26:55.589
Caption: different hearts they&#39;re not necessarily

00:26:53.548 --> 00:26:57.989
Caption: role titles but their hats that need to

00:26:55.589 --> 00:27:00.178
Caption: be worn within different teams and then

00:26:57.989 --> 00:27:01.920
Caption: make sure that you consider those hats

00:27:00.178 --> 00:27:04.798
Caption: when you&#39;re putting together a team and

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:06.809
Caption: and putting together those strengths and

00:27:04.798 --> 00:27:10.169
Caption: also recruiting new people into the team

00:27:06.808 --> 00:27:12.510
Caption: think about those hats as well once

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:15.750
Caption: again Dan pink has a section around

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:17.099
Caption: autonomy in his book which is talks

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:20.428
Caption: about all of this in a lot more detail

00:27:17.099 --> 00:27:22.048
Caption: and Mark Matson has an awesome book

00:27:20.428 --> 00:27:25.500
Caption: which a lot of you have probably read

00:27:22.048 --> 00:27:27.000
Caption: the subtle art of not giving a Fu CK and

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.469
Caption: that book is awesome because it talks

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.750
Caption: about how our brains love solving

00:27:28.469 --> 00:27:32.668
Caption: problems that&#39;s what they want to do

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:35.069
Caption: they just want to solve problems so if

00:27:32.668 --> 00:27:37.199
Caption: you fix all of the problems it&#39;s just

00:27:35.069 --> 00:27:39.029
Caption: going to create more problems so you

00:27:37.199 --> 00:27:41.159
Caption: actually need to find the problems that

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:43.590
Caption: you love and find the problems that your

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.270
Caption: team loves and then like just give them

00:27:43.589 --> 00:27:50.390
Caption: all of those problems and now have fun

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:53.760
Caption: solving them sounds so simple right

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:55.589
Caption: people always want to keep either

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.290
Caption: developing themselves or developing

00:27:55.589 --> 00:27:59.969
Caption: their career so building a great team

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:03.270
Caption: it&#39;s really important that we enable

00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:05.609
Caption: this as a leader so creating an

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.380
Caption: objective career pathway is important

00:28:05.609 --> 00:28:09.689
Caption: one of the frameworks that I really like

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:12.000
Caption: is this the fear framework SFI a and

00:28:09.689 --> 00:28:13.099
Caption: that&#39;s a specific IT framework that has

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.199
Caption: different levels and different

00:28:13.099 --> 00:28:18.569
Caption: capability descriptions that people can

00:28:16.199 --> 00:28:21.449
Caption: use to progress through the organization

00:28:18.569 --> 00:28:23.880
Caption: I don&#39;t believe as a leader we should be

00:28:21.449 --> 00:28:26.459
Caption: pushing people or babying people when it

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.469
Caption: comes to career development it but it is

00:28:26.459 --> 00:28:30.750
Caption: important that we set up a framework and

00:28:28.469 --> 00:28:33.659
Caption: that we support them with what they&#39;re

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:36.178
Caption: trying to do the first capability

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:38.340
Caption: framework that I ever set up was super

00:28:36.178 --> 00:28:39.659
Caption: basic just with a spreadsheet you know I

00:28:38.339 --> 00:28:42.029
Caption: worked with a couple of the technical

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.200
Caption: people and we developed the different

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.419
Caption: role titles and the different

00:28:43.199 --> 00:28:47.939
Caption: descriptions and rolled it out within

00:28:45.418 --> 00:28:49.649
Caption: the business and it was great because it

00:28:47.939 --> 00:28:53.129
Caption: was transparent people just want to know

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:55.020
Caption: the what why the hell red if I have a

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:57.300
Caption: great one called mad skills which is

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:59.849
Caption: open source so anybody can access it and

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:02.929
Caption: once again roll titles and a really

00:28:59.849 --> 00:29:02.928
Caption: clear description

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:10.530
Caption: transparent processes is important so

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.869
Caption: when it comes to salaries salary reviews

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.430
Caption: when it comes to promotions and how you

00:29:12.869 --> 00:29:16.770
Caption: get promotions and when you get

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:18.810
Caption: promotions it&#39;s really really important

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:21.510
Caption: that you have a clear clearly defined

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:23.160
Caption: process and that people know how it

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:25.199
Caption: works and they know what they need to do

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:28.260
Caption: to achieve those things and tick those

00:29:25.199 --> 00:29:29.880
Caption: boxes and get their promotion and from a

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.170
Caption: salary perspective it&#39;s really important

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.270
Caption: that they understand how you&#39;re

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:35.340
Caption: reviewing and how its measured you know

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:37.560
Caption: what data do you review what market

00:29:35.339 --> 00:29:39.929
Caption: rates do you look at people just want to

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.670
Caption: understand a lot of time you know even

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:43.920
Caption: if you&#39;re not able to give them much

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:45.150
Caption: because of market rates and CPI and

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.460
Caption: different things as long as you can

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:49.200
Caption: explain how you&#39;ve thought about it what

00:29:47.459 --> 00:29:50.699
Caption: the process was and why this is the

00:29:49.199 --> 00:29:52.199
Caption: reason they&#39;re gonna be a lot more

00:29:50.699 --> 00:29:57.449
Caption: forgiving and a lot more patient with

00:29:52.199 --> 00:29:59.459
Caption: you learning and growing and learning

00:29:57.449 --> 00:30:02.099
Caption: growing developing in my experience is

00:29:59.459 --> 00:30:03.239
Caption: great people really want to know and be

00:30:02.099 --> 00:30:07.079
Caption: able to do this within their

00:30:03.239 --> 00:30:08.520
Caption: organization so enabling people to keep

00:30:07.079 --> 00:30:09.750
Caption: progressing with whatever type of

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.750
Caption: learning and developing and training

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:14.880
Caption: that they want is really important

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:16.800
Caption: whether it be formal PD plans whether it

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.239
Caption: be quarterly catch ups with people where

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.690
Caption: you set a couple of goals for the

00:30:18.239 --> 00:30:23.309
Caption: quarter ratify we did retros which was

00:30:21.689 --> 00:30:25.139
Caption: really great so the whole purpose of the

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:28.350
Caption: Retro was for people to gather feedback

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:30.390
Caption: and to set goals and look at how I&#39;m

00:30:28.349 --> 00:30:33.299
Caption: developing and how I&#39;m improving so

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:35.550
Caption: making sure once again that you&#39;re as a

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:41.310
Caption: leader enabling people to keep learning

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:42.810
Caption: is super important as a leader it&#39;s

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:45.390
Caption: really important that we have good self

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:47.430
Caption: reflection so we need to understand what

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.950
Caption: our own strengths and weaknesses are and

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:52.619
Caption: we need to have a growth mindset and be

00:30:49.949 --> 00:30:56.130
Caption: looking to improve and be open to taking

00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:58.290
Caption: on feedback it&#39;s super important we all

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:00.589
Caption: know the research around people don&#39;t

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:03.030
Caption: leave company as they leave managers and

00:31:00.589 --> 00:31:04.469
Caption: we&#39;ve the feedback that I&#39;ve received

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:08.250
Caption: over all of those thousands of

00:31:04.469 --> 00:31:10.229
Caption: interviews absolutely I would say 70% of

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:13.079
Caption: the feedback is that that&#39;s the reason

00:31:10.229 --> 00:31:14.939
Caption: that people are leaving so the biggest

00:31:13.079 --> 00:31:18.899
Caption: complaint that I receive is that man

00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:22.829
Caption: don&#39;t listen just repeat that managers

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:25.650
Caption: don&#39;t listen and in my experience when

00:31:22.829 --> 00:31:28.380
Caption: people come to us with a problem there&#39;s

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:31.380
Caption: two main ways that we respond the first

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:33.660
Caption: is we try and solve it for them oh just

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:36.300
Caption: do this I&#39;ll just do that what did you

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:39.479
Caption: do that for it&#39;s so easy for us to want

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:42.290
Caption: to just solve their problem the second

00:31:39.479 --> 00:31:45.179
Caption: is that we give reasons for the issue

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:47.400
Caption: which can come across as defensive oh

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.510
Caption: well yeah that&#39;s because of this oh you

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.979
Caption: don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on behind the

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:54.869
Caption: scenes this is going on so that is not a

00:31:52.979 --> 00:31:56.400
Caption: good option either people just want to

00:31:54.869 --> 00:31:58.920
Caption: be heard and acknowledged most of the

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.180
Caption: time so the next time that somebody

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.550
Caption: comes to you with a problem or a

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.869
Caption: complaint

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:09.869
Caption: honestly just try listening and

00:32:03.869 --> 00:32:12.689
Caption: acknowledging them like this and then

00:32:09.869 --> 00:32:14.729
Caption: use questions so ask them for ideas on

00:32:12.689 --> 00:32:15.899
Caption: how they think that they could fix the

00:32:14.729 --> 00:32:17.760
Caption: issue or fix the problem

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.369
Caption: ask them for what support they need or

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.900
Caption: they&#39;re looking for a lot of the time

00:32:20.369 --> 00:32:23.910
Caption: people will come up with the answer and

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:27.690
Caption: will fix it themselves they just want

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:29.640
Caption: you to listen but there is no shortage

00:32:27.689 --> 00:32:31.289
Caption: of challenging conversations and

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.140
Caption: difficult conversations but you do need

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:36.390
Caption: to have as a leader I prefer the term

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:39.209
Caption: courageous conversations channeling a

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:40.800
Caption: bit of brené Brown because it takes

00:32:39.209 --> 00:32:44.789
Caption: courage to be honest and transparent

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:47.100
Caption: with people and to practice empathy and

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:48.570
Caption: in Brenham Brown&#39;s book daring greatly

00:32:47.099 --> 00:32:50.339
Caption: she talks about the difference between

00:32:48.569 --> 00:32:52.919
Caption: empathy and sympathy and it&#39;s a really

00:32:50.339 --> 00:32:54.449
Caption: interesting description of it so I would

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.880
Caption: add that on your reading list as well if

00:32:54.449 --> 00:32:59.399
Caption: you haven&#39;t read that one yet but people

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:02.369
Caption: respect trust and value if you

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:04.469
Caption: consistently do this and I say practice

00:33:02.369 --> 00:33:09.329
Caption: empathy because it can definitely be

00:33:04.469 --> 00:33:12.089
Caption: learnt as a as a born perfectionist with

00:33:09.329 --> 00:33:13.739
Caption: unrealistic expectations I have learned

00:33:12.089 --> 00:33:16.020
Caption: this the hard way you absolutely can

00:33:13.739 --> 00:33:21.540
Caption: practice it and you do need it to be a

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:23.550
Caption: good leader the other thing that we are

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.960
Caption: often afraid of of giving feedback is

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:27.989
Caption: that it will destroy our relationship

00:33:24.959 --> 00:33:28.558
Caption: with the person but when you actually

00:33:27.989 --> 00:33:30.778
Caption: see

00:33:28.558 --> 00:33:32.638
Caption: about when was the time that somebody

00:33:30.779 --> 00:33:35.070
Caption: gave me some constructive feedback and

00:33:32.639 --> 00:33:36.869
Caption: gave me some things that I could improve

00:33:35.069 --> 00:33:38.308
Caption: on if you think about a scenario that&#39;s

00:33:36.869 --> 00:33:41.249
Caption: happened for you personally and when

00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:43.319
Caption: it&#39;s been delivered in a in a nice way

00:33:41.249 --> 00:33:45.299
Caption: generally speaking what you find is that

00:33:43.319 --> 00:33:46.619
Caption: it strengthens your relationship and it

00:33:45.298 --> 00:33:48.089
Caption: strengthens your bond with that person

00:33:46.619 --> 00:33:49.649
Caption: because you know that they&#39;re going to

00:33:48.089 --> 00:33:53.099
Caption: be honest with you and you know that you

00:33:49.649 --> 00:33:56.460
Caption: can trust them when I left ratify a few

00:33:53.099 --> 00:33:58.349
Caption: months ago I had 12 people reach out to

00:33:56.459 --> 00:33:59.939
Caption: me and sent me an email and asked me if

00:33:58.349 --> 00:34:01.259
Caption: I could give them some constructive

00:33:59.939 --> 00:34:03.719
Caption: feedback of how they can keep

00:34:01.259 --> 00:34:05.399
Caption: progressing like that&#39;s amazing that

00:34:03.719 --> 00:34:07.888
Caption: shows such a huge level of trust that

00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:13.050
Caption: they have reached out and asked for that

00:34:07.889 --> 00:34:14.310
Caption: type of feedback so there&#39;s lots of

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.800
Caption: different feedback models that you can

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:20.909
Caption: use I&#39;ve put this one together because I

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:23.579
Caption: think it&#39;s a nice balance model and yeah

00:34:20.908 --> 00:34:24.868
Caption: I like it so that&#39;s first and I&#39;ve

00:34:23.579 --> 00:34:27.960
Caption: caught it ours because it is all about

00:34:24.868 --> 00:34:30.658
Caption: us it&#39;s all about us working together so

00:34:27.959 --> 00:34:32.699
Caption: the first one is tell the person your

00:34:30.658 --> 00:34:34.138
Caption: truth what&#39;s the behavior that you&#39;ve

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:38.699
Caption: observed what is it that you&#39;re

00:34:34.138 --> 00:34:41.189
Caption: concerned about the second one is seek

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:42.658
Caption: to understand their truth because

00:34:41.189 --> 00:34:45.300
Caption: there&#39;s your truth and there&#39;s their

00:34:42.658 --> 00:34:47.219
Caption: truth and it&#39;s very rarely the same and

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:50.369
Caption: often the real truth is somewhere in the

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:52.770
Caption: middle so seeking to understand their

00:34:50.368 --> 00:34:55.078
Caption: truth can take quite a while this part

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:57.179
Caption: of the conversation can be a good half

00:34:55.079 --> 00:34:59.250
Caption: an hour of really practicing those

00:34:57.179 --> 00:35:03.899
Caption: listening skills and just understanding

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:06.419
Caption: what is what is their truth once you&#39;ve

00:35:03.899 --> 00:35:08.639
Caption: really understood that you can recommend

00:35:06.419 --> 00:35:11.848
Caption: some behavior change that you&#39;re looking

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:14.219
Caption: for now if it&#39;s if it&#39;s quite serious

00:35:11.849 --> 00:35:16.500
Caption: and it&#39;s essential then you need to set

00:35:14.219 --> 00:35:18.300
Caption: clear expectations and potentially

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.699
Caption: consequences of if the behavior doesn&#39;t

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:22.469
Caption: change what&#39;s going to happen but a lot

00:35:20.699 --> 00:35:24.750
Caption: of the time I&#39;ve found that just by

00:35:22.469 --> 00:35:26.550
Caption: recommending and a suggestion of how you

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:29.339
Caption: think that they should change things

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:30.929
Caption: generally speaking people want to keep

00:35:29.339 --> 00:35:35.310
Caption: improving and they have the willingness

00:35:30.929 --> 00:35:37.949
Caption: to change and the third is is ask them

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:39.569
Caption: what support they need so that&#39;s making

00:35:37.949 --> 00:35:41.760
Caption: sure that they&#39;ve got everything they

00:35:39.569 --> 00:35:43.650
Caption: need to be able to make the change

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.719
Caption: and also it helps confirm that they&#39;ve

00:35:43.649 --> 00:35:47.250
Caption: understood what it is that you&#39;ve asked

00:35:45.719 --> 00:35:52.199
Caption: them to do as well or the feedback that

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:56.489
Caption: you&#39;ve given going back to Bernie Brown

00:35:52.199 --> 00:36:00.989
Caption: again and Darren greatly she says clear

00:35:56.489 --> 00:36:03.179
Caption: is kind unclear is unkind and that&#39;s one

00:36:00.989 --> 00:36:05.189
Caption: of my favorite quotes because in my

00:36:03.179 --> 00:36:07.020
Caption: experience it&#39;s really true if you&#39;re

00:36:05.189 --> 00:36:09.389
Caption: clear and you&#39;re honest with someone

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.919
Caption: that isn&#39;t that is the kind thing to do

00:36:09.389 --> 00:36:12.719
Caption: because they might not be aware of

00:36:10.919 --> 00:36:14.250
Caption: what&#39;s going on and if no one&#39;s gonna

00:36:12.719 --> 00:36:15.899
Caption: tell them the truth they&#39;re gonna go

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.550
Caption: their whole career they&#39;re gonna go to

00:36:15.899 --> 00:36:18.929
Caption: their next job and their next job and

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.880
Caption: they&#39;re not going to understand what

00:36:18.929 --> 00:36:22.469
Caption: everybody is saying about them or the

00:36:20.879 --> 00:36:30.539
Caption: reason that they weren&#39;t successful

00:36:22.469 --> 00:36:32.459
Caption: so clearer is kind here is a bit of a

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:35.850
Caption: snapshot of the building blocks that we

00:36:32.459 --> 00:36:39.899
Caption: have covered today to enable building a

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:41.400
Caption: great team in my experience I did so

00:36:39.899 --> 00:36:45.839
Caption: well with time I timed it last night I

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:48.270
Caption: took ten minutes longer so that means we

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.400
Caption: have time for some Q&amp;A so it does take

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:53.040
Caption: courage to be a leader and to step into

00:36:50.399 --> 00:36:54.479
Caption: all of this as opposed to away from all

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.830
Caption: of this because it&#39;s really easy to just

00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:58.770
Caption: put your blinkers on and pretend that

00:36:55.830 --> 00:37:00.390
Caption: nothing&#39;s going on but I do promise that

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:02.550
Caption: it gets easier the more you practice

00:37:00.389 --> 00:37:04.289
Caption: these techniques and it&#39;s a real

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:06.390
Caption: privilege to be a leader to be able to

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:08.580
Caption: help people live their best lives and

00:37:06.389 --> 00:37:10.289
Caption: come to work and you know have a have an

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:13.770
Caption: amazing time and love what they do

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:16.709
Caption: it&#39;s an absolutely huge privilege so I

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:18.449
Caption: do have a bunch of stickers down here

00:37:16.709 --> 00:37:21.330
Caption: I&#39;m also would love to connect with

00:37:18.449 --> 00:37:23.339
Caption: people on Twitter or LinkedIn and I am

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:25.979
Caption: available after this for any questions

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:28.109
Caption: as well but we may as well and I&#39;m

00:37:25.979 --> 00:37:30.118
Caption: springing this money Rob sorry but I&#39;m

00:37:28.108 --> 00:37:36.169
Caption: more than happy to do some curly

00:37:30.118 --> 00:37:36.169
Caption: questions if anyone&#39;s got any yes

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:51.229
Caption: hello

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.209
Caption: just jumping back to your job ads yes so

00:37:51.229 --> 00:37:55.069
Caption: you talked about potentially eliminating

00:37:53.209 --> 00:37:57.469
Caption: the bullet points and you said you&#39;ve

00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:59.329
Caption: done that before successfully I guess

00:37:57.469 --> 00:38:03.379
Caption: the first thing that springs to mind for

00:37:59.329 --> 00:38:07.030
Caption: me then is that would create like a lot

00:38:03.379 --> 00:38:09.019
Caption: of noise that you need to process of

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:11.569
Caption: qualified people for the position you&#39;re

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:14.270
Caption: looking for and then also potentially it

00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:16.549
Caption: would be a barrier in itself in that if

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:19.609
Caption: I&#39;m a.net developer and I don&#39;t know

00:38:16.549 --> 00:38:21.829
Caption: that this is a dotnet job specifically I

00:38:19.608 --> 00:38:23.629
Caption: might be less inclined to apply for that

00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:26.079
Caption: do you find that happens at all yes so

00:38:23.629 --> 00:38:28.189
Caption: I&#39;m not saying take away the the job

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:30.530
Caption: description if that makes sense that was

00:38:28.189 --> 00:38:32.419
Caption: a.net developer role then firstly a

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:34.250
Caption: title is probably going to be don&#39;t net

00:38:32.419 --> 00:38:36.078
Caption: developer but when you&#39;re talking about

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:37.849
Caption: the what yeah might not be it might be

00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:39.950
Caption: senior consultant or developer you are

00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:41.569
Caption: correct but when you&#39;re talking about

00:38:39.949 --> 00:38:42.709
Caption: your description of what you&#39;re going to

00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:45.440
Caption: bring to the team what you&#39;re going to

00:38:42.709 --> 00:38:47.539
Caption: do the description would say that so it

00:38:45.439 --> 00:38:50.088
Caption: would say you&#39;ll be working with a

00:38:47.539 --> 00:38:52.099
Caption: fantastic team of developers bringing

00:38:50.089 --> 00:38:54.710
Caption: your dotnet skills to be able to enhance

00:38:52.099 --> 00:38:56.210
Caption: this particular application or adding

00:38:54.709 --> 00:38:58.159
Caption: value to this customer through your

00:38:56.209 --> 00:39:01.189
Caption: exceptional net skills so you can still

00:38:58.159 --> 00:39:03.318
Caption: put it&#39;s just about when you&#39;ve got this

00:39:01.189 --> 00:39:05.419
Caption: criteria this criteria this criteria

00:39:03.319 --> 00:39:08.239
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s tiring for people and it&#39;s

00:39:05.419 --> 00:39:10.639
Caption: off-putting for people the other part of

00:39:08.239 --> 00:39:14.529
Caption: your question though was mold lots and

00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:17.808
Caption: lots of applicants so I don&#39;t know about

00:39:14.529 --> 00:39:19.819
Caption: your everyone&#39;s experience here but for

00:39:17.809 --> 00:39:23.390
Caption: me I get the same amount of crappy

00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:25.579
Caption: irrelevant applications that come

00:39:23.389 --> 00:39:27.500
Caption: through regardless of how many bullet

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:28.880
Caption: points I put on my job advert sorry

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.789
Caption: you&#39;re always going to have a bunch that

00:39:28.879 --> 00:39:33.798
Caption: are completely not relevant but what

00:39:31.789 --> 00:39:36.170
Caption: you&#39;re trying to capture is that small

00:39:33.799 --> 00:39:38.180
Caption: portion that actually are exceptional

00:39:36.169 --> 00:39:40.189
Caption: that you don&#39;t want to miss out on so I

00:39:38.179 --> 00:39:41.358
Caption: would always take more over less because

00:39:40.189 --> 00:39:43.899
Caption: you&#39;re still going to get all the crappy

00:39:41.358 --> 00:39:47.118
Caption: ones unfortunately where I would say

00:39:43.899 --> 00:39:49.909
Caption: this may not this wouldn&#39;t work is if it

00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:51.529
Caption: is a non if it&#39;s a job advert for it

00:39:49.909 --> 00:39:52.729
Caption: admin assistant for example if it&#39;s a

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:54.770
Caption: job advert where you know you&#39;re going

00:39:52.729 --> 00:39:56.179
Caption: to get heaps of good applications you

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:59.419
Caption: don&#39;t need to worry about this but this

00:39:56.179 --> 00:40:02.989
Caption: is technical people you really want to

00:39:59.419 --> 00:40:07.608
Caption: get the best applications cool we have

00:40:02.989 --> 00:40:17.000
Caption: time for a couple more questions I can&#39;t

00:40:07.608 --> 00:40:20.118
Caption: see anything a question for which might

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.329
Caption: also flip over the other side to people

00:40:20.118 --> 00:40:26.298
Caption: actually applying how much weight in the

00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:30.349
Caption: modern world do you put on receiving CVS

00:40:26.299 --> 00:40:33.219
Caption: and what methods do you use to pick the

00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:33.220
Caption: wheat from the chaff

00:40:35.379 --> 00:40:40.909
Caption: finally finding the diamonds in the

00:40:37.789 --> 00:40:43.910
Caption: rough yes I&#39;m a big fan of being able to

00:40:40.909 --> 00:40:46.699
Caption: apply without Seavey&#39;s I&#39;m a big fan of

00:40:43.909 --> 00:40:48.558
Caption: being able to use LinkedIn profiles with

00:40:46.699 --> 00:40:50.510
Caption: the K via that you do need to flesh out

00:40:48.559 --> 00:40:52.940
Caption: your LinkedIn profile with a description

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:54.319
Caption: for roles not just role titles which I

00:40:52.939 --> 00:40:57.348
Caption: have seen a few were those that&#39;s not

00:40:54.319 --> 00:40:58.880
Caption: particularly helpful and I was able to

00:40:57.349 --> 00:41:01.010
Caption: apply for my last roll with my LinkedIn

00:40:58.879 --> 00:41:02.659
Caption: CV and that is becoming more and more

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.849
Caption: popular so I would say if you&#39;ve got a

00:41:02.659 --> 00:41:06.528
Caption: LinkedIn profile start thinking about

00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:11.150
Caption: using that and flesh it out just a

00:41:06.529 --> 00:41:12.979
Caption: little bit but CV is a I guess there are

00:41:11.149 --> 00:41:16.010
Caption: there a baseline right you&#39;re looking at

00:41:12.979 --> 00:41:17.239
Caption: for me I&#39;m looking at what type of roles

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:19.309
Caption: the person&#39;s done what type of

00:41:17.239 --> 00:41:21.108
Caption: experience do they have how long they&#39;ve

00:41:19.309 --> 00:41:22.819
Caption: stayed at different companies one thing

00:41:21.108 --> 00:41:25.009
Caption: I&#39;d always be careful of is calling our

00:41:22.819 --> 00:41:26.960
Caption: contract rules versus permanent rules so

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:29.659
Caption: sometimes I look at a CV and someone&#39;s

00:41:26.959 --> 00:41:31.338
Caption: kind of gone three months six months six

00:41:29.659 --> 00:41:32.959
Caption: months and I&#39;ve gone all you know they

00:41:31.339 --> 00:41:34.339
Caption: move around a bit but they were contract

00:41:32.959 --> 00:41:36.379
Caption: roles but they didn&#39;t put it on their CV

00:41:34.339 --> 00:41:38.989
Caption: so that&#39;s kind of a bit of a tip that I

00:41:36.379 --> 00:41:41.568
Caption: would say but I think either CVS or

00:41:38.989 --> 00:41:43.219
Caption: LinkedIn profiles are still you need

00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:45.049
Caption: something to get an idea to help weed

00:41:43.219 --> 00:41:47.149
Caption: through all the applications but

00:41:45.049 --> 00:41:51.799
Caption: referrals is always the best referrals

00:41:47.149 --> 00:41:54.038
Caption: referrals referrals cool so one last

00:41:51.799 --> 00:41:54.039
Caption: question

Caption: 80% of an introvert so and I&#39;m in a

00:42:19.159 --> 00:42:23.358

Caption: where they value you because that is one

00:43:24.799 --> 00:43:28.249
Caption: of the challenges that I&#39;ve seen

00:43:25.939 --> 00:43:30.108
Caption: especially in consulting where the only

00:43:28.249 --> 00:43:34.279
Caption: people that get promoted or valued are

00:43:30.108 --> 00:43:35.808
Caption: people that are loud salesy and so that

00:43:34.279 --> 00:43:37.309
Caption: can be a challenge is the culture of the

00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:40.309
Caption: company that you&#39;re working for do they

00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:44.930

00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:46.160
