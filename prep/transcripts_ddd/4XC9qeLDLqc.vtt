Caption: hello

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.319
Caption: I&#39;m not used to handheld mic so I&#39;m not

00:00:05.278 --> 00:00:10.379
Caption: sure how far to do it

00:00:07.318 --> 00:00:14.819
Caption: welcome to the 315 session

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.299
Caption: uh today we have Sarah migio she will be

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:20.399
Caption: giving her talk failure 101. what life

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:22.799
Caption: lessons can teach us about better

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:24.899
Caption: software development

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:27.118
Caption: Sarah has had a career that can only be

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.920
Caption: described as a collectic

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:31.559
Caption: but the prevailing theme has been a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.260
Caption: passion for bringing people together and

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.479
Caption: supporting teams to use the data to

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:39.419
Caption: drive the best outcomes for customers

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:41.119
Caption: stakeholders and business give a warm

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:46.139
Caption: welcome to Sarah

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:48.119
Caption: [Applause]

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:51.058
Caption: thank you

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:52.319
Caption: um now who here has ever failed at

00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:54.779
Caption: something before

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:56.578
Caption: yep failed to meet a deadline personally

00:00:54.779 --> 00:01:00.180
Caption: I failed to get out of bed with my first

00:00:56.578 --> 00:01:02.819
Caption: one this morning so I made it it&#39;s fine

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.518
Caption: and who here has been part of a software

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:08.760
Caption: project that&#39;s failed before

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:11.039
Caption: yeah maybe an incident

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.979
Caption: well I&#39;m not surprised it&#39;s pretty much

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.680
Caption: everyone in this room because failure is

00:01:13.978 --> 00:01:19.679
Caption: a big part of life and it&#39;s a massive

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.540
Caption: part of working in Tech and in building

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.259
Caption: software

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.139
Caption: code fails to execute all the time bugs

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.840
Caption: pop up seemingly from nowhere and

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:34.619
Caption: sometimes even with an IDE you fail to

00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:38.039
Caption: find that one missing semicolon

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.960
Caption: now we as individuals are usually pretty

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.579
Caption: good at finding the cause of these

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.519
Caption: little errors

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.119
Caption: but when it comes to a big project often

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:50.819
Caption: it&#39;s not until that post-modern retro or

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.220
Caption: that post-incident review that you sit

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.978
Caption: back and go

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.419
Caption: yeah that&#39;s why we failed

00:01:55.978 --> 00:01:59.459
Caption: well luckily

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:01.860
Caption: I&#39;ve been failing pretty much my whole

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:05.158
Caption: life I constantly fail

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.199
Caption: and I&#39;ve worked in probably more

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:10.199
Caption: Industries than any one person should

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:12.779
Caption: have this is just a selection and in the

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.699
Caption: past few years I have worked in incident

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:17.940
Caption: and problem management so fixing

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:21.000
Caption: problems software development causing

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.319
Caption: them and as a scrum Master trying to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.020
Caption: help others not cause them

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.520
Caption: and I am also on Twitter I often fail to

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.500
Caption: update this but you&#39;re welcome to follow

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.559
Caption: me anyway

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.899
Caption: now the benefit of me having worked in

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:39.479
Caption: so many Industries is that I&#39;ve seen

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:40.919
Caption: what failure looks like across all kinds

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:43.440
Caption: of projects

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:46.080
Caption: and I can tell you that it&#39;s the same

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.260
Caption: few things that cause a project of

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.059
Caption: whatever kind to fail

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:54.238
Caption: but one thing I can&#39;t fail to do today

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:56.518
Caption: is to mention the amazing sponsors who

00:02:54.238 --> 00:02:58.619
Caption: make this possible so if you haven&#39;t

00:02:56.518 --> 00:03:00.660
Caption: already please make sure you go get your

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:02.819
Caption: treasure map stamped when some pretty

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.699
Caption: cool stuff

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.160
Caption: so today I&#39;m going to use a couple of

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:10.738
Caption: examples from my personal life don&#39;t

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.540
Caption: worry they are embarrassing to walk you

00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:15.899
Caption: through some of the mistakes that we

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:19.098
Caption: made and how they can snowball into

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:19.098
Caption: those big failures

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:23.220
Caption: so I&#39;m going to take you back a bit in

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.500
Caption: my life to my childhood

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.080
Caption: I&#39;m about five years old

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.518
Caption: the start of term two and I&#39;m at a brand

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.580
Caption: new school

00:03:29.518 --> 00:03:35.220
Caption: I&#39;m in the pre-primary class and I&#39;m

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.900
Caption: standing at the starting line of the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.819
Caption: very first event of the day at our

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:40.979
Caption: Athletics Carnival

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.559
Caption: and then the sports teacher comes over

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.580
Caption: to us and explains what this event&#39;s all

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:47.580
Caption: about

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.680
Caption: they tell us that what you need to do is

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.860
Caption: to try and run and reach the Finish Line

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:55.378
Caption: as fast as you possibly can

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.878
Caption: now I&#39;ve been around the block a bit

00:03:55.378 --> 00:03:58.919
Caption: we&#39;re in the lead-up to the Sydney

00:03:56.878 --> 00:04:00.360
Caption: Olympic Games I&#39;ve seen a running race

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.339
Caption: on TV

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.098
Caption: I know exactly what it is that I&#39;m doing

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:07.080
Caption: here right and I look down the track and

00:04:05.098 --> 00:04:09.298
Caption: I can see the Finish Lines in each of

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.419
Caption: the lanes each with that finishing

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:15.658
Caption: ribbon set across between the two posts

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:17.339
Caption: so I think to myself yeah I&#39;ve got this

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:19.500
Caption: and you know what I&#39;m going to show

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:22.100
Caption: everyone at my new school that I am

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.100
Caption: pretty cool

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.440
Caption: so

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:30.659
Caption: at the Finish Line Ready Set Go

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.360
Caption: and we&#39;re off we&#39;re running I&#39;m running

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.580
Caption: as fast as my little legs can carry me

00:04:33.359 --> 00:04:36.959
Caption: and the finish line is very rapidly

00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:39.839
Caption: coming up

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:42.899
Caption: I get there first I&#39;m gonna win this so

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:46.019
Caption: I&#39;m running and I hit the finish line

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:48.540
Caption: and I fall flat on my face

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:50.279
Caption: you see what I thought was a set of

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.479
Caption: Finish Lines turned out to be a set of

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.859
Caption: hurdles

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.019
Caption: and

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:58.198
Caption: at five years old I hadn&#39;t encountered

00:04:55.019 --> 00:05:00.660
Caption: this before and not only did I fall down

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:03.239
Caption: I caused a terrible domino effect

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.160
Caption: children&#39;s limbs flying everywhere as

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:08.459
Caption: the person next to me fell down and

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.100
Caption: cascaded down the lanes

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:11.940
Caption: so where did I quite literally I might

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.800
Caption: add

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.440
Caption: fall down

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:18.959
Caption: well it started with assumptions

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.820
Caption: I assumed that because this looked

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:23.220
Caption: similar to something that I&#39;d seen on TV

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.860
Caption: that it must be the same

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.079
Caption: and not only that the sports teacher

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:30.779
Caption: assumed that everyone at that stance

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:33.539
Caption: like that starting line had been there

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.339
Caption: the term before and attended the class

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:38.100
Caption: where we learned exactly what hurdles

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:40.739
Caption: were and how to jump over them and not

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.020
Caption: run through them

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:45.779
Caption: the second mistake here was my own fear

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:48.000
Caption: of embarrassment I was the new kid at

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:50.039
Caption: school so even though I recognized this

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.100
Caption: didn&#39;t look exactly the same to what I&#39;d

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.139
Caption: seen on TV I was too scared to ask that

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.720
Caption: question

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.100
Caption: and thirdly there was some really poor

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.739
Caption: communication

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.839
Caption: when that Sports teacher told us to run

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:05.160
Caption: and try and reach the Finish Line as

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:07.739
Caption: fast as possible

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.479
Caption: did that really communicate what you

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:11.479
Caption: needed to do in an event like hurdles

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.619
Caption: and look it boils down to the fact that

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:19.139
Caption: we didn&#39;t clearly communicate or

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:21.600
Caption: understand the requirements and this

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.899
Caption: isn&#39;t something that affects just me

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.419
Caption: we see it every day the 125 million

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:29.639
Caption: dollar Mars probe that failed because

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:32.699
Caption: people assumed they were working in the

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.619
Caption: same units or the junior developer who

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.520
Caption: picks up a card for an API to do

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:37.739
Caption: something

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:39.660
Caption: and then they build it in Java only to

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:42.679
Caption: find out that hey it was meant to be

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.679
Caption: built in C sharp

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.559
Caption: so how do we avoid this

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:51.479
Caption: firstly validate your assumptions check

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:54.600
Caption: with your team members with your product

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:57.959
Caption: owner or program manager and if possible

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.419
Caption: with your stakeholders and end users

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:02.279
Caption: ask the stupid questions don&#39;t be like

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.199
Caption: me and let your fear of embarrassment

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:06.179
Caption: get in the way of you asking a question

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:08.339
Caption: because I can pretty much guarantee

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:10.679
Caption: someone else in the team has the same

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:13.139
Caption: thoughts as you

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:15.539
Caption: and make sure that you have a shared

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.580
Caption: understanding of what&#39;s required spend

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:20.039
Caption: that bit of extra time in your Inception

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:22.399
Caption: and then you document that for the next

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.399
Caption: person

00:07:23.098 --> 00:07:27.119
Caption: moving on a little bit a little bit

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:30.000
Caption: older a little bit wiser

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:32.220
Caption: and I&#39;m in my final year of University

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.459
Caption: I&#39;m working on my thesis which is

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.019
Caption: investigating potential causes of liver

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:39.179
Caption: disease

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:41.759
Caption: now for anybody who&#39;s done biochemistry

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:43.919
Caption: and seen diagrams like this before I

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.360
Caption: apologize for reinflicting that trauma

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:48.300
Caption: on you

00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:50.219
Caption: for everybody else I&#39;m going to try and

00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:53.220
Caption: explain what it is that I was working on

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:56.220
Caption: without throwing too many terms like de

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.940
Caption: novo lipogenesis or asterified fatty

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.940
Caption: acids at you

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:05.699
Caption: so the liver is the body&#39;s Central hub

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:08.639
Caption: for metabolism each one of the arrows on

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:10.800
Caption: this diagram represents a pathway where

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:12.559
Caption: something is metabolized from one thing

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:16.440
Caption: to another

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:18.119
Caption: for your context there&#39;s about 135 of

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.160
Caption: them I cannot fit them all on one

00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:23.160
Caption: diagram

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.860
Caption: um but my team was invested in

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.979
Caption: particularly two Pathways we&#39;re looking

00:08:25.859 --> 00:08:31.439
Caption: at how the body breaks down fats and I

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:34.320
Caption: was specifically focusing on how the

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.700
Caption: body metabolizes iron and as a whole

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.059
Caption: we&#39;re looking to see what happens

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:42.000
Caption: between these two Pathways when the

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:45.059
Caption: liver gets stressed

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.398
Caption: so for your understanding we selected

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:50.338
Caption: our Gene targets those are the items

00:08:47.398 --> 00:08:51.838
Caption: that are sort of like boxed in blue very

00:08:50.338 --> 00:08:54.659
Caption: carefully

00:08:51.838 --> 00:08:58.559
Caption: we then determined what our experimental

00:08:54.659 --> 00:09:00.059
Caption: controls would be we worked very hard to

00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:02.099
Caption: ensure that we&#39;re using the same

00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:04.619
Caption: consistent methodology

00:09:02.099 --> 00:09:07.079
Caption: and then we got to work

00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:09.359
Caption: for three months we tested each of these

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.179
Caption: targets and then we came together as a

00:09:09.359 --> 00:09:14.880
Caption: whole Lab group to share sort of our

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:17.580
Caption: version of a proof of concept and yeah

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.220
Caption: all of the genes all of these things in

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.320
Caption: blue were giving us the results that

00:09:20.219 --> 00:09:24.479
Caption: were expected the ones that we thought

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.700
Caption: would be active were and the ones that

00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:28.799
Caption: we thought would be quiet weren&#39;t really

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.559
Caption: showing us any results

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:35.398
Caption: so we carried on with our work

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:39.059
Caption: over the next 12 months I tested these

00:09:35.398 --> 00:09:41.760
Caption: targets so many times I painstakingly

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:44.580
Caption: followed our protocols even down to like

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.220
Caption: timing the seconds out

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.920
Caption: and I honestly crunch more data than I

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:52.859
Caption: think anybody knows what to do with

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:55.440
Caption: and then at the end of 12 months we came

00:09:52.859 --> 00:09:57.359
Caption: together again each person who took a

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.398
Caption: different pathway in the liver and

00:09:57.359 --> 00:10:03.659
Caption: shared our results

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:07.500
Caption: the only problem was they didn&#39;t line up

00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:10.018
Caption: now as anybody who&#39;s been part of a

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.059
Caption: software project maybe you&#39;ve dedicated

00:10:10.018 --> 00:10:14.219
Caption: a lot of time of your life to that and

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:15.659
Caption: had it fall over or fail at the last

00:10:14.219 --> 00:10:18.059
Caption: minute

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:22.259
Caption: realizing that your work

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:24.719
Caption: for 12 months of your life was wasted

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.119
Caption: that&#39;s a kick in the the guard that&#39;s a

00:10:24.719 --> 00:10:29.639
Caption: slap in the face and that&#39;s exactly how

00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:31.739
Caption: I was feeling when I found out that 12

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.220
Caption: months of my life were effectively

00:10:31.739 --> 00:10:34.219
Caption: wasted

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:39.778
Caption: effectively

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:42.179
Caption: we failed to test everything that we

00:10:39.778 --> 00:10:44.700
Caption: should have so what didn&#39;t metabolize

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:47.820
Caption: here in my piece of work

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.859
Caption: well by only testing those Gene Targets

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.679
Caption: in blue and not everything that was

00:10:49.859 --> 00:10:55.140
Caption: happening between them we relied on the

00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:58.078
Caption: equivalent of unit tests for our entire

00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:00.420
Caption: measure of quality

00:10:58.078 --> 00:11:02.760
Caption: and we didn&#39;t test the entire process

00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:05.639
Caption: end to end what happens between every

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.919
Caption: single one of those 135 Pathways in the

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.958
Caption: liver so we didn&#39;t even have anything to

00:11:07.919 --> 00:11:11.940
Caption: compare the results that we did generate

00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:15.359
Caption: to

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:19.140
Caption: and we only tested and planned for the

00:11:15.359 --> 00:11:21.778
Caption: happy path so what happens according to

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.398
Caption: plan you know how the Libra is meant to

00:11:21.778 --> 00:11:25.979
Caption: metabolize things

00:11:23.398 --> 00:11:28.260
Caption: and given that in this scenario we were

00:11:25.979 --> 00:11:31.199
Caption: deliberately trying to stress it to

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.760
Caption: break down the metabolic processes we

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.600
Caption: really should have considered that

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.600
Caption: unhappy path

00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:40.559
Caption: we just simply didn&#39;t test everything

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.540
Caption: that we needed to

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:45.018
Caption: and look that isn&#39;t something that&#39;s

00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:47.699
Caption: just restricted to medical research

00:11:45.018 --> 00:11:49.859
Caption: inadequate testing also contributed to

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:53.760
Caption: the failure of TSB bank&#39;s software

00:11:49.859 --> 00:11:57.059
Caption: migration in 2018 and that cost them 330

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.578
Caption: million pounds and lost them 80 000

00:11:57.059 --> 00:12:02.820
Caption: customers so that&#39;s a pretty big mistake

00:11:59.578 --> 00:12:04.979
Caption: for not testing something

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.278
Caption: so how do you get over this how do you

00:12:04.979 --> 00:12:10.979
Caption: overcome a lack of testing

00:12:08.278 --> 00:12:13.619
Caption: if at all possible consult the subject

00:12:10.979 --> 00:12:15.539
Caption: matter experts before you start your

00:12:13.619 --> 00:12:17.039
Caption: development work they can help you

00:12:15.539 --> 00:12:19.259
Caption: ensure that you&#39;re testing everything

00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:22.739
Caption: that you need to and that your

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:26.160
Caption: development practices are robust

00:12:22.739 --> 00:12:29.820
Caption: please don&#39;t just rely on unit tests as

00:12:26.159 --> 00:12:32.219
Caption: foundational as important as they are if

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.838
Caption: they&#39;re your only measure of quality you

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:35.639
Caption: could be potentially missing something

00:12:33.838 --> 00:12:37.799
Caption: that will cause you an error or a bug

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.859
Caption: later

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:42.719
Caption: and consider the happy and the unhappy

00:12:40.859 --> 00:12:45.359
Caption: Parts in your testing because we all

00:12:42.719 --> 00:12:47.759
Caption: know users I am a user and I know that I

00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:49.799
Caption: mistake make mistakes all of the time

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.100
Caption: and I will find some way to break

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:52.099
Caption: something

00:12:53.219 --> 00:12:59.518
Caption: now we come to the failure that frankly

00:12:56.578 --> 00:13:01.739
Caption: I&#39;m the most embarrassed about and the

00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:03.958
Caption: most modified so guys strap yourselves

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:06.838
Caption: in if you thought that was heavy

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:09.479
Caption: you see I was asked to bake a cake

00:13:06.838 --> 00:13:12.299
Caption: it was for a friend&#39;s 21st birthday

00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:14.760
Caption: party and they&#39;re a massive fan of the

00:13:12.299 --> 00:13:16.979
Caption: movie Madagascar

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.100
Caption: um so we thought hey it&#39;s their 21st why

00:13:16.979 --> 00:13:23.398
Caption: not Embrace this and Go full kids party

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:25.619
Caption: I&#39;m talking balloons birthday Partners

00:13:23.398 --> 00:13:26.578

Caption: ceiling

00:13:26.578 --> 00:13:31.138
Caption: and then we thought hey why don&#39;t we do

00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:33.119
Caption: the birthday cake in the shape of their

00:13:31.138 --> 00:13:34.259
Caption: favorite character from the movie King

00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:36.419
Caption: Julien

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:39.479
Caption: for those of you who haven&#39;t seen the

00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:42.479
Caption: movie or have forgotten is this kooky

00:13:39.479 --> 00:13:45.599
Caption: looking Lima with the crown

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:48.239
Caption: so why was I asked to bake the cake

00:13:45.599 --> 00:13:50.940
Caption: well I have a confession for you guys

00:13:48.239 --> 00:13:54.359
Caption: I&#39;m a stress Baker so when I get

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.679
Caption: stressed I bake I baked recently in

00:13:54.359 --> 00:13:57.359
Caption: preparing for this talk that&#39;s how

00:13:55.679 --> 00:14:00.000
Caption: stressed I was

00:13:57.359 --> 00:14:01.919
Caption: and it&#39;s a hobby that I&#39;ve kept up for

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.159
Caption: the past several years

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:07.440
Caption: I have baked everything from fully

00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:11.458
Caption: edible terrariums so I&#39;m talking candy

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:14.278
Caption: glass cake for the soil plastic sorry uh

00:14:11.458 --> 00:14:16.320
Caption: not plastic um matte modeling chocolate

00:14:14.278 --> 00:14:20.039
Caption: I forget the fancy French name for it

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:22.859
Caption: but really fancy things I&#39;ve even made

00:14:20.039 --> 00:14:26.759
Caption: cartoon character cakes before like

00:14:22.859 --> 00:14:28.500
Caption: Finding Dory or Dory from Finding Nemo

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.799
Caption: if you didn&#39;t see the sequel

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.578
Caption: so making something like this amazing

00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:34.979
Caption: thing

00:14:32.578 --> 00:14:36.958
Caption: shouldn&#39;t be too far out of my

00:14:34.979 --> 00:14:39.299
Caption: wheelhouse right shouldn&#39;t be too far

00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.979
Caption: from my level of expertise

00:14:39.299 --> 00:14:42.599
Caption: so I did what anybody would do in this

00:14:40.979 --> 00:14:44.458
Caption: situation and I went hunting on the

00:14:42.599 --> 00:14:46.679
Caption: internet for inspiration this is just

00:14:44.458 --> 00:14:49.138
Caption: one of the items that I sort of like

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:50.880
Caption: based my cake on

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:53.759
Caption: I worked out everything that I would

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.260
Caption: need and then I pre-ordered all of my

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.179
Caption: ingredients all the things I&#39;d need for

00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:00.239
Caption: decoration

00:14:57.179 --> 00:15:03.000
Caption: fast forward a couple of weeks the day

00:15:00.239 --> 00:15:05.458
Caption: before the party and I finished work at

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.559
Caption: lunch time so I finished early and then

00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:09.059
Caption: I go down to collect everything that I&#39;d

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:11.278
Caption: pre-ordered

00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:14.099
Caption: only problem was they didn&#39;t have half

00:15:11.278 --> 00:15:16.260
Caption: the stuff I ordered including the cake

00:15:14.099 --> 00:15:19.619
Caption: that I special ordered

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:21.720
Caption: so with very few options you know I&#39;m a

00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:24.380
Caption: day away from this party

00:15:21.719 --> 00:15:27.479
Caption: I had to come up with another solution

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:29.518
Caption: so I came up with a list of things that

00:15:27.479 --> 00:15:31.679
Caption: I thought I could substitute in terms of

00:15:29.518 --> 00:15:34.320
Caption: ingredients I grabbed everything that I

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:36.778
Caption: would need to bake cakes myself and I

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:40.199
Caption: headed home and got baking

00:15:36.778 --> 00:15:42.838
Caption: I just pulled the cakes out of the oven

00:15:40.198 --> 00:15:45.539
Caption: when I got a phone call from the other

00:15:42.838 --> 00:15:48.359
Caption: person organizing the party asking me to

00:15:45.539 --> 00:15:51.299
Caption: do them just a little favor and could I

00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:52.440
Caption: run down and pick up the guy&#39;s birthday

00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:54.719
Caption: present

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.698
Caption: now cakes have to cool after coming out

00:15:54.719 --> 00:15:58.859
Caption: of the oven and I definitely can&#39;t start

00:15:56.698 --> 00:16:00.119
Caption: carving them up or decorating them until

00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:01.619
Caption: that&#39;s done

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:05.760
Caption: and I don&#39;t know if you guys know this

00:16:01.619 --> 00:16:08.880
Caption: but birthday presents kind of a big deal

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:11.458
Caption: so sure

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.919
Caption: but as anybody who works in Perth CBD

00:16:11.458 --> 00:16:15.059
Caption: knows that on a Friday afternoon pick

00:16:13.919 --> 00:16:16.799
Caption: our traffic

00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:20.278
Caption: is insane

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:22.859
Caption: so my quick errand quickly turned into a

00:16:20.278 --> 00:16:24.958
Caption: three hour long trip

00:16:22.859 --> 00:16:27.778
Caption: and that meant that I just didn&#39;t have

00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:30.539
Caption: the time that I needed that evening to

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:32.940
Caption: start assembling this cake

00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:35.518
Caption: no problem I wake up even earlier the

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:37.500
Caption: next morning I get slicing my cake down

00:16:35.518 --> 00:16:39.539
Caption: into all the shapes that I need I start

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.278
Caption: getting ready to assemble it

00:16:39.539 --> 00:16:43.198
Caption: only to sort of get tapped on the

00:16:41.278 --> 00:16:46.258
Caption: shoulder and told you know that we&#39;re

00:16:43.198 --> 00:16:48.239
Caption: hosting this party right so we need to

00:16:46.258 --> 00:16:51.119
Caption: start setting up at about mid-afternoon

00:16:48.239 --> 00:16:55.440
Caption: and you need to go get ready

00:16:51.119 --> 00:16:58.078
Caption: so I&#39;m looking at my half assembled cake

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.000
Caption: and I know that it&#39;s going to take me at

00:16:58.078 --> 00:17:02.398
Caption: least another eight hours to finish

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.918
Caption: assembling this especially given I&#39;m

00:17:02.398 --> 00:17:07.380
Caption: working with things that I am not

00:17:04.918 --> 00:17:08.880
Caption: familiar with

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:12.359
Caption: so

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.000
Caption: something had to give

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:17.458
Caption: I decided I had to start from scratch I

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.318
Caption: re-baked some cakes

00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:21.318
Caption: and here&#39;s what I was able to deliver

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:25.619
Caption: in a little bit over four hours I

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.339
Caption: completely re-baked cakes and I

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:32.280
Caption: decorated now look it kind of it&#39;s the

00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:35.279
Caption: minimum viable product right it&#39;s a cake

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:38.520
Caption: it kind of resembles King Julian on it

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:40.559
Caption: and look when I cut I cut it open you

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:42.119
Caption: know the stuff did spill out like a

00:17:40.558 --> 00:17:44.459
Caption: pinata cake

00:17:42.119 --> 00:17:46.260
Caption: but it wasn&#39;t even close to what I

00:17:44.459 --> 00:17:48.599
Caption: wanted to deliver it wasn&#39;t sort of what

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.820
Caption: we promised and it definitely wasn&#39;t

00:17:48.599 --> 00:17:52.619
Caption: like this image which is what I was

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:54.538
Caption: aiming for

00:17:52.619 --> 00:17:56.280
Caption: so I was still understandably

00:17:54.538 --> 00:17:58.439
Caption: embarrassed and yeah here I am sharing

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:02.160
Caption: it all with you guys

00:17:58.439 --> 00:18:04.918
Caption: so how did I somebody who&#39;s got years of

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.320
Caption: experience with baking become a nailed

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:08.819
Caption: it contender

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:11.339
Caption: well

00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:13.380
Caption: the resources and tools that I planned

00:18:11.339 --> 00:18:15.959
Caption: on having ingredients I was familiar

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:19.380
Caption: with pre-made cakes so I could focus on

00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:21.779
Caption: decorating had to be substituted

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.539
Caption: the organizer didn&#39;t consider

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:26.760
Caption: conflicting priorities I mean yeah a

00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:29.579
Caption: birthday present&#39;s important but so&#39;s

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.199
Caption: the birthday cake and realistically I

00:18:29.579 --> 00:18:33.298
Caption: should have pushed back on me being the

00:18:31.199 --> 00:18:35.519
Caption: person to pick it up surely someone else

00:18:33.298 --> 00:18:39.058
Caption: could have

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:42.000
Caption: and I also failed to plan for changes in

00:18:39.058 --> 00:18:43.439
Caption: my own capacity or for these unexpected

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.640
Caption: things to happen I could have allowed

00:18:43.439 --> 00:18:46.639
Caption: myself even more time

00:18:46.739 --> 00:18:51.780
Caption: at the end it just came down to pool

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:56.760
Caption: planning now this is a contributor to 71

00:18:51.780 --> 00:19:00.000
Caption: of projects that fail so it&#39;s a big one

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:02.419
Caption: and look it&#39;s not just related to bank

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.298
Caption: to baking or anything else like that

00:19:02.418 --> 00:19:09.899
Caption: poor planning caused a three-time cost

00:19:06.298 --> 00:19:13.380
Caption: overrun for the U.S national gas

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:16.500
Caption: company&#39;s Erp update so they originally

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:19.619
Caption: budgeted 330 million dollars and it cost

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.298
Caption: them just over a billion to finish that

00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:23.160
Caption: project

00:19:21.298 --> 00:19:25.260
Caption: that&#39;s a lot of money could have been

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.900
Caption: spent elsewhere

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.339
Caption: so how do we avoid becoming nailed at

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.039
Caption: contenders

00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:35.520
Caption: if at all possible get your stakeholders

00:19:32.038 --> 00:19:37.678
Caption: your party planners involved early and

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.780
Caption: make sure that you are on the same page

00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:42.959
Caption: when it comes to what needs to be

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:47.099
Caption: delivered when

00:19:42.959 --> 00:19:49.319
Caption: a plan ahead for rework for unexpected

00:19:47.099 --> 00:19:51.119
Caption: tools and changes in your team and your

00:19:49.319 --> 00:19:54.178
Caption: own capacity

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:56.939
Caption: deliver your minimum viable product and

00:19:54.178 --> 00:19:59.359
Caption: then continue to improve on it if at all

00:19:56.939 --> 00:19:59.359
Caption: possible

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.799
Caption: so how do we learn from my mistakes I

00:20:02.459 --> 00:20:06.839
Caption: mean failure is inevitable sometimes

00:20:04.798 --> 00:20:09.359
Caption: it&#39;s a big part of life it&#39;s part of

00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:12.058
Caption: developing software

00:20:09.359 --> 00:20:13.979
Caption: but you know those small mistakes that

00:20:12.058 --> 00:20:17.279
Caption: I&#39;ve made along the way that doesn&#39;t

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:19.619
Caption: have to snowball into a massive failure

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.239
Caption: so if you can ask yourself these couple

00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:23.880
Caption: of questions the next time you&#39;re

00:20:21.239 --> 00:20:27.178
Caption: working on a software project

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:30.359
Caption: are we all on the same page and is our

00:20:27.178 --> 00:20:33.058
Caption: understanding documented

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:36.000
Caption: have we considered All Parts in our

00:20:33.058 --> 00:20:38.339
Caption: development and our testing

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.640
Caption: and have we planned for when things go

00:20:38.339 --> 00:20:43.199
Caption: wrong and is there a contingency plan in

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.900
Caption: place

00:20:43.199 --> 00:20:47.038
Caption: if you can answer yes to these three

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.419
Caption: questions

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:50.519
Caption: then you would have at least learned

00:20:48.418 --> 00:20:53.178
Caption: from my mistakes

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.179
Caption: thank you

00:20:53.849 --> 00:20:58.140
Caption: [Music]

00:20:53.959 --> 00:21:02.000
Caption: [Applause]

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.000
Caption: thank you Sarah that was so good
