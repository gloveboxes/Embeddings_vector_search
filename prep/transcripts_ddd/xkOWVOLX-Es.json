  "description": "How can you test most effectively when building serverless applications?\\nHow do I run my dependencies?\\nWhat\u0027s the current state of the art, and where are we going as an industry?\\n\\nThe most common issue teams have with serverless development is testing. The approaches that served us so well in the pre-cloud era don\u0027t seem to hold up in the new reality. \\n\\nIt feels like you\u0027re spending more time configuring local environments than writing code, tests are flaky and every day is filled with the same feeling of frustration.\\n\\nBased on my own experiences building serverless applications for startups in enterprises here in Australia and abroad, and taking testing back to first principles, we\u0027ll explore both the patterns and anti-patterns of serverless testing.\\n\\nI\u0027ll answer such questions as:\\n- Why localstack sounds great in theory, but fails in reality\\n- Whether the vaunted testing pyramid is still valid\\n- How to configure your cloud environments to unblock teams and reach development nirvana\\n\\nMostly intermediate\\n45 mins\\nCloud\\nJosh is best known for his booming voice, truly awful sense of humour and immaculately coiffed hair. Professionally he is a distinguished technologist at Contino, and the author of the Cloud Native Security Cookbook with O\u0027Reilly.\\n\\nA seasoned international speaker, he loves to share the lessons he\u0027s learnt in his career hoping that he can save people the pain and lead to happier, more impactful careers."
