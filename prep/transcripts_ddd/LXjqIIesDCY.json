  "description": "Programming languages are the expressive medium with which we create our software systems. In a sense they are thought-multipliers that enable us to give real-world expression to pure ideas. So we might also ask, are badly-designed ones potentially thought-inhibitors? We\u0027ve come a long way from punched cards and machine language, but how smug should we be about the programming languages in common use today? Are they part of the reason why software projects are still notorious for running over time and over budget and often ship with costly flaws?\\n\\nIn this talk, we\u0027ll take a journey through some of the highlights and lowlights in the development of our programming language ideas. We\u0027ll critically examine some of today\u0027s common practices. And we\u0027ll consider the promise of future developments to make it easier to translate our ideas into great, reliable software.\\n\\nMostly intermediate\\n45 mins\\nBackend Development\\nTroy is a software engineer with broad industry experience, currently developing games at VGW. He also maintains and contributes to several open-source projects, and is a mentor at CoderDojo. Troy is interested in what makes software great, not just for the user, but also for the team maintaining it."
