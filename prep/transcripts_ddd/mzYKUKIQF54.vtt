00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.500
Caption: fact they&#39;re so good at making things

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.200
Caption: back in those days they thought they

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.000

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.119

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.840
Caption: I want you to make me the most

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.819

Caption: makes me look magnificent 24 hours a day

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.680
Caption: and these guys are like

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.980
Caption: they get they get locked away in a room

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:25.139
Caption: and they&#39;re thinking uh okay that&#39;s an

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:27.238
Caption: interesting challenge we&#39;ve got here

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:29.940
Caption: so they set about doing what they know

00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:31.440
Caption: they build things they set up Machinery

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.660
Caption: they shut up equipment and they&#39;ve got

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.080
Caption: this continuous delivery fashion line

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.339
Caption: which they&#39;re sort of creating one small

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.839
Caption: problem though

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:41.160
Caption: as they&#39;re locked away in this little

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:43.319
Caption: dungeon area

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.540
Caption: we don&#39;t have any fabric to work with

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.518
Caption: what we went to do and the emperor says

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:49.799
Caption: book you guys are so talented you&#39;re so

00:02:47.518 --> 00:02:52.860
Caption: good at making things you&#39;re practically

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.900
Caption: magicians I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll work it out

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.339
Caption: um and they&#39;re a bit puzzled they&#39;re

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:57.419
Caption: stressing right because these guys are

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:58.738
Caption: going to get their heads locked off by

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:01.679
Caption: this bloke when they shot with nothing

00:02:58.738 --> 00:03:04.139
Caption: but they know he&#39;s uh he&#39;s equally Vain

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:06.598
Caption: and equally stupid so they come up with

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.399
Caption: an idea because these are the Smart Guys

00:03:06.598 --> 00:03:11.039
Caption: in the story

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:12.839
Caption: two days pass the emperor brings them in

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.639
Caption: and says right I&#39;ve given you this

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.139

Caption: hangers with absolutely nothing on it

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.598
Caption: and they tell him don&#39;t worry about it

00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:29.580
Caption: we&#39;ve built you this amazing outfit

00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:31.559

Caption: an Empire

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.419

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:52.798
Caption: right the moment the emperor goes out of

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.298
Caption: here someone&#39;s going to tell him he&#39;s

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:57.000

Caption: my coffee as well so they expect the

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.119
Caption: impossible from the Developers

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.679
Caption: developers will do what they do they&#39;ll

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:57.359
Caption: go and get the latest Frameworks and

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:58.440
Caption: toolkits they&#39;ll set it all up they&#39;ll

00:05:57.359 --> 00:06:00.119
Caption: build the pipe you&#39;ve got the nice

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.500

Caption: beautiful

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.660
Caption: one problem

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:07.979
Caption: if you don&#39;t have fabric

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.259
Caption: what are you making you&#39;re making

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.119
Caption: nothing similar to the story without the

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.919
Caption: fabric you&#39;ve got a lot of Machinery a

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:16.559
Caption: lot of time and expense put in and

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.000
Caption: you&#39;re making nothing

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:20.039
Caption: so what&#39;s the fabric when you&#39;re

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.319
Caption: building test automation what is that

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.399
Caption: what&#39;s in the word test right it&#39;s in

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:25.919

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:28.319
Caption: without a good test you&#39;ve got nothing

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.600
Caption: so if you think about fabric good thread

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:32.579
Caption: count right color right texture durable

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.679
Caption: wearable good good quality

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:35.698
Caption: characteristics it&#39;s the same as your

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:37.739
Caption: tests

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:39.600
Caption: good tests

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:41.220
Caption: are carefully crafted and targeted they

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.919
Caption: take a lot of thought to get the right

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.839
Caption: tests and they typically come from the

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.059
Caption: mind of a tester

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:50.819
Caption: need to be really well made great fabric

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:53.459
Caption: great garments great tests great test

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:56.579
Caption: automation but how do you get the fabric

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:59.579
Caption: well fabric makers make fabric

00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:00.899
Caption: and testers make tests

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:05.279
Caption: okay

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:07.619
Caption: testers are our special special breed

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:09.239
Caption: these days we are told

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:11.039
Caption: oh but we&#39;re all cross-functional we&#39;re

00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:13.019
Caption: all unicorns right so we can all we&#39;re

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.639
Caption: all full stack devs we all code like

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:16.799
Caption: demons

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:18.839
Caption: um I could run the agile rituals better

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:20.339
Caption: than that seasoned scrum master and I

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:22.619
Caption: know more about product ownership than

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:25.139
Caption: the product owner and of course we&#39;re

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:27.839
Caption: all legendary testers right

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:31.319
Caption: uh no not so much that&#39;s not reality

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:34.019
Caption: that&#39;s the textbook the reality is

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:35.699
Caption: we all specialize those those different

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:37.319
Caption: roles are fundamentally different in

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:39.179
Caption: terms of how you think in terms of your

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:41.160
Caption: career progression the study and the

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:42.720
Caption: time you&#39;ve put into them

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.940
Caption: so

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.679
Caption: I&#39;ll put it to you another way every

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.479
Caption: tester out there has dabbled a little

00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:50.279
Caption: bit in coding and there&#39;s a very small

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:51.660
Caption: number of testers who are so good at

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:53.819
Caption: coding I&#39;d say they&#39;re probably as good

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.919
Caption: as developers but I wouldn&#39;t then go out

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:58.079
Caption: and say hey testers you&#39;ve all dabbled

00:07:55.919 --> 00:08:00.240
Caption: in coding you&#39;re all now developers go

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:01.258
Caption: start writing our Enterprise systems you

00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:02.579
Caption: wouldn&#39;t do that that would be

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:04.139
Caption: ridiculous

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:06.478
Caption: so

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:08.098
Caption: the reverse is also true when the

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:09.959
Caption: emperor has asked developers and they

00:08:08.098 --> 00:08:11.759
Caption: say look you guys are amazing at coding

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:14.039
Caption: you should all be involved in testing

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:15.779
Caption: all good developers are but we don&#39;t

00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:17.160
Caption: expect you to be professional testers

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:19.079
Caption: because that&#39;s a different career path

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.819
Caption: it&#39;s different skills and it&#39;s different

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:23.418
Caption: it&#39;s a whole different background to

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:23.419
Caption: life so

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:27.479
Caption: professional testers if you&#39;ve ever

00:08:25.019 --> 00:08:29.339
Caption: worked with one they&#39;re a different read

00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:32.218
Caption: they think differently

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:33.859
Caption: they are magnets for errors a normal

00:08:32.218 --> 00:08:36.838
Caption: person

00:08:33.859 --> 00:08:39.119
Caption: choose my words I&#39;m a test ironic so

00:08:36.838 --> 00:08:41.760
Caption: I&#39;ll go with that they might think of

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:43.200
Caption: five five things that could go wrong a

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.000
Caption: tester will tell you 101 things that

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.338
Caption: will go wrong they&#39;re fixated on

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.140
Caption: breaking things not making things it&#39;s a

00:08:47.338 --> 00:08:50.760
Caption: completely different mindset in an

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.440
Caption: interview I can tell you within two or

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.239
Caption: three questions whether someone&#39;s a

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.979
Caption: developer or a tester by how they answer

00:08:54.239 --> 00:08:58.140
Caption: those questions whatever they think they

00:08:55.979 --> 00:09:00.179
Caption: might be it&#39;s quite evident brains work

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.040
Caption: differently they&#39;ve also spent years

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:04.140
Caption: training in their profession learning

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:07.559
Caption: skills techniques getting certifications

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:10.980
Caption: in testing specifically for testing to

00:09:07.559 --> 00:09:14.940
Caption: create that great Fabric or tests

00:09:10.979 --> 00:09:18.119
Caption: it&#39;s a point that Emperors often miss

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.679
Caption: now remember the guy in the story

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:21.898
Caption: well in the world of test automation

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:23.099
Caption: that&#39;s me I&#39;m not a developer but I do

00:09:21.898 --> 00:09:25.320
Caption: get the privilege of working with the

00:09:23.099 --> 00:09:26.819
Caption: development teams right across Perth and

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.619
Caption: they open their doors and we see the

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.600
Caption: automation that&#39;s being produced

00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:32.159
Caption: and while some shops are doing an

00:09:30.599 --> 00:09:33.719
Caption: incredible job they&#39;re creating great

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:35.278
Caption: Automation and it&#39;s a beautiful thing

00:09:33.719 --> 00:09:37.379
Caption: when you see it

00:09:35.278 --> 00:09:40.500
Caption: I&#39;d say the majority or many of them

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.059
Caption: have Emperors in the establishment who

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.458
Caption: are spending a lot of money and expense

00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:47.940
Caption: putting together toolkits spending a lot

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:50.039
Caption: of time building stuff that amounts to a

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.260
Caption: whole lot of nothing if I&#39;m being framed

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:54.719
Caption: because I don&#39;t have the fabric

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.179
Caption: so what are the two lessons two

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:58.799
Caption: takeaways from today how to spot a naked

00:09:57.179 --> 00:10:00.419
Caption: Emperor and how to avoid being one

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:02.219
Caption: yourself like don&#39;t be that guy that

00:10:00.419 --> 00:10:03.898
Caption: asks people to do the impossible

00:10:02.219 --> 00:10:06.000
Caption: well firstly

00:10:03.898 --> 00:10:07.500
Caption: professional testers make the great

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Caption: tests and that&#39;s where you get your

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.799
Caption: great test automation it&#39;s a key

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.778
Caption: ingredient that&#39;s often missing and

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:14.398
Caption: that&#39;s the point of the talk so if you

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:15.958
Caption: want to spot a naked Emperor it&#39;s

00:10:14.398 --> 00:10:17.640
Caption: someone that&#39;s asking developers to do

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.500
Caption: things with no fabric

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.299
Caption: the second thing is if you&#39;re working in

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.799
Caption: an environment where you&#39;re not getting

00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:25.440
Caption: that great fabric

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:28.080
Caption: don&#39;t be afraid to be that guy that just

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.000
Caption: calls it out because without that people

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.760
Caption: are going to continue murmuring in the

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.320
Caption: crowd and nodding and pretending like

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.359
Caption: yeah we&#39;re doing great with automation

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.398
Caption: we&#39;ve got 5 000 tests done and there&#39;s a

00:10:36.359 --> 00:10:40.559
Caption: whole lot of nothing what that does it

00:10:38.398 --> 00:10:43.080
Caption: leaves you exposed and that is bloody

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:44.640
Caption: embarrassing so

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.440
Caption: if you&#39;re looking to make software

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.778
Caption: better

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.398
Caption: two two tips from today I hope you

00:10:48.778 --> 00:10:52.919
Caption: remember them and I&#39;m happy to have

00:10:50.398 --> 00:10:54.719
Caption: discussions afterwards but um hopefully

00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:56.880
Caption: that&#39;s been lightweight and entertaining

00:10:54.719 --> 00:10:59.659
Caption: as I promised thank you very much

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.660
Caption: come on

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.679
Caption: thank you thank you Don thank you

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:07.940
Caption: Brendan that is the last of our talks

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:07.940
Caption: yeah what a good one to finish on
