  "description": "Can images created with code, be art? Being creative isn\u2019t the same as being artistic. Developers demonstrate creativity every day through problem-solving, application/system design, and code optimization. Even the most creative people can struggle to replicate the images in their heads on paper or canvas with pen or paint. \\n\\nSo, what can a developer do to express their inner Van Gogh, Picasso or Da Vinci? Enter creative coding; the creation of visual masterpieces with code! Imagine the graphics library as a canvas, language as paint, algorithms as the method. Let me rouse the artist within you, and inspire you to create intriguing, unique, original, and even beautiful pieces of digital art using code. \\n\\nJust like with traditional art, it can be hard to know how or where to start. Graphics programming often involves mathematics that can be daunting for anyone without a PhD in maths. \\n\\nIn this session, you will learn some ways to get started, some approaches to creating static and animated art with code, and that the maths really isn\u0027t that scary at all. You will be creating your own codified artworks in no time!\\n\\nDeeply technical\\n45 mins\\nBackend Development\\nBrandon is a software engineer and leader with an extensive background in data and systems integration.
