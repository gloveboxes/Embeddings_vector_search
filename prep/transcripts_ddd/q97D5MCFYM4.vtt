Caption: hi i&#39;m kerry muse and i&#39;m here at ddd

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.758
Caption: perth to talk to you about things i

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.600
Caption: learnt from my mentors

00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:19.920
Caption: so first up i want to call out and say

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.520
Caption: thank you to the amazing sponsors of ddd

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.880
Caption: per that have made the event today

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.199
Caption: possible

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:26.319
Caption: and next up i just want to go through

00:00:25.198 --> 00:00:27.358
Caption: why i&#39;m here to talk to you about

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.278
Caption: mentors

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:30.799
Caption: mentors are people that

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:33.119
Caption: have inspired me

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:34.799
Caption: and honestly without their influence i

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:36.879
Caption: wouldn&#39;t have gotten up here and decided

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:38.718
Caption: to try and give a talk today

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.879
Caption: they&#39;re people that help you work smart

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.040
Caption: and not hard set better goals for

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.160
Caption: yourself and actually help you achieve

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.479
Caption: those goals faster

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.599
Caption: so today why are you here and what can

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.000
Caption: you actually do with this information

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:53.439
Caption: about what my mentors told me well i

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.199
Caption: think i&#39;ve got a lot of helpful advice

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:57.119
Caption: that you can use if you&#39;re just starting

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.120
Caption: on your career in tech or going through

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.000
Caption: a career transformation like i&#39;ve just

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:01.759
Caption: done

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.520
Caption: or if you are already professional

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:05.198
Caption: working in technology it&#39;s information

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.080
Caption: that might be a bit of a reminder that

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:09.680
Caption: you can apply for yourself again

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.360
Caption: lastly what i really want you to take

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.519
Caption: from this talk is information that you

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.959
Caption: can share with other people people that

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:17.118
Caption: you come across that are starting on

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:18.720
Caption: their journey and think about the things

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.040
Caption: that are actually really helpful for a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.520
Caption: beginner

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.959
Caption: so for me where did i start well my

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:28.959
Caption: journey starts in january of last year i

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:30.879
Caption: stepped into a role or was offered a

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:33.360
Caption: role which was a temporary position

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:37.360
Caption: without much security working closer in

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.279
Caption: it i&#39;d come from working in the business

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.959
Caption: side getting user adoption providing

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:42.319
Caption: some training and i actually started to

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.759
Caption: work on that system that i&#39;ve been

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.079
Caption: working with

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.360
Caption: so suddenly that made me being the least

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.799
Caption: experienced person and i had a lot to

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.559
Caption: learn

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.439
Caption: first i needed to learn how to ask for

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:55.438
Caption: help

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.319
Caption: and work out what i wanted to do study

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.399
Caption: wise

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.279
Caption: first step was playing with a little bit

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.600
Caption: of a tafe course where i looked at doing

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:04.959
Caption: some understanding databases

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.360
Caption: and then i was fortunate enough to be

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.199
Caption: accepted into the she codes plus program

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.279
Caption: which was a six month intensive course

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.878
Caption: on coding which included some things

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:15.119
Caption: that were helpful for me in that current

00:02:12.878 --> 00:02:17.279
Caption: job and just some really useful

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:20.000
Caption: understanding and most importantly

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:23.119
Caption: access to some mentors

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.238
Caption: so where am i now so at this point 18

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:28.399
Caption: months later july 2021 i am feeling

00:02:26.238 --> 00:02:30.319
Caption: confident having technical conversations

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:31.919
Caption: i get to solve technical problems which

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.080
Caption: i love doing

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:36.720
Caption: i have learnt some programming and how

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.878
Caption: to code and i feel ready that i can

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.598
Caption: start approaching new topics

00:02:38.878 --> 00:02:43.759
Caption: the she codes plus 2020 alumni member

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:45.598
Caption: which feels amazing and i&#39;ve just

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.360
Caption: recently gotten six microsoft

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.878
Caption: certifications to back up the other

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.039
Caption: study that i&#39;ve done

00:02:48.878 --> 00:02:53.440
Caption: and most importantly i&#39;ve started an

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:56.479
Caption: amazing job and now feel so much more

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.479
Caption: secure in my career

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:01.279
Caption: for now we just want to go through and

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.479
Caption: think about what a mentor is because

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:04.238
Caption: once i started bringing this all

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.238
Caption: together i realized it means something

00:03:04.238 --> 00:03:08.238
Caption: different to a lot of people

00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:10.000
Caption: the key thing that i find is a mentor is

00:03:08.238 --> 00:03:12.158
Caption: someone who can help you with your

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.839
Caption: professional or personal development

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:16.080
Caption: someone that you trust and someone that

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:18.238
Caption: you respect but most importantly they

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.800
Caption: need to be open to having a conversation

00:03:18.238 --> 00:03:23.759
Caption: with you and talking to you

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.120
Caption: so for me what makes someone a mentor

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:29.919
Caption: for me it&#39;s not around a

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:32.000
Caption: formal arrangement where they talk to me

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.639
Caption: once a month and guide me through a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.518
Caption: process it&#39;s something that i drive with

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:39.518
Caption: people informally and access them based

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:42.238
Caption: on their area of expertise

00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:44.639
Caption: they don&#39;t need to be just a role model

00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:46.639
Caption: where they have multiple things that i

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.720
Caption: want to admire they can have some areas

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:52.639
Caption: that aren&#39;t the best but most they&#39;re

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.958
Caption: really people humans and many of them

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.878
Caption: and main thing is with all of these

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:59.518
Caption: connections that i&#39;ve made is me as the

00:03:56.878 --> 00:04:03.438
Caption: mentor mentee is overall responsible for

00:03:59.518 --> 00:04:03.438
Caption: what i do and i&#39;m setting the goals

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:06.319
Caption: so

00:04:04.798 --> 00:04:07.679
Caption: just getting you ready into these

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.438
Caption: amazing things that i&#39;m saying they&#39;ve

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:11.839
Caption: told me i just want to go through some

00:04:09.438 --> 00:04:13.839
Caption: of the basics that i needed to be told

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:15.199
Caption: as a beginner that you may not realize

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:16.559
Caption: the things that need to be taught to

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.279
Caption: people

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:20.559
Caption: so

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:22.559
Caption: the first one is time boxing which is

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:24.160
Caption: something that needed to be sort of

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:26.079
Caption: explained to me even though the name can

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.399
Caption: give it away and this is just about

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:30.720
Caption: defining a period of time

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:32.799
Caption: to the problem that you&#39;re tackling this

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.040
Caption: can be used to tackle something you&#39;re

00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:37.039
Caption: not looking forward to doing or it could

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.040
Caption: be to think about how long you want to

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.040
Caption: give a technical problem and the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.119
Caption: solution that you&#39;re trying out before

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.240
Caption: stopping and asking for help

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:47.040
Caption: so here set your time limit once that&#39;s

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:48.720
Caption: up

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.559
Caption: walk away is normally step i need to

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.679
Caption: take grab a cup of coffee

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:55.440
Caption: and come back and assess your progress

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:57.440
Caption: when you&#39;re at this stage this is when

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.479
Caption: you start to consider if you need to ask

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.959
Caption: for help and maybe also just rethink

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:06.080
Caption: your approach

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:08.638
Caption: and the next thing that was key in

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:10.959
Caption: learning and understanding is realizing

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.800
Caption: that i will never know everything no one

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:14.959
Caption: will ever know everything

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:17.039
Caption: moving into the technology space is

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:18.959
Caption: about being comfortable in not knowing

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.199
Caption: and asking questions

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:23.279
Caption: it&#39;s about continued learning and

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.720
Caption: realizing you&#39;re constantly on that

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.880
Caption: growth stage

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.559
Caption: and first thing i started to realize is

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.119
Caption: even experts need to ask for help

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:31.119
Caption: sometimes

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:35.600
Caption: on starting to learn an important

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.919
Caption: concept i needed to realize was about

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.080
Caption: foundations first there&#39;s an abundance

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.240
Caption: of things that you can learn and it&#39;s

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:45.839
Caption: easy to try and chop and change test

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:47.679
Caption: things out so using an example of code

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:50.079
Caption: and programming i want to talk to you

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:52.399
Caption: about say learning python

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:54.638
Caption: so you pick the one thing

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:57.119
Caption: and you start

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.479
Caption: the main thing is realistically to

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:00.319
Caption: define what it is that you&#39;re trying to

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.559
Caption: do with what you&#39;re trying to learn so

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:04.559
Caption: with python it could be find out how to

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:05.759
Caption: analyze some certain data or build

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:07.919
Caption: something

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.559
Caption: from here it&#39;s really around getting

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.880
Caption: that item done and sticking with it so

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:14.880
Caption: if indentation errors are driving you

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.559
Caption: absolutely crazy and you&#39;ve heard that

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.000
Caption: python and indentation are a bit of a

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:19.759
Caption: thing that you&#39;re not going to encounter

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.079
Caption: with the next language you could be

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:24.319
Caption: trying to jump ship what i&#39;m saying is

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:26.239
Caption: you need to really stick that out and

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:28.880
Caption: finish that goal because these are

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:30.160
Caption: things that you&#39;re going to be able to

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.080
Caption: transfer

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.600
Caption: you don&#39;t need to become an expert but

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:35.599
Caption: these foundation principles that you&#39;ve

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.800
Caption: learned from python will carry across

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.000
Caption: when you try and learn some more

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:40.079
Caption: programming

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.600
Caption: and the key thing is here when you look

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:43.359
Caption: back i know that you&#39;re probably going

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.119
Caption: to think those indentation errors were

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:46.478
Caption: actually useful it was an error message

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:49.839
Caption: that actually told me what the problem

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:49.839
Caption: was what was i thinking

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:54.160
Caption: from here i want to talk about writing

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:55.758
Caption: some things down so it&#39;s something

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.519
Caption: you&#39;re told probably no matter what

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:00.239
Caption: industry you&#39;re in but is really

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:02.559
Caption: important with technology documentation

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:04.638
Caption: is a big part of technical roles that

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:06.479
Caption: doesn&#39;t often get spoken about

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.399
Caption: before writing notes down for yourself i

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:10.080
Caption: encourage you to store these in

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:11.279
Caption: something you can access anywhere or

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:13.758
Caption: online

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:16.079
Caption: one note notion if you&#39;ve not heard of

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:18.639
Caption: is another online tool and even keeping

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:20.638
Caption: things in github can be really useful

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:22.240
Caption: and shareable

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:25.279
Caption: when i need to learn something that

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:27.519
Caption: requires more than three steps i work on

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:29.279
Caption: a checklist i

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:31.440
Caption: quickly realized that a few months later

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:33.039
Caption: i don&#39;t remember that much and i need to

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.319
Caption: go through and remind myself of the

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:36.880
Caption: steps

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:39.279
Caption: and importantly the other thing is try

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.959
Caption: and write things down in a way that you

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:41.839
Caption: can send other people when they ask the

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:44.239
Caption: question

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:45.440
Caption: they&#39;ll appreciate it and if they do the

00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:47.839
Caption: same i&#39;m sure they&#39;re going to return

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.519
Caption: the favor when you ask them

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:51.919
Caption: from here i couldn&#39;t be talking about

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:54.079
Caption: what mentors told me without the things

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:55.759
Caption: that they constantly reinforce which is

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:57.679
Caption: to put a meaningful comments in your

00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:00.639
Caption: code and make sure your commit messages

00:07:57.679 --> 00:08:00.639
Caption: say something helpful

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:05.759
Caption: from here i want to cover a bit about

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:07.359
Caption: how to document things down

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:08.720
Caption: and if you&#39;re in a position where you&#39;re

00:08:07.359 --> 00:08:10.799
Caption: helping somebody out i&#39;d really

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.079
Caption: encourage you to see if you can just

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:13.519
Caption: show them a little bit about how you

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:15.598
Caption: store information about what they&#39;re

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:17.519
Caption: asking about

00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:19.440
Caption: for me i

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:21.359
Caption: was getting a lot of different links and

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.119
Caption: a lot of different resources and

00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:24.399
Caption: bookmarks are actually a really

00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:25.598
Caption: impractical way to store that

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:27.759
Caption: information

00:08:25.598 --> 00:08:30.079
Caption: i&#39;ve started to use notion to store the

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:33.119
Caption: link and index it against what that sort

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:35.119
Caption: of particular topic&#39;s about and maybe do

00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:36.559
Caption: some other tags that are meaningful and

00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:38.158
Caption: i can actually go through and sort

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.760
Caption: through that when i can&#39;t remember the

00:08:38.158 --> 00:08:41.518
Caption: name of the tool i was told about a few

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.239
Caption: months later

00:08:41.518 --> 00:08:46.719
Caption: the other thing is again that advice i

00:08:44.239 --> 00:08:48.239
Caption: was given is to consider making it so

00:08:46.719 --> 00:08:50.479
Caption: you can actually publish these notes

00:08:48.239 --> 00:08:52.159
Caption: online somewhere if you&#39;ve had to google

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:54.079
Caption: something three or four different ways

00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:55.679
Caption: in order to find this information

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.519
Caption: chances are someone else is doing the

00:08:55.679 --> 00:09:00.000
Caption: same thing and you can share that

00:08:57.518 --> 00:09:01.919
Caption: information and start to connect with

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.760
Caption: other people

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:06.000
Caption: lastly this is something that was

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.160
Caption: groundbreaking idea for me but might be

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.679
Caption: obvious to other people but i still i

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:10.559
Caption: still want to call it out

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:12.479
Caption: it&#39;s

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:14.320
Caption: when i was writing notes down if i

00:09:12.479 --> 00:09:16.719
Caption: couldn&#39;t find a logical space i would

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.799
Caption: either spend hours reorganizing my notes

00:09:16.719 --> 00:09:20.879
Caption: so i could put it somewhere or not write

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:22.640
Caption: that piece of information down

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.080
Caption: someone showed me putting things into a

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.320
Caption: tidbit section

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.760
Caption: if i need to find it later all these

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.080
Caption: online tools have a search feature

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.838
Caption: anyway but at least i&#39;ve written it down

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.160
Caption: and moved on with my day and the task at

00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:34.159
Caption: hand

00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:39.679
Caption: so rubber ducking which experienced

00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:42.319
Caption: developers probably know well too well

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:44.958
Caption: it&#39;s a book it&#39;s come from the book the

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.799
Caption: pragmatic programmer the idea of rubber

00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:49.278
Caption: ducking is sitting when you&#39;re trying to

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:50.799
Caption: debug your code describing it line by

00:09:49.278 --> 00:09:52.559
Caption: line to a duck

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:55.200
Caption: as if

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:57.760
Caption: figuring out where the problem is

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.119
Caption: i have used this as well just in general

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.040
Caption: talking out loud about technical

00:09:59.119 --> 00:10:02.958
Caption: problems that i&#39;m trying to solve

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:03.759
Caption: and working through what that&#39;s going to

00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.919
Caption: be

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.078
Caption: now your rubber duck doesn&#39;t need to be

00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:11.119
Caption: a piece of plastic it can be your pet it

00:10:08.078 --> 00:10:13.278
Caption: can be a friend it can be your spouse i

00:10:11.119 --> 00:10:15.599
Caption: also find that sometimes just pretending

00:10:13.278 --> 00:10:17.838
Caption: to write out a message or an email in

00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:19.440
Caption: the process of typing out the question

00:10:17.838 --> 00:10:21.440
Caption: has helped me work out what i&#39;m trying

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.278
Caption: to figure out and come closer to the

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.518
Caption: solution

00:10:23.278 --> 00:10:27.679
Caption: the step that i always try and follow

00:10:25.518 --> 00:10:30.159
Caption: after i get past this rubber duck thing

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:32.559
Caption: is whilst i get and start to understand

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:35.278
Caption: the problems i need to take in english

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:37.039
Caption: is to write it down in pseudocode being

00:10:35.278 --> 00:10:39.278
Caption: a mismatch of whatever language i&#39;m

00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:41.278
Caption: trying to write it in and english

00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:44.078
Caption: and when i start to step through and get

00:10:41.278 --> 00:10:45.838
Caption: the syntax right i still can keep sight

00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:48.078
Caption: of the next few steps i&#39;m trying to

00:10:45.838 --> 00:10:48.078
Caption: follow

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.000
Caption: from here i thought it&#39;d be a good

00:10:50.479 --> 00:10:53.359
Caption: chance to tell you aside from rubber

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.838
Caption: ducks there&#39;s some other cool things

00:10:53.359 --> 00:10:58.159
Caption: that i learned from my mentors the first

00:10:55.838 --> 00:11:00.159
Caption: one which i use embarrassingly often and

00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:02.559
Caption: rave about is my favorite keyboard

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:05.518
Caption: shortcut i learned last year for windows

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:08.239
Caption: it&#39;s as spacebar and full stop and for

00:11:05.518 --> 00:11:10.320
Caption: mac it&#39;s control command control and

00:11:08.239 --> 00:11:12.559
Caption: space and that just brings up an emoji

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.838
Caption: keyboard you can put this in wherever

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:18.320
Caption: you want but it&#39;s useful to have on hand

00:11:15.838 --> 00:11:19.679
Caption: from there i also thought i&#39;d call out

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.440
Caption: to a

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:24.320
Caption: something that saved me a couple hours a

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.720
Caption: few times is bracket pair colorizer

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.479
Caption: which is a vs code extension to help you

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:30.799
Caption: match up where your closing brackets

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:33.760
Caption: might have gone a little bit wonky

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:35.838
Caption: and undraw which is just an image

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.040
Caption: library it comes with some standard

00:11:35.838 --> 00:11:39.518
Caption: images what i&#39;ve used in this

00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:40.880
Caption: presentation that you can actually set

00:11:39.518 --> 00:11:42.398
Caption: the color to

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.958
Caption: i find it really helpful to have things

00:11:42.398 --> 00:11:46.719
Caption: like this bookmarked and on hand because

00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:49.278
Caption: whilst i&#39;m not working full time as a

00:11:46.719 --> 00:11:50.799
Caption: web developer i&#39;ve got some resources i

00:11:49.278 --> 00:11:52.119
Caption: can refer to when i need something in a

00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:54.638
Caption: pinch

00:11:52.119 --> 00:11:58.479
Caption: flatikon.com is another useful place to

00:11:54.638 --> 00:12:00.559
Caption: get images and colors.lol is one of many

00:11:58.479 --> 00:12:02.398
Caption: color palette pickers that are out there

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:05.599
Caption: it just happens to be the url that i

00:12:02.398 --> 00:12:05.599
Caption: remember when i need something

00:12:06.398 --> 00:12:09.838
Caption: now i&#39;m going to update and have the

00:12:07.838 --> 00:12:11.760
Caption: information available of my favorite

00:12:09.838 --> 00:12:14.638
Caption: items available on github which is

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.398
Caption: hellocareerlead.github.io

00:12:14.638 --> 00:12:18.958
Caption: so you can access these links easily

00:12:16.398 --> 00:12:20.479
Caption: afterwards

00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.159
Caption: so

00:12:20.479 --> 00:12:24.479
Caption: next up i want to take you through some

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:27.199
Caption: less common advice and really

00:12:24.479 --> 00:12:29.199
Caption: some of the super meaningful things that

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.278
Caption: aren&#39;t necessarily things i hear or have

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.239
Caption: been told more than once

00:12:31.278 --> 00:12:34.799
Caption: so

00:12:32.239 --> 00:12:37.119
Caption: the first step is helping others while

00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:39.200
Caption: you&#39;re still learning so you may not

00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:41.039
Caption: feel like an expert but explaining

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.958
Caption: something that you&#39;ve just learned

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:45.039
Caption: is what i found the best way to really

00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:47.760
Caption: cement my understanding

00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:49.278
Caption: i found that beginners often spot

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.119
Caption: beginner problems

00:12:49.278 --> 00:12:52.719
Caption: going through the sheikahs program

00:12:51.119 --> 00:12:54.320
Caption: working with other women learning how to

00:12:52.719 --> 00:12:57.199
Caption: code at the same time

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.479
Caption: i had a situation where five mentors had

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.160
Caption: come up scratched their head and

00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:01.760
Caption: couldn&#39;t work out what on earth was

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:03.278
Caption: going wrong with what i was doing and

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.760
Caption: why it wasn&#39;t working

00:13:03.278 --> 00:13:07.919
Caption: i ended up going in the too hard section

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.359
Caption: of the room with a couple of other girls

00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:11.760
Caption: where a few people had looked at

00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:12.958
Caption: couldn&#39;t figure out what on earth it was

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.119
Caption: i

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.398
Caption: thought mine was lost cause tried to

00:13:15.119 --> 00:13:17.440
Caption: help the girl that was sitting over

00:13:16.398 --> 00:13:20.719
Caption: there with me

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.720
Caption: and we able to go through steps she was

00:13:20.719 --> 00:13:24.159
Caption: ahead of where i was but i actually

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:25.759
Caption: helped figure out what her problem was

00:13:24.159 --> 00:13:26.638
Caption: and gotta run away

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.320
Caption: now

00:13:26.638 --> 00:13:30.320
Caption: she insisted that she try and do the

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.600
Caption: same for me even though so many people

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.518
Caption: had just

00:13:31.599 --> 00:13:35.119
Caption: couldn&#39;t work out what was going on

00:13:33.518 --> 00:13:37.838
Caption: and she actually spotted what the issue

00:13:35.119 --> 00:13:39.679
Caption: was immediately because as a beginner

00:13:37.838 --> 00:13:41.838
Caption: it&#39;s a mistake she&#39;d made and something

00:13:39.679 --> 00:13:43.599
Caption: she&#39;d written down but it was something

00:13:41.838 --> 00:13:45.838
Caption: assumed by any developer that was

00:13:43.599 --> 00:13:48.638
Caption: looking at it

00:13:45.838 --> 00:13:50.398
Caption: the other thing is really talking to

00:13:48.638 --> 00:13:52.000
Caption: other people learning makes you realize

00:13:50.398 --> 00:13:53.599
Caption: there&#39;s so many different ways that you

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.599
Caption: can tackle a problem

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:58.239
Caption: and helps you think about other ways of

00:13:55.599 --> 00:14:00.880
Caption: thinking about technical issues

00:13:58.239 --> 00:14:02.958
Caption: and lastly if all else fails you can

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.078
Caption: always be their rubber duck and help

00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.078
Caption: them talk through the issue

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:10.879
Caption: now on learning and something i&#39;ve taken

00:14:09.198 --> 00:14:13.359
Caption: away from going through a course

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.000
Caption: learning about coding was really when i

00:14:13.359 --> 00:14:18.559
Caption: start to find out about new technical

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.880
Caption: item coding language or some other tool

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:22.398
Caption: that i&#39;m using i approach it by building

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.160
Caption: a project first

00:14:22.398 --> 00:14:27.919
Caption: so not only does this help you get a

00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:30.319
Caption: portfolio of work but it is just really

00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:33.359
Caption: a great way to learn so i start by doing

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.838
Caption: one tutorial and limiting myself to that

00:14:33.359 --> 00:14:38.320
Caption: i then go around and ask people around

00:14:35.838 --> 00:14:39.440
Caption: that i might know to work out what a

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.479
Caption: good project would be for that

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.398
Caption: technology so at the moment i&#39;m wanting

00:14:42.479 --> 00:14:46.078
Caption: to learn more about.net framework

00:14:44.398 --> 00:14:48.398
Caption: so i&#39;ve reached out to people i know

00:14:46.078 --> 00:14:50.880
Caption: that work in that space and asked what

00:14:48.398 --> 00:14:53.198
Caption: would be a good idea for a project

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.239
Caption: by talking to a mentor she said maybe

00:14:53.198 --> 00:14:57.759
Caption: not using blazer and suggested i create

00:14:56.239 --> 00:15:00.638
Caption: an app to store my friends date of

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.518
Caption: births so at the moment i&#39;m now working

00:15:00.638 --> 00:15:03.198
Caption: through

00:15:01.518 --> 00:15:04.559
Caption: getting requirements together for me to

00:15:03.198 --> 00:15:05.919
Caption: work through

00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:07.679
Caption: because i actually need a bit of a

00:15:05.919 --> 00:15:09.838
Caption: framework i get a little bit distracted

00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:12.239
Caption: and a little bit too creative otherwise

00:15:09.838 --> 00:15:14.719
Caption: and i&#39;m going to set myself a time frame

00:15:12.239 --> 00:15:16.000
Caption: on when i want to finish this buy again

00:15:14.719 --> 00:15:17.039
Caption: for myself

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.518
Caption: um

00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:21.759
Caption: and the idea isn&#39;t to be horrible i&#39;m

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:26.479
Caption: still flexible with myself i&#39;ve just got

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:28.239
Caption: a set goal and i&#39;m keeping it fun

00:15:26.479 --> 00:15:30.880
Caption: from here i want to talk a little bit

00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:33.198
Caption: more about certification certifications

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.119
Caption: are what helped me bridge what i learnt

00:15:33.198 --> 00:15:37.039
Caption: at work and what i learned through

00:15:35.119 --> 00:15:39.518
Caption: g-codes and all of my self-study

00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:41.119
Caption: together to really help shape my career

00:15:39.518 --> 00:15:43.039
Caption: so for me

00:15:41.119 --> 00:15:43.838
Caption: validating all of that information was

00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:45.758
Caption: key

00:15:43.838 --> 00:15:47.518
Caption: and i&#39;ll talk a bit more around

00:15:45.758 --> 00:15:48.799
Caption: microsoft certifications because that&#39;s

00:15:47.518 --> 00:15:50.958
Caption: what i know and i&#39;ve had recent

00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:52.479
Caption: experience with but i understand this

00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:55.198
Caption: pretty much applies straight across to

00:15:52.479 --> 00:15:57.039
Caption: your aws search and other technology

00:15:55.198 --> 00:15:57.758
Caption: that you&#39;re going to learn

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:59.599
Caption: so

00:15:57.758 --> 00:16:02.000
Caption: first thing is there&#39;s online training

00:15:59.599 --> 00:16:04.078
Caption: days particularly since 2020 more and

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.838
Caption: more online training days have become

00:16:04.078 --> 00:16:10.398
Caption: available from these certification

00:16:06.838 --> 00:16:12.799
Caption: providers and they are

00:16:10.398 --> 00:16:14.320
Caption: free a lot of the time so can you really

00:16:12.799 --> 00:16:16.719
Caption: give some tips on preparing for that

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.518
Caption: particular exam during those days

00:16:16.719 --> 00:16:22.239
Caption: and also make sure you look at the

00:16:19.518 --> 00:16:23.838
Caption: learning materials available for by

00:16:22.239 --> 00:16:25.440
Caption: who&#39;s setting the exam

00:16:23.838 --> 00:16:27.758
Caption: there&#39;s lots of pathways available

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.758
Caption: microsoft learn and lots of information

00:16:27.758 --> 00:16:32.078
Caption: in the documentation

00:16:29.758 --> 00:16:33.838
Caption: from here when you start thinking about

00:16:32.078 --> 00:16:35.919
Caption: preparing for your exam

00:16:33.838 --> 00:16:38.719
Caption: even if the end certificate that you&#39;re

00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:39.679
Caption: wanting to get is a little bit higher

00:16:38.719 --> 00:16:42.479
Caption: level

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:44.638
Caption: still start with a basic exam often they

00:16:42.479 --> 00:16:47.278
Caption: might be a little bit cheaper you easier

00:16:44.638 --> 00:16:50.000
Caption: to access but the key thing is preparing

00:16:47.278 --> 00:16:51.440
Caption: for these exams it&#39;s a bit of a strange

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.838
Caption: environment if you haven&#39;t done a

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:56.078
Caption: multiple choice test for a long time you

00:16:53.838 --> 00:16:59.278
Caption: kind of forget the strange nuances

00:16:56.078 --> 00:17:01.919
Caption: involved there so take the time to start

00:16:59.278 --> 00:17:03.440
Caption: with the basic exam and make sure you&#39;re

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:05.918
Caption: ready to go when you start to challenge

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.520
Caption: yourself a little bit more

00:17:05.918 --> 00:17:09.359
Caption: from here i just want to talk you

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.359
Caption: through a little bit about how i prepare

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:12.479
Caption: the exams and some of the advice that i

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:15.280
Caption: received

00:17:12.479 --> 00:17:17.280
Caption: so for me i needed to get the date

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.119
Caption: booked and set a time frame for when i

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.559
Caption: wanted to attend the exam

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:22.000
Caption: if you&#39;re doing this i encourage you to

00:17:20.558 --> 00:17:24.399
Caption: also have a look at what your

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.160
Caption: cancellation window is or your rebooking

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.599
Caption: window is and maybe set yourself a

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:32.080
Caption: reminder just before that expires too

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:35.038
Caption: what i then do is find where the

00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:37.918
Caption: resource is available for exam contents

00:17:35.038 --> 00:17:40.479
Caption: and work out where the exam&#39;s weighted

00:17:37.918 --> 00:17:41.918
Caption: and for me i dump that into something

00:17:40.479 --> 00:17:43.678
Caption: that i can edit

00:17:41.918 --> 00:17:45.759
Caption: and i straight away anything i think i

00:17:43.678 --> 00:17:47.119
Caption: know inside out i delete i don&#39;t need to

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.479
Caption: think about that

00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:52.239
Caption: and i flag yellow anything i&#39;ve got no

00:17:50.479 --> 00:17:54.239
Caption: idea what they&#39;re talking about

00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:55.199
Caption: and leave the rest there and review the

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:56.640
Caption: waiting

00:17:55.199 --> 00:17:58.719
Caption: and then that&#39;s where i focus on my

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.359
Caption: learning on

00:17:58.719 --> 00:18:03.359
Caption: from here i generally honestly sometimes

00:18:01.359 --> 00:18:05.760
Caption: forget about my exam for a little while

00:18:03.359 --> 00:18:08.319
Caption: and repeat that exercise couple hours

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.320
Caption: before the exam making sure i research

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:12.719
Caption: any of those problem areas immediately

00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:15.038
Caption: before the exam hits and hoping i retain

00:18:12.719 --> 00:18:17.520
Caption: that information

00:18:15.038 --> 00:18:19.119
Caption: the next thing is online proctoring

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.080
Caption: which is a

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:24.479
Caption: really useful thing that&#39;s available but

00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:25.918
Caption: something just to be aware of the exam

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:27.119
Caption: conditions are a little bit strange

00:18:25.918 --> 00:18:28.798
Caption: having someone watching you through a

00:18:27.119 --> 00:18:30.719
Caption: webcam

00:18:28.798 --> 00:18:33.279
Caption: and there&#39;s a bit of advice they warn

00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:35.280
Caption: you about but a few things that can

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.200
Caption: easily catch you out is they generally

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.880
Caption: only allow one screen

00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:40.399
Caption: and that means you can&#39;t plug your

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.558
Caption: laptop into a monitor and have your

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.400
Caption: laptop on your desk

00:18:42.558 --> 00:18:45.839
Caption: they often have a rule only allowing you

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.679
Caption: to have water

00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:48.880
Caption: even if it doesn&#39;t say that specifically

00:18:47.678 --> 00:18:50.319
Caption: you can get called out for having a

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.160
Caption: coffee on your desk

00:18:50.319 --> 00:18:54.079
Caption: and look

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.599
Caption: it&#39;s just

00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:57.599
Caption: it&#39;s a bit intense having someone

00:18:55.599 --> 00:19:00.160
Caption: watching you like that and to be aware

00:18:57.599 --> 00:19:01.678
Caption: for aware of it i&#39;ve gotten called out

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.200
Caption: because my cat&#39;s walked across the room

00:19:01.678 --> 00:19:04.558
Caption: and my eyes have come off the screen for

00:19:03.199 --> 00:19:06.719
Caption: a few seconds

00:19:04.558 --> 00:19:09.119
Caption: it&#39;s what it is it&#39;s convenient doing it

00:19:06.719 --> 00:19:11.760
Caption: at home but just be aware it&#39;s a pretty

00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:14.319
Caption: unusual setting and you start to get

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.119
Caption: used to it with a few more exams

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:19.359
Caption: lastly once you&#39;ve nailed that exam and

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:21.199
Caption: passed it make sure that you stop and

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:23.038
Caption: celebrate on linkedin and share that

00:19:21.199 --> 00:19:24.719
Caption: information you can link up those

00:19:23.038 --> 00:19:25.839
Caption: certifications

00:19:24.719 --> 00:19:27.839
Caption: straight through to your linkedin

00:19:25.839 --> 00:19:30.079
Caption: profile so the verified

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:32.719
Caption: cert shows up straight away and get that

00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:32.719
Caption: recognition

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:36.079
Caption: so

00:19:33.918 --> 00:19:37.199
Caption: on career advice at this point i&#39;ve

00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:38.880
Caption: talked about

00:19:37.199 --> 00:19:40.880
Caption: what i&#39;ve been learning at work what

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.880
Caption: i&#39;ve certified and finishing off she

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.280
Caption: codes i need to start planning what my

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.160
Caption: next steps were going to be

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.880
Caption: so

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.720
Caption: for me i had the pleasure of having an

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.798
Caption: amazing boss and a great working

00:19:50.719 --> 00:19:55.119
Caption: environment but just a little bit growth

00:19:52.798 --> 00:19:57.839
Caption: restricted in that role so i had time on

00:19:55.119 --> 00:20:00.079
Caption: my side to start thinking about things i

00:19:57.839 --> 00:20:02.880
Caption: started talking to people who maybe have

00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:04.959
Caption: hired but weren&#39;t hiring at that time to

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.199
Caption: get a bit of information informally

00:20:04.959 --> 00:20:10.399
Caption: around interview processes different

00:20:07.199 --> 00:20:12.558
Caption: roles that i might be suitable for and

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.400
Caption: information that maybe i&#39;d done and

00:20:12.558 --> 00:20:16.479
Caption: teasing out what was super impressive

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.799
Caption: that i&#39;d done and knowing what to

00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:21.119
Caption: actually put onto my cv

00:20:18.798 --> 00:20:22.959
Caption: from here i also kept an eye on

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:24.640
Caption: different roles and constantly having a

00:20:22.959 --> 00:20:27.199
Caption: look at what skills would be

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.880
Caption: transferable that i needed to include in

00:20:27.199 --> 00:20:30.239
Caption: my job applications and make sure i&#39;d

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.918
Caption: highlighted from previous work

00:20:30.239 --> 00:20:33.038
Caption: experience

00:20:31.918 --> 00:20:35.279
Caption: i

00:20:33.038 --> 00:20:38.158
Caption: strongly suggest that when you start

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.239
Caption: working in it and need to interview to

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:42.559
Caption: ask a few questions about the interview

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:44.000
Caption: format and just being prepared if you&#39;re

00:20:42.558 --> 00:20:46.158
Caption: going to be going in for a technical

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.520
Caption: interview and

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:49.120
Caption: understand what sort of questions might

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.359
Caption: pop up

00:20:49.119 --> 00:20:53.359
Caption: the key thing which is something that

00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:55.280
Caption: doesn&#39;t necessarily definitely applies

00:20:53.359 --> 00:20:57.439
Caption: to it but you may not necessarily have

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.840
Caption: experienced before is that you need to

00:20:57.439 --> 00:21:01.759
Caption: understand the salaries before you get

00:20:59.839 --> 00:21:03.678
Caption: to those conversations

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.839
Caption: you normally need to actually give what

00:21:03.678 --> 00:21:08.558
Caption: sort of salary expectations you&#39;re after

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:10.319
Caption: rather than being prompted and asked and

00:21:08.558 --> 00:21:12.158
Caption: that&#39;s something that i was definitely

00:21:10.319 --> 00:21:14.000
Caption: not comfortable with and really needed

00:21:12.159 --> 00:21:16.159
Caption: to have research before i found myself

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.439
Caption: in that position and i&#39;m very lucky that

00:21:16.159 --> 00:21:19.440
Caption: someone warned me about that

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:25.279
Caption: so next up i really want to go through

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.280
Caption: understanding what you want

00:21:26.239 --> 00:21:30.959
Caption: because i had

00:21:27.839 --> 00:21:32.558
Caption: gone through a transition and i had a

00:21:30.959 --> 00:21:34.719
Caption: variety of different experience and

00:21:32.558 --> 00:21:35.599
Caption: technical skills under my belt

00:21:34.719 --> 00:21:38.400
Caption: i

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:42.640
Caption: kind of didn&#39;t want exactly coding all

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:45.200
Caption: day at a junior level i didn&#39;t want just

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.039
Caption: talking about this application i wanted

00:21:45.199 --> 00:21:48.719
Caption: to find a way to combine the different

00:21:47.038 --> 00:21:50.639
Caption: things that i liked

00:21:48.719 --> 00:21:52.239
Caption: and to be honest i wasn&#39;t very good at

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.959
Caption: communicating how that was going to work

00:21:52.239 --> 00:21:55.599
Caption: out

00:21:52.959 --> 00:21:57.839
Caption: i was fortunate enough to be set up on a

00:21:55.599 --> 00:22:00.400
Caption: coffee date with someone who

00:21:57.839 --> 00:22:02.079
Caption: worked in a technical role but not

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.359
Caption: really related at all to what i did in

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:07.359
Caption: i.t to help tease out of me how and what

00:22:05.359 --> 00:22:09.280
Caption: on earth i was talking about so i could

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:12.319
Caption: have those conversations

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:14.320
Caption: and i was taken through this exercise

00:22:12.319 --> 00:22:16.479
Caption: that i did for myself and i want to talk

00:22:14.319 --> 00:22:18.479
Caption: to you about because it&#39;s made such a

00:22:16.479 --> 00:22:20.319
Caption: big difference for me

00:22:18.479 --> 00:22:21.599
Caption: so there&#39;s a few things to think about

00:22:20.319 --> 00:22:24.319
Caption: with any role

00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:26.400
Caption: first off if title or what the actual

00:22:24.319 --> 00:22:27.839
Caption: role is called is important to you

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.839
Caption: uh if you

00:22:27.839 --> 00:22:31.599
Caption: care about having an idea of what sort

00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:32.640
Caption: of salary you&#39;re expecting

00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:34.558
Caption: and

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.799
Caption: from there think about the boss that you

00:22:34.558 --> 00:22:38.959
Caption: want to work with and this is where

00:22:36.798 --> 00:22:40.959
Caption: this advice sort of changes a little bit

00:22:38.959 --> 00:22:42.959
Caption: so this is do you want to mentor at this

00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:44.558
Caption: stage in your career do you want a boss

00:22:42.959 --> 00:22:46.719
Caption: that just leaves you alone and lets you

00:22:44.558 --> 00:22:48.959
Caption: decide what you do this is this is a

00:22:46.719 --> 00:22:50.319
Caption: personal thing um

00:22:48.959 --> 00:22:52.880
Caption: next off is what do you want your team

00:22:50.319 --> 00:22:54.959
Caption: to be like for me i wanted to be around

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.640
Caption: other technical people who were

00:22:54.959 --> 00:22:58.640
Caption: constantly challenging themselves and

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.959
Caption: sharing new technical discoveries and

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.280
Caption: that was what was key for me

00:23:00.959 --> 00:23:06.399
Caption: the other thing is location this is more

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:08.080
Caption: and more port important in a

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.919
Caption: covered world then we&#39;ve gotten used to

00:23:08.079 --> 00:23:11.918
Caption: working from home if you need to have

00:23:09.918 --> 00:23:13.279
Caption: some work from home or a distance from

00:23:11.918 --> 00:23:14.079
Caption: the office

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.640
Caption: right

00:23:14.079 --> 00:23:18.158
Caption: have a think about that and lastly is

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.119
Caption: what are your day-to-day duties what

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:22.400
Caption: does your ideal day look like to you

00:23:21.119 --> 00:23:24.158
Caption: so for me

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.559
Caption: it was a matter of writing these things

00:23:24.159 --> 00:23:28.400
Caption: down even though not all of these things

00:23:26.558 --> 00:23:29.918
Caption: were exactly important to me

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.760
Caption: i knew what was

00:23:29.918 --> 00:23:34.399
Caption: and having it there

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.479
Caption: once i knew my day-to-day boss colleague

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.559
Caption: situation i was far more prepared to

00:23:36.479 --> 00:23:40.558
Caption: have conversations about with possible

00:23:38.558 --> 00:23:41.918
Caption: employers or recruiters about what i

00:23:40.558 --> 00:23:43.439
Caption: really wanted

00:23:41.918 --> 00:23:46.158
Caption: the next step in going through this

00:23:43.439 --> 00:23:47.759
Caption: process is keeping this just for you but

00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:50.320
Caption: then also writing the same thing down

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.640
Caption: about where you want to be in two five

00:23:50.319 --> 00:23:54.798
Caption: years what it might be for you for me it

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.880
Caption: was two years and i wrote this down

00:23:54.798 --> 00:23:59.119
Caption: again and kept that i&#39;ve kept that on

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.119
Caption: hand

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:02.640
Caption: so

00:24:00.479 --> 00:24:05.599
Caption: all this advice sounds amazing tailored

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.039
Caption: just to me so i want to tell you about

00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:09.278
Caption: finding mentors

00:24:07.038 --> 00:24:12.319
Caption: so the first step is obviously to get

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:14.159
Caption: out and meet some people now

00:24:12.319 --> 00:24:15.759
Caption: i was talking about going to events but

00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:17.840
Caption: realistically it&#39;s just about getting

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.520
Caption: involved in something in the community

00:24:17.839 --> 00:24:21.439
Caption: that can be online and there&#39;s plenty of

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.400
Caption: local based online things during these

00:24:21.439 --> 00:24:23.839
Caption: times

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.359
Caption: but it&#39;s actually just getting out and

00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:27.520
Caption: getting involved

00:24:25.359 --> 00:24:29.439
Caption: for any women in technology or entering

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.359
Caption: technology in australia i need to shout

00:24:29.439 --> 00:24:33.038

00:24:31.359 --> 00:24:34.158
Caption: were integral in the beginning of my

00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:37.439
Caption: journey

00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:39.039
Caption: and also technical meet-ups which are

00:24:37.439 --> 00:24:41.359
Caption: a little bit scary and daunting if

00:24:39.038 --> 00:24:43.439
Caption: you&#39;re just learning that technology but

00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:45.359
Caption: are an amazing place to find people that

00:24:43.439 --> 00:24:47.439
Caption: are excited about their technology and

00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:49.760
Caption: want to talk about it

00:24:47.439 --> 00:24:51.199
Caption: from here work this can be pretty

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.320
Caption: obvious but i&#39;m going to call it out

00:24:51.199 --> 00:24:55.760
Caption: friends and friends of friends your

Caption: of people you might want to hang around

00:24:57.199 --> 00:25:00.719
Caption: with and they may know people that are

00:24:59.439 --> 00:25:01.759
Caption: connected in that space that you want to

00:25:00.719 --> 00:25:03.038
Caption: do

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.558
Caption: get a feel

00:25:03.038 --> 00:25:07.199
Caption: you&#39;d be surprised

00:25:04.558 --> 00:25:08.558
Caption: and the last thing is technical people

00:25:07.199 --> 00:25:10.239
Caption: are everywhere

00:25:08.558 --> 00:25:12.399
Caption: so

00:25:10.239 --> 00:25:13.678

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.678

Caption: little bit about me and found out that i

00:25:36.798 --> 00:25:41.678

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.400

Caption: spent her career in it and was quite

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:52.240
Caption: involved in different community things

00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:54.239
Caption: we sat down and she

00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:56.239
Caption: first off introduced me to the person

00:25:54.239 --> 00:25:58.000

Caption: conversations

Caption: from here

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.479
Caption: making these connections this is around

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.039
Caption: twitter as an appropriate place to

00:27:07.439 --> 00:27:11.278

00:27:09.038 --> 00:27:13.839
Caption: people you meet with

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:14.960

00:27:13.839 --> 00:27:17.839
Caption: mentors

00:27:14.959 --> 00:27:19.918
Caption: it&#39;s for me it&#39;s around having lots

00:27:17.839 --> 00:27:22.640
Caption: of people that i can ask questions i

00:27:19.918 --> 00:27:24.000
Caption: don&#39;t use the formal mental word with a

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.000
Caption: lot of these people

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.678
Caption: and honestly some of the advice i&#39;ve

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.520
Caption: already called out has come off from

00:27:27.678 --> 00:27:30.479
Caption: single conversations

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.719
Caption: but

00:27:30.479 --> 00:27:34.880
Caption: really they did mentor me

00:27:32.719 --> 00:27:36.959
Caption: so when i

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.039

00:27:36.959 --> 00:27:41.678

Caption: can make it clear that it&#39;s something

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:47.039
Caption: they can be comfortable with i&#39;m not

00:27:45.279 --> 00:27:48.880
Caption: going to ask them something that&#39;s going

00:27:47.038 --> 00:27:50.479
Caption: to put them in an uncomfortable position

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.839
Caption: about things that go on with their

00:27:50.479 --> 00:27:55.760
