  "description": "AI for Earth: Using machine learning to monitor, model, and manage natural resources\\n\\nThe AI for Earth program applies machine learning and data science to hard challenges in agriculture, water, climate, and biodiversity.  In this talk, we will discuss how the AI for Earth team, Microsoft Research, and AI for Earth grant recipients are using machine learning to enable precision agriculture, to predict outbreaks of disease, to detect poachers in real time, and to classify animals for conservation.  Finally, we will briefly provide details on the AI for Earth grant program to obtain resources for everyone to work on these challenges.  \\n\\nJennifer Marsman is the Principal Software Engineer of Microsoft\u2019s \u201CAI for Earth\u201D group, where she uses data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to aid with clean water, agriculture, biodiversity, and climate change.  Jennifer is a frequent speaker at software development conferences around the world.  Since 2016, Jennifer was recognized as one of the \u201Ctop 100 most influential individuals in artificial intelligence and machine learning\u201D by Onalytica, reaching the #2 slot in 2018.  She has been featured in Bloomberg for her work using EEG and machine learning to perform lie detection.  In 2009, Jennifer was chosen as \\"
