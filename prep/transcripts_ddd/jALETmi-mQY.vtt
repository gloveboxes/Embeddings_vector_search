Caption: this conference i&#39;m really excited to be

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.039
Caption: part of it this year

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.520
Caption: and yeah thank you for joining me so

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.120
Caption: hello my name is haley

Caption: feel free to check me to follow on

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:43.360
Caption: twitter i tweet a lot about coding fails

00:00:42.238 --> 00:00:44.959
Caption: my dog

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.039
Caption: uh and mental health so if you&#39;re

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:48.319
Caption: interested in any of those things um

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.520
Caption: please say hi to me on twitter i&#39;d love

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.919
Caption: to chat with you

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.159
Caption: um outside of twitter i&#39;m the tech lead

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:56.799
Caption: for she codes so she codes is a social

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.078
Caption: enterprise that&#39;s under the child it&#39;s a

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.078
Caption: child of space cubed which is a

00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:01.840
Caption: co-working space here in the city

00:01:00.078 --> 00:01:04.000
Caption: and our role at shecodes is to try and

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.839
Caption: increase the number of women in tech so

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.279
Caption: we have a very lofty goal of trying to

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:10.319
Caption: inspire 100 000 women into tech by 2025

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:12.319
Caption: which is

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:13.439
Caption: sneaking up on us very very quickly um

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:16.158
Caption: but it&#39;s something that we&#39;re really

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.560
Caption: excited about so my job at shecodes is

00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:21.199
Caption: the tech lead it&#39;s technically not in a

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:23.599
Caption: typical sense so i don&#39;t lead a team of

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:25.438
Caption: developers but rather i lead a small

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:27.599
Caption: army of mentors

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.079
Caption: that we are training to then teach other

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.839
Caption: people how to get into tech so we train

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.759
Caption: mentors who are developers in the

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:35.599
Caption: community here to so that they can be

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.040
Caption: better mentors for budding developers or

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:39.360
Caption: junior developers

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.040
Caption: so that&#39;s part of my job i also write a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.439
Caption: bunch of educational content about

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.559
Caption: computer science and programming so i&#39;m

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.079
Caption: the one who puts together most of our

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:47.279
Caption: workshops and i teach most of our

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.119
Caption: workshops

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:51.519
Caption: and generally i just love computer

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.240
Caption: science and education and all things

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:56.398
Caption: around that so i&#39;ve been doing this for

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:59.919
Caption: basically my whole career i&#39;ve been

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.680
Caption: either in tech or in uh education but

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.879
Caption: almost always i&#39;m in a cross section

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.559
Caption: between the two

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:05.758
Caption: um because whenever i pick one i end up

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:07.758
Caption: missing the other so i&#39;ve just kind of

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.720
Caption: landed in the middle

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.760
Caption: so

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.080
Caption: hopefully it&#39;s uh coming across by now

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.439
Caption: um how much i love education and tech

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.878
Caption: and computer science and i hope you&#39;re

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.919
Caption: already super intrigued by what&#39;s going

00:02:16.878 --> 00:02:20.080
Caption: on in front of me because we&#39;re going to

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:22.399
Caption: do a bit of everything today

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.400
Caption: so that leads me here so why am i giving

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:27.519
Caption: a talk about the computer science uh

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:28.319
Caption: behind color um there are a few reasons

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.040
Caption: so

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.559
Caption: the most superficial is just i&#39;m such a

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:35.199
Caption: nerd about this stuff i just find this

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:36.800
Caption: really really fascinating um and i

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.319
Caption: figured it was interesting so surely

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.160
Caption: somebody else would find it interesting

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.759
Caption: too and so ddd i thought was a really

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.518
Caption: good conference to submit this to since

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.439
Caption: you have to vote the talk in and you did

00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:47.199
Caption: so clearly at least you know two people

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.839
Caption: found this interesting um so thank you

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:51.199
Caption: for voting

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:52.479
Caption: um and the but the main reason that i

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:54.479
Caption: wanted to give this talk other than i&#39;m

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.238
Caption: just a bit of a nerd about it is i have

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.319
Caption: spent a considerable portion of my

00:02:56.238 --> 00:03:00.000
Caption: career working with people who are new

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.360
Caption: to tech so whether they&#39;re new

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.360
Caption: developers or people who are just

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.958
Caption: generally not quite comfortable using

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.720
Caption: their computer yet

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.399
Caption: and so that experience has taught me

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.399
Caption: that there are some remarkable

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:12.799
Caption: misconceptions that exist about our

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:14.479
Caption: industry and more specifically today

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.919
Caption: computers themselves

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:17.518
Caption: so a lot of people struggle with

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.360
Caption: confidence when they start learning how

00:03:17.518 --> 00:03:21.598
Caption: to how to code or even just learning how

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.759
Caption: to use a new tool on their computer and

00:03:21.598 --> 00:03:25.759
Caption: so many people have this idea that

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.839
Caption: computers are these magical all-knowing

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:31.439
Caption: beings and that they&#39;ll shame us if we

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:34.878
Caption: make a mistake but this is absolutely

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.839
Caption: not the case in fact computers are super

00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:37.759
Caption: dumb

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:40.080
Caption: they are just

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:41.919
Caption: super dumb boxes of middle there is

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.919
Caption: literally nothing else to them

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.199
Caption: they are absolute perfectionist as the

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.798
Caption: developers in the room will know you

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.878
Caption: miss a semicolon they fall apart they

00:03:46.798 --> 00:03:50.238
Caption: have a tantrum sometimes they get cranky

00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:51.440
Caption: if they haven&#39;t had enough sleep and you

00:03:50.238 --> 00:03:53.199
Caption: just have to turn them off and on again

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.438
Caption: to fix them like seriously these things

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.559
Caption: are not smart and we put way too much we

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:58.000
Caption: just give them way too much kudos

00:03:56.559 --> 00:04:00.319
Caption: sometimes

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.839
Caption: so they&#39;re boxes of metal they literally

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.639
Caption: know nothing other than what we tell

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:04.798
Caption: them

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:08.000
Caption: um but that&#39;s also actually what makes

00:04:04.798 --> 00:04:10.479
Caption: them useful so using computers does make

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.679
Caption: our lives easier for the most part but

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:17.040
Caption: that is absolutely not an accident

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:19.199
Caption: so humans build computers for humans so

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.919
Caption: they exist to solve our problems that is

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.839
Caption: that is exactly why they exist and

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.199
Caption: nothing about the way that they work is

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:27.440
Caption: a coincidence

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.399
Caption: which is why i wanted to talk about

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.239
Caption: color

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:33.040
Caption: so today i&#39;m going to take you on a

00:04:30.239 --> 00:04:34.479
Caption: little journey about uh to prove to you

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.759
Caption: that the way color works on a computer

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.919
Caption: and the way computers work it&#39;s not a

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.839
Caption: coincidence at all it&#39;s in fact very

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.600
Caption: clever it&#39;s very smart humans were the

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:43.679
Caption: ones who came up with it and it benefits

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.040
Caption: us humans greatly

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:46.720
Caption: so

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.399
Caption: what are we actually going to talk about

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.040
Caption: today um we&#39;ll start with there&#39;s going

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:52.720
Caption: to be a lot of emoji

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.080
Caption: so

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.759
Caption: my advice to you right now would be get

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:57.039
Caption: really comfy there is way more in this

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.639
Caption: than you would think which is why this

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.839
Caption: is a 45 minute talk and i feel like i

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.279
Caption: could have added three more days to it

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:03.600
Caption: if i really wanted to

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:05.440
Caption: so we&#39;re going to talk about how mixing

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.880
Caption: colors work which you might have figured

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.959
Caption: out based on the fact that there is

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.720
Caption: paint in front of me right now

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:12.479
Caption: we&#39;re also going to look at the physics

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.559
Caption: of light which you may have noticed

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.399
Caption: there are some torches on the table in

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.759
Caption: front of me as well

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.919
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk a little bit about

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.519
Caption: biology so we&#39;re going to understand a

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.199
Caption: little bit more about how our eyes work

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:25.679
Caption: and how that lets us perceive different

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.720
Caption: colors and then we&#39;re going to bring

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:28.160
Caption: that together with a little bit of

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.600
Caption: computer science so computer science is

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.519
Caption: going to tie those things together for

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.399
Caption: us and eventually we&#39;re going to look at

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:36.319
Caption: how color codes work in css

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:38.399
Caption: so those things that we type in our css

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.600
Caption: files or our designers use we&#39;re going

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:41.919
Caption: to have a look at how those things

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.839
Caption: actually work and how all of this

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.720
Caption: came to end up as some code that we can

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.720
Caption: write in css

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:50.959
Caption: so

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:52.639
Caption: i always i tend to give workshops more

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:54.319
Caption: than i give talks and so my workshops

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.839
Caption: are always super interactive and so i

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.479
Caption: kind of couldn&#39;t help myself and so

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:59.519
Caption: that&#39;s why well this is with me today um

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.039
Caption: so

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:03.119
Caption: for this talk i would love for you to

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.600
Caption: put yourself in or to start with at

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:07.440
Caption: least in the mindset of a kindergarten

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.199
Caption: student so imagine you&#39;re four or five

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.839
Caption: six years old and you&#39;re learning about

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.520
Caption: paints and colors for the first time

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.959
Caption: but then we&#39;re quickly gonna ramp up so

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:16.479
Caption: we&#39;re gonna start at kindergarten and

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:17.759
Caption: we&#39;re gonna go probably as far as first

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.360
Caption: year uni when we get to the computer

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.440
Caption: science stuff so like we&#39;re covering

00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:25.279
Caption: quite a range here today

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.160
Caption: now speaking of um kindergarten

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.279
Caption: uh

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.639
Caption: i think we should start playing with

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:29.440
Caption: some paint

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.119
Caption: uh

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.479
Caption: so i&#39;m just i&#39;m just a little bit too

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.160
Caption: excited so i&#39;m just gonna start getting

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.399
Caption: into the paint i think all right let&#39;s

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.639
Caption: do this so paint think back to

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:40.160
Caption: kindergarten or primary school you might

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:41.839
Caption: you might remember about learning about

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.399
Caption: mixing paints and this thing called a

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.399
Caption: color wheel

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.639
Caption: so the idea of a color wheel is to show

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.559
Caption: how colors relate to each other so i

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.559
Caption: found a simple color wheel

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:54.000
Caption: with the idea it shows how one color

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:56.479
Caption: might slowly transition to the other

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.799
Caption: until you&#39;ve done a full 360. but then i

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.720
Caption: thought that&#39;s super boring and paint&#39;s

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:01.679
Caption: super fun so let&#39;s do this with paint

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.360
Caption: instead

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:05.440
Caption: so i brought

00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:07.198
Caption: some paint with me today

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.279
Caption: and i would just like to get some

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.919
Caption: expectations cleared up right now i&#39;m

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:14.000
Caption: not an artist in any way i am no bob

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:16.639
Caption: ross whatever you&#39;re expecting like

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Caption: lower your standards considerably it&#39;s

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:20.240
Caption: blobs we&#39;re just going for some blobs

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.359
Caption: that&#39;s all we&#39;re doing today

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:24.559
Caption: okay i brought some uh

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:27.198
Caption: red

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:29.519
Caption: yellow and blue paint with me

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:30.800
Caption: but the problem is when you&#39;re painting

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:32.239
Caption: uh

00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:33.440
Caption: i know nothing about paint but i assume

00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:35.359
Caption: that often you want more than three

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.720
Caption: colors but i only have these three

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:38.559
Caption: colors with me just gonna hide that

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.160
Caption: black one for now i only have these

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:42.160
Caption: three colors with me

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.319
Caption: but fortunately because i know about

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.080
Caption: this thing called the color wheel i

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:49.039
Caption: could use these colors

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:50.559
Caption: to make new colors if i wanted to so

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:53.598
Caption: i&#39;m going to get mixing

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:54.878
Caption: so i&#39;m going to put a little bit of blue

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:56.559
Caption: and can you tell i&#39;ve already used it

00:07:54.878 --> 00:07:58.399
Caption: like my fingers are blue already so i&#39;m

00:07:56.559 --> 00:08:00.959
Caption: going to put a little bit of blue in

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:00.959
Caption: this bowl

00:08:02.239 --> 00:08:05.679
Caption: i just really like this shirt and i

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.360
Caption: don&#39;t want paint on it because i&#39;m just

00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:08.959
Caption: going to stand like this okay so i&#39;ve

00:08:07.359 --> 00:08:10.239
Caption: got a little bit of blue a little bit of

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:11.199
Caption: yellow

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:13.839
Caption: and then i&#39;m just going to go ahead and

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.839
Caption: mix these up

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:20.559
Caption: so when i mix these i get green

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.079
Caption: i&#39;m i&#39;m really hoping that this wasn&#39;t

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:23.119
Caption: particularly shocking but i also know

00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:25.039
Caption: that i told you to think like you&#39;re a

00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:26.559
Caption: kindergarten student so maybe this is so

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:29.679
Caption: i mixed in blue and yellow and i got

00:08:26.559 --> 00:08:31.359
Caption: green cool what else can i do

00:08:29.679 --> 00:08:33.119
Caption: and apologies

00:08:31.359 --> 00:08:35.518
Caption: for the smell of paint

00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:37.679
Caption: that is going to fill this room

00:08:35.518 --> 00:08:39.679
Caption: it&#39;s a lot alright so

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:43.919
Caption: next i&#39;m going to mix some yellow and

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:43.919
Caption: red so i can get my yellow

00:08:44.719 --> 00:08:47.599
Caption: and some red

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:56.958

Caption: well it&#39;s pretty mind-blowing right like

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:08.640
Caption: i&#39;m having fun like

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.720
Caption: okay the last combination that i&#39;m gonna

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.480
Caption: do is my red and blue which already has

00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:14.159
Caption: some green on it so you know i&#39;m off to

00:09:12.479 --> 00:09:15.838
Caption: a really good start

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:17.599
Caption: okay

00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:20.239
Caption: i&#39;m just the goal is to not get any on

00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:23.199
Caption: my laptop but

00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:24.640
Caption: it&#39;s gonna happen all right so i got the

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.359
Caption: telstra

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.519
Caption: i&#39;m sure that would be uh oh like but

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:31.200
Caption: i mean i don&#39;t have to come back so that

00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:32.159
Caption: doesn&#39;t sound like my problem

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.040
Caption: all right

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:36.479
Caption: so

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:39.278
Caption: i&#39;m gonna mix my red and blue

00:09:36.479 --> 00:09:39.278
Caption: and i get a purple

00:09:39.518 --> 00:09:43.200
Caption: cool pretty dark purple these are pretty

00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.239
Caption: dark um colors that i&#39;m starting with

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.919
Caption: cool

00:09:44.239 --> 00:09:47.919
Caption: so i&#39;m going to put that down for a

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:49.760
Caption: moment before i get that on me again

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:51.599
Caption: all right so these three colors that i&#39;m

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.919
Caption: using to create new colors at the moment

00:09:51.599 --> 00:09:56.398
Caption: uh we would call them primary colors and

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:58.958
Caption: they&#39;re actually the prime oh i&#39;m some

00:09:56.398 --> 00:10:00.559
Caption: pretty diagrams my apologies and these

00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:03.359
Caption: are actually the primary colors from the

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:06.880
Caption: ryb color model just very creatively

00:10:03.359 --> 00:10:09.440
Caption: named ryb red yellow blue

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.278
Caption: now a color model is any system that

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.919
Caption: uses three primary colors to create new

00:10:11.278 --> 00:10:16.559
Caption: colors as we just tested out

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:19.039
Caption: but if i wanted to so i made these

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:20.559
Caption: secondary colors if i wanted to

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:22.479
Caption: i could make some tertiary colors as

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:24.559
Caption: well so the next ones are long so if i

00:10:22.479 --> 00:10:27.278
Caption: mix a primary and a secondary i get a

00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:28.320
Caption: tertiary so i&#39;m going to mix some more

00:10:27.278 --> 00:10:30.479
Caption: blue

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.518
Caption: into my green so my green came from blue

00:10:30.479 --> 00:10:33.679
Caption: and yellow

00:10:31.518 --> 00:10:35.760
Caption: and it&#39;s now a secondary and if i add a

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:37.359
Caption: little bit more blue to it

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.919
Caption: this is so much more paint on my hands

00:10:37.359 --> 00:10:42.640
Caption: than i was expecting today

00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:44.239
Caption: and then i mix this up

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.320
Caption: then i&#39;m going to get like a teal kind

00:10:44.239 --> 00:10:48.398
Caption: of you call it teal yeah i feel like

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.278
Caption: it&#39;s still

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:53.359
Caption: so i&#39;ve just created another color now

00:10:51.278 --> 00:10:55.119
Caption: so from the three colors that i brought

00:10:53.359 --> 00:10:57.359
Caption: with me

00:10:55.119 --> 00:10:59.518
Caption: uh i have made a bunch of new colors so

00:10:57.359 --> 00:11:02.000
Caption: i made um some green which i&#39;ve turned

00:10:59.518 --> 00:11:03.200
Caption: into teal i made purple i made orange so

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.518
Caption: from that i managed to make three

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.679
Caption: secondaries in a tertiary now i could

00:11:05.518 --> 00:11:09.359
Caption: keep going but i won&#39;t don&#39;t worry um

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:11.440
Caption: but i could keep going and make as many

00:11:09.359 --> 00:11:13.838
Caption: colors as i wanted

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.838
Caption: within reason and the extent of all the

00:11:13.838 --> 00:11:17.760
Caption: colors or all the possible colors that i

00:11:15.838 --> 00:11:20.799
Caption: could make is called a gamut

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.160
Caption: so when no matter what i uh what i mix

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:23.838
Caption: when if i use these three paints

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:25.518
Caption: whatever colors i make all the

00:11:23.838 --> 00:11:26.838
Caption: possibilities collectively that&#39;s called

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:29.919
Caption: a gamut of

00:11:26.838 --> 00:11:31.760
Caption: colors but if i say change one of these

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:33.278
Caption: paints so if i decided i didn&#39;t like

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.958
Caption: this yellow and i swapped it out for a

00:11:33.278 --> 00:11:36.799
Caption: different brand or just a slightly

00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:38.078
Caption: different shade then that&#39;ll affect the

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:39.679
Caption: colors that i can make and so that would

00:11:38.078 --> 00:11:41.278
Caption: change my gamut and i would be able to

00:11:39.679 --> 00:11:43.039
Caption: make a slightly different gamut of

00:11:41.278 --> 00:11:44.880
Caption: colors

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:46.719
Caption: okay cool story haley where are you

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.239
Caption: going with this

00:11:46.719 --> 00:11:49.679
Caption: i want to say before i get too carried

00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:52.638
Caption: away with playing with paint but like

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:53.440
Caption: i&#39;m having a great time so we&#39;re there

00:11:52.638 --> 00:11:54.398
Caption: um

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.838
Caption: let&#39;s

00:11:54.398 --> 00:11:58.479
Caption: let&#39;s take a step back and try and

00:11:55.838 --> 00:12:00.398
Caption: understand uh why we can even see these

00:11:58.479 --> 00:12:02.239
Caption: colors in the first place

00:12:00.398 --> 00:12:03.679
Caption: so we&#39;re gonna have to get just a little

00:12:02.239 --> 00:12:04.958
Caption: bit physically to understand what&#39;s

00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:07.039
Caption: going on here so we&#39;re done with

00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.239
Caption: kindergarten now we&#39;re moving on up

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:10.398
Caption: so

00:12:08.239 --> 00:12:11.919
Caption: i want you to think about light

00:12:10.398 --> 00:12:13.679
Caption: uh specifically

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:15.518
Caption: maybe the light coming from these bowls

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:17.440
Caption: or the light bouncing off these bowls so

00:12:15.518 --> 00:12:20.000
Caption: when we think of light uh what we

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.200
Caption: actually mean is visible electromagnetic

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.958
Caption: radiation

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.880
Caption: which is a

00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:27.119
Caption: very fancy word from a very fancy

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.599
Caption: physics idea that basically is referring

00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:31.679
Caption: to the electromagnetic spectrum which is

00:12:29.599 --> 00:12:33.838
Caption: the range of frequencies covered by

00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:35.278
Caption: electromagnetic radiation and it&#39;s

00:12:33.838 --> 00:12:38.398
Caption: broken down by different bands of

00:12:35.278 --> 00:12:41.919
Caption: frequencies so gamma x-ray uv visible

00:12:38.398 --> 00:12:41.919
Caption: infrared microwave radio

00:12:42.239 --> 00:12:46.078
Caption: so

00:12:43.119 --> 00:12:47.359
Caption: the radiation travels in waves all these

00:12:46.078 --> 00:12:49.838
Caption: things are traveling these things called

00:12:47.359 --> 00:12:52.638
Caption: waves so when we say frequency we&#39;re

00:12:49.838 --> 00:12:53.919
Caption: actually referring to how fast a wave is

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:55.518
Caption: moving so

00:12:53.919 --> 00:12:56.958
Caption: uh we&#39;ve got

00:12:55.518 --> 00:12:59.440
Caption: faster waves down here we&#39;ve got solar

00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.880
Caption: waves on the right

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.479
Caption: now if you&#39;re

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.838
Caption: uh oh and this is an example just to

00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:04.880
Caption: help you visualize it just you know if

00:13:03.838 --> 00:13:07.518
Caption: you didn&#39;t know what a wave looked like

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.440
Caption: here you go um so if you&#39;re interested

00:13:07.518 --> 00:13:11.039
Caption: the more detailed explanation is that

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.359
Caption: we&#39;re measuring how many wavelengths

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:15.599
Caption: past a fixed point in a specific period

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:18.398
Caption: of time a wavelength being the distance

00:13:15.599 --> 00:13:21.119
Caption: between uh two points so two crests or

00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:23.838
Caption: two peaks in a wave

00:13:21.119 --> 00:13:26.239
Caption: now back to the spectrum so uh on the

00:13:23.838 --> 00:13:29.039
Caption: spectrum uh visible light so stuff that

00:13:26.239 --> 00:13:30.398
Caption: we as humans can see is super super tiny

00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:33.838
Caption: so we can only see this little little

00:13:30.398 --> 00:13:35.760
Caption: tiny patch in the middle but inside that

00:13:33.838 --> 00:13:37.359
Caption: inside that little range on the

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.000
Caption: electromagnetic spectrum there&#39;s

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:42.159
Caption: actually still a decent range of waves

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.760
Caption: so

00:13:42.159 --> 00:13:46.958
Caption: these different wavelengths are actually

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:49.518
Caption: what influence our perception of color

00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:51.760
Caption: so when we experience seeing red we&#39;re

00:13:49.518 --> 00:13:53.518
Caption: seeing a long wavelength and when we&#39;re

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.040
Caption: experiencing

00:13:53.518 --> 00:13:57.359
Caption: violence we&#39;re seeing a shorter

00:13:55.039 --> 00:13:59.518
Caption: wavelength relatively speaking

00:13:57.359 --> 00:14:02.239
Caption: so the frequency or the wavelength of a

00:13:59.518 --> 00:14:04.799
Caption: wave is what determines the color that

00:14:02.239 --> 00:14:06.398
Caption: we actually see

00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:09.039
Caption: but what is the connection between those

00:14:06.398 --> 00:14:10.880
Caption: waves and this paint

00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:12.958
Caption: well at the moment

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.359
Caption: i have a white canvas

00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:17.119
Caption: and this canvas is reflecting every

00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:18.958
Caption: single wavelength of light equally which

00:14:17.119 --> 00:14:19.838
Caption: is why i see it as white

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.479
Caption: so

00:14:19.838 --> 00:14:25.039
Caption: all the visible light to us humans hits

00:14:22.479 --> 00:14:27.599
Caption: it and it bounces off equally the canvas

00:14:25.039 --> 00:14:28.958
Caption: is absorbing none of it and so we see

00:14:27.599 --> 00:14:32.000
Caption: white because that&#39;s the result of

00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:34.479
Caption: combining all of those colors together

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.440
Caption: but if i add some paint to this

00:14:34.479 --> 00:14:38.880
Caption: so if i take a little bit of

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.679
Caption: this teal

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.518
Caption: or this tertiary that we made earlier

00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:45.039
Caption: and i add some paint to my canvas well

00:14:43.518 --> 00:14:47.518
Caption: now i can see

00:14:45.039 --> 00:14:49.919
Caption: teal on my canvas i can see white and i

00:14:47.518 --> 00:14:50.880
Caption: can see teal so what&#39;s happening at this

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:53.518
Caption: point

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.160
Caption: is the paint is actually just reflecting

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:58.880
Caption: the blue and green light so

00:14:56.159 --> 00:15:00.000
Caption: this has uh yellow it&#39;s got a bit of

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.440
Caption: green

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.239
Caption: which came from yellow and blue and then

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.000
Caption: it got a bit more blue so this stripe on

00:15:04.239 --> 00:15:08.320
Caption: the canvas is just reflecting those

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.320
Caption: colors and absorbing every other color

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.278
Caption: which is why i can see it so it reflects

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:16.078
Caption: it it goes to my eyes i can see it

00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:16.078
Caption: put that back down

00:15:16.638 --> 00:15:20.880
Caption: okay

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:23.199
Caption: so what&#39;s also interesting is if i mix

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.638
Caption: all of these paints together

00:15:23.198 --> 00:15:25.838
Caption: i can get black

00:15:24.638 --> 00:15:27.679
Caption: now

00:15:25.838 --> 00:15:30.559
Caption: yesterday i covered my kitchen in

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:32.159
Caption: several different shades of nearly black

00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:34.799
Caption: and i learned that it takes quite a bit

00:15:32.159 --> 00:15:36.239
Caption: of precision to get actual perfect black

00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:38.320
Caption: so i cheat i&#39;m cheating today and i

00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:39.119
Caption: brought some black with me

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.398
Caption: um

00:15:39.119 --> 00:15:41.359
Caption: probably didn&#39;t need its own bowl but

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:43.518
Caption: there we go

00:15:41.359 --> 00:15:45.758
Caption: so i&#39;ve got some black paint here it&#39;s

00:15:43.518 --> 00:15:47.758
Caption: very black i i came really close but i

00:15:45.758 --> 00:15:50.159
Caption: just couldn&#39;t quite get it so when i put

00:15:47.758 --> 00:15:52.638
Caption: black paint on my canvas now

00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:54.638
Caption: this is now the total opposite to white

00:15:52.638 --> 00:15:56.799
Caption: so white reflects every single

00:15:54.638 --> 00:15:59.198
Caption: wavelength and so when those colors

00:15:56.799 --> 00:16:01.359
Caption: combine we see that as white meanwhile

00:15:59.198 --> 00:16:03.679
Caption: black is absorbing every single

00:16:01.359 --> 00:16:05.119
Caption: wavelength

00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:07.359
Caption: so in other words it&#39;s not actually

00:16:05.119 --> 00:16:08.638
Caption: reflecting any color so stuff&#39;s hitting

00:16:07.359 --> 00:16:10.479
Caption: the black and it&#39;s been completely

00:16:08.638 --> 00:16:12.239
Caption: absorbed and i can&#39;t see it anymore so

00:16:10.479 --> 00:16:14.880
Caption: it&#39;s there is no color for me to see

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:17.198
Caption: there the black is absorbing it

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.638
Caption: so this process where i start with a

00:16:17.198 --> 00:16:20.479
Caption: white canvas

00:16:18.638 --> 00:16:22.719
Caption: and i&#39;ve added paint to it this is

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:24.320
Caption: called subtractive color mixing so i

00:16:22.719 --> 00:16:26.319
Caption: started with a surface that reflects

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.919
Caption: every single color and i slowly took

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.000
Caption: away from it so i added some teal and i

00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:32.000
Caption: added some black so this is subtractive

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.518
Caption: start with lots of color slowly remove

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.638
Caption: it

00:16:33.518 --> 00:16:35.599
Caption: okay

00:16:34.638 --> 00:16:37.679
Caption: cool

00:16:35.599 --> 00:16:40.479
Caption: so

00:16:37.679 --> 00:16:42.078
Caption: let me skip ahead a few here we go

00:16:40.479 --> 00:16:43.599
Caption: um

00:16:42.078 --> 00:16:44.880
Caption: so i&#39;ve talked a little bit about how

00:16:43.599 --> 00:16:46.638
Caption: light moves around we&#39;ve looked at how

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.320
Caption: paint mixes together so what is the

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:49.919
Caption: connection between

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.679
Caption: uh when i say that reflects off and it

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:53.919
Caption: goes to our eyes what do i actually mean

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:55.518
Caption: like how do we actually see this thing

00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:57.119
Caption: so we&#39;re gonna go into a little bit of

00:16:55.518 --> 00:16:59.440
Caption: biology now

00:16:57.119 --> 00:17:01.359
Caption: so this is what an

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.758
Caption: this is what an eye looks like

00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:05.520
Caption: um so if you look like really deeply

00:17:03.758 --> 00:17:07.198
Caption: into your partner&#39;s eyes this is what

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.119
Caption: you&#39;ll see

00:17:07.198 --> 00:17:10.880
Caption: and there are several different

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:12.318
Caption: interesting parts of the eye so at the

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.678
Caption: front we have this iris so that&#39;s the

00:17:12.318 --> 00:17:15.359
Caption: colorful part of the eye so if your eyes

00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:17.198
Caption: blue or brown or green or whatever that

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:19.760
Caption: part&#39;s called the iris

00:17:17.198 --> 00:17:21.038
Caption: inside the iris is the pupil um that&#39;s a

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.640
Caption: little black spot in the middle i think

00:17:21.038 --> 00:17:24.479
Caption: of it as the hole that sucks in all the

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.239
Caption: light um

00:17:24.479 --> 00:17:27.520
Caption: so that is inside the iris so inside

00:17:26.239 --> 00:17:29.038
Caption: that colorful part that little hole in

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.440
Caption: the middle that&#39;s the pupil

00:17:29.038 --> 00:17:32.959
Caption: in front of the iris is the cornea so

00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:35.119
Caption: the iris and the pupil have a really

00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:36.079
Caption: important job of letting light in and so

00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:37.760
Caption: in front of them they have this thing

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:40.479
Caption: called a cornea which is a protective

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:43.119
Caption: layer so the cornea stops uh any like

00:17:40.479 --> 00:17:44.959
Caption: dust or germs or just any particles that

00:17:43.119 --> 00:17:47.520
Caption: you don&#39;t want in your eye the cornea is

00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:49.359
Caption: what stops them from getting in there

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.520
Caption: on the other side of the iris on the

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:53.520
Caption: inside of the eye is the lens

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.599
Caption: and so the cornea and the lens actually

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.599
Caption: work together to focus on things at

00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:59.280
Caption: different distances so when they work

00:17:57.599 --> 00:18:00.959
Caption: together well that&#39;s what lets you see

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.320
Caption: say your hand right in front of you and

00:18:00.959 --> 00:18:03.279
Caption: your friend on the other side of the

00:18:02.319 --> 00:18:05.279
Caption: room

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:08.000
Caption: so the way they do that is they bend or

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:11.359
Caption: refract light so that it goes into your

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Caption: eye and it hits the retina

00:18:11.359 --> 00:18:16.239
Caption: so the retina is like squishy tissue

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.839
Caption: that covers the back of the eye about 60

00:18:16.239 --> 00:18:19.439
Caption: 70 of the back of your eyes covered in

00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:22.079
Caption: this thing called the retina

00:18:19.439 --> 00:18:22.879
Caption: um and the retina&#39;s job is

00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:24.558
Caption: uh

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.719
Caption: to receive light that comes from the

00:18:24.558 --> 00:18:29.678
Caption: cornea and the lens and then convert it

00:18:26.719 --> 00:18:31.520
Caption: to electrical neural impulses

00:18:29.678 --> 00:18:33.199
Caption: and then those are sent to the brain by

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.400
Caption: this thing called the optic nerve but

00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:35.599
Caption: now we&#39;re getting like a little bit too

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.119
Caption: far away so let&#39;s just come back all

00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:38.160
Caption: right the retina

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:40.400
Caption: so

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:43.760
Caption: uh

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:47.119
Caption: the retina contains millions of these uh

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.880
Caption: cells called photoreceptor cells

00:18:47.119 --> 00:18:50.798
Caption: um there are two kinds of photoreceptor

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.199
Caption: cells so we either have uh all right so

00:18:50.798 --> 00:18:54.479
Caption: we have both rods and cones um we&#39;re

00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:56.639
Caption: gonna look at each of these individually

00:18:54.479 --> 00:18:57.599
Caption: and we&#39;re gonna start with cones

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.359
Caption: so

00:18:57.599 --> 00:19:00.959
Caption: we have three kinds of cones so we&#39;re

00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:02.640
Caption: thinking about the retina it&#39;s filled

00:19:00.959 --> 00:19:05.038
Caption: with tons of cells there are two kinds

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.799
Caption: of cells one of those cells is the cones

00:19:05.038 --> 00:19:10.719
Caption: and then there are three kinds of cones

00:19:06.798 --> 00:19:11.839
Caption: so we have s m and l cones

00:19:10.719 --> 00:19:13.359
Caption: um

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:14.880
Caption: so the names aren&#39;t actually based on

00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:16.640
Caption: the size of the cone which is what i

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.239
Caption: thought when i first looked it up it

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.079
Caption: actually corresponds to the wavelengths

00:19:18.239 --> 00:19:22.558
Caption: that they&#39;re sensitive to so remember

00:19:20.079 --> 00:19:23.918
Caption: earlier when we were looking at

00:19:22.558 --> 00:19:26.399
Caption: different wavelengths to see different

00:19:23.918 --> 00:19:28.719
Caption: colors turns out our eyes are sensitive

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.440
Caption: to different wavelengths so when we say

00:19:28.719 --> 00:19:32.719
Caption: esem and alkones we mean um

00:19:31.439 --> 00:19:35.439
Caption: short

00:19:32.719 --> 00:19:37.199
Caption: uh we mean short medium and long cones

00:19:35.439 --> 00:19:41.359
Caption: and that corresponds to short medium or

00:19:37.199 --> 00:19:41.359
Caption: long wavelengths relatively speaking

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.079
Caption: so because they correspond so well to

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.080
Caption: these different colors so the blue green

00:19:46.079 --> 00:19:50.839
Caption: and red we actually tend to generalize

00:19:48.079 --> 00:19:54.000
Caption: them to blue green and red

00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:54.798
Caption: cones all right back to the paint

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.199
Caption: so

00:19:54.798 --> 00:19:59.119
Caption: i said that we could see this teal or

00:19:57.199 --> 00:20:01.279
Caption: technically its name is blue green we

00:19:59.119 --> 00:20:02.798
Caption: could see this blue green paint um

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.479
Caption: reflecting off the canvas and hitting

00:20:02.798 --> 00:20:06.399
Caption: our eyes so what&#39;s actually happening

00:20:04.479 --> 00:20:08.880
Caption: when it gets to our eyes is that

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.599
Caption: stimulating our ism in cones so they&#39;re

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.280
Caption: being stimulated uh red is not and so

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:15.038
Caption: that&#39;s what lets us see

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.799
Caption: sorry the red&#39;s not been stimulated all

00:20:15.038 --> 00:20:18.479
Caption: the long cones are not being stimulated

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:21.760
Caption: which is what lets us see that color is

00:20:18.479 --> 00:20:23.280
Caption: teal or blue green

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.320
Caption: but as an aside

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:30.400
Caption: we are not actually created all equal

00:20:26.319 --> 00:20:32.158
Caption: so not all of us see colors uh the same

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.359
Caption: so for some people

00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:35.679
Caption: some people have color vision

00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:37.439
Caption: deficiencies um otherwise known as are

00:20:35.678 --> 00:20:39.599
Caption: color blind and there is like a million

00:20:37.439 --> 00:20:41.678
Caption: different variations of what that means

00:20:39.599 --> 00:20:43.439
Caption: so some of us have trouble detecting

00:20:41.678 --> 00:20:45.519
Caption: differences between colors or we just

00:20:43.439 --> 00:20:47.839
Caption: can&#39;t detect color at all

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.760
Caption: this can happen when there are defects

00:20:47.839 --> 00:20:51.439
Caption: in the cone cells and that could be say

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.400
Caption: from surgery or it could be genetic

00:20:51.439 --> 00:20:56.158
Caption: there&#39;s a bunch of different reasons

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.320
Caption: but even if you don&#39;t have a color

00:20:56.159 --> 00:21:00.320
Caption: deficiency you still actually experience

00:20:58.319 --> 00:21:03.439
Caption: color in your own unique way

00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:05.279
Caption: so we do not all have the same number of

00:21:03.439 --> 00:21:07.199
Caption: cones so we don&#39;t all have the same

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.200
Caption: number of red green and blue cones so

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:11.599
Caption: the blue that i see might not actually

00:21:09.199 --> 00:21:13.119
Caption: be the same blue that you see

00:21:11.599 --> 00:21:15.038
Caption: um but there&#39;ll be tiny minute

00:21:13.119 --> 00:21:16.719
Caption: differences but yeah everybody sees

00:21:15.038 --> 00:21:18.719
Caption: color differently which i thought was

00:21:16.719 --> 00:21:19.760
Caption: really interesting

00:21:18.719 --> 00:21:21.599
Caption: anyway

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.479
Caption: the ism and all cones

00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:24.400
Caption: so

00:21:22.479 --> 00:21:26.959
Caption: they themselves are also not evenly

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.119
Caption: distributed so we have way more m l

00:21:26.959 --> 00:21:30.959
Caption: cones than we do s cones

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:33.038
Caption: so that is we have way more green and

00:21:30.959 --> 00:21:34.558
Caption: blue green and red cones and not very

00:21:33.038 --> 00:21:37.199
Caption: many blue cones

00:21:34.558 --> 00:21:39.279
Caption: and this is actually um relates to

00:21:37.199 --> 00:21:40.639
Caption: seeing in the dark

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.039
Caption: so

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:45.280
Caption: cone cells are sensitive to color but

00:21:43.038 --> 00:21:46.639
Caption: they are not so sensitive to light and

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.239
Caption: there is a difference

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:53.119
Caption: so this is why we have rod cells

00:21:50.239 --> 00:21:55.359
Caption: uh we have so i see we have about six to

00:21:53.119 --> 00:21:58.640
Caption: seven million cone cells but we have

00:21:55.359 --> 00:22:01.760
Caption: about 120 million rod cells and the rod

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.320
Caption: cells job is to help us see in the dark

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.479
Caption: so when we are in uh lower levels of

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:08.798
Caption: light we&#39;re more sensitive

00:22:06.479 --> 00:22:10.319
Caption: of wavelengths closer to blue but when

00:22:08.798 --> 00:22:13.119
Caption: we&#39;re in brighter lights we&#39;re more

00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:15.359
Caption: sensitive to wavelengths of

00:22:13.119 --> 00:22:16.959
Caption: green and red because

00:22:15.359 --> 00:22:18.239
Caption: the cone cells

00:22:16.959 --> 00:22:19.520
Caption: they they can&#39;t deal with it when

00:22:18.239 --> 00:22:20.640
Caption: there&#39;s not much light and so if you

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.599
Caption: think about it at night time there&#39;s

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.440
Caption: even like a blue tint kind of or if if

00:22:23.599 --> 00:22:26.400
Caption: you pick up a blue object and an orange

00:22:25.439 --> 00:22:27.599
Caption: object

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.119
Caption: you won&#39;t be able to see the orange

00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:31.439
Caption: object as well as you could see the blue

00:22:29.119 --> 00:22:33.839
Caption: and that&#39;s why it&#39;s because we our cone

00:22:31.439 --> 00:22:36.000
Caption: cells are really terrible in low light

00:22:33.839 --> 00:22:39.119
Caption: and that&#39;s where our broad cells come in

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.359
Caption: so we see a blue tint at night instead

00:22:39.119 --> 00:22:42.479
Caption: and again that&#39;ll vary between um

00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:44.319
Caption: different people because we have a

00:22:42.479 --> 00:22:45.760
Caption: different number of conan rod cells and

00:22:44.319 --> 00:22:47.839
Caption: also i guess based on how many carrots

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.119
Caption: you&#39;ve eaten recently

00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:51.839
Caption: all right

00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:53.678
Caption: speaking of light or more specifically

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:55.599
Caption: seeing in the dark

00:22:53.678 --> 00:22:56.959
Caption: we&#39;ve played with paint and next i&#39;m

00:22:55.599 --> 00:22:59.038
Caption: really excited

00:22:56.959 --> 00:23:01.038
Caption: to have a play with

00:22:59.038 --> 00:23:04.558
Caption: mixing colors using light

00:23:01.038 --> 00:23:04.558
Caption: so we could turn the lights off

00:23:06.959 --> 00:23:12.558
Caption: all right so i have with me um some

00:23:09.678 --> 00:23:12.558
Caption: different torches

00:23:12.798 --> 00:23:16.798
Caption: yeah and i&#39;m gonna use them um to make

00:23:15.038 --> 00:23:18.558
Caption: different colors so

00:23:16.798 --> 00:23:20.000
Caption: i say different color torches like it&#39;s

00:23:18.558 --> 00:23:22.719
Caption: they&#39;re white torches with cellophane on

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.159
Caption: them um so i have with me i&#39;ve got a red

00:23:22.719 --> 00:23:25.918
Caption: and a blue so when i put them on the

00:23:24.159 --> 00:23:28.080
Caption: wall together so i&#39;ve got my red i&#39;ve

00:23:25.918 --> 00:23:29.678
Caption: got my blue but when i mix them together

00:23:28.079 --> 00:23:31.678
Caption: i get magenta

00:23:29.678 --> 00:23:32.640
Caption: just super pretty

00:23:31.678 --> 00:23:34.880
Caption: if i

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:38.239
Caption: mix if i take my red

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.319
Caption: and yellow sorry my red and green i

00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:41.278
Caption: should be able to get a yellow there we

00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:42.719
Caption: go

00:23:41.279 --> 00:23:44.000
Caption: kind of orange yellow there in the

00:23:42.719 --> 00:23:46.959
Caption: middle

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.359
Caption: uh and if i take uh my

00:23:46.959 --> 00:23:50.359
Caption: green and blue

00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:54.158
Caption: there we go then i should be able to get

00:23:52.719 --> 00:23:55.439
Caption: cyan

00:23:54.159 --> 00:23:58.320
Caption: very cool

00:23:55.439 --> 00:24:00.798
Caption: and then if i mix all of them um could i

00:23:58.319 --> 00:24:02.959
Caption: have a hand since you just walked in

00:24:00.798 --> 00:24:05.359
Caption: could you could you face this just hold

00:24:02.959 --> 00:24:07.439
Caption: it on the wall for me yeah

00:24:05.359 --> 00:24:09.119
Caption: okay if we add all of these we should be

00:24:07.439 --> 00:24:10.158
Caption: able to get a white in the middle there

00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:12.239
Caption: we go

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:13.919
Caption: very cool thank you

00:24:12.239 --> 00:24:17.038
Caption: great timing or bad timing to be near

00:24:13.918 --> 00:24:17.038
Caption: how you feel about being in a demo

00:24:17.439 --> 00:24:22.479
Caption: okay uh we can turn the lights back

00:24:20.479 --> 00:24:23.839
Caption: um

00:24:22.479 --> 00:24:25.439
Caption: okay

00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:27.439
Caption: it suddenly feels really bright in here

00:24:25.439 --> 00:24:28.639
Caption: just a trick to like wake you all up i&#39;m

00:24:27.439 --> 00:24:29.839
Caption: certainly awake

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.000
Caption: okay so

00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:34.479
Caption: what did we just do so basically i took

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.439
Caption: three primary colors um

00:24:34.479 --> 00:24:40.000
Caption: that&#39;s a lie this is the rgb model so

00:24:37.439 --> 00:24:42.158
Caption: red green blue again very creatively

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.678
Caption: named i took three colors mix them

00:24:42.159 --> 00:24:45.279
Caption: together on the wall to create new

00:24:43.678 --> 00:24:47.839
Caption: colors so to make some new secondary

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:49.440
Caption: colors

00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:51.760
Caption: um so what&#39;s actually happening when we

00:24:49.439 --> 00:24:53.839
Caption: did that is now that we know about eyes

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.558
Caption: we were actually stimulating different

00:24:53.839 --> 00:24:58.319
Caption: cones in our eyes so the light hits the

00:24:56.558 --> 00:25:00.558
Caption: wall it&#39;s reflected off the wall it goes

00:24:58.319 --> 00:25:01.918
Caption: to our eyes and we out because of the

00:25:00.558 --> 00:25:03.918
Caption: different cones that we have so whether

00:25:01.918 --> 00:25:06.239
Caption: we have red red green and blue cones we

00:25:03.918 --> 00:25:07.439
Caption: see different colors

00:25:06.239 --> 00:25:09.038
Caption: now

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:10.959
Caption: previously when we were playing with

00:25:09.038 --> 00:25:12.479
Caption: paint i mixed red yellow and blue and

00:25:10.959 --> 00:25:14.880
Caption: gold black well i mixed red yellow and

00:25:12.479 --> 00:25:15.918
Caption: blue i used some black paint and i got

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.959
Caption: black

00:25:15.918 --> 00:25:18.158
Caption: um

00:25:16.959 --> 00:25:20.640
Caption: but now when i&#39;m playing with these

00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:23.279
Caption: torches and i get and i mix red green

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:25.359
Caption: and blue i see white so with paint when

00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:26.960
Caption: i mixed my three primaries i got black

00:25:25.359 --> 00:25:29.278
Caption: but with my lights when i mixed my three

00:25:26.959 --> 00:25:32.959
Caption: primaries i got white

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:34.960
Caption: so our canvas started white and had uh

00:25:32.959 --> 00:25:36.319
Caption: color subtracted from it meanwhile when

00:25:34.959 --> 00:25:38.880
Caption: i play with my lights we&#39;d call this

00:25:36.319 --> 00:25:41.038
Caption: additive so my wall started we&#39;ll call

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.279
Caption: it black since we were in the dark

00:25:41.038 --> 00:25:45.199
Caption: and i added color to it so it goes in

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:47.039
Caption: the opposite way

00:25:45.199 --> 00:25:49.038
Caption: and a fun side note about that there&#39;s

00:25:47.038 --> 00:25:51.038
Caption: actually a pointless ongoing debate

00:25:49.038 --> 00:25:52.879
Caption: between experts as to whether or not

00:25:51.038 --> 00:25:54.839
Caption: white or black are technically colours

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.599
Caption: because they work in this opposite

00:25:54.839 --> 00:25:59.119
Caption: way i wonder if i made a slide to show

00:25:57.599 --> 00:26:01.439
Caption: you this

00:25:59.119 --> 00:26:03.599
Caption: maybe here we go all right

00:26:01.439 --> 00:26:03.599
Caption: so

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.239
Caption: uh when we&#39;re thinking about the light

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.400
Caption: uh all com sorry when we&#39;re thinking

00:26:08.239 --> 00:26:11.678
Caption: about light white is the combination of

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.839
Caption: all colors so they&#39;re being added

00:26:11.678 --> 00:26:15.678
Caption: together to make this color white so in

00:26:13.839 --> 00:26:17.439
Caption: that case we&#39;d consider yeah white&#39;s a

00:26:15.678 --> 00:26:19.519
Caption: color that makes sense

00:26:17.439 --> 00:26:21.359
Caption: meanwhile black is the absence of color

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.119
Caption: so i put some black paint on the canvas

00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:25.439
Caption: and we couldn&#39;t see any other color

00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:27.678
Caption: anymore so we&#39;d say no

00:26:25.439 --> 00:26:29.678
Caption: black is

00:26:27.678 --> 00:26:32.079
Caption: i feel like that&#39;s wrong

00:26:29.678 --> 00:26:33.678
Caption: black is not a color

00:26:32.079 --> 00:26:35.439
Caption: but if we&#39;re thinking of color as paint

00:26:33.678 --> 00:26:36.880
Caption: it&#39;s the uh

00:26:35.439 --> 00:26:38.479
Caption: sorry

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.479
Caption: past haley was right

00:26:38.479 --> 00:26:42.239
Caption: sleep deprived haley today was wrong

00:26:40.479 --> 00:26:43.918
Caption: this is correct so when we&#39;re playing

00:26:42.239 --> 00:26:46.798
Caption: with light on the wall and we don&#39;t have

00:26:43.918 --> 00:26:49.278
Caption: any torches on the wall uh we see black

00:26:46.798 --> 00:26:51.199
Caption: depending on how dark the room is um and

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:53.279
Caption: so we would not consider black of color

00:26:51.199 --> 00:26:54.880
Caption: now playing with paint it&#39;s the other

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:56.640
Caption: way around so

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.440
Caption: i cannot mix

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.119
Caption: uh paint together to generate white we

00:26:59.439 --> 00:27:02.879
Caption: cannot mix paint together to generate

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:05.199
Caption: white it&#39;s not something that we can do

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.599
Caption: so in this case we would consider white

00:27:05.199 --> 00:27:10.639
Caption: the absence of color and so we would say

00:27:07.599 --> 00:27:10.640
Caption: white is not a color

00:27:10.959 --> 00:27:14.319
Caption: but meanwhile

00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:16.159
Caption: we can combine different colors or

00:27:14.319 --> 00:27:18.719
Caption: different primaries of paints to get

00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:21.679
Caption: black so we&#39;d say yeah black&#39;s a color

00:27:18.719 --> 00:27:23.119
Caption: that makes sense but then just to make

00:27:21.678 --> 00:27:25.119
Caption: everything a little bit more difficult

00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:27.279
Caption: um if you talk to say someone into

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:29.199
Caption: pigment chemistry they&#39;ll say oh but

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:31.119
Caption: haley we could bleach the canvas to make

00:27:29.199 --> 00:27:32.000
Caption: it white so surely that makes it a color

00:27:31.119 --> 00:27:34.959
Caption: right

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Caption: and this is where the argument comes in

00:27:34.959 --> 00:27:38.880
Caption: i was like i&#39;ve been doing some deep

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.159
Caption: dives in the internet this week okay

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.359
Caption: all right all right coming back to

00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:42.720
Caption: computers because i promised that this

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:44.079
Caption: was going to be somewhat relevant to you

00:27:42.719 --> 00:27:44.880
Caption: today

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:46.239
Caption: so

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.760
Caption: i feel like hopefully we&#39;ve got a pretty

00:27:46.239 --> 00:27:49.278
Caption: good understanding of how colors work

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.440
Caption: and how we can mix colors so i&#39;ve did

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:53.200
Caption: that with pigments or paints here i did

00:27:51.439 --> 00:27:56.319
Caption: that with torches on the wall how does

00:27:53.199 --> 00:27:58.079
Caption: this connect to computers well

00:27:56.319 --> 00:28:00.158
Caption: we were playing with torches earlier and

00:27:58.079 --> 00:28:02.558
Caption: that is the connection between

00:28:00.159 --> 00:28:04.960
Caption: all of this and your computer screen

00:28:02.558 --> 00:28:07.439
Caption: so you can think of your computer screen

00:28:04.959 --> 00:28:10.558
Caption: as being this huge grid

00:28:07.439 --> 00:28:12.639
Caption: um and so each cell in this cruise

00:28:10.558 --> 00:28:14.239
Caption: is one tiny element of a picture that we

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.479
Caption: might see and again i&#39;m not an artist

00:28:14.239 --> 00:28:18.640
Caption: but i made us a little picture so

00:28:16.479 --> 00:28:20.640
Caption: imagine this is a grid on your computer

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.159
Caption: it&#39;s filled with all these tiny cells

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.640
Caption: and then each of these cells we would

00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:26.640
Caption: call a picture element otherwise known

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.000
Caption: as a pixel

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.520
Caption: and then if we look at one of these

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.520
Caption: pixels

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.359
Caption: really close

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.520
Caption: really close we can see that it&#39;s made

00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:37.119
Caption: of three lights so it&#39;s got a red light

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.839
Caption: it&#39;s got a green light and it&#39;s got a

00:28:37.119 --> 00:28:42.079
Caption: blue light and in this case my picture

00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:45.359
Caption: was blue or that cell was blue so only

00:28:42.079 --> 00:28:47.918
Caption: the blue light is turned on

00:28:45.359 --> 00:28:50.000
Caption: so computer screens actually use the rgb

00:28:47.918 --> 00:28:51.199
Caption: color model just like i was using when i

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.199
Caption: was playing with these torches on the

00:28:51.199 --> 00:28:54.479
Caption: wall

00:28:53.199 --> 00:28:56.479
Caption: so

00:28:54.479 --> 00:28:59.119
Caption: when i zoomed in on one of these pixels

00:28:56.479 --> 00:29:00.558
Caption: i can see my rgmb so i can see the three

00:28:59.119 --> 00:29:02.399
Caption: other three lights acting there in this

00:29:00.558 --> 00:29:05.359
Caption: case again blue&#39;s turned on because i&#39;m

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:07.600
Caption: showing a blue pixel

00:29:05.359 --> 00:29:10.558
Caption: so with that in mind

00:29:07.599 --> 00:29:12.479
Caption: imagine this circle represents all the

00:29:10.558 --> 00:29:14.398
Caption: visible colors of light so these are all

00:29:12.479 --> 00:29:16.319
Caption: the colors that we could possibly see as

00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:17.760
Caption: humans

00:29:16.319 --> 00:29:20.239
Caption: rgb

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.760
Caption: represents a very specific subset of

00:29:20.239 --> 00:29:25.119
Caption: that

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.520
Caption: um so rgb being

00:29:25.119 --> 00:29:29.359
Caption: this one here this big yellow one so we

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.959
Caption: can&#39;t actually generate every single

00:29:29.359 --> 00:29:33.119
Caption: color uh

00:29:30.959 --> 00:29:35.599
Caption: using rgb but we can generate a lot like

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:38.079
Caption: it&#39;s enough

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:40.239
Caption: uh rgb is actually so we&#39;d call it a

00:29:38.079 --> 00:29:42.319
Caption: color model as we touched on earlier and

00:29:40.239 --> 00:29:44.880
Caption: then inside these color models we can

00:29:42.319 --> 00:29:47.038
Caption: make color spaces so this is an example

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.640
Caption: of a color space it&#39;s called srgb

00:29:47.038 --> 00:29:50.558
Caption: honestly these names like they are not

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:53.039
Caption: creative at all and that stands for

00:29:50.558 --> 00:29:54.558
Caption: standard rgb

00:29:53.038 --> 00:29:56.719
Caption: standard rgb

00:29:54.558 --> 00:29:58.558
Caption: uh was created by hp and microsoft i

00:29:56.719 --> 00:30:01.839
Caption: told you would come back to tech

00:29:58.558 --> 00:30:04.479
Caption: in 1996 for use on monitors so this is

00:30:01.839 --> 00:30:06.880
Caption: the very widely used standard for what

00:30:04.479 --> 00:30:10.079
Caption: colors will display on monitors

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.079
Caption: so these days esrgb very very widely

00:30:10.079 --> 00:30:14.319
Caption: used even though it was created a very

00:30:12.079 --> 00:30:16.000
Caption: long time ago unless you have a modern

00:30:14.319 --> 00:30:20.158
Caption: apple device in which case you&#39;ll be

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.159
Caption: seeing display p3 because apple

00:30:20.239 --> 00:30:25.678
Caption: so because of that we would say rgb is a

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.919
Caption: device dependent model because

00:30:25.678 --> 00:30:30.719
Caption: manufacturers use slightly different

00:30:27.918 --> 00:30:32.558
Caption: color spaces based off rgb and also

00:30:30.719 --> 00:30:34.558
Caption: there&#39;ll be slight variations

00:30:32.558 --> 00:30:35.760
Caption: in the materials used by the actual

00:30:34.558 --> 00:30:36.798
Caption: manufacturers when they build the

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.359
Caption: screens

00:30:36.798 --> 00:30:41.119
Caption: so that means that the gamut of colors

00:30:39.359 --> 00:30:43.439
Caption: that can be produced on a screen will

00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:45.279
Caption: vary ever so slightly between different

00:30:43.439 --> 00:30:46.319
Caption: screens so that&#39;s why if you look at

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:47.520
Caption: your phone you compare it to your

00:30:46.319 --> 00:30:48.719
Caption: friend&#39;s phone and you think hang on

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.558
Caption: this is the same picture how come it

00:30:48.719 --> 00:30:51.760
Caption: looks different on yours that&#39;s why it&#39;s

00:30:50.558 --> 00:30:53.119
Caption: because they might be using a different

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.000
Caption: gamut or they might just be made of

00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:58.558
Caption: different materials or both

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.119
Caption: now it&#39;s not a coincidence that rgb is

00:30:58.558 --> 00:31:02.798
Caption: the preferred color model for computers

00:31:01.119 --> 00:31:05.038
Caption: it&#39;s because it&#39;s the way our cones

00:31:02.798 --> 00:31:06.558
Caption: perceive color so it is absolutely not a

00:31:05.038 --> 00:31:08.319
Caption: coincidence that we were chatting about

00:31:06.558 --> 00:31:09.760
Caption: cones and whatnot earlier um and it&#39;s

00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:11.278
Caption: not a coincidence that that&#39;s the colors

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.760
Caption: that computers choose to use it&#39;s

00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:15.519
Caption: because it matches human biology we

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.119
Caption: build these things for us remember and

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:19.760
Caption: so they&#39;re going to use what matches our

00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:20.880
Caption: biology

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.039
Caption: so

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.319
Caption: rgb this is really the theme of i feel

00:31:23.038 --> 00:31:25.759
Caption: like i need to rename this talk which is

00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:28.398
Caption: rgb what is it

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:31.119
Caption: so i have mentioned um read green and

00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:32.799
Caption: blue like a lot and i&#39;m hoping for the

00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:34.558
Caption: developers and the designers in the room

00:31:32.798 --> 00:31:36.639
Caption: that combination of colors is sounding

00:31:34.558 --> 00:31:38.798
Caption: really really familiar but in case it&#39;s

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.599
Caption: not or web development is not your usual

00:31:38.798 --> 00:31:42.158
Caption: thing

00:31:39.599 --> 00:31:44.558
Caption: let me jog your memory

00:31:42.159 --> 00:31:46.399
Caption: so i have made the world&#39;s most boring

00:31:44.558 --> 00:31:47.678
Caption: web page

00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:49.519
Caption: there is nothing on it other than a

00:31:47.678 --> 00:31:51.199
Caption: color and i oh that&#39;s what i&#39;m talking

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:52.320
Caption: about it&#39;s blue here it kind of looks

00:31:51.199 --> 00:31:53.760
Caption: purple to me there this is what i&#39;m

00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:54.639
Caption: saying people

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.599
Caption: so

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.119
Caption: uh

00:31:55.599 --> 00:31:58.479
Caption: this webpage has nothing on it but a

00:31:57.119 --> 00:32:00.158
Caption: background color and i defined that

00:31:58.479 --> 00:32:03.599
Caption: using css and i can show that to you as

00:32:00.159 --> 00:32:04.799
Caption: well if i can find my cursor here

00:32:03.599 --> 00:32:08.079
Caption: oh

00:32:04.798 --> 00:32:08.959
Caption: that&#39;s not what i meant to do or not

00:32:08.079 --> 00:32:11.518
Caption: all right

00:32:08.959 --> 00:32:13.359
Caption: and yes i can make that bigger

00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:15.200
Caption: all right so very simple css all i&#39;ve

00:32:13.359 --> 00:32:18.880
Caption: done is defined the background color and

00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:18.880
Caption: i&#39;ve done that using the rgb function

00:32:19.038 --> 00:32:22.398
Caption: so what i&#39;m actually doing when i&#39;m

00:32:20.479 --> 00:32:24.319
Caption: using that rgb function is i&#39;m changing

00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:26.320
Caption: the intensity of each of

00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:28.158
Caption: red green and blue

00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:30.319
Caption: and when i say changing the intensity

00:32:28.159 --> 00:32:31.840
Caption: what i mean is every pixel that&#39;s been

00:32:30.319 --> 00:32:33.599
Caption: used to display that web page on the

00:32:31.839 --> 00:32:35.119
Caption: screen it&#39;s going to look at this and

00:32:33.599 --> 00:32:36.479
Caption: say okay how much red do you want how

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:38.640
Caption: much green do you want and how much blue

00:32:36.479 --> 00:32:40.798
Caption: do you want

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.799
Caption: so the intensity is being defined by

00:32:40.798 --> 00:32:44.719
Caption: those values so in this case i&#39;ve gone

00:32:42.798 --> 00:32:47.599
Caption: zero zero two five five which is why

00:32:44.719 --> 00:32:48.719
Caption: that web script the web page appears

00:32:47.599 --> 00:32:51.678
Caption: blue

00:32:48.719 --> 00:32:54.719
Caption: or purple on the screen

00:32:51.678 --> 00:32:56.398
Caption: uh and if i wanted uh to say if i wanted

00:32:54.719 --> 00:32:59.359
Caption: to make red then i could change those

00:32:56.399 --> 00:33:01.360
Caption: values so i could go two five five zero

00:32:59.359 --> 00:33:03.439
Caption: zero so i want maximum red i don&#39;t want

00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:04.880
Caption: any green and i don&#39;t want any blue and

00:33:03.439 --> 00:33:08.158
Caption: let&#39;s see what the screen thing says oh

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.159
Caption: that&#39;s pretty red that&#39;s pretty good

00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:14.000
Caption: if i wanted to get a color uh that isn&#39;t

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.038
Caption: one of my primaries um then i could use

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.959
Caption: a combination instead so in this case if

00:33:17.038 --> 00:33:20.879
Caption: i wanted to get i think this is purple

00:33:18.959 --> 00:33:22.239
Caption: i&#39;ve got one two eight zero one two

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.760
Caption: eight so i&#39;m saying hey i want a little

00:33:22.239 --> 00:33:25.678
Caption: bit of red i want a little bit of blue

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.399
Caption: but i don&#39;t want any green

00:33:25.678 --> 00:33:30.000
Caption: now given that blue was purple

00:33:28.399 --> 00:33:31.440
Caption: oh it&#39;s pretty purple

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.399
Caption: oh it kind of looks like someone to my

00:33:31.439 --> 00:33:33.759
Caption: hair

00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:35.039
Caption: up there anyway

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.119
Caption: okay

00:33:35.038 --> 00:33:39.278
Caption: so basically what i did just then is i

00:33:37.119 --> 00:33:40.959
Caption: said hey i want to use red and blue

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:42.559
Caption: lights but i want each of them at half

00:33:40.959 --> 00:33:44.959
Caption: the intensity and so that&#39;s how i

00:33:42.558 --> 00:33:46.239
Caption: generated my purple so similar to when i

00:33:44.959 --> 00:33:47.678
Caption: was playing with these torches except

00:33:46.239 --> 00:33:49.359
Caption: they&#39;re not cool enough for me to match

00:33:47.678 --> 00:33:51.359
Caption: to pick specific intensities but that&#39;s

00:33:49.359 --> 00:33:53.199
Caption: what i&#39;m doing when i define my rgb in

00:33:51.359 --> 00:33:56.000
Caption: my css that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing when you

00:33:53.199 --> 00:33:56.719
Caption: use rgb in your css

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.239
Caption: so

00:33:56.719 --> 00:34:00.319
Caption: um because i told you that i&#39;m a bit of

00:33:58.239 --> 00:34:01.678
Caption: a nerd i would like to focus on these

00:34:00.319 --> 00:34:03.759
Caption: numbers so

00:34:01.678 --> 00:34:04.839
Caption: have you ever wondered why they go from

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.279
Caption: 0 to

00:34:04.839 --> 00:34:08.878
Caption: 255 because i don&#39;t know about you when

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:10.320
Caption: i first stumbled across that i&#39;m like

00:34:08.878 --> 00:34:12.078
Caption: that&#39;s a really random number where did

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:15.678
Caption: that come from it turns out it&#39;s not

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:17.119
Caption: random it has a lot of meaning behind it

00:34:15.678 --> 00:34:19.439
Caption: and we&#39;re going to go back to primary

00:34:17.118 --> 00:34:20.479
Caption: school days now so we&#39;re really going

00:34:19.439 --> 00:34:21.918
Caption: all over the show we&#39;re going to hop

00:34:20.479 --> 00:34:23.199
Caption: back to primary

00:34:21.918 --> 00:34:25.199
Caption: um and we&#39;re going to learn about the

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:26.878
Caption: decimal number system

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:29.918
Caption: so decimal numbers being the numbers

00:34:26.878 --> 00:34:31.598
Caption: that we us humans use um every day

00:34:29.918 --> 00:34:34.158
Caption: um and more specifically i mean the

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:36.960
Caption: digits 0 to 9. so these are what make up

00:34:34.158 --> 00:34:39.040
Caption: our decimal number system

00:34:36.959 --> 00:34:41.439
Caption: so since we have 10 digits to work with

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.359
Caption: in our decimal system the largest number

00:34:41.439 --> 00:34:45.358
Caption: that we can represent using a single

00:34:43.358 --> 00:34:46.559
Caption: digit is 9.

00:34:45.358 --> 00:34:48.559
Caption: and then if we want to represent a

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.879
Caption: bigger number than that we have to add

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.800
Caption: another digit to get 10.

00:34:50.878 --> 00:34:54.878
Caption: and then once we get to 99 if i want to

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.239
Caption: represent a bigger number i have to add

00:34:54.878 --> 00:34:57.760
Caption: another digit

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.118
Caption: and i add 1 which lets me get to a

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.479
Caption: thousand

00:34:59.118 --> 00:35:01.519
Caption: a hundred

00:35:00.479 --> 00:35:04.399
Caption: maths

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.760
Caption: and if i wanted to get um to a thousand

00:35:04.399 --> 00:35:07.598
Caption: then i&#39;ve got to add another digit so

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.679
Caption: now i&#39;ve got four digits which leave me

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:11.280
Caption: lets me represent a thousand

00:35:09.679 --> 00:35:13.520
Caption: the pattern that&#39;s happening here is the

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.520
Caption: digit on the left is worth 10 times as

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.280
Caption: much as the digit on the right so we&#39;ve

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:19.679
Caption: got ten numbers to work with zero

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:22.320
Caption: through nine and each of these worth ten

00:35:19.679 --> 00:35:24.159
Caption: times as much as the digit on the right

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.520
Caption: so

00:35:24.159 --> 00:35:26.639
Caption: that&#39;s what side i was expecting to

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.640
Caption: there all right

00:35:26.639 --> 00:35:33.118
Caption: so if we take the number 123 for example

00:35:30.639 --> 00:35:35.118
Caption: the 1 is worth 10 times as much as the 2

00:35:33.118 --> 00:35:36.719
Caption: and the 2 is worth 10 times as much as

00:35:35.118 --> 00:35:37.679
Caption: the 3.

00:35:36.719 --> 00:35:39.439
Caption: now

00:35:37.679 --> 00:35:42.078
Caption: computers remember how i said they&#39;re

00:35:39.439 --> 00:35:43.919
Caption: super dumb so they can&#39;t handle 0 to 9

00:35:42.079 --> 00:35:45.680
Caption: for a variety of reasons so instead they

00:35:43.919 --> 00:35:48.319
Caption: use a binary system

00:35:45.679 --> 00:35:49.760
Caption: or just zero and one so they forget two

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.800
Caption: through nine they&#39;ve just got zero and

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.599
Caption: one that&#39;s all they&#39;ve got to work with

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.280
Caption: so

00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:57.680
Caption: since there are only two options that&#39;s

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.679
Caption: why we call them binary digits

00:35:57.679 --> 00:36:01.199
Caption: and because we&#39;re super lazy we shorten

00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:04.000
Caption: that and this is where the term bit

00:36:01.199 --> 00:36:07.199
Caption: comes from so a bit is a binary digit

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.199
Caption: which means zero or one

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.199
Caption: so since there are only two digits to

00:36:09.199 --> 00:36:12.399
Caption: work with this means that representing

00:36:11.199 --> 00:36:14.000
Caption: numbers in binary

00:36:12.399 --> 00:36:16.719
Caption: is not the same as how we would in

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Caption: decimal it&#39;s a little bit trickier so

00:36:16.719 --> 00:36:20.800
Caption: rather than

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.800
Caption: each digit being worth 10 times as much

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.800
Caption: it&#39;s digit on the right in binary it&#39;s

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.199
Caption: worth only two times as much

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.479
Caption: so for example in this number one zero

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:32.159
Caption: zero one

00:36:28.479 --> 00:36:34.399
Caption: uh our number on the right is worth one

00:36:32.159 --> 00:36:36.479
Caption: zero is worth two

00:36:34.399 --> 00:36:38.479
Caption: the next zero is worth four and the next

00:36:36.479 --> 00:36:40.560
Caption: one is worth eight so it doubles each

00:36:38.479 --> 00:36:44.239
Caption: time so previously we went up in tens

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.239
Caption: this time we&#39;re doubling it

00:36:44.399 --> 00:36:47.598
Caption: and if you&#39;re wondering uh we can

00:36:46.239 --> 00:36:50.320
Caption: definitely work out what this number is

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:52.400
Caption: in binary so the first one is worth one

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:55.040
Caption: so keep one in your mind the next one

00:36:52.399 --> 00:36:57.279
Caption: we&#39;d say it&#39;s turned off or zero doesn&#39;t

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.119
Caption: mean anything so we ignore it we ignore

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.919
Caption: the next one and then this is worth

00:36:59.118 --> 00:37:05.039
Caption: eight eight plus one is nine so this

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:05.919
Caption: number is nine so one zero zero one is

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.520
Caption: nine

00:37:05.919 --> 00:37:08.959
Caption: in binary

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.800
Caption: all right i&#39;ve got some challenges for

00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:13.040
Caption: you so i&#39;m so excited another person

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.479
Caption: walked in this room all right

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.959
Caption: what does this number represent in

00:37:14.479 --> 00:37:19.118
Caption: binary so we have one turned on we don&#39;t

00:37:16.959 --> 00:37:22.479
Caption: have a two we&#39;ve got a four we&#39;ve got an

00:37:19.118 --> 00:37:24.559
Caption: eight what is this number

00:37:22.479 --> 00:37:25.439
Caption: nailed it all right cool what about this

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.119
Caption: one

00:37:25.439 --> 00:37:30.319
Caption: four five six seven yes nailed it

00:37:29.118 --> 00:37:31.598
Caption: i thought that was a nine on my screen

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.560
Caption: like oh no

00:37:31.599 --> 00:37:34.839
Caption: okay

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:37.920
Caption: okay what about this

00:37:34.839 --> 00:37:40.480
Caption: one seven plus eight is um

00:37:37.919 --> 00:37:43.118
Caption: 15 15. perfect this one oh wait here one

00:37:40.479 --> 00:37:43.118
Caption: count this one

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:49.439
Caption: i was really hoping for the space in the

00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:51.039
Caption: audience that i got it okay sorry would

00:37:49.439 --> 00:37:52.239
Caption: that if you&#39;re wondering that number was

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.079
Caption: eight thousand one hundred and ninety

00:37:52.239 --> 00:37:56.639
Caption: one um i didn&#39;t work that out i put it

00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:57.520
Caption: through a converter all right

00:37:56.639 --> 00:37:59.919
Caption: yes

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:02.399
Caption: okay all right i wanna focus on this one

00:37:59.919 --> 00:38:04.639
Caption: in particular though so one one one one

00:38:02.399 --> 00:38:07.039
Caption: is fifteen

00:38:04.639 --> 00:38:10.799
Caption: so we get to 15 by having four bits we&#39;d

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:12.479
Caption: say turned on or we&#39;re using four bits

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.719
Caption: and what&#39;s interesting about that is if

00:38:12.479 --> 00:38:16.479
Caption: i wanted to get sata 16 i would have to

00:38:14.719 --> 00:38:17.598
Caption: add another bit so at the moment the

00:38:16.479 --> 00:38:18.879
Caption: most

00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:21.839
Caption: or the highest number that i could

00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:23.919
Caption: represent using 4 bits is 15. if i

00:38:21.839 --> 00:38:24.880
Caption: wanted 16 i have to add another bit to

00:38:23.919 --> 00:38:26.799
Caption: it

00:38:24.879 --> 00:38:28.159
Caption: now a throwback to

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.560
Caption: our rgb

00:38:28.159 --> 00:38:32.959
Caption: so the highest number that we can use

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.079
Caption: when we are defining colors in our css

00:38:32.959 --> 00:38:38.800
Caption: the highest number that we can use is

00:38:34.079 --> 00:38:41.920
Caption: 255. this is not a coincidence so 255 in

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:44.160
Caption: binary is eight bits turned on

00:38:41.919 --> 00:38:46.399
Caption: so when we&#39;re working with computers

00:38:44.159 --> 00:38:48.239
Caption: computers really like eights eight bits

00:38:46.399 --> 00:38:50.319
Caption: is called a byte so we&#39;re happy with

00:38:48.239 --> 00:38:54.239
Caption: this number it&#39;s good for us so we use

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:56.239
Caption: zero to 255 because that&#39;s eight bits

00:38:54.239 --> 00:38:58.079
Caption: now we actually have three components

00:38:56.239 --> 00:39:00.879
Caption: though so we&#39;ve got red green and blue

00:38:58.079 --> 00:39:03.119
Caption: each of them have uh eight bits or one

00:39:00.879 --> 00:39:05.118
Caption: byte so eight plus eight plus eight

00:39:03.118 --> 00:39:07.439
Caption: that&#39;s 24 and so this is where the term

00:39:05.118 --> 00:39:09.118
Caption: 24 bit color comes from if you&#39;ve ever

00:39:07.439 --> 00:39:11.040
Caption: heard of that before

00:39:09.118 --> 00:39:12.399
Caption: now since each bit has two states so in

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.959
Caption: this case they&#39;re all turned on which is

00:39:12.399 --> 00:39:17.118
Caption: why it&#39;s worth 255 but each bit has two

00:39:14.959 --> 00:39:18.399
Caption: states so it could be zero or one so if

00:39:17.118 --> 00:39:21.279
Caption: we have two

00:39:18.399 --> 00:39:24.399
Caption: uh to the power of 24 bits that actually

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:27.359
Caption: results in many many colors

00:39:24.399 --> 00:39:29.679
Caption: in fact this many colors so about 16.7

00:39:27.358 --> 00:39:32.319
Caption: million colors can be represented uh

00:39:29.679 --> 00:39:34.879
Caption: using 24-bit color humans can only see

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.640
Caption: about 10 million colors uh so this is

00:39:34.879 --> 00:39:38.159
Caption: more than enough um so this is the

00:39:36.639 --> 00:39:39.358
Caption: answer to the question of why why

00:39:38.159 --> 00:39:41.358
Caption: wouldn&#39;t you add more bits because it

00:39:39.358 --> 00:39:43.598
Caption: would be pointless we as humans we can&#39;t

00:39:41.358 --> 00:39:44.799
Caption: see it

00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:46.000
Caption: okay

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:49.199
Caption: but

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.079
Caption: this is not where we started so today we

00:39:49.199 --> 00:39:55.040
Caption: have access to 16.7 million colors

00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:58.079
Caption: but css started a lot more simple with

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:59.760
Caption: 16 colors and this was them very special

00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:04.479
Caption: completely arbitrary

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:07.118
Caption: so in 1995 16 basic colors were defined

00:40:04.479 --> 00:40:09.919
Caption: in the html 3.0 spec and they were

00:40:07.118 --> 00:40:11.919
Caption: labeled as being in the srgb color space

00:40:09.919 --> 00:40:13.919
Caption: which is what monitors today use again

00:40:11.919 --> 00:40:15.919
Caption: unless you&#39;re apple and we&#39;re considered

00:40:13.919 --> 00:40:18.639
Caption: the standard 16 colors to be supported

00:40:15.919 --> 00:40:20.879
Caption: by windows vga palette so at the time

00:40:18.639 --> 00:40:22.719
Caption: that was the most widely used standard

00:40:20.879 --> 00:40:25.118
Caption: for screens

00:40:22.719 --> 00:40:28.560
Caption: so we had these 16 standard colors and

00:40:25.118 --> 00:40:31.279
Caption: then we had 124 extended colors

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.719
Caption: and the idea was that these 16 standard

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.239
Caption: colors you could use them anywhere they

00:40:32.719 --> 00:40:36.838
Caption: always had to work they always had to

00:40:34.239 --> 00:40:39.520
Caption: look the same um and in the other

00:40:36.839 --> 00:40:41.839
Caption: 124 probably be okay

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.560
Caption: and it was mostly okay um unless you

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:48.400
Caption: used opera 3.5 on windows 98 in which

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.400
Caption: case 14 colors were randomly missing

00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:54.078
Caption: i didn&#39;t think it was that funny you

00:40:52.319 --> 00:40:55.119
Caption: guys really threw me there okay

00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:59.760
Caption: um

00:40:55.118 --> 00:41:02.000
Caption: all right fortunately um by 2005 um all

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:04.560
Caption: modern browsers supported the full list

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.399
Caption: so happy days um we weren&#39;t limited by

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:10.319
Caption: um 16 we could have the full 140 of them

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:14.078
Caption: um also interestingly when i was looking

00:41:10.319 --> 00:41:17.839
Caption: this up in the spec in css 2.1 orange

00:41:14.079 --> 00:41:21.599
Caption: got promoted to the top 16 so we had 17

00:41:17.839 --> 00:41:24.880
Caption: basic colors and 139 extended colors and

00:41:21.599 --> 00:41:26.160
Caption: then in css 3 it got cut again so i

00:41:24.879 --> 00:41:28.159
Caption: don&#39;t know what that&#39;s about it was

00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:29.760
Caption: there and then it was demoted i don&#39;t

00:41:28.159 --> 00:41:31.838
Caption: know why i just i just thought that was

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.760
Caption: amusing

00:41:31.839 --> 00:41:36.239
Caption: but meanwhile now in the working draft

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.599
Caption: for the css level four color module

00:41:36.239 --> 00:41:39.358
Caption: they&#39;ve just combined both lists so we

00:41:37.599 --> 00:41:42.000
Caption: just now have just one standard list

00:41:39.358 --> 00:41:43.039
Caption: rather than these two separates

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.800
Caption: but

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.079
Caption: where did these names come from and what

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.079
Caption: do they mean

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:50.160
Caption: well this was a journey learning about

00:41:48.079 --> 00:41:51.040
Caption: this let me tell you

00:41:50.159 --> 00:41:53.598
Caption: so

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.919
Caption: uh in 1984

00:41:53.599 --> 00:41:57.280
Caption: um a windows system came out called x

00:41:55.919 --> 00:41:59.040
Caption: windows system

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.159
Caption: and with that windowing system so when i

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.439
Caption: say window like imagine you&#39;ve got a

00:42:00.159 --> 00:42:02.959
Caption: bunch of windows on your screen that you

00:42:01.439 --> 00:42:05.118
Caption: can move around like this is that that

00:42:02.959 --> 00:42:07.358
Caption: was the software&#39;s whole job and so with

00:42:05.118 --> 00:42:10.078
Caption: this software it came with a list a file

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:12.000
Caption: called rgb.txt

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:15.119
Caption: and so inside this text file was a bunch

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Caption: of colors and by 1987 this was pretty

00:42:15.118 --> 00:42:21.039
Caption: popular software it was really well used

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.560
Caption: and the rgb.txt was now a list of 69

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.319
Caption: colors

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.839
Caption: and so that list eventually became a

00:42:24.319 --> 00:42:28.000
Caption: commonly used list of colors because

00:42:25.839 --> 00:42:29.119
Caption: people would build stuff to be used by

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.560
Caption: the software so they thought hey i&#39;ll

00:42:29.118 --> 00:42:31.760
Caption: just use the same color and then

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.439
Caption: designers would be like hey this is

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.639
Caption: getting this is like this seems to be

00:42:33.439 --> 00:42:36.560
Caption: really popular a lot of people are using

00:42:34.639 --> 00:42:38.078
Caption: these i&#39;ll just use these colors too but

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.280
Caption: there was no real

00:42:38.079 --> 00:42:41.040
Caption: standard

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.319
Caption: it was just kind of what people felt

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.439
Caption: like doing and maybe they didn&#39;t feel

00:42:42.319 --> 00:42:44.800
Caption: like using that one so they wouldn&#39;t

00:42:43.439 --> 00:42:47.439
Caption: include it in their list and it was just

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.920
Caption: all a bit of a mess which is what led me

00:42:47.439 --> 00:42:51.439
Caption: to find this extract from the css spec

00:42:49.919 --> 00:42:53.118
Caption: and you don&#39;t read all of it let me let

00:42:51.439 --> 00:42:53.838
Caption: me show you my favorite parts

00:42:53.118 --> 00:42:55.760
Caption: so

00:42:53.839 --> 00:42:57.440
Caption: these color names are standardized here

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.199
Caption: not because they&#39;re good but because

00:42:57.439 --> 00:43:00.959
Caption: their use and implementation has been

00:42:59.199 --> 00:43:03.358
Caption: widespread

00:43:00.959 --> 00:43:05.679
Caption: um my other favorite part the names are

00:43:03.358 --> 00:43:07.759
Caption: not even internally consistent dark gray

00:43:05.679 --> 00:43:10.000
Caption: is lighter than gray while light pink is

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.520
Caption: darker than pink so basically this thing

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.839
Caption: was a mess

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.839
Caption: um

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:18.959
Caption: sorry this is not you it&#39;s me

00:43:17.919 --> 00:43:19.838
Caption: you&#39;re good

00:43:18.959 --> 00:43:21.439
Caption: um

00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:23.040
Caption: so basically this list was all over the

00:43:21.439 --> 00:43:24.399
Caption: show it was a mess different colors

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.479
Caption: meant different things

00:43:24.399 --> 00:43:27.760
Caption: based on which computer you were on that

00:43:26.479 --> 00:43:29.598
Caption: these names were not thought through

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.399
Caption: they were never intended to become as

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:34.319
Caption: widely uh used as they were software was

00:43:32.399 --> 00:43:36.318
Caption: built that used it designers got used to

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:37.680
Caption: it it just got out of hand

00:43:36.319 --> 00:43:40.079
Caption: but

00:43:37.679 --> 00:43:42.000
Caption: eventually we decided we needed a list

00:43:40.079 --> 00:43:45.200
Caption: we needed some standard colors and we

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.479
Caption: made some headway so in the 1990s most

00:43:45.199 --> 00:43:49.598
Caption: displays were capable of displaying

00:43:47.479 --> 00:43:50.639
Caption: 256 colors

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:52.960
Caption: wild

00:43:50.639 --> 00:43:55.598
Caption: so operating systems

00:43:52.959 --> 00:43:58.399
Caption: would often reserve between 16 and 20

00:43:55.599 --> 00:44:00.960
Caption: colors for their own use so that

00:43:58.399 --> 00:44:02.879
Caption: limited us a little bit and it meant

00:44:00.959 --> 00:44:04.719
Caption: that uh

00:44:02.879 --> 00:44:06.559
Caption: so admit that we lit

00:44:04.719 --> 00:44:08.479
Caption: this problem was wild so

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.560
Caption: we had 256 colors we could see on a

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:12.079
Caption: screen which might vary between monitors

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.160
Caption: but then some operating systems would

00:44:12.079 --> 00:44:15.359
Caption: pick between 16 and 20 colors that they

00:44:14.159 --> 00:44:16.959
Caption: would just claim as their own and make

00:44:15.358 --> 00:44:18.639
Caption: them look different and so what would

00:44:16.959 --> 00:44:20.318
Caption: happen is if you opened up an image on a

00:44:18.639 --> 00:44:21.919
Caption: computer that didn&#39;t have a reference

00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:24.160
Caption: for that color the computer would be

00:44:21.919 --> 00:44:26.000
Caption: like no worries i&#39;ll just add some noise

00:44:24.159 --> 00:44:26.719
Caption: and cover up that hole and so it would

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Caption: just

00:44:26.719 --> 00:44:29.919
Caption: it would just throw some noise at the

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.439
Caption: picture in this method called differing

00:44:29.919 --> 00:44:32.639
Caption: just to like just ignore the problem and

00:44:31.439 --> 00:44:34.239
Caption: hope you wouldn&#39;t notice that was

00:44:32.639 --> 00:44:36.159
Caption: literally what they did

00:44:34.239 --> 00:44:38.079
Caption: so basically there was no consistency

00:44:36.159 --> 00:44:40.318
Caption: between monitors operating systems or

00:44:38.079 --> 00:44:42.640
Caption: browsers colors were a mess

00:44:40.319 --> 00:44:46.000
Caption: and this is where web safe colors came

00:44:42.639 --> 00:44:47.838
Caption: in this was a standardized list of 216

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.079
Caption: colors that we could use on the web

00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:53.119
Caption: guaranteed to work

00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:55.040
Caption: computers monitors software browsers all

00:44:53.118 --> 00:44:56.479
Caption: of it they all had to use these web safe

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.839
Caption: colors

00:44:56.479 --> 00:45:02.560
Caption: but just after we got that list

00:44:59.839 --> 00:45:04.720
Caption: we introduced true color or 24 bit color

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.079
Caption: and we didn&#39;t need it anymore so just as

00:45:04.719 --> 00:45:08.239
Caption: we got this list of standard colors

00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:10.239
Caption: after like a 20 year wait already gone

00:45:08.239 --> 00:45:11.760
Caption: doesn&#39;t matter we now have 16.7 million

00:45:10.239 --> 00:45:13.439
Caption: colors who cares don&#39;t need web safe

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.399
Caption: anymore so it was a long journey an

00:45:13.439 --> 00:45:18.800
Caption: absolutely pointless one

00:45:16.399 --> 00:45:20.318
Caption: never mind

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:23.359
Caption: all right

00:45:20.319 --> 00:45:25.760
Caption: so coming back to css i would love for

00:45:23.358 --> 00:45:27.439
Caption: us to chat about hex codes because this

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.719
Caption: is actually what inspired this whole

00:45:27.439 --> 00:45:31.760
Caption: talk

00:45:28.719 --> 00:45:33.439
Caption: so if you haven&#39;t seen a hex code before

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:35.199
Caption: this is another way to define color that

00:45:33.439 --> 00:45:36.639
Caption: we use in css and i&#39;m sure designers

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:38.239
Caption: will see this as well

00:45:36.639 --> 00:45:39.279
Caption: so here are four different colors here

00:45:38.239 --> 00:45:41.199
Caption: are four different hex codes to

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.520
Caption: represent each of those colors

00:45:41.199 --> 00:45:45.520
Caption: and they work really similar to the way

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.719
Caption: rgb does as well

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.319
Caption: so

00:45:46.719 --> 00:45:50.239
Caption: let&#39;s have a closer

00:45:48.319 --> 00:45:51.760
Caption: look oh and just a side note those

00:45:50.239 --> 00:45:54.159
Caption: colors that we were just chatting about

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.399
Caption: um and these hex codes they all map to

00:45:54.159 --> 00:45:58.879
Caption: rgb anyway so this is just like picking

00:45:56.399 --> 00:46:01.358
Caption: a different way to define the same color

00:45:58.879 --> 00:46:02.879
Caption: but obviously there&#39;s not a list of 16.7

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:04.799
Caption: million colors so at some point you&#39;ve

00:46:02.879 --> 00:46:06.559
Caption: got to commit to rgb or hex um because

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.599
Caption: that list is not gonna that&#39;s not gonna

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.719
Caption: work

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:09.520
Caption: okay

00:46:08.719 --> 00:46:11.040
Caption: so

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.599
Caption: um let&#39;s unpack these so i&#39;m gonna look

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.439
Caption: at that purple one so 5f3a8e

00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:16.319
Caption: what the heck is happening there

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:18.000
Caption: so

00:46:16.319 --> 00:46:19.440
Caption: basically hex codes are broken down into

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.280
Caption: three components so there&#39;s a red

00:46:19.439 --> 00:46:22.479
Caption: component a green component and a blue

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.199
Caption: component

00:46:22.479 --> 00:46:27.679
Caption: um so we&#39;re going to translate this

00:46:25.199 --> 00:46:29.358
Caption: to binary to understand

00:46:27.679 --> 00:46:31.598
Caption: what is going on here and how this

00:46:29.358 --> 00:46:35.118
Caption: actually becomes a color

00:46:31.599 --> 00:46:38.000
Caption: so let&#39;s look at this um

00:46:35.118 --> 00:46:40.879
Caption: let&#39;s look at the red component first

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Caption: so hexadecimal uses a

00:46:40.879 --> 00:46:46.719
Caption: 16 a base 16 numbering system so

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.118
Caption: computers use base two humans use base

00:46:46.719 --> 00:46:50.719
Caption: 10 hexadecimals like lol or low let&#39;s

00:46:49.118 --> 00:46:53.039
Caption: use base 16.

00:46:50.719 --> 00:46:54.639
Caption: but we as humans we only have 10 numbers

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.160
Caption: to work with or 10 digits to work with

00:46:54.639 --> 00:46:58.959
Caption: and this is where the letters come in so

00:46:56.159 --> 00:47:00.479
Caption: once we get to 10 us humans we go okay

00:46:58.959 --> 00:47:02.239
Caption: no worries we got an alphabet it&#39;s all

00:47:00.479 --> 00:47:03.919
Caption: good so this is where a through f comes

00:47:02.239 --> 00:47:05.520
Caption: in and that&#39;s why you can&#39;t go past f

00:47:03.919 --> 00:47:07.838
Caption: it&#39;s because we&#39;ve reached 15

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:09.599
Caption: hexadecimal being base 16 that&#39;s all we

00:47:07.839 --> 00:47:11.920
Caption: need

00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:14.000
Caption: so um let&#39;s look at the

00:47:11.919 --> 00:47:16.559
Caption: uh red component of the purple color

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.560
Caption: here so i&#39;ve got the um his decimal

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:20.400
Caption: reference at the top to help us out so

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.520
Caption: when i&#39;ve got um

00:47:20.399 --> 00:47:23.520
Caption: five so i&#39;m just going to look at that

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:26.959
Caption: first five initially

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:28.640
Caption: this is it in binary so 0 1 0 1. awesome

00:47:26.959 --> 00:47:30.559
Caption: when i get to the f

00:47:28.639 --> 00:47:33.439
Caption: i have to check my little reference at

00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:35.040
Caption: the top here so f is 15 or the maximum

00:47:33.439 --> 00:47:37.598
Caption: that we can use which means all four

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.760
Caption: bits are turned on 1 1 1 1. awesome

00:47:37.599 --> 00:47:42.640
Caption: we&#39;ve converted red same with green so

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:44.399
Caption: we&#39;ve got three a three uh

00:47:42.639 --> 00:47:46.639
Caption: we already have that number so we don&#39;t

00:47:44.399 --> 00:47:48.639
Caption: need to map it to a letter um a however

00:47:46.639 --> 00:47:51.519
Caption: has to be represented by 10 and in

00:47:48.639 --> 00:47:54.000
Caption: binary these look like come on look like

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.800
Caption: this and same with

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.599
Caption: b

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.679
Caption: so

00:47:55.599 --> 00:47:58.880
Caption: that is the mapping from the hexadecimal

00:47:57.679 --> 00:48:01.439
Caption: to binary

00:47:58.879 --> 00:48:03.279
Caption: the reason that we have hexadecimal is

00:48:01.439 --> 00:48:05.598
Caption: exactly so that we don&#39;t have to write

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:08.079
Caption: this out so hexadecimal is actually just

00:48:05.599 --> 00:48:09.760
Caption: a shorthand for binary it&#39;s not special

00:48:08.079 --> 00:48:11.920
Caption: to colors it&#39;s just a really common

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.359
Caption: place where we use it so usually when we

00:48:11.919 --> 00:48:14.879
Caption: say hex codes as developers we&#39;re

00:48:13.358 --> 00:48:17.199
Caption: probably referring to this but it&#39;s just

00:48:14.879 --> 00:48:18.879
Caption: a shorthand it&#39;s it&#39;s just coincidence

00:48:17.199 --> 00:48:21.679
Caption: that that&#39;s where we most commonly use

00:48:18.879 --> 00:48:22.959
Caption: it

00:48:21.679 --> 00:48:24.639
Caption: so

00:48:22.959 --> 00:48:27.199
Caption: i would like to point out here that each

00:48:24.639 --> 00:48:29.199
Caption: of these components so that r g and b

00:48:27.199 --> 00:48:31.838
Caption: those are each using eight bits so

00:48:29.199 --> 00:48:33.838
Caption: together that&#39;s 24 bits

00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:36.160
Caption: and so just like our rgb color we have a

00:48:33.839 --> 00:48:37.680
Caption: 24 bit color again and so these can be

00:48:36.159 --> 00:48:39.598
Caption: mapped between each other so this is why

00:48:37.679 --> 00:48:41.358
Caption: you&#39;re able to google like rgb to hex

00:48:39.599 --> 00:48:43.040
Caption: code or vice versa it&#39;s because

00:48:41.358 --> 00:48:44.479
Caption: underneath the hood it&#39;s all just binary

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.239
Caption: that we&#39;ve been uh that we&#39;re converting

00:48:44.479 --> 00:48:48.319
Caption: between the two of them and as far as

00:48:46.239 --> 00:48:49.679
Caption: css is concerned it doesn&#39;t matter which

00:48:48.319 --> 00:48:51.359
Caption: one you use it&#39;s just going to convert

00:48:49.679 --> 00:48:53.040
Caption: it to binary anyway so it&#39;s really about

00:48:51.358 --> 00:48:55.759
Caption: personal preference

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:57.599
Caption: and rgb and hex are really commonly used

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.919
Caption: because hex is like you know super easy

00:48:57.599 --> 00:49:01.200
Caption: to copy paste rgb is really easy to use

00:48:59.919 --> 00:49:02.639
Caption: because if you know that it&#39;s the red

00:49:01.199 --> 00:49:03.760
Caption: green and blue component you could tweak

00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:05.039
Caption: the numbers

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.880
Caption: in your head without having to look it

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.479
Caption: up depends how much of a nerd you are i

00:49:06.879 --> 00:49:10.318
Caption: don&#39;t know i do that

00:49:08.479 --> 00:49:12.959
Caption: um

00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:15.440
Caption: all right i&#39;m back so

00:49:12.959 --> 00:49:17.838
Caption: there are a bunch of other models that

00:49:15.439 --> 00:49:19.919
Caption: we could go into if we wanted to but i

00:49:17.839 --> 00:49:22.239
Caption: won&#39;t put you through all of that

00:49:19.919 --> 00:49:25.679
Caption: but i made a list of just a few of them

00:49:22.239 --> 00:49:28.800
Caption: so we had a look at ryb rgbh we did not

00:49:25.679 --> 00:49:30.159
Caption: look at hsl we looked at cmycmyk and hex

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.359
Caption: but there are a bunch of others these

00:49:30.159 --> 00:49:33.358
Caption: are just some ones that i randomly

00:49:31.358 --> 00:49:35.439
Caption: googled some of them are in css some of

00:49:33.358 --> 00:49:38.879
Caption: them are applied elsewhere um so for

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:41.280
Caption: example cmy cmyk that&#39;s used in printing

00:49:38.879 --> 00:49:42.639
Caption: so if you think um

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.760
Caption: do you want to have a printer anymore

00:49:42.639 --> 00:49:45.118
Caption: but if you think to the days of a

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.639
Caption: printer

00:49:45.118 --> 00:49:48.959
Caption: and you had like

00:49:46.639 --> 00:49:50.399
Caption: the cyan magenta magenta and yellow

00:49:48.959 --> 00:49:53.280
Caption: cartridge and then a black one that

00:49:50.399 --> 00:49:54.399
Caption: comes from cmyk the k being black or the

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.919
Caption: key color

00:49:54.399 --> 00:49:57.760
Caption: and the reason that you had to add black

00:49:55.919 --> 00:49:59.280
Caption: separately i always thought it was just

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.118
Caption: because you use more black ink that was

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:03.199
Caption: not the case it&#39;s because you can&#39;t make

00:50:01.118 --> 00:50:05.358
Caption: black with c and y the closest you can

00:50:03.199 --> 00:50:07.280
Caption: get is like a really muddy brown

00:50:05.358 --> 00:50:08.959
Caption: so i thought that was interesting

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.719
Caption: and also the reason it&#39;s called k they

00:50:08.959 --> 00:50:12.639
Caption: say it&#39;s because key color but actually

00:50:10.719 --> 00:50:15.358
Caption: b was taken by blue so they had to give

00:50:12.639 --> 00:50:15.358
Caption: it a different name

00:50:16.239 --> 00:50:18.800
Caption: okay

00:50:17.439 --> 00:50:20.078
Caption: so

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:23.119
Caption: why

00:50:20.079 --> 00:50:25.440
Caption: why did i put you through a good 50

00:50:23.118 --> 00:50:26.879
Caption: minutes now on a talk about color why

00:50:25.439 --> 00:50:28.318
Caption: did i bring paint in why did i bring

00:50:26.879 --> 00:50:29.358
Caption: torches and why did i put you through

00:50:28.319 --> 00:50:31.599
Caption: this

00:50:29.358 --> 00:50:33.519
Caption: so firstly i&#39;d like to remind you that

00:50:31.599 --> 00:50:34.880
Caption: you picked this room i&#39;m really sorry to

00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:35.839
Caption: you

00:50:34.879 --> 00:50:37.838
Caption: um

00:50:35.839 --> 00:50:39.520
Caption: this started so the reason that i wanted

00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:42.079
Caption: to give this talk is it started when i

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.919
Caption: saw a front-end developer tweet oh my

00:50:42.079 --> 00:50:45.760
Caption: gosh this is how hex codes work and they

00:50:43.919 --> 00:50:47.040
Caption: had this big tweet thread about this

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.719
Caption: discovery they&#39;d made when they suddenly

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.559
Caption: learned how these things worked and i

00:50:48.719 --> 00:50:52.239
Caption: was reading this tweet like wait people

00:50:50.559 --> 00:50:54.239
Caption: don&#39;t know this like this isn&#39;t just

00:50:52.239 --> 00:50:56.159
Caption: common knowledge and i&#39;m like no people

00:50:54.239 --> 00:50:58.719
Caption: have hobbies people don&#39;t spend their

00:50:56.159 --> 00:51:00.318
Caption: weekends googling how x codes work and

00:50:58.719 --> 00:51:01.679
Caption: binary and about light waves and retinas

00:51:00.319 --> 00:51:03.520
Caption: that&#39;s just me

00:51:01.679 --> 00:51:05.199
Caption: so i thought that if that front-end

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.399
Caption: developer found this interesting maybe

00:51:05.199 --> 00:51:08.479
Caption: other developers would find this

00:51:06.399 --> 00:51:10.479
Caption: interesting as well and again i feel

00:51:08.479 --> 00:51:12.719
Caption: validated because the number of people

00:51:10.479 --> 00:51:15.280
Caption: in this room slowly increased as i was

00:51:12.719 --> 00:51:17.118
Caption: talking so i&#39;m feeling pretty good right

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:18.079
Caption: now so that was one reason i just

00:51:17.118 --> 00:51:19.199
Caption: thought it was interesting maybe

00:51:18.079 --> 00:51:20.720
Caption: somebody else would be interested in

00:51:19.199 --> 00:51:23.760
Caption: this as well

00:51:20.719 --> 00:51:25.439
Caption: but more than that um i like to when i&#39;m

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.280
Caption: teaching because i i teach people how to

00:51:25.439 --> 00:51:28.800
Caption: code all the time and i try to put in

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.479
Caption: perspective hey it&#39;s not actually just

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:32.719
Caption: about the computer like and the way the

00:51:30.479 --> 00:51:35.439
Caption: computer works it&#39;s not a coincidence so

00:51:32.719 --> 00:51:36.959
Caption: we use these things a lot so us we&#39;re at

00:51:35.439 --> 00:51:38.639
Caption: a developer conference like we live on

00:51:36.959 --> 00:51:40.000
Caption: computers but so does everybody else

00:51:38.639 --> 00:51:41.519
Caption: like these things like really influence

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.040
Caption: something like ingrained in our everyday

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.239
Caption: lives now and so i think it&#39;s kind of

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.479
Caption: important that we have some

00:51:44.239 --> 00:51:47.839
Caption: understanding of how these things work

00:51:46.479 --> 00:51:49.919
Caption: so like

00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:51.599
Caption: to me it&#39;s just a middle box but to

00:51:49.919 --> 00:51:52.719
Caption: other people they&#39;re just magical and

00:51:51.599 --> 00:51:54.160
Caption: it&#39;s so fascinating it&#39;s this

00:51:52.719 --> 00:51:55.679
Caption: all-knowing thing and oh no what if i

00:51:54.159 --> 00:51:57.679
Caption: mess up what if i do something wrong but

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:58.800
Caption: it&#39;s just a metal box it was created by

00:51:57.679 --> 00:52:00.719
Caption: humans

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:02.640
Caption: for humans to make our lives easier and

00:52:00.719 --> 00:52:04.479
Caption: how it works is pretty cool but it&#39;s

00:52:02.639 --> 00:52:06.719
Caption: definitely not magic and the stuff

00:52:04.479 --> 00:52:08.319
Caption: doesn&#39;t have to be so inaccessible so

00:52:06.719 --> 00:52:09.679
Caption: whenever you&#39;re writing some code you&#39;re

00:52:08.319 --> 00:52:10.960
Caption: like man i wonder how that hex code

00:52:09.679 --> 00:52:12.159
Caption: works like this is something that you

00:52:10.959 --> 00:52:14.000
Caption: could google and figure out if you

00:52:12.159 --> 00:52:15.598
Caption: wanted to um

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.159
Caption: it&#39;s not actually as complicated as a

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:20.319
Caption: lot of people might think it is so

00:52:18.159 --> 00:52:22.479
Caption: basically i just think that computers

00:52:20.319 --> 00:52:24.000
Caption: don&#39;t need to be such a mystery um and i

00:52:22.479 --> 00:52:25.199
Caption: find the stuff really interesting and i

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.639
Caption: really hope

00:52:25.199 --> 00:52:27.838
Caption: that you found it interesting as well

00:52:26.639 --> 00:52:29.919
Caption: and i hope that when you next go to

00:52:27.839 --> 00:52:31.040
Caption: write a hix or an rgb code in your css

00:52:29.919 --> 00:52:33.199
Caption: you&#39;re going to smile and pause and be

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:36.000
Caption: like hey i know how that works

00:52:33.199 --> 00:52:37.199
Caption: so thank you so much to listening to me

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.479
Caption: today

00:52:37.199 --> 00:52:40.399
Caption: check me and follow on twitter if you

00:52:38.479 --> 00:52:41.679
Caption: want to talk about colors or dogs or

00:52:40.399 --> 00:52:43.279
Caption: coding fails

00:52:41.679 --> 00:52:46.419
Caption: and feel free to check out my blog for a

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:49.919
Caption: summary of this talk thank you

00:52:46.419 --> 00:52:49.919
Caption: [Applause]
