  "description": "We all use colours. Maybe you are a seasoned front end developer or designer, your custom terminal colour scheme is something to behold, or perhaps your small child (or you) is currently going through a finger painting stage. Regardless of what part of tech you work in, you have encountered a situation when you\u0027ve had to select some colours. The question is, when you pick a colour on a colour wheel or type in a hex or RGB code, how does that colour actually appear on the screen?\\n\\nCome and learn about the Computer Science of colour with me. In this talk, we\u0027re going to dig deeper into hex codes. What do they mean, how and why do they get converted to RGB codes, and how does a computer use that to generate a colour we can see? We\u0027ll unpack it all by learning binary, enjoying a #throwback to mixing paint in kindergarten, and taking a much closer look at the human eye.\\n\\nYou will leave this talk with a whole new appreciation and understanding for the science behind something as simple as colour, something you have likely never thought twice about. This talk is not just for designers and front end developers, there is something interesting for everyone to learn here.\\n\\n--\\nI am a developer and educator, and have been teaching others to code for as long as I have been coding myself. I am a firm believer that anyone can learn to code, and prove it by dedicating a lot of my working and personal life to helping to improve the diversity in the tech industry.\\n\\nI have extensive experience in writing resources and teaching workshops about Computer Science and Programming for all ages and experience levels. My ability to describe technical details in a simple manner certainly sets me apart from others in my field and makes me an asset to any team.\\n\\nIn my spare time I can be found teaching my dog tricks, watching Netflix and yelling at \\"
