00:00:16.138 --> 00:00:19.858

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.790
Caption: you away from this sort of end of and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.889
Caption: celebrations that that will follow but I

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.190
Caption: do want to discuss at a very personal

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:42.689
Caption: level I guess mental health but also

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:45.360
Caption: really give you some practical tips and

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:47.939
Caption: tools to take away to your workplaces to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.000
Caption: help you take action at an individual

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:52.378
Caption: level but also an organizational level

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.680
Caption: but some background before we get there

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.980
Caption: who here has heard of beyondblue it&#39;s

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.809
Caption: phenomenal and just to I guess give some

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.228
Caption: context to that beyondblue was formed by

00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:06.330
Caption: the Honorable Jeff Kennedy in 2000 it

00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:08.158
Caption: was really and always has been about

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.889
Caption: raising an understanding and awareness

00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:12.478
Caption: of depression and anxiety and combating

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:15.720
Caption: the stigma associated with that

00:01:12.478 --> 00:01:17.609
Caption: discussion and I think as a society and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.110
Caption: particularly within Australia there is a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.629
Caption: greater awareness but there&#39;s still a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.408
Caption: lot to do in this space but it was also

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:27.360
Caption: about guiding people to help our vision

00:01:25.408 --> 00:01:29.519
Caption: is to help all Australians achieve their

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.569
Caption: best possible mental health and so we do

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:35.789
Caption: provide some phenomenal services our

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.319
Caption: 24/7 support line the beyondblue forums

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.970
Caption: and a whole range of other services that

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.529
Caption: are there to help people manage their

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.919
Caption: mental health and manage it when they&#39;re

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:46.349
Caption: doing it rough I&#39;d also like to point

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:49.589
Caption: out that you know part of that has I

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:50.970
Caption: guess remit has expanded over the course

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:53.250
Caption: of the last five years where we&#39;re

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.200
Caption: looking at suicide prevention and

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.479
Caption: suicide awareness and the reasons for

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:59.849
Caption: that will become pretty stark shortly

00:01:57.478 --> 00:02:01.339
Caption: but also providing even more tools and

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.769
Caption: that&#39;s where the heads up initiative

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:07.019
Caption: comes into play heads up of free tools

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:08.699
Caption: and resources for organizations to take

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:11.128
Caption: action on workplace mental health I&#39;m

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.360
Caption: standing here as an employee of

00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:14.550
Caption: beyondblue

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.820
Caption: but actually heads up is supported by a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.750
Caption: whole range of wonderful organization

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.920
Caption: federal and state government bodies

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.399
Caption: industry bodies business groups and also

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:28.229
Caption: a range of supporters from the middle

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.729
Caption: health sector great organizations like

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:32.159
Caption: the Black Dog Institute insane

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:33.479
Caption: and so it&#39;s kind of with pleasure that

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.070
Caption: towards the end of this you&#39;ll get some

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:37.769
Caption: resources that I think are really

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.270
Caption: valuable in evidence-based and one other

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.400
Caption: thing if I might say and Michelle

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.580
Caption: mentioned it I stand here today speaking

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:46.199
Caption: to you not as someone that has you know

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.139
Caption: as a clinician or a doctor or a

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:51.958
Caption: psychologist or a counselor in fact my

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:54.750
Caption: role before joining beyondblue was with

00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:57.238
Caption: the technology company ratify not as a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.080
Caption: software developer I was in their

00:02:57.238 --> 00:03:03.389
Caption: marketing team and I think that the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.580
Caption: reason that I&#39;m here today is in part

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.319
Caption: because ratified gave me the confidence

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.180
Caption: to talked about to talk about my

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.410
Caption: experience some eight or nine years

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:12.899
Caption: earlier when I was diagnosed with

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.430
Caption: clinical depression ratify was kind of

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:16.919
Caption: challenging because I entered an

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:19.589
Caption: organization where there was pretty an

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.419
Caption: open dialogue you know everyone felt and

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:23.548
Caption: could have a discussion about just about

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.958
Caption: anything in that business and it was

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:27.539
Caption: direct discussions and our open

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.979
Caption: discussions and that was challenging for

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.139
Caption: me I come from some pretty conservative

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.268
Caption: environments but it was kind of cool too

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.419
Caption: and it was that environment that

00:03:33.268 --> 00:03:39.330
Caption: actually enabled me I guess to kind of

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:41.399
Caption: go hang on I&#39;ve got this experience and

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.619
Caption: I&#39;m not talking about it could I perhaps

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:46.649
Caption: talk about mental health in the

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:48.629
Caption: workplace more than I do because I was

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:51.298
Caption: watching this sort of vibrant discussion

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.309
Caption: occur you know in an in a company and an

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:54.929
Caption: industry that I hadn&#39;t been part of so I

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:57.360
Caption: approached the board and the executive

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:59.129
Caption: and said do you mind if I if I enter

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.169
Caption: this space and I volunteered for

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.760
Caption: beyondblue you&#39;ll hear a little bit

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.139
Caption: about that personal story today it&#39;s not

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:06.059
Caption: that staggering to be honest it&#39;s

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:09.119
Caption: actually about life but the net result

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:12.750
Caption: is I&#39;m speaking to you as a peer not as

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:15.089
Caption: a clinician or a doctor and we&#39;ll see

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.589
Caption: the importance that those trained

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:18.119
Caption: professionals have as well as we move

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:20.130
Caption: through so we&#39;re going to talk about

00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:23.690
Caption: four topics understanding mental health

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.250
Caption: at very much a lay persons view

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.750
Caption: certainly whyme workplace

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.970
Caption: mental health is important and giving it

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.500
Caption: some context around workplaces and you

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.970
Caption: know I&#39;ll touch on the the nuances of

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.000
Caption: the software industry but generally

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.160
Caption: workplaces how do we go about creating

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.570
Caption: mentally healthy workplaces and again

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.429
Caption: finishing with some tools and tips that

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.050
Caption: I hope you can take back and and and

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:47.130
Caption: help either yourselves or your

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:48.869
Caption: colleagues so why and we&#39;re here and

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.820
Caption: let&#39;s talk about mental health I think

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:53.399
Caption: the important aspect of talking about

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.770
Caption: mental health is that often when we

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:59.160
Caption: think about mental health we think about

00:04:55.769 --> 00:05:01.559
Caption: mental ill-health we think about illness

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.679
Caption: and that&#39;s really important because we

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:06.600
Caption: need to understand that but actually if

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:09.179
Caption: we think about the World Health

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.740
Caption: Organization definition for mental

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:12.239
Caption: health it&#39;s about contributing life in

00:05:10.739 --> 00:05:15.989
Caption: all aspects of life wherever we are

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:17.699
Caption: family work the settings that we we we

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:19.699
Caption: live our life in and it&#39;s also about

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.380
Caption: being in a position where we can manage

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.620
Caption: the normal stresses and strains of life

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.970
Caption: and that&#39;s mental health I actually find

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:28.559
Caption: it easier rather than going on a

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.489
Caption: definition like that to think about it

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:35.429
Caption: in the point of a color continuum if you

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:38.039
Caption: like and here we have you know green on

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:40.829
Caption: the on the left hand side that is really

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.450
Caption: around us and individuals when they&#39;re

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:45.000
Caption: thriving and they&#39;re contributing and

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:48.720
Caption: they&#39;re living a life that is full and

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.220
Caption: we are healthy but we also need to

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.279
Caption: understand that mental health is not a

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.049
Caption: static state that runs that range you

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:57.690
Caption: know through amber and orange and into

00:05:55.049 --> 00:05:59.250
Caption: red where we have clinical conditions

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.600
Caption: and where indeed I ended up with

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.510
Caption: clinical depression about eight years

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.070
Caption: ago in professional services firm and I

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.200
Caption: want to dig into that a little bit

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.610
Caption: because it&#39;s really important that yes

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.160
Caption: we support people with a mental health

00:06:08.609 --> 00:06:14.069
Caption: condition but we don&#39;t actually treat

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.899
Caption: that as the other that it&#39;s actually for

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.000
Caption: all of us mental health is about all of

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:20.549
Caption: us it&#39;s about life and it&#39;s about

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.320
Caption: keeping the healthy healthy and if we as

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:24.779
Caption: individuals or in our colleagues and our

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.339
Caption: peers and our friends see people with

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:27.500
Caption: changes in behavior I&#39;ll start to talk

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:30.029
Caption: about some of the signs and symptoms

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:33.149
Caption: then we kind of need to know how to take

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:34.859
Caption: action either ourselves or to help

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:37.098
Caption: others to help them move back into the

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:40.019
Caption: green it&#39;s not always going to work

00:06:37.098 --> 00:06:41.669
Caption: there&#39;s no there&#39;s some things that we

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:43.348
Caption: try our best but it&#39;s important to

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:45.598
Caption: really understand that when we talk

00:06:43.348 --> 00:06:47.459
Caption: about mental health we&#39;re talking about

00:06:45.598 --> 00:06:51.119
Caption: that continuum we&#39;re talking about

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:53.339
Caption: everyone in this room and rather than

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.239
Caption: think about it as illness and supporting

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:58.109
Caption: people with the illness which is

00:06:54.239 --> 00:07:00.598
Caption: critical think about it as affecting us

00:06:58.109 --> 00:07:05.549
Caption: all because it is about being in the

00:07:00.598 --> 00:07:08.399
Caption: green the amber and the red if I talked

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:12.690
Caption: a little bit about my experience I I

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:15.389
Caption: guess you know again there&#39;s no amazing

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.908
Caption: story here essentially what it is is

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:20.339
Caption: that I was in various roles in a

00:07:17.908 --> 00:07:23.639
Caption: commercial environment and ended up

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:28.889
Caption: where I I guess I couldn&#39;t operate my

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:30.539
Caption: life was impacted for me I&#39;m a an

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:33.210
Caption: anxious person and here&#39;s some of the

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:35.190
Caption: signs and symptoms of anxiety now please

00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:37.500
Caption: don&#39;t think that you know if you&#39;ve got

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.309
Caption: a sign or a symptom that all of a sudden

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.690
Caption: you&#39;ve got some clinical condition no

00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:44.789
Caption: it&#39;s more about understanding and

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:47.039
Caption: recognizing these signs and symptoms in

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:50.239
Caption: ourselves and others and I would argue

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:52.500
Caption: that for many times throughout my life I

00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:53.759
Caption: didn&#39;t really get this and if I did I

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.739
Caption: certainly didn&#39;t think I needed help

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:57.179
Caption: around it but I at heart I&#39;m a pretty

00:07:55.739 --> 00:07:59.819
Caption: anxious person I can tell you I didn&#39;t

00:07:57.179 --> 00:08:01.559
Caption: sleep a lot last night I do a number of

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:02.549
Caption: presentations but I still get really

00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:04.019
Caption: nervous about them

00:08:02.549 --> 00:08:05.309
Caption: I still think hang on there&#39;s a whole

00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:07.559
Caption: heap of people here that want to learn

00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:10.559
Caption: and have an appetite to learn and what

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:12.269
Caption: the hell am I going to say i overthink

00:08:10.559 --> 00:08:13.889
Caption: it I there&#39;s there&#39;s feelings of dread

00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:15.388
Caption: all the time but now I know how to

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:17.098
Caption: better manage that but I guess more

00:08:15.389 --> 00:08:21.210
Caption: importantly as we look at those signs

00:08:17.098 --> 00:08:22.739
Caption: and symptoms of anxiety you know it was

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.658
Caption: depression that I got to and

00:08:22.739 --> 00:08:26.459
Caption: understanding the signs and symptoms of

00:08:24.658 --> 00:08:30.389
Caption: depression and for me

00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:31.949
Caption: thinking back all that time ago I got to

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:37.078
Caption: a stage where I probably hadn&#39;t slept

00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:39.898
Caption: for three or four months I&#39;d go to bed

00:08:37.078 --> 00:08:41.338
Caption: at say ten o&#39;clock I would fall asleep

00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:42.929
Caption: on the couch probably for an hour an

00:08:41.338 --> 00:08:45.890
Caption: hour hour and a bit after sort of just

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:48.719
Caption: being drained from work I go to bed

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:50.880
Caption: 11:00 wake up at midnight my beautiful

00:08:48.719 --> 00:08:52.469
Caption: wife is next to me and I would just toss

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.489
Caption: and turn all night so I was lacking

00:08:52.469 --> 00:08:55.588
Caption: sleep

00:08:53.489 --> 00:08:57.000
Caption: I was really doubting my ability to add

00:08:55.588 --> 00:08:59.130
Caption: value anywhere I didn&#39;t think I was the

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.838
Caption: greatest dad I didn&#39;t think I was the

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:04.049
Caption: greatest manager I didn&#39;t think I really

00:09:00.838 --> 00:09:06.179
Caption: had any sort of value and I really think

00:09:04.049 --> 00:09:08.309
Caption: I need to point out here that I&#39;m pretty

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:10.049
Caption: fortunate now I got a beautiful wife of

00:09:08.309 --> 00:09:12.179
Caption: 23 years I&#39;ve got two beautiful

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:15.958
Caption: daughters I&#39;ve never my family has never

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:21.510
Caption: been beset by tragedy touch some woods

00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:23.250
Caption: somewhere and and and I&#39;ve had and have

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.380
Caption: great social networks and I mean that in

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.880
Caption: terms of friends and family I strangely

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.979
Caption: I&#39;m not on Twitter and I&#39;m not on

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.239
Caption: Facebook I am on LinkedIn but social

00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:31.889
Caption: networks in the point of view of

00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:34.619
Caption: actually you know having some really

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.359
Caption: great relationships so there is no

00:09:34.619 --> 00:09:38.309
Caption: actual logical reason why someone would

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:42.958
Caption: like me would fall into clinical

00:09:38.309 --> 00:09:44.820
Caption: depression but I did because looking

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.528
Caption: back I don&#39;t really think I understood

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.000
Caption: the science and symptoms or a solis that

00:09:46.528 --> 00:09:49.559
Caption: didn&#39;t take them seriously or or I

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.059
Caption: thought that I didn&#39;t need to talk about

00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:58.140
Caption: it I could work it out myself and I

00:09:54.059 --> 00:10:00.778
Caption: couldn&#39;t and here&#39;s where it becomes

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.400
Caption: really important you know I think that

00:10:00.778 --> 00:10:04.200
Caption: I&#39;ll think about it logically as a

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.760
Caption: business person right now I go well if

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.708
Caption: we don&#39;t know something about software

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.208
Caption: we bring in a software consultant or we

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:10.409
Caption: bring in the specialists and we actually

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:12.838
Caption: go you know what help us here I don&#39;t

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:14.489
Caption: know what I&#39;m doing if we break our leg

00:10:12.838 --> 00:10:17.309
Caption: we definitely go to the doctor we know

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:19.080
Caption: what to do if we&#39;re doing a merger and

00:10:17.309 --> 00:10:21.958
Caption: acquisition or something we get the the

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:25.140
Caption: professionals in yet if we&#39;re doing it

00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:28.559
Caption: tough mentally we think somehow we&#39;ve

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:30.059
Caption: figured out ourselves and I believe that

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:31.979
Caption: we actually need to have the

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:33.330
Caption: conversation firmly believe we need to

00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:37.169
Caption: have the conversation around mental

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:41.040
Caption: health both in terms of individuals and

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:43.169
Caption: looking after our own mental health but

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:45.750
Caption: also in looking after and supporting

00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:47.578
Caption: others and why do I say this because the

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.760
Caption: conversation is essentially what

00:10:47.578 --> 00:10:53.778
Caption: eventually helped me even though I kept

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:58.850
Caption: the mask on for god knows how many years

00:10:53.778 --> 00:11:02.578
Caption: eventually it broke and I broke

00:10:58.849 --> 00:11:05.159
Caption: eventually you know I&#39;d be managing

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:07.389
Caption: teams in organizations and what would

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:09.500
Caption: happen is I&#39;d go to the toilet and cry

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.090
Caption: while I&#39;m making decisions for the

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.440
Caption: company that were you know generally

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.930
Caption: probably pretty good still probably I

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.220
Caption: was affected but I&#39;d be a mess people

00:11:14.929 --> 00:11:18.250
Caption: are coming to me as a leader and I&#39;m

00:11:16.219 --> 00:11:21.049
Caption: kind of going yep I can I can do this

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:23.960
Caption: and I would I think I would offer pretty

00:11:21.049 --> 00:11:25.729
Caption: wise counsel I think but I wouldn&#39;t see

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.890
Caption: me go into the toilet and just basically

00:11:25.729 --> 00:11:29.779
Caption: break down or go home and be a mess and

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.670
Caption: not be able to contribute then to my

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.610
Caption: home life and and everything else that

00:11:31.669 --> 00:11:39.380
Caption: was going on and eventually it was Sarah

00:11:34.609 --> 00:11:40.849
Caption: my wife that said mark I can&#39;t help you

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.750
Caption: no you need to go and get help and

00:11:40.849 --> 00:11:47.169
Caption: somehow and she&#39;d said that a lot right

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:49.729
Caption: somehow eventually I went to the doctor

00:11:47.169 --> 00:11:51.799
Caption: so having the conversation with my wife

00:11:49.729 --> 00:11:53.389
Caption: at at this at the smallest but I

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:54.979
Caption: certainly wasn&#39;t Harry in the workplace

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:58.429
Caption: at that time give me the scoop and I

00:11:54.979 --> 00:12:00.559
Caption: wasn&#39;t telling my friends but it enabled

00:11:58.429 --> 00:12:02.839
Caption: me to actually realize that hang on I

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:07.309
Caption: probably should even if it&#39;s to humor

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:09.320
Caption: Sarah and I went to the doctor and and I

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:10.760
Caption: think that here&#39;s the next part yes we

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.520
Caption: need to increase our understanding and

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.350
Caption: we need to understand that actually

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.290
Caption: mental health is about life and that we

00:12:15.349 --> 00:12:20.690
Caption: go up and down through that continuing

00:12:18.289 --> 00:12:22.009
Caption: that I was talking about we need to

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.200
Caption: better understand those signs and

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:26.720
Caption: symptoms and then feel more confident to

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.030
Caption: have the conversations but actually it&#39;s

00:12:26.719 --> 00:12:32.509
Caption: not coming to people like me with a you

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:34.430
Caption: know a personal experience albeit that&#39;s

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:36.290
Caption: good it&#39;s actually reaching out to the

00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:38.359
Caption: professionals the doctors the resources

00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:40.549
Caption: that beyondblue at lifeline counselors

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:42.380
Caption: psychologists for me I went to the

00:12:40.549 --> 00:12:46.549
Caption: doctor and I remember it clearly

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:48.650
Caption: dr. advocate and and you know again it&#39;s

00:12:46.549 --> 00:12:50.570
Caption: it&#39;s it seems pretty simple but it was

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.470
Caption: hard because I I&#39;m not thinking I&#39;m I&#39;m

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.479
Caption: okay yeah

00:12:51.469 --> 00:12:54.919
Caption: but I&#39;m not and the doctor said why

00:12:53.479 --> 00:12:58.549
Caption: you&#39;re here and I said cuz Sarah said I

00:12:54.919 --> 00:13:00.289
Caption: should come and he went okay well why

00:12:58.549 --> 00:13:02.119
Caption: else here here and I said well she

00:13:00.289 --> 00:13:04.639
Caption: thinks I&#39;ve got you know something going

00:13:02.119 --> 00:13:06.409
Caption: on upstairs and he goes well what&#39;s on

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.739
Caption: your mind and I don&#39;t know why safety

00:13:06.409 --> 00:13:11.659
Caption: environment I just broke down and I just

00:13:09.739 --> 00:13:14.709
Caption: spoke to him for about an hour and 10

00:13:11.659 --> 00:13:17.839
Caption: minutes through a complete not a sort of

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:19.559
Caption: mess of tears as I tried to figure out

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.980
Caption: what it was I was there to talk about

00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:26.010
Caption: I hadn&#39;t kept it all bottled up I should

00:13:22.979 --> 00:13:28.019
Caption: mention as well that you know I guess in

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.580
Caption: in that deepest time for me I again I

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:32.640
Caption: was fortunate because I never really

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:34.140
Caption: considered taking my own life I was more

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.760
Caption: considering walking away from the good

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.109
Caption: life I had I was I was more considering

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.540
Caption: leaving my family leaving my wife

00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:41.579
Caption: leaving my kids or leaving the social

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:43.709
Caption: environments that I was in or and I have

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.838
Caption: left many jobs historically because I

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:48.240
Caption: hadn&#39;t actually thought about and

00:13:45.838 --> 00:13:50.549
Caption: understood the way mental health was

00:13:48.239 --> 00:13:54.778
Caption: impacting me so I&#39;d kind of run away

00:13:50.549 --> 00:13:58.289
Caption: from the problem but that was brilliant

00:13:54.778 --> 00:14:01.559
Caption: because somehow somehow the doctor got

00:13:58.289 --> 00:14:03.539
Caption: through to me said mark you&#39;ll seek your

00:14:01.559 --> 00:14:05.489
Caption: ill and when a doctor says you&#39;re ill

00:14:03.539 --> 00:14:06.809
Caption: something broke through all that the

00:14:05.489 --> 00:14:09.899
Caption: irrational thoughts and I went okay

00:14:06.809 --> 00:14:12.210
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s fine I get that and that

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.559
Caption: was the start I was then able to go and

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:16.710
Caption: see a psychologist and I was able to

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:20.789
Caption: talk things through I somehow felt more

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:22.440
Caption: comfortable talking to you know my wife

00:14:20.789 --> 00:14:24.779
Caption: more about it now that I was talked to a

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.039
Caption: psychologist and I guess the sort of an

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.990
Caption: intake was the right way but the

00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:30.239
Caption: rational part of me was kind of coming

00:14:27.989 --> 00:14:31.709
Caption: through and I could see that actually I

00:14:30.239 --> 00:14:33.630
Caption: had a pretty good life but I still made

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.130
Caption: a whole range of changes small things

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:37.349
Caption: over the course of sort of six months

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.440
Caption: that got me back into the amber and then

00:14:37.349 --> 00:14:41.909
Caption: eventually got me back into into green

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.320
Caption: the small things like you know I started

00:14:41.909 --> 00:14:44.819
Caption: to do a bit more physical exercise

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.869
Caption: started to run a start to go to the gym

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.850
Caption: I studied better

00:14:45.869 --> 00:14:49.049
Caption: you know and and what was happening with

00:14:47.849 --> 00:14:50.849
Caption: the physical exercise for me and

00:14:49.049 --> 00:14:52.260
Caption: everyone&#39;s different by the way you know

00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:55.049
Caption: I&#39;m not saying go do a physical exercise

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.729
Caption: and fix mental health no but I am saying

00:14:55.049 --> 00:14:58.169
Caption: for me that meant I was tired and I was

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:59.279
Caption: physically tired so actually what would

00:14:58.169 --> 00:15:01.979
Caption: happen I&#39;d hit the pillow and I&#39;d go to

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.900
Caption: sleep and I&#39;d sleep Wow

00:15:01.979 --> 00:15:05.969
Caption: you know when you sleep how good is that

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.380
Caption: you know all of a sudden you wake up and

00:15:05.969 --> 00:15:08.279
Caption: you got a clearer mind and you&#39;re

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.630
Caption: actually going to have a greater

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:15.150
Caption: propensity to talk you know and so over

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:17.640
Caption: the course of time by getting support by

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.050
Caption: seeking support I was able to move back

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.330
Caption: into the amber and back into the green

00:15:19.049 --> 00:15:24.778
Caption: and pleasingly I know I still know my

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:26.330
Caption: own triggers and that I believe I

00:15:24.778 --> 00:15:29.279
Caption: managed my mental health quite well now

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.600
Caption: but when you know I see and get some of

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.940
Caption: these signs and symptoms that I talk

00:15:30.599 --> 00:15:34.469
Caption: about I know that I need to act

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.000
Caption: and that act might be to talk to someone

00:15:34.469 --> 00:15:37.799
Caption: I&#39;m like we go back to a psychologist it

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.270
Caption: might be actually to you know go to the

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:41.339
Caption: gym and just break it or go for a ride

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.200
Caption: or do whatever it might be but rather

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:46.170
Caption: than circle into a mire of my own

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.780
Caption: negative thoughts try and break that so

00:15:46.169 --> 00:15:50.609
Caption: in telling that normally to be quite

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.080
Caption: honest apart from when I was

00:15:50.609 --> 00:15:53.489
Caption: volunteering haven&#39;t haven&#39;t sort of

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.470
Caption: spoken about that for a little while but

00:15:53.489 --> 00:15:58.739
Caption: Rob sort of asked and and sure a lot

00:15:55.469 --> 00:16:00.299
Caption: more all I&#39;m trying to say there is that

00:15:58.739 --> 00:16:01.979
Caption: really there&#39;s nothing special about

00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:04.469
Caption: that story right I mean this is just

00:16:01.979 --> 00:16:06.929
Caption: life it&#39;s someone that is you know has a

00:16:04.469 --> 00:16:09.029
Caption: pretty good life and poor me I was

00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:11.369
Caption: managing depression but the net result

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:13.350
Caption: is is that I was able to get myself back

00:16:11.369 --> 00:16:15.539
Caption: into a really strong player strong

00:16:13.349 --> 00:16:17.609
Caption: enough that when I was if I I wanted to

00:16:15.539 --> 00:16:20.209
Caption: actually speak about it in the workplace

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:23.459
Caption: to leaders because we need to do more

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:25.760
Caption: and so that&#39;s a sort of baseline

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:29.160
Caption: understanding of mental health

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:33.169
Caption: why is workplace mental health important

00:16:29.159 --> 00:16:35.339
Caption: well again I know we&#39;ve got you know

00:16:33.169 --> 00:16:37.469
Caption: celebrations coming up but I just kind

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.270
Caption: of want to say that it&#39;s important

00:16:37.469 --> 00:16:44.369
Caption: because what we have here is a societal

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:46.320
Caption: issue in Australia nearly eight people

00:16:44.369 --> 00:16:49.200
Caption: take their lives their own lives every

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:53.520
Caption: day it&#39;s about two and a half times it

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:56.070
Caption: right all for every eight and people

00:16:53.520 --> 00:17:02.100
Caption: that take their own lives about 30

00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:04.349
Caption: people attempt we also know that at any

00:17:02.099 --> 00:17:06.448
Caption: given time around 3 million people will

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:09.958
Caption: be managing depression and/or anxiety

00:17:06.448 --> 00:17:11.458
Caption: now there&#39;s no you know some people will

00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958
Caption: take their own lives without exhibiting

00:17:11.458 --> 00:17:15.420
Caption: any signs and symptoms of depression

00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:17.489
Caption: anxiety or a clinical condition but we

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.540
Caption: know there&#39;s a risk factor there and so

00:17:17.489 --> 00:17:20.219
Caption: that discussion that we&#39;ve been having

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.739
Caption: for a long time around depression and

00:17:20.219 --> 00:17:25.169
Caption: anxiety becomes important right we have

00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:30.569
Caption: a societal issue businesses and

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:32.960
Caption: organizations operate within society so

00:17:30.569 --> 00:17:36.779
Caption: you know what we&#39;re part of the solution

00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:39.059
Caption: we can help will often think that you

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:41.790
Caption: know workplaces are the stressor and

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.710
Caption: they can be you know workplaces are the

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:46.380
Caption: places that give us the anxiety and the

00:17:43.709 --> 00:17:46.589
Caption: depression and sometimes they can be and

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.940
Caption: we

00:17:46.589 --> 00:17:49.500
Caption: to work at it and I&#39;ll talk about that

00:17:47.939 --> 00:17:53.369
Caption: but sometimes they&#39;re a great support

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:55.439
Caption: doing quality work you know being with

00:17:53.369 --> 00:17:57.779
Caption: great peers being with quality people

00:17:55.439 --> 00:17:59.099
Caption: that really know their stuff and that

00:17:57.779 --> 00:18:01.409
Caption: you&#39;re contributing and you know your

00:17:59.099 --> 00:18:03.150
Caption: role and the design of the work that

00:18:01.409 --> 00:18:05.429
Caption: you&#39;re doing is powerfully good what

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.020
Caption: places that can be good as well but this

00:18:05.428 --> 00:18:09.678
Caption: is a societal issue so now let&#39;s bring

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:12.989
Caption: it into the workplace I should note that

00:18:09.678 --> 00:18:16.798
Caption: a lot of the facts and figures here are

00:18:12.989 --> 00:18:19.020
Caption: on reports from PwC instinct and reason

00:18:16.798 --> 00:18:21.089
Caption: TNS social research but all this is on

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.589
Caption: the beyondblue website and all all all

00:18:21.089 --> 00:18:25.760
Caption: the statistics are there for those that

00:18:22.589 --> 00:18:27.719
Caption: want to go into the source material but

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.070
Caption: let&#39;s bring it into a workplace

00:18:27.719 --> 00:18:30.630
Caption: environment with the prevalence that

00:18:29.069 --> 00:18:32.849
Caption: we&#39;ve got in society we know that at any

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:36.808
Caption: given time one in five employees may be

00:18:32.849 --> 00:18:38.819
Caption: being affected by poor mental health we

00:18:36.808 --> 00:18:41.010
Caption: also know there&#39;s a substantive cost to

00:18:38.819 --> 00:18:43.619
Caption: business around about eleven billion

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:47.308
Caption: dollars in Australia most of that&#39;s

00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:49.589
Caption: around absenteeism and presenteeism not

00:18:47.308 --> 00:18:52.709
Caption: so much compensation claims where you

00:18:49.589 --> 00:18:54.719
Caption: might think it is but where are my mind

00:18:52.709 --> 00:18:56.369
Caption: goes again you know from my you know

00:18:54.719 --> 00:18:58.288
Caption: various management roles and all the

00:18:56.369 --> 00:19:00.839
Caption: rest of it is into a couple of figures

00:18:58.288 --> 00:19:02.639
Caption: yes there&#39;s a return on investment an

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:04.199
Caption: average return on investment of $2 30

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.869
Caption: for every dollar invested in effective

00:19:04.199 --> 00:19:10.528
Caption: mental health and well-being programs

00:19:06.869 --> 00:19:12.928
Caption: interventions if you like but and that&#39;s

00:19:10.529 --> 00:19:14.700
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s important that what really

00:19:12.928 --> 00:19:16.319
Caption: stands out for me is the employee

00:19:14.699 --> 00:19:18.028
Caption: engagement and becoming an employer of

00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:19.439
Caption: choice and actually attracting people to

00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:22.309
Caption: your organization because you&#39;re doing

00:19:19.439 --> 00:19:24.808
Caption: good stuff you&#39;ve got a reputation for

00:19:22.308 --> 00:19:27.689
Caption: managing the health and safety of

00:19:24.808 --> 00:19:30.209
Caption: employees from a mental health

00:19:27.689 --> 00:19:32.158
Caption: perspective I don&#39;t know an executive

00:19:30.209 --> 00:19:34.020
Caption: team that doesn&#39;t desire to have greater

00:19:32.159 --> 00:19:35.940
Caption: engagement with their team to drive

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.919
Caption: greater productivity and to drive

00:19:35.939 --> 00:19:40.109
Caption: greater commitment and and and in the

00:19:37.918 --> 00:19:41.449
Caption: end affect the bottom line now sometimes

00:19:40.109 --> 00:19:43.558
Caption: when we talk about a slide like this

00:19:41.449 --> 00:19:47.359
Caption: people go why you&#39;re making about money

00:19:43.558 --> 00:19:50.099
Caption: it&#39;s about saving lives right and it is

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:52.459
Caption: but we also know that businesses and

00:19:50.099 --> 00:19:54.719
Caption: workplaces generally run by bottom line

00:19:52.459 --> 00:19:58.079
Caption: so whether or not you&#39;re actually doing

00:19:54.719 --> 00:20:00.000
Caption: it because as Carolina Carolina

00:19:58.079 --> 00:20:01.289
Caption: mentioned this morning you know

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.699
Caption: you know it&#39;s ethically right it&#39;s the

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.550
Caption: right thing to do to look after our

00:20:02.699 --> 00:20:07.109
Caption: people or actually you know what your

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.910
Caption: financial director you actually need the

00:20:07.109 --> 00:20:11.459
Caption: numbers to back up the investment or

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.599
Caption: actually you&#39;re in HR or in the

00:20:11.459 --> 00:20:15.659
Caption: executive teams and you want greater

00:20:12.599 --> 00:20:17.819
Caption: engagement yeah I don&#39;t really care what

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.349
Caption: drives the action but take action

00:20:17.819 --> 00:20:23.429
Caption: because there&#39;s a business case around

00:20:19.349 --> 00:20:24.959
Caption: it to take action so if we&#39;ve got that

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.460
Caption: understanding of mental health that it&#39;s

00:20:24.959 --> 00:20:28.500
Caption: about all of us then we&#39;ve got this

00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:33.059
Caption: societal issue and we know that it&#39;s a

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:34.140
Caption: business issue we also know that we&#39;re

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.570
Caption: kind of not there yet

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.989
Caption: through various studies we know that

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:43.199
Caption: most employees view a physically safe

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:44.849
Caption: workplace is important and most

00:20:43.199 --> 00:20:47.639
Caption: employees kind of think that their

00:20:44.849 --> 00:20:49.739
Caption: workplaces are physically safe not

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.390
Caption: saying they&#39;re but mostly you know

00:20:49.739 --> 00:20:55.260
Caption: there&#39;s an alignment there even more

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:58.589
Caption: employees value a mentally safe

00:20:55.260 --> 00:21:00.780
Caption: workplace but only half the employee

00:20:58.589 --> 00:21:02.819
Caption: survey viewed their workplaces is

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.680
Caption: mentally safe so we can see the

00:21:02.819 --> 00:21:08.159
Caption: disconnect there between physical and

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:10.020
Caption: mental health and the kind of leap that

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.599
Caption: we&#39;ve got to make to kind of go hey you

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:19.739
Caption: know probably I mean I&#39;m I was born in

00:21:12.599 --> 00:21:22.799
Caption: 68 so I&#39;m 50 I&#39;m 50 I made it but but

00:21:19.739 --> 00:21:25.260
Caption: the net result is back in probably the

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.970
Caption: late 60s early 70s physical health and

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.729
Caption: safety which is getting off the off off

00:21:26.969 --> 00:21:32.579
Caption: the off the ground in terms of systems

00:21:29.729 --> 00:21:34.260
Caption: and processes and governance so really

00:21:32.579 --> 00:21:38.099
Caption: what we&#39;re doing here is making that

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:42.209
Caption: leap to go okay hopefully in how many

00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:45.270
Caption: ever years to 5 10 you don&#39;t need a Marc

00:21:42.209 --> 00:21:46.770
Caption: Leopold or a beyondblue or anyone else

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.000
Caption: up here talking about workplace mental

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.229
Caption: health because it&#39;s about the way we do

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.239
Caption: business because we&#39;ve actually closed

00:21:49.229 --> 00:21:56.369
Caption: that gap but I&#39;d also say that you know

00:21:54.239 --> 00:22:00.929
Caption: there&#39;s absolutely a legit allegis

00:21:56.369 --> 00:22:02.099
Caption: illative and regulatory requirement we

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:04.380
Caption: don&#39;t have a choice

00:22:02.099 --> 00:22:05.969
Caption: by the way the legislation isn&#39;t just

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.940
Caption: about physical health its to keep our

00:22:05.969 --> 00:22:11.819
Caption: people healthy and safe both physically

00:22:08.939 --> 00:22:13.529
Caption: and mentally now I&#39;ll just say with this

00:22:11.819 --> 00:22:13.919
Caption: one that you know what this is critical

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.719
Caption: because

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.550
Caption: it is about compliance but if you&#39;re

00:22:15.719 --> 00:22:18.839
Caption: just doing it as an organization to tick

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.190
Caption: the compliance box I think you&#39;re

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:21.599
Caption: missing an opportunity to have some of

00:22:20.189 --> 00:22:23.279
Caption: those richer relationships that we were

00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:24.719
Caption: talking about some of that authentic

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:29.580
Caption: leadership that will come through in in

00:22:24.719 --> 00:22:32.219
Caption: as I talk on these next slides but I

00:22:29.579 --> 00:22:33.419
Caption: hope in that you know brief period now

00:22:32.219 --> 00:22:36.780
Caption: you&#39;ve got this sort of understanding

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:38.369
Caption: where you go yet a business issue and

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.109
Caption: whatever is driving you whether it&#39;s

00:22:38.369 --> 00:22:44.609
Caption: compliance or financials or engagement

00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:45.689
Caption: we can move forward so how do we go

00:22:44.609 --> 00:22:48.569
Caption: about creating a mentally healthy

00:22:45.689 --> 00:22:50.369
Caption: business well if it was easy again I

00:22:48.569 --> 00:22:53.369
Caption: wouldn&#39;t be here but here&#39;s a few ideas

00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:55.079
Caption: that come to mind this is actually a

00:22:53.369 --> 00:22:56.910
Caption: definition of what a mentally healthy

00:22:55.079 --> 00:22:59.579
Caption: workplace might look like from guarding

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:03.840
Caption: mines in the UK why I like this one is

00:22:59.579 --> 00:23:07.140
Caption: is that that end having energy left over

00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:08.699
Caption: at the end of the day is kind of a nice

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.550
Caption: thing because I know that historically

00:23:08.699 --> 00:23:13.829
Caption: I&#39;ve been in so many roles where

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:15.690
Caption: actually for very long periods if not

00:23:13.829 --> 00:23:18.329
Caption: just my entire working life I was

00:23:15.689 --> 00:23:22.229
Caption: drained I was gone I wasn&#39;t actually

00:23:18.329 --> 00:23:27.029
Caption: going home energised I was going home to

00:23:22.229 --> 00:23:28.169
Caption: recover now again please understand it

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.729
Caption: given I come from a business background

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.710
Caption: I&#39;m not saying that there&#39;s not times

00:23:29.729 --> 00:23:33.569
Caption: when we all work on projects and they go

00:23:31.709 --> 00:23:35.699
Caption: flat out and I&#39;ll certainly know from a

00:23:33.569 --> 00:23:38.789
Caption: software deaf perspective and a tech

00:23:35.699 --> 00:23:40.649
Caption: industry that that occurs right so it&#39;s

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.350
Caption: not about the spikes it&#39;s just about

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:45.000
Caption: saying well actually understanding are

00:23:43.349 --> 00:23:47.849
Caption: we actually creating environments that

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.890
Caption: are energizing our people and I kind of

00:23:47.849 --> 00:23:52.770
Caption: like the idea behind that even if it&#39;s a

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:53.849
Caption: little little bit sort of um you know of

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.979
Caption: a broad framework

00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:57.780
Caption: more specifically we know some

00:23:55.979 --> 00:23:59.429
Caption: attributes of a mentally healthy

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.729
Caption: workplace from those that are doing it

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:05.100
Caption: well and it is about fostering that

00:24:02.729 --> 00:24:09.869
Caption: positive culture playing to people&#39;s

00:24:05.099 --> 00:24:13.589
Caption: strengths managing the risks associated

00:24:09.869 --> 00:24:17.010
Caption: with with the work that we&#39;re doing now

00:24:13.589 --> 00:24:18.510
Caption: clearly I don&#39;t know a FIFO mining

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.739
Caption: environment is going to have very

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.180
Caption: different risks to a professional

00:24:19.739 --> 00:24:24.359
Caption: services firm is going to have different

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.830
Caption: risks to software development in five

00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:27.239
Caption: file might be around you know the

00:24:25.829 --> 00:24:27.630
Caption: disconnection from friends and family

00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:29.910
Caption: and

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:31.530
Caption: away for a long time in professional

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:33.630
Caption: service environments that might be

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:35.400
Caption: around you know continued long hours

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.928
Caption: perfectionism all sorts of different

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.489
Caption: things that start to sort of sit there

00:24:36.928 --> 00:24:40.229
Caption: and go well you know in software

00:24:38.489 --> 00:24:41.699
Caption: development it could be anything and

00:24:40.229 --> 00:24:44.400
Caption: given the breadth of organizations

00:24:41.699 --> 00:24:46.409
Caption: around and and and what I&#39;ve seen you

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:50.609
Caption: know it could be you&#39;re being isolated

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:53.150
Caption: and working alone as you tap away in

00:24:50.609 --> 00:24:55.349
Caption: trying to drive some of that development

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:57.179
Caption: it could be that you&#39;re embedded in

00:24:55.349 --> 00:24:58.949
Caption: teams that are in a toxic environment it

00:24:57.178 --> 00:25:00.209
Caption: could be that your workplace is a toxic

00:24:58.949 --> 00:25:01.099
Caption: environment it could be embedded in

00:25:00.209 --> 00:25:04.619
Caption: teams that are in a great environment

00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:06.058
Caption: but it&#39;s about understanding the risks

00:25:04.619 --> 00:25:07.760
Caption: and helping to mitigate that and I&#39;ll

00:25:06.058 --> 00:25:10.048
Caption: talk about a little bit more about that

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.178
Caption: clearly it&#39;s about supporting people

00:25:10.048 --> 00:25:14.449
Caption: with a mental health condition and I&#39;ll

00:25:12.178 --> 00:25:17.250
Caption: talk a little bit about that as well and

00:25:14.449 --> 00:25:18.928
Caption: then taking a zero-tolerance approach to

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:22.079
Caption: discrimination again Carolina talked

00:25:18.928 --> 00:25:25.500
Caption: about this whole idea around you know

00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:29.279
Caption: inclusive workplaces an inclusive web

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:31.079
Caption: and the fact that DDD you know have this

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.869
Caption: sort of central pillar of diversity

00:25:31.079 --> 00:25:38.010
Caption: inclusion how cool is that right

00:25:32.869 --> 00:25:41.010
Caption: diversity of thought people with a

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:43.650
Caption: mental health condition and anywhere on

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:46.229
Caption: that continuum have great stuff to offer

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:49.710
Caption: and we also know that discrimination has

00:25:46.229 --> 00:25:52.918
Caption: direct links to anxiety depression and

00:25:49.709 --> 00:25:56.099
Caption: worse so zero tolerance to bullying and

00:25:52.918 --> 00:25:57.808
Caption: discrimination and some of the critical

00:25:56.099 --> 00:25:59.339
Caption: success factors that we think about here

00:25:57.808 --> 00:26:00.719
Caption: and none of this should come across as

00:25:59.339 --> 00:26:02.489
Caption: rocket science I hope because I think

00:26:00.719 --> 00:26:04.678
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s predominantly what we do in

00:26:02.489 --> 00:26:06.928
Caption: any good business but what we know again

00:26:04.678 --> 00:26:10.019
Caption: we need leadership commitment to mental

00:26:06.928 --> 00:26:12.058
Caption: health and I&#39;ll talk about that as the

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:15.419
Caption: last point of this slide but we

00:26:12.058 --> 00:26:17.189
Caption: absolutely need to in Courage and have

00:26:15.418 --> 00:26:18.750
Caption: our employees participate in this

00:26:17.189 --> 00:26:21.259
Caption: conversation think about the prevalence

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:23.729
Caption: the TAT stats that I&#39;ve already quoted

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.530
Caption: most of us in this room will have some

00:26:23.729 --> 00:26:27.750
Caption: understanding either directly or

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.780
Caption: indirectly of managing or helping people

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:32.788
Caption: manage a mental health condition

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:37.770
Caption: somewhere on the continuum and therefore

00:26:32.788 --> 00:26:40.019
Caption: there&#39;s a latent kind of desire to

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.040
Caption: actually help this 500 people in this

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.609
Caption: room

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.410
Caption: now interested in this topic and

00:26:43.609 --> 00:26:49.290
Caption: therefore tap into that and also

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:51.210
Caption: understand that it&#39;s an ongoing piece we

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.650
Caption: don&#39;t treat mental health as another and

00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:54.059
Caption: have it as a program or have it as a

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:57.270
Caption: policy we&#39;ve done the policy and it&#39;s

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:59.820
Caption: game over it&#39;s an ongoing communication

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:01.320
Caption: with our organizations just like most of

00:26:59.819 --> 00:27:02.909
Caption: the things that we operate as business

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:04.380
Caption: as usual whether it be broader work

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:07.080
Caption: health safety practices or whatever it

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:10.290
Caption: might be so those three factors are kind

00:27:07.079 --> 00:27:11.939
Caption: of important the leadership commitment

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.470
Caption: one is fundamental because it&#39;s about

00:27:11.939 --> 00:27:15.329
Caption: the time and the allocation of resources

00:27:13.469 --> 00:27:16.919
Caption: and it&#39;s actually about permission to

00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:20.219
Caption: talk and putting in the processes and

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:24.000
Caption: the systems and the supports in place my

00:27:20.219 --> 00:27:26.489
Caption: only reservation sometimes with this is

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.319
Caption: that if you don&#39;t have leadership

00:27:26.489 --> 00:27:32.939
Caption: commitment it doesn&#39;t mean we do nothing

00:27:30.319 --> 00:27:34.529
Caption: because we have roles to play as leaders

00:27:32.939 --> 00:27:38.219
Caption: and influencers to actually drive that

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:40.770
Caption: commitment within our organizations so

00:27:38.219 --> 00:27:43.020
Caption: what can we do to understand and what

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:47.099
Caption: can people in this room do to sort of

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:48.150
Caption: take a a position of influence both you

00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:49.949
Caption: know again we&#39;re talking at the

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:52.080
Caption: workplace but this just bleeds outside

00:27:49.949 --> 00:27:53.669
Caption: of the workplace right but let&#39;s

00:27:52.079 --> 00:27:54.750
Caption: understand what we can do and it is

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.030
Caption: about increasing our understanding

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:59.729
Caption: because as we increase our understanding

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:01.260
Caption: we reduce that fear of actually taking

00:27:59.729 --> 00:28:06.479
Caption: action or having a conversation or

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:08.550
Caption: actually seeking help so you know I

00:28:06.479 --> 00:28:10.859
Caption: implore you to use the heads-up

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:13.770
Caption: resources to at a baseline to improve

00:28:10.859 --> 00:28:15.900
Caption: your understanding of mental health but

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:21.800
Caption: then it&#39;s about using that authentic

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:23.969
Caption: voice you know your own voice the

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.980
Caption: presentations that we&#39;ve got have

00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:28.439
Caption: speaker notes you know beyondblue I just

00:28:25.979 --> 00:28:29.969
Caption: can&#39;t use them because at any given time

00:28:28.439 --> 00:28:33.449
Caption: I&#39;m not quite sure what&#39;s gonna come out

00:28:29.969 --> 00:28:36.469
Caption: I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve done a similar

00:28:33.449 --> 00:28:38.849
Caption: presentation I mean the contents there

00:28:36.469 --> 00:28:40.349
Caption: but it&#39;s about just saying you know what

00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:42.689
Caption: if you&#39;re going to talk about this talk

00:28:40.349 --> 00:28:45.329
Caption: about it in a human way you know as you

00:28:42.689 --> 00:28:47.489
Caption: would other aspects of your life and try

00:28:45.329 --> 00:28:50.159
Caption: and approach it in that manner I&#39;m not

00:28:47.489 --> 00:28:51.660
Caption: saying it&#39;s easy right and in fact I had

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.430
Caption: a great conversation just earlier about

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:56.059
Caption: how hard this is because of our cultural

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:58.559
Caption: norms to almost hide this stuff

00:28:56.058 --> 00:29:00.479
Caption: it&#39;s why it&#39;s a long-term societal

00:28:58.558 --> 00:29:01.829
Caption: change this this isn&#39;t about fixing

00:29:00.479 --> 00:29:05.849
Caption: something overnight it&#39;s about the

00:29:01.829 --> 00:29:07.829
Caption: continued conversation but please look

00:29:05.849 --> 00:29:09.388
Caption: at those elements and think about what

00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:10.918
Caption: you can do as individuals within your

00:29:09.389 --> 00:29:13.979
Caption: workplaces to influence and lead

00:29:10.918 --> 00:29:16.648
Caption: accordingly and of course the basic

00:29:13.979 --> 00:29:19.339
Caption: stuff about also you know recognizing

00:29:16.649 --> 00:29:25.980
Caption: the accomplishments both with ourselves

00:29:19.339 --> 00:29:29.908
Caption: and our teams we don&#39;t have time today

00:29:25.979 --> 00:29:31.139
Caption: to go into a full spectrum of you know

00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:34.039
Caption: how you might apply this in an

00:29:31.139 --> 00:29:36.239
Caption: organizational context on the heads up

00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:37.859
Caption: website there are great resources like

00:29:36.239 --> 00:29:40.199
Caption: this is a how-to guide and how we might

00:29:37.859 --> 00:29:41.639
Caption: apply and start to strategize and plan

00:29:40.199 --> 00:29:43.979
Caption: around workplace mental health they&#39;re

00:29:41.639 --> 00:29:46.710
Caption: free downloads you can get it in digital

00:29:43.979 --> 00:29:48.928
Caption: copy there are limited hard copies to

00:29:46.709 --> 00:29:51.000
Caption: get as well but the net result is you

00:29:48.928 --> 00:29:52.888
Caption: know there&#39;s four steps that we can take

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.380
Caption: to actually implement our strategies in

00:29:52.889 --> 00:29:56.279
Caption: our in our plans and again I hope you&#39;re

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.209
Caption: looking at this going well there&#39;s

00:29:56.279 --> 00:30:00.929
Caption: nothing special about that

00:29:57.209 --> 00:30:03.538
Caption: that&#39;s not relied because it&#39;s not it&#39;s

00:30:00.928 --> 00:30:06.510
Caption: about actually just taking the action to

00:30:03.538 --> 00:30:09.509
Caption: put it into structured systems and

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:12.029
Caption: processes and if you don&#39;t have that

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:13.169
Caption: leadership support how do we gain it and

00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:14.880
Caption: it&#39;s about building the business case

00:30:13.168 --> 00:30:16.768
Caption: that we touched on earlier and and

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.659
Caption: influencing those executives in HR and

00:30:16.769 --> 00:30:20.250
Caption: in finance and doing what we need to do

00:30:18.659 --> 00:30:23.730
Caption: to actually coalesce that team to go

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:25.469
Caption: this is important mm-hmm how do we

00:30:23.729 --> 00:30:26.849
Caption: actually identify the needs a whole

00:30:25.469 --> 00:30:28.079
Caption: range of tools and tips about how we

00:30:26.849 --> 00:30:29.489
Caption: actually look at what we&#39;re doing and I

00:30:28.079 --> 00:30:30.750
Caption: would say most organizations are

00:30:29.489 --> 00:30:33.479
Caption: probably already doing some stuff in

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:35.130
Caption: this and I&#39;ll get to the next slide

00:30:33.479 --> 00:30:37.469
Caption: shortly around how we might do it in a

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:39.569
Caption: more integrated manner but it is around

00:30:37.469 --> 00:30:42.000
Caption: going well what are we doing are we

00:30:39.569 --> 00:30:43.408
Caption: doing anything probably our and and

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.760
Caption: starting to go okay and where are the

00:30:43.409 --> 00:30:49.409
Caption: gaps what aren&#39;t we doing I want to dive

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:50.729
Caption: in to the third point there in terms of

00:30:49.409 --> 00:30:53.730
Caption: developing a plan because the work of

00:30:50.729 --> 00:30:55.260
Caption: Tony LaMontagne and his team shows that

00:30:53.729 --> 00:30:58.589
Caption: really the greatest benefits around

00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:00.419
Caption: workplace mental health get to be taken

00:30:58.589 --> 00:31:02.689
Caption: when we take an integrated approach and

00:31:00.418 --> 00:31:04.918
Caption: that can mean many things to many people

00:31:02.689 --> 00:31:06.599
Caption: because an integrated approach to me

00:31:04.918 --> 00:31:07.768
Caption: also says things like we&#39;ll integrate it

00:31:06.599 --> 00:31:08.640
Caption: within your existing work health safety

00:31:07.769 --> 00:31:11.840
Caption: programs

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:14.119
Caption: your HR programs or whatever might be so

00:31:11.839 --> 00:31:17.130
Caption: integrated in this sense is actually no

00:31:14.119 --> 00:31:19.469
Caption: we absolutely need to support people

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.989
Caption: with a mental health condition so that

00:31:19.469 --> 00:31:24.599
Caption: is a that is a pillar if you like of an

00:31:21.989 --> 00:31:26.309
Caption: integrated approach but let&#39;s also think

00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:28.439
Caption: about promoting the positives of good

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:31.710
Caption: mental health and the positives of good

00:31:28.439 --> 00:31:33.389
Caption: work and let&#39;s also make sure we&#39;re

00:31:31.709 --> 00:31:34.979
Caption: putting in protective factors to ensure

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:36.239
Caption: that we&#39;re keeping the healthy healthy

00:31:34.979 --> 00:31:38.699
Caption: and we&#39;re understanding the risks and

00:31:36.239 --> 00:31:41.609
Caption: we&#39;re mitigating those risks associated

00:31:38.699 --> 00:31:43.739
Caption: with that so yeah absolutely let&#39;s make

00:31:41.609 --> 00:31:46.410
Caption: sure we&#39;re supporting people with a

00:31:43.739 --> 00:31:48.089
Caption: mental health condition but let&#39;s also

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:51.540
Caption: build a holistic view about how we might

00:31:48.089 --> 00:31:53.039
Caption: actually go about getting great benefits

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:56.670
Caption: over time now I guess the the danger

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:59.270
Caption: here and to quote an MD of my past you

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:01.650
Caption: know let&#39;s not boil the ocean

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:03.209
Caption: I&#39;m overwhelming you a little bit with a

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:07.589
Caption: whole range of information here we go

00:32:03.209 --> 00:32:09.270
Caption: what does it mean and there is a desire

00:32:07.589 --> 00:32:10.890
Caption: and the large of the organization gets

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.810
Caption: the bigger it is is almost they want to

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:14.849
Caption: you know do everything at once and have

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:17.610
Caption: the magnificent long plan and strategy

00:32:14.849 --> 00:32:20.130
Caption: but actually you know what that&#39;s

00:32:17.609 --> 00:32:21.929
Caption: something to evolve to start small and

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.729
Caption: iterate you know start with little

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:26.220
Caption: things and then move and see what you

00:32:23.729 --> 00:32:28.739
Caption: learn and then progress I think there&#39;s

00:32:26.219 --> 00:32:30.630
Caption: some you know I&#39;m not a lot a software

00:32:28.739 --> 00:32:32.280
Caption: developer by a mile but I think there&#39;s

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:34.650
Caption: some lessons to work in how we think

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:37.140
Caption: about that sort of agile approach to how

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:40.050
Caption: we take that into how we would you know

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.910
Caption: run our programs around mental health it

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:45.780
Caption: doesn&#39;t need to be the solution at the

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:48.450
Caption: end we can actually work towards it and

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:49.619
Caption: so finally and wrapping up pretty

00:32:48.449 --> 00:32:51.359
Caption: quickly I just want to let you know

00:32:49.619 --> 00:32:54.000
Caption: you&#39;re not working from a blank sheet of

00:32:51.359 --> 00:32:55.829
Caption: paper there are phenomenal free

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.900
Caption: resources that heads up dot org delay

00:32:55.829 --> 00:33:00.510
Caption: you for you to draw upon it is not the

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:01.950
Caption: only source of resources as supported by

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:06.030
Caption: the mentally healthy workplace Alliance

00:33:01.949 --> 00:33:07.559
Caption: but they are great resources as I

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:09.450
Caption: already mentioned there there&#39;s a whole

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.980
Caption: range of information around workplaces

00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:12.689
Caption: but whether you&#39;re a manager whether

00:33:10.979 --> 00:33:14.219
Caption: you&#39;re an employee whether you&#39;re a

00:33:12.689 --> 00:33:15.239
Caption: small business and if I can touch on

00:33:14.219 --> 00:33:16.890
Caption: that for a minute because I imagine

00:33:15.239 --> 00:33:18.630
Caption: there&#39;s some small businesses in the

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:20.369
Caption: room whether your own business you&#39;re a

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:22.410
Caption: consultant or whatever the case is and

00:33:20.369 --> 00:33:24.569
Caption: that is to say that

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:26.220
Caption: some of this is too big you know too too

00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:28.169
Caption: much all at once for a small business

00:33:26.219 --> 00:33:29.459
Caption: and so there&#39;s now new information on

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:31.400
Caption: heads up around how you might approach

00:33:29.459 --> 00:33:33.719
Caption: it from a small business perspective and

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.219
Caption: really you know a lot that&#39;s coming out

00:33:33.719 --> 00:33:36.780
Caption: and beyondblue do it does a lot of work

00:33:35.219 --> 00:33:41.189
Caption: with stakeholders to try and figure out

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:43.680
Caption: you know how we can better serve our our

00:33:41.189 --> 00:33:46.109
Caption: end customers to you know the Australian

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.280
Caption: public but small businesses are telling

00:33:46.109 --> 00:33:48.689
Caption: us they want it through the channels

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.160
Caption: they get so they want to you know if

00:33:48.689 --> 00:33:51.709
Caption: they&#39;ve got a trusted advisor from a

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.540
Caption: bookkeeper to an accountant then let&#39;s

00:33:51.709 --> 00:33:56.130
Caption: let&#39;s use that channel you know it&#39;s

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.960
Caption: about how do we look after ourselves as

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:59.790
Caption: small business owners and I sort of

00:33:57.959 --> 00:34:01.229
Caption: equate this not beyondblue term my term

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:03.510
Caption: around you know when you you get the

00:34:01.229 --> 00:34:05.040
Caption: safety thing from an airplane and and it

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.329
Caption: says look after yourself before you look

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.398
Caption: after your kids you know sort of put on

00:34:06.329 --> 00:34:09.928
Caption: the mask I think there&#39;s a bit of an

00:34:08.398 --> 00:34:12.030
Caption: analogy there with small business to

00:34:09.928 --> 00:34:13.648
Caption: because you actually need to look after

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:17.129
Caption: yourself because if you fall over as a

00:34:13.648 --> 00:34:18.719
Caption: small business owner the impacts are

00:34:17.128 --> 00:34:21.750
Caption: greater and so are the greater if you

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:23.219
Caption: remain mentally healthy so just be aware

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:24.898
Caption: that there&#39;s a whole heap of great

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:26.699
Caption: resources that are available I&#39;ve

00:34:24.898 --> 00:34:29.189
Caption: highlighted some I&#39;ve already talked

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:31.560
Caption: about the the guide to workplace mental

00:34:29.189 --> 00:34:32.819
Caption: health but I guess a couple of things

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.889
Caption: that have come from conversations

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:38.610
Caption: tonight last night and even in the

00:34:34.888 --> 00:34:41.309
Caption: audience today which is around making

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:43.080
Caption: sure that we as individuals in whatever

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:44.310
Caption: role we&#39;re playing in an organization

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.530
Caption: we&#39;re looking after our own mental

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:49.530
Caption: health and there&#39;s lots of tips and

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:51.719
Caption: tools around that around how we might

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:53.489
Caption: think about iEARN mental health has even

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:55.590
Caption: things around war actually should we

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:57.360
Caption: have the conversation in a workplace I&#39;m

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:59.010
Caption: not advocating that you actually can in

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.550
Caption: all because some workplaces just aren&#39;t

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:04.560
Caption: ready for it right but in the context of

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.060
Caption: it if that&#39;s not the case who are we

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.860
Caption: speaking to what are you doing to look

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.900
Caption: after yourself who are the supports that

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.820
Caption: you can go to and if they&#39;re not friends

00:35:09.899 --> 00:35:13.439
Caption: and family as an initial part is it

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.390
Caption: calling the beyondblue line you know the

00:35:13.439 --> 00:35:18.149
Caption: 24-hour support service or is it going

00:35:15.389 --> 00:35:19.260
Caption: online to the beyondblue forums you

00:35:18.149 --> 00:35:22.109
Caption: understand how we can look after

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:24.540
Caption: ourselves and importantly how we support

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:27.360
Caption: others do you have a conversation about

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:31.050
Caption: work if you see that mark leopold is you

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:32.400
Caption: know sadly in in work I think that we

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:33.719
Caption: kind of know each other better and we

00:35:32.399 --> 00:35:35.919
Caption: know our family sometimes because we

00:35:33.719 --> 00:35:38.649
Caption: work so closely together for such

00:35:35.919 --> 00:35:40.659
Caption: get periods of time so what happens if

00:35:38.649 --> 00:35:42.189
Caption: you start to start to see some of the

00:35:40.659 --> 00:35:44.530
Caption: signs and symptoms and hey Mark you know

00:35:42.189 --> 00:35:46.449
Caption: it&#39;s not about saying that you look you

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:47.949
Caption: know depressed go take a concrete pill

00:35:46.449 --> 00:35:49.868
Caption: or let&#39;s go for a drink all that self

00:35:47.949 --> 00:35:51.368
Caption: medicate or let&#39;s do whatever it&#39;s not

00:35:49.868 --> 00:35:53.618
Caption: about diagnosing them it&#39;s kind of

00:35:51.368 --> 00:35:56.469
Caption: recognizing that your colleague or your

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:58.058
Caption: friend or your family member the

00:35:56.469 --> 00:36:00.760
Caption: behaviors have changed and hey Mark I&#39;ve

00:35:58.059 --> 00:36:02.200
Caption: noticed you&#39;re not going out much

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.939
Caption: anymore I&#39;ve noticed you&#39;re not this so

00:36:02.199 --> 00:36:05.588
Caption: you know it&#39;s not that is there anything

00:36:03.939 --> 00:36:07.000
Caption: I can do you know you want to talk about

00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:12.270
Caption: anything you know what&#39;s interesting

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:16.209
Caption: about that is that after I had my own I

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:17.799
Caption: guess experience with depression I got

00:36:16.209 --> 00:36:19.389
Caption: back in I was managing people and some

00:36:17.799 --> 00:36:21.520
Caption: of the basic things that I did you know

00:36:19.389 --> 00:36:22.689
Caption: I used to say someone come up to me and

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.489
Caption: say hey Mark you know like I&#39;m not

00:36:22.689 --> 00:36:24.939
Caption: feeling so good night and said hey we&#39;re

00:36:24.489 --> 00:36:26.169
Caption: a team

00:36:24.939 --> 00:36:28.838
Caption: you just go ahead and do what you need

00:36:26.169 --> 00:36:31.868
Caption: to do cool don&#39;t you worry about it

00:36:28.839 --> 00:36:35.200
Caption: don&#39;t worry about work we&#39;ll we&#39;ll work

00:36:31.868 --> 00:36:36.669
Caption: it out I then sort of thought about my

00:36:35.199 --> 00:36:38.379
Caption: own situation and again everyone&#39;s

00:36:36.669 --> 00:36:39.548
Caption: different because that is actually kind

00:36:38.379 --> 00:36:41.709
Caption: of a viable thing there&#39;s nothing wrong

00:36:39.549 --> 00:36:43.180
Caption: with what I&#39;ve said there but then I

00:36:41.709 --> 00:36:44.318
Caption: changed and I&#39;m more likely to say yeah

00:36:43.179 --> 00:36:49.209
Caption: look sure is there anything you want to

00:36:44.319 --> 00:36:50.829
Caption: talk about try and act explore you know

00:36:49.209 --> 00:36:52.118
Caption: what was what was there and you know

00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:56.229
Caption: what was interesting and again it&#39;s

00:36:52.118 --> 00:36:57.818
Caption: wrong to make generalizations the blokes

00:36:56.229 --> 00:37:03.429
Caption: generally don&#39;t talk and so they&#39;ve been

00:36:57.819 --> 00:37:04.780
Caption: arts are okay off we go but then the

00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:06.219
Caption: more I asked that question the more

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:09.309
Caption: maybe a day later or a week later

00:37:06.219 --> 00:37:10.479
Caption: sometimes months later a mark you know

00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:15.099
Caption: asked if there was something I want to

00:37:10.479 --> 00:37:17.169
Caption: talk about can we have a chat and that

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:19.000
Caption: small change leads to people actually

00:37:17.169 --> 00:37:20.379
Caption: opening up and at that point I&#39;m no

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.849
Caption: expert right again I&#39;m not a counselor

00:37:20.379 --> 00:37:24.639
Caption: I&#39;m not a psychologist but I&#39;ve got

00:37:21.849 --> 00:37:27.040
Caption: someone that has taken the effort and

00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:29.078
Caption: the trust to have a conversation with me

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.119
Caption: and what wonderful so now it&#39;s about

00:37:29.079 --> 00:37:32.890
Caption: opening up the ears and then saying hey

00:37:31.118 --> 00:37:35.169
Caption: listen you know have you thought about

00:37:32.889 --> 00:37:36.669
Caption: getting help have you seen your GP have

00:37:35.169 --> 00:37:39.489
Caption: you spoken to the asipi I looked at that

00:37:36.669 --> 00:37:40.868
Caption: and guiding people to that help so look

00:37:39.489 --> 00:37:42.699
Caption: there&#39;s a whole heap of information

00:37:40.868 --> 00:37:43.959
Caption: there around how to support others and I

00:37:42.699 --> 00:37:45.848
Caption: want to sort of finish as well in terms

00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:49.118
Caption: of saying that there&#39;s some great

00:37:45.849 --> 00:37:49.900
Caption: resources in online learning stuff where

00:37:49.118 --> 00:37:52.089
Caption: you can do sort of

00:37:49.899 --> 00:37:53.229
Caption: 20 minute roll plays around how you

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:54.910
Caption: would actually approach someone in the

00:37:53.229 --> 00:37:58.750
Caption: workplace how you would have the

00:37:54.909 --> 00:38:00.369
Caption: conversation know how you would manage

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:03.909
Caption: risks in the workplace now some of these

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:05.500
Caption: and again what&#39;s called SCORM compliance

00:38:03.909 --> 00:38:06.699
Caption: so that can be dragged and dropped for

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:08.409
Caption: lack of a better word into your own

00:38:06.699 --> 00:38:10.929
Caption: learning management systems and and then

00:38:08.409 --> 00:38:12.849
Caption: you&#39;ve got sort of a measurable and and

00:38:10.929 --> 00:38:14.770
Caption: and a way to see who&#39;s doing the

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:16.120
Caption: training within your organization&#39;s but

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.860
Caption: others are just there on the beyondblue

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.510
Caption: website and they&#39;re there to you so use

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:21.730
Caption: them and that&#39;s what I meant about

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:23.139
Caption: workplaces without leadership commitment

00:38:21.729 --> 00:38:25.149
Caption: and if that&#39;s not the case that&#39;s cool

00:38:23.139 --> 00:38:26.739
Caption: but you can at least with you and your

00:38:25.149 --> 00:38:30.939
Caption: team start the conversation on some

00:38:26.739 --> 00:38:34.060
Caption: pretty cool free resources as well and

00:38:30.939 --> 00:38:36.129
Caption: so to close I guess I just say look you

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:38.320
Caption: know if you can&#39;t think about it in this

00:38:36.129 --> 00:38:40.839
Caption: way and aligned with border broader

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:43.690
Caption: workplace initiatives fine there is no

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:45.790
Caption: one right way so don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re

00:38:43.689 --> 00:38:47.379
Caption: actually gonna sit there and go make a

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.660
Caption: mistake I think if you&#39;re taking action

00:38:47.379 --> 00:38:51.639
Caption: an action that&#39;s based on you know some

00:38:49.659 --> 00:38:52.959
Caption: credible and evidence-based materials

00:38:51.639 --> 00:38:55.029
Caption: you&#39;re a step ahead

00:38:52.959 --> 00:38:56.830
Caption: it says integrate with broader work

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:58.120
Caption: health safety systems do that but

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.620
Caption: sometimes you might actually have to

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.330
Caption: treat it as a separate project to start

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.640
Caption: with just to get your head around it as

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:08.020
Caption: an organization there is no one right

00:39:03.639 --> 00:39:10.389
Caption: way it isn&#39;t a program we don&#39;t do

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:13.030
Caption: something we don&#39;t do heads up we don&#39;t

00:39:10.389 --> 00:39:16.089
Caption: do I think and we push the button and

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:17.800
Caption: mental health is fixed No think about it

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:19.540
Caption: as that process and system that is

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:22.209
Caption: ongoing the way we do business the way

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:23.530
Caption: we run our businesses and I think I&#39;ll

00:39:22.209 --> 00:39:27.219
Caption: finish in saying you know that what I

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:29.140
Caption: said before that if you can start small

00:39:27.219 --> 00:39:30.939
Caption: start small with grow and that might be

00:39:29.139 --> 00:39:33.909
Caption: getting a volunteer speaker in and

00:39:30.939 --> 00:39:35.589
Caption: talking about it a brown-bag it might be

00:39:33.909 --> 00:39:38.679
Caption: actually just letting people know that

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:40.479
Caption: there&#39;s resources available wherever it

00:39:38.679 --> 00:39:44.229
Caption: is start small and grow from there and I

00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:47.639
Caption: think that by taking action you as both

00:39:44.229 --> 00:39:51.760
Caption: individuals and organizations in a

00:39:47.639 --> 00:39:54.399
Caption: phenomenal industry hopefully start I

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.199
Caption: guess support some changes across

00:39:54.399 --> 00:39:57.849
Caption: broader society that we really need so

00:39:56.199 --> 00:40:00.250
Caption: look I don&#39;t know what you expected but

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:02.020
