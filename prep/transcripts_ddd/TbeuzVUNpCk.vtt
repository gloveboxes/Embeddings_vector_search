Caption: all the rest but anyway yes that is a

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:45.979
Caption: bigger picture of me wearing a bigger

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:50.128
Caption: half

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:51.599
Caption: why you might ask good question yeah

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.840
Caption: that&#39;s what&#39;s going through your minds

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:57.479
Caption: right it&#39;s happening well yes it&#39;s

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.939
Caption: because I am a person who wears a lot of

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.328
Caption: hats for those who know me in the room

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:02.729
Caption: already

00:01:00.328 --> 00:01:05.639
Caption: there&#39;s a lot going along going on in my

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:08.669
Caption: life ah by day I go run a digital agency

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:11.369
Caption: I&#39;m also part of conference organizing

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:14.658
Caption: teams have organized meetups national

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.009
Caption: road shows things and stuff and that and

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:19.199
Caption: that seems like a fair bit because

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.700
Caption: usually I would be doing that all at one

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:23.250
Caption: time

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:26.339
Caption: thus the multiple hats so I do get off

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.650
Caption: often ask the question how do you find

00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:31.228
Caption: the time how do you find the energy to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.860
Caption: do all of these things and it&#39;s a great

00:01:31.228 --> 00:01:37.289
Caption: question but pretty much it&#39;s just going

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.349
Caption: about and you know finding the right

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.110
Caption: balance to have the energy and the time

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:48.149
Caption: to get done and I say and I say

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.250
Caption:  it&#39;s too late I&#39;ve done it okay but

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.810
Caption: really more importantly it&#39;s you know

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.569
Caption: about the productivity side of it

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:56.908
Caption: looking at maximizing your time for full

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.849
Caption: productivity but not burning out because

00:01:56.908 --> 00:02:01.860
Caption: we&#39;re all at risk of it because we&#39;re in

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.199
Caption: this great industry and we love it right

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.949
Caption: sorry we&#39;re doing a 95 if that&#39;s what

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:06.468
Caption: we&#39;re doing

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:08.369
Caption: and then we&#39;re going home and probably

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.520
Caption: smashing out the laptops on the couch

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.980
Caption: again doing weekend hacks

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.020
Caption: is because we love it but where&#39;s the

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:21.879
Caption: end to it you know we&#39;re connected 24/7

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:23.779
Caption: and you know how am i doing it yeah

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.770
Caption: everyone&#39;s gonna have it stuck in their

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.779
Caption: head maybe later

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.380
Caption: I want to strike I&#39;m gonna do this I&#39;m

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:34.009
Caption: just gonna get it out of my system all

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.680
Caption: right I actually wasn&#39;t born with time

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:40.580
Caption: management skills or you know knowledge

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:42.769
Caption: on how to balance my work life and all

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.199
Caption: the things I&#39;ve been up to it&#39;s been

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.910
Caption: through training really good habits into

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:50.209
Caption: place and it&#39;s a bit of trial and error

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.029
Caption: as well and it comes down to balancing

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.860
Caption: and balancing means that you do need to

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.899
Caption: make some careful decisions about how

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.669
Caption: you actually distribute your time and

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:02.149
Caption: what you say yes to and what you say no

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:04.099
Caption: to sorry okay it got me thinking too you

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:07.189
Caption: know the work hard rest and recover

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.590
Caption: mentality that athletes have or anyone

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.760
Caption: with a profession that requires physical

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:16.819
Caption: ability to perform their job role sorry

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:19.220
Caption: you know someone who who is in that kind

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.350
Caption: of role they do need to continue the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.000
Caption: pace though they need to be able to

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.440
Caption: perform at it peak near their peak level

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.320
Caption: at all times to be at a function in

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.619
Caption: their job role and we kind of we kind of

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.360
Caption: do the same here but without a mind as

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:38.479
Caption: our tool that&#39;s our you know that&#39;s our

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.800
Caption: mind muscle and in you know in the

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.080
Caption: athlete world I&#39;m pretty interested in

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.979
Caption: fitness myself

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.070
Caption: there is actually thing called

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:48.379
Caption: overtraining syndrome OTS as it&#39;s

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.350
Caption: commonly referred to and it&#39;s not too

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.080
Caption: dissimilar to our where compare it to

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.230
Caption: burning out in industry it&#39;s the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.770
Caption: definition of it is this but it&#39;s

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:03.319
Caption: literally the the misbalance of breast

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.680
Caption: and actually doing things so resting

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.530
Caption: training which leads to the physical

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:11.719
Caption: detriment of that athlete or that you

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:13.970
Caption: know whatever that profession might be

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.279
Caption: they kind of imagine when an athlete is

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.480
Caption: injured well they&#39;ll get fetched and

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.760
Caption: they&#39;ll recover and they&#39;ll get that

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.859
Caption: chance to you know gain their energy

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.688
Caption: back but

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.199
Caption: is it different is it so different to

00:04:23.688 --> 00:04:29.000
Caption: the mind you know what about what if our

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.580
Caption: minds need that breath in that moment to

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.639
Caption: recharge our energy bar as well so this

00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:37.069
Caption: this myth that I find you know that mind

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.750
Caption: is not as important as the body when

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.688
Caption: we&#39;re looking after you know looking

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.889
Caption: after our well being who emerge you to

00:04:41.688 --> 00:04:46.908
Caption: that not even a 3d one yet sorry I&#39;m

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.149
Caption: saying that yeah

00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:51.139
Caption: our minds are you know our our during

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:52.938
Caption: the hard work they&#39;re doing the heavy

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.158
Caption: lifting because in our profession we

00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:57.408
Caption: need to be borrowing and solving

00:04:55.158 --> 00:04:59.899
Caption: problems and just being fresh and at it

00:04:57.408 --> 00:05:01.339
Caption: and you know being creative and all the

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:03.259
Caption: things that are expected of us and we&#39;re

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:06.709
Caption: constantly learning and it&#39;s taking a

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:09.739
Caption: lot of energy or yes I&#39;m saying that

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:11.089
Caption: we&#39;re mind athletes mm-hmm yeah we have

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:13.908
Caption: to look after these little organs of

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:15.589
Caption: ours because we need them to do our

00:05:13.908 --> 00:05:17.929
Caption: day-to-day is that we need them for our

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:20.259
Caption: careers and this is the industry that

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:20.259
Caption: we&#39;re in

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:29.119
Caption: but it&#39;s not as simple right to measure

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.500
Caption: how we&#39;re tracking with that like I

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:33.049
Caption: mentioned with someone with a physical

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.239
Caption: profession look if you if you&#39;re tired

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:38.259
Caption: or you&#39;re you know you&#39;ve injured

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:41.359
Caption: something you you know oh my arms broken

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.600
Caption: better stop yeah you don&#39;t really have

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:46.219
Caption: so much of the same cues you know when

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.320
Caption: you when when you&#39;re kind of dealing

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.149
Caption: with how tied your mind might go because

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.070
Caption: we&#39;re always pushing through we&#39;re

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:54.440
Caption: always just you know just keep going

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.480
Caption: just keep going until that bug solved oh

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.950
Caption: you know like let&#39;s just skip lunch and

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.050
Caption: just work through let&#39;s do an

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.730
Caption: all-nighter do what we need to do but we

00:06:00.049 --> 00:06:04.099
Caption: can&#39;t really tell where that line of

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.940
Caption: burnout is coming up I know I&#39;ve got

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.290
Caption: programs but not you know we don&#39;t have

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.100
Caption: our moral qualms about little Powerbars

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.380
Caption: above our heads

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.820
Caption: tell us when that&#39;s whittling down and

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.570
Caption: we&#39;re getting to a point where we need

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.730
Caption: to recharge again sorry we really have

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.460
Caption: to take this opportunity to be more

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.320
Caption: proactive and it does take discipline it

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:27.679
Caption: does take a bit of you know change in

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.869
Caption: that mindset but it&#39;s for you know it&#39;s

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:32.989
Caption: for the long game it&#39;s so that you can

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:34.250
Caption: continue to race through and do the

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:36.380
Caption: things that you need to do at sprint

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.790
Caption: pace as well as you know a jogging pace

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.610
Caption: as well it&#39;s walking pace as well as

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:43.040
Caption: sitting pace when you need to sorry time

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:46.189
Caption: to be proactive there&#39;s I guess if you

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.320
Caption: you know a few scenarios that I&#39;ve come

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.330
Caption: across and hopefully they&#39;ll be or some

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.770
Caption: of them will be coming to you all but

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:53.839
Caption: you know if we can just cut through some

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:55.759
Caption: of those with some actions of what is it

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:57.799
Caption: that we actually want to do to be able

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.390
Caption: to maximize our productivity again

00:06:57.799 --> 00:07:02.539
Caption: remembering that we don&#39;t want to burn

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:05.480
Caption: out I think there&#39;s three things as part

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.440
Caption: of the formula was productivity and

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:12.020
Caption: getting done one is improving focus

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.660
Caption: who is increasing energy and three is

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:16.669
Caption: keeping motivated now each of those will

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.100
Caption: have their you know their tools and

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.320
Caption: whatnot that you you can put towards

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.850
Caption: actually recharging those areas but I

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.010
Caption: suppose I would just apply in a

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.770
Caption: practical sense with some scenarios that

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:30.290
Caption: we might be in though featuring at these

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:32.989
Caption: moments and Pat&#39;s isms I may be knowing

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.980
Caption: to just make up terms and words you know

00:07:32.989 --> 00:07:34.940
Caption: it&#39;s fine

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.240
Caption: hoping that they&#39;re going to go

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.919
Caption: mainstream so

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:44.619
Caption: yeah maybe somewhat they still catch on

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:47.500
Caption: so what do you think of get grant

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:49.949
Caption: deadlines everyday forever always in the

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.059
Caption: grill it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s always the way and

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:54.220
Caption: seemingly sometimes when you&#39;re just

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:56.669
Caption: going and going and going where&#39;s the

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.669
Caption: end of it

00:07:56.739 --> 00:08:01.389
Caption: there&#39;s always going to be a deadline

00:07:58.709 --> 00:08:02.679
Caption: honestly on it there&#39;s there&#39;s just no

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.820
Caption: getting out of it in the industry that

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:06.309
Caption: we&#39;re in there&#39;s always something to be

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.440
Caption: working towards and as soon as you hit

00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:11.079
Caption: one milestone you&#39;re going to be doing

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:14.019
Caption: the next projects right sorry

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:15.909
Caption: a good balance ideally here are some

00:08:14.019 --> 00:08:17.709
Caption: suggestions of just resting and

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.619
Caption: recovering and getting those energy

00:08:17.709 --> 00:08:22.959
Caption: surpluses back up again and I know it

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:25.029
Caption: sounds super simple but a lot of people

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:28.539
Caption: don&#39;t do it I was guilty of this for

00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:31.200
Caption: ages until I actually had to program it

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:35.380
Caption: in as part of a process or a project

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:39.040
Caption: taking a pause and taking a break downs

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:40.869
Caption: wild groundbreaking but actually

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:42.489
Caption: celebrating your wins at the end of

00:08:40.869 --> 00:08:44.830
Caption: hitting a milestone and that&#39;s not just

00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:46.809
Caption: as an individual but it&#39;s also being

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.000
Caption: part of a team right you want to be able

00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:52.179
Caption: to give your co-workers as well a pat on

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.070
Caption: the back and say we did this right let&#39;s

00:08:52.179 --> 00:08:56.380
Caption: reflect let&#39;s have a look to see where

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.910
Caption: we&#39;re at on the roadmap you can also as

00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.039
Caption: an individual take that chance to

00:08:57.909 --> 00:09:02.319
Caption: reflect by getting that quiet time to

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:04.570
Caption: just think okay where is that sitting

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.020
Caption: with what I learned and what my career

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:09.640
Caption: roadmap looks like not enough people do

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.739
Caption: this at the end of milestones because

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.420
Caption: it&#39;s always something else going on but

00:09:11.739 --> 00:09:16.080
Caption: like I mentioned it&#39;s really it&#39;s really

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:18.609
Caption: just about building it in as a habit and

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.900
Caption: it&#39;s as some you know home you know I&#39;ve

00:09:18.609 --> 00:09:21.429
Caption: got these deadlines coming up next we

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.619
Caption: could do organize yep

00:09:21.429 --> 00:09:26.710
Caption: that stuff happens all the time it&#39;s

00:09:23.619 --> 00:09:28.779
Caption: it&#39;s normal taking leave is not slacking

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:31.480
Caption: off you&#39;re entitled to it you leave if

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:34.060
Caption: you have timing loo banked up

00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:35.739
Caption: take it rather than banking banking it

00:09:34.059 --> 00:09:37.090
Caption: up because you know there&#39;s going to be

00:09:35.739 --> 00:09:38.320
Caption: a point where it&#39;s just got all going to

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.330
Caption: hit an end and you&#39;re going to think

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.789
Caption: I&#39;ve been doing this for ten years

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:47.119
Caption: straight and better take that break

00:09:43.789 --> 00:09:47.750
Caption: so in doing all of that a motivations

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:49.640
Caption: restored

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.320
Caption: we&#39;re reenergized and we&#39;re ready to

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:55.359
Caption: focus again though thinking of that

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.359
Caption: energy bar that&#39;s building up yeah

00:09:56.599 --> 00:10:02.729
Caption: let&#39;s say these always happy so really

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:05.189
Caption: this is when you just so tired you

00:10:02.729 --> 00:10:07.588
Caption: you&#39;re actually mentally and probably

00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:10.350
Caption: physically exhausted too and a naps just

00:10:07.588 --> 00:10:11.938
Caption: not going to cut it or you know I mean I

00:10:10.349 --> 00:10:15.479
Caption: did have a nap pod under my desk for a

00:10:11.939 --> 00:10:17.970
Caption: while and that kind of helped but it&#39;s

00:10:15.479 --> 00:10:19.498
Caption: you know it what it kind of contributes

00:10:17.969 --> 00:10:22.169
Caption: to is things like you start getting

00:10:19.499 --> 00:10:24.360
Caption: glasses and your focus you know you say

00:10:22.169 --> 00:10:25.859
Caption: is there times where you&#39;ve just been

00:10:24.359 --> 00:10:27.838
Caption: staring at your screen you just trying

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:29.219
Caption: to push through it and imagine you you

00:10:27.838 --> 00:10:32.429
Caption: know you there for three hours four

00:10:29.219 --> 00:10:35.669
Caption: hours like me like oh oh that little

00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:37.648
Caption: thing but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s normal

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:40.138
Caption: because we&#39;ve lost focus with you know

00:10:37.648 --> 00:10:42.568
Caption: you can&#39;t quite see it clearly at that

00:10:40.138 --> 00:10:45.678
Caption: point because your mind is exhausted and

00:10:42.568 --> 00:10:48.928
Caption: so that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a cue for you

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:52.139
Caption: sometimes you get to this extreme and if

00:10:48.929 --> 00:10:54.179
Caption: burnout we&#39;re to have a face it&#39;s pretty

00:10:52.138 --> 00:10:56.518
Caption: thing I think nothing against cats but

00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:59.759
Caption: that ones are really my feral one yeah

00:10:56.518 --> 00:11:01.828
Caption: if you get to this point where you are

00:10:59.758 --> 00:11:03.719
Caption: you know that you need you know you

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:08.489
Caption: break all you just you&#39;re just going to

00:11:03.719 --> 00:11:10.378
Caption: crash then right like I guess Ryan got

00:11:08.489 --> 00:11:12.808
Caption: to get to that point is ideal but either

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:14.610
Caption: which way it&#39;s about refueling you&#39;re at

00:11:12.809 --> 00:11:16.410
Caption: a point where you&#39;ve just reached a

00:11:14.609 --> 00:11:18.508
Caption: limit you&#39;ve worked yourself so hard and

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:19.979
Caption: will do that I&#39;m saying that and this is

00:11:18.508 --> 00:11:22.138
Caption: this is what we do in our industry and

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:23.789
Caption: we just you know you&#39;re just warming

00:11:22.138 --> 00:11:27.508
Caption: those good habits to give you a chair

00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:28.618
Caption: yourself that chance to give your mind

00:11:27.508 --> 00:11:31.229
Caption: and body a rest

00:11:28.619 --> 00:11:33.838
Caption: so again programming that in or

00:11:31.229 --> 00:11:36.448
Caption: designing that in into your day really

00:11:33.838 --> 00:11:39.359
Caption: simple stuff yeah Gelinas the script the

00:11:36.448 --> 00:11:40.859
Caption: stretch breaks at them we&#39;ve got to

00:11:39.359 --> 00:11:43.678
Caption: stretch but breaks that happen daily

00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:45.299
Caption: we&#39;re cured up with an automatic song

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:47.790
Caption: that happens at a certain amount a

00:11:45.299 --> 00:11:50.278
Caption: certain time each day and everyone gets

00:11:47.789 --> 00:11:53.128
Caption: up and does a little stretch it&#39;s not

00:11:50.278 --> 00:11:55.679
Caption: just you know like a physical you know

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:57.509
Caption: it&#39;s helping with our RS on our back

00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:59.819
Caption: problems because that&#39;s property but

00:11:57.508 --> 00:12:01.469
Caption: more sorry I suppose what I mean by this

00:11:59.818 --> 00:12:03.298
Caption: is taking a chance to just take a break

00:12:01.469 --> 00:12:06.688
Caption: it&#39;s scheduled in so you&#39;re prioritizing

00:12:03.299 --> 00:12:08.088
Caption: it and you&#39;re giving your you know your

00:12:06.689 --> 00:12:10.689
Caption: mind a break from that task

00:12:08.088 --> 00:12:14.299
Caption: and resting your eyes and you know just

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:15.889
Caption: taking that moment to just deep breath

00:12:14.299 --> 00:12:17.179
Caption: and that&#39;s okay

00:12:15.888 --> 00:12:19.609
Caption: it just has to be a five-minute break

00:12:17.179 --> 00:12:20.979
Caption: you know get a drink of water or a tea

00:12:19.609 --> 00:12:25.219
Caption: just go for a little walk

00:12:20.979 --> 00:12:26.958
Caption: heading sleep it&#39;s obviously I&#39;m going

00:12:25.219 --> 00:12:29.508
Caption: to be a little bit of it this one I&#39;m a

00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:31.549
Caption: bit of a hypocrite um there was a time

00:12:29.508 --> 00:12:33.138
Caption: where always having leaving off four

00:12:31.549 --> 00:12:35.808
Caption: hours of sleep night and that was

00:12:33.138 --> 00:12:37.099
Caption: perfectly all good and I had you know I

00:12:35.809 --> 00:12:38.749
Caption: felt like I had a really good balance

00:12:37.099 --> 00:12:41.808
Caption: and I was getting you know I was getting

00:12:38.749 --> 00:12:43.519
Caption: lots done but it was just kind of we

00:12:41.809 --> 00:12:46.069
Caption: doing away at my little pantry of energy

00:12:43.518 --> 00:12:49.188
Caption: so that was diminishing diminishing

00:12:46.068 --> 00:12:51.318
Caption: diminishing and then I just add one day

00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:53.540
Caption: like a 20-hour sleep and it&#39;s probably

00:12:51.318 --> 00:12:55.669
Caption: not ideal right I was probably just

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:58.039
Caption: working my body in my mind a bit too

00:12:55.669 --> 00:13:00.438
Caption: hard and how was I even supposed to get

00:12:58.039 --> 00:13:02.768
Caption: anything done sorry

00:13:00.439 --> 00:13:05.870
Caption: better habits again we&#39;re working on it

00:13:02.768 --> 00:13:07.128
Caption: avoiding hangry chewed I get the

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:09.318
Caption: hungary&#39;s like there&#39;s no tomorrow

00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:12.439
Caption: and not being out of focus on a task

00:13:09.318 --> 00:13:15.018
Caption: while you&#39;re hungry right now I&#39;m sorry

00:13:12.439 --> 00:13:17.059
Caption: I&#39;m keeping you from lunch but sometimes

00:13:15.018 --> 00:13:20.299
Caption: it just makes it you know older all the

00:13:17.059 --> 00:13:22.278
Caption: way harder and at that moment I&#39;m saying

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:24.409
Caption: let&#39;s be proactive let&#39;s have our

00:13:22.278 --> 00:13:26.059
Caption: breakfast to fill us up so that our

00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:28.099
Caption: bodies have something to burn off to

00:13:26.059 --> 00:13:30.589
Caption: create energy to create mind power mind

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:32.928
Caption: athletes Milligan&#39;s know that makes

00:13:30.588 --> 00:13:34.549
Caption: sense but I&#39;m actually doing it putting

00:13:32.929 --> 00:13:37.429
Caption: it to practice and making it a priority

00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:41.268
Caption: is your choice and completely up to you

00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:43.970
Caption: I think it&#39;s a good sorry

00:13:41.268 --> 00:13:46.188
Caption: taking lead again that&#39;s um that&#39;s a

00:13:43.969 --> 00:13:48.378
Caption: massive one just I don&#39;t feel like a lot

00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:50.389
Caption: of people taking off breaks and because

00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:52.550
Caption: they just keep on going but the works

00:13:50.388 --> 00:13:54.078
Caption: always going to be there I promise you

00:13:52.549 --> 00:13:56.239
Caption: it&#39;s always gonna be that when you get

00:13:54.078 --> 00:13:58.508
Caption: back so there we go

00:13:56.239 --> 00:14:00.438
Caption: what we&#39;re doing there is again just

00:13:58.508 --> 00:14:03.258
Caption: refueling ourselves getting our energy

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:06.100
Caption: bar you know right up there which

00:14:03.258 --> 00:14:09.639

Caption: or the one that&#39;s going to be carried on

00:14:11.169 --> 00:14:18.429
Caption: up to you and all of this is us while

00:14:15.909 --> 00:14:22.359
Caption: working towards avoiding shiny Bri a

00:14:18.429 --> 00:14:25.989
Caption:  like this one and you know this is

00:14:22.359 --> 00:14:27.700
Caption: just to have a distraction-free kind of

00:14:25.989 --> 00:14:30.789
Caption: environment and designing again this

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:33.190
Caption: into your workflow and being okay with

00:14:30.789 --> 00:14:34.659
Caption: going okay I need to put in the measures

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:37.900
Caption: that I can focus

00:14:34.659 --> 00:14:39.819
Caption: Sam&#39;s talk touched on it earlier where

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.650
Caption: it was literally about going okay well

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.780
Caption: we have productivity tools that we you

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.369
Caption: know we can use and whatnot but there&#39;s

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.060
Caption: always going to be distractions and

00:14:45.369 --> 00:14:51.070
Caption: Nathan&#39;s talked about it too as having

00:14:48.059 --> 00:14:52.330
Caption: knowing when you are most productive and

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:55.450
Caption: working to those times

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:57.280
Caption: sorry working so your most productive

00:14:55.450 --> 00:15:00.000
Caption: times anything if you&#39;re not feeling it

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.580
Caption: is take a break

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.289
Caption: I&#39;m gonna distractions at work who who

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:07.020
Caption: gets those all the time you know quick

00:15:04.289 --> 00:15:10.139
Caption: question oh yeah yeah just quickly yeah

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:12.540
Caption: I&#39;ve got two minutes no worries um I&#39;ll

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.429
Caption: answer that for you but we you know we

00:15:12.539 --> 00:15:16.139
Caption: do the math there&#39;s never a two minute

00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:18.330
Caption: question and there&#39;s never just the one

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:21.480
Caption: that happens imagine if you get ten a

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:23.880
Caption: day not uncommon in an agency world it&#39;s

00:15:21.479 --> 00:15:27.179
Caption: 20 minutes for a week that&#39;s an hour and
