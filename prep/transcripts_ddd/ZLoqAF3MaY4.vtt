00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:20.559

00:00:19.038 --> 00:00:22.639
Caption: superman

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:25.358

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:28.799

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:34.398

00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:36.319

00:00:44.078 --> 00:00:48.558
Caption: reduces them to nothing as these

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:51.759
Caption: extremes which is such a great

00:00:48.558 --> 00:00:54.799
Caption: uh analogy for neurodiversity

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:56.558
Caption: because neurodiversity is about extremes

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.198
Caption: as you can see on the screen the rainbow

00:00:56.558 --> 00:01:01.599

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.238

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:05.599
Caption: for various cognitive skills

00:01:04.238 --> 00:01:07.519
Caption: a cognitive skill is a little bit

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:09.599
Caption: different to a regular skill a regular

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:12.478

Caption: uh designing a decision tree

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:23.839
Caption: where a cognitive skill is the skills

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.319
Caption: that underline and empower those

00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:27.919
Caption: stuff like your organizational ability

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.759
Caption: uh however you can organize your day and

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:30.959
Caption: your calendar your innovation skills how

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.880

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:36.158

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:39.039
Caption: ideas

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.360
Caption: your design skills your time management

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.040

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.199

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.159
Caption: neurodiversity have extreme strengths

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:50.158
Caption: and extreme weaknesses in these areas

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:52.639
Caption: where and it differs by different

00:01:50.158 --> 00:01:55.360
Caption: neurodiverse individuals for me i&#39;m very

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:57.279
Caption: good at organizing innovation

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.040
Caption: executive functioning skills but i can

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:00.559
Caption: struggle with time management sometimes

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.439
Caption: when i get a bit too focused into what

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:05.040
Caption: i&#39;m doing and miss a meeting

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.880
Caption: someone who&#39;s neurotypical still has

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.440

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:11.119
Caption: they&#39;re less extreme

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.878
Caption: so if you can often think about

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:16.000
Caption: neurodiverse people as people who are

00:02:12.878 --> 00:02:17.598
Caption: specialized in cognitive skills

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.520
Caption: and these cognitive skills empower their

00:02:17.598 --> 00:02:21.598
Caption: regular skills and

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.040
Caption: teams already have specialists

00:02:21.598 --> 00:02:25.119

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.000
Caption: explaining to the customer why what they

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.598
Caption: want is a bad idea

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.199
Caption: he comes in spends five minutes with the

00:02:29.598 --> 00:02:32.399
Caption: customer and the customer tells him it&#39;s

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.238
Caption: a bad idea

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:36.079
Caption: you have the sql ninja

00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:37.679
Caption: who can write a query that runs ten

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.279
Caption: times faster than the one you wrote

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:41.598
Caption: because she deeply understands the

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:43.919
Caption: underlying database you have the linux

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:45.839

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.279

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:49.039

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.238
Caption: jira so we can all enjoy it

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.158
Caption: and then you have perhaps the most

00:02:56.238 --> 00:03:00.080
Caption: important skill willing to write cobalt

00:02:58.158 --> 00:03:02.958

Caption: cloud guru and or the genius debugger

00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:07.279
Caption: someone who&#39;s neuroverse just fits

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.279
Caption: in as a cognitive specialist in in

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:11.039
Caption: addition to being a regular specialist

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.720
Caption: and that&#39;s how teams work we all have

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.639
Caption: our strengths our weaknesses and it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.238
Caption: makes us fit better together but let&#39;s

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:19.279
Caption: take a step back

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:22.000
Caption: and talk about what is neurodiversity

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.679
Caption: well what does the dictionary say

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.679
Caption: the range of differences in individual

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:28.158
Caption: brain function and painful traits rug

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:30.399
Caption: out as a part of normal variation in the

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:31.360
Caption: human population

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.679
Caption: well

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.518
Caption: that&#39;s quite obtuse as you&#39;d expect from

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:37.518
Caption: oxford dictionary but let&#39;s break it

00:03:35.518 --> 00:03:39.518
Caption: down a little bit

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:41.199
Caption: it&#39;s basically saying that people who

00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:42.399
Caption: are nervous have brains that function

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.878
Caption: differently

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:47.839
Caption: and because of that they have this can

00:03:44.878 --> 00:03:49.759
Caption: impact their behavior in various ways

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:51.360
Caption: basically people are nervous have minds

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:53.518
Caption: of different kinds

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.000
Caption: and that these differences are regarded

00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:57.438
Caption: as normal seen often in the human

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.279
Caption: population

00:03:57.438 --> 00:04:00.878
Caption: but whenever something has a normal

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.559
Caption: variation

00:04:00.878 --> 00:04:04.399
Caption: scientists big scientists like to put

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:06.639
Caption: names on it so let&#39;s look to talk about

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:08.958
Caption: stories in our very normal variations

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.039
Caption: these are six of the common

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:13.679
Caption: neurodiverse conditions

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:14.958
Caption: you have dyspraxia

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:17.119

Caption: skills empathy and intuition

00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:20.720
Caption: and when i talk about these conditions

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.160
Caption: typically when we talk about uh

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.440
Caption: neurodiverse conditions we talk about

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.279
Caption: what they struggle with and what their

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.040
Caption: weaknesses are and that&#39;s important

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:28.639
Caption: things to be aware of but today we&#39;ve

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.000
Caption: going to talk about the strengths

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.679
Caption: yield is calculator which are people

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.639

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.919

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:50.479
Caption: creative skills and 3d mechanical skills

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:51.679
Caption: and despite what you may think 3d

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.119
Caption: mechanical skills do come up with

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:55.759
Caption: software development

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:58.079

Caption: hyper focus energy and passion

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:02.478

Caption: passion no matter what time it is

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.639

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.360
Caption: like 2 a.m because something went wrong

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:23.359
Caption: and that really shows the strengths of

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:25.038
Caption: nervous people let&#39;s talk about

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:27.758
Caption: prevalence

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:30.160
Caption: around 17 ish percent of people have had

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.959
Caption: uh have neurodiversity four percent with

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.119
Caption: adhd one percent with autism ten percent

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:36.479
Caption: dyslexia one percent dyspraxia and one

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:37.679
Caption: percent tourettes

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.080
Caption: now there are two problems with these

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:41.359
Caption: statistics the first of all is it varies

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:43.279
Caption: by population

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:44.559
Caption: so our industry the software industry

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:47.199
Caption: tends to have a higher rate of

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:48.000
Caption: neurodiversity especially autism

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.239
Caption: where

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.720
Caption: and the second problem is

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:54.799
Caption: this is the universe is what&#39;s known as

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.399
Caption: a tip of the iceberg problem

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:58.000
Caption: there is the visible portion and that&#39;s

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.839
Caption: the portion of people who are diagnosed

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.839
Caption: and disclosed that they&#39;re diagnosed a

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.600
Caption: lot of people choose not to the other

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:05.199
Caption: problem being is to get diagnosed you

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.800
Caption: have to appear in father psychologists

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.039
Caption: at some point in your life

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:11.359
Caption: if things go well if your new diversity

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.199
Caption: maps onto society well that may never

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:14.399
Caption: happen so you can go your whole life not

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.000
Caption: knowing about it

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:17.839
Caption: and that&#39;s that&#39;s perfectly fine if

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.359
Caption: you&#39;re a happy person

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.959
Caption: there&#39;s one more thing to think about

00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:22.638
Caption: when it comes to talking about what

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:24.000
Caption: neurodiversity is

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.080
Caption: and that&#39;s

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.279
Caption: what neurodiversity is to people who are

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:28.799
Caption: neurodiverse

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:30.959
Caption: the most important idea to understand

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:32.478
Caption: here is different does not equal

Caption: disabled

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.839
Caption: so

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.199
Caption: nervous people think as i said of

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:38.559
Caption: themselves people with minds of

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.000

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:45.519

Caption: often

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:51.759
Caption: uh we see just the struggles but

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:53.359
Caption: that&#39;s because

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:54.639
Caption: they do come insurance

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:57.359
Caption: but the relationship between

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.479
Caption: neurodiversity and disability is complex

00:06:57.359 --> 00:07:00.319
Caption: some people who are neurodiverse are

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:02.800
Caption: disabled some are not

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:04.239

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:06.000
Caption: for this talk

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:07.519
Caption: but that&#39;s something to keep in mind and

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.799
Caption: there&#39;s a really good analogy to explain

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:10.319
Caption: this

00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:12.799

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:20.160

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.759
Caption: deadlines to meet

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.239

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:29.519
Caption: yourself am i disabled because everyone

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:29.519

00:08:29.598 --> 00:08:33.679
Caption: the nervous community and the disability

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.598
Caption: community would argue no

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:37.440
Caption: because you can still do

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:40.000
Caption: everything you need to have a fulfilling

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.239
Caption: life you can still work you can still

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.080
Caption: make your own meals you can still go to

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:45.518
Caption: social events you know when you go to

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.200
Caption: work you catch the bus they have to

00:08:45.518 --> 00:08:49.599
Caption: rename trans perf to trans you because

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.679
Caption: the only person who needs it now

00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:53.599
Caption: and more or less your life goes on but

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:55.278
Caption: then one day

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:56.719
Caption: some newfangled head comes along and

00:08:55.278 --> 00:08:59.039
Caption: goes well

00:08:56.719 --> 00:09:01.199
Caption: everybody can fly now so i&#39;m gonna build

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:03.440
Caption: a building for flying people he puts a

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.838
Caption: big long cylinder at the middle so you

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:07.919
Caption: can fly to the level you live on or want

00:09:05.838 --> 00:09:10.320
Caption: to visit he puts a big helipad on the

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:11.359
Caption: top so everyone can land a nice solid

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.440
Caption: ground

00:09:11.359 --> 00:09:16.079
Caption: and it&#39;s at this point

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.760
Caption: that you&#39;ve become a disabled person

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.398
Caption: because if you want to visit someone in

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.838
Caption: that tower or if you want to have a

00:09:20.398 --> 00:09:23.838
Caption: meeting in that tower you can&#39;t

00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:28.000
Caption: and this is where different doesn&#39;t

00:09:25.838 --> 00:09:29.679
Caption: equal disabled comes back in the reason

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.119
Caption: why neurodiverse people struggle so much

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:33.039
Caption: is they live in a society that wasn&#39;t

00:09:31.119 --> 00:09:35.278
Caption: designed for them

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:37.359
Caption: a someone with autism once quipped that

00:09:35.278 --> 00:09:39.599
Caption: to someone with autism society seems one

00:09:37.359 --> 00:09:42.320
Caption: that&#39;s disorganized chaotic and obsessed

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:43.599
Caption: with socializing in physical contact

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.559
Caption: and i&#39;m sure in your other neural

00:09:43.599 --> 00:09:47.278
Caption: conditions

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:49.119
Caption: neurodiversity would have similar points

00:09:47.278 --> 00:09:50.479
Caption: and this really is why allyship is so

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:53.119
Caption: important

00:09:50.479 --> 00:09:55.119
Caption: there&#39;s a artwork from the lgbt

00:09:53.119 --> 00:09:56.559
Caption: community that i really like which is on

00:09:55.119 --> 00:09:58.799
Caption: the slide right now

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:59.919
Caption: and explains why ally is a verb not a

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:01.599
Caption: noun

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:03.119
Caption: being an ally doesn&#39;t mean

00:10:01.599 --> 00:10:04.719
Caption: saying that you&#39;re alive being an ally

00:10:03.119 --> 00:10:06.958
Caption: doesn&#39;t mean

00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:08.719
Caption: bragging about it or putting into a row

00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:11.518
Caption: it means doing things

00:10:08.719 --> 00:10:13.518
Caption: so let&#39;s talk about what you can do

00:10:11.518 --> 00:10:15.200
Caption: so the first thing you can do is

00:10:13.518 --> 00:10:16.958
Caption: understand disclosure

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.398
Caption: some people

00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.479
Caption: uh might go their entire life being

00:10:18.398 --> 00:10:22.239
Caption: neurodiverse and they know it and they

00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:23.838
Caption: just don&#39;t want to tell you because it&#39;s

00:10:22.239 --> 00:10:25.919
Caption: a private health matter i don&#39;t expect

00:10:23.838 --> 00:10:28.239
Caption: you to tell me all your health matters

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:29.518
Caption: and why should expect me to tell yours

00:10:28.239 --> 00:10:30.719
Caption: and they can adapt while in the

00:10:29.518 --> 00:10:32.799
Caption: workplace because the way their

00:10:30.719 --> 00:10:35.838
Caption: neurodiversity manifests maps well onto

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:37.838
Caption: society and that&#39;s perfectly okay

00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:39.278
Caption: for other people however it&#39;s a serious

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:40.799
Caption: dilemma

00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:43.039
Caption: because they have to choose between

00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:44.559
Caption: disclosing and risking stigma because

00:10:43.039 --> 00:10:47.039
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of negative stereotypes

00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:49.359
Caption: around neurodiverse people from people

00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:51.759
Caption: with autism being unfriendly and

00:10:49.359 --> 00:10:53.599
Caption: disliking people to people with adhd

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.799
Caption: being annoying and never getting work

00:10:53.599 --> 00:10:55.919
Caption: done

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:57.440
Caption: and then they&#39;re worried that if they

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:58.398
Caption: disclose they&#39;ll get a lot of stigma

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.760
Caption: from it

00:10:58.398 --> 00:11:00.799
Caption: no matter what neurodiverse condition

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.640
Caption: you have

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:05.200
Caption: it&#39;s when you disclose it it&#39;s basically

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.440
Caption: admitting that you have a weakness

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.119
Caption: on the other hand if they don&#39;t disclose

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.398
Caption: then they struggle in science there are

00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:12.239
Caption: key changes that can be made to their

00:11:10.398 --> 00:11:14.239
Caption: job and their environment to get more

00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:16.559
Caption: performance and to get more quality of

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:19.599
Caption: life out that they don&#39;t but they can&#39;t

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:20.799
Caption: because they&#39;re so afraid

00:11:19.599 --> 00:11:23.039
Caption: and

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:24.880
Caption: if someone discloses to you

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:27.199
Caption: make sure to validate it make sure they

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.958
Caption: feel accepted and then ask how you can

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.239
Caption: make things better or if you need to

00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.518
Caption: make things better

00:11:30.239 --> 00:11:32.880
Caption: the other thing is

00:11:31.518 --> 00:11:34.639
Caption: make it clear that

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.440
Caption: your company is a space where

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.838
Caption: neurodiversity is accepted

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.278
Caption: um the one final point i make on

00:11:39.838 --> 00:11:42.719
Caption: disclosure and

00:11:41.278 --> 00:11:44.719
Caption: i kind of hate that i have to point this

00:11:42.719 --> 00:11:46.639
Caption: out but don&#39;t speculate about what

00:11:44.719 --> 00:11:48.719
Caption: conditions people have

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.639
Caption: because

00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:52.319
Caption: it&#39;s it puts can put some in a position

00:11:50.638 --> 00:11:54.398
Caption: where if you ask them hey i think you

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.799
Caption: have this condition

00:11:54.398 --> 00:11:58.159
Caption: then either they have to say if they

00:11:56.799 --> 00:12:00.000
Caption: have the condition they have to

00:11:58.159 --> 00:12:02.078
Caption: effectively lie to you or disclose when

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.440
Caption: they want to but if they don&#39;t it can be

00:12:02.078 --> 00:12:05.039
Caption: really insulting

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.799
Caption: at the end of the day

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:08.838
Caption: your speculation probably won&#39;t be very

00:12:06.799 --> 00:12:11.518
Caption: accurate because you&#39;re not a

00:12:08.838 --> 00:12:14.239
Caption: psychologist diagnosis is a serious

00:12:11.518 --> 00:12:16.559
Caption: thing and requires real knowledge

00:12:14.239 --> 00:12:18.320
Caption: let&#39;s talk about the environment

00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:19.838
Caption: when we design environments for

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.278
Caption: neurodiverse people or adjust

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:22.320
Caption: environments for narrative as people

00:12:21.278 --> 00:12:23.359
Caption: there are two things we&#39;re trying to

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.799
Caption: achieve

00:12:23.359 --> 00:12:26.398
Caption: the first is we&#39;re trying to reduce

00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:28.239
Caption: sensory overwhelm because people with

00:12:26.398 --> 00:12:29.440
Caption: neurodiversity get overwhelmed by their

00:12:28.239 --> 00:12:30.559
Caption: senses because it&#39;s processed

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.559
Caption: differently

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:35.599
Caption: the other thing we&#39;re trying to do is

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:37.039
Caption: reduce unnecessary socializing so we&#39;re

00:12:35.599 --> 00:12:38.159
Caption: all social creatures we enjoy having a

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:40.000
Caption: bit of a chat for banter and

00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:42.398
Caption: neurodiverse people as well

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.719
Caption: but every new diverse person has like a

00:12:42.398 --> 00:12:47.838
Caption: threshold for that like i don&#39;t like to

00:12:44.719 --> 00:12:49.518
Caption: banter as much as my team typically does

00:12:47.838 --> 00:12:51.039
Caption: but and just giving the opportunity for

00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:52.559
Caption: them to sort of take a step back from

00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:54.479
Caption: that

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:57.119
Caption: so let&#39;s talk about things in details

00:12:54.479 --> 00:12:58.638
Caption: first of all have areas with lower light

00:12:57.119 --> 00:13:00.159
Caption: uh this is a big one for beer and

00:12:58.638 --> 00:13:01.518
Caption: university they find light often very

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:02.799
Caption: overwhelming

00:13:01.518 --> 00:13:04.239
Caption: and if you could have air in your office

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:05.760
Caption: which is just a little bit darker maybe

00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:06.719
Caption: the lights are dimmed or some lights are

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.958
Caption: turned off and it can make a big

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:10.239
Caption: difference also avoid fluorescent

00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.000
Caption: lighting for the area because some

00:13:10.239 --> 00:13:13.359
Caption: people really even some neurodiverse

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.039
Caption: people really don&#39;t like influence and

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:16.719
Caption: lighting

00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:18.398
Caption: they have areas in co-working spaces

00:13:16.719 --> 00:13:20.799
Caption: which are slightly separated and or

00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:22.398
Caption: blocked off so if a big open plan area

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:24.000
Caption: you can make a big difference i&#39;ll give

00:13:22.398 --> 00:13:25.760
Caption: you an example of this when i did my

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.159
Caption: internship we had two

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.160
Caption: rows of tables and one at the end and

00:13:28.159 --> 00:13:32.239
Caption: this was repeated across the floor

00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:34.398
Caption: i always went to the table at the end

00:13:32.239 --> 00:13:35.359
Caption: because i felt that first of all if i

00:13:34.398 --> 00:13:37.518
Caption: was

00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:39.119
Caption: on that table in the corridor i felt

00:13:37.518 --> 00:13:41.198
Caption: like i was always staring at someone and

00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:43.440
Caption: someone was always watching me work the

00:13:41.198 --> 00:13:45.278
Caption: second reason is and i swear this isn&#39;t

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.119
Caption: why i chose the table at the end it had

00:13:45.278 --> 00:13:49.119
Caption: two giant monitors

00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:51.039
Caption: now i don&#39;t need that many monitors i&#39;m

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:52.479
Caption: a software developer not whatever needs

00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:53.359
Caption: two giant monitors

00:13:52.479 --> 00:13:55.039
Caption: but

00:13:53.359 --> 00:13:57.440
Caption: what it basically did is meant that

00:13:55.039 --> 00:13:58.880
Caption: there was a slight block so i didn&#39;t

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.078
Caption: have to sort of be in on the banter

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.160
Caption: someone talked to me they just have to

00:14:00.078 --> 00:14:04.559
Caption: move their chest slightly to the right

00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:06.719
Caption: and this really helped me focus

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:08.799
Caption: have quieter spaces so areas where

00:14:06.719 --> 00:14:10.159
Caption: there&#39;s just less talking or less other

00:14:08.799 --> 00:14:12.078
Caption: noise

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:13.518
Caption: allow the use of headphones or earmuffs

00:14:12.078 --> 00:14:14.638
Caption: so for example

00:14:13.518 --> 00:14:16.880
Caption: one of the things that pretty much

00:14:14.638 --> 00:14:17.919
Caption: necessary for me to cope is when i&#39;m not

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.359
Caption: talking to someone i usually have my

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:21.679
Caption: headphones on not just when i&#39;m coding

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:23.119
Caption: but also when i walk around the office

00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:25.359
Caption: uh if i see someone i want to talk to

00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:27.679
Caption: i&#39;ll just pop them off have a chat and

00:14:25.359 --> 00:14:29.359
Caption: then put back on i even bring them to

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:30.638
Caption: meetings with me so

00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:32.239
Caption: obviously i don&#39;t wear them in the

00:14:30.638 --> 00:14:34.078
Caption: meetings that would be kind of

00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:35.359
Caption: counter-intuitive though i&#39;m sure

00:14:34.078 --> 00:14:37.119
Caption: there&#39;s some meetings where we all wish

00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:38.638
Caption: we could wear a pair of headphones and

00:14:37.119 --> 00:14:40.320
Caption: just nod along

00:14:38.638 --> 00:14:41.679
Caption: but basically once the meeting was over

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.638
Caption: and everyone&#39;s dispersed i just pop them

00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:47.440
Caption: back on and continue with my flow

00:14:44.638 --> 00:14:48.638
Caption: uh be flexible around work areas for all

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.039
Caption: the environmental reasons i&#39;ve discussed

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:52.159
Caption: so far sometimes people who are nervous

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:53.119
Caption: really just like one area of the

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:55.759
Caption: building

00:14:53.119 --> 00:14:57.838
Caption: so example from my brother&#39;s company

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.518
Caption: someone with autism got promoted

00:14:57.838 --> 00:15:00.719
Caption: congratulations he&#39;s like oh awesome

00:14:59.518 --> 00:15:02.719
Caption: thanks

00:15:00.719 --> 00:15:06.319
Caption: here&#39;s your bigger office so he&#39;s like

00:15:02.719 --> 00:15:08.638
Caption: no thank you i like this small one

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.638
Caption: another example is i know someone with

00:15:08.638 --> 00:15:12.239
Caption: adhd and she

00:15:10.638 --> 00:15:14.958
Caption: uh her team moved from to a different

00:15:12.239 --> 00:15:16.958
Caption: building and she didn&#39;t like it as much

00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:18.479
Caption: so they worked out condition a

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.679
Caption: situation where she could work part-time

00:15:18.479 --> 00:15:21.838
Caption: with old building and part-time in the

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:21.838
Caption: new

00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:27.518
Caption: is this fight is bui a lot easier to

00:15:26.479 --> 00:15:29.679
Caption: make

00:15:27.518 --> 00:15:32.000
Caption: um even on teams of high collaborations

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:34.398
Caption: one day we can make a big difference so

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.359
Caption: i used to work at home one day a week

00:15:34.398 --> 00:15:36.958
Caption: and

00:15:35.359 --> 00:15:38.638
Caption: which is good because i like that day

00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:41.838
Caption: where i can work my optimum environment

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:43.359
Caption: at home and have a bit of a break but

00:15:41.838 --> 00:15:45.838
Caption: also seeing my team enough to really

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:47.758
Caption: build those professional relationships

00:15:45.838 --> 00:15:49.679
Caption: and provide opportunities to discuss

00:15:47.758 --> 00:15:51.119
Caption: environmental issues one little thing

00:15:49.679 --> 00:15:52.159
Caption: you can do

00:15:51.119 --> 00:15:54.559
Caption: is

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:55.919
Caption: you can just once or twice a quarter uh

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:58.320
Caption: post on your team

00:15:55.919 --> 00:15:59.440
Caption: teams uh or other shout out hey is there

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.559
Caption: anything about the environment you don&#39;t

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.559
Caption: like

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:04.559
Caption: uh if your team is anything like mine

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:06.000
Caption: you probably get some memes like i know

00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:07.599
Caption: what i don&#39;t like about the team greg

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.039
Caption: can get rid of him

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:10.479
Caption: but someone might have

00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:12.159
Caption: surreal feedback that will improve their

00:16:10.479 --> 00:16:14.159
Caption: life not necessarily even a new diverse

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:16.559
Caption: person maybe there&#39;s a plant that&#39;s

00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:18.479
Caption: really smelly maybe their office uh

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:21.119
Caption: their desk hasn&#39;t been a standing desk

00:16:18.479 --> 00:16:22.958
Caption: for a while between the motor broke

00:16:21.119 --> 00:16:25.919
Caption: and finally overall

00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:27.919
Caption: try to reduce sensory and socializing

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:29.278
Caption: reduction options for people with

00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:31.679
Caption: neurodiversity

00:16:29.278 --> 00:16:33.119
Caption: let&#39;s talk a little bit about job design

00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:34.880
Caption: first of all

00:16:33.119 --> 00:16:37.440
Caption: uh give the option provide written or

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.638
Caption: verbal instructions i don&#39;t know how

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.479
Caption: something i do personally i don&#39;t know

00:16:38.638 --> 00:16:42.638
Caption: how many other people can do this is

00:16:40.479 --> 00:16:44.719
Caption: whenever i give instructions to a team

00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:47.039
Caption: i type them up while i&#39;m talking so you

00:16:44.719 --> 00:16:49.359
Caption: get the benefit of both

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:51.198
Caption: uh give more detailed instructions if

00:16:49.359 --> 00:16:53.198
Caption: desired something that might manage to

00:16:51.198 --> 00:16:55.518
Caption: be dub on very quickly

00:16:53.198 --> 00:16:58.159
Caption: is that i need about 30 to 50 more

00:16:55.518 --> 00:17:00.078
Caption: detail instructions this isn&#39;t this line

00:16:58.159 --> 00:17:01.198
Caption: of code this line code and this lag code

00:17:00.078 --> 00:17:02.880
Caption: it&#39;s just

00:17:01.198 --> 00:17:04.719
Caption: here&#39;s where you get this from or hear

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.558
Caption: who you talk to

00:17:04.719 --> 00:17:08.400
Caption: uh adjust job sign where possible to

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:10.000
Caption: remove tasks they struggle with

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.438
Caption: if you know someone in university really

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.119
Caption: struggles with a task especially as a

00:17:11.438 --> 00:17:15.038
Caption: task that other people just find

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.958
Caption: perfectly normal

00:17:15.038 --> 00:17:18.639
Caption: uh you can read it does help a lot to

00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.640
Caption: reassign those tasks

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.239
Caption: and what you can do is sometimes people

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.318
Caption: with neurodiversity are really good at

00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:26.078
Caption: tasks that other people struggle with so

00:17:24.318 --> 00:17:28.640
Caption: you can balance that out a really

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:31.839
Caption: trivial example is is in my home i have

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.599
Caption: one there&#39;s liquid soap dispensers

00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:34.558
Caption: i really hate the feeling of conjured

00:17:33.599 --> 00:17:36.798
Caption: soap

00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:39.199
Caption: so i get my dad to refill it

00:17:36.798 --> 00:17:41.359
Caption: and in return i vacuum the whole house i

00:17:39.199 --> 00:17:43.918
Caption: think that&#39;s a pretty good deal

00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:45.918
Caption: um but just recruitment or have separate

00:17:43.918 --> 00:17:47.519
Caption: equipment for neurodiverse people so

00:17:45.918 --> 00:17:49.599
Caption: often we

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.760
Caption: we all kind of know that interviews

00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:53.119
Caption: aren&#39;t the best way to assess someone

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.719
Caption: just because you interview well doesn&#39;t

00:17:53.119 --> 00:17:56.239
Caption: mean that you&#39;re good at your job

00:17:54.719 --> 00:17:58.319
Caption: that&#39;s why a lot of companies have moved

00:17:56.239 --> 00:17:59.520
Caption: to stuff like you know sit down and

00:17:58.319 --> 00:18:02.159
Caption: write this algorithm for me or

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.719
Caption: whiteboard out solution or what have you

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.559
Caption: um you can make more adjustments in

00:18:04.719 --> 00:18:07.918
Caption: traditional recruitment methods through

00:18:06.558 --> 00:18:10.000
Caption: people who are neurodiversity for

00:18:07.918 --> 00:18:11.759
Caption: example if someone with autism

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.038
Caption: uh maybe give them 10 minutes alone with

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.959
Caption: a whiteboard

00:18:13.038 --> 00:18:16.959
Caption: or ideally have separate recruitment

00:18:14.959 --> 00:18:18.719
Caption: processes tailored for neurodiverse

00:18:16.959 --> 00:18:20.399
Caption: people a lot of companies especially

00:18:18.719 --> 00:18:23.119
Caption: have programs for people with autism who

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.039
Caption: typically don&#39;t interview well

00:18:23.119 --> 00:18:27.038
Caption: include neurodiversity in

00:18:25.038 --> 00:18:29.519
Caption: diversity and human resources policies

00:18:27.038 --> 00:18:31.918
Caption: and discussions if it&#39;s hopefully

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.359
Caption: already included that&#39;s not already uh

00:18:31.918 --> 00:18:34.079
Caption: shoot an email to whoever&#39;s in charge of

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:35.760
Caption: that

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:37.119
Caption: if it&#39;s hr you might earn yourself some

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.558
Caption: brownie points

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:40.839
Caption: normally the reason for it isn&#39;t

00:18:38.558 --> 00:18:42.558
Caption: anything malicious normally it&#39;s just

00:18:40.839 --> 00:18:44.880
Caption: oversight

00:18:42.558 --> 00:18:46.399
Caption: but all this is a lot of stuff

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.599
Caption: there&#39;s actually a simple activity i

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.919
Caption: really like

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:52.160
Caption: let&#39;s say you meet with your team on a

00:18:49.918 --> 00:18:54.079
Caption: regular basis daily or weekly

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.239
Caption: and it&#39;s always in the same room or a

00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:58.719
Caption: similar room and it&#39;s in one of these

00:18:56.239 --> 00:19:00.079
Caption: very fancy offices that we all tend to

00:18:58.719 --> 00:19:01.599
Caption: work in these days

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:02.880
Caption: often these officers have the ability to

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:05.038
Caption: dim the lights

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.280
Caption: and what you can do is you just take two

00:19:05.038 --> 00:19:09.199
Caption: minutes one meeting to say hey

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.880
Caption: i noticed the lights are difficult uh

00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:12.959
Caption: here&#39;s what looks at this level this

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.400
Caption: level this level does anyone have a

00:19:12.959 --> 00:19:16.880
Caption: preference

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.479
Caption: and a lot of people say no i don&#39;t

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.319
Caption: really have a preference but it might

00:19:18.479 --> 00:19:22.719
Caption: mean a lot to someone

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:24.319
Caption: and then if it means a lot to someone

00:19:22.719 --> 00:19:26.719
Caption: just reduce the lightning and start

00:19:24.319 --> 00:19:28.798
Caption: lighting at the side very meeting

00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:19.760
Caption: typically in a presentation like this

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:21.600
Caption: you would see the statistics on universe

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.479
Caption: people in employment

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:24.479
Caption: and

00:26:22.479 --> 00:26:26.880
Caption: i&#39;m not including them

00:26:24.479 --> 00:26:28.880
Caption: the reason for this is

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.199
Caption: when i was first getting diagnosed i

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.880
Caption: went to a presentation like that

00:26:31.199 --> 00:26:35.199
Caption: and that was so upsetting i almost left

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.199
Caption: the room

00:26:35.839 --> 00:26:39.918
Caption: they are pretty blue

00:26:37.678 --> 00:26:42.399
Caption: people who have narratives conditions

00:26:39.918 --> 00:26:43.359
Caption: struggle with both acquiring and keeping

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.960
Caption: work

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:47.678
Caption: and finding especially finding

00:26:44.959 --> 00:26:47.678
Caption: meaningful work

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:53.640
Caption: and now i suppose it&#39;s a good time to

00:26:49.439 --> 00:26:53.639
Caption: transition to talk about my own journey

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.239
Caption: all through out my life and especially

00:26:57.119 --> 00:27:00.158
Caption: after school

00:26:58.239 --> 00:27:02.880
Caption: i had this problem where you expect in

00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:04.960
Caption: life things will get better over time

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.199
Caption: you&#39;ll get a job you&#39;ll get promoted

00:27:04.959 --> 00:27:09.038
Caption: you&#39;ll um

00:27:07.199 --> 00:27:11.199
Caption: get a girlfriend you&#39;ll buy a house all

00:27:09.038 --> 00:27:13.519
Caption: those big life milestones

00:27:11.199 --> 00:27:14.880
Caption: but for me i found that i wasn&#39;t making

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.279
Caption: any progress

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.880
Caption: i felt constantly stressed overwhelmed

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:21.279
Caption: upset

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.279
Caption: i didn&#39;t know why

00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:24.799
Caption: eventually mental health issues filled

00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:26.880
Caption: that gap for me

00:27:24.798 --> 00:27:28.479
Caption: i felt really terrible about myself and

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.279
Caption: that eventually led to me

00:27:28.479 --> 00:27:31.678
Caption: um

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:32.960
Caption: being a pharmacologist but thankfully

00:27:31.678 --> 00:27:35.678
Caption: she picked up one

00:27:32.959 --> 00:27:38.158
Caption: very quickly that i had autism

00:27:35.678 --> 00:27:39.678
Caption: and gap gave me the tools to both

00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:41.520
Caption: understand myself

00:27:39.678 --> 00:27:44.558
Caption: and use the understanding to start

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.320
Caption: building things to get better

00:27:44.558 --> 00:27:49.038
Caption: so far on this talk i haven&#39;t really

00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:50.719
Caption: discussed much about neurology

00:27:49.038 --> 00:27:52.398
Caption: and there&#39;s a good reason for that i&#39;m

00:27:50.719 --> 00:27:53.918
Caption: not a neurologist

00:27:52.399 --> 00:27:57.600
Caption: however there is a really good way of

00:27:53.918 --> 00:27:59.278
Caption: explaining autism that i found and i&#39;ve

00:27:57.599 --> 00:28:00.640
Caption: given this explanation of neurology in

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:03.200
Caption: front of neurologists

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:06.159
Caption: and they didn&#39;t yell at me

00:28:03.199 --> 00:28:06.158
Caption: in fact one was like

00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:10.000
Caption: yeah that&#39;s about right

00:28:09.038 --> 00:28:11.519
Caption: so

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.279
Caption: let&#39;s do it

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.200
Caption: broadly speaking the brain can be

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:19.039
Caption: separated into three layers you have the

00:28:15.199 --> 00:28:21.678
Caption: reptile layer that&#39;s very fast very dumb

00:28:19.038 --> 00:28:23.839
Caption: uh that&#39;s good for stuff like um

00:28:21.678 --> 00:28:25.199
Caption: the flight of flight mechanism or you

00:28:23.839 --> 00:28:27.839
Caption: hear rust in the bushes and you&#39;re like

00:28:25.199 --> 00:28:30.558
Caption: girl what was that is that a tiger

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:32.239
Caption: uh in my backyard

00:28:30.558 --> 00:28:34.319
Caption: you have the intuition layer which is

00:28:32.239 --> 00:28:35.678
Caption: kind of slow kind of smart and sort of

00:28:34.319 --> 00:28:36.959
Caption: like when you have a general feeling

00:28:35.678 --> 00:28:39.119
Caption: about something like i feel this

00:28:36.959 --> 00:28:39.839
Caption: conversation is going well or

00:28:39.119 --> 00:28:41.359
Caption: i

00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:42.479
Caption: feel

00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:44.158
Caption: scared

00:28:42.479 --> 00:28:46.558
Caption: about this situation not actually their

00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:48.000
Caption: feelings but yourself interviews

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:49.760
Caption: and then above that you have the

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.959
Caption: cognitive layer which by comparison to

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.919
Caption: other ones is extremely slow but very

00:28:52.959 --> 00:28:55.439
Caption: smart

00:28:53.918 --> 00:28:57.278
Caption: this is when you actually stop and think

00:28:55.439 --> 00:28:59.199
Caption: through something think through the code

00:28:57.279 --> 00:29:01.279
Caption: you&#39;re working on or you think through a

00:28:59.199 --> 00:29:03.119
Caption: situation that you&#39;re in

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:04.960
Caption: people with autism

00:29:03.119 --> 00:29:06.558
Caption: lack that intuition layer and the

00:29:04.959 --> 00:29:08.880
Caption: cognitive layer has to take over

00:29:06.558 --> 00:29:10.640
Caption: basically all these responsibilities

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.039
Caption: and to illustrate this difference

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.719
Caption: i&#39;ll give an example when someone comes

00:29:13.038 --> 00:29:16.000
Caption: and gives you a hug

00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:18.158
Caption: what happens in your brain is on the

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.399
Caption: reptile like they go

00:29:18.159 --> 00:29:22.080
Caption: that&#39;s enormous look at his giant arms

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:24.799
Caption: he&#39;s going to attack me

00:29:22.079 --> 00:29:26.959
Caption: and start to send out warning signs now

00:29:24.798 --> 00:29:28.558
Caption: the intuition layer before the reptiles

00:29:26.959 --> 00:29:31.839
Caption: signals can even let leave the brain

00:29:28.558 --> 00:29:33.760
Caption: goes bad that&#39;s a hug i like hugs

00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:37.199
Caption: and then a million years later the

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:39.440
Caption: cognition brain catches up and goes oh

00:29:37.199 --> 00:29:42.158
Caption: that&#39;s nice i like hugs oh strange this

00:29:39.439 --> 00:29:44.239
Caption: person doesn&#39;t usually hug me

00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:46.000
Caption: in songs of autism&#39;s brain the red type

00:29:44.239 --> 00:29:48.158
Caption: brain goes

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.918
Caption: and then they either freeze up or

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:51.679
Caption: sometimes back away

00:29:49.918 --> 00:29:52.959
Caption: and then ages later the cognitive brain

00:29:51.678 --> 00:29:55.359
Caption: catches up

00:29:52.959 --> 00:29:57.918
Caption: and usually what happens is they think

00:29:55.359 --> 00:29:59.038
Caption: like ugh i hate hums my sisters are

00:29:57.918 --> 00:30:00.558
Caption: having me

00:29:59.038 --> 00:30:03.678
Caption: or

00:30:00.558 --> 00:30:03.678
Caption: let me stop a hug again

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.119
Caption: and this change

00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:10.080
Caption: manifests in a couple of interesting

00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:12.399
Caption: ways people autism tend to be smarter

00:30:10.079 --> 00:30:14.239
Caption: that&#39;s because their cognitive brain is

00:30:12.399 --> 00:30:15.760
Caption: constantly being worked out

00:30:14.239 --> 00:30:17.278
Caption: but people with autism

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.239
Caption: also tend to get overwhelmed honestly

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:20.480
Caption: because

00:30:18.239 --> 00:30:22.798
Caption: every single process approach every

00:30:20.479 --> 00:30:24.398
Caption: single change that presented to them

00:30:22.798 --> 00:30:25.760
Caption: they have to process

00:30:24.399 --> 00:30:27.039
Caption: on the conversation they have to stop

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.359
Caption: and think through it

00:30:27.038 --> 00:30:31.038
Caption: this is why people don&#39;t like systems

00:30:29.359 --> 00:30:32.158
Caption: because once you systematize something

00:30:31.038 --> 00:30:34.158
Caption: you don&#39;t have to think about it you

00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:37.039
Caption: just follow the system

00:30:34.159 --> 00:30:38.960
Caption: um this is also white people with autism

00:30:37.038 --> 00:30:40.319
Caption: so i i find that when there&#39;s a small

00:30:38.959 --> 00:30:41.599
Caption: change i actually have to stop and think

00:30:40.319 --> 00:30:43.359
Caption: about sometimes

00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:44.719
Caption: like for example imagine you think you

00:30:43.359 --> 00:30:46.558
Caption: know what someone is you go over there

00:30:44.719 --> 00:30:48.398
Caption: looking for them and they&#39;re not there

00:30:46.558 --> 00:30:49.119
Caption: i once uh turned the corner and we&#39;ll

00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:50.559
Caption: just

00:30:49.119 --> 00:30:52.479
Caption: stared at the person&#39;s desk for a good

00:30:50.558 --> 00:30:56.000
Caption: minute until the slightly unfriendly

00:30:52.479 --> 00:30:56.000
Caption: person next to him said what

00:30:56.399 --> 00:30:59.919
Caption: i was like

00:30:57.599 --> 00:31:01.918
Caption: so that would be an awkward situation

00:30:59.918 --> 00:31:04.000
Caption: so let&#39;s talk about what happened after

00:31:01.918 --> 00:31:05.599
Caption: my diagnosis

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.599
Caption: so i struggled with socializing and

00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:10.319
Caption: productivity

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:12.319
Caption: i passed most of my bachelor&#39;s degree

00:31:10.319 --> 00:31:14.558
Caption: which is four productive hours a week

00:31:12.319 --> 00:31:16.558
Caption: and i got pretty good grades

00:31:14.558 --> 00:31:18.398
Caption: on average i&#39;d sometimes go weeks at a

00:31:16.558 --> 00:31:20.479
Caption: time without having any productive hours

00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:23.200
Caption: and then do like 12 hours and complete a

00:31:20.479 --> 00:31:24.479
Caption: project in a day

00:31:23.199 --> 00:31:26.239
Caption: over time

00:31:24.479 --> 00:31:28.000
Caption: i got so much support from the

00:31:26.239 --> 00:31:30.880
Caption: university system and from my

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.399
Caption: psychologist and from my doctor

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.519
Caption: and most importantly from a mentor

00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:37.360
Caption: and

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:40.320
Caption: this led to progress at a time where i

00:31:37.359 --> 00:31:41.760
Caption: went from 4 hours to 8 hours to 16 hours

00:31:40.319 --> 00:31:44.079
Caption: to 20 hours

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:46.159
Caption: eventually to 30 hours

00:31:44.079 --> 00:31:48.398
Caption: and this is where i felt i was ready to

00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:51.039
Caption: test my progress so

00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:52.720
Caption: i applied for woodside on

00:31:51.038 --> 00:31:55.119
Caption: a friend&#39;s recommendation

00:31:52.719 --> 00:31:57.518
Caption: and i offered a job and i died i

00:31:55.119 --> 00:31:59.279
Caption: disclosed that autism immediately

00:31:57.519 --> 00:32:01.359
Caption: and they were so supportive i found that

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:02.880
Caption: supportive team hr came in before i even

00:32:01.359 --> 00:32:03.918
Caption: arrived at the business

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.959
Caption: and

00:32:03.918 --> 00:32:06.239
Caption: gave the team a whole bunch of

00:32:04.959 --> 00:32:07.839
Caption: information

00:32:06.239 --> 00:32:10.000
Caption: and when things were struggling the team

00:32:07.839 --> 00:32:12.558
Caption: was there for support

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.880
Caption: and because of all this

00:32:12.558 --> 00:32:16.398
Caption: i know someone who can work

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.918
Caption: because i do conserve myself as someone

00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:20.080
Caption: with a disability in the way it might be

00:32:17.918 --> 00:32:22.479
Caption: due to the way my orgasm presents itself

00:32:20.079 --> 00:32:24.959
Caption: i went from someone who five years ago

00:32:22.479 --> 00:32:27.199
Caption: in 2016 when i was diagnosed could not

00:32:24.959 --> 00:32:29.678
Caption: have a job and thanks to the allyship

00:32:27.199 --> 00:32:30.959
Caption: and support of people from university to

00:32:29.678 --> 00:32:32.398
Caption: the workplace

00:32:30.959 --> 00:32:34.398
Caption: i am now someone who can hold down a

00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:36.480
Caption: full-time job and i know i have a lot of

00:32:34.399 --> 00:32:37.679
Caption: value to give

00:32:36.479 --> 00:32:39.119
Caption: and that&#39;s why i&#39;m giving this

00:32:37.678 --> 00:32:40.558
Caption: presentation because i believe it&#39;s an

00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:42.000
Caption: important message

00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:43.918
Caption: and it&#39;s why i&#39;m so thankful to our

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.199
Caption: sponsors

00:32:43.918 --> 00:32:47.839
Caption: if it wasn&#39;t for the generous

00:32:45.199 --> 00:32:50.719
Caption: sponsorship of the people on the screen

00:32:47.839 --> 00:32:52.719
Caption: this event would not be able to happen

00:32:50.719 --> 00:32:53.839
Caption: and we won&#39;t be able to share important

00:32:52.719 --> 00:32:54.880
Caption: messages that we&#39;ve been able to share

00:32:53.839 --> 00:32:56.398
Caption: today

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.719
Caption: both important technical things which

00:32:56.399 --> 00:33:00.399
Caption: makes us all better at our jobs
