00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.800
Caption: thanking our amazing sponsors um without

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.479
Caption: them we wouldn&#39;t be able to do today and

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.319
Caption: also our community members as well just

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.639
Caption: wanted to give them a bit of a shout out

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:18.959
Caption: and all the volunteers for ddd walking

00:00:16.639 --> 00:00:20.879
Caption: around today um just a huge shadow and

Caption: thank you to them as well

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:25.278
Caption: so i&#39;m gonna go straight into it today

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:27.598
Caption: so for the next 45 minutes i&#39;m going to

00:00:25.278 --> 00:00:29.518
Caption: be talking about the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.119
Caption: very much avoided world of challenging

00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:33.919
Caption: conversations

00:00:31.118 --> 00:00:35.840
Caption: i have avoided them i&#39;m assuming a lot

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:38.799
Caption: of people in this room on the camera

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.159
Caption: have avoided challenging conversations

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:43.520
Caption: and that&#39;s a natural tendency they are

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.680
Caption: somewhat terrifying for a lot of

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.399
Caption: individuals and today i&#39;m hoping to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.520
Caption: provide you with the puzzle pieces to

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:52.078
Caption: make them

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.319
Caption: a little less intimidating to give you

00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:56.878
Caption: the confidence to have them

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:58.639
Caption: and the confidence to know that you are

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.760
Caption: less likely to damage relationships by

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:03.919
Caption: having these conversations

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.798
Caption: specifically what i&#39;m going to cover

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:05.759
Caption: is

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.520
Caption: we have

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.119
Caption: we&#39;re you know delightfully complex

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:10.719
Caption: human beings we are

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.479
Caption: so i&#39;m going to go through our amazing

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.040
Caption: brains and how

00:01:12.478 --> 00:01:16.719
Caption: what is happening in here is going to

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.879
Caption: contribute to these challenging

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.639
Caption: conversations because i feel as though

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:22.000
Caption: if you know you know knowledge is power

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:24.080
Caption: and if you know more about what&#39;s going

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.759
Caption: on up here in these conversations it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.759
Caption: tends to help well it helps me

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.799
Caption: understand what&#39;s going on in them

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.000
Caption: we&#39;re going to look at some key

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.759
Caption: considerations so this is just what to

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.079
Caption: consider before you have a challenging

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.040
Caption: conversation and some things that might

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.959
Caption: help

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.959
Caption: reduce that anxiety of having them as

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:42.559
Caption: well then we&#39;re going to look at some

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.919
Caption: feedback models

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:45.680
Caption: this is

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:48.000
Caption: some proven models that are out there

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.680
Caption: that will help with delivering some

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.519
Caption: feedback if that is the situation that

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.079
Caption: you&#39;re in and then lastly we&#39;re going to

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:56.478
Caption: look at a framework and this is going to

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.920
Caption: help you prepare for those conversations

00:01:56.478 --> 00:02:00.718
Caption: and just make you feel a little bit more

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:02.559
Caption: confident in having them

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.040
Caption: the person that inspired me for this

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:06.319
Caption: talk you know i was talking about a

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.919
Caption: challenging conversation with an

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.000
Caption: individual and they&#39;re like oh no way

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.919
Caption: that&#39;s terrifying there is i&#39;m not

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.598
Caption: having this conversation and so they&#39;re

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:15.679
Caption: the reason i&#39;m doing the talk today

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:19.839
Caption: because i want to

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:19.839
Caption: help make them less terrifying basically

00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.878
Caption: so just to cover

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.839
Caption: the key elements as to

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:27.598
Caption: why

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:30.238
Caption: um a lot of people find them so

00:02:27.598 --> 00:02:31.679
Caption: intimidating terrifying if you will is

00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:32.958
Caption: they usually involve a lot of

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:36.000
Caption: uncertainty

00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:37.518
Caption: so you know you go into a conversation

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.598
Caption: you have no idea how that individual is

00:02:37.518 --> 00:02:41.518
Caption: going to react even if you know them

00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:44.399
Caption: really really well

00:02:41.518 --> 00:02:46.080
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty around

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:49.598
Caption: what how you might react and what you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.479
Caption: might say in those situations as well

00:02:49.598 --> 00:02:53.518
Caption: there&#39;s

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:55.518
Caption: typically a lot of emotions involved in

00:02:53.518 --> 00:02:57.199
Caption: challenging conversations and this is

00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:59.759
Caption: where we&#39;re going to go more into our

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:02.399
Caption: brains later on as well around you know

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:05.639
Caption: what is going on that um attributes to

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.639
Caption: these emotions

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:10.720
Caption: they&#39;re usually necessary so having a

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:12.319
Caption: challenging conversation be because

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.559
Caption: there is a delay in a project for

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.080
Caption: example is usually necessary to get that

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.679
Caption: project from a to b

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.759
Caption: or they&#39;re usually necessary because

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:21.839
Caption: there is a problem within the team and

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:24.158
Caption: you need to talk to someone um in order

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:28.798
Caption: to to rectify that problem so they&#39;re

00:03:24.158 --> 00:03:31.360
Caption: often necessary and often avoided which

00:03:28.798 --> 00:03:32.878
Caption: i think if you avoid a conversation

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.360
Caption: that&#39;s a missed opportunity for

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:37.039
Caption: potential growth so they are often

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.839
Caption: necessary and something that we really

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:42.158
Caption: do need to to get better at

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.759
Caption: as individuals to make sure that we&#39;re

00:03:42.158 --> 00:03:46.000
Caption: you know fixing some problems out there

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:48.319
Caption: as well

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.559
Caption: and as well as being necessary to fix

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.518
Caption: potential problems they often if they&#39;re

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:54.559
Caption: done well lead to growth and this is

00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:56.559
Caption: because

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:57.919
Caption: if they&#39;re done well then they lead to

00:03:56.559 --> 00:04:00.559
Caption: growth for that individual you&#39;ve

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:02.399
Caption: highlighted something new to them

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:03.679
Caption: or they can lead to growth for yourself

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.958
Caption: so you know going through the framework

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.798
Caption: today hopefully if you have these

00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.238
Caption: conversations more

00:04:06.798 --> 00:04:10.158
Caption: they&#39;ll lead to growth for you as an

00:04:08.238 --> 00:04:13.360
Caption: individual as well

00:04:10.158 --> 00:04:15.279
Caption: so i&#39;m going to dive straight into it

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.720
Caption: there&#39;s a bit of interaction here so

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:18.799
Caption: people in this room can do it and on

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.720
Caption: camera i&#39;m hoping you do as well

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.559
Caption: but what i want you to do is with your

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.559
Caption: dominant hand click five times

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.040
Caption: excellent now with your other hand i

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:31.519
Caption: want you to write the capital e on your

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.520
Caption: forehead

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.759
Caption: great hoping people online are doing

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.399
Caption: this

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.959
Caption: so what this does it&#39;s not a definitive

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:43.199
Caption: exercise it&#39;s a bit of fun but what it

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:46.000
Caption: does is highlights the importance of

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.320
Caption: perspective so there&#39;s two ways that

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.160
Caption: individuals would have written the e

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.440
Caption: here you would have written it for

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.239
Caption: either yourself

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.559
Caption: to read it or for others to read it and

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:58.559
Caption: this is probably the biggest component

00:04:56.559 --> 00:05:00.479
Caption: of challenging conversations

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:02.720
Caption: if you go into them thinking that your

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.320
Caption: perspective and the way that you write

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.079
Caption: the e is

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.440
Caption: the only thing to take into

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:10.239
Caption: consideration you&#39;re going to

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.039
Caption: immediately fail before you start so

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:12.959
Caption: this

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.880
Caption: is what&#39;s called the e-test

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:17.839
Caption: you know obviously it&#39;s um

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.000
Caption: it is something that i like to do before

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:21.600
Caption: a challenging conversation now that i

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Caption: know the kind of

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.919
Caption: you know way it&#39;s done what it does do

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.440
Caption: though is puts me in the right mindset

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.520
Caption: so am i walking into this challenging

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.759
Caption: conversation thinking about how someone

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:34.399
Caption: else is perceiving something or am i

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.519
Caption: walking in purely with my lens here

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:37.119
Caption: um

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:39.519
Caption: you could i tried this on my

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:40.959
Caption: four-year-old and um

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:42.720
Caption: i i don&#39;t recommend doing this for

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:44.399
Caption: children we spend about an hour talking

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.799
Caption: about how she couldn&#39;t use a permanent

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:48.880
Caption: marker on her forehead to write an e

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:51.599
Caption: so i would say above the age of four is

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.440
Caption: the ideal age to use this based on my

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.119
Caption: extensive research

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.799
Caption: but again it&#39;s just a little bit of fun

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:58.239
Caption: and it&#39;s nice to put you into that right

00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:59.679
Caption: right headspace before a challenging

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:01.199
Caption: convo

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:03.119
Caption: and i wanted to spend just a little bit

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.679
Caption: more time on perspective here because i

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:07.759
Caption: really do think it&#39;s absolutely key for

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:09.359
Caption: challenging conversations

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.639
Caption: so you can see these two images here and

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:13.679
Caption: this one

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.679
Caption: on the left is one i think a lot of you

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:17.279
Caption: would have seen in this room

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:19.039
Caption: and let&#39;s look at it in a few ways so

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.399
Caption: we&#39;ve got here

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.799
Caption: some people perceive

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:24.880
Caption: to see what what they perceive to see as

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:27.039
Caption: a younger woman

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.479
Caption: some see an older woman

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:33.360
Caption: others see a beaver or an eagle my

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:36.160
Caption: daughter sees a butterfly

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:38.719
Caption: i don&#39;t see the beaver or eagle at all

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.399
Caption: and um for those who want to know

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.799
Caption: you know where the other images are you

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:44.319
Caption: can come after me ask me afterwards but

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:46.559
Caption: i don&#39;t see the beaver and eagle and i

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:49.119
Caption: have stared at this image for

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:50.000
Caption: an inappropriately long amount of time

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:51.839
Caption: and

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.598
Caption: it&#39;s not there for me but what i&#39;m

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:55.359
Caption: saying and highlighting here is that

00:06:53.598 --> 00:06:56.880
Caption: just because i can&#39;t see it doesn&#39;t mean

00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:58.399
Caption: that it doesn&#39;t exist

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.598
Caption: and this is what we have to think about

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:01.039
Caption: before going into challenging

00:06:59.598 --> 00:07:03.679
Caption: conversations

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:05.360
Caption: is what you can see might be the

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:08.399
Caption: complete opposite of what someone else

00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:11.119
Caption: can see it&#39;s a huge huge consideration

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:13.440
Caption: in terms of challenging conversations

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:15.759
Caption: the way to um i&#39;ll just jump back to

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.360
Caption: that one actually

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:20.080
Caption: the way to

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:22.478
Caption: go into a challenging conversation is

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:24.399
Caption: approaching it with that curiosity so

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:27.759
Caption: putting your feelings aside and putting

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:29.199
Caption: more of a curiosity mindset so before

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:32.000
Caption: going to a challenging conversation

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:34.160
Caption: instead of going you know someone did x

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.639
Caption: and i&#39;m mad at them for that that is

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.080
Caption: your perspective here

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.679
Caption: rather than saying

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:41.839
Caption: you know i&#39;m mad at them go you know

00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:44.479
Caption: they did this i&#39;m curious as to why they

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:46.559
Caption: reacted like that it&#39;s the you know it&#39;s

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:48.319
Caption: a more productive conversation it&#39;ll be

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:50.639
Caption: more conducive to growth

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:53.119
Caption: um so huge if you take nothing else away

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:55.279
Caption: from today that is what i want you to to

00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:57.839
Caption: walk away with

00:07:55.279 --> 00:08:01.598
Caption: now we&#39;re going to go

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:03.199
Caption: our brain this is my favorite topic so i

00:08:01.598 --> 00:08:04.878
Caption: am going to

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:07.119
Caption: not spend too long on this slide because

00:08:04.878 --> 00:08:09.119
Caption: i could talk for about 45 minutes on the

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:10.720
Caption: psychology behind our brains so i&#39;ll

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:12.479
Caption: spare you all

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.160
Caption: but what we&#39;ve got here is

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:15.519
Caption: amazing clip art

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.119
Caption: by myself

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:20.559
Caption: i&#39;m not a um creative in any way so

00:08:19.119 --> 00:08:24.079
Caption: you know be gentle with me on these

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:26.720
Caption: slides um but what we&#39;ve got here is

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:28.959
Caption: our brain it is not um

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.079
Caption: anatomically correct but it&#39;s roughly

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:31.919
Caption: there so what we get here is our

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:32.958
Caption: prefrontal cortex so this area of the

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:35.359
Caption: brain

00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:37.278
Caption: this is in charge of our executive

00:08:35.359 --> 00:08:40.559
Caption: thinking this is the part of the brain

00:08:37.278 --> 00:08:42.718
Caption: that we want to use a lot more

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:44.479
Caption: then we&#39;ve got the limbic system here

00:08:42.718 --> 00:08:46.000
Caption: and this is where

00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:48.479
Caption: the amygdala there&#39;s actually two of

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.200
Caption: them but the amygdala sits in here

00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:53.679
Caption: and the limbic system is in charge for

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.080
Caption: emotions and then we&#39;ve got the amygdala

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:58.320
Caption: which is responsible for our fight or

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.559
Caption: flight now this is

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.119
Caption: very much simplifying the brain is much

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:04.559
Caption: more complex than this beautiful clip

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:06.080
Caption: art but

00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:08.719
Caption: it gives you a rough idea as to what is

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.398
Caption: happening here now i&#39;m going to go

00:09:08.719 --> 00:09:11.599
Caption: through how these three components of

00:09:10.398 --> 00:09:12.880
Caption: the brain

00:09:11.599 --> 00:09:16.000
Caption: really really contribute to a

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.000
Caption: challenging conversation

00:09:16.559 --> 00:09:21.119
Caption: so we&#39;ve got here when our brain reacts

00:09:18.398 --> 00:09:22.479
Caption: to physiological stress such as a

00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:24.398
Caption: challenging conversation

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:26.398
Caption: and for your benefit our brains react

00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:29.200
Caption: the same way to a physical

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:31.359
Caption: or emotional stress so it&#39;s it&#39;s they

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.600
Caption: react the same way so it&#39;s equally as

00:09:31.359 --> 00:09:35.599
Caption: important so what happens is what&#39;s

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:37.119
Caption: called the amygdala hijack

00:09:35.599 --> 00:09:39.039
Caption: and that is when

00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:41.359
Caption: the amygdala here sends out all these

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:42.719
Caption: signals releases all of these stress

00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:43.679
Caption: hormones

00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:46.879
Caption: and

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:49.919
Caption: starts to do things like send blood flow

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.398
Caption: to our limbs and away from that great

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:54.239
Caption: prefrontal cortex part of our brain so

00:09:52.398 --> 00:09:55.440
Caption: it sends blood to our limbs to

00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:57.039
Caption: physically

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.119
Caption: fight or flight

00:09:57.039 --> 00:10:01.518
Caption: um so you need to you know have blood in

00:09:59.119 --> 00:10:03.119
Caption: those areas to get up and leave

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:04.639
Caption: or fight the person which you know

00:10:03.119 --> 00:10:06.239
Caption: really we don&#39;t want to do in these

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.000
Caption: situations

00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:09.679
Caption: and that is what&#39;s happening it&#39;s taking

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Caption: the blood away from all these parts that

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:14.320
Caption: we need and then what happens as a

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Caption: result is we start to lose things like

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.958
Caption: our logic

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.719
Caption: our ability to listen to the individual

00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.640
Caption: our empathy which is really important in

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:24.639
Caption: a challenging conversation and our

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.838
Caption: problem solving as well

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.040
Caption: this

00:10:25.838 --> 00:10:29.919
Caption: amygdala hijack situation is fantastic

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:33.278
Caption: for

00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:35.359
Caption: actual survival purposes it is not so

00:10:33.278 --> 00:10:37.919
Caption: fantastic for things like challenging

00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:40.958
Caption: conversations or public speaking for

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:44.239
Caption: example so that is why when people often

00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:46.719
Caption: get up and do a talk like today i am not

00:10:44.239 --> 00:10:48.239
Caption: going to remember every word that i have

00:10:46.719 --> 00:10:50.239
Caption: written down here

00:10:48.239 --> 00:10:52.398
Caption: because there would be an element of my

00:10:50.239 --> 00:10:54.398
Caption: brain trying to go into this fight or

00:10:52.398 --> 00:10:56.159
Caption: flight mode because there is an element

00:10:54.398 --> 00:10:58.159
Caption: of being stressed out about getting in

00:10:56.159 --> 00:11:00.239
Caption: front of people and talking and what i&#39;m

00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:01.919
Caption: going to do is show you some tips on how

00:11:00.239 --> 00:11:04.958
Caption: to reduce that i&#39;ll show you what&#39;s

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:07.599
Caption: going on in my brain right now to reduce

00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:09.518
Caption: me going into this

00:11:07.599 --> 00:11:11.199
Caption: where i would lose complete logic and

00:11:09.518 --> 00:11:12.958
Caption: the ability to talk to you about the

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.838
Caption: topic that i have spent quite a long

00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.838
Caption: time looking at

00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:19.838
Caption: so how can we avoid it so these are some

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.160
Caption: tips

00:11:19.838 --> 00:11:24.479
Caption: first tip i&#39;m going to go through is um

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:27.039
Caption: one that i had probably two days ago

00:11:24.479 --> 00:11:29.199
Caption: from a colleague at first mode and that

00:11:27.039 --> 00:11:31.359
Caption: is eat a banana

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.518
Caption: apparently there is a natural beta

00:11:31.359 --> 00:11:35.039
Caption: blockers in bananas that are released

00:11:33.518 --> 00:11:36.880
Caption: now i&#39;ve been reading up on it since

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:39.518
Caption: then and you would have to eat

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:43.039
Caption: quite a few bananas but i&#39;m willing i&#39;m

00:11:39.518 --> 00:11:44.799
Caption: willing before if we get to do this in

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:46.799
Caption: front of a large crowd i&#39;m gonna eat

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:49.440
Caption: like five bananas beforehand

00:11:46.799 --> 00:11:52.000
Caption: um and i will test the theory and if

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.479
Caption: it&#39;s placebo or not i don&#39;t care i think

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.078
Caption: um it&#39;ll be a bit of fun anyway

00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:58.479
Caption: but

00:11:56.078 --> 00:12:00.078
Caption: the best thing we can do

00:11:58.479 --> 00:12:02.398
Caption: to avoid

00:12:00.078 --> 00:12:05.199
Caption: fight or flight or reduce it

00:12:02.398 --> 00:12:07.440
Caption: is recognize it and what i mean by that

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.000
Caption: is there&#39;s a thing called a stress or

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.000
Caption: amygdala audit and that is where you

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.919
Caption: know individuals on the call sorry on

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.679
Caption: the video or in this room

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:16.719
Caption: just have a think about your individual

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:18.398
Caption: response

00:12:16.719 --> 00:12:20.078
Caption: so we are all

00:12:18.398 --> 00:12:20.958
Caption: individuals i can&#39;t tell you that every

00:12:20.078 --> 00:12:23.359
Caption: single one of you are going to

00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:24.880
Caption: experience these symptoms up here

00:12:23.359 --> 00:12:26.958
Caption: because that&#39;s what makes us so unique

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.479
Caption: and amazing

00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.078
Caption: so have a quick think

00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:31.518
Caption: at the moment as to what your stress

00:12:30.078 --> 00:12:32.398
Caption: response is

00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:35.039
Caption: mine

00:12:32.398 --> 00:12:37.278
Caption: is i can feel my heart rate it starts to

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:38.958
Caption: increase when i get stressed so as soon

00:12:37.278 --> 00:12:41.039
Caption: as i start to feel it out i&#39;m like okay

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:43.518
Caption: i know i know what&#39;s happening i start

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:46.559
Caption: to tremble so you&#39;ll see people up

00:12:43.518 --> 00:12:48.880
Caption: during talks really trembling and that

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:51.838
Caption: is a um they don&#39;t want to be doing that

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.919
Caption: that is a subconscious reaction to

00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:55.599
Caption: stress so you know people don&#39;t want to

00:12:53.919 --> 00:12:58.000
Caption: be showing these visible signs it is

00:12:55.599 --> 00:12:59.838
Caption: their brains that are doing this to them

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.559
Caption: so the best thing to do

00:12:59.838 --> 00:13:05.039
Caption: is recognize your individual stress

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:07.838
Caption: response because once you know that and

00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:09.359
Caption: once you know your individual response

00:13:07.838 --> 00:13:11.919
Caption: you can then put some things in place to

00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:14.159
Caption: reduce that

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:16.239
Caption: so you can use some of these tips and

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:18.879
Caption: again i say some because there is a lot

00:13:16.239 --> 00:13:21.200
Caption: more out there we could have another 20

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.720
Caption: slides on this topic

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.760
Caption: what you can do is if you start to see

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:28.479
Caption: these signs in yourself or individuals

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.799
Caption: that you&#39;re speaking to so for example

00:13:28.479 --> 00:13:32.799
Caption: part of my role is to have challenging

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:34.398
Caption: conversations it&#39;s not my favorite part

00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:35.278
Caption: of my role

00:13:34.398 --> 00:13:37.119
Caption: but

00:13:35.278 --> 00:13:39.198
Caption: it is what it is

00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:40.880
Caption: i start to see a lot of this so the

00:13:39.198 --> 00:13:42.000
Caption: flushed skin

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.679
Caption: when you&#39;re talking to individuals and

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.838
Caption: they&#39;re getting stressed their voice

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:46.958
Caption: will change they&#39;ll get kind of visibly

00:13:45.838 --> 00:13:49.278
Caption: flushed

00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:51.440
Caption: and this is when i start to put some of

00:13:49.278 --> 00:13:53.679
Caption: these things in place to help them as

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.119
Caption: individuals as well so it can help you

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:57.278
Caption: and it can help them

00:13:55.119 --> 00:13:59.518
Caption: so the first one here is breathe and it

00:13:57.278 --> 00:14:01.599
Caption: sounds quite simple but

00:13:59.518 --> 00:14:04.000
Caption: taking that moment to breathe

00:14:01.599 --> 00:14:05.440
Caption: i should probably do it during this talk

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.919
Caption: i&#39;m terrible at it

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.958
Caption: um taking that moment this big deep

00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:10.719
Caption: breath in

00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.638
Caption: and that&#39;s because when we breathe you

00:14:10.719 --> 00:14:15.119
Caption: get that delicious oxygen into your body

00:14:12.638 --> 00:14:17.838
Caption: which increases blood flow and as we

00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:20.078
Caption: said before we want more blood flow

00:14:17.838 --> 00:14:22.159
Caption: going to that prefrontal cortex area of

00:14:20.078 --> 00:14:24.799
Caption: our brain so there&#39;s a lot of reasons

00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:26.239
Caption: why breathing is really good

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:28.799
Caption: a lot of reasons keeps us alive right

00:14:26.239 --> 00:14:30.719
Caption: but deep breathing is what i mean

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:33.198
Caption: labeling it so that&#39;s what i&#39;m doing

00:14:30.719 --> 00:14:36.078
Caption: today if i start to feel my heart

00:14:33.198 --> 00:14:38.078
Caption: increase if my hands start to tremble

00:14:36.078 --> 00:14:39.679
Caption: i&#39;m telling myself like siobhan chill

00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:41.119
Caption: this is your brain

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:43.119
Caption: doing this to you

00:14:41.119 --> 00:14:45.119
Caption: and what this does is this

00:14:43.119 --> 00:14:46.880
Caption: goes back to the prefrontal cortex of

00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:49.278
Caption: our brain because you&#39;re using executive

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.078
Caption: thinking here and the more you engage

00:14:49.278 --> 00:14:53.838
Caption: that the less you engage your amygdala

00:14:52.078 --> 00:14:56.320
Caption: so that&#39;s what you want to do in terms

00:14:53.838 --> 00:14:57.919
Caption: of being in a challenging conversation

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.359
Caption: if you&#39;re the one delivering that

00:14:57.919 --> 00:15:01.760
Caption: conversation

00:14:59.359 --> 00:15:05.119
Caption: if you want to have that in a logical

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:07.359
Caption: empathetic way you need to label going

00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:08.159
Caption: into that stress response

00:15:07.359 --> 00:15:09.919
Caption: so

00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:13.039
Caption: it really is as simple as that saying to

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:14.799
Caption: your brain stop this is what&#39;s happening

00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:15.679
Caption: and then the last one here is take a

00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:18.159
Caption: break

00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:20.719
Caption: so it takes about

00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:22.799
Caption: 20 to 30 minutes for individuals to get

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:24.838
Caption: out of an acute stress response

00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:27.679
Caption: so if someone is showing all of these

00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:28.958
Caption: signs breathing&#39;s not working labeling

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:31.039
Caption: it&#39;s not working

00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:32.799
Caption: 20 to 30 minute break is what you need

00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:34.398
Caption: to do to get back to a productive

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:36.559
Caption: conversation

00:15:34.398 --> 00:15:39.440
Caption: how i like to word this to make the

00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:39.440
Caption: individual feel

00:15:39.518 --> 00:15:44.078
Caption: you know less stressed and intimidated

00:15:41.518 --> 00:15:45.518
Caption: about the situation is i like to say you

00:15:44.078 --> 00:15:47.039
Caption: know what i think i need a 20 to 30

00:15:45.518 --> 00:15:48.719
Caption: minute break here

00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:50.320
Caption: i think this is a heavy conversation and

00:15:48.719 --> 00:15:52.479
Caption: let&#39;s just kind of reconvene in 20

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.239
Caption: minutes and that&#39;s what i do if i start

00:15:52.479 --> 00:15:56.719
Caption: to see individuals really going into

00:15:54.239 --> 00:15:59.440
Caption: this fight or flight mode

00:15:56.719 --> 00:16:01.838
Caption: what i&#39;m hoping is

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.758
Caption: with some of the tips today with the

00:16:01.838 --> 00:16:07.599
Caption: framework with the models

00:16:03.758 --> 00:16:10.000
Caption: we can reduce the effects of this

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:12.479
Caption: and another huge way to reduce it is

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.838
Caption: understanding the power of our wording

00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:15.198
Caption: so you know going to a challenging

00:16:13.838 --> 00:16:18.239
Caption: conversation

00:16:15.198 --> 00:16:21.039
Caption: rephrasing really simple things

00:16:18.239 --> 00:16:22.559
Caption: is going to have a huge effect on

00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:24.159
Caption: whether or not someone goes into fight

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:26.239
Caption: or flight

00:16:24.159 --> 00:16:28.398
Caption: so let&#39;s look at the power of positive

00:16:26.239 --> 00:16:30.559
Caption: wording and what you can do so we&#39;ve got

00:16:28.398 --> 00:16:32.719
Caption: rephrasing this is something that i use

00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:35.758
Caption: all the time in terms of coaching a lot

00:16:32.719 --> 00:16:38.638
Caption: of leaders and this is rephrasing a

00:16:35.758 --> 00:16:40.719
Caption: situation so rephrasing from a person to

00:16:38.638 --> 00:16:43.440
Caption: a situation so let&#39;s look at this

00:16:40.719 --> 00:16:45.039
Caption: example here it&#39;s exactly the same thing

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.039
Caption: and the same message just said in a

00:16:45.039 --> 00:16:49.198
Caption: different way so if you&#39;re talking about

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:50.479
Caption: the person you would say things like you

00:16:49.198 --> 00:16:52.479
Caption: didn&#39;t

00:16:50.479 --> 00:16:54.719
Caption: um support the business case with enough

00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:56.799
Caption: evidence so you and you&#39;re already kind

00:16:54.719 --> 00:16:59.278
Caption: of making that person feel individually

00:16:56.799 --> 00:17:01.278
Caption: kind of uncomfortable and attacked

00:16:59.278 --> 00:17:04.239
Caption: if you reworded that to

00:17:01.278 --> 00:17:06.798
Caption: this business case could be stronger

00:17:04.239 --> 00:17:08.640
Caption: with more recent research to strengthen

00:17:06.798 --> 00:17:11.038
Caption: the likelihood of approval

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.438
Caption: you are saying the same thing but you&#39;re

00:17:11.038 --> 00:17:15.678
Caption: making it specific to the situation

00:17:13.438 --> 00:17:17.119
Caption: versus to them as an individual

00:17:15.678 --> 00:17:19.519
Caption: so if you want to go and get a better

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:22.000
Caption: result this is how you would word it

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.719
Caption: you can also use what-if statements

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.719
Caption: they&#39;re really great in terms of let&#39;s

00:17:24.719 --> 00:17:29.119
Caption: use this as an example

00:17:26.719 --> 00:17:30.880
Caption: what if we used more research

00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:32.719
Caption: to get a better outcome for this

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.319
Caption: business case

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:35.439
Caption: it&#39;s just a different way of waiting

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:38.639
Caption: things

00:17:35.439 --> 00:17:38.639
Caption: to get a better outcome

00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:43.839
Caption: the power of wording in a negative sense

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.760
Caption: so

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:47.678
Caption: i like these some of these are really

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.880
Caption: obvious but i hear them all the time and

00:17:47.678 --> 00:17:52.640
Caption: i just want to explain um why they might

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.440
Caption: be best avoided and the reason i say

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.880
Caption: might is it&#39;s depending on the context

00:17:55.439 --> 00:18:01.599
Caption: the situation i&#39;m also not the knower

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.558
Caption: of all things challenging conversations

00:18:01.599 --> 00:18:04.160
Caption: and

00:18:02.558 --> 00:18:07.279
Caption: negative wording

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:09.520
Caption: but things like to be honest

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.440
Caption: this does a few things it implies that

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.359
Caption: you weren&#39;t honest in the first place

00:18:11.439 --> 00:18:15.279
Caption: which is not a great thing to do

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:17.520
Caption: but it also i mean i don&#39;t know if

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.919
Caption: anyone in this room has ever heard

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.599
Caption: to be honest and then something positive

00:18:19.918 --> 00:18:23.678
Caption: it&#39;s usually

00:18:21.599 --> 00:18:25.359
Caption: followed you know a precursor to

00:18:23.678 --> 00:18:27.359
Caption: something negative

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:29.439
Caption: so when someone hears the words to be

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:31.280
Caption: honest their brain starts to release

00:18:29.439 --> 00:18:34.000
Caption: those hormones because they know

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.160
Caption: something negative is going to happen

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.439
Caption: so avoiding that is probably best in

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.679
Caption: terms of that fight-or-flight response

00:18:39.439 --> 00:18:43.678
Caption: you&#39;re awesome but

00:18:41.678 --> 00:18:45.519
Caption: so the word but

00:18:43.678 --> 00:18:47.599
Caption: there is some research out there that

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.959
Caption: suggests that we negate the phrase

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:50.798
Caption: before but

00:18:48.959 --> 00:18:52.798
Caption: so what i mean by that is if you used

00:18:50.798 --> 00:18:54.880
Caption: this for example

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:57.119
Caption: the business case

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.359
Caption: could be stronger with more research

00:18:57.119 --> 00:19:00.880
Caption: but you&#39;re awesome

00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:03.280
Caption: some research suggests that all people

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.959
Caption: are going to hear is you&#39;re awesome and

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.719
Caption: they&#39;re going to miss that juicy part

00:19:04.959 --> 00:19:08.079
Caption: about adding more research into the

00:19:06.719 --> 00:19:10.798
Caption: business case

00:19:08.079 --> 00:19:13.599
Caption: so that&#39;s one that you is

00:19:10.798 --> 00:19:16.479
Caption: best to avoid if you can

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:17.439
Caption: if i were you this one to me i just feel

00:19:16.479 --> 00:19:18.880
Caption: as though

00:19:17.439 --> 00:19:21.038
Caption: you&#39;re not them

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.160
Caption: that&#39;s the simple fact you&#39;re not that

00:19:21.038 --> 00:19:24.000
Caption: individual

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.520
Caption: and also can come across slightly

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.359
Caption: patronizing because you&#39;re saying if i

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.719
Caption: was if i were you because i&#39;m better

00:19:27.359 --> 00:19:32.719
Caption: clearly is i&#39;m wiping the mic on it um

00:19:30.719 --> 00:19:34.798
Caption: if i were you

00:19:32.719 --> 00:19:37.439
Caption: because i&#39;m better than you that is it&#39;s

00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:39.678
Caption: just not a nice feeling um what i like

00:19:37.439 --> 00:19:41.759
Caption: to use instead of if i were you was

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:43.839
Caption: in the past i have done this and that

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.079
Caption: really helped me and that&#39;s just like a

00:19:43.839 --> 00:19:48.880
Caption: nice suggestion versus saying this is

00:19:46.079 --> 00:19:51.599
Caption: what i&#39;ve done because i&#39;m better

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.520
Caption: no offense i think this one should just

00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:56.239
Caption: be completely avoided

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.919
Caption: because if you have to say no offense

00:19:56.239 --> 00:20:00.160
Caption: you should perhaps question why what

00:19:57.918 --> 00:20:01.759
Caption: you&#39;re about to say is offensive

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.520
Caption: so avoiding this one is my

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.599
Caption: recommendation

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.760
Caption: um i don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever been followed

00:20:05.599 --> 00:20:11.439
Caption: with something positive i&#39;ve never heard

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.798
Caption: no offense you&#39;re awesome it&#39;s usually

00:20:11.439 --> 00:20:14.959
Caption: followed by something relatively

00:20:12.798 --> 00:20:16.558
Caption: negative and as soon as someone hears

00:20:14.959 --> 00:20:18.000
Caption: this phrase

00:20:16.558 --> 00:20:19.279
Caption: again those hormones are going to start

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.119
Caption: to be released

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.880
Caption: so the power of wording is really really

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:25.760
Caption: huge in terms of consideration for

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.119
Caption: challenging conversations

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.599
Caption: i&#39;m going to go through a few more

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:32.319
Caption: considerations in terms of

00:20:29.599 --> 00:20:35.119
Caption: coming out of them with more success

00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:36.719
Caption: so firstly we&#39;ve got time

00:20:35.119 --> 00:20:38.239
Caption: and this is where you need to consider

00:20:36.719 --> 00:20:40.558
Caption: your best time for a challenging

00:20:38.239 --> 00:20:42.239
Caption: conversation there&#39;s some research that

00:20:40.558 --> 00:20:44.158
Caption: suggests um

00:20:42.239 --> 00:20:46.319
Caption: your prefrontal cortex is fresher in the

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:49.840
Caption: morning we start to lose the ability to

00:20:46.319 --> 00:20:50.719
Caption: inhibit emotions as the day goes on

00:20:49.839 --> 00:20:53.359
Caption: i

00:20:50.719 --> 00:20:54.959
Caption: am not a morning person so that is um

00:20:53.359 --> 00:20:57.520
Caption: although there&#39;s a lot of research out

00:20:54.959 --> 00:20:59.359
Caption: there that suggests so um i swear my

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.400
Caption: prefrontal cortex like i&#39;m on point at

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:03.678
Caption: about

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:06.080
Caption: 11 a.m so that was probably when i will

00:21:03.678 --> 00:21:08.000
Caption: start to book in these meetings

00:21:06.079 --> 00:21:09.199
Caption: their schedule now what i mean by this

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.280
Caption: is if you&#39;re about to have a

00:21:09.199 --> 00:21:13.599
Caption: conversation with an individual and

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:16.000
Caption: they&#39;re then going to go into a client

00:21:13.599 --> 00:21:17.359
Caption: meeting for a presentation or if someone

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.599
Caption: had some feedback from me and they told

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:22.558
Caption: me just before my d2d talk it&#39;s like

00:21:19.599 --> 00:21:24.239
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s probably not the best time

00:21:22.558 --> 00:21:26.479
Caption: and that is because as i said before

00:21:24.239 --> 00:21:27.599
Caption: that 20 to 30 minute window for fight or

00:21:26.479 --> 00:21:29.119
Caption: flight

00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:31.280
Caption: if you walk away from a challenging

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:33.280
Caption: conversation even if you use the

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:35.520
Caption: frameworks and you nail it

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.960
Caption: there is an element of stress involved

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.320
Caption: and so you want to really consider their

00:21:36.959 --> 00:21:40.079
Caption: schedule

00:21:38.319 --> 00:21:41.519
Caption: you want to set enough time and again

00:21:40.079 --> 00:21:43.839
Caption: that brings it back to that 20 to 30

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.359
Caption: minute break or needing to breathe and

00:21:43.839 --> 00:21:47.119
Caption: have some pauses

00:21:45.359 --> 00:21:48.719
Caption: so don&#39;t try and squeeze in a

00:21:47.119 --> 00:21:50.798
Caption: conversation for half an hour because

00:21:48.719 --> 00:21:52.719
Caption: that&#39;s the only time for the day

00:21:50.798 --> 00:21:54.079
Caption: consider another day that has more time

00:21:52.719 --> 00:21:55.280
Caption: in it for you

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:56.719
Caption: and then the biggest question i get

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.919
Caption: asked a lot when i do some coaching

00:21:56.719 --> 00:22:01.199
Caption: around this topic is are fridays okay

00:21:59.918 --> 00:22:03.759
Caption: and

00:22:01.199 --> 00:22:06.079
Caption: i personally think so if you do them

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.760
Caption: well what i don&#39;t think is great is when

00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:10.239
Caption: you send someone that blank agenda for a

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.880
Caption: monday on a friday that&#39;s

00:22:10.239 --> 00:22:15.038
Caption: that&#39;s where i recommend you reconsider

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.280
Caption: but i think if you can

00:22:15.038 --> 00:22:18.479
Caption: do this well and with empathy and

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.919
Caption: kindness

00:22:18.479 --> 00:22:22.880
Caption: i don&#39;t think it matters what day you

00:22:19.918 --> 00:22:22.880
Caption: have these conversations

00:22:23.119 --> 00:22:28.798
Caption: we have location

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.239
Caption: off-site versus on-site what i mean by

00:22:28.798 --> 00:22:32.719
Caption: this one here is

00:22:30.239 --> 00:22:35.038
Caption: i&#39;ve had a few um individuals that i&#39;ve

00:22:32.719 --> 00:22:36.880
Caption: had to speak to around they&#39;ve come to

00:22:35.038 --> 00:22:39.119
Caption: me and said hey shiv i had a meeting

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.479
Caption: with someone so at the pub on friday and

00:22:39.119 --> 00:22:42.158
Caption: it went terribly

00:22:40.479 --> 00:22:44.079
Caption: and that is because

00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:46.080
Caption: from multitude of factors around you

00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:49.038
Caption: know how they handled the conversation

00:22:46.079 --> 00:22:50.479
Caption: but if you add alcohol into the mix you

00:22:49.038 --> 00:22:53.119
Caption: know we know what that already does to

00:22:50.479 --> 00:22:54.479
Caption: the brain in terms of inhibiting logic

00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:55.520
Caption: and things like that

00:22:54.479 --> 00:22:59.199
Caption: and so

00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.799
Caption: my advice is to avoid the pub setting um

00:22:59.199 --> 00:23:02.319
Caption: cafe all those sort of things depending

00:23:00.798 --> 00:23:04.639
Caption: on the context of the

00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:07.759
Caption: conversation is fine as well

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:10.558
Caption: a walk and talk so this is

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:13.199
Caption: i highly recommend this

00:23:10.558 --> 00:23:14.798
Caption: and that is because when we walk um you

00:23:13.199 --> 00:23:17.038
Caption: know our blood is circulating more we

00:23:14.798 --> 00:23:18.798
Caption: get more oxygen and again all those

00:23:17.038 --> 00:23:21.119
Caption: delicious things for our brain that we

00:23:18.798 --> 00:23:23.038
Caption: need so walk and talks are really proven

00:23:21.119 --> 00:23:25.119
Caption: to have more effective outcomes for

00:23:23.038 --> 00:23:26.879
Caption: challenging conversations

00:23:25.119 --> 00:23:29.280
Caption: and we&#39;ve got room positioning now this

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.520
Caption: one seems a little bit over the top i&#39;m

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.599
Caption: kind of glad i&#39;ve got to show you here

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:36.400
Caption: but what i mean is

00:23:33.599 --> 00:23:38.798
Caption: our brains are scanning for threats

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.839
Caption: every 20 to 30 seconds or you know quite

00:23:38.798 --> 00:23:41.678
Caption: regularly

00:23:39.839 --> 00:23:44.239
Caption: as we&#39;re scanning for threats we&#39;re also

00:23:41.678 --> 00:23:45.359
Caption: scanning for safety we&#39;re scanning for

00:23:44.239 --> 00:23:47.278
Caption: exits

00:23:45.359 --> 00:23:48.959
Caption: so what we&#39;re doing is we walk into a

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:50.480
Caption: room and subconsciously we&#39;re working

00:23:48.959 --> 00:23:52.158
Caption: out where the door is because if

00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:54.719
Caption: something happens out there in that room

00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:56.320
Caption: how do we get out so what i like to do

00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:57.918
Caption: is um

00:23:56.319 --> 00:23:59.918
Caption: i sit someone

00:23:57.918 --> 00:24:02.079
Caption: in a in an office setting

00:23:59.918 --> 00:24:04.239
Caption: next to the door because subconsciously

00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:06.640
Caption: they will they&#39;ll feel safer and they&#39;ll

00:24:04.239 --> 00:24:08.319
Caption: have no idea why again this is little

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.239
Caption: but if we can do all these little things

00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:11.199
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s only going to lead to a better

00:24:10.239 --> 00:24:13.199
Caption: outcome

00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:15.119
Caption: and how i do that so some people are

00:24:13.199 --> 00:24:17.119
Caption: like how do you how do you make someone

00:24:15.119 --> 00:24:19.599
Caption: sit somewhere without being like sit

00:24:17.119 --> 00:24:20.959
Caption: there when they walk in and all i do is

00:24:19.599 --> 00:24:22.959
Caption: i sit

00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:25.038
Caption: a glass of water where i want someone to

00:24:22.959 --> 00:24:26.640
Caption: go and i have my glass of water in front

00:24:25.038 --> 00:24:28.158
Caption: of me

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.440
Caption: i mean there is a few times where if

00:24:28.159 --> 00:24:31.279
Caption: someone&#39;s not thirsty they&#39;ll walk

00:24:29.439 --> 00:24:32.399
Caption: straight past it and that&#39;s that&#39;s cool

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:34.480
Caption: that&#39;s fine

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.679
Caption: um but most of the time that trick has

00:24:34.479 --> 00:24:37.520
Caption: worked for me

00:24:35.678 --> 00:24:38.479
Caption: um trick is probably not the right word

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.839
Caption: as well because you don&#39;t want to trick

00:24:38.479 --> 00:24:43.918
Caption: someone but that tip has worked for me

00:24:41.839 --> 00:24:45.359
Caption: um and that&#39;s just a really it&#39;s a small

00:24:43.918 --> 00:24:47.839
Caption: thing that you can do to help those

00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:47.839
Caption: individuals

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:51.519
Caption: what i&#39;m saying just in summary to this

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.239
Caption: one here is you just want them to be in

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.440
Caption: a comfortable safe environment you

00:24:54.239 --> 00:24:56.400
Caption: really want to make sure that that

00:24:55.439 --> 00:24:57.278
Caption: person

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.599
Caption: has

00:24:57.279 --> 00:25:02.159
Caption: limited or reduced stress in terms of

00:24:59.599 --> 00:25:04.158
Caption: the environment you choose because if

00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:05.440
Caption: it&#39;s a hard conversation there is

00:25:04.159 --> 00:25:07.919
Caption: already going to be elements of stress

00:25:05.439 --> 00:25:07.918
Caption: involved

00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:12.158
Caption: the medium and what i mean by this you

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.200
Caption: know we&#39;ve got teams we&#39;ve got zoom

00:25:12.159 --> 00:25:16.960
Caption: we&#39;ve got face-to-face

00:25:15.199 --> 00:25:18.399
Caption: my recommendation is always face to face

00:25:16.959 --> 00:25:20.798
Caption: and that&#39;s because

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:23.119
Caption: some research suggests anything from 70

00:25:20.798 --> 00:25:26.079
Caption: to 80 of conversations

00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:28.079
Caption: are non-verbal and that&#39;s body language

00:25:26.079 --> 00:25:30.079
Caption: and also we&#39;ve just gone through all of

00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:32.798
Caption: the fight or flight responses most of

00:25:30.079 --> 00:25:35.439
Caption: those are visible unless it&#39;s yourself

00:25:32.798 --> 00:25:37.439
Caption: so you can&#39;t tell if you need to back up

00:25:35.439 --> 00:25:38.399
Caption: from a conversation if it&#39;s not face to

00:25:37.439 --> 00:25:40.239
Caption: face

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.159
Caption: for example in the talk today if it

00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:43.760
Caption: wasn&#39;t face to face i couldn&#39;t tell if

00:25:42.159 --> 00:25:45.600
Caption: some of you were kind of nodding off and

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.520
Caption: falling asleep and if that was the case

00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:50.558
Caption: i would spend less time and kind of

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:53.119
Caption: pivot to another topic

00:25:50.558 --> 00:25:54.479
Caption: we&#39;re in a day and age where

00:25:53.119 --> 00:25:56.640
Caption: video calls

00:25:54.479 --> 00:25:58.798
Caption: you know it&#39;s remote working and that&#39;s

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.400
Caption: fantastic and that&#39;s what i mean by

00:25:58.798 --> 00:26:03.038
Caption: face-to-face would be recommending a

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:05.679
Caption: video call over that phone call

00:26:03.038 --> 00:26:06.719
Caption: and do not disturb you know team zoom

00:26:05.678 --> 00:26:08.719
Caption: whatever

00:26:06.719 --> 00:26:10.558
Caption: you choose to use has those do not

00:26:08.719 --> 00:26:12.640
Caption: disturb features and i think that&#39;s

00:26:10.558 --> 00:26:13.439
Caption: really important to use or if you&#39;re in

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.678
Caption: a

00:26:13.439 --> 00:26:17.839
Caption: meeting room making sure it&#39;s booked you

00:26:15.678 --> 00:26:19.839
Caption: there is nothing worse when someone is

00:26:17.839 --> 00:26:22.640
Caption: flustered in a conversation and then you

00:26:19.839 --> 00:26:24.239
Caption: know people just like waltz on in um

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.799
Caption: if you can avoid it that would that&#39;s

00:26:24.239 --> 00:26:26.798
Caption: the ideal

00:26:27.439 --> 00:26:31.038
Caption: your mindset so this is really important

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.839
Caption: because if your resilience levels are

00:26:31.038 --> 00:26:34.479
Caption: low

00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:36.558
Caption: um and you go into a conversation there

00:26:34.479 --> 00:26:37.918
Caption: is a lot that contribute to that

00:26:36.558 --> 00:26:39.278
Caption: conversation going straight into that

00:26:37.918 --> 00:26:41.199
Caption: fight or flight mode so if you&#39;re

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:43.360
Caption: feeling stressed already i wouldn&#39;t

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:46.479
Caption: recommend going to these conversations i

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:48.640
Caption: would wait a day if you could

00:26:46.479 --> 00:26:51.520
Caption: sleep on it and this is where checking

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.039
Caption: your intention is really important so i

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.000
Caption: have a lot of leaders that come to me

00:26:53.038 --> 00:26:55.439
Caption: and say

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.159
Caption: um

00:26:55.439 --> 00:27:00.319
Caption: so-and-so did this and i&#39;m raging i&#39;m so

00:26:58.159 --> 00:27:01.440
Caption: mad at them and i want to like i want to

00:27:00.319 --> 00:27:02.639
Caption: tell them that they&#39;ve done something

00:27:01.439 --> 00:27:04.719
Caption: wrong and i want to give them into

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.799
Caption: trouble and i&#39;m like oh this is not

00:27:04.719 --> 00:27:08.719
Caption: going to go well

00:27:06.798 --> 00:27:09.839
Caption: i i ask them to reflect and change their

00:27:08.719 --> 00:27:11.520
Caption: intention

00:27:09.839 --> 00:27:13.119
Caption: instead of saying x to this and i want

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.839
Caption: to give them into trouble which i don&#39;t

00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:17.918
Caption: think is healthy language anyway um go

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:20.398
Caption: in and say x did this and i&#39;m curious as

00:27:17.918 --> 00:27:22.158
Caption: to why it&#39;s out of character for them

00:27:20.399 --> 00:27:24.320
Caption: why did they do this

00:27:22.159 --> 00:27:26.240
Caption: if you think about it the majority of

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:27.678
Caption: people when i say majority

00:27:26.239 --> 00:27:28.798
Caption: because some people don&#39;t but most

00:27:27.678 --> 00:27:31.839
Caption: people

00:27:28.798 --> 00:27:34.719
Caption: go to work wanting to do a good job

00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:37.038
Caption: so when someone does something that is

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:38.880
Caption: not so great it&#39;s it&#39;s either they

00:27:37.038 --> 00:27:40.239
Caption: haven&#39;t um

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.359
Caption: thought about it they haven&#39;t perceived

00:27:40.239 --> 00:27:43.599
Caption: the other views they haven&#39;t thought

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:45.599
Caption: about their impact so going into it with

00:27:43.599 --> 00:27:47.520
Caption: a curious mindset will really change the

00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:49.760
Caption: outcome of the conversation and the

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.640
Caption: reason i say work setting here is you&#39;ll

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.640
Caption: be getting the vibe but this is more the

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.760
Caption: talk today is centered around

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.359
Caption: challenging conversations in the

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.959
Caption: workplace

00:27:57.359 --> 00:28:01.199
Caption: i have tested

00:27:58.959 --> 00:28:02.959
Caption: the framework with my husband

00:28:01.199 --> 00:28:04.719
Caption: he knew i was doing it so it didn&#39;t go

00:28:02.959 --> 00:28:07.439
Caption: so well

00:28:04.719 --> 00:28:09.520
Caption: teeny bit patronizing but

00:28:07.439 --> 00:28:11.359
Caption: it worked on my children so

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.839
Caption: because they had no idea

00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:15.520
Caption: so you can use it in a personal setting

00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:18.319
Caption: but today is more around that

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.159
Caption: professional environment

00:28:18.319 --> 00:28:22.158
Caption: and lastly we&#39;ve got preparation and

00:28:20.159 --> 00:28:23.760
Caption: this is where you need cold hard facts

00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:25.360
Caption: you need to know the facts about what

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.479
Caption: you&#39;re walking into you won&#39;t know all

00:28:25.359 --> 00:28:28.239
Caption: of them because you still need to get

00:28:26.479 --> 00:28:29.678
Caption: that from the individual

00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:31.119
Caption: and this is where the framework will

00:28:29.678 --> 00:28:33.839
Caption: help so i&#39;m going to go through that for

00:28:31.119 --> 00:28:33.839
Caption: you now

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:40.719
Caption: ah this is to remind me thank you um

00:28:39.119 --> 00:28:42.000
Caption: there is a few things though to consider

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:43.678
Caption: in terms of having challenging

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.079
Caption: conversations and that is to understand

00:28:43.678 --> 00:28:47.678
Caption: the power of silence

00:28:46.079 --> 00:28:49.519
Caption: there is a lot of

00:28:47.678 --> 00:28:52.000
Caption: research out there around extrovert

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:55.039
Caption: versus introvert personality types and

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.479
Caption: how we intake information so for example

00:28:55.038 --> 00:28:59.918
Caption: and generalizing here because it&#39;s not

00:28:56.479 --> 00:29:02.239
Caption: always the case introverts often need

00:28:59.918 --> 00:29:03.439
Caption: that moment to pause and reflect before

00:29:02.239 --> 00:29:05.520
Caption: speaking

00:29:03.439 --> 00:29:07.759
Caption: versus extroverts finding that silence

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.760
Caption: uncomfortable and talking over it so if

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.558
Caption: you&#39;re in a challenging conversation

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.959
Caption: really pausing not only because that

00:29:12.558 --> 00:29:16.959
Caption: pause will help the individual respond

00:29:14.959 --> 00:29:18.479
Caption: better but also that gives you a moment

00:29:16.959 --> 00:29:20.319
Caption: to breathe it gives you a moment to

00:29:18.479 --> 00:29:21.839
Caption: chill for a second and we all know how

00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:23.599
Caption: that you know important that is for our

00:29:21.839 --> 00:29:26.000
Caption: brains

00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:28.640
Caption: the reflection piece now this is because

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.798
Caption: i&#39;ve had even in personal situations

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.399
Caption: where um you know you&#39;ve walked away and

00:29:30.798 --> 00:29:34.479
Caption: gone that person wasn&#39;t even listening

00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:36.880
Caption: to me well they were really irrational

00:29:34.479 --> 00:29:38.719
Caption: and not being logical at all

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.479
Caption: give them some time because they&#39;ve

00:29:38.719 --> 00:29:41.439
Caption: probably gone into fight or flight at

00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:43.520
Caption: this

00:29:41.439 --> 00:29:45.519
Caption: point something you said something&#39;s

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.399
Caption: triggered them whatever has happened i

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.159
Caption: mean

00:29:46.399 --> 00:29:49.760
Caption: i recommend these frameworks and i still

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:52.320
Caption: go into these conversations sometimes

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:54.719
Caption: and emotions take over and i don&#39;t do

00:29:52.319 --> 00:29:56.319
Caption: them as well as i&#39;d hope so give them

00:29:54.719 --> 00:29:58.319
Caption: some time to reflect because a lot of

00:29:56.319 --> 00:30:00.719
Caption: the time people will come back

00:29:58.319 --> 00:30:01.678
Caption: think in more of that logical brain of

00:30:00.719 --> 00:30:02.880
Caption: theirs

00:30:01.678 --> 00:30:04.319
Caption: and come back and be like you know what

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.319
Caption: you&#39;re right

00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:08.639
Caption: and so giving that time for them to

00:30:06.319 --> 00:30:10.000
Caption: reflect is really important and also

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.919
Caption: follow-up so i&#39;m going to give you this

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.279
Caption: framework but if you leave it at that

00:30:11.918 --> 00:30:15.599
Caption: and you just kind of

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:17.039
Caption: walk away

00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:18.479
Caption: you need to follow up you need to check

00:30:17.038 --> 00:30:20.239
Caption: in with that individual and that&#39;s a

00:30:18.479 --> 00:30:22.000
Caption: really important element of this

00:30:20.239 --> 00:30:24.880
Caption: framework

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.520
Caption: also importantly is knowing again my

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.760
Caption: amazing clipper i had a lot of fun doing

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.320
Caption: this um i had to tone down the

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.640
Caption: animations there was a lot but what i&#39;m

00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:36.639
Caption: saying here is it&#39;s not a script

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.479
Caption: so the framework i&#39;m about to propose is

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.440
Caption: not a script to hide behind and that is

00:30:38.479 --> 00:30:40.640
Caption: because

00:30:39.439 --> 00:30:43.359
Caption: we humans

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.640
Caption: um react with uncertainty we don&#39;t know

00:30:43.359 --> 00:30:46.398
Caption: how it&#39;s going to go

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.520
Caption: so how i recommend this framework is to

00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:52.080
Caption: use it as a repertoire of responses like

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:54.558
Caption: what could happen um and i&#39;m going to go

00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:56.798
Caption: through one that i have written before

00:30:54.558 --> 00:30:58.398
Caption: and um you know versus going in and

00:30:56.798 --> 00:31:00.479
Caption: saying like reading from a script that&#39;s

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:03.279
Caption: disingenuine and it&#39;s it&#39;s obvious when

00:31:00.479 --> 00:31:04.880
Caption: you&#39;re doing it as well

00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:06.559
Caption: so let&#39;s go through the framework you&#39;d

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.839
Caption: see the puzzle theme going on here to

00:31:06.558 --> 00:31:09.918
Caption: get it

00:31:07.839 --> 00:31:12.398
Caption: again i had too much fun uh so the

00:31:09.918 --> 00:31:15.599
Caption: intent this is where you start off in

00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:16.480
Caption: the meeting and or the conversation and

00:31:15.599 --> 00:31:17.918
Caption: say

00:31:16.479 --> 00:31:19.599
Caption: what the intent is and this is where you

00:31:17.918 --> 00:31:21.759
Caption: have to be really genuine

00:31:19.599 --> 00:31:23.359
Caption: and go you know

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.640
Caption: today i want to have talk to you about

00:31:23.359 --> 00:31:26.558
Caption: feedback and get your perspective and

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.039
Caption: that&#39;s the intent today

00:31:26.558 --> 00:31:32.398
Caption: um it really sets the tone for the

00:31:29.038 --> 00:31:33.918
Caption: remainder of the conversation

00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:35.119
Caption: feedback so this is where you use a

00:31:33.918 --> 00:31:36.398
Caption: feedback model and i&#39;m going to go

00:31:35.119 --> 00:31:37.918
Caption: through those in a second so i&#39;m just

00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:39.279
Caption: going to leave that lovely little puzzle

00:31:37.918 --> 00:31:42.558
Caption: piece up there for you and we&#39;ll go into

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:43.760
Caption: that in a little bit more detail

00:31:42.558 --> 00:31:44.959
Caption: this is where you check their

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.798
Caption: perspective

00:31:44.959 --> 00:31:48.158
Caption: so you&#39;ve just said this is the intent i

00:31:46.798 --> 00:31:50.079
Caption: want to share some feedback today and

00:31:48.159 --> 00:31:52.000
Caption: get your your perspective

00:31:50.079 --> 00:31:54.558
Caption: this is the feedback what are your

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.479
Caption: thoughts did i accurately

00:31:54.558 --> 00:31:58.640
Caption: describe the situation

00:31:56.479 --> 00:32:00.640
Caption: what is your thoughts on the impact that

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.479
Caption: that&#39;s had so this is the part where you

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.919
Caption: you know you can&#39;t plan for and you

00:32:02.479 --> 00:32:07.119
Caption: really need to just

00:32:03.918 --> 00:32:09.119
Caption: ask really open curious um questions

00:32:07.119 --> 00:32:12.079
Caption: here

00:32:09.119 --> 00:32:13.760
Caption: show understanding so this is when

00:32:12.079 --> 00:32:15.518
Caption: you

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.880
Caption: really have to show that you&#39;ve listened

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:18.399
Caption: and you can do this in a few ways you

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.558
Caption: can repeat what they&#39;ve said because

00:32:18.399 --> 00:32:22.559
Caption: that&#39;s either that&#39;s also confirming

00:32:20.558 --> 00:32:24.079
Caption: that you&#39;ve heard correctly and it&#39;s

00:32:22.558 --> 00:32:25.119
Caption: showing that you&#39;ve actually genuinely

00:32:24.079 --> 00:32:26.798
Caption: listened

00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:28.319
Caption: um and this shows that kind of

00:32:26.798 --> 00:32:29.839
Caption: empathetic side of it because if you

00:32:28.319 --> 00:32:32.000
Caption: just go here&#39;s the feedback here&#39;s your

00:32:29.839 --> 00:32:33.199
Caption: perspective but yeah whatever and keep

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.959
Caption: going

00:32:33.199 --> 00:32:38.639
Caption: what was the point in this section here

00:32:36.959 --> 00:32:40.558
Caption: and then you have hands up and this is

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.678
Caption: what i say to a lot of leaders in

00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:44.158
Caption: particular

00:32:41.678 --> 00:32:46.959
Caption: you need to take ownership for your part

00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:49.440
Caption: in the situation and that could be as a

00:32:46.959 --> 00:32:51.518
Caption: leader for example i often question them

00:32:49.439 --> 00:32:53.599
Caption: and say did you provide enough support

00:32:51.519 --> 00:32:56.000
Caption: for this person were you accessible

00:32:53.599 --> 00:32:58.479
Caption: enough so this is when you say or you

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.319
Caption: ask questions like that did i was i

00:32:58.479 --> 00:33:02.158
Caption: there enough for you when you needed it

00:33:00.319 --> 00:33:04.158
Caption: and just take a little bit of ownership

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:05.760
Caption: as to your part of this potential

00:33:04.159 --> 00:33:07.519
Caption: situation

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.440
Caption: and then lastly

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:11.200
Caption: now you can get to the solution part a

00:33:09.439 --> 00:33:14.000
Caption: lot of people really try and like fit

00:33:11.199 --> 00:33:15.359
Caption: solution in these sections here but you

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.038
Caption: really need to just kind of get through

00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:18.719
Caption: the whole conversation and then

00:33:17.038 --> 00:33:20.959
Caption: collaboratively

00:33:18.719 --> 00:33:23.678
Caption: that word always gets me um

00:33:20.959 --> 00:33:25.119
Caption: discuss a solution together and what are

00:33:23.678 --> 00:33:27.760
Caption: the next steps

00:33:25.119 --> 00:33:29.918
Caption: now if it&#39;s a

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.279
Caption: really performance-based conversation so

00:33:29.918 --> 00:33:32.798
Caption: for example a lot of the ones that i

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:34.720
Caption: would have

00:33:32.798 --> 00:33:35.599
Caption: what i say to people is you need to tell

00:33:34.719 --> 00:33:38.000
Caption: them

00:33:35.599 --> 00:33:39.918
Caption: the next steps very clearly here and

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.439
Caption: that&#39;s because it&#39;s kind to do so so you

00:33:39.918 --> 00:33:43.678
Caption: need to say to them

00:33:41.439 --> 00:33:45.918
Caption: this is an extreme example

00:33:43.678 --> 00:33:46.880
Caption: if we see this situation

00:33:45.918 --> 00:33:49.678
Caption: again

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.279
Caption: there will be a warning down the track

00:33:49.678 --> 00:33:53.599
Caption: and that is you know people are often

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:55.919
Caption: like geez that&#39;s blunt

00:33:53.599 --> 00:33:58.319
Caption: i think that if you don&#39;t tell people

00:33:55.918 --> 00:34:00.398
Caption: what could happen if this happens again

00:33:58.319 --> 00:34:02.479
Caption: and then you give them a warning

00:34:00.399 --> 00:34:04.320
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s such a shock and i don&#39;t think

00:34:02.479 --> 00:34:07.199
Caption: that&#39;s a very kind thing to do so just

00:34:04.319 --> 00:34:08.878
Caption: highlighting the next steps if um from a

00:34:07.199 --> 00:34:10.800
Caption: like severity perspective it&#39;s at that

00:34:08.878 --> 00:34:12.559
Caption: real you know hard performance side of

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.918
Caption: things

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.280
Caption: now what i&#39;m going to do is go into this

00:34:13.918 --> 00:34:19.358
Caption: little feedback section for you okay

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:21.359
Caption: i&#39;m going to rehash that whole framework

00:34:19.358 --> 00:34:23.118
Caption: because i&#39;ve just thrown a lot of words

00:34:21.358 --> 00:34:24.078
Caption: at you on a lot of colorful puzzle

00:34:23.118 --> 00:34:25.439
Caption: pieces

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:28.720
Caption: so we&#39;ll go through these feedback

00:34:25.439 --> 00:34:30.959
Caption: models and then um the framework again

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:32.800
Caption: now this one&#39;s a little controversial

00:34:30.959 --> 00:34:35.520
Caption: the dinosaur has to lie in the mood for

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.040
Caption: it but i think that

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.520
Caption: sandwiches are for eating and they

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.199
Caption: shouldn&#39;t live in the land of feedback

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.119
Caption: and for those that don&#39;t know the

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:45.838
Caption: feedback

00:34:43.118 --> 00:34:47.918
Caption: sandwich model is when you use this

00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:49.280
Caption: delicious bit of bread gluten free or

00:34:47.918 --> 00:34:51.118
Caption: otherwise

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:53.280
Caption: as the compliment so you go in and you

00:34:51.118 --> 00:34:55.279
Caption: start to compliment someone

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.398
Caption: this is where a lot of people spend too

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.280
Caption: much time

00:34:56.398 --> 00:34:58.559
Caption: and

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.400
Caption: often

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.599
Caption: people know you that you&#39;re doing it and

00:35:00.399 --> 00:35:04.319
Caption: i feel as if this model can be a little

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:05.440
Caption: bit patronizing and it can also

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.320
Caption: delay

00:35:05.439 --> 00:35:10.239
Caption: this middle layer this middle layer the

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.160
Caption: cheese lettuce beef whatever whatever

00:35:10.239 --> 00:35:14.000
Caption: you eat whatever you do you

00:35:12.159 --> 00:35:15.358
Caption: this bit is usually the constructive

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.560
Caption: piece of feedback that you want to give

00:35:15.358 --> 00:35:19.838
Caption: this person

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:22.320
Caption: and often they&#39;re just waiting for this

00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:23.760
Caption: and the more you complement and drag

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.520
Caption: that along the more they&#39;re sitting

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.239
Caption: there getting stressed because they&#39;re

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.439
Caption: like what is happening get to the point

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:31.679
Caption: so for the

00:35:29.439 --> 00:35:34.159
Caption: feedback sandwich is complement

00:35:31.679 --> 00:35:35.118
Caption: feedback and then complement again and

00:35:34.159 --> 00:35:38.000
Caption: often people know they&#39;re being

00:35:35.118 --> 00:35:39.760
Caption: sandwiched so my suggestion and some

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.959
Caption: people love this model again this is not

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.959
Caption: for me

00:35:40.959 --> 00:35:45.040
Caption: um i was thinking about another food

00:35:42.959 --> 00:35:47.199
Caption: analogy because i like i love food and

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.320
Caption: this is this is a food analogy

00:35:47.199 --> 00:35:52.560
Caption: and so i thought about a pizza

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.400
Caption: why don&#39;t we look at it as get straight

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.199
Caption: to the feedback get the topping this

00:35:54.399 --> 00:35:59.520
Caption: delicious ham cheese topping make that

00:35:57.199 --> 00:36:01.040
Caption: the feedback get straight to it

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.359
Caption: and then the base

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:05.520
Caption: can be instead of a compliment

00:36:03.358 --> 00:36:07.358
Caption: saying what strengths that they have

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:09.040
Caption: that will help solve

00:36:07.358 --> 00:36:11.358
Caption: that that situation that you just

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:13.520
Caption: described so think of it more as a

00:36:11.358 --> 00:36:16.000
Caption: delicious bit of feedback here are your

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:18.399
Caption: strengths that i think will help you

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.719
Caption: move on from this and it&#39;s just i think

00:36:18.399 --> 00:36:22.959
Caption: a little bit more genuine than the over

00:36:20.719 --> 00:36:26.520
Caption: complimenting trying to really pull and

00:36:22.959 --> 00:36:26.520
Caption: drag that out

00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:30.399
Caption: i&#39;m going to be very interested to hear

00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:32.720
Caption: the feedback on the pizza v sandwich

00:36:30.399 --> 00:36:35.118
Caption: now this is the model that i like to use

00:36:32.719 --> 00:36:37.358
Caption: i&#39;m going to show you two models today

00:36:35.118 --> 00:36:38.838
Caption: and this is what&#39;s called the sbi model

00:36:37.358 --> 00:36:42.159
Caption: and this is

00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:44.079
Caption: um proven to reduce

00:36:42.159 --> 00:36:46.799
Caption: the anxiety of the person delivering

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:49.440
Caption: feedback um and reduce the defense

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.760
Caption: defenses of the recipient as well so

00:36:49.439 --> 00:36:53.679
Caption: it&#39;s a really great model

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.439
Caption: i like it because i have a relatively

00:36:53.679 --> 00:36:57.520
Caption: direct personality and so i like to just

00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:59.919
Caption: get to the point there is another model

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.760
Caption: that is slightly

00:36:59.919 --> 00:37:03.598
Caption: more suited to those that would prefer

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.040
Caption: that less direct style

00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:07.440
Caption: so let&#39;s go through it we&#39;ve got the

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.839
Caption: specific part of this model

00:37:07.439 --> 00:37:11.280
Caption: and this is when you say

00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:13.040
Caption: what happened

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.640
Caption: and sorry this is what you say when and

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:17.520
Caption: where it occurred

00:37:14.639 --> 00:37:19.439
Caption: so this isn&#39;t new this should not offend

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.719
Caption: the individual because you&#39;re simply

00:37:19.439 --> 00:37:22.719
Caption: recalling

00:37:20.719 --> 00:37:24.959
Caption: so let&#39;s look at the example here

00:37:22.719 --> 00:37:27.838
Caption: during the project kickoff meeting with

00:37:24.959 --> 00:37:29.598
Caption: xyz on tuesday it&#39;s as simple as that

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:32.000
Caption: you&#39;re just bringing their brains back

00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:34.000
Caption: to what happened sorry when and where

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.599
Caption: whatever you&#39;re talking about happened

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.118
Caption: nothing offensive here behavior and this

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:40.880
Caption: is where you simply describe what was

00:37:39.118 --> 00:37:43.118
Caption: observed you don&#39;t make assumptions

00:37:40.879 --> 00:37:44.479
Caption: about their behavior you don&#39;t say like

00:37:43.118 --> 00:37:45.760
Caption: i saw you do this but it&#39;s probably

00:37:44.479 --> 00:37:48.479
Caption: because you&#39;re a little bit grumpy that

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.880
Caption: day probably in a mood and that is

00:37:48.479 --> 00:37:53.118
Caption: you don&#39;t assume so this is where you

00:37:50.879 --> 00:37:55.118
Caption: just go cold hard facts again

00:37:53.118 --> 00:37:57.279
Caption: and again this should not be offensive

00:37:55.118 --> 00:37:58.959
Caption: because it&#39;s simply recalling what

00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.400
Caption: happened

00:37:58.959 --> 00:38:02.879
Caption: the example here

00:38:00.399 --> 00:38:04.639
Caption: if anyone&#39;s called bob in the audience i

00:38:02.879 --> 00:38:06.000
Caption: always use this name so i apologize i&#39;m

00:38:04.639 --> 00:38:08.000
Caption: not picking on you

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.358
Caption: um if i had a boy it would definitely

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.439
Caption: have been bob

00:38:09.358 --> 00:38:13.279
Caption: you said bob was being lazy with his

00:38:11.439 --> 00:38:14.800
Caption: deliverables and that would and that

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.400
Caption: they would be lucky to achieve the

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.760
Caption: deadline

00:38:16.399 --> 00:38:19.598
Caption: in front of the client this is where

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.359
Caption: this situation happened this is a real

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:23.359
Caption: example

00:38:21.358 --> 00:38:25.279
Caption: and this is recalling you&#39;re just

00:38:23.358 --> 00:38:27.838
Caption: telling them what happened

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.760
Caption: this part here impact is where they&#39;ll

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:31.359
Caption: learn something new and this is where

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.399
Caption: all that delicious growth will hopefully

00:38:31.358 --> 00:38:36.479
Caption: come in so you say to the individual

00:38:34.399 --> 00:38:38.799
Caption: either from your point of view from me i

00:38:36.479 --> 00:38:41.118
Caption: was highlighting the clients and the

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.800
Caption: team implications

00:38:41.118 --> 00:38:45.439
Caption: it was a lot kind of broader than this

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:46.400
Caption: but the impact was this impacts our

00:38:45.439 --> 00:38:47.919
Caption: reputation

00:38:46.399 --> 00:38:50.719
Caption: with the client

00:38:47.919 --> 00:38:51.760
Caption: it um publicly undermines the team

00:38:50.719 --> 00:38:54.000
Caption: members

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:56.159
Caption: and affects the the culture within the

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.560
Caption: the organization as well

00:38:56.159 --> 00:39:00.959
Caption: if you were bob you&#39;d go into it with

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.959
Caption: that personal lens of you made me feel

00:39:00.959 --> 00:39:04.320
Caption: rubbish i felt humiliated it was a

00:39:02.959 --> 00:39:06.320
Caption: horrible feeling

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.320
Caption: and often this resulted in the

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.839
Caption: individual

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.160
Caption: having a bad day

00:39:09.839 --> 00:39:14.239
Caption: clearly but also they just didn&#39;t even

00:39:12.159 --> 00:39:15.760
Caption: think about the impact and when we

00:39:14.239 --> 00:39:17.040
Caption: highlighted it to them they actually

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.639
Caption: thanked us because they were like you

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.679
Caption: know what i was having a bad day i said

00:39:18.639 --> 00:39:24.239
Caption: it i didn&#39;t even think about it i had no

00:39:21.679 --> 00:39:25.358
Caption: idea that the impact was you know what

00:39:24.239 --> 00:39:27.439
Caption: it was

00:39:25.358 --> 00:39:28.799
Caption: and that is a really great model just to

00:39:27.439 --> 00:39:32.879
Caption: get to the point

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:34.640
Caption: but in a kind and really specific way

00:39:32.879 --> 00:39:37.039
Caption: another model

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:40.399
Caption: is the aid model

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:43.599
Caption: and this is where you use action here

00:39:40.399 --> 00:39:46.799
Caption: to describe the situation similar to the

00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:48.720
Caption: other model and the behavior all in one

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:52.800
Caption: so the example here is during the last

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:55.280
Caption: two projects together specifically xny

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.359
Caption: um you asked me to review and provide

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.560
Caption: feedback for

00:39:57.358 --> 00:40:01.039
Caption: zed

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.800
Caption: whatever the day before the deadline so

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.079
Caption: this is action you&#39;re lumping all of it

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.719
Caption: into one

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:08.079
Caption: i like to use this model when someone

00:40:06.719 --> 00:40:10.159
Caption: has done something that personally

00:40:08.079 --> 00:40:11.760
Caption: impacts me i find this model really good

00:40:10.159 --> 00:40:13.280
Caption: to use

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.679
Caption: because you go through the impact so you

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:19.280
Caption: describe the impact

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:21.520
Caption: um of that behavior and situation so as

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:23.760
Caption: a result i had to work over the weekend

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:26.959
Caption: to support you so this is that new bit

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:28.800
Caption: of information for that person

00:40:26.959 --> 00:40:30.879
Caption: then we get to the desired and do part

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.040
Caption: and this is what the sbi

00:40:30.879 --> 00:40:34.399
Caption: doesn&#39;t go into as much detail on

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.079
Caption: and this is why i think it works really

00:40:34.399 --> 00:40:37.760
Caption: well if they&#39;ve affected you as an

00:40:36.079 --> 00:40:39.920
Caption: individual

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.839
Caption: in future if you could loot me in sooner

00:40:39.919 --> 00:40:43.838
Caption: i could provide higher quality feedback

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:46.880
Caption: and be less stressed so it&#39;s a really

00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:49.200
Caption: nice way to bundle up instead of saying

00:40:46.879 --> 00:40:50.399
Caption: hey bob you like

00:40:49.199 --> 00:40:52.479
Caption: you&#39;re you&#39;re crappy you made me work

00:40:50.399 --> 00:40:54.239
Caption: over the weekend like you i it was

00:40:52.479 --> 00:40:56.239
Caption: rubbish whatever you know there are so

00:40:54.239 --> 00:40:57.199
Caption: many ways you could have said this

00:40:56.239 --> 00:40:59.040
Caption: this

00:40:57.199 --> 00:41:00.318
Caption: leaded to a really great conversation

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.520
Caption: with that individual around the fact

00:41:00.319 --> 00:41:03.440
Caption: that they didn&#39;t even think about the

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:05.040
Caption: person having to work over the weekend

00:41:03.439 --> 00:41:06.800
Caption: they made assumptions about that

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.239
Caption: person&#39;s workload and there was a lot of

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.199
Caption: other things involved

00:41:08.239 --> 00:41:13.040
Caption: so a great model to

00:41:11.199 --> 00:41:16.000
Caption: kind of remove any of those assumptions

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.000
Caption: and biases as well

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.920
Caption: so let&#39;s go into the framework now this

00:41:18.639 --> 00:41:22.318
Caption: is a frame

00:41:19.919 --> 00:41:23.760
Caption: the framework that we explained before

00:41:22.319 --> 00:41:25.680
Caption: and this is before something that&#39;s

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.880
Caption: actually happened

00:41:25.679 --> 00:41:28.639
Caption: where i wrote down kind of that

00:41:26.879 --> 00:41:30.559
Caption: repertoire of responses i started to

00:41:28.639 --> 00:41:32.399
Caption: think about questions i could ask and i

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.839
Caption: wrote it down in this framework but what

00:41:32.399 --> 00:41:37.358
Caption: i&#39;m going to do is tell you what

00:41:33.839 --> 00:41:38.880
Caption: actually happened as well

00:41:37.358 --> 00:41:41.679
Caption: so we&#39;ve got

00:41:38.879 --> 00:41:42.879
Caption: the intent section here and this is my

00:41:41.679 --> 00:41:44.879
Caption: last slide i&#39;m going to go through the

00:41:42.879 --> 00:41:46.639
Caption: framework i&#39;ve thrown a lot of models

00:41:44.879 --> 00:41:49.279
Caption: and frameworks at you so i&#39;ll be done

00:41:46.639 --> 00:41:50.959
Caption: after this but we&#39;ve got the intent

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.199
Caption: so in this particular conversation the

00:41:50.959 --> 00:41:54.639
Caption: intent was to share a piece of feedback

00:41:53.199 --> 00:41:57.118
Caption: with that individual

00:41:54.639 --> 00:41:59.919
Caption: and avoid it in future because it had to

00:41:57.118 --> 00:42:01.199
Caption: be avoided what they did was not okay

00:41:59.919 --> 00:42:03.520
Caption: but i also wanted to understand their

00:42:01.199 --> 00:42:06.719
Caption: perspective why did they do what they

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:09.119
Caption: did so how you know you could word that

00:42:06.719 --> 00:42:11.199
Caption: is thanks for your time today i&#39;m going

00:42:09.118 --> 00:42:12.639
Caption: to talk to you about some feedback

00:42:11.199 --> 00:42:14.479
Caption: because i really hope to understand your

00:42:12.639 --> 00:42:16.959
Caption: perspective here and i want to avoid

00:42:14.479 --> 00:42:18.959
Caption: this again in future this is not a

00:42:16.959 --> 00:42:20.479
Caption: threatening start to a conversation it

00:42:18.959 --> 00:42:22.560
Caption: is to the point

00:42:20.479 --> 00:42:23.520
Caption: which you know you could start off with

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.680
Caption: all those

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.280
Caption: you know niceties i&#39;m not saying you

00:42:25.679 --> 00:42:29.838
Caption: know don&#39;t ask them how they are before

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.040
Caption: a conversation um but you know just

00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:34.480
Caption: getting straight to the point is really

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.479
Caption: going to help reduce that anxiety

00:42:34.959 --> 00:42:40.000
Caption: using the feedback model so i as i said

00:42:37.839 --> 00:42:43.520
Caption: lean towards sbi

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.679
Caption: so on july 1999 it wasn&#39;t 99 we&#39;ve time

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.479
Caption: traveled for some reason in my example

00:42:45.679 --> 00:42:51.199
Caption: but um you had a meeting with bob

00:42:48.479 --> 00:42:54.399
Caption: to discuss a project update for client x

00:42:51.199 --> 00:42:55.679
Caption: in an open setting environment you stood

00:42:54.399 --> 00:42:58.239
Caption: over bob

00:42:55.679 --> 00:43:00.000
Caption: and yelled this is absolute rubbish it&#39;s

00:42:58.239 --> 00:43:01.839
Caption: not what i asked for

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.520
Caption: that is not the wording they used i had

00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:04.400
Caption: to really dilute it

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:07.359
Caption: um

00:43:04.399 --> 00:43:08.959
Caption: it was a horribly worded situation

00:43:07.358 --> 00:43:10.959
Caption: then we&#39;re going to the impact so

00:43:08.959 --> 00:43:12.399
Caption: there&#39;s a few ways i wrote a bunch of

00:43:10.959 --> 00:43:13.919
Caption: things that this could potentially

00:43:12.399 --> 00:43:15.358
Caption: impact and depend on how the

00:43:13.919 --> 00:43:17.439
Caption: conversation was going was dependent on

00:43:15.358 --> 00:43:19.358
Caption: what i would use here but you know this

00:43:17.439 --> 00:43:21.760
Caption: impacts psychological safety within the

00:43:19.358 --> 00:43:24.078
Caption: team environment it impacts the culture

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.079
Caption: of the team as well

00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:28.000
Caption: standing over someone is intimidating

00:43:26.079 --> 00:43:29.119
Caption: they needed to know the impact of that

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.520
Caption: posture

00:43:29.118 --> 00:43:32.959
Caption: it&#39;s intimidating it&#39;s threatening it&#39;s

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.520
Caption: not conducive to a successful

00:43:32.959 --> 00:43:36.399
Caption: conversation so there was a multi um a

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.319
Caption: lot

00:43:36.399 --> 00:43:41.838
Caption: of impact that this had and that

00:43:38.319 --> 00:43:43.680
Caption: individual really needed to understand

00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:45.200
Caption: then we go into the perspective

00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:47.040
Caption: so was this an accurate reflection of

00:43:45.199 --> 00:43:48.479
Caption: what happened because at the end of the

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.760
Caption: day i might have only gotten bob&#39;s

00:43:48.479 --> 00:43:51.280
Caption: recollection

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.118
Caption: for context i got bob&#39;s and everyone

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.880
Caption: else in the room&#39;s recollection so i was

00:43:53.118 --> 00:43:57.118
Caption: relatively confident that that is what

00:43:54.879 --> 00:43:58.479
Caption: happened but again

00:43:57.118 --> 00:44:00.479
Caption: as that image showed there could have

00:43:58.479 --> 00:44:02.079
Caption: been an eagle in there that i hadn&#39;t

00:44:00.479 --> 00:44:04.239
Caption: found out about

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:06.000
Caption: so was that an accurate reflection walk

00:44:04.239 --> 00:44:07.358
Caption: me through what you were thinking and

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.919
Caption: feeling now this is where the

00:44:07.358 --> 00:44:11.759
Caption: conversation completely pivoted for me

00:44:09.919 --> 00:44:14.159
Caption: because you&#39;ll see all my responses soon

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:16.159
Caption: as to what i was planning to say

00:44:14.159 --> 00:44:18.239
Caption: but what happened here is we opened up

00:44:16.159 --> 00:44:20.159
Caption: the fact that this individual was

00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:22.319
Caption: experiencing some severe mental health

00:44:20.159 --> 00:44:24.959
Caption: issues so the conversation completely

00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:27.520
Caption: pivoted the person was having not only a

00:44:24.959 --> 00:44:30.479
Caption: rubbish day but a terrible time and they

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:33.040
Caption: completely regretted their reaction they

00:44:30.479 --> 00:44:34.239
Caption: knew what they had done was wrong they

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.760
Caption: had

00:44:34.239 --> 00:44:37.760
Caption: made assumptions about the impact that

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:40.639
Caption: this has had and the severity of the

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.639
Caption: reaction as well

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.520
Caption: so this is where you know you really

00:44:42.399 --> 00:44:44.479
Caption: want to show understanding for that

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.159
Caption: person

00:44:44.479 --> 00:44:47.919
Caption: for this individual you know they knew

00:44:46.159 --> 00:44:49.039
Caption: it was a lapse in judgment and so you

00:44:47.919 --> 00:44:50.879
Caption: know i was like thanks so much for

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:53.199
Caption: sharing your perspective it makes a lot

00:44:50.879 --> 00:44:54.799
Caption: of sense um it sounds like you agree

00:44:53.199 --> 00:44:56.479
Caption: that this was out of character and a

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.760
Caption: lifesaving judgment as well so you&#39;re

00:44:56.479 --> 00:44:59.598
Caption: just really kind of showing that

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.839
Caption: understanding that you&#39;ve heard you know

00:44:59.599 --> 00:45:05.680
Caption: that there was a lapse in their judgment

00:45:02.839 --> 00:45:07.520
Caption: etc is where you put your hand up so you

00:45:05.679 --> 00:45:09.040
Caption: know could the fact that this individual

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.439
Caption: was experiencing mental health issues

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.520
Caption: for for quite a while

00:45:11.439 --> 00:45:14.879
Caption: you know what what did we miss is there

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.719
Caption: something that we could do to help are

00:45:14.879 --> 00:45:19.279
Caption: there working hours too long

00:45:16.719 --> 00:45:20.879
Caption: is there work too stressful what are we

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.159
Caption: doing are they as individuals as an

00:45:20.879 --> 00:45:25.118
Caption: organization

00:45:22.159 --> 00:45:27.199
Caption: to contribute to this situation and this

00:45:25.118 --> 00:45:31.439
Caption: is where you really have to kind of be

00:45:27.199 --> 00:45:33.040
Caption: real and be genuine in this situation

00:45:31.439 --> 00:45:35.040
Caption: and then lastly this is when you go

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:37.119
Caption: through next steps so initially i was

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.160
Caption: going into with the lens of

00:45:37.118 --> 00:45:39.519
Caption: you know we need to put together a

00:45:38.159 --> 00:45:41.598
Caption: professional development plan you know

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.040
Caption: hr brain of me we need to put in a plan

00:45:41.599 --> 00:45:44.480
Caption: for this person because they were a

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.479
Caption: manager

00:45:44.479 --> 00:45:48.639
Caption: to never do this again so you know

00:45:46.479 --> 00:45:50.079
Caption: collaboratively i wanted to discuss some

00:45:48.639 --> 00:45:51.039
Caption: professional development opportunities

00:45:50.079 --> 00:45:53.359
Caption: for them

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:56.239
Caption: do you need to do some coaching and pd

00:45:53.358 --> 00:45:59.039
Caption: around challenging conversations

00:45:56.239 --> 00:46:00.800
Caption: like i have a slide ready for it um do

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.439
Caption: you need to

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.880
Caption: you know go and to speak to managers

00:46:03.439 --> 00:46:06.719
Caption: about situations that they&#39;ve done

00:46:04.879 --> 00:46:09.199
Caption: similar to this before

00:46:06.719 --> 00:46:11.919
Caption: what this actually ended up turning into

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:14.879
Caption: was that they needed to engage with our

00:46:11.919 --> 00:46:17.040
Caption: eop they needed some time off so the

00:46:14.879 --> 00:46:18.159
Caption: solution is that collaborative stage

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.640
Caption: where you know i was saying to the

00:46:18.159 --> 00:46:22.719
Caption: individual what do you need to avoid

00:46:20.639 --> 00:46:24.559
Caption: this in future

00:46:22.719 --> 00:46:26.479
Caption: i did have to highlight the severity of

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.959
Caption: the situation as well which you know

00:46:26.479 --> 00:46:31.118
Caption: when you&#39;re dealing with this individual

00:46:28.959 --> 00:46:32.560
Caption: i was quite close to so i know i could

00:46:31.118 --> 00:46:35.118
Caption: be quite real with

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:37.520
Caption: we can&#39;t see this again and if we do it

00:46:35.118 --> 00:46:39.679
Caption: will go down a more serious track of

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.800
Caption: warnings etc because we just simply

00:46:39.679 --> 00:46:46.000
Caption: can&#39;t have managers reacting this way to

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.280
Caption: peers in in an office setting or in any

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.760
Caption: setting really

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.000
Caption: um but really a lot of the conversation

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.800
Caption: focused on this next step section so

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.879
Caption: this is just an example of how you can

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.560
Caption: use this framework but understanding it

00:46:56.879 --> 00:47:01.039
Caption: would pivot at times as well you need to

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:03.680
Caption: be prepared for that

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:05.599
Caption: so my hope for today

00:47:03.679 --> 00:47:06.879
Caption: after talking at you for close to 40

00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:08.400
Caption: minutes

00:47:06.879 --> 00:47:10.879
Caption: is

00:47:08.399 --> 00:47:13.279
Caption: for my friend who was terrified of

00:47:10.879 --> 00:47:14.799
Caption: challenging conversations i&#39;m hoping

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.280
Caption: that we made them a little less

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.839
Caption: terrifying um give you a little bit more

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.880
Caption: confidence to have these conversations

00:47:19.839 --> 00:47:23.280
Caption: and

00:47:20.879 --> 00:47:24.959
Caption: promote growth as a result and also not

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.319
Caption: damage any relationship that&#39;s really

00:47:24.959 --> 00:47:29.040
Caption: important as well

00:47:26.319 --> 00:47:30.559
Caption: so that is my hope and i am happy to

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:32.559
Caption: take questions

00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:34.079
Caption: um now or afterwards as well but thank

00:47:32.559 --> 00:47:37.239
Caption: you so much for your time

00:47:34.079 --> 00:47:37.239
Caption: thank you
