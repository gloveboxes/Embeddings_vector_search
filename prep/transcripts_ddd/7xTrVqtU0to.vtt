00:00:45.238 --> 00:00:49.619
Caption: talk to you about web accessibility

00:00:47.578 --> 00:00:52.019
Caption: but unfortunately on my flight from

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.939

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.220

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:50.099
Caption: incredibly valuable lessons that I

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.200
Caption: learned from them they taught me about

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.118
Caption: the importance of stories and I wouldn&#39;t

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:57.118

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:09.419
Caption: to meet so many awesome people and it

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.839

Caption: if you want to know more about that you

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.339
Caption: can ask me more but the reason that I&#39;m

00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:34.199
Caption: here speaking to all of you today is

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:36.059
Caption: because I am an accidental accessibility

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.839
Caption: Advocate we&#39;re going to get back to that

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.000
Caption: one

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:40.619

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.878
Caption: sometimes doesn&#39;t I am also a raging

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:50.339
Caption: sports ball fan hence that picture and

00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:53.339
Caption: this being me in Boston Bruins clothing

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:56.339
Caption: that&#39;s a hockey team for the record

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:59.039
Caption: so The Accidental accessibility Advocate

00:02:56.339 --> 00:03:00.479
Caption: bit the last two words of that are very

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:03.238
Caption: easy to understand

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:06.119
Caption: The Accidental is a bit less so and in

00:03:03.238 --> 00:03:08.399
Caption: order to explain that I need to take you

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:10.500
Caption: on a little bit of a tour

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:12.839
Caption: and we are going to start that tour in

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.899
Caption: the UK with this excellent disabled

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:17.458
Caption: toilet which is down the set of stairs

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:19.319
Caption: I don&#39;t know if any of you have ever

00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:22.759
Caption: tried to take a wheelchair down a set of

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.759
Caption: stairs do not recommend

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.940
Caption: over in New Zealand much closer to home

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.919
Caption: we do actually have a ramp to be able to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.658
Caption: get into this building but unfortunately

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.580
Caption: for the poor power chair user who&#39;s

00:03:30.658 --> 00:03:34.139
Caption: currently sitting and staring at it it

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.779
Caption: is blocked off by a couple of large

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.238
Caption: orange traffic cones again if you want

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:41.878
Caption: to get into the building not absolutely

00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:44.580
Caption: conducive to that

00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:46.378
Caption: and finally the place where I could save

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.958
Caption: this talk in the place where I live in

00:03:46.378 --> 00:03:51.899
Caption: Melbourne we have these exalus around

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:53.039
Caption: the place Space Age public toilets if

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:56.039
Caption: you will

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:57.899
Caption: and the reason why these made it into a

00:03:56.039 --> 00:04:00.658
Caption: talk about accidental accessibility

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:03.779
Caption: advocacy is because they have a cleaning

00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:05.819
Caption: cycle which runs and that is indicated

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:07.440
Caption: by a large light which will go on in the

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.479
Caption: cubicle of the toilet

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.220
Caption: there is also a panel in the toilet

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:12.899
Caption: which explains that when the large light

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.878
Caption: goes on you should vacate because it&#39;s

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:19.279
Caption: about to start its cleaning cycle

00:04:14.878 --> 00:04:19.279
Caption: that panel is translated into Braille

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:27.000
Caption: Braille blind people light

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.500
Caption: doesn&#39;t quite compute that

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.139
Caption: so

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.639
Caption: before I get on let&#39;s define a few

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.820
Caption: important terms

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.559
Caption: to begin with disability by the

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.000
Caption: Australian definition is a continuing

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:42.119
Caption: condition which restricts everyday

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.279
Caption: activities A continuing condition means

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:45.899
Caption: that it&#39;s likely to last for six months

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:47.459
Caption: or more the restricting everyday

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:49.320
Caption: activities bit is fairly

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:51.479
Caption: self-explanatory

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.460
Caption: then there&#39;s accessibility and that&#39;s

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.779
Caption: the degree to which an activity can be

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:57.559
Caption: done by everyone

00:04:54.779 --> 00:05:00.299
Caption: now this is not just about disability

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:02.759
Caption: one case study that I like to use here

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:05.759
Caption: is from about December 2009 if anyone

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.259
Caption: remembers hp&#39;s racist webcam where a

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.559
Caption: black gentleman had gone out and bought

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.119
Caption: himself a state-of-the-art HP laptop

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:13.619
Caption: which had a wonderful web camera which

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:16.139
Caption: was supposed to be able to do facial

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:19.139
Caption: recognition except it couldn&#39;t until he

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.720
Caption: got his white co-worker to test it

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.460
Caption: and then there&#39;s adaptive technology and

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.380
Caption: those are tools that disabled people to

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:28.440
Caption: use to improve access

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.559
Caption: that can be exceptionally low-tech this

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.899
Caption: my walking stick is a piece of adaptive

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:36.179
Caption: technology wheelchairs are adaptive

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:38.160
Caption: technology some things that we use in

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:40.199
Caption: architecture like ramps can be part of

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.539
Caption: adaptive technology

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.459
Caption: but in the broader sense in terms of

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.320
Caption: technical pieces of adaptive technology

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:48.539
Caption: we&#39;re talking here about things like

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.880
Caption: screen readers things like adaptive and

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.160
Caption: augmentative communication things which

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.739
Caption: are essentially attached to a computer

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.580
Caption: and warning this is where we get

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:58.579
Caption: political for a minute

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.259
Caption: excuse me

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:06.839
Caption: as I get back to the right slide

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.940
Caption: there are broadly two different ways

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:11.220
Caption: that we can Define disability the

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.440
Caption: medical model and the social model

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.959
Caption: the medical model of disability holds

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.519
Caption: that disability itself is a problem that

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:19.259
Caption: disability is something that we should

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:21.599
Caption: try to resolve something that we should

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.339
Caption: try to cure and that is Illustrated here

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.839
Caption: by this clipart lob in a wheelchair

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:27.299
Caption: being comforted by a vaguely

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:29.699
Caption: doctor-looking clipart blob

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:31.500
Caption: on the other hand the social model holds

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.959
Caption: that it&#39;s not so much disability that&#39;s

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.940
Caption: the problem it&#39;s accessibility that we

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:37.259
Caption: shouldn&#39;t be trying to change people we

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.819
Caption: should be trying to change the world

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.399
Caption: around them to make it easier to

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.079
Caption: navigate and when that goes well that&#39;s

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:45.299
Caption: illustrated by things like adaptive

00:06:43.079 --> 00:06:47.099
Caption: sports that we have over here you know

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:49.918
Caption: these people who are playing sports in

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.720
Caption: wheelchairs look perfectly happy doing

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:53.699
Caption: and I wouldn&#39;t want to dismiss the

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.199
Caption: medical model entirely because there are

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:57.660
Caption: some great interventions that have come

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:59.699
Caption: out of that but for the purposes of the

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.139
Caption: work that we&#39;re doing the way that I

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:03.419
Caption: would suggest that we look at this is

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:06.179
Caption: through the lens of the social model we

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.880
Caption: want to try to modify the environment to

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:10.859
Caption: make it easier for people to use

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.839
Caption: and if you&#39;re here I feel pretty

00:07:10.859 --> 00:07:14.279
Caption: confident in saying that this is part of

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:16.380
Caption: your job

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:18.299
Caption: so to illustrate that let&#39;s look at a

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.399
Caption: few case studies of how this goes well

00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:23.220
Caption: and how this goes badly

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:25.799
Caption: this is on grand.net and I didn&#39;t have

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.319
Caption: to look very hard to find this it&#39;s on a

00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:29.220
Caption: great many list of top 10 worst websites

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:32.098
Caption: ever

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.779
Caption: and it&#39;s visually very cluttered you can

00:07:32.098 --> 00:07:35.639
Caption: see that I mean it would probably make

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:37.979
Caption: more sense to me if I spoke Norwegian

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:39.899
Caption: but you&#39;ve got a bunch of pictures here

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:41.639
Caption: which are all very confused you&#39;ve got a

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:43.799
Caption: bunch of colors there&#39;s not really a

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:45.960
Caption: whole lot of structure to it and it

00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:48.059
Caption: would not surprise you that if you try

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:50.160
Caption: to navigate on grand.net with a screen

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:52.440
Caption: reader you&#39;re going to have a great deal

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.300
Caption: of difficulty doing it because that

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.279
Caption: structure that&#39;s replicated that

00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:58.138
Caption: structure that we see here visually is

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:59.759
Caption: replicated in the lack of structure that

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:02.039
Caption: you get when trying to navigate it with

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:04.319
Caption: a screen reader there&#39;s a hell of a lot

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:06.679
Caption: of red and green here and that&#39;s really

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:08.759
Caption: difficult for colorblind people

00:08:06.679 --> 00:08:11.098
Caption: unsurprisingly many of the images here

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:13.619
Caption: don&#39;t actually have alt text and it&#39;s

00:08:11.098 --> 00:08:15.179
Caption: also not clear which images are tied to

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:17.098
Caption: which links because of the lack of

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:19.739
Caption: structure

00:08:17.098 --> 00:08:21.779
Caption: and then there&#39;s distinctive Design This

00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:24.479
Caption: is Ling&#39;s cars and you may or may not

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:26.279
Caption: believe this but this is actually one of

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:28.619
Caption: the most successful Car leasing

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:30.959
Caption: businesses in the United Kingdom

00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:34.080
Caption: and it is built around the brand of Ling

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:38.039
Caption: Valentine the owner and the brand is

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.778
Caption: obvious Ling&#39;s face is animated the uh

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.880
Caption: tongue with the British flag on it is

00:08:39.778 --> 00:08:43.679
Caption: animated the traffic lights are animated

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.539
Caption: and my favorite bit which I couldn&#39;t get

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:48.359
Caption: into this screenshot from when I

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:50.820
Caption: originally took it was the GIF of Boris

00:08:48.359 --> 00:08:54.239
Caption: Johnson shrugging used to illustrate the

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.640
Caption: Boris brexit guarantee that if the UK

00:08:54.239 --> 00:08:58.739
Caption: left the EU the cost of leasing your car

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.838
Caption: would not go up

00:08:58.739 --> 00:09:02.820
Caption: but if you want to build a distinctive

00:09:00.838 --> 00:09:05.640
Caption: website like this there are a lot of

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.919
Caption: considerations that go into it you have

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.920
Caption: to think about things like that text

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:12.898
Caption: across the top that&#39;s not text that&#39;s

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:14.458
Caption: actually clip art so it&#39;s not

00:09:12.898 --> 00:09:16.320
Caption: necessarily going to be immediately

00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:19.018
Caption: apparent that that&#39;s the launching point

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.600
Caption: of your page and you also need to then

00:09:19.018 --> 00:09:23.458
Caption: add alt text to it you can have issues

00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:25.440
Caption: with backgrounds making it difficult for

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:27.958
Caption: people to navigate things

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.700
Caption: you know there is a lot of alt text that

00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.260
Caption: has gone into this website but when I

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.518
Caption: originally looked at it there wasn&#39;t a

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.140
Caption: lot of it there there were a lot of

00:09:32.518 --> 00:09:36.539
Caption: scenarios where pictures were used to

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.278
Caption: illustrate things without something that

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:40.380
Caption: would be backed up by a screen reader

00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:42.479
Caption: and if you have photosensitivity

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:45.359
Caption: problems you are not going to have fun

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:47.099
Caption: trying to navigate this site

00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:49.079
Caption: then there&#39;s an example of good design

00:09:47.099 --> 00:09:52.018
Caption: and this is one that probably a lot of

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:54.720
Caption: us use every day and that is GitHub

00:09:52.018 --> 00:09:57.239
Caption: GitHub does a few things really well

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:59.099
Caption: that are not necessarily intuitive to

00:09:57.239 --> 00:10:01.140
Caption: start with if you look at that top bar

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:03.599
Caption: over there you can see that you&#39;ve got

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.700
Caption: the GitHub logo the search bar but then

00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:08.458
Caption: next to it you&#39;ve actually got pull

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.919
Caption: request issues Marketplace explore and

00:10:08.458 --> 00:10:13.739
Caption: those are easy anchors for screen reader

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:16.260
Caption: users to be able to get to the areas of

00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:19.080
Caption: GitHub that they might frequently use

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:21.479
Caption: GitHub is very very good about not just

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.980
Caption: conveying information with color the

00:10:21.479 --> 00:10:26.338
Caption: layout is quite easy to understand

00:10:22.979 --> 00:10:28.859
Caption: visually it scales very well and this is

00:10:26.338 --> 00:10:30.778
Caption: actually a screenshot of the nvda repo

00:10:28.859 --> 00:10:33.119
Caption: the free and open source screen reader

00:10:30.778 --> 00:10:36.059
Caption: for Windows and the people who developed

00:10:33.119 --> 00:10:39.239
Caption: nvda migrated it over to GitHub because

00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:41.159
Caption: they found that for their users the vast

00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:43.619
Caption: majority of rumor screen reader users

00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:46.338
Caption: GitHub was a very easy way for them to

00:10:43.619 --> 00:10:46.338
Caption: submit bugs

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.778
Caption: if you want to do this well there are a

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:53.700
Caption: bunch of resources for it the web

00:10:51.778 --> 00:10:57.000
Caption: content accessibility guides are sort of

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:59.040
Caption: the canonical resource but if you find

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.359
Caption: those too difficult or if you&#39;re doing

00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:01.739
Caption: this for the first time and you want

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:04.320
Caption: something that&#39;s a bit easier to

00:11:01.739 --> 00:11:06.479
Caption: understand the accessibility project has

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.078
Caption: produced a checklist where you can just

00:11:06.479 --> 00:11:12.359
Caption: go down the checklist and it conveys it

00:11:10.078 --> 00:11:14.039
Caption: all to you in a much simpler Manner and

00:11:12.359 --> 00:11:15.659
Caption: you can pretty much just tick boxes to

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:17.518
Caption: work out do you actually follow the

00:11:15.659 --> 00:11:19.500
Caption: guidelines

00:11:17.518 --> 00:11:21.539
Caption: one thing that I don&#39;t talk very much

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.398
Caption: about in this talk is designing for

00:11:21.539 --> 00:11:25.380
Caption: intellectual and cognitive disabilities

00:11:23.398 --> 00:11:27.000
Caption: but the main resource that you&#39;re going

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.458
Caption: to want for that is the U.S federal

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.619
Caption: plain language guidelines these are

00:11:29.458 --> 00:11:33.599
Caption: published by the US government and they

00:11:31.619 --> 00:11:36.419
Caption: provide you instructions on how to use

00:11:33.599 --> 00:11:37.979
Caption: plain clear English which is going to be

00:11:36.419 --> 00:11:41.599
Caption: easier for people with intellectual and

00:11:37.979 --> 00:11:41.599
Caption: cognitive disabilities to understand

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.219
Caption: and there&#39;s a blind lady called Christy

00:11:44.219 --> 00:11:49.319
Caption: viers who produced a video which went

00:11:47.219 --> 00:11:51.958
Caption: viral on Twitter showing how she uses

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.018
Caption: her iPhone and this I think is a really

00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:56.700
Caption: important thing for people to see not

00:11:55.018 --> 00:11:59.159
Caption: because

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.739
Caption: well because it shows you what&#39;s

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:04.078
Caption: possible when you think outside the box

00:12:01.739 --> 00:12:06.059
Caption: and when you design these things taking

00:12:04.078 --> 00:12:08.398
Caption: into account a wide variety of different

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:10.380
Caption: perspectives the iPhone has Braille

00:12:08.398 --> 00:12:12.898
Caption: keyboards it has a great number of

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:16.640
Caption: haptic touch features which deliver data

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:16.640
Caption: that you would usually only get visually

00:12:18.778 --> 00:12:23.458
Caption: in the resources for accessible design

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:25.078
Caption: there are a there&#39;s a web page which

00:12:23.458 --> 00:12:27.239
Caption: links to a whole list of different

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:29.159
Caption: resources I&#39;m going to call out a few of

00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:30.419
Caption: them here that I think are important and

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:32.759
Caption: the first one is the ax core

00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:35.639
Caption: accessibility testing Library

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.260
Caption: now this is very important for

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.820
Caption: accessibility because it is entirely

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.320
Caption: open source and it&#39;s what Google&#39;s

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.078
Caption: accessibility Checker and a lot of other

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:45.479
Caption: similar things are built on

00:12:43.078 --> 00:12:47.338
Caption: the color Oracle desktop filter is a

00:12:45.479 --> 00:12:49.199
Caption: very important one for color blindness

00:12:47.338 --> 00:12:51.359
Caption: and the reason why I&#39;m calling this tool

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.579
Caption: out specifically is there are a bunch of

00:12:51.359 --> 00:12:55.739
Caption: browser extensions that you can get but

00:12:53.578 --> 00:12:59.159
Caption: the color Oracle desktop filter is the

00:12:55.739 --> 00:13:01.979
Caption: only one that will allow you to plug it

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:03.599
Caption: into desktop applications as well so if

00:13:01.979 --> 00:13:06.000
Caption: you&#39;re developing a desktop application

00:13:03.599 --> 00:13:07.919
Caption: rather than a web application that&#39;s a

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.479
Caption: very useful tool

00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:11.219
Caption: if you want to test what you&#39;re doing

00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:12.479
Caption: with a screen reader the patch yellow

00:13:11.219 --> 00:13:14.939
Caption: group one of the very early

00:13:12.479 --> 00:13:16.679
Caption: accessibility consultancies produced a

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.000
Caption: list of basic screen reader commands for

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:20.039
Caption: pretty much all of the common screen

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.099
Caption: readers and you can just get those up on

00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:25.799
Caption: a computer and try them out yourself

00:13:23.099 --> 00:13:27.419
Caption: Additionally the researchers at the

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:30.059
Caption: University of Maryland produce the

00:13:27.419 --> 00:13:32.219
Caption: photosensitive epilepsy analysis tool a

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:33.719
Caption: few years ago and that one is really

00:13:32.219 --> 00:13:36.179
Caption: important because photosensitive

00:13:33.719 --> 00:13:39.179
Caption: epilepsy is a disability that we can&#39;t

00:13:36.179 --> 00:13:40.739
Caption: ask people to test for if you&#39;re asking

00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:42.599
Caption: people to test for that and they have a

00:13:40.739 --> 00:13:44.398
Caption: seizure that&#39;s potentially going to be

00:13:42.599 --> 00:13:46.500
Caption: threatening to their health or in the

00:13:44.398 --> 00:13:48.000
Caption: worst case threatening to their life so

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.219
Caption: the researchers at the University of

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.539
Caption: Maryland produce this tool which

00:13:50.219 --> 00:13:53.699
Caption: basically allows you to check the

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:55.559
Caption: contrast and animations on your website

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.179
Caption: to ensure that they&#39;re not going to be a

00:13:55.559 --> 00:13:59.778
Caption: problem for people with photosensitive

00:13:57.179 --> 00:13:59.778
Caption: epilepsy

00:14:00.059 --> 00:14:05.338
Caption: now guidelines are great guidelines are

00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:08.458
Caption: a really good starting point but

00:14:05.338 --> 00:14:12.119
Caption: guidelines do not tell the whole story

00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:15.000
Caption: this really comes down to that often

00:14:12.119 --> 00:14:16.799
Caption: misused adage of the 80 20 principle and

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.719
Caption: I&#39;ll sum it up like this

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:20.940
Caption: the vast majority of accessibility

00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:22.919
Caption: issues that you might run into can be

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.720
Caption: very easily solved by looking at and

00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:26.820
Caption: understanding the guidelines

00:14:24.719 --> 00:14:28.739
Caption: but there are some accessibility issues

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.940
Caption: that the guidelines don&#39;t cover and

00:14:28.739 --> 00:14:31.799
Caption: there are situations where the

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.919
Caption: guidelines are misleading

00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:37.018
Caption: in those sorts of scenarios what you

00:14:34.919 --> 00:14:39.239
Caption: want to do is make sure that you have a

00:14:37.018 --> 00:14:41.539
Caption: clear and understandable path for people

00:14:39.239 --> 00:14:43.559
Caption: who have those issues to come to you

00:14:41.539 --> 00:14:45.778
Caption: report them

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:49.278
Caption: and get them to the right people so that

00:14:45.778 --> 00:14:49.278
Caption: they are going to be actioned

00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:54.778
Caption: and with most accessibility talks this

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:56.819
Caption: is the point at which the person giving

00:14:54.778 --> 00:14:59.099
Caption: the talk would explain to you how to

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.898
Caption: solve one particular problem in one

00:14:59.099 --> 00:15:02.698
Caption: particular language for one particular

00:15:00.898 --> 00:15:05.219
Caption: scenario

00:15:02.698 --> 00:15:06.958
Caption: this is not one of that talks and the

00:15:05.219 --> 00:15:08.819
Caption: reason for that is because I think it&#39;s

00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:11.398
Caption: often very instructive to look at the

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.018
Caption: ways that people do this wrong

00:15:11.398 --> 00:15:15.659
Caption: so that we can learn from them and

00:15:13.018 --> 00:15:18.778
Caption: hopefully not repeat the mistakes

00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:20.638
Caption: this is atlassian Confluence and my

00:15:18.778 --> 00:15:22.500
Caption: assumption is that the vast majority of

00:15:20.638 --> 00:15:24.898
Caption: the people in the audience here have

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.518
Caption: used atlassian Confluence before for

00:15:24.898 --> 00:15:29.099
Caption: those of you who haven&#39;t it&#39;s basically

00:15:26.518 --> 00:15:31.198
Caption: a shared documentation Wiki so you&#39;ve

00:15:29.099 --> 00:15:34.018
Caption: got a test space here you&#39;ve got a bunch

00:15:31.198 --> 00:15:36.778
Caption: of data you can click around it you can

00:15:34.018 --> 00:15:39.059
Caption: go in and create pages and when you

00:15:36.778 --> 00:15:40.799
Caption: click the button to create a page you

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:42.539
Caption: get something back that looks a bit like

00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:48.479
Caption: this

00:15:42.539 --> 00:15:48.479
Caption: and that looks fine right

00:15:48.719 --> 00:15:53.278
Caption: but we&#39;re gonna go back and look at that

00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:55.559
Caption: again because despite the fact that this

00:15:53.278 --> 00:15:57.719
Caption: page was created in my test space which

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:59.940
Caption: you can see because my name is up there

00:15:57.719 --> 00:16:01.679
Caption: I actually wasn&#39;t the person who created

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.018
Caption: it it was created by someone called

00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:07.018
Caption: Matthew Gregory and at the time that I

00:16:04.018 --> 00:16:09.179
Caption: first gave this talk Matt was my manager

00:16:07.018 --> 00:16:11.099
Caption: so why was it that Matt was the person

00:16:09.179 --> 00:16:13.380
Caption: who was creating this page and not me

00:16:11.099 --> 00:16:17.099
Caption: well

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:18.898
Caption: that would be your answer because when I

00:16:17.099 --> 00:16:21.119
Caption: went into Confluence back in the day and

00:16:18.898 --> 00:16:23.219
Caption: I tried to create Pages what I would get

00:16:21.119 --> 00:16:25.679
Caption: is that the button there would be cut

00:16:23.219 --> 00:16:27.299
Caption: off the bottom of the screen which meant

00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:31.018
Caption: that I could not navigate to it which

00:16:27.299 --> 00:16:32.880
Caption: meant that I could not create pages

00:16:31.018 --> 00:16:35.398
Caption: oops

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.958
Caption: so you can actually scroll the options

00:16:35.398 --> 00:16:38.578
Caption: within the Confluence pop-up and

00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:40.859
Caption: atlassian have done a bit of work in

00:16:38.578 --> 00:16:43.018
Caption: fixing this since but

00:16:40.859 --> 00:16:45.119
Caption: what this essentially meant at the time

00:16:43.018 --> 00:16:46.679
Caption: was that if you were using a magnified

00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:48.659
Caption: screen for particular configurations

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:50.880
Caption: because you couldn&#39;t scroll the whole

00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:52.799
Caption: screen to see the whole pop-up you just

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.419
Caption: wouldn&#39;t be able to create Pages at all

00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:57.179
Caption: or you would have to learn how to tab

00:16:54.419 --> 00:16:59.099
Caption: navigate your way around blind without

00:16:57.179 --> 00:17:00.838
Caption: screen reader cues to be able to do it

00:16:59.099 --> 00:17:02.698
Caption: and that pretty much meant that that was

00:17:00.838 --> 00:17:04.260
Caption: a piece of work that I just offloaded

00:17:02.698 --> 00:17:06.119
Caption: onto my colleagues every time I needed

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.919
Caption: to create a page I called someone over

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:09.958
Caption: and I went hey can you come do this for

00:17:07.918 --> 00:17:12.000
Caption: me please

00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:14.938
Caption: so how do we improve it

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.918
Caption: well you want to make sure that your UI

00:17:14.938 --> 00:17:18.599
Caption: elements are all scrollable and that

00:17:16.918 --> 00:17:21.178
Caption: nothing is cut off by the bottom of the

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:23.760
Caption: screen so you want to set it up so that

00:17:21.178 --> 00:17:25.558
Caption: it&#39;s not just you know scrolling the

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.318
Caption: options within the pop-up that the whole

00:17:25.558 --> 00:17:30.178
Caption: page there is scrollable

00:17:28.318 --> 00:17:32.280
Caption: you want to make sure that you test your

00:17:30.178 --> 00:17:34.319
Caption: pop-up windows for accessibility so

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:37.020
Caption: looking at things like do they block out

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:39.000
Caption: other elements of the user interface if

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.099
Caption: someone is using a zoomed in screen or a

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.780
Caption: screen reader can they actually navigate

00:17:41.099 --> 00:17:44.939
Caption: their way around this pop-up window

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:47.099
Caption: without losing focus without things

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:48.959
Caption: being cut off the bottom of the screen

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:51.660
Caption: and the best way to deal with it is you

00:17:48.959 --> 00:17:53.520
Caption: zooming up yourself or you find a

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.619
Caption: visually impaired person you get them to

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.780
Caption: test it for you and that will very

00:17:55.619 --> 00:18:00.859
Caption: quickly show you where a lot of those

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.859
Caption: issues are going to be

00:18:01.439 --> 00:18:06.058
Caption: I need a human screen reader now I was

00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:08.038
Caption: not the person who said this the person

00:18:06.058 --> 00:18:10.739
Caption: who said I need a human screen reader

00:18:08.038 --> 00:18:12.779
Caption: was my friend&#39;s grandmother she is

00:18:10.739 --> 00:18:15.959
Caption: unfortunately now deceased she was a

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:18.059
Caption: lovely person and later on in life due

00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:21.719
Caption: to a degenerative disease she became

00:18:18.058 --> 00:18:24.359
Caption: blind now she was quite religious and

00:18:21.719 --> 00:18:26.159
Caption: she used the pathos website which built

00:18:24.359 --> 00:18:27.839
Caption: itself as hosting the conversation on

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.700
Caption: faith to keep in touch with her

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:32.819
Caption: religious community when she was no

00:18:29.699 --> 00:18:35.639
Caption: longer able to easily go to church

00:18:32.819 --> 00:18:38.519
Caption: and when she started using papayos many

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:41.579
Caption: many years ago it looked like this

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.799
Caption: and Visually that site is not too bad it

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:46.439
Caption: was also not all that bad to navigate

00:18:43.798 --> 00:18:49.439
Caption: with a screen reader it wasn&#39;t perfect

00:18:46.439 --> 00:18:51.418
Caption: but you could see where things were you

00:18:49.439 --> 00:18:54.298
Caption: could relatively easily navigate your

00:18:51.418 --> 00:18:56.579
Caption: way around most of it and it was fairly

00:18:54.298 --> 00:18:58.260
Caption: apparent what was going on where they

00:18:56.579 --> 00:19:01.260
Caption: also designed it in such a way that you

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.940
Caption: didn&#39;t have Auto playing videos and

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.339
Caption: cluttered pop-ups which would come up

00:19:02.939 --> 00:19:09.599
Caption: and block your view of part of the page

00:19:05.339 --> 00:19:11.400
Caption: until in late 2017 early 2018 pathos

00:19:09.599 --> 00:19:13.140
Caption: went through a redesign and at the end

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.119
Caption: of the redesign their website looked

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:18.299
Caption: like this

00:19:15.119 --> 00:19:20.459
Caption: and I can&#39;t show you the accessibility

00:19:18.298 --> 00:19:22.199
Caption: issues with their website

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:24.599
Caption: because some of the problems that they

00:19:22.199 --> 00:19:26.339
Caption: had were so bad that at the time I was

00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:27.900
Caption: originally putting this talk together a

00:19:26.339 --> 00:19:29.880
Caption: lot of the major browsers released a

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.219
Caption: feature that blocked a lot of these

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.298
Caption: obnoxious pop-ups on site that the

00:19:32.219 --> 00:19:34.798
Caption: beginning of that text there

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:36.599
Caption: advertisement

00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:38.699
Caption: I wasn&#39;t using an ad blocker when I did

00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:40.380
Caption: this that was just blocked but back in

00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:42.599
Caption: the day when my friend&#39;s grandmother was

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.298
Caption: trying to use this website what would

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:47.160
Caption: happen was she would tab around and

00:19:45.298 --> 00:19:49.199
Caption: suddenly she would find herself in an ad

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.059
Caption: pop-up or there would be Auto playing

00:19:49.199 --> 00:19:52.739
Caption: videos that were talking over her screen

00:19:51.058 --> 00:19:54.359
Caption: reader which meant that she couldn&#39;t

00:19:52.739 --> 00:19:56.459
Caption: hear the cues that she needed to

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:58.500
Caption: navigate around the website and that

00:19:56.459 --> 00:20:00.418
Caption: made her feel something like this

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.219
Caption: she was not happy she was not very

00:20:00.418 --> 00:20:03.839
Caption: pleased and she no longer used the

00:20:02.219 --> 00:20:05.819
Caption: pathos website

00:20:03.839 --> 00:20:10.439
Caption: if you want an example of this closer to

00:20:05.819 --> 00:20:13.079
Caption: home Coles the big supermarket chain got

00:20:10.439 --> 00:20:15.839
Caption: sued by a screen reader user because of

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:18.119
Caption: their website for online ordering was

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:21.058
Caption: not accessible with a screen reader

00:20:18.119 --> 00:20:22.859
Caption: and Coles ended up settling that lawsuit

00:20:21.058 --> 00:20:24.418
Caption: and one of the stipulations of the

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:26.339
Caption: settlement was that Coles actually had

00:20:24.418 --> 00:20:29.399
Caption: to make sure that their online website

00:20:26.339 --> 00:20:30.839
Caption: was accessible to screen reader users so

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.820
Caption: if you want to have a look at someone

00:20:30.839 --> 00:20:34.319
Caption: who does this really well causes it and

00:20:32.819 --> 00:20:36.178
Caption: that&#39;s because now they know they have

00:20:34.319 --> 00:20:38.219
Caption: to do it

00:20:36.178 --> 00:20:40.739
Caption: oops

00:20:38.219 --> 00:20:42.780
Caption: so the sound on auto playing videos

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:44.459
Caption: talks over screen readers and when you

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.400
Caption: think about the fact that screen readers

00:20:44.459 --> 00:20:49.199
Caption: are providing auditor cues to help you

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.719
Caption: with the visual cues that you miss if

00:20:49.199 --> 00:20:54.119
Caption: your vision impaired that can be quite a

00:20:51.719 --> 00:20:56.699
Caption: big problem but the bigger problem is

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:59.880
Caption: that if you can&#39;t see the video on the

00:20:56.699 --> 00:21:01.439
Caption: page you&#39;re relying on being able to

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.539
Caption: hear the screen readers triggers that

00:21:01.439 --> 00:21:05.399
Caption: will tell you how to close it if the

00:21:03.538 --> 00:21:06.959
Caption: video is talking over the screen reader

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.820
Caption: that&#39;s not something that you&#39;re going

00:21:06.959 --> 00:21:10.678
Caption: to be able to do

00:21:08.819 --> 00:21:12.178
Caption: and what&#39;s even worse is that some of

00:21:10.678 --> 00:21:13.979
Caption: these pop-up advertisements and auto

00:21:12.178 --> 00:21:16.140
Caption: playing videos will actually take screen

00:21:13.979 --> 00:21:18.418
Caption: readers into an entirely new container

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:20.579
Caption: which acts as a new page and then you

00:21:18.418 --> 00:21:24.000
Caption: just get a bunch of triggers that go

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:26.640
Caption: image image image item text and so on

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.739
Caption: and so forth looping around

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.419
Caption: and if you are a screen reader user

00:21:28.739 --> 00:21:32.219
Caption: expecting to see a whole page and you

00:21:30.418 --> 00:21:34.939
Caption: don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened that can be

00:21:32.219 --> 00:21:34.939
Caption: really confusing

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.419
Caption: to make matters worse not all pop-ups

00:21:37.678 --> 00:21:41.219
Caption: and auto playing videos have a dismiss

00:21:39.418 --> 00:21:43.918
Caption: button that won&#39;t even work if you don&#39;t

00:21:41.219 --> 00:21:45.959
Caption: have a mouse there are some scenarios in

00:21:43.918 --> 00:21:47.880
Caption: which you set up your whole page and you

00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:49.558
Caption: go through and you try and make sure

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.058
Caption: that you can actually close things and

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:52.859
Caption: you find that that close Trigger or that

00:21:51.058 --> 00:21:55.199
Caption: dismiss trigger just isn&#39;t visible if

00:21:52.859 --> 00:21:57.058
Caption: you&#39;re navigating via keyboard it&#39;s not

00:21:55.199 --> 00:21:59.038
Caption: correctly placed and that can be a

00:21:57.058 --> 00:22:01.918
Caption: really big problem

00:21:59.038 --> 00:22:03.719
Caption: so how do we improve it well it&#39;s pretty

00:22:01.918 --> 00:22:05.579
Caption: good design just let people decide

00:22:03.719 --> 00:22:08.400
Caption: whether they want to play videos Auto

00:22:05.579 --> 00:22:11.038
Caption: playing videos are really annoying and

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.539
Caption: it is even more important to let users

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:14.819
Caption: decide because of the accessibility

00:22:12.538 --> 00:22:16.798
Caption: implications of this

00:22:14.819 --> 00:22:18.599
Caption: you also want to make it easy for

00:22:16.798 --> 00:22:20.819
Caption: keyboard Navigators and screen reader

00:22:18.599 --> 00:22:22.798
Caption: users to ignore or close those pop-up

00:22:20.819 --> 00:22:25.619
Caption: elements so make sure that the dismiss

00:22:22.798 --> 00:22:27.779
Caption: trigger is easily visible to a screen

00:22:25.619 --> 00:22:29.819
Caption: reader make sure that it&#39;s very early on

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.320
Caption: make sure that it&#39;s placed in the sort

00:22:29.819 --> 00:22:32.939
Caption: of location that they would think it

00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:35.939
Caption: would be

00:22:32.939 --> 00:22:37.199
Caption: now Safari has a reader mode a lot of

00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:38.699
Caption: other browsers have reader mode

00:22:37.199 --> 00:22:40.859
Caption: extensions there&#39;s even one you can get

00:22:38.699 --> 00:22:42.418
Caption: for the CLI which I probably need to go

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:43.140
Caption: back and add to the sources at some

00:22:42.418 --> 00:22:45.418
Caption: point

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.700
Caption: but what reader mode essentially does is

00:22:45.418 --> 00:22:50.639
Caption: it strips out everything on the website

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:52.619
Caption: except for the text and the images and

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.940
Caption: that can be a really useful fullback for

00:22:52.619 --> 00:22:55.558
Caption: blind or visually impaired people

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:57.599
Caption: because the screen reader is then going

00:22:55.558 --> 00:23:00.479
Caption: to be able to readily navigate around it

00:22:57.599 --> 00:23:02.400
Caption: so do check to make sure that your HTML

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:03.959
Caption: is properly formatted check to make sure

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.339
Caption: that reader mode works the way that you

00:23:03.959 --> 00:23:07.558
Caption: would expect it to

00:23:05.339 --> 00:23:09.599
Caption: and then put on a blindfold cover your

00:23:07.558 --> 00:23:10.739
Caption: screen use a screen reader yourself it&#39;s

00:23:09.599 --> 00:23:12.719
Caption: not going to be as good as getting

00:23:10.739 --> 00:23:14.520
Caption: people who use it day to day but you

00:23:12.719 --> 00:23:16.380
Caption: will very quickly pick up on what the

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.179
Caption: issues might be when you do a direct

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:21.479
Caption: comparison of what the screen reader

00:23:18.178 --> 00:23:24.380
Caption: gives you to what you actually get when

00:23:21.479 --> 00:23:24.380
Caption: you look at it visually

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:30.599
Caption: does anyone here remember geocities

00:23:28.439 --> 00:23:33.000
Caption: cool yup we have an audience of people

00:23:30.599 --> 00:23:34.979
Caption: that remember geocities

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.199
Caption: those of you who don&#39;t geoseties

00:23:34.979 --> 00:23:39.780
Caption: websites tended to look something like

00:23:37.199 --> 00:23:41.339
Caption: this this is admittedly one of the less

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:43.500
Caption: obnoxious options that I could have

00:23:41.339 --> 00:23:45.359
Caption: picked but it&#39;s still very emblematic of

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.219
Caption: what web design in that sort of era was

00:23:45.359 --> 00:23:48.839
Caption: like we&#39;ve got the word up we&#39;ve got the

00:23:47.219 --> 00:23:51.298
Caption: dancing penguin we&#39;ve got a bunch of

00:23:48.839 --> 00:23:53.400
Caption: clashing colors we&#39;ve got broken links

00:23:51.298 --> 00:23:55.558
Caption: we&#39;ve got a whole lot of text in

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.820
Caption: different colors in Thai

00:23:55.558 --> 00:23:58.678
Caption: um all that we&#39;re really missing is you

00:23:56.819 --> 00:24:00.000
Caption: know the line of rainbow Kirby&#39;s jumping

00:23:58.678 --> 00:24:03.058
Caption: across the top and then it would be very

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.418
Caption: much a geocities website

00:24:03.058 --> 00:24:10.500
Caption: geocities is dead Yahoo bought it and

00:24:06.418 --> 00:24:12.538
Caption: they killed it off in March of 2019.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.159
Caption: fortunately or unfortunately depending

00:24:12.538 --> 00:24:17.519
Caption: on how you look at it a lot of the

00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:19.380
Caption: people who came into web design in the

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.219
Caption: era where geocities were state of the

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.199
Caption: art

00:24:20.219 --> 00:24:24.418
Caption: now actually have quite a lot of

00:24:22.199 --> 00:24:26.880
Caption: creative control over their own websites

00:24:24.418 --> 00:24:29.339
Caption: and many of them have Incorporated some

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.500
Caption: of these elements of the geocities era

00:24:29.339 --> 00:24:33.359
Caption: into their corporate websites which is

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.339
Caption: essentially the equivalent of taking

00:24:33.359 --> 00:24:37.260
Caption: your very productive businesses fancy

00:24:35.339 --> 00:24:39.418
Caption: corporate website we are very amazing

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.880
Caption: and we will show you why

00:24:39.418 --> 00:24:43.859
Caption: and putting a Nyan cat across the top of

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.659
Caption: it which is not something I&#39;m going to

00:24:43.859 --> 00:24:49.439
Caption: recommend unless whatever your business

00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:51.600
Caption: is is very very niche

00:24:49.439 --> 00:24:53.519
Caption: I have a friend who has photosensitive

00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:56.099
Caption: epilepsy and she works in the IT

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.900
Caption: industry several years ago she had an

00:24:56.099 --> 00:25:00.359
Caption: encounter with one of these enterprising

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.979
Caption: designers from the geocities era

00:25:00.359 --> 00:25:04.619
Caption: she heard about this particular tech

00:25:01.979 --> 00:25:06.479
Caption: company and she wanted to see what they

00:25:04.619 --> 00:25:07.558
Caption: were all about and so she went to their

00:25:06.479 --> 00:25:09.599
Caption: website

00:25:07.558 --> 00:25:11.819
Caption: and what she encountered there was a

00:25:09.599 --> 00:25:14.280
Caption: giant strobing Pink element that took up

00:25:11.819 --> 00:25:16.380
Caption: the top two-thirds of her screen

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.780
Caption: which pretty much immediately caused her

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.760
Caption: to have a seizure and the end result of

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:23.520
Caption: that was that the enterprising designer

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.260
Caption: had a phone call which I really

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.900
Caption: suspected he probably didn&#39;t want to be

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.159
Caption: on the other end of

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.099
Caption: oops

00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:34.740
Caption: so flashing flickering and strobing

00:25:32.099 --> 00:25:36.298
Caption: effects are one of the major causes of

00:25:34.739 --> 00:25:38.459
Caption: seizures and if you&#39;re a video game

00:25:36.298 --> 00:25:41.399
Caption: player and you get games in physical

00:25:38.459 --> 00:25:43.380
Caption: boxes if you flip over to the back of

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:46.140
Caption: the game quite often they have that

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:48.000
Caption: little bit of text there that says hey

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.320
Caption: there&#39;s a flashing flickering and

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.178
Caption: strobing warning here if you&#39;re

00:25:49.319 --> 00:25:52.859
Caption: photosensitive you want to be careful

00:25:51.178 --> 00:25:53.819
Caption: about playing this that&#39;s what that is

00:25:52.859 --> 00:25:56.278
Caption: for

00:25:53.819 --> 00:25:58.918
Caption: and it&#39;s much more severe generally if

00:25:56.279 --> 00:26:01.200
Caption: you&#39;re looking at saturated Reds pinks

00:25:58.918 --> 00:26:02.939
Caption: oranges and really high contrast effect

00:26:01.199 --> 00:26:05.099
Caption: so if you&#39;re strobing something from

00:26:02.939 --> 00:26:06.538
Caption: pink to white or red to White that&#39;s

00:26:05.099 --> 00:26:08.219
Caption: going to be much more of a problem than

00:26:06.538 --> 00:26:10.558
Caption: a tiny little animation in the corner

00:26:08.219 --> 00:26:12.239
Caption: that&#39;s going dark blue to dark green

00:26:10.558 --> 00:26:14.278
Caption: particularly because photosensitive

00:26:12.239 --> 00:26:15.778
Caption: epilepsy is a spectrum from mild to

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:17.640
Caption: severe

00:26:15.779 --> 00:26:19.740
Caption: at the milder end it&#39;s quite easy to

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.200
Caption: work out but my friend being one of the

00:26:19.739 --> 00:26:24.000
Caption: more severe cases runs into this more

00:26:22.199 --> 00:26:25.678
Caption: often than she should and so you&#39;ve got

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.199
Caption: to be aware then of what the parameters

00:26:25.678 --> 00:26:31.319
Caption: are that you&#39;re dealing with

00:26:28.199 --> 00:26:33.959
Caption: so how do we improve it well to begin

00:26:31.319 --> 00:26:35.699
Caption: with if you can you want to avoid using

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:36.899
Caption: those flashing flickering and strobing

00:26:35.699 --> 00:26:39.418
Caption: effects

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.979
Caption: if you do need to use them the two

00:26:39.418 --> 00:26:42.178
Caption: changes that you want to make are you

00:26:40.979 --> 00:26:43.979
Caption: want to make sure that they are low

00:26:42.178 --> 00:26:45.778
Caption: contrast and you want to make sure that

00:26:43.979 --> 00:26:47.640
Caption: they&#39;re as small as possible that

00:26:45.779 --> 00:26:49.500
Caption: flashing from dark blue to dark green in

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.359
Caption: the corner is not going to be nearly as

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.918
Caption: much of a problem as the giant strobing

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:54.418
Caption: Pink element that takes up the top two

00:26:52.918 --> 00:26:56.699
Caption: thirds of your page

00:26:54.418 --> 00:26:58.859
Caption: and if you can avoid it don&#39;t use

00:26:56.699 --> 00:27:01.139
Caption: particularly saturated Reds and pinks

00:26:58.859 --> 00:27:03.658
Caption: and also sometimes oranges for those

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.760
Caption: sorts of flashing effects

00:27:03.659 --> 00:27:07.620
Caption: if you really want to do this well and

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.260
Caption: you have a website where you absolutely

00:27:07.619 --> 00:27:12.298
Caption: have to have animation on it give users

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.678
Caption: the option to disable and enable it at

00:27:12.298 --> 00:27:15.839
Caption: will that&#39;s the sort of thing that&#39;s

00:27:13.678 --> 00:27:17.760
Caption: really useful for scenarios like Ling&#39;s

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:19.020
Caption: cars because it means that if you have

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.539
Caption: people who have those sorts of

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:23.880
Caption: photosensitivity issues they can still

00:27:21.538 --> 00:27:25.139
Caption: actually access your website even if

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.739
Caption: it&#39;s not quite in the way that you might

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.739
Caption: have intended

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:33.359
Caption: now there is actually a certain amount

00:27:31.199 --> 00:27:35.880
Caption: of precedent for disabled people being

00:27:33.359 --> 00:27:37.558
Caption: involved in integrated Sports and that

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.418
Caption: can be everything from kids playing in

00:27:37.558 --> 00:27:42.178
Caption: the schoolyard to Olympic Champions like

00:27:39.418 --> 00:27:45.239
Caption: rato ildico the Hungarian fencer and

00:27:42.178 --> 00:27:47.579
Caption: imdong Hyun the Korean Archer

00:27:45.239 --> 00:27:49.439
Caption: but for this specific case study I want

00:27:47.579 --> 00:27:51.859
Caption: to look at a more modern version of

00:27:49.439 --> 00:27:54.839
Caption: sports we&#39;re going to look at Esports

00:27:51.859 --> 00:27:57.418
Caption: specifically League of Legends

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:59.579
Caption: this is for those of you who are not

00:27:57.418 --> 00:28:01.319
Caption: into video games pretty much a

00:27:59.579 --> 00:28:03.899
Caption: computerized Tower Defense you have

00:28:01.319 --> 00:28:05.880
Caption: teams of five people and they&#39;re trying

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.099
Caption: to defend a tower

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.140
Caption: each of the people on those five teams

00:28:08.099 --> 00:28:12.538
Caption: can pick characters or Champions that

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:14.640
Caption: have different abilities and League of

00:28:12.538 --> 00:28:17.219
Caption: Legends has a really thriving

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.558
Caption: professional scene you can actually make

00:28:17.219 --> 00:28:21.178
Caption: a decent living playing League of

00:28:19.558 --> 00:28:23.158
Caption: Legends professionally if you&#39;re very

00:28:21.178 --> 00:28:25.380
Caption: good at it

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:27.120
Caption: several years ago the creators of League

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:29.699
Caption: of Legends introduced a new Champion

00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:33.000
Caption: called Tom kench and this is the titular

00:28:29.699 --> 00:28:36.599
Caption: catfish you can see there redfish on the

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.640
Caption: left and green fish on the right

00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:40.739
Caption: time can turn a mechanic that no other

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.320
Caption: character in the game had had before and

00:28:40.739 --> 00:28:45.119
Caption: that mechanic is called gray health and

00:28:43.319 --> 00:28:46.678
Caption: this is where we find out how many

00:28:45.119 --> 00:28:48.719
Caption: colorblind people are in the audience

00:28:46.678 --> 00:28:50.459
Caption: today because for those of you who are

00:28:48.719 --> 00:28:52.619
Caption: not colorblind if you have a look at

00:28:50.459 --> 00:28:53.880
Caption: that on the red side you can see that

00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:55.678
Caption: there&#39;s a chunk of the health bar that&#39;s

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.599
Caption: red then there&#39;s a big chunk of the

00:28:55.678 --> 00:28:59.158
Caption: health bar that&#39;s great and that&#39;s

00:28:57.599 --> 00:29:00.719
Caption: essentially acting as a shield which

00:28:59.159 --> 00:29:02.880
Caption: means that at this point Tom kench is

00:29:00.719 --> 00:29:04.678
Caption: unkillable and then on the right hand

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.719
Caption: side you&#39;ve got that little bit which is

00:29:04.678 --> 00:29:08.760
Caption: kind of shaded out red and that&#39;s the

00:29:06.719 --> 00:29:10.859
Caption: health that he&#39;s lost

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.839
Caption: but if I put a color blindness filter

00:29:10.859 --> 00:29:16.260
Caption: over that particularly on the left side

00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:18.719
Caption: the red side which is the enemy side

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:20.760
Caption: that&#39;s suddenly not so clear

00:29:18.719 --> 00:29:22.678
Caption: and given that somewhere between eight

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.260
Caption: and ten percent of the population mostly

00:29:22.678 --> 00:29:27.479
Caption: men are colorblind it was inevitable

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.859
Caption: that when with teams of five you are

00:29:27.479 --> 00:29:31.260
Caption: eventually going to have a tweet like

00:29:28.859 --> 00:29:33.178
Caption: this from a professional player if you

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:35.219
Caption: didn&#39;t know I&#39;m colorblind along with

00:29:33.178 --> 00:29:36.898
Caption: two other members of my team all three

00:29:35.219 --> 00:29:40.380
Caption: of us can&#39;t see what health he&#39;s at in

00:29:36.899 --> 00:29:42.299
Caption: colorblind mode he being Tom kenchier

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.918
Caption: again these are professional players

00:29:42.298 --> 00:29:47.298
Caption: this is something that they need to be

00:29:43.918 --> 00:29:47.298
Caption: able to do to do their job

00:29:48.659 --> 00:29:53.159
Caption: so most colorblind people can&#39;t tell the

00:29:51.119 --> 00:29:54.899
Caption: difference between red and green but as

00:29:53.159 --> 00:29:56.640
Caption: you can see there from the colorblind

00:29:54.899 --> 00:29:58.799
Caption: filter the other crucial bit of

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.260
Caption: information here is the contrast between

00:29:58.798 --> 00:30:03.359
Caption: colors if you can&#39;t distinguish the

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:06.419
Caption: difference between particular colors

00:30:03.359 --> 00:30:09.599
Caption: you&#39;re going to use that contrast to see

00:30:06.418 --> 00:30:11.459
Caption: is this what I think it is or is it not

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:13.020
Caption: because what you basically get with

00:30:11.459 --> 00:30:14.699
Caption: colors that colorblind people can&#39;t see

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:17.039
Caption: is they&#39;ll generally look some variation

00:30:14.699 --> 00:30:19.199
Caption: of gray black brown or black or they&#39;ll

00:30:17.038 --> 00:30:21.599
Caption: be ambiguous

00:30:19.199 --> 00:30:24.239
Caption: and the way that we improve this to

00:30:21.599 --> 00:30:25.918
Caption: start with is by using a contrast

00:30:24.239 --> 00:30:27.658
Caption: Checker to make sure that elements are

00:30:25.918 --> 00:30:29.398
Caption: going to be viewable

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:31.140
Caption: to people with all different types of

00:30:29.399 --> 00:30:33.059
Caption: color blindness and I&#39;m not just talking

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.579
Caption: about red and green color blindness here

00:30:33.058 --> 00:30:37.619
Caption: which are the most common types you also

00:30:35.579 --> 00:30:40.558
Caption: need to design for blue color blindness

00:30:37.619 --> 00:30:42.599
Caption: and people with no color vision at all

00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:44.699
Caption: slack does this really well slack for

00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:47.038
Caption: many years has had accessibility themes

00:30:44.699 --> 00:30:49.199
Caption: for protonopia and deuteronopia so red

00:30:47.038 --> 00:30:51.298

Caption: appeal which is blue GitHub is another

00:30:51.298 --> 00:30:54.839
Caption: one that more recently has done that

00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:56.699
Caption: very well

00:30:54.839 --> 00:30:58.199
Caption: and even if you have a colorblind mode

00:30:56.699 --> 00:31:00.359
Caption: particularly if you&#39;re just designing

00:30:58.199 --> 00:31:02.459
Caption: for red and green color blindness try

00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:03.839
Caption: putting a filter over get people to test

00:31:02.459 --> 00:31:06.119
Caption: it and make sure that it actually does

00:31:03.839 --> 00:31:08.038
Caption: what you think it would do right games

00:31:06.119 --> 00:31:09.899
Caption: the creators of League of Legends to

00:31:08.038 --> 00:31:11.879
Caption: their credit did actually fix this quite

00:31:09.899 --> 00:31:13.980
Caption: quickly when it came to their attention

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.539
Caption: but it&#39;s that sort of user acceptance

00:31:13.979 --> 00:31:18.239
Caption: testing that can often pick up those

00:31:15.538 --> 00:31:20.278
Caption: issues before they get to production

00:31:18.239 --> 00:31:22.079
Caption: and if you&#39;re building a colorblind mode

00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:24.059
Caption: for something you want to try and make

00:31:22.079 --> 00:31:26.099
Caption: sure that you&#39;re using meaningful icons

00:31:24.058 --> 00:31:28.439
Caption: or meaningful information to indicate

00:31:26.099 --> 00:31:30.298
Caption: different elements in state not just

00:31:28.439 --> 00:31:32.158
Caption: color if what you&#39;re getting is you know

00:31:30.298 --> 00:31:33.599
Caption: we&#39;re using a square a circle on a

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:35.760
Caption: rectangle to try to tell difference

00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:37.739
Caption: between these things that&#39;s not much

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.699
Caption: better whereas if you&#39;ve got a great big

00:31:37.739 --> 00:31:40.500
Caption: tick

00:31:38.699 --> 00:31:43.699

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.699
Caption: whether it&#39;s green or not

00:31:45.239 --> 00:31:50.640
Caption: it&#39;s 2020 round three and I can&#39;t

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.699
Caption: believe I&#39;m saying this but if we cast

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.659
Caption: our mind back a few years to 2020 round

00:31:53.699 --> 00:31:56.760
Caption: one

00:31:54.659 --> 00:31:59.159
Caption: before the whole covert pandemic thing

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.500
Caption: happened you might remember I certainly

00:31:59.159 --> 00:32:03.480
Caption: do in Melbourne we had pretty extensive

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.520
Caption: bushfires which blanketed quite a lot of

00:32:03.479 --> 00:32:07.260

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:10.320
Caption: bushfires and through the covid-19

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:12.178
Caption: pandemic a lot of people became aware of

00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:14.398
Caption: different aspects of accessibility that

00:32:12.178 --> 00:32:16.019
Caption: they hadn&#39;t been aware of before and one

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:18.179
Caption: of these was sign language interpreters

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:20.520
Caption: because every time we had the prime

00:32:18.178 --> 00:32:22.319
Caption: minister or a premier or a chief Health

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.899
Caption: officer or someone from the Emergency

00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:27.178
Caption: Services coming onto our televisions

00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:28.919

00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:31.079
Caption: Australian sign language interpreter

00:32:28.918 --> 00:32:32.819
Caption: next to them and that was to ensure that

00:32:31.079 --> 00:32:34.918
Caption: for people where sign language is their

00:32:32.819 --> 00:32:37.500
Caption: first language they were able to get

00:32:34.918 --> 00:32:39.599
Caption: that information conveyed to them in a

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.339
Caption: timely manner in case they needed to

00:32:39.599 --> 00:32:44.038
Caption: evacuate or to make sure that they knew

00:32:41.339 --> 00:32:46.380
Caption: what health orders were changing

00:32:44.038 --> 00:32:48.599
Caption: but sign language interpretation is not

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:50.579
Caption: the only way to make things accessible

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:51.959
Caption: to people who are deaf or hard of

00:32:50.579 --> 00:32:53.939
Caption: hearing

00:32:51.959 --> 00:32:56.158
Caption: you also want to look at things like

00:32:53.939 --> 00:32:58.199
Caption: captions and a lot of people will do

00:32:56.159 --> 00:32:59.580
Caption: that using automated captioning

00:32:58.199 --> 00:33:02.339
Caption: Solutions

00:32:59.579 --> 00:33:04.140
Caption: which can be great until they&#39;re not as

00:33:02.339 --> 00:33:06.719
Caption: illustrated by this tweet from Kell

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.700
Caption: Montgomery a disability activist beta

00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:10.918
Caption: based out of the US

00:33:08.699 --> 00:33:13.439
Caption: if you value US equally and want us to

00:33:10.918 --> 00:33:15.298
Caption: participate fully we need full access to

00:33:13.439 --> 00:33:16.918
Caption: the Paul say briefing with enough lead

00:33:15.298 --> 00:33:19.260
Caption: time to absorb it

00:33:16.918 --> 00:33:20.819
Caption: that chance is gone for this year which

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.380
Caption: means that you have just sabotaged your

00:33:20.819 --> 00:33:24.418
Caption: own legislative agenda by leaving

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:27.000
Caption: Advocates unprepared

00:33:24.418 --> 00:33:29.099
Caption: Now cal here was referring to one of the

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.339
Caption: biggest disability organizations in the

00:33:29.099 --> 00:33:34.619
Caption: U.S who had run an event the Paul say

00:33:32.339 --> 00:33:36.898
Caption: briefing and if you&#39;re wondering what

00:33:34.619 --> 00:33:39.359
Caption: Paul say means that&#39;s how the automated

00:33:36.899 --> 00:33:41.039
Caption: captioning solution that they said was

00:33:39.359 --> 00:33:44.339
Caption: adequate for people to access that

00:33:41.038 --> 00:33:46.798
Caption: briefing rendered the term policy

00:33:44.339 --> 00:33:48.418
Caption: the rest of the the rest of the

00:33:46.798 --> 00:33:50.038
Caption: transcript of the briefing was similarly

00:33:48.418 --> 00:33:52.500
Caption: garbled

00:33:50.038 --> 00:33:54.359
Caption: now that&#39;s actually not that hard to

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:57.119
Caption: solve it just requires a bit of human

00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:58.739
Caption: review afterwards and one group of

00:33:57.119 --> 00:34:00.658
Caption: people that do this really well are the

00:33:58.739 --> 00:34:02.939
Caption: podcasts This American Life which is

00:34:00.659 --> 00:34:04.019
Caption: backed by national public radio in the

00:34:02.939 --> 00:34:05.819
Caption: US

00:34:04.019 --> 00:34:07.859
Caption: they do have a note on their website

00:34:05.819 --> 00:34:10.319
Caption: that says This American Life is produced

00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:12.540
Caption: for the ear and designed to be heard

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.280
Caption: but they produce transcripts which are

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.800
Caption: run through an automated transcription

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:19.080
Caption: engine and then corrected manually by

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.418
Caption: human captioners and what that means is

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:23.459
Caption: that if you are deaf if you are hard of

00:34:21.418 --> 00:34:25.138
Caption: hearing or if you have auditory

00:34:23.459 --> 00:34:27.658
Caption: processing issues or for any other

00:34:25.138 --> 00:34:29.338
Caption: reason are text Reliant you can go

00:34:27.658 --> 00:34:30.780
Caption: through and read through that transcript

00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:33.020
Caption: and it will provide you with all of the

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.020
Caption: information

00:34:33.118 --> 00:34:37.439
Caption: one group of people that don&#39;t do this

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:39.898
Caption: quite so well are Guardian Australia and

00:34:37.439 --> 00:34:42.060
Caption: this is relevant because they produced

00:34:39.898 --> 00:34:44.520
Caption: one of the better sources of information

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:46.320
Caption: in audio form about what was actually

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.719
Caption: going on in terms of health roundups and

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.520
Caption: things during the covid-19 pandemic

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:51.898
Caption: but their approach to transcribing

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.780
Caption: things can be described with this

00:34:51.898 --> 00:34:56.040
Caption: headline here Guardian podcasts why no

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.839
Caption: transcripts

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:01.500
Caption: that is to say that their approach is to

00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:04.260
Caption: not transcribe anything at all

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.899
Caption: which means that if you are deaf or hard

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.639
Caption: of hearing or otherwise text Reliant you

00:35:06.899 --> 00:35:10.139
Caption: cannot actually access any of the

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:12.539
Caption: material that Guardian Australia

00:35:10.139 --> 00:35:14.760
Caption: produces in audio form

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:16.859
Caption: oops

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:19.199
Caption: and this is also important because text

00:35:16.858 --> 00:35:21.118
Caption: Reliant people aren&#39;t necessarily deaf

00:35:19.199 --> 00:35:23.939
Caption: or hard of hearing autistic people

00:35:21.118 --> 00:35:26.399
Caption: people with ADHD people with sensory

00:35:23.939 --> 00:35:28.379
Caption: processing disorders people who are on a

00:35:26.399 --> 00:35:30.539
Caption: busy train and want to be able to read

00:35:28.379 --> 00:35:32.939
Caption: information rather than listening to it

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:35.099
Caption: people with disorders like tinnitus

00:35:32.939 --> 00:35:36.419
Caption: which affect the hearing in situational

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:38.339
Caption: manners

00:35:36.419 --> 00:35:40.618
Caption: are all going to find themselves text

00:35:38.339 --> 00:35:42.960
Caption: Reliant at some point or another even if

00:35:40.618 --> 00:35:44.819
Caption: it&#39;s not all the time

00:35:42.959 --> 00:35:46.739
Caption: so how do we improve it

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.540
Caption: you want to provide transcripts for any

00:35:46.739 --> 00:35:50.159
Caption: spoken audio on your website and you

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.380
Caption: want to make sure that you caption any

00:35:50.159 --> 00:35:54.539
Caption: videos but do bear in mind that

00:35:52.379 --> 00:35:56.939
Caption: automated transcription software is not

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.859
Caption: a complete solution if you get a human

00:35:56.939 --> 00:36:00.358
Caption: to correct the transcription before it&#39;s

00:35:58.858 --> 00:36:01.559
Caption: published you&#39;re going to produce

00:36:00.358 --> 00:36:03.719
Caption: something that people can actually

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.400
Caption: access

00:36:03.719 --> 00:36:07.618
Caption: and the captions which were done by

00:36:05.399 --> 00:36:09.179
Caption: Netflix for stranger things sort of made

00:36:07.618 --> 00:36:11.159
Caption: their way around the internet multiple

00:36:09.179 --> 00:36:12.959
Caption: times because they did a lot of other

00:36:11.159 --> 00:36:14.819
Caption: things really well in terms of

00:36:12.959 --> 00:36:16.618
Caption: describing changes in vocal tone and

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.599
Caption: background noise if you&#39;re producing

00:36:16.618 --> 00:36:22.439
Caption: particularly video content or complex

00:36:18.599 --> 00:36:25.859

00:36:22.439 --> 00:36:27.959
Caption: acting in artificial pancreas now that

00:36:25.858 --> 00:36:29.399
Caption: can be read in two different ways we can

00:36:27.959 --> 00:36:31.500
Caption: talk about hacking together an

00:36:29.399 --> 00:36:34.199
Caption: artificial pancreas or we can talk about

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:37.379
Caption: hacking into an artificial pancreas

00:36:34.199 --> 00:36:39.838
Caption: but this case study actually covers both

00:36:37.379 --> 00:36:41.879
Caption: this is a Medtronic mini-med insulin

00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:44.460
Caption: pump it is used by people who are

00:36:41.879 --> 00:36:47.159
Caption: insulin dependent with diabetes

00:36:44.459 --> 00:36:48.899
Caption: basically the pump sits just under your

00:36:47.159 --> 00:36:52.139
Caption: skin you plug it in and it delivers

00:36:48.899 --> 00:36:54.059
Caption: insulin at regular intervals without you

00:36:52.139 --> 00:36:56.039
Caption: having to inject yourself that&#39;s really

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.900
Caption: good for a lot of people

00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:00.300
Caption: there&#39;s also been another recent

00:36:57.899 --> 00:37:01.979
Caption: invention of the constant blood glucose

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.739
Caption: monitor

00:37:01.979 --> 00:37:06.239
Caption: and that again similarly sits just below

00:37:04.739 --> 00:37:09.118
Caption: your skin provides information on what

00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:11.219
Caption: your blood glucose is all the time and

00:37:09.118 --> 00:37:13.139
Caption: these Medtronic minimet insulin pumps

00:37:11.219 --> 00:37:15.780
Caption: had a really interesting security flaw

00:37:13.139 --> 00:37:18.118
Caption: which resulted in a lot of people with

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.760
Caption: diabetes hunting them down because what

00:37:18.118 --> 00:37:23.519
Caption: you could do is there was an unsecured

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.679
Caption: radio frequency which was used by the

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:27.419
Caption: remote but you could also hook that up

00:37:25.679 --> 00:37:29.639
Caption: with a bridge between it and a little

00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:32.159
Caption: bit of open source source code

00:37:29.639 --> 00:37:34.078
Caption: to a constant blood glucose monitor and

00:37:32.159 --> 00:37:36.719
Caption: have the insulin pump react and deliver

00:37:34.079 --> 00:37:37.800
Caption: insulin at various intervals based on

00:37:36.719 --> 00:37:39.780
Caption: that

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.000
Caption: but the problem is

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:44.280
Caption: that security flaws always come with

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.320
Caption: other issues and the fact that you could

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.179
Caption: hook in Via this piece of source code

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.800
Caption: also meant that your Medtronic MiniMed

00:37:48.179 --> 00:37:51.719
Caption: insulin pump was potentially vulnerable

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.520
Caption: to hacker attacks

00:37:51.719 --> 00:37:55.379
Caption: which is not great because that allows

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.719
Caption: you to actually modify the amount of

00:37:55.379 --> 00:38:00.000
Caption: insulin that you give to someone

00:37:57.719 --> 00:38:01.379
Caption: so the FDA the drug regulator in the US

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.358
Caption: were made aware of this and they went

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:05.819
Caption: away and issued an alert on it

00:38:03.358 --> 00:38:07.199
Caption: but there were a few enterprising hacker

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.520
Caption: types in the healthcare industry who

00:38:07.199 --> 00:38:11.040
Caption: didn&#39;t think that they were taking this

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.719
Caption: very seriously so they got out their

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.760
Caption: phones and they did a little bit of

00:38:12.719 --> 00:38:16.739
Caption: coding and they produced an Android app

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.199
Caption: which you could use to hook into that

00:38:16.739 --> 00:38:21.239
Caption: really common frequency on any Medtronic

00:38:19.199 --> 00:38:23.760
Caption: mini-med insulin pump in the immediate

00:38:21.239 --> 00:38:25.739
Caption: vicinity and either entirely withhold

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:28.260
Caption: insulin from its user or deliver a

00:38:25.739 --> 00:38:30.839
Caption: lethal dose of insulin immediately

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:32.159
Caption: which finally resulted in Medtronic

00:38:30.839 --> 00:38:33.900
Caption: recalling their vulnerable Mini Med

00:38:32.159 --> 00:38:36.358
Caption: insulin pumps

00:38:33.899 --> 00:38:38.459
Caption: oh dear

00:38:36.358 --> 00:38:40.500
Caption: and this is where we get into the fact

00:38:38.459 --> 00:38:43.800
Caption: that accessibility is not just about web

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:46.139
Caption: accessibility in some scenarios security

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:49.079
Caption: issues and many other types of issues

00:38:46.139 --> 00:38:51.000
Caption: can actually be accessibility problems

00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:54.479
Caption: medical devices you&#39;re dealing with

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.800
Caption: people&#39;s lives it&#39;s really important and

00:38:54.479 --> 00:38:57.239
Caption: what&#39;s more problematic is that if

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.760
Caption: you&#39;re regulated by an external

00:38:57.239 --> 00:39:02.098
Caption: organization like the FDA you may not

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.839
Caption: hear about these issues quickly in some

00:39:02.099 --> 00:39:05.880
Caption: scenarios you may not actually hear

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:08.400
Caption: about them at all

00:39:05.879 --> 00:39:10.078
Caption: so how do we improve this you want to

00:39:08.399 --> 00:39:12.179
Caption: start by considering the possible attack

00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:14.880
Caption: factors a lot of this is just good basic

00:39:12.179 --> 00:39:17.338
Caption: security get a good pen testing company

00:39:14.879 --> 00:39:19.379
Caption: in particularly Hardware pen testers for

00:39:17.339 --> 00:39:21.239
Caption: stuff like medical devices before your

00:39:19.379 --> 00:39:23.159
Caption: device goes to Market

00:39:21.239 --> 00:39:24.899
Caption: and make sure that if people notify you

00:39:23.159 --> 00:39:26.760
Caption: about security vulnerabilities you

00:39:24.899 --> 00:39:28.739
Caption: respond promptly

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.839
Caption: because the really sad thing about this

00:39:28.739 --> 00:39:33.060
Caption: use case is that unintended users can

00:39:30.839 --> 00:39:35.339
Caption: actually be a business opportunity and

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:37.920
Caption: Medtronic weren&#39;t the ones that ended up

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:40.079
Caption: capitalizing on it there were a couple

00:39:37.919 --> 00:39:42.959
Caption: of different companies who saw these

00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:45.359
Caption: issues and produced secure insulin pumps

00:39:42.959 --> 00:39:47.399
Caption: which were set up properly which you

00:39:45.358 --> 00:39:49.379
Caption: could use to hook into derivatives of

00:39:47.399 --> 00:39:52.078
Caption: that original source code on a secure

00:39:49.379 --> 00:39:55.338
Caption: channel to produce your closed loop

00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:55.339
Caption: insulin delivery system

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.219
Caption: and this is where we get to my favorite

00:39:57.479 --> 00:40:01.260
Caption: case study of the bunch because this is

00:39:59.219 --> 00:40:05.459
Caption: another one that concerns me

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:07.859
Caption: I have been giving this talk since 2019.

00:40:05.459 --> 00:40:09.118
Caption: and when I realized that I was going to

00:40:07.858 --> 00:40:10.858
Caption: be talking to people a lot about

00:40:09.118 --> 00:40:13.019
Caption: accessibility when I became an

00:40:10.858 --> 00:40:15.779
Caption: accidental accessibility advocate

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:18.000
Caption: I went okay I&#39;ve got to find some way of

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:20.339
Caption: making sure that I know about what is

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.839
Caption: going on in the accessibility world and

00:40:20.339 --> 00:40:23.339
Caption: one way that I did that was through my

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:25.260
Caption: LinkedIn feed

00:40:23.339 --> 00:40:27.359
Caption: so I was looking a lot of information

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:30.118
Caption: about accessibility I was following the

00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:31.559
Caption: accessibility hashtag and one day I was

00:40:30.118 --> 00:40:33.419
Caption: going through my LinkedIn feed and a

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:35.099
Caption: post popped up saying there&#39;s an

00:40:33.419 --> 00:40:37.439
Caption: accessibility consultant that&#39;s giving a

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:39.300
Caption: talk about accessibility on this date at

00:40:37.439 --> 00:40:42.179
Caption: this time at this venue

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:44.160
Caption: and I went great cool I know some things

00:40:42.179 --> 00:40:45.719
Caption: about accessibility I know quite a lot

00:40:44.159 --> 00:40:48.118
Caption: about the things that are directly

00:40:45.719 --> 00:40:49.618
Caption: applicable to me as well as more about

00:40:48.118 --> 00:40:52.019
Caption: the things that are applicable to my

00:40:49.618 --> 00:40:54.779
Caption: friends people that I know but there&#39;s

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:56.760
Caption: always something that you can learn from

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:59.339
Caption: scenarios like this

00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.139
Caption: so I go along I get off work at 4 30 I

00:40:59.339 --> 00:41:03.900
Caption: take the train to venue

00:41:01.139 --> 00:41:05.819
Caption: to see this

00:41:03.899 --> 00:41:08.039
Caption: that&#39;s a set of steps

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:09.540
Caption: that wasn&#39;t the only set of stairs to

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.239
Caption: get into the building there were in fact

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:14.880
Caption: three similar sets of stairs that one

00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:16.979
Caption: and two more after the glass door to get

00:41:14.879 --> 00:41:20.159
Caption: to the lift which would then take you up

00:41:16.979 --> 00:41:21.959
Caption: to where the event was being held

00:41:20.159 --> 00:41:24.479
Caption: and I described this to a couple of

00:41:21.959 --> 00:41:26.338
Caption: friends of mine as being like a Roomba

00:41:24.479 --> 00:41:28.858
Caption: just sitting at the bottom of a set of

00:41:26.339 --> 00:41:30.720
Caption: stairs repeatedly shouting error 406

00:41:28.858 --> 00:41:33.358
Caption: which for those of you who are not well

00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:35.699
Caption: versed in HTML error codes means not

00:41:33.358 --> 00:41:38.219
Caption: acceptable

00:41:35.699 --> 00:41:41.159
Caption: so I get up there I listen to the whole

00:41:38.219 --> 00:41:42.899
Caption: talk and I had basically crawled up I I

00:41:41.159 --> 00:41:44.639
Caption: basically called up the last flight of

00:41:42.899 --> 00:41:46.379
Caption: stairs to get there

00:41:44.639 --> 00:41:48.779
Caption: and I said to the accessibility

00:41:46.379 --> 00:41:50.459
Caption: consultant does it strike you as ironic

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.500
Caption: that you&#39;re giving a talk about web

00:41:50.459 --> 00:41:54.540
Caption: accessibility in a venue that&#39;s

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.379
Caption: inaccessible and he looks at me and he

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.880
Caption: goes

00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:58.979
Caption: you know I hadn&#39;t really thought about

00:41:56.879 --> 00:42:02.219
Caption: that

00:41:58.979 --> 00:42:04.439
Caption: and I don&#39;t think that I need to explain

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:06.479
Caption: the irony here but we&#39;re going to do the

00:42:04.439 --> 00:42:08.760
Caption: postmortem anyway

00:42:06.479 --> 00:42:10.560
Caption: so if you&#39;re running events and full

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.540
Caption: credit to DDD perk here because they&#39;ve

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.739
Caption: done a brilliant job of this you want to

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.300
Caption: make sure that your venues are

00:42:13.739 --> 00:42:17.699
Caption: wheelchair accessible you want to make

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:19.800
Caption: sure that they have disabled bathrooms I

00:42:17.699 --> 00:42:21.419
Caption: so many times I have gone to events to

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:23.520
Caption: find that the disabled bathrooms are on

00:42:21.419 --> 00:42:25.260
Caption: a different floor or they&#39;re locked or

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.060
Caption: no one knows where they are or you&#39;ve

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:30.179
Caption: got to go and talk to security to

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:32.459
Caption: actually get the key

00:42:30.179 --> 00:42:33.899
Caption: but there are more advanced types of

00:42:32.459 --> 00:42:35.820
Caption: things that you can do which help people

00:42:33.899 --> 00:42:37.618
Caption: with a variety of different disabilities

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:39.420
Caption: so you want to look at things like

00:42:37.618 --> 00:42:41.338
Caption: providing quiet spaces for people which

00:42:39.419 --> 00:42:44.159
Caption: again is something that DDD Perth has

00:42:41.339 --> 00:42:45.780
Caption: done and making sure that there is a lot

00:42:44.159 --> 00:42:48.838
Caption: of different adaptive technology around

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:51.959
Caption: so sign language interpreters if you&#39;ve

00:42:48.839 --> 00:42:53.640
Caption: got hearing loops one of my friends has

00:42:51.959 --> 00:42:55.800
Caption: been hard of hearing basically her whole

00:42:53.639 --> 00:42:58.858
Caption: life when got fitted with a hearing aid

00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:01.079
Caption: in her 40s and she called me up and she

00:42:58.858 --> 00:43:02.578
Caption: said Dawn I am so happy because For the

00:43:01.079 --> 00:43:04.680
Caption: First Time I can hear the announcements

00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:05.880
Caption: at the train station when I turn on my

00:43:04.679 --> 00:43:08.040
Caption: hearing aid and I plug it into the

00:43:05.879 --> 00:43:09.539
Caption: hearing Loop

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.339
Caption: and things like you know audio

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.599
Caption: descriptions of slides you&#39;ll see as I

00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:14.099
Caption: go through this talk I&#39;ve tried to

00:43:12.599 --> 00:43:16.380
Caption: describe everything that&#39;s on the slides

00:43:14.099 --> 00:43:17.940
Caption: as I go but what&#39;s really important here

00:43:16.379 --> 00:43:19.979
Caption: is making sure that you include people

00:43:17.939 --> 00:43:22.618
Caption: with disabilities in discussions about

00:43:19.979 --> 00:43:24.899
Caption: accessibility and if you don&#39;t know

00:43:22.618 --> 00:43:26.279
Caption: whether people with disabilities are the

00:43:24.899 --> 00:43:28.500
Caption: question that you need to ask yourself

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.140
Caption: and again this is not just applicable to

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.118
Caption: disability is who&#39;s not in the room and

00:43:31.139 --> 00:43:34.979
Caption: why aren&#39;t they here because sometimes

00:43:33.118 --> 00:43:36.539
Caption: the reason why they aren&#39;t here is going

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:38.399
Caption: to be as simple as three flights of

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:41.819
Caption: stairs into the venue

00:43:38.399 --> 00:43:44.459
Caption: so to recap accessibility benefits

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:46.920
Caption: everyone not just disabled people

00:43:44.459 --> 00:43:48.780
Caption: and you can do this really well by

00:43:46.919 --> 00:43:51.780
Caption: building accessibility into your design

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:53.640
Caption: principles from the start but it&#39;s not

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:56.339
Caption: just about the web accessibility piece

00:43:53.639 --> 00:43:58.919
Caption: other issues like security risks can

00:43:56.339 --> 00:44:01.260
Caption: also be accessibility issues you need to

00:43:58.919 --> 00:44:04.639
Caption: make an individualized assessment based

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:04.639
Caption: on what it is that you&#39;re trying to do

00:44:04.739 --> 00:44:08.339
Caption: excuse me my slides are stuffing up

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:10.439
Caption: again

00:44:08.339 --> 00:44:12.000
Caption: thorough testing is really important and

00:44:10.439 --> 00:44:13.919
Caption: the best case scenario is that you can

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.540
Caption: get adaptive technology users to test

00:44:13.919 --> 00:44:17.520
Caption: your software themselves but if you

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:19.020
Caption: can&#39;t think about the things that

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:21.899
Caption: disabled people might need to do

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:23.579
Caption: differently and most importantly

00:44:21.899 --> 00:44:25.439
Caption: regardless of whether they have

00:44:23.579 --> 00:44:26.880
Caption: accessibility needs or not listen to

00:44:25.439 --> 00:44:29.280
Caption: your users

00:44:26.879 --> 00:44:31.259
Caption: I do want to give a couple of thanks to

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.179
Caption: Melissa who did my former colleague who

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.859
Caption: did the fancy website mock-ups for me

00:44:33.179 --> 00:44:36.540
Caption: Matt for the atlassian Confluence

00:44:34.858 --> 00:44:38.039
Caption: screenshots and my friend Annie who

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.419
Caption: produced the accessibility Roomba

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.500
Caption: drawing

00:44:39.419 --> 00:44:42.899
Caption: we&#39;re not going to have time for

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:45.679
Caption: questions I&#39;ll be around I have colored

00:44:42.899 --> 00:44:48.779

00:44:50.699 --> 00:44:54.060
Caption: the talks that I&#39;ve previously done and

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.219
Caption: I&#39;ve done a million different talks on

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:58.859
Caption: accessibility but it was amazing to be

00:44:56.219 --> 00:45:01.139
Caption: here to do this in person for a group of

00:44:58.858 --> 00:45:03.299
Caption: people for the first time and thank you

00:45:01.139 --> 00:45:05.699
