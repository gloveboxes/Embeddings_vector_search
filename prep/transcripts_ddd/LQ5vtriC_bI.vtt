Caption: you&#39;re talking to it and changing it

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.359
Caption: okay as opposed to trying to read

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.319
Caption: through and understand it you bring it

00:00:23.358 --> 00:00:26.319

Caption: you&#39;re asked to draw a landscape this is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.760

Caption: okay so i&#39;m going to start there

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.520
Caption: all right and this is my journey

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:03.359
Caption: so about 10 years ago

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.080
Caption: um i was using physical whiteboards

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.760
Caption: and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.919
Caption: these are the sort of things i was you

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.720
Caption: know putting up on the screen

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:11.118
Caption: um

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.360
Caption: pretty bland but i guess i got the um

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.280
Caption: the the message across as to what we&#39;re

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.239
Caption: trying to do

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:18.720
Caption: okay

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:21.279
Caption: um and about 2012

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.599
Caption: i i wanted to start taking digital notes

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:25.759
Caption: and and using a tablet so i bought a

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:28.400
Caption: stylus optimized tablet

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.880
Caption: 2012 the apple pencil still didn&#39;t exist

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.559
Caption: you were told to use a finger

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:35.919
Caption: and

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:39.118
Caption: so i bought an android tablet and

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:40.400
Caption: i it never really worked well

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.119
Caption: um but

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.959
Caption: i i just persisted i went through about

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.399
Caption: four different android tablets with

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.399
Caption: styluses

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.399
Caption: um but my

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.799
Caption: my drawing on a tablet

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.600
Caption: looked worse than it did on a whiteboard

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.920
Caption: okay but i was using it

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.919
Caption: then

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.719
Caption: this happened

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.879
Caption: okay and everyone stopped going into an

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.880
Caption: office and i no longer had access to a

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:09.679
Caption: whiteboard

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:12.238
Caption: um but we had zoom

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.399
Caption: and all of a sudden a tablet with a pen

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:15.598
Caption: became really really handy

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:17.439
Caption: i could

00:02:15.598 --> 00:02:18.399
Caption: you know join the zoom meeting with my

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.878
Caption: tablet

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:22.799
Caption: and i could draw kind of like on a

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:25.360
Caption: whiteboard but i was still pretty crap

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.440
Caption: at drawing okay still really crap at

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.720
Caption: drawing but at least i was able to do

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.360
Caption: something

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.399
Caption: and then early last year i changed jobs

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.199
Caption: and i started working for with confluent

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:39.119
Caption: and as a as an organization for their

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.720
Caption: solutions engineers of which i&#39;m a

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:45.199
Caption: solutions engineer

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.000
Caption: um they had enabled um their workforce

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:50.479
Caption: with an ipad with an app called concepts

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.319
Caption: that i hadn&#39;t used before

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.518
Caption: and some other tools and i&#39;ll go through

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.319
Caption: the tools

00:02:53.518 --> 00:02:55.440
Caption: and

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.878
Caption: it was a little bit eye opening i

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.598
Caption: thought wow this is really cool this

00:02:56.878 --> 00:03:01.360
Caption: this actually works so if i show you

00:02:59.598 --> 00:03:03.518
Caption: um

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.839
Caption: i guess what my white boards

00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:08.800
Caption: look like within about a month of

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:10.958
Caption: starting working with those tools

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.878
Caption: at uh at confluence so

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:15.199
Caption: definitely improved right i&#39;m starting

00:03:12.878 --> 00:03:16.958
Caption: to to to draw things out now one of the

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:19.039
Caption: nice things about concepts and i i&#39;m

00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:20.399
Caption: going to say if you&#39;ve got a an ipad

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.479
Caption: even if you&#39;ve got android concepts

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.759
Caption: works on the android but the documents

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.839
Caption: aren&#39;t compatible between them and

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:28.319
Caption: there&#39;s it&#39;s sort of a couple of

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:31.199
Caption: versions behind on android

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.518
Caption: it&#39;s still okay all right but um

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:36.080
Caption: the infinite canvas so i can scroll left

00:03:33.518 --> 00:03:37.919
Caption: right out in it it&#39;s just good to be

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.319
Caption: able to you know

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:43.039
Caption: zoom into detail like i&#39;m doing here

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.319
Caption: okay and then about two months after i

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.360
Caption: joined

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.518

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.680
Caption: someone new come into leadership and she

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:51.279
Caption: suggested because we were all using this

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:53.359
Caption: that we should maybe do some training in

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:56.238
Caption: it and

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.119
Caption: i attended a two-day workshop

00:03:56.238 --> 00:03:59.518
Caption: on

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:01.279

Caption: that runs these courses so um they&#39;re

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.639
Caption: quite expensive it&#39;s about fifteen

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:22.320
Caption: hundred dollars if you can get your

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.000

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:30.159
Caption: i&#39;m gonna show you these drawings here

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:33.599
Caption: that i started this this morning

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.959
Caption: um that&#39;s using the picablo sort of

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.119
Caption: technique

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:40.079
Caption: all right and this this kind of really

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:41.199
Caption: um took off for me right so

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:44.720
Caption: my

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:48.080
Caption: my drawing just changed and it it

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.320
Caption: it changed on a sort of a rapid

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:55.000
Caption: progression

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.000
Caption: so i will go into the tools

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.320
Caption: so with digital

00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:02.720
Caption: i have an ipad

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.639
Caption: and drawing with a pencil on an ipad if

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.479
Caption: you&#39;ve got one it&#39;s it&#39;s not very good

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.720
Caption: it sort of slips and slides everywhere

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.559
Caption: um samsung with their

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.479
Caption: stylus is much much better i much prefer

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:13.839
Caption: to note take on a samsung style on a

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.679
Caption: samsung tablet

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:18.320
Caption: and and i use that in meetings so i

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:19.919
Caption: typically carry a macbook my ipad and a

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.160
Caption: samsung tablet so

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.959
Caption: lots of things to keep charged

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.080
Caption: it gets better if you put a screen

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:28.559
Caption: protector

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:31.198
Caption: on the glass and you can get this one

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:32.639
Caption: off of amazon it&#39;s called uh it&#39;s from

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.800
Caption: belmond

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.320
Caption: it&#39;s about 25 for two

00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:38.478
Caption: screen protectors

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.160
Caption: and it gives it a bit of a matte finish

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.919
Caption: so it feels more like writing on paper

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.199
Caption: they&#39;ve tried to emulate their paper

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.600
Caption: with the pencil

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:49.119
Caption: so i would recommend it

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.559
Caption: and of course the concepts app this is a

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:52.479
Caption: really good app

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:53.759
Caption: and if you have problems their support&#39;s

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.959
Caption: really good there&#39;s only a small team

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.320
Caption: out of

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:58.319
Caption: california that write this

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.399
Caption: and then lastly

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.360
Caption: you don&#39;t

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.039
Caption: need this and i could show you how this

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:12.399
Caption: works except my macbook&#39;s at the back of

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:15.199
Caption: the room so i can&#39;t uh it basically is a

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:17.600
Caption: airplay receiver running on your macbook

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:21.600
Caption: so that i can present

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.520
Caption: from my ipad up here or wherever it is

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.959
Caption: onto a screen somewhere with a hdmi

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:27.279
Caption: cable

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:29.519
Caption: okay so that&#39;s digital

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:29.519
Caption: now

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.239
Caption: with paper

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.799
Caption: um

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:40.879
Caption: if you do the buckler course and you

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:43.198
Caption: don&#39;t have to do it but if you do it you

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.639
Caption: get one of these sort of packs

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:48.800
Caption: and you get these refillable pens

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.479
Caption: from newland and they have like hundreds

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:52.239
Caption: of colors they have them for paper they

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.800
Caption: have them for white boards

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:56.319
Caption: um very large tips for doing shading and

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:58.000
Caption: things so they&#39;re really good if you

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.559
Caption: sort of you know

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.639
Caption: if your work is in a room and you are

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:04.399
Caption: you know doing sort of agile

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.520
Caption: facilitation and you want to draw out a

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:07.279
Caption: journey or something like that and

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:08.319
Caption: you&#39;re doing it on paper these are

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:10.479
Caption: really good much better than what you

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:11.839
Caption: can get from an office works

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:13.360
Caption: okay

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:14.399
Caption: they&#39;re expensive and you can buy them

00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:15.359
Caption: online

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:17.199
Caption: also

00:07:15.359 --> 00:07:19.679
Caption: with actually i&#39;ll show that later i&#39;ll

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:21.520
Caption: leave that for now

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:22.799
Caption: okay

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:25.198
Caption: and again i&#39;ve also i&#39;ve already

00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:28.000
Caption: mentioned this but uh

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:29.119
Caption: with whiteboards again the newland

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.039
Caption: markers

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:32.639
Caption: and i&#39;m going to suggest that if you&#39;re

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:35.119
Caption: buying markers

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:38.000
Caption: buy the ones that have

00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:39.440
Caption: the sort of rectangular tips

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Caption: yep chisel tip is that what it&#39;s called

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.000
Caption: cool there you go learn something

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.839
Caption: so you can use both edges right so my

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.199
Caption: little people here they just sort of

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:51.279
Caption: emulated it on my tablet is the wide one

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:53.598
Caption: to draw the bodies and a narrow one to

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:55.519
Caption: draw the heads and arms

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:56.799
Caption: so

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:57.598
Caption: all right

00:07:56.799 --> 00:07:59.598
Caption: so

00:07:57.598 --> 00:08:02.319
Caption: now this is a follow along

00:07:59.598 --> 00:08:02.319
Caption: how to draw

00:08:02.559 --> 00:08:04.878
Caption: okay

00:08:05.359 --> 00:08:08.559
Caption: so

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:09.758
Caption: please uh copy me if you want to

00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:10.720
Caption: right

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:13.839
Caption: lines

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.839
Caption: these are simple

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:16.720
Caption: all right

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:26.199
Caption: easy

00:08:28.878 --> 00:08:31.759
Caption: getting a bit harder

00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:38.640
Caption: so these newland pens

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.000
Caption: have places for your

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.320
Caption: your fingers so you&#39;re always holding it

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.518
Caption: the right way so that tip touches the

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.518
Caption: paper the way it&#39;s supposed to

00:08:49.518 --> 00:08:53.518
Caption: and i&#39;m never good at making circles

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:55.599
Caption: circles but that&#39;s that one that one

00:08:53.518 --> 00:08:57.919
Caption: turned out pretty good

00:08:55.599 --> 00:08:57.919
Caption: all right

00:08:58.398 --> 00:09:01.880
Caption: squiggly shapes

00:09:19.518 --> 00:09:23.440
Caption: and

00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:26.239
Caption: the last ones

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.239
Caption: are the other shapes

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:30.559
Caption: all right

00:09:31.599 --> 00:09:34.398
Caption: my shark fin

00:09:35.278 --> 00:09:38.479
Caption: and the letter u

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:41.599
Caption: so

00:09:39.838 --> 00:09:42.719
Caption: if you can do all those shapes you can

00:09:41.599 --> 00:09:43.919
Caption: draw

00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:45.278
Caption: all of the

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:47.359
Caption: picablo

00:09:45.278 --> 00:09:50.359
Caption: symbols

00:09:47.359 --> 00:09:50.359
Caption: so

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:55.398
Caption: like that

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.958
Caption: all right very quick to draw something

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.958
Caption: and of course

00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:25.320
Caption: shading helps

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:40.159
Caption: all right

00:10:37.518 --> 00:10:43.119
Caption: so here&#39;s some other shapes

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:46.759
Caption: and again you&#39;ll see them all in

00:10:43.119 --> 00:10:46.760
Caption: the picture shapes

00:10:50.479 --> 00:10:53.679
Caption: and again

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:57.639
Caption: coloring shading

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:57.640
Caption: really changes the way they look

00:11:00.239 --> 00:11:03.200
Caption: so let&#39;s draw some more

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.078
Caption: try these

00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:13.320
Caption: okay and

00:11:10.078 --> 00:11:13.320
Caption: for these

00:11:15.838 --> 00:11:18.239
Caption: all right

00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.838
Caption: our shark fin

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:25.359
Caption: okay

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.599
Caption: can you see i&#39;ve got some no you can&#39;t

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.119
Caption: see it at all i&#39;ve got some cheats on

00:11:29.599 --> 00:11:33.679
Caption: there it&#39;s turned out it&#39;s very good

00:11:31.119 --> 00:11:33.679
Caption: right so

00:11:41.518 --> 00:11:44.880
Caption: a meeting between two people

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.760
Caption: now matsu

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.040
Caption: let me draw matsu

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.398
Caption: right but i&#39;m going to do in a different

00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:56.799
Caption: order i&#39;m going to do the o

00:11:54.398 --> 00:11:59.440
Caption: i&#39;m going to do the m

00:11:56.799 --> 00:12:01.919
Caption: i&#39;m going to do a u

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.919
Caption: and a z

00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.760
Caption: i&#39;ll do them on the screen

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.480
Caption: just check my pens working here

00:12:41.359 --> 00:12:44.359
Caption: ah

00:12:58.398 --> 00:13:00.719
Caption: okay

00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:06.559
Caption: all right shading

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:08.239
Caption: now containers

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:09.838
Caption: when drawing containers and actually i

00:13:08.239 --> 00:13:12.078
Caption: won&#39;t do it on the white on the on the

00:13:09.838 --> 00:13:12.078
Caption: uh

00:13:12.398 --> 00:13:16.078
Caption: right

00:13:13.599 --> 00:13:17.838
Caption: draw the words

00:13:16.078 --> 00:13:22.078
Caption: then draw the box around it if you draw

00:13:17.838 --> 00:13:22.078
Caption: the box first your words won&#39;t fit

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.078
Caption: okay

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.479
Caption: all right

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.958
Caption: so you know just being able to all right

00:13:30.479 --> 00:13:35.359
Caption: i&#39;m drawing an architectural diagram and

00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.638
Caption: i&#39;ve got a secure area dropping a

00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:38.239
Caption: dropping a lock

00:13:36.638 --> 00:13:41.518
Caption: in a corner that&#39;s either locked or

00:13:38.239 --> 00:13:43.919
Caption: unlocked you can draw that in 10 seconds

00:13:41.518 --> 00:13:46.479
Caption: just to to make it you know

00:13:43.919 --> 00:13:49.838
Caption: much easier than writing a secure zone

00:13:46.479 --> 00:13:49.838
Caption: right or unsecured zone

00:13:51.359 --> 00:13:53.838
Caption: so

00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.679
Caption: um

00:13:53.838 --> 00:13:57.039
Caption: i got these two books when i did the

00:13:55.679 --> 00:14:00.239
Caption: training

00:13:57.039 --> 00:14:02.559
Caption: and um they they basically talk through

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:03.838
Caption: lots of different techniques and shapes

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:06.159
Caption: and everything

00:14:03.838 --> 00:14:09.518
Caption: i&#39;ve just taken two photos just so you

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:11.359
Caption: can see some of the the symbols

00:14:09.518 --> 00:14:12.880
Caption: i&#39;ve drawn some already today you would

00:14:11.359 --> 00:14:16.039
Caption: have seen

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.039
Caption: all right

00:14:22.479 --> 00:14:26.159
Caption: so i&#39;m going to draw people now

00:14:27.838 --> 00:14:31.119
Caption: because this really comes down to how

00:14:29.198 --> 00:14:33.359
Caption: much time you want to spend

00:14:31.119 --> 00:14:34.958
Caption: so it could be as simple as an upside

00:14:33.359 --> 00:14:37.039
Caption: down u and a line

00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.398
Caption: and it looks like a person right a

00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:40.159
Caption: little bit of shading helps it even if

00:14:38.398 --> 00:14:42.398
Caption: you&#39;re doing that on the you know on the

00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:44.958
Caption: run

00:14:42.398 --> 00:14:46.479
Caption: you don&#39;t need to put arms but when we

00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.838
Caption: draw stick figures you know our arms

00:14:46.479 --> 00:14:49.518
Caption: don&#39;t come out of our tummies they come

00:14:47.838 --> 00:14:53.518
Caption: out from under our necks

00:14:49.518 --> 00:14:53.518
Caption: so you draw your arms at the top

00:14:54.719 --> 00:14:59.518
Caption: you know you can start to do

00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:01.039
Caption: actions like falling

00:14:59.518 --> 00:15:02.719
Caption: pointing

00:15:01.039 --> 00:15:04.719
Caption: right

00:15:02.719 --> 00:15:06.159
Caption: the difference and in fact if if you&#39;re

00:15:04.719 --> 00:15:07.919
Caption: looking at this guy

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:09.838
Caption: i copied

00:15:07.919 --> 00:15:12.479
Caption: the guy that sort of like two to the

00:15:09.838 --> 00:15:16.638
Caption: left and added the legs thickened his

00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:16.638
Caption: arms and added the shading

00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:24.000
Caption: and then sort of the stick figure guy i

00:15:20.239 --> 00:15:24.000
Caption: like these from there i like how they

00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:30.479
Caption: look so again the whiteboard people

00:15:28.479 --> 00:15:32.719
Caption: these are very quick to draw using the

00:15:30.479 --> 00:15:34.958
Caption: the pen with the chiseled

00:15:32.719 --> 00:15:34.958
Caption: tip

00:15:36.159 --> 00:15:38.638
Caption: and once you get the hang of drawing

00:15:37.599 --> 00:15:41.919
Caption: people

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:43.119
Caption: then you can you know start to have them

00:15:41.919 --> 00:15:46.958
Caption: do things so

00:15:43.119 --> 00:15:47.760
Caption: a team being led on a journey in a boat

00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:51.440
Caption: very

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.440
Caption: quick easy to to draw

00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:56.559
Caption: is this kind of cool

00:15:57.838 --> 00:16:00.958
Caption: all right

00:15:59.119 --> 00:16:02.880
Caption: emotions

00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.078
Caption: so

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.958
Caption: happy you don&#39;t need to put eyes for

00:16:04.078 --> 00:16:08.320
Caption: happy

00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:09.278
Caption: smiley face is really all you need

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.799
Caption: shock

00:16:09.278 --> 00:16:12.320
Caption: pondering or thought

00:16:10.799 --> 00:16:14.000
Caption: scared

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.880
Caption: if you don&#39;t want to draw faces you can

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.039
Caption: use symbolism as well right very easy to

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.119
Caption: uh to just give an idea you can you can

00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:22.479
Caption: dress them up in hats

00:16:21.119 --> 00:16:23.599
Caption: here

00:16:22.479 --> 00:16:24.799
Caption: okay

00:16:23.599 --> 00:16:27.359
Caption: now

00:16:24.799 --> 00:16:29.039
Caption: if you have to

00:16:27.359 --> 00:16:30.719
Caption: i&#39;m going to say

00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:32.958
Caption: don&#39;t draw

00:16:30.719 --> 00:16:35.119
Caption: don&#39;t draw the stick man

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.398
Caption: it&#39;s just as easy to draw

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:37.919
Caption: two long legs

00:16:36.398 --> 00:16:39.838
Caption: and a pair of arms

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:42.078
Caption: and it just comes across as a lot better

00:16:39.838 --> 00:16:42.078
Caption: right

00:16:44.078 --> 00:16:46.320
Caption: so

00:16:45.039 --> 00:16:49.039
Caption: i&#39;ll save

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:52.559
Caption: i&#39;ll give this to you as a as a

00:16:49.039 --> 00:16:52.559
Caption: jpeg afterwards as well

00:16:54.719 --> 00:17:00.559
Caption: so writing is the next thing

00:16:57.838 --> 00:17:03.440
Caption: and this is a thing i hate

00:17:00.559 --> 00:17:06.078
Caption: so this is my writing

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.719
Caption: all right it&#39;s shocking

00:17:06.078 --> 00:17:10.558
Caption: i can barely read it

00:17:08.719 --> 00:17:12.400
Caption: and if i have to do something fast and

00:17:10.558 --> 00:17:14.958
Caption: if i&#39;m nervous like in a room of people

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:18.559
Caption: it gets even worse

00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:20.000
Caption: so this is the be cable style of writing

00:17:18.558 --> 00:17:23.038
Caption: okay and

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.880
Caption: the one thing is it&#39;s really compact

00:17:23.038 --> 00:17:28.078
Caption: right much much more compact than my

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.839
Caption: handwriting so you can fit it

00:17:28.078 --> 00:17:32.959
Caption: into flip charts really easily you can

00:17:29.839 --> 00:17:35.279
Caption: get a lot more letters in so it&#39;s good

00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:39.678
Caption: and the thing that makes it readable

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.679
Caption: is the really tall skinny

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.719
Caption: lowercase characters

00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:45.678
Caption: now

00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:50.159
Caption: sucks at this

00:17:48.479 --> 00:17:51.760
Caption: this is the only font you have in

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.640
Caption: concept it&#39;s

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.558
Caption: helvetica or ariel and it&#39;s really long

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.880
Caption: and you don&#39;t get a choice it&#39;s one they

00:17:56.558 --> 00:18:01.520
Caption: say fonts are coming later

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.319
Caption: next year but

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.080
Caption: so

00:18:02.319 --> 00:18:06.000
Caption: that means i have to hand write

00:18:04.079 --> 00:18:08.880
Caption: everything

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.400
Caption: so how do i do that when my writing

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.479
Caption: sucks

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.400
Caption: well

00:18:12.479 --> 00:18:16.079
Caption: i&#39;ve made my own font of all the letters

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.440
Caption: i use

00:18:16.079 --> 00:18:20.399
Caption: and then

00:18:17.439 --> 00:18:23.199
Caption: i copy paste

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.200
Caption: and manually

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:30.720
Caption: kern

00:18:26.319 --> 00:18:30.719
Caption: and this this kind of sucks right

00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:34.079
Caption: it kind of looks neat when you&#39;re

00:18:32.558 --> 00:18:36.079
Caption: watching it and my teammates when they

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:36.798
Caption: see me doing this like that kind of you

00:18:36.079 --> 00:18:39.199
Caption: know

00:18:36.798 --> 00:18:40.639
Caption: that sort of satisfying videos that you

00:18:39.199 --> 00:18:42.079
Caption: see where people are lining up the

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.239
Caption: letters and

00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:46.319
Caption: other things so that&#39;s how i do this it

00:18:44.239 --> 00:18:49.359
Caption: takes a long time

00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:51.038
Caption: so i have a shortcut

00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:53.038
Caption: and i have a

00:18:51.038 --> 00:18:53.839
Caption: i use lucidchart as well

00:18:53.038 --> 00:18:55.678
Caption: so

00:18:53.839 --> 00:18:57.119
Caption: i&#39;ve hand drawn a font that kinda

00:18:55.678 --> 00:18:58.399
Caption: matches with

00:18:57.119 --> 00:19:00.798
Caption: lucidchart

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.320
Caption: so i will sometimes use this instead of

00:19:00.798 --> 00:19:05.839
Caption: the vocabulary font

00:19:02.319 --> 00:19:05.839
Caption: and if i go to here

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:12.079
Caption: i didn&#39;t write that i went into

00:19:08.719 --> 00:19:14.000
Caption: lucidchart i typed it in i saved it as a

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:16.798
Caption: transparent jpeg

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.280
Caption: i airdropped it onto the ipad i imported

00:19:16.798 --> 00:19:20.959
Caption: it in and and dropped it into my diagram

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.080
Caption: and that&#39;s much faster than writing

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:24.399
Caption: paragraphs so if i have to write

00:19:22.079 --> 00:19:26.159
Caption: paragraphs and put it in mostly i don&#39;t

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.520
Caption: because mostly i&#39;m just drawing pictures

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.320
Caption: but if i have to that&#39;s the way i go

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.558
Caption: so

00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:33.759
Caption: i&#39;m really looking forward to concepts

00:19:32.558 --> 00:19:36.239
Caption: supporting

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:39.839
Caption: more fonts

00:19:36.239 --> 00:19:39.839
Caption: so actually going back to this

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:43.678
Caption: and the

00:19:42.319 --> 00:19:46.479
Caption: um

00:19:43.678 --> 00:19:46.479
Caption: it improves

00:19:47.599 --> 00:19:51.439
Caption: memory right

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:54.640
Caption: if i were to bring up

00:19:51.439 --> 00:19:54.639
Caption: the original flip chart

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.719
Caption: where was a helicopter

00:19:57.038 --> 00:20:01.038
Caption: hands up

00:19:58.719 --> 00:20:04.159
Caption: was it there number two

00:20:01.038 --> 00:20:08.159
Caption: no hands up when i go to the right one

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:10.400
Caption: it was five yeah all right

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.400
Caption: had i written down the helicopters as a

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.640
Caption: list you probably wouldn&#39;t remember it

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.640
Caption: right

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:23.359
Caption: faces i&#39;m almost done

00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:25.599
Caption: so

00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:29.719
Caption: ever want to draw this

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:29.719
Caption: step one draw the nose

00:20:35.839 --> 00:20:38.558
Caption: then a smile

00:20:45.439 --> 00:20:48.678
Caption: in here

00:20:52.959 --> 00:20:57.158
Caption: 66 for eyes

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.798
Caption: some spiky hair

00:21:08.479 --> 00:21:12.319
Caption: a chin

00:21:10.798 --> 00:21:14.000
Caption: a neck

00:21:12.319 --> 00:21:17.158
Caption: a collar

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.159
Caption: and shoulders

00:21:26.558 --> 00:21:31.839
Caption: let&#39;s start that again

00:21:28.959 --> 00:21:31.839
Caption: a nose

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.719
Caption: a mustache

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:38.319
Caption: the same ear

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.079
Caption: pair of glasses

00:21:44.079 --> 00:21:46.558
Caption: the chin

00:21:47.038 --> 00:21:49.678
Caption: make the neck

00:21:50.479 --> 00:21:53.719
Caption: bolt head

00:21:58.959 --> 00:22:01.199
Caption: right

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.678
Caption: and that&#39;s done

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:08.319
Caption: so

00:22:05.678 --> 00:22:11.439
Caption: i&#39;m kind of on time

00:22:08.319 --> 00:22:11.439
Caption: who thinks i can do that

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.200
Caption: a few more all right that&#39;s good

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.960
Caption: so

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.959
Caption: um my journey

00:22:23.038 --> 00:22:30.558
Caption: uh where are we

00:22:26.719 --> 00:22:32.798
Caption: if i go back to now um

00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:34.558
Caption: these are some diagrams that i&#39;ve

00:22:32.798 --> 00:22:37.038
Caption: started so

00:22:34.558 --> 00:22:39.199
Caption: before the cable this is just a picture

00:22:37.038 --> 00:22:41.519
Caption: from a whiteboard that

00:22:39.199 --> 00:22:43.439
Caption: i&#39;ve driven right drawn so

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.200
Caption: scribbling coloring in that sort of

00:22:43.439 --> 00:22:46.000
Caption: thing

00:22:45.199 --> 00:22:47.918
Caption: so

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.199
Caption: i tend to call this a light board where

00:22:47.918 --> 00:22:50.719
Caption: you&#39;re

00:22:49.199 --> 00:22:53.038
Caption: you&#39;re drawing with light on a black

00:22:50.719 --> 00:22:55.599
Caption: background

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:57.038
Caption: after the cavallo

00:22:55.599 --> 00:22:59.439
Caption: i switched to

00:22:57.038 --> 00:23:00.959
Caption: a white board so this was my first

00:22:59.439 --> 00:23:03.199
Caption: attempt

00:23:00.959 --> 00:23:06.079
Caption: and this was in a week of of using the

00:23:03.199 --> 00:23:08.880
Caption: cable i had redrawn

00:23:06.079 --> 00:23:12.798
Caption: using the cavallo technique of shading

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:15.359
Caption: and coloring and the shapes etc

00:23:12.798 --> 00:23:15.359
Caption: and then

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.479
Caption: this is kind of where i am now where i&#39;m

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:22.240
Caption: i&#39;m painstakingly neat

00:23:20.479 --> 00:23:24.719
Caption: because i use these over and over and

00:23:22.239 --> 00:23:25.599
Caption: over again it&#39;s like a it&#39;s like a book

00:23:24.719 --> 00:23:27.199
Caption: you know

00:23:25.599 --> 00:23:28.880
Caption: reading a story to a classroom where i&#39;m

00:23:27.199 --> 00:23:30.079
Caption: flipping pages so

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.239
Caption: um

00:23:30.079 --> 00:23:34.000
Caption: i&#39;ve put time into into something that

00:23:32.239 --> 00:23:36.158
Caption: i&#39;m going to use more than half a dozen

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.079
Caption: times or in this case a presentation i

00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:39.200
Caption: do once but

00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:41.038
Caption: anyway

00:23:39.199 --> 00:23:44.399
Caption: so this is the same version

00:23:41.038 --> 00:23:45.918
Caption: as a light board and visually i like the

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.520
Caption: the brightness of the imagery on black

00:23:45.918 --> 00:23:52.959
Caption: but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a personal choice

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.839
Caption: now two weeks ago i gave a i gave a talk

00:23:52.959 --> 00:23:56.399
Caption: on

00:23:53.839 --> 00:23:57.599
Caption: data mesh at a

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.520
Caption: um

00:23:57.599 --> 00:24:01.599
Caption: at an event in perth

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.520
Caption: and i&#39;m not without stepping through it

00:24:01.599 --> 00:24:05.439
Caption: like i stepped through this

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.799
Caption: this was

00:24:05.439 --> 00:24:08.239
Caption: this was the presentation it&#39;s the first

00:24:06.798 --> 00:24:10.639
Caption: time i sort of gave a presentation with

00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:11.520
Caption: a tablet and a pen in front of a big

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.119
Caption: room

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.400
Caption: but

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:18.479
Caption: i tend to have slides in meetings where

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.520
Caption: i do you know agenda

00:24:18.479 --> 00:24:21.439
Caption: um

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.080
Caption: uh go through problems where i might

00:24:21.439 --> 00:24:26.719
Caption: document it um

00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:28.798
Caption: uh so on and then you know the the

00:24:26.719 --> 00:24:31.918
Caption: imagery and i&#39;m just panning through

00:24:28.798 --> 00:24:33.599
Caption: this i will if there are things that are

00:24:31.918 --> 00:24:36.319
Caption: i need to bring in i&#39;ll bring them in as

00:24:33.599 --> 00:24:38.400
Caption: a screenshot and just sort of frame them

00:24:36.319 --> 00:24:40.558
Caption: in my

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.919
Caption: in my light boards you can see here my

00:24:40.558 --> 00:24:43.520
Caption: people

00:24:41.918 --> 00:24:45.439
Caption: okay

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.479
Caption: drawing interesting things like uh for

00:24:45.439 --> 00:24:48.239
Caption: example

00:24:46.479 --> 00:24:51.038
Caption: you know finding a balance between

00:24:48.239 --> 00:24:53.599
Caption: central and decentralized governance

00:24:51.038 --> 00:24:55.918
Caption: putting on a see-saw just

00:24:53.599 --> 00:24:57.678
Caption: coming up with ideas about how you want

00:24:55.918 --> 00:24:59.918
Caption: to portray something that you&#39;re you&#39;re

00:24:57.678 --> 00:25:03.359
Caption: talking about so this is this was a

00:24:59.918 --> 00:25:04.798
Caption: 20-minute talk and that was everything

00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:07.278
Caption: that i had talked about and i&#39;m going to

00:25:04.798 --> 00:25:09.918
Caption: switch to a different

00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:12.960
Caption: document now so this is going to go away

00:25:09.918 --> 00:25:12.959
Caption: and i&#39;m going to go in here

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:17.200
Caption: and this is this is my

00:25:15.359 --> 00:25:18.400
Caption: storytelling

00:25:17.199 --> 00:25:20.000
Caption: sort of

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.400
Caption: light board

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.359
Caption: so again i have my meeting hygiene

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:29.039
Caption: slides okay which i go through

00:25:25.359 --> 00:25:31.760
Caption: uh history of confluent and apache kafka

00:25:29.038 --> 00:25:33.759
Caption: and then i have my storytelling so all

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.760
Caption: this

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.760
Caption: i hand draw right

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.000
Caption: and i can bring them up and shut them

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.359
Caption: down depending on you know the story i

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.279
Caption: want to take there&#39;s about six stories

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:45.278
Caption: in this light board everything is turned

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:46.080
Caption: on

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:50.720
Caption: and

00:25:46.079 --> 00:25:50.719
Caption: that&#39;s it so that&#39;s my presentation

00:25:53.439 --> 00:25:55.839
Caption: questions

00:25:54.479 --> 00:25:59.199
Caption: how much time do we have because i think

00:25:55.839 --> 00:26:02.199
Caption: i&#39;m probably are we at time

00:25:59.199 --> 00:26:02.199
Caption: okay

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.678
Caption: um how do you get the ideas to generate

00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:21.599
Caption: these stories

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:24.640
Caption: um

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:26.000
Caption: some of them are from so it might be a

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.719
Caption: presentation

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.038
Caption: or it might be a youtube video that has

00:26:28.719 --> 00:26:32.959
Caption: a concept around let&#39;s just say it&#39;s you

00:26:31.038 --> 00:26:34.000
Caption: know in my role i might need to talk

00:26:32.959 --> 00:26:36.158
Caption: about

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.400
Caption: data warehouse modernization so i&#39;ll

00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:41.120
Caption: take ideas and i will typically start

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:43.520
Caption: with a flow so i will scribble out

00:26:41.119 --> 00:26:45.839
Caption: um in a layer within concepts just

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.959
Caption: wording or pictures as to what as to how

00:26:45.839 --> 00:26:48.880
Caption: i want to

00:26:46.959 --> 00:26:51.199
Caption: to make the story

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.599
Caption: and then i start from

00:26:51.199 --> 00:26:55.278
Caption: the first part to the last part drawing

00:26:53.599 --> 00:26:56.319
Caption: out the bits and pieces that i want to

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:57.760
Caption: talk about

00:26:56.319 --> 00:26:58.880
Caption: and then just sort of crossing them off

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.640
Caption: as i go

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.719
Caption: all right and then once so what i

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.239
Caption: haven&#39;t done is i within concepts and

00:27:02.719 --> 00:27:06.400
Caption: the way i&#39;ve worked this is

00:27:04.239 --> 00:27:09.038
Caption: i have all the different steps in my

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.960
Caption: story in different layers so what i was

00:27:09.038 --> 00:27:12.399
Caption: doing with the pen and in fact what i

00:27:10.959 --> 00:27:14.158
Caption: can show you

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.839
Caption: is

00:27:14.159 --> 00:27:17.760
Caption: in concepts i can

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:19.439
Caption: it has a presentation mode which is good

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.119
Caption: what i&#39;m going to go here is just to

00:27:19.439 --> 00:27:24.879
Caption: mirror everything

00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:28.400
Caption: and now you can see the toolbar so

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:31.119
Caption: over on the right in this one there are

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:34.320
Caption: layers and i can turn these on and off

00:27:31.119 --> 00:27:35.439
Caption: as i go so building out that story once

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:37.918
Caption: i do one

00:27:35.439 --> 00:27:41.119
Caption: new layer draw the new one new layer

00:27:37.918 --> 00:27:44.239
Caption: draw the new one and also with the

00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:46.400
Caption: with like if i&#39;m drawing out icons so

00:27:44.239 --> 00:27:49.359
Caption: here where i&#39;ve got shading that&#39;s

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:51.679
Caption: potentially three layers so the um the

00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:53.119
Caption: line around the outside the coloring on

00:27:51.678 --> 00:27:54.239
Caption: the inside and then if i want to put a

00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:55.918
Caption: shadow in there there&#39;s a layer

00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:58.918
Caption: underneath which i then combine to that

00:27:55.918 --> 00:27:58.918
Caption: object

00:28:03.038 --> 00:28:08.558
Caption: i i think you might have answered this

00:28:05.678 --> 00:28:11.678
Caption: but are these like reusable compounds

00:28:08.558 --> 00:28:15.038
Caption: yes yes so what i do is um over you can

00:28:11.678 --> 00:28:17.519
Caption: see my screen now on the left i have

00:28:15.038 --> 00:28:19.519
Caption: things that i&#39;ve imported into a toolbar

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.520
Caption: so i can

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.320
Caption: for example

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.520
Caption: if i

00:28:22.319 --> 00:28:25.759
Caption: do that right

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.520
Caption: drop them in and use them so

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.399
Caption: the things i use more i drop in so it

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:32.159
Caption: makes it much easier to do and then

00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:35.919
Caption: hence it becomes a lot faster than

00:28:32.159 --> 00:28:35.919
Caption: drawing it on a on a piece of paper

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:41.039
Caption: a funny thing is so in concepts

00:28:39.119 --> 00:28:43.279
Caption: a double tap is undo

00:28:41.038 --> 00:28:45.678
Caption: and a triple tap is redo

00:28:43.279 --> 00:28:47.919
Caption: and occasionally now if i&#39;m doing this

00:28:45.678 --> 00:28:49.678
Caption: and i stuff it up i&#39;ll do that

00:28:47.918 --> 00:28:51.759
Caption: and it&#39;s like you know it it just

00:28:49.678 --> 00:28:53.199
Caption: becomes natural once you start using

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.558
Caption: this all the time and you go into other

00:28:53.199 --> 00:28:58.038
Caption: apps and i double tap i know i&#39;ve got to

00:28:54.558 --> 00:28:58.038
Caption: hit the undo button

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:12.399
Caption: hello

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:15.359
Caption: are you able to pre-configure the views

00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:17.840
Caption: for the storytelling steps or are you

00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:20.079
Caption: constantly another no i&#39;m constantly

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:22.319
Caption: paging

00:29:20.079 --> 00:29:23.918
Caption: i have thought about drawing them up and

00:29:22.319 --> 00:29:25.119
Caption: then potentially using something like

00:29:23.918 --> 00:29:26.639
Caption: prezi

00:29:25.119 --> 00:29:28.880
Caption: but

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.558
Caption: when you&#39;re in a meeting it sometimes

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.798
Caption: you&#39;ll get taken off track

00:29:30.558 --> 00:29:33.678
Caption: and doing that in a prezi is is a bit

00:29:32.798 --> 00:29:34.558
Caption: hard

00:29:33.678 --> 00:29:36.079
Caption: so

00:29:34.558 --> 00:29:39.359
Caption: you just have to

00:29:36.079 --> 00:29:41.278
Caption: i mean i&#39;m kind of used to it and

00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:42.479
Caption: it makes it interactive and i always get

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:46.320
Caption: lots of feedback at the end of the

00:29:42.479 --> 00:29:46.319
Caption: meeting how did you do that right

00:29:51.199 --> 00:29:54.798
Caption: hey

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.039
Caption: do you have like any tips for showing

00:29:54.798 --> 00:29:59.519
Caption: how to do uh like

00:29:57.038 --> 00:30:01.038
Caption: like cleaning up like relations between

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.320
Caption: things like this talks this is the

00:30:01.038 --> 00:30:03.359
Caption: script of this

00:30:02.319 --> 00:30:05.918
Caption: um

00:30:03.359 --> 00:30:06.880
Caption: it kind of like how you do it on paper

00:30:05.918 --> 00:30:08.959
Caption: so

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.839
Caption: um if i were to

00:30:08.959 --> 00:30:13.918
Caption: to just draw something you know

00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:14.880
Caption: actually that&#39;s let me so within here

00:30:13.918 --> 00:30:16.158
Caption: you can see

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:21.319
Caption: you can change

00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:21.320
Caption: um how things work so

00:30:22.239 --> 00:30:24.959
Caption: you know

00:30:23.199 --> 00:30:27.199
Caption: doing it very quickly but you can see in

00:30:24.959 --> 00:30:29.839
Caption: this diagram how i&#39;ve got like lots of

00:30:27.199 --> 00:30:30.880
Caption: arrows and things that that&#39;s i

00:30:29.839 --> 00:30:33.678
Caption: i have the

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:37.839
Caption: boxes inside other boxes um you know

00:30:33.678 --> 00:30:37.839
Caption: connectors that you hand draw

00:30:37.918 --> 00:30:40.959
Caption: is there any sort of thing you&#39;d like to

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.919
Caption: sort of

00:30:40.959 --> 00:30:43.918
Caption: go beyond that or

00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:49.439
Caption: no it&#39;s um so one of the things i do is

00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:51.039
Caption: i&#39;ll draw something and i think well

00:30:49.439 --> 00:30:54.000
Caption: that doesn&#39;t fit

00:30:51.038 --> 00:30:55.199
Caption: so then what i need to do is you know

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.880
Caption: i&#39;ll be

00:30:55.199 --> 00:30:59.678
Caption: selecting

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.678
Caption: large areas

00:31:00.399 --> 00:31:03.360
Caption: and then i have to wait for that because

00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:05.439
Caption: that&#39;s quite complex

00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:06.719
Caption: and then i&#39;ll move them around

00:31:05.439 --> 00:31:09.278
Caption: right so

00:31:06.719 --> 00:31:10.798
Caption: quite often when i&#39;m doing the drawings

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:12.399
Caption: it doesn&#39;t work the way i want it and

00:31:10.798 --> 00:31:15.398
Caption: then i have to start reorganizing the

00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:15.399
Caption: puzzle

00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:23.440
Caption: you heard of the tool mirror yes

00:31:21.359 --> 00:31:24.239
Caption: i&#39;m sorry yeah so mirror is very good

00:31:23.439 --> 00:31:25.599
Caption: for

00:31:24.239 --> 00:31:28.399
Caption: those online where you&#39;ve got lots of

00:31:25.599 --> 00:31:29.839
Caption: people working um at the same time but

00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:31.760
Caption: most of those people are working with a

00:31:29.839 --> 00:31:33.599
Caption: mouse right you&#39;re putting a post-it

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:37.119
Caption: note on a piece of paper and you&#39;re

00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:39.119
Caption: drawing drawing with a mouse is so hard

00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:43.439
Caption: yeah yeah

00:31:39.119 --> 00:31:43.439
Caption: but mirror&#39;s cool it is right for

00:31:44.079 --> 00:31:47.398
Caption: yeah yeah

00:31:47.439 --> 00:31:53.439
Caption: so how do you share your slides after

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:55.279
Caption: presentations um so after i&#39;ve um i&#39;ve

00:31:53.439 --> 00:31:56.719
Caption: done something and typically what i&#39;ll

00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:58.480
Caption: do is i&#39;ll have a layer in here which is

00:31:56.719 --> 00:32:00.558
Caption: where i put my notes so actions and

00:31:58.479 --> 00:32:03.439
Caption: everything else

Caption: whether it&#39;s a selection or the entire

00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:12.559
Caption: drawing whether i want

01:05:56.959 --> 01:06:00.318
Caption: how fast is your website really that&#39;s a

01:05:58.479 --> 01:06:04.000
Caption: question i&#39;m gonna ask today how many

01:06:00.319 --> 01:06:06.000
Caption: people build fast websites

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.358
Caption: you all build slow websites

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.199
Caption: that&#39;s probably why you&#39;re here i guess

01:06:07.358 --> 01:06:10.639
Caption: right

01:06:09.199 --> 01:06:12.159
Caption: cool um

01:06:10.639 --> 01:06:14.159
Caption: how do you know if your website&#39;s fast

01:06:12.159 --> 01:06:15.598
Caption: though i kind of was bill built this

01:06:14.159 --> 01:06:18.159
Caption: slide under the assumption that everyone

01:06:15.599 --> 01:06:20.079
Caption: will put their hands up but that&#39;s okay

01:06:18.159 --> 01:06:21.439
Caption: how do we even know that&#39;s probably the

01:06:20.079 --> 01:06:22.720
Caption: question that we need to ask at the

01:06:21.439 --> 01:06:25.039
Caption: moment

01:06:22.719 --> 01:06:28.000
Caption: so spoiler alert this is how you know

01:06:25.039 --> 01:06:30.000
Caption: this is this is the answer you need to

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.599
Caption: have user-centric performance metrics

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.839
Caption: you need to capture those metrics from

01:06:31.599 --> 01:06:35.599
Caption: real devices and you need to have

01:06:33.839 --> 01:06:38.000
Caption: continuous observability over those

01:06:35.599 --> 01:06:39.520
Caption: metrics so that&#39;s that&#39;s the whole talk

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.959
Caption: right um

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.319
Caption: no that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s the end of

01:06:40.959 --> 01:06:43.439
Caption: the talk i&#39;m going to get to that point

01:06:42.319 --> 01:06:45.440
Caption: but we&#39;re going to figure out how to get

01:06:43.439 --> 01:06:47.919
Caption: there right

01:06:45.439 --> 01:06:49.679
Caption: um just before i continue on one thing

01:06:47.919 --> 01:06:51.520
Caption: that this talk is not going to be is how

01:06:49.679 --> 01:06:53.838
Caption: to actually tune for better for

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:55.520
Caption: performance um how to do web performance

01:06:53.839 --> 01:06:57.200
Caption: tuning um that&#39;s probably a whole other

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:58.799
Caption: talk in itself

01:06:57.199 --> 01:07:00.558
Caption: and actually there&#39;s tons of tips like

01:06:58.799 --> 01:07:02.479
Caption: google will give you heaps of tips on

01:07:00.559 --> 01:07:03.920
Caption: how to do that so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll separate

01:07:02.479 --> 01:07:05.039
Caption: that out of this talk

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:06.959
Caption: we&#39;re just going to figure out how to

01:07:05.039 --> 01:07:10.160
Caption: actually measure it first

01:07:06.959 --> 01:07:10.159
Caption: and then we&#39;ll go from there

01:07:10.319 --> 01:07:14.239
Caption: so let&#39;s start by forgetting everything

01:07:12.479 --> 01:07:16.559
Caption: we actually know about web performance

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:18.399
Caption: monitoring and we&#39;ll start from scratch

01:07:16.559 --> 01:07:20.719
Caption: i like the idea of starting somewhere

01:07:18.399 --> 01:07:22.719
Caption: really naive and then kind of building

01:07:20.719 --> 01:07:24.719
Caption: up building up from there so what we&#39;re

01:07:22.719 --> 01:07:27.199
Caption: going to do is do the simplest thing

01:07:24.719 --> 01:07:29.520
Caption: that i can probably think of which is

01:07:27.199 --> 01:07:31.039
Caption: just on on that page load event um this

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.039
Caption: is an event that&#39;s available to you in

01:07:31.039 --> 01:07:34.880
Caption: the browser um we&#39;re just going to track

01:07:33.039 --> 01:07:36.640
Caption: our performance there so this would be

01:07:34.879 --> 01:07:39.358
Caption: code that you can actually run

01:07:36.639 --> 01:07:41.199
Caption: and we can see our page took 729

01:07:39.358 --> 01:07:42.479
Caption: milliseconds to load

01:07:41.199 --> 01:07:44.159
Caption: so that&#39;s nice

01:07:42.479 --> 01:07:45.598
Caption: except it kind of falls apart because

01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:47.280
Caption: the moment we look in the performance

01:07:45.599 --> 01:07:50.079
Caption: inspector which is the tool that&#39;s

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.760
Caption: available inside chrome you can see the

01:07:50.079 --> 01:07:52.880
Caption: the red l there that&#39;s your page load

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.559
Caption: event and you can actually see that

01:07:52.879 --> 01:07:55.919
Caption: stuff&#39;s happening on either side of that

01:07:54.559 --> 01:07:58.079
Caption: event and actually most of it&#39;s

01:07:55.919 --> 01:08:00.000
Caption: happening on the wrong side so that&#39;s

01:07:58.079 --> 01:08:01.680
Caption: not telling us anything useful

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.760
Caption: basically more of the stuff is happening

01:08:01.679 --> 01:08:07.439
Caption: after that event

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:07.439
Caption: so we&#39;ve got to try and fix that

01:08:08.079 --> 01:08:12.960
Caption: one thing we could do is we could use

01:08:09.679 --> 01:08:14.159
Caption: the new navigation timing api so it&#39;s a

01:08:12.959 --> 01:08:15.838
Caption: bit more modern than just sort of

01:08:14.159 --> 01:08:16.718
Caption: running a page load event

01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:19.120
Caption: um

01:08:16.719 --> 01:08:21.120
Caption: that is okay but really that&#39;s just

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.719
Caption: giving us a whole lot of numbers that

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.239
Caption: are about as meaningless as the page

01:08:22.719 --> 01:08:26.400
Caption: load event that&#39;s not telling us

01:08:24.238 --> 01:08:29.599
Caption: anything useful when i get

01:08:26.399 --> 01:08:31.120
Caption: uh dom content loaded event end

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:34.959
Caption: what does that mean what does that mean

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.959
Caption: for the user what does that look like

01:08:36.238 --> 01:08:41.198
Caption: so a bunch of smart big brain people

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:42.560
Caption: have gotten together and actually uh

01:08:41.199 --> 01:08:43.520
Caption: all realized that we all have the same

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.759
Caption: problem

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:47.758
Caption: and they put together the w3c web

01:08:45.758 --> 01:08:49.198
Caption: performance working group

01:08:47.758 --> 01:08:50.798
Caption: and this group

01:08:49.199 --> 01:08:53.040
Caption: came together and came up with a they

01:08:50.798 --> 01:08:55.278
Caption: coined a term called user-centric

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.399
Caption: performance or user-centric performance

01:08:55.278 --> 01:08:58.158
Caption: metrics

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:59.520
Caption: so what are those

01:08:58.159 --> 01:09:01.600
Caption: they&#39;re centered around a couple of

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:03.838
Caption: different things

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.560
Caption: you&#39;ve got perceived load speed that&#39;s

01:09:03.838 --> 01:09:08.479
Caption: as perceived as in as best as we can

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.159
Caption: represent the load speed perceived by

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:12.560
Caption: the user

01:09:10.159 --> 01:09:15.839
Caption: load responsiveness uh which is just how

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:17.679
Caption: fast that that process goes for

01:09:15.838 --> 01:09:20.399
Caption: runtime responsiveness which is after

01:09:17.679 --> 01:09:21.600
Caption: it&#39;s loaded how fast is your website

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:23.919
Caption: and then two other things visual

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.120
Caption: stability and smoothness which are less

01:09:23.919 --> 01:09:27.439
Caption: about performance but still really

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.640
Caption: important

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:33.278
Caption: and out of that who&#39;s seen these before

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.919
Caption: these metrics yep web vitals

01:09:33.278 --> 01:09:38.238
Caption: a number of metrics with abbreviations

01:09:35.919 --> 01:09:40.158
Caption: that are sometimes hard to remember um

01:09:38.238 --> 01:09:42.879
Caption: that are the key metrics for measuring

01:09:40.159 --> 01:09:43.920
Caption: web performance really handy

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:45.919
Caption: i&#39;m going to go through all of these

01:09:43.919 --> 01:09:47.198
Caption: really quickly i i know a lot of you

01:09:45.919 --> 01:09:48.798
Caption: people put your hands up saying that

01:09:47.199 --> 01:09:50.400
Caption: they&#39;ve seen these before

01:09:48.798 --> 01:09:51.758
Caption: so i won&#39;t spend too long on them but

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:53.838
Caption: we&#39;re going to go through what each one

01:09:51.758 --> 01:09:55.839
Caption: of these means just quickly so time to

01:09:53.838 --> 01:09:57.198
Caption: first byte is the time between when the

01:09:55.839 --> 01:09:58.799
Caption: browser requests the page and when it

01:09:57.199 --> 01:10:01.120
Caption: receives the first bite of information

01:09:58.799 --> 01:10:03.759
Caption: back and it&#39;s kind of just all of the

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:05.280
Caption: stuff that&#39;s happening before your page

01:10:03.759 --> 01:10:06.479
Caption: loads

01:10:05.279 --> 01:10:07.599
Caption: there&#39;s actually quite a lot of it

01:10:06.479 --> 01:10:09.279
Caption: usually

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:11.919
Caption: a lot of this happens very very quickly

01:10:09.279 --> 01:10:13.919
Caption: so it&#39;s almost imperceptible but a

01:10:11.919 --> 01:10:16.640
Caption: number of things can actually affect how

01:10:13.919 --> 01:10:19.600
Caption: long this process takes so it&#39;s really

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.600
Caption: important to measure that

01:10:20.159 --> 01:10:22.560
Caption: google

01:10:21.199 --> 01:10:24.479
Caption: who

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:27.040
Caption: i guess are big and heavily involved in

01:10:24.479 --> 01:10:27.919
Caption: the w3c working web performance working

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.679
Caption: group

01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:32.000
Caption: suggests that time to first bite should

01:10:29.679 --> 01:10:34.800
Caption: be under 800 milliseconds that&#39;s a good

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.839
Caption: score but anything over 1.8 seconds is

01:10:34.799 --> 01:10:40.639
Caption: poor and needs improvement

01:10:37.839 --> 01:10:42.639
Caption: next up we have first contentful paint

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:44.800
Caption: this is the time from when the page

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.399
Caption: starts loading to any any part of the

01:10:44.799 --> 01:10:48.639
Caption: page is rendered on the screen so this

01:10:46.399 --> 01:10:50.640
Caption: is going from a white box in your

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:53.520
Caption: browser to the first time anything

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:53.520
Caption: appears on the screen

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:58.000
Caption: it looks a bit like this

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.600
Caption: so we can see we captured fcp when that

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.439
Caption: first part of the result comes up on the

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.800
Caption: top um google is really convenient for

01:11:01.439 --> 01:11:04.959
Caption: testing this stuff because they stream

01:11:02.799 --> 01:11:06.158
Caption: these results back to you so you slow it

01:11:04.959 --> 01:11:07.359
Caption: down slightly and you can actually

01:11:06.159 --> 01:11:09.920
Caption: capture this

01:11:07.359 --> 01:11:12.560
Caption: now we can see at the top there fcps 0.5

01:11:09.919 --> 01:11:15.040
Caption: seconds

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.800
Caption: fcp should be anywhere between

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.600
Caption: should be below 1.8 seconds if you can

01:11:16.799 --> 01:11:22.319
Caption: help it anything above 3 seconds is too

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.320
Caption: long and it needs improvement

01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:25.759
Caption: next up you have lcp or largest content

01:11:24.319 --> 01:11:27.439
Caption: for paint

01:11:25.759 --> 01:11:29.279
Caption: this is tracking how many seconds it

01:11:27.439 --> 01:11:31.279
Caption: takes for the largest

01:11:29.279 --> 01:11:34.000
Caption: item or the largest

01:11:31.279 --> 01:11:35.919
Caption: data most most data intensive

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.238
Caption: element above the fault element takes to

01:11:35.919 --> 01:11:38.238
Caption: load

01:11:38.479 --> 01:11:43.040
Caption: so it looks like this we can actually

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:46.399
Caption: see it shifts as this page loads um

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:48.080
Caption: and we&#39;re looking at the the largest

01:11:46.399 --> 01:11:50.158
Caption: uh we&#39;re tracking

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:52.839
Caption: oops we&#39;re tracking the largest uh

01:11:50.159 --> 01:11:56.400
Caption: element on the page at a given

01:11:52.839 --> 01:11:58.000
Caption: time let&#39;s pick that up

01:11:56.399 --> 01:12:00.238
Caption: so you can see

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.199
Caption: uh lcp shifts from from the sort of the

01:12:00.238 --> 01:12:03.039
Caption: top of the bottom of the page is

01:12:01.199 --> 01:12:04.320
Caption: actually um the fcp at the very

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.319
Caption: beginning

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:08.158
Caption: but then as the largest as we kind of

01:12:06.319 --> 01:12:10.079
Caption: uncover the largest element as we go

01:12:08.159 --> 01:12:13.520
Caption: that fcp score changes and at the end we

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.520
Caption: calculate it at 1.6 seconds

01:12:13.759 --> 01:12:17.359
Caption: largest content for paint should be

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:22.040
Caption: under 2.5 seconds if you can help it

01:12:17.359 --> 01:12:22.040
Caption: and anything over 4 seconds is too long

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.880
Caption: then you have some other metrics as well

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:28.639
Caption: less associated with load times but

01:12:26.879 --> 01:12:30.560
Caption: still really important um this one&#39;s

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.239
Caption: called first input delay it&#39;s the time

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.319
Caption: for the first interaction on the page um

01:12:32.238 --> 01:12:36.238
Caption: the first time your user clicks anything

01:12:34.319 --> 01:12:38.479
Caption: google targeted the first time the user

01:12:36.238 --> 01:12:39.919
Caption: clicks anything because uh quite often

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:42.640
Caption: while your page is loading it&#39;s quite a

01:12:39.919 --> 01:12:44.799
Caption: data intensive cpu intensive exercise

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.800
Caption: and if your user clicks anything while

01:12:44.799 --> 01:12:48.879
Caption: that&#39;s happening you are likely to see

01:12:46.799 --> 01:12:52.158
Caption: some sort of delay or incur some sort of

01:12:48.879 --> 01:12:55.198
Caption: sort of uh less than ideal experience

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:56.880
Caption: so they focused on that first input

01:12:55.199 --> 01:12:58.719
Caption: it looks a little bit like this

01:12:56.879 --> 01:13:00.799
Caption: usually it&#39;s quite imperceptible that

01:12:58.719 --> 01:13:03.199
Caption: the target scores are very low so this

01:13:00.799 --> 01:13:04.479
Caption: is a bit more of a contrived example

01:13:03.199 --> 01:13:06.239
Caption: but you can click that button and then

01:13:04.479 --> 01:13:08.640
Caption: there&#39;s an input delay there and we

01:13:06.238 --> 01:13:08.639
Caption: track that

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.959
Caption: like i was saying

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:14.319
Caption: quite quite low target scores there

01:13:12.959 --> 01:13:17.279
Caption: usually imperceptible like 100

01:13:14.319 --> 01:13:19.198
Caption: milliseconds is quite imperceptible

01:13:17.279 --> 01:13:22.399
Caption: a good score is 100 milliseconds

01:13:19.199 --> 01:13:23.920
Caption: anything over 300 is too long

01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:25.439
Caption: next up this is a fairly new metric

01:13:23.919 --> 01:13:27.120
Caption: called interaction to next paint and the

01:13:25.439 --> 01:13:28.479
Caption: way to think about this one is its first

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.560
Caption: input delay

01:13:28.479 --> 01:13:31.919
Caption: calculated slightly differently but over

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.679
Caption: the course of the entire interaction

01:13:31.919 --> 01:13:35.520
Caption: with the page so not just the first

01:13:33.679 --> 01:13:37.520
Caption: interaction but every interaction on the

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:39.919
Caption: page every button you click

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:42.080
Caption: every carousel you scroll and stuff like

01:13:39.919 --> 01:13:42.080
Caption: that

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.679
Caption: interaction to next paint should be

01:13:44.159 --> 01:13:47.360
Caption: under 200 milliseconds if you can help

01:13:45.679 --> 01:13:48.719
Caption: it um

01:13:47.359 --> 01:13:50.479
Caption: anything over

01:13:48.719 --> 01:13:52.400
Caption: every anything over half a second is too

01:13:50.479 --> 01:13:54.080
Caption: long

01:13:52.399 --> 01:13:55.839
Caption: now there&#39;s a slide missing there but

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.719
Caption: that&#39;s all right uh cumulative layout

01:13:55.839 --> 01:14:00.080
Caption: shift is the last one uh this one is a

01:13:58.719 --> 01:14:01.040
Caption: little bit a little bit different but i

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.399
Caption: think it&#39;s still a really important

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:05.040
Caption: metric it&#39;s not so much about web

01:14:02.399 --> 01:14:07.439
Caption: performance uh as as much it is as much

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.280
Caption: it is about sort of visual stability

01:14:07.439 --> 01:14:10.959
Caption: um the way

01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:13.279
Caption: we can perceive

01:14:10.959 --> 01:14:14.000
Caption: cumulative layout shift um this is why i

01:14:13.279 --> 01:14:16.079
Caption: think it&#39;s really important because

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.799
Caption: these are really annoying and they suck

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:21.600
Caption: and no user likes this when this happens

01:14:18.799 --> 01:14:23.279
Caption: um this is maybe a less disastrous

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.640
Caption: example but

01:14:23.279 --> 01:14:28.158
Caption: no missing a slide there too cool

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.239
Caption: there was a i think there was a famous

01:14:28.159 --> 01:14:31.600
Caption: example where um there was a layout

01:14:30.238 --> 01:14:34.158
Caption: shift on a

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.600
Caption: on a page with a nuclear missile alert

01:14:34.159 --> 01:14:37.360
Caption: test system and they clicked the wrong

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.600
Caption: one that&#39;s that&#39;s the picture i had but

01:14:37.359 --> 01:14:41.279
Caption: it&#39;s gone so

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.959
Caption: um this is a score between zero and one

01:14:41.279 --> 01:14:44.238
Caption: so it&#39;s sort of a calculated score i

01:14:42.959 --> 01:14:45.600
Caption: think of it more of like a percentage

01:14:44.238 --> 01:14:47.359
Caption: but i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s actually what

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.600
Caption: it&#39;s meant to represent but anything

01:14:47.359 --> 01:14:50.718
Caption: below 0.1 or 10

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.399
Caption: is good

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:55.760
Caption: uh anything over 25 or 0.25

01:14:54.399 --> 01:14:57.120
Caption: probably needs some work it&#39;s probably

01:14:55.759 --> 01:14:58.799
Caption: got too many of those shifting

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:01.600
Caption: components that are getting in the way

01:14:58.799 --> 01:15:01.599
Caption: annoying your users

01:15:02.159 --> 01:15:04.719
Caption: so

01:15:03.359 --> 01:15:07.359
Caption: a number of these metrics not all of

01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:08.880
Caption: them make up what google called the core

01:15:07.359 --> 01:15:10.959
Caption: web vitals

01:15:08.879 --> 01:15:12.479
Caption: you can see here largest contentful

01:15:10.959 --> 01:15:14.399
Caption: paint and first input delay and

01:15:12.479 --> 01:15:17.199
Caption: cumulative layout shift

01:15:14.399 --> 01:15:19.839
Caption: they make up actually what google

01:15:17.199 --> 01:15:23.280
Caption: uh uses to decide whether where your

01:15:19.839 --> 01:15:25.359
Caption: search engine ranking is um if you have

01:15:23.279 --> 01:15:26.559
Caption: uh if you&#39;re somewhere on a search

01:15:25.359 --> 01:15:28.238
Caption: engine page

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.439
Caption: typically you can move up that search

01:15:28.238 --> 01:15:32.238
Caption: engine page

01:15:29.439 --> 01:15:34.080
Caption: and result if you have a faster website

01:15:32.238 --> 01:15:36.158
Caption: so there&#39;s actually material benefit

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.560
Caption: here a commercial benefit

01:15:36.159 --> 01:15:40.080
Caption: in that if you improve the performance

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:42.000
Caption: of your site you actually

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:45.280
Caption: uh get get improved performance sort of

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.399
Caption: in in your externalities for example

01:15:45.279 --> 01:15:48.238
Caption: um i want to talk about largest

01:15:46.399 --> 01:15:50.319
Caption: contentful paint why do they choose that

01:15:48.238 --> 01:15:52.079
Caption: one

01:15:50.319 --> 01:15:54.079
Caption: because these metrics aren&#39;t they don&#39;t

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:55.199
Caption: have atomicity so

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.040
Caption: you might have noticed when we went

01:15:55.199 --> 01:15:59.280
Caption: through our examples before

01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:01.439
Caption: um time to first by time to first bite

01:15:59.279 --> 01:16:03.439
Caption: the way it&#39;s calculated usually means um

01:16:01.439 --> 01:16:05.120
Caption: you&#39;ll get a score that is below first

01:16:03.439 --> 01:16:06.879
Caption: contentful pain and a score that is

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:08.479
Caption: below your largest contentful pain

01:16:06.879 --> 01:16:09.759
Caption: sometimes the first contentful and

01:16:08.479 --> 01:16:12.238
Caption: largest contentful paint will be the

01:16:09.759 --> 01:16:14.319
Caption: same that&#39;s probably a good thing

01:16:12.238 --> 01:16:17.359
Caption: but what this means is tracking all of

01:16:14.319 --> 01:16:17.359
Caption: these three together

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:20.718
Caption: we can actually sort of look at the

01:16:18.879 --> 01:16:22.879
Caption: differences between them and identify

01:16:20.719 --> 01:16:25.199
Caption: which one is having the most impact on

01:16:22.879 --> 01:16:27.839
Caption: your web performance so for example if

01:16:25.199 --> 01:16:29.120
Caption: you have a high very high number for

01:16:27.839 --> 01:16:31.119
Caption: time to first bite that&#39;s usually an

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:32.800
Caption: indicator that

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.800
Caption: your user&#39;s very far away from where

01:16:32.799 --> 01:16:36.559
Caption: your web page is being served from you

01:16:34.799 --> 01:16:38.559
Caption: can improve that by bringing them closer

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:40.319
Caption: together

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.080
Caption: whereas if for example if your time to

01:16:40.319 --> 01:16:44.319
Caption: first bite is really good

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:45.760
Caption: but you&#39;ve got a kind of larger gap to

01:16:44.319 --> 01:16:47.678
Caption: first content footprint sort of in this

01:16:45.759 --> 01:16:49.759
Caption: case here and then a very large gap to

01:16:47.679 --> 01:16:52.560
Caption: the largest contentful paint um we&#39;re

01:16:49.759 --> 01:16:55.119
Caption: able to transfer the javascript and the

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:57.120
Caption: html onto the page very very quickly but

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:59.040
Caption: it takes a long time to process that

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:00.479
Caption: pass the javascript and render it so

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:03.560
Caption: that&#39;s where you&#39;d probably want to set

01:17:00.479 --> 01:17:03.560
Caption: your focus

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:07.120
Caption: and setting your focus on stuff like

01:17:05.839 --> 01:17:09.198
Caption: this

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:11.199
Caption: is really good like we have case studies

01:17:09.199 --> 01:17:13.520
Caption: that actually prove that there is

01:17:11.199 --> 01:17:15.280
Caption: commercial benefit to doing this

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.040
Caption: vodafone is a really good example

01:17:15.279 --> 01:17:20.238
Caption: vodafone&#39;s huge so eight percent of

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:21.679
Caption: sales is an astronomically high number

01:17:20.238 --> 01:17:23.599
Caption: but eight percent more sales when they

01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:26.400
Caption: increase their performance on largest

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.399
Caption: contentful pain

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:31.040
Caption: so i think we know how to get

01:17:29.359 --> 01:17:32.799
Caption: user-centric performance metrics now we

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:35.120
Caption: know what they are at least

01:17:32.799 --> 01:17:36.639
Caption: so we can tick that box

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:39.679
Caption: let&#39;s figure out now how to actually

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:41.120
Caption: capture these metrics

01:17:39.679 --> 01:17:42.719
Caption: so there&#39;s a couple of different ways

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:44.719
Caption: that we can capture them

01:17:42.719 --> 01:17:47.280
Caption: you&#39;ve got ad hoc testing synthetic

01:17:44.719 --> 01:17:48.640
Caption: monitoring and then real user monitoring

01:17:47.279 --> 01:17:50.639
Caption: so i&#39;m going to go into each one of

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:52.880
Caption: those

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:54.959
Caption: ad hoc testing who&#39;s used lighthouse for

01:17:52.879 --> 01:17:57.678
Caption: google chrome before

01:17:54.959 --> 01:18:00.718
Caption: nice this side of the room

01:17:57.679 --> 01:18:02.959
Caption: i&#39;ll focus my attention this way then

01:18:00.719 --> 01:18:06.000
Caption: so lighthouse for google chrome is a

01:18:02.959 --> 01:18:08.799
Caption: tool built in built into google chrome

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.319
Caption: that allows you to test any web page

01:18:08.799 --> 01:18:12.079
Caption: probably more likely your own the one

01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:14.238
Caption: that you manage

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:16.399
Caption: and it will give you back those those

01:18:14.238 --> 01:18:17.839
Caption: web vital scores you can see them it&#39;s

01:18:16.399 --> 01:18:20.879
Caption: probably kind of small but they&#39;re those

01:18:17.839 --> 01:18:23.119
Caption: numbers in the bottom right corner

01:18:20.879 --> 01:18:24.959
Caption: um it&#39;s tracked uh first contentful

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.719
Caption: paint largest can contentful paint all

01:18:24.959 --> 01:18:29.279
Caption: of those other metrics

01:18:26.719 --> 01:18:31.600
Caption: um this is really handy um it&#39;s

01:18:29.279 --> 01:18:33.198
Caption: obviously a free tool um

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:35.120
Caption: that you obviously a free tool that you

01:18:33.199 --> 01:18:37.120
Caption: can like everyone already has so really

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:40.000
Caption: good start using that um but perhaps a

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:42.640
Caption: better example is this tool here also

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.719
Caption: provided by google this will run

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.880
Caption: a lighthouse on your behalf

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:49.360
Caption: on a device

01:18:46.879 --> 01:18:51.600
Caption: that is not a desktop computer

01:18:49.359 --> 01:18:53.439
Caption: so this makes a huge difference because

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:56.320
Caption: the performance profile of a mobile

01:18:53.439 --> 01:18:58.479
Caption: device which is what this will run on um

01:18:56.319 --> 01:19:00.158
Caption: it makes a significant difference

01:18:58.479 --> 01:19:02.640
Caption: to the score and is actually probably

01:19:00.159 --> 01:19:04.479
Caption: more realistic and uh representative of

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.320
Caption: real world traffic most of your users

01:19:04.479 --> 01:19:07.600
Caption: are going to come from mobile devices

01:19:06.319 --> 01:19:10.238
Caption: the other interesting thing about this

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.159
Caption: is um this will run in a data center in

01:19:10.238 --> 01:19:14.799
Caption: the united states so if the majority of

01:19:12.159 --> 01:19:16.239
Caption: your customers are there and not here

01:19:14.799 --> 01:19:18.799
Caption: this is going to be more representative

01:19:16.238 --> 01:19:18.799
Caption: of that too

01:19:19.199 --> 01:19:23.840
Caption: so this ad hoc testing this is really

01:19:21.359 --> 01:19:26.158
Caption: great it&#39;s free anyone can do this and i

01:19:23.839 --> 01:19:27.119
Caption: suggest and recommend that people do

01:19:26.159 --> 01:19:28.479
Caption: this

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.840
Caption: when you&#39;ve got if you&#39;ve got a website

01:19:28.479 --> 01:19:31.120
Caption: you should be kind of testing the

01:19:29.839 --> 01:19:33.599
Caption: performance and tracking all of this

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:35.280
Caption: stuff there&#39;s no setup required everyone

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:37.520
Caption: has google chrome even if you don&#39;t use

01:19:35.279 --> 01:19:40.238
Caption: it you probably got it

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:42.159
Caption: but these are only good for once off

01:19:40.238 --> 01:19:43.359
Caption: manual tests it&#39;s it&#39;s clicking around

01:19:42.159 --> 01:19:44.640
Caption: testing stuff we don&#39;t have any

01:19:43.359 --> 01:19:46.319
Caption: automation here

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:47.280
Caption: um and they&#39;re also

01:19:46.319 --> 01:19:49.759
Caption: even though

01:19:47.279 --> 01:19:53.198
Caption: uh the the web performance uh the the

01:19:49.759 --> 01:19:55.119
Caption: web.dev slash measure that tool

01:19:53.199 --> 01:19:56.960
Caption: runs in a us data center on a mobile

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.640
Caption: device they still don&#39;t really represent

01:19:56.959 --> 01:20:01.359
Caption: real world traffic

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:03.199
Caption: i&#39;ll get back to that in a minute

01:20:01.359 --> 01:20:04.879
Caption: one of our other options is synthetic

01:20:03.199 --> 01:20:06.159
Caption: monitoring so this is an example of one

01:20:04.879 --> 01:20:07.359
Caption: tool

01:20:06.159 --> 01:20:09.199
Caption: these are really cool people that build

01:20:07.359 --> 01:20:10.799
Caption: this they&#39;re based in australia

01:20:09.199 --> 01:20:13.120
Caption: caliber and what we&#39;re actually looking

01:20:10.799 --> 01:20:14.399
Caption: at here is a pull request a comment on a

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:16.640
Caption: pull request

01:20:14.399 --> 01:20:19.359
Caption: so the way this tool is set up is every

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.880
Caption: time you create a pull request

01:20:19.359 --> 01:20:22.000
Caption: you can set it up to

01:20:20.879 --> 01:20:24.639
Caption: uh

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.439
Caption: on a deployed version of of this change

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:29.439
Caption: uh run run a web web vitals test i think

01:20:27.439 --> 01:20:31.600
Caption: it runs it just runs lighthouse but on

01:20:29.439 --> 01:20:33.040
Caption: your behalf it will run on multiple

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.919
Caption: different devices so it will run on

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:38.159
Caption: desktops but multiple different um

01:20:35.919 --> 01:20:40.000
Caption: android and ios devices for you as well

01:20:38.159 --> 01:20:41.520
Caption: we check that and it can you can choose

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.120
Caption: all the locations and stuff like that

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:45.199
Caption: that you run on so it&#39;s a bit more

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.840
Caption: representative of your railroad traffic

01:20:45.199 --> 01:20:47.840
Caption: again

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.799
Caption: so this is this is probably a better

01:20:49.279 --> 01:20:52.079
Caption: tool um

01:20:50.799 --> 01:20:52.959
Caption: if you want to sort of take the next

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.959
Caption: step

01:20:52.959 --> 01:20:56.959
Caption: you&#39;ve got your continuous integration

01:20:54.959 --> 01:20:59.359
Caption: continuous delivery automation through

01:20:56.959 --> 01:21:01.520
Caption: those pull request checks

01:20:59.359 --> 01:21:03.439
Caption: so that allows you if you&#39;re doing the

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:04.799
Caption: regular pull request to monitor change

01:21:03.439 --> 01:21:06.238
Caption: over time

01:21:04.799 --> 01:21:08.319
Caption: unfortunately this tool is not free you

01:21:06.238 --> 01:21:10.959
Caption: do have to pay a little bit to use it

01:21:08.319 --> 01:21:12.799
Caption: um and it&#39;s still not representative of

01:21:10.959 --> 01:21:15.279
Caption: real world traffic so we&#39;ve got more

01:21:12.799 --> 01:21:16.879
Caption: devices now um but at the end of the day

01:21:15.279 --> 01:21:17.919
Caption: those devices are still running in data

01:21:16.879 --> 01:21:19.439
Caption: centers

01:21:17.919 --> 01:21:20.799
Caption: and we&#39;re kind of

01:21:19.439 --> 01:21:22.000
Caption: assuming that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to behave

01:21:20.799 --> 01:21:25.919
Caption: on the real world but it&#39;s still not the

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.919
Caption: real world like i think we can do better

01:21:27.679 --> 01:21:32.479
Caption: why do i think this is important so

01:21:30.399 --> 01:21:34.158
Caption: if we look at browser engines uh we

01:21:32.479 --> 01:21:35.600
Caption: might be mistaken into thinking that

01:21:34.159 --> 01:21:37.600
Caption: there&#39;s not a whole lot of diversity

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:40.239
Caption: there so you&#39;ve got

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:42.399
Caption: webkit-based devices this is a

01:21:40.238 --> 01:21:44.399
Caption: traffic from a website that i i

01:21:42.399 --> 01:21:46.560
Caption: currently kind of maintain um so don&#39;t

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:49.359
Caption: know this is 100 accurate to i like

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:50.800
Caption: global statistics um but

01:21:49.359 --> 01:21:53.040
Caption: if we look at browser engines you&#39;ve got

01:21:50.799 --> 01:21:56.879
Caption: you&#39;ve got webkit so every single ios

01:21:53.040 --> 01:22:00.239
Caption: device um as well as some mac os desktop

01:21:56.879 --> 01:22:01.759
Caption: devices we&#39;ll be running webkit um i say

01:22:00.238 --> 01:22:04.319
Caption: every single ios device if you&#39;ve got

01:22:01.759 --> 01:22:06.799
Caption: google chrome on your iphone it&#39;s

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:09.359
Caption: actually webkit it&#39;s not google chrome

01:22:06.799 --> 01:22:12.000
Caption: and then the rest of it is blink so same

01:22:09.359 --> 01:22:13.439
Caption: same browser engine as google chrome

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.600
Caption: if you&#39;re running microsoft edge you&#39;ve

01:22:13.439 --> 01:22:17.919
Caption: got that so not a whole lot of diversity

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:19.760
Caption: there

01:22:17.919 --> 01:22:21.839
Caption: same with form factor we&#39;re down to sort

01:22:19.759 --> 01:22:24.319
Caption: of a two-speed world you&#39;ve got desktop

01:22:21.839 --> 01:22:26.959
Caption: devices and mobile devices you&#39;ve got a

01:22:24.319 --> 01:22:29.678
Caption: small sliver there for tvs or something

01:22:26.959 --> 01:22:29.679
Caption: tablets right

01:22:30.159 --> 01:22:33.679
Caption: but i think this is probably a naive way

01:22:31.679 --> 01:22:35.600
Caption: to look at it so you might look at these

01:22:33.679 --> 01:22:36.880
Caption: and go i really only need to test on an

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.800
Caption: iphone

01:22:36.879 --> 01:22:41.120
Caption: and maybe one android device and a

01:22:38.799 --> 01:22:42.000
Caption: windows desktop maybe that should be

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.639
Caption: enough

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.520
Caption: i don&#39;t think that&#39;s good enough

01:22:44.639 --> 01:22:50.400
Caption: let&#39;s have a look at um this is a a

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:52.159
Caption: graph showing the the single core scores

01:22:50.399 --> 01:22:55.359
Caption: of devices

01:22:52.159 --> 01:22:56.959
Caption: a wide range of devices mobile devices

01:22:55.359 --> 01:22:58.479
Caption: um it goes up to

01:22:56.959 --> 01:23:00.159
Caption: 2020

01:22:58.479 --> 01:23:02.000
Caption: so i think there&#39;s been some shifts as

01:23:00.159 --> 01:23:04.639
Caption: well but the really interesting thing

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.879
Caption: this is telling us is there&#39;s a huge

01:23:04.639 --> 01:23:08.959
Caption: like massive difference in performance

01:23:06.879 --> 01:23:11.520
Caption: between top-end devices and low-end

01:23:08.959 --> 01:23:13.279
Caption: devices and the problem here is the

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:15.199
Caption: majority of your users aren&#39;t running

01:23:13.279 --> 01:23:17.759
Caption: those top-end devices this is like if

01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:20.479
Caption: you&#39;re um who here has an iphone and is

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:21.439
Caption: running tests on it regularly cool one

01:23:20.479 --> 01:23:23.199
Caption: person

01:23:21.439 --> 01:23:24.560
Caption: um

01:23:23.199 --> 01:23:26.080
Caption: this one person i can tell you that

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:27.839
Caption: maybe uh what you&#39;re doing is not

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:31.520
Caption: representative of what the majority of

01:23:27.839 --> 01:23:31.520
Caption: your users are experiencing so

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:35.919
Caption: to put it another way um and this is

01:23:34.479 --> 01:23:37.279
Caption: obviously with old data we&#39;ve got a new

01:23:35.919 --> 01:23:39.359
Caption: iphone that&#39;s just come out so this is

01:23:37.279 --> 01:23:41.439
Caption: going to change again um the difference

01:23:39.359 --> 01:23:44.319
Caption: in performance between those two devices

01:23:41.439 --> 01:23:46.959
Caption: is so significant that uh

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:48.479
Caption: like this we&#39;ve got a coin we&#39;ve got a

01:23:46.959 --> 01:23:50.799
Caption: term that&#39;s been coined for this it&#39;s

01:23:48.479 --> 01:23:52.399
Caption: called the performance inequality gap

01:23:50.799 --> 01:23:54.158
Caption: um

01:23:52.399 --> 01:23:55.919
Caption: yeah that that&#39;s a that&#39;s a big

01:23:54.159 --> 01:23:57.920
Caption: difference there um that was actually

01:23:55.919 --> 01:23:59.120
Caption: coined by by this guy he&#39;s uh he does

01:23:57.919 --> 01:24:00.718
Caption: some really interesting talks on that

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:02.479
Caption: i&#39;ve got some links at the end to the

01:24:00.719 --> 01:24:03.840
Caption: talks that this guy&#39;s done before

01:24:02.479 --> 01:24:06.080
Caption: um

01:24:03.839 --> 01:24:07.520
Caption: he he has a really interesting part on

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:10.159
Caption: his talk where

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:12.879
Caption: uh he&#39;s running these performance ben uh

01:24:10.159 --> 01:24:14.080
Caption: performance benchmarks on these devices

01:24:12.879 --> 01:24:16.638
Caption: um and

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.359
Caption: just to sort of add add to this as well

01:24:16.639 --> 01:24:18.479
Caption: um

01:24:17.359 --> 01:24:20.799
Caption: he&#39;s got

01:24:18.479 --> 01:24:22.879
Caption: a nexus 5x he&#39;s tested at once and then

01:24:20.799 --> 01:24:25.439
Caption: he puts it on top of a block of ice

01:24:22.879 --> 01:24:27.678
Caption: and that that device now performs 15

01:24:25.439 --> 01:24:29.600
Caption: faster so that&#39;s really interesting this

01:24:27.679 --> 01:24:31.440
Caption: now means that environment the

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:33.120
Caption: environment which you run your your uh

01:24:31.439 --> 01:24:34.238
Caption: website and and these benchmarks are

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.239
Caption: working in

01:24:34.238 --> 01:24:38.000
Caption: also changes performance so that that

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:40.879
Caption: score that you had before that could be

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.639
Caption: 15 higher or 15 lower

01:24:40.879 --> 01:24:43.839
Caption: um and this isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t just sort

01:24:42.639 --> 01:24:45.760
Caption: of like no one&#39;s actually running their

01:24:43.839 --> 01:24:48.399
Caption: devices on a block of ice but if you&#39;re

01:24:45.759 --> 01:24:50.158
Caption: outside on a 40 degree day in perth you

01:24:48.399 --> 01:24:53.120
Caption: could actually have users that are

01:24:50.159 --> 01:24:54.239
Caption: experiencing your your site with 15 less

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.919
Caption: performance

01:24:54.238 --> 01:24:57.839
Caption: so this is this is a real thing that

01:24:55.919 --> 01:24:59.359
Caption: does come up when we&#39;re talking about

01:24:57.839 --> 01:25:01.678
Caption: real world sort of metrics and reward

01:24:59.359 --> 01:25:03.359
Caption: tracking

01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:05.120
Caption: another thing that&#39;s really important is

01:25:03.359 --> 01:25:07.678
Caption: i think a lot of us

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:10.560
Caption: work under the assumption that

01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:12.080
Caption: networks are widely widely a lot faster

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.679
Caption: and a lot more capable than they&#39;ve ever

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:17.520
Caption: been 4g itself is very widely available

01:25:15.679 --> 01:25:20.400
Caption: that&#39;s great that&#39;s a bit of a miracle

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:23.040
Caption: actually because it&#39;s pulling us forward

01:25:20.399 --> 01:25:25.678
Caption: we have a significant

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:27.359
Caption: reduction in in the use of like our sort

01:25:25.679 --> 01:25:30.159
Caption: of four second budget four seconds is

01:25:27.359 --> 01:25:32.319
Caption: for lcp um we&#39;ve got

01:25:30.159 --> 01:25:34.320
Caption: we&#39;ve made huge strides and and

01:25:32.319 --> 01:25:35.759
Caption: uh all sites are generally a lot better

01:25:34.319 --> 01:25:36.879
Caption: performing for this

01:25:35.759 --> 01:25:38.959
Caption: um but that only works under the

01:25:36.879 --> 01:25:41.279
Caption: assumption that 4g networks are evenly

01:25:38.959 --> 01:25:43.279
Caption: distributed which they&#39;re not

01:25:41.279 --> 01:25:46.718
Caption: if we look at the sort of variance

01:25:43.279 --> 01:25:48.799
Caption: within wa in 4g network speeds at the

01:25:46.719 --> 01:25:50.639
Caption: low end you&#39;ve got about 18 megabytes

01:25:48.799 --> 01:25:52.399
Caption: per second and at the high end

01:25:50.639 --> 01:25:54.800
Caption: you&#39;re talking almost 10 times higher

01:25:52.399 --> 01:25:57.040
Caption: than that

01:25:54.799 --> 01:25:59.439
Caption: same goes for latency

01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:01.839
Caption: latency can differ very significantly

01:25:59.439 --> 01:26:04.319
Caption: particularly on for 4g networks 4g by

01:26:01.839 --> 01:26:07.520
Caption: the way networks the majority of devices

01:26:04.319 --> 01:26:08.799
Caption: are browsing on as well so

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.159
Caption: uh that that is where you&#39;re going to

01:26:08.799 --> 01:26:12.000
Caption: see the majority of your devices and the

01:26:10.159 --> 01:26:13.679
Caption: majority of of your users with their

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.600
Caption: devices are going to be experiencing

01:26:13.679 --> 01:26:17.600
Caption: this sort of variance in performance

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:20.879
Caption: so hopefully that tells you that we

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:23.279
Caption: probably need to actually start

01:26:20.879 --> 01:26:24.799
Caption: monitoring on real devices so that we

01:26:23.279 --> 01:26:26.479
Caption: can account for

01:26:24.799 --> 01:26:28.799
Caption: environmental factors different 4g

01:26:26.479 --> 01:26:31.279
Caption: networks and different temperatures as

01:26:28.799 --> 01:26:34.319
Caption: it turns out as well as different cpu

01:26:31.279 --> 01:26:34.319
Caption: performance on devices

01:26:34.799 --> 01:26:38.399
Caption: so what is real user monitoring

01:26:36.879 --> 01:26:40.158
Caption: real user monitoring is capturing

01:26:38.399 --> 01:26:41.839
Caption: performance metrics directly from

01:26:40.159 --> 01:26:44.800
Caption: devices so that we can observe

01:26:41.839 --> 01:26:47.678
Caption: differences in functionality reliability

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:47.678
Caption: and responsiveness

01:26:47.839 --> 01:26:52.479
Caption: so an example of how to do

01:26:50.799 --> 01:26:54.079
Caption: real user monitoring

01:26:52.479 --> 01:26:55.040
Caption: might be the chrome user experience

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.919
Caption: report

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:58.080
Caption: so

01:26:55.919 --> 01:26:59.439
Caption: i think we all know that chrome

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.359
Caption: while you&#39;re browsing the internet is

01:26:59.439 --> 01:27:02.799
Caption: doing all sorts of tracking

01:27:01.359 --> 01:27:05.198
Caption: some of it&#39;s good some of it&#39;s not so

01:27:02.799 --> 01:27:08.319
Caption: good this is maybe one of the

01:27:05.199 --> 01:27:10.479
Caption: the gooder ones i&#39;d say um

01:27:08.319 --> 01:27:12.560
Caption: every single website you visit google is

01:27:10.479 --> 01:27:14.799
Caption: sending uh it&#39;s it&#39;s anonymizing and

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.679
Caption: then sending um

01:27:14.799 --> 01:27:20.319
Caption: web vitals metrics to itself it collates

01:27:17.679 --> 01:27:23.040
Caption: all of those metrics and makes this data

01:27:20.319 --> 01:27:24.638
Caption: set completely free and available to you

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.319
Caption: so you can pull down this data set now

01:27:24.639 --> 01:27:28.080
Caption: for a site that you manage

01:27:26.319 --> 01:27:29.678
Caption: and you can see how it&#39;s performing on

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:33.159
Caption: real-world devices

01:27:29.679 --> 01:27:33.159
Caption: across the internet

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.639
Caption: the chrome user experience report is

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.479
Caption: great because it&#39;s free you can see i

01:27:38.639 --> 01:27:42.320
Caption: can go and see the chrome user

01:27:40.479 --> 01:27:45.520
Caption: experience report for google.com or

01:27:42.319 --> 01:27:47.839
Caption: facebook.com it&#39;s widely available

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:49.279
Caption: it does do real user monitoring so cool

01:27:47.839 --> 01:27:51.839
Caption: fix that box

01:27:49.279 --> 01:27:53.439
Caption: the one downside is that uh it doesn&#39;t

01:27:51.839 --> 01:27:56.158
Caption: give you these metrics in real time so

01:27:53.439 --> 01:27:58.399
Caption: you can pull this report once a month

01:27:56.159 --> 01:28:00.159
Caption: um that&#39;s that&#39;s a bit unfortunate

01:27:58.399 --> 01:28:01.678
Caption: because if we wanted to if we made a

01:28:00.159 --> 01:28:03.120
Caption: change and we were worried about the

01:28:01.679 --> 01:28:05.360
Caption: performance

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:07.520
Caption: that feedback loop is too long

01:28:05.359 --> 01:28:09.678
Caption: what happens there is uh you might make

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:10.799
Caption: a sort of a performance regression

01:28:09.679 --> 01:28:12.320
Caption: you incur

01:28:10.799 --> 01:28:14.000
Caption: the cost of that performance regression

01:28:12.319 --> 01:28:15.839
Caption: for entire month before knowing that

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.359
Caption: you&#39;ve done that and then then you have

01:28:15.839 --> 01:28:20.158
Caption: to go and try and figure out what caused

01:28:17.359 --> 01:28:21.600
Caption: that a month later so that&#39;s not ideal

01:28:20.159 --> 01:28:23.679
Caption: the other thing is this only profiles

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.919
Caption: google chrome devices so you don&#39;t get

01:28:23.679 --> 01:28:27.520
Caption: realistic real user monitoring for ios

01:28:25.919 --> 01:28:29.839
Caption: devices based on webkit and actually not

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:32.159
Caption: even all chrome devices um just google

01:28:29.839 --> 01:28:33.359
Caption: chrome so not like blink uh microsoft

01:28:32.159 --> 01:28:36.320
Caption: edge or anything like that they&#39;re not

01:28:33.359 --> 01:28:39.919
Caption: sending data to google for you

01:28:36.319 --> 01:28:42.560
Caption: so it&#39;s not representing everyone

01:28:39.919 --> 01:28:44.080
Caption: here&#39;s another tool um this kind of

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:45.120
Caption: fixes the uh

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.199
Caption: with the

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:48.399
Caption: google chrome user experience report um

01:28:47.199 --> 01:28:49.600
Caption: there&#39;s a couple of hoops you have to

01:28:48.399 --> 01:28:51.279
Caption: jump through you have to get a google

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:53.439
Caption: account and then use this data studio

01:28:51.279 --> 01:28:54.718
Caption: thing um set it up this kind of just

01:28:53.439 --> 01:28:55.839
Caption: makes this a whole lot easier you don&#39;t

01:28:54.719 --> 01:28:57.840
Caption: have to create an account or anything

01:28:55.839 --> 01:29:00.000
Caption: like that you can just plug in a site

01:28:57.839 --> 01:29:01.759
Caption: right now anyone here could just do this

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.080
Caption: in about two seconds it&#39;s made by the

01:29:01.759 --> 01:29:05.919
Caption: caliber people too

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:07.600
Caption: and

01:29:05.919 --> 01:29:09.279
Caption: i&#39;ve been told to put the sponsor slide

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.879
Caption: either at the beginning or the end so

01:29:09.279 --> 01:29:12.238
Caption: the ddd people are probably panicking

01:29:10.879 --> 01:29:13.919
Caption: now because i&#39;m about halfway through

01:29:12.238 --> 01:29:14.959
Caption: and i&#39;ve got the slide here like is he

01:29:13.919 --> 01:29:16.158
Caption: finished

01:29:14.959 --> 01:29:17.919
Caption: now um

01:29:16.159 --> 01:29:19.120
Caption: i&#39;ve decided to do something probably

01:29:17.919 --> 01:29:21.198
Caption: that might get me a little bit in

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:22.399
Caption: trouble but i&#39;m going to do a sponsor

01:29:21.199 --> 01:29:24.639
Caption: leaderboard so i&#39;m going to go through

01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:27.678
Caption: all of the sponsors to tell you how fast

01:29:24.639 --> 01:29:27.679
Caption: your sites are going to perform

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.560
Caption: yeah yeah all right so um

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.600
Caption: just some ground rules when we start um

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.639
Caption: this is how i&#39;m going to run the tool

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:38.399
Caption: i&#39;m going to run it across the whole

01:29:36.639 --> 01:29:39.919
Caption: domain you tend to get better results

01:29:38.399 --> 01:29:41.279
Caption: it&#39;s more representative of everything

01:29:39.919 --> 01:29:43.678
Caption: that&#39;s going on

01:29:41.279 --> 01:29:44.959
Caption: as well as

01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:46.880
Caption: there are some sites that aren&#39;t going

01:29:44.959 --> 01:29:48.639
Caption: to have enough traffic so you need i

01:29:46.879 --> 01:29:51.120
Caption: think at least a thousand visits on

01:29:48.639 --> 01:29:52.479
Caption: google chrome per month so some of them

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.360
Caption: are going to get missed out there

01:29:52.479 --> 01:29:55.839
Caption: and the other thing is i&#39;m going to

01:29:53.359 --> 01:29:57.919
Caption: order this dashboard um in

01:29:55.839 --> 01:29:59.599
Caption: descending order from

01:29:57.919 --> 01:30:01.520
Caption: the lcp metric because i think that

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:02.879
Caption: one&#39;s most important we touched on that

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:05.600
Caption: before the

01:30:02.879 --> 01:30:07.439
Caption: case study for vodafone that tends to be

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:10.879
Caption: the one that&#39;s tied to commercial

01:30:07.439 --> 01:30:12.879
Caption: benefit so we&#39;re gonna go that one

01:30:10.879 --> 01:30:16.238
Caption: so a couple of people got off the hook

01:30:12.879 --> 01:30:18.319
Caption: um didn&#39;t get enough traffic so

01:30:16.238 --> 01:30:21.678
Caption: good for them

01:30:18.319 --> 01:30:22.638
Caption: maybe next year

01:30:21.679 --> 01:30:25.040
Caption: uh and this one&#39;s a little bit

01:30:22.639 --> 01:30:26.479
Caption: embarrassing so i i work for one of

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:29.280
Caption: these companies it&#39;s the one on number

01:30:26.479 --> 01:30:32.159
Caption: 20 there so what happened there um i can

01:30:29.279 --> 01:30:33.919
Caption: i can explain that and i think i will um

01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:36.320
Caption: that website there is more so a

01:30:33.919 --> 01:30:38.399
Caption: recruitment tool than it is the website

01:30:36.319 --> 01:30:39.520
Caption: that we uh derive commercial benefit

01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:42.238
Caption: from so

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:44.319
Caption: that&#39;s why that&#39;s like that also uh i

01:30:42.238 --> 01:30:46.238
Caption: have nothing to do with that one so

01:30:44.319 --> 01:30:48.158
Caption: that&#39;s probably why it&#39;s like that

01:30:46.238 --> 01:30:50.399
Caption: um some other interesting scores here we

01:30:48.159 --> 01:30:52.880
Caption: have the lowest score obviously for fcp

01:30:50.399 --> 01:30:54.638
Caption: and lcp on this on this dashboard really

01:30:52.879 --> 01:30:56.799
Caption: interesting though that for insight not

01:30:54.639 --> 01:30:59.360
Caption: sure what happened um

01:30:56.799 --> 01:31:00.638
Caption: the fcp is larger than the lcp so a bit

01:30:59.359 --> 01:31:02.799
Caption: confusing i don&#39;t think that&#39;s actually

01:31:00.639 --> 01:31:05.120
Caption: possible maybe that&#39;s a dud result scrub

01:31:02.799 --> 01:31:06.879
Caption: that off now we&#39;re last great

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:08.800
Caption: there&#39;s also a zero score for cumulative

01:31:06.879 --> 01:31:10.718
Caption: layout shift here so good good on family

01:31:08.799 --> 01:31:12.559
Caption: zone for doing that

01:31:10.719 --> 01:31:14.320
Caption: let&#39;s move up the board here

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:16.959
Caption: some more interesting results

01:31:14.319 --> 01:31:19.198
Caption: uh what have we got um planet testing

01:31:16.959 --> 01:31:21.279
Caption: has a uh interesting score for

01:31:19.199 --> 01:31:23.280
Caption: cumulative layout shift of one i&#39;m not

01:31:21.279 --> 01:31:25.279
Caption: sure what to make of that um that&#39;s a

01:31:23.279 --> 01:31:26.879
Caption: bit odd to me maybe that&#39;s just a bad

01:31:25.279 --> 01:31:28.158
Caption: result as well

01:31:26.879 --> 01:31:30.799
Caption: we&#39;ve got bunnings along the middle

01:31:28.159 --> 01:31:33.520
Caption: there um i should say that uh when i&#39;m

01:31:30.799 --> 01:31:36.000
Caption: identifying this stuff obviously this is

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:38.479
Caption: this could be taken or construed as a

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.159
Caption: bit of a roast um but i also say this is

01:31:38.479 --> 01:31:41.919
Caption: an opportunity for improvement until you

01:31:40.159 --> 01:31:44.479
Caption: see something like this

01:31:41.919 --> 01:31:46.639
Caption: anyone work for bunnings

01:31:44.479 --> 01:31:48.319
Caption: cool at the back this is a really

01:31:46.639 --> 01:31:49.600
Caption: there&#39;s probably something really simple

01:31:48.319 --> 01:31:50.879
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s causing something like

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:53.040
Caption: this especially if it&#39;s right across the

01:31:50.879 --> 01:31:55.600
Caption: board so there might be opportunity for

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.479
Caption: improvement uh here um have a quick look

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.879
Caption: at it

01:31:56.479 --> 01:32:01.199
Caption: it might sort of highlight something uh

01:31:58.879 --> 01:32:03.600
Caption: that you hadn&#39;t seen before

01:32:01.199 --> 01:32:05.360
Caption: uh we&#39;ve also got the best score for

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:07.919
Caption: first input delay from telstra purple

01:32:05.359 --> 01:32:09.919
Caption: here so good for them and i i&#39;ve got an

01:32:07.919 --> 01:32:12.399
Caption: interesting result here as well so bank

01:32:09.919 --> 01:32:13.759
Caption: west best score for time to first buy

01:32:12.399 --> 01:32:15.759
Caption: awesome

01:32:13.759 --> 01:32:17.759
Caption: better than aws

01:32:15.759 --> 01:32:19.599
Caption: so global

01:32:17.759 --> 01:32:20.479
Caption: globally redundant

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.719
Caption: uh

01:32:20.479 --> 01:32:25.600
Caption: massive network probably the largest

01:32:22.719 --> 01:32:27.199
Caption: single network in in history ever made

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:28.959
Caption: and bankwest dingy little bank from

01:32:27.199 --> 01:32:30.400
Caption: perth better time to first bite so

01:32:28.959 --> 01:32:33.679
Caption: whatever whatever the bankwest people

01:32:30.399 --> 01:32:33.678
Caption: are doing is probably pretty good

01:32:34.238 --> 01:32:37.599
Caption: yeah yeah so actually that is a good

01:32:35.759 --> 01:32:39.439
Caption: point um data center and customers

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:41.120
Caption: majority in perth so

01:32:39.439 --> 01:32:44.959
Caption: that&#39;s probably where that&#39;s coming from

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:47.520
Caption: obviously aws much more distributed so

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:49.600
Caption: now and here&#39;s the final result so

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.879
Caption: who saw that one coming uh dd perth

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:52.719
Caption: number two there&#39;s obviously some really

01:32:50.879 --> 01:32:54.638
Caption: smart people putting that one together

01:32:52.719 --> 01:32:57.040
Caption: the only green across-the-board score

01:32:54.639 --> 01:32:59.280
Caption: was versace so good job to them and then

01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:00.879
Caption: number one score is github

01:32:59.279 --> 01:33:03.520
Caption: um anyone have any theories about why

01:33:00.879 --> 01:33:07.198
Caption: github&#39;s number one aside from massive

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:07.199
Caption: investment in web performance

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.840
Caption: race

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:16.800
Caption: yep

01:33:14.879 --> 01:33:18.399
Caption: so for anyone who didn&#39;t hear yeah

01:33:16.799 --> 01:33:20.399
Caption: reese&#39;s mom doesn&#39;t use github as it

01:33:18.399 --> 01:33:21.520
Caption: turns out i kind of i kind of assumed

01:33:20.399 --> 01:33:22.879
Caption: she did but

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:26.159
Caption: um

01:33:22.879 --> 01:33:28.479
Caption: also yeah uh desktop devices majority of

01:33:26.159 --> 01:33:30.400
Caption: people with like high powered devices

01:33:28.479 --> 01:33:31.839
Caption: largely text-based pretty much all tech

01:33:30.399 --> 01:33:33.919
Caption: space as well that tends to help so

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:35.198
Caption: largest contentful paint um if you&#39;ve

01:33:33.919 --> 01:33:37.279
Caption: got images on the page you&#39;ll be

01:33:35.199 --> 01:33:39.760
Caption: impacted by that so some of these scores

01:33:37.279 --> 01:33:41.198
Caption: as well should be mentioned that um take

01:33:39.759 --> 01:33:42.718
Caption: them with a bit of a grain of salt it&#39;s

01:33:41.199 --> 01:33:44.560
Caption: like it&#39;s not that github is doing

01:33:42.719 --> 01:33:46.719
Caption: something particularly special sometimes

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:48.000
Caption: it&#39;s actually more more the user base

01:33:46.719 --> 01:33:49.920
Caption: themselves

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.759
Caption: but again yeah plenty of opportunity for

01:33:49.919 --> 01:33:52.959
Caption: improvement here as well particularly if

01:33:51.759 --> 01:33:54.799
Caption: you&#39;ve got some of the results on this

01:33:52.959 --> 01:33:56.799
Caption: sort of part of the board as well um

01:33:54.799 --> 01:33:58.000
Caption: there might be something really simple

01:33:56.799 --> 01:33:59.678
Caption: i&#39;m not going to talk about that in this

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Caption: talk though that&#39;s probably the next one

01:33:59.679 --> 01:34:03.280
Caption: see you next year

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.040
Caption: all right so we figured out how to

01:34:03.279 --> 01:34:06.479
Caption: capture metrics from end user devices

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.399
Caption: there&#39;s a number of really easy ways to

01:34:06.479 --> 01:34:09.839
Caption: do it

01:34:08.399 --> 01:34:11.759
Caption: but we&#39;re still missing continuous

01:34:09.839 --> 01:34:13.759
Caption: observability so we&#39;ve got our chrome

01:34:11.759 --> 01:34:15.678
Caption: user experience report we can get these

01:34:13.759 --> 01:34:17.119
Caption: we can get this data

01:34:15.679 --> 01:34:18.080
Caption: but we can get it once a month so that&#39;s

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:21.760
Caption: not really good enough we need to be

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:21.760
Caption: able to see this data at real time

01:34:22.879 --> 01:34:27.359
Caption: now here&#39;s a bit of a our progress as we

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.199
Caption: go here so you can see

01:34:27.359 --> 01:34:30.560
Caption: we&#39;re improving along the way there but

01:34:29.199 --> 01:34:32.159
Caption: we don&#39;t currently have that solution

01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:34.959
Caption: that gives us all three we haven&#39;t quite

01:34:32.159 --> 01:34:34.959
Caption: worked that out yet

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:41.120
Caption: so if we if we can&#39;t find an off shelf

01:34:38.799 --> 01:34:42.479
Caption: off the shelf tool um why don&#39;t we just

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:44.320
Caption: ask ourselves

01:34:42.479 --> 01:34:46.399
Caption: is it really that hard to build yourself

01:34:44.319 --> 01:34:48.799
Caption: an analytics service can we build it

01:34:46.399 --> 01:34:50.000
Caption: ourselves we might as well have a try

01:34:48.799 --> 01:34:51.599
Caption: we&#39;ve been through all the tools nothing

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.879
Caption: seems to be quite hitting the mark on

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.399
Caption: all three

01:34:52.879 --> 01:34:55.600
Caption: uh actually turns out it&#39;s really easy

01:34:54.399 --> 01:34:57.359
Caption: so

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:59.760
Caption: you can grab this library this is the

01:34:57.359 --> 01:35:01.600
Caption: web vitals library it&#39;s the same

01:34:59.759 --> 01:35:03.119
Caption: library that i guess they built into

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:05.120
Caption: google chrome it can give you the same

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:06.719
Caption: scores but you can run javascript you

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.320
Caption: can pull that down and um

01:35:06.719 --> 01:35:11.360
Caption: it looks a bit but a little bit like

01:35:08.319 --> 01:35:14.319
Caption: this you can just import a bunch of

01:35:11.359 --> 01:35:16.238
Caption: functions you can add callbacks to them

01:35:14.319 --> 01:35:18.238
Caption: that send to analytics function i&#39;ll get

01:35:16.238 --> 01:35:19.439
Caption: to that in a sec but um we can also

01:35:18.238 --> 01:35:20.718
Caption: while we&#39;re here if we&#39;re going to send

01:35:19.439 --> 01:35:22.399
Caption: something to our little analytics

01:35:20.719 --> 01:35:24.800
Caption: service we can capture some other stuff

01:35:22.399 --> 01:35:27.040
Caption: as well so javascript errors

01:35:24.799 --> 01:35:29.520
Caption: content security policy violations we

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:31.199
Caption: can send all of that stuff down there

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:32.319
Caption: that center analytics function looks

01:35:31.199 --> 01:35:34.400
Caption: like this

01:35:32.319 --> 01:35:35.919
Caption: uh it maybe looks a little i&#39;ve got i&#39;ve

01:35:34.399 --> 01:35:38.319
Caption: got prettier run over this so maybe

01:35:35.919 --> 01:35:41.040
Caption: looks a little bit hard to read

01:35:38.319 --> 01:35:42.638
Caption: it just sends a sends a request down to

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:45.679
Caption: a server so we can start reporting these

01:35:42.639 --> 01:35:47.520
Caption: metrics that navigator.sendbeacon way is

01:35:45.679 --> 01:35:49.360
Caption: a better better way to send metrics like

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:51.199
Caption: this because it can

01:35:49.359 --> 01:35:53.439
Caption: finish the request

01:35:51.199 --> 01:35:55.600
Caption: after your or somewhat after your page

01:35:53.439 --> 01:35:57.120
Caption: unloads um goes to the next page so if

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:58.639
Caption: your user clicks on on something and you

01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:00.159
Caption: really want to quickly report a metric

01:35:58.639 --> 01:36:01.760
Caption: there or an error or something like that

01:36:00.159 --> 01:36:05.360
Caption: that&#39;s more likely to capture it but

01:36:01.759 --> 01:36:05.359
Caption: let&#39;s fall back to fetch just in case

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:08.159
Caption: and

01:36:06.639 --> 01:36:10.000
Caption: i&#39;m doing a bit of like i&#39;m doing a bit

01:36:08.159 --> 01:36:11.679
Caption: of code golf here so i&#39;ve tried to

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.679
Caption: compress it all into one page but this

01:36:11.679 --> 01:36:14.959
Caption: is the entire server this is the whole

01:36:13.679 --> 01:36:16.479
Caption: thing

01:36:14.959 --> 01:36:18.879
Caption: um so really

01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:20.399
Caption: 24 lines of code is all it took

01:36:18.879 --> 01:36:22.158
Caption: we can see here that we&#39;re importing

01:36:20.399 --> 01:36:23.678
Caption: this prom client library which is the

01:36:22.159 --> 01:36:24.639
Caption: prometheus library we&#39;ll get to that in

01:36:23.679 --> 01:36:27.199
Caption: a minute

01:36:24.639 --> 01:36:28.800
Caption: we can set up a metrics like this

01:36:27.199 --> 01:36:30.560
Caption: we&#39;re using summary metrics so that

01:36:28.799 --> 01:36:32.158
Caption: allows us to observe uh time

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:33.439
Caption: distributions

01:36:32.159 --> 01:36:35.439
Caption: and then that&#39;s the service just an

01:36:33.439 --> 01:36:37.040
Caption: express web server depending on which

01:36:35.439 --> 01:36:40.639
Caption: metric we get back

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:40.639
Caption: we&#39;ll just observe each one of those

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:44.959
Caption: so then moving on from there we&#39;ve got

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:47.679
Caption: our analytics server in the middle um

01:36:44.959 --> 01:36:49.839
Caption: and then because it&#39;s just a

01:36:47.679 --> 01:36:50.800
Caption: really simple web server we don&#39;t have

01:36:49.839 --> 01:36:52.399
Caption: um

01:36:50.799 --> 01:36:54.000
Caption: it&#39;s not sort of um paired with a

01:36:52.399 --> 01:36:55.520
Caption: database there&#39;s no persistence or

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.520
Caption: anything like that we can keep our

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:59.679
Caption: metrics in memory and the way of doing

01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:02.639
Caption: this with prometheus is it&#39;s pull-based

01:36:59.679 --> 01:37:04.320
Caption: so that&#39;s polling on a continuous basis

01:37:02.639 --> 01:37:05.760
Caption: our analytics service for the latest

01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:06.479
Caption: version of the metrics keeping track of

01:37:05.759 --> 01:37:08.158
Caption: that

01:37:06.479 --> 01:37:10.000
Caption: and then we&#39;ve got grafana slapped on

01:37:08.159 --> 01:37:11.280
Caption: top of that because grafina has really

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.639
Caption: nice pretty graphs which we&#39;ll show in a

01:37:11.279 --> 01:37:14.559
Caption: minute

01:37:12.639 --> 01:37:17.119
Caption: but this is dead simple and because we

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:18.719
Caption: rolled our own analytics service

01:37:17.119 --> 01:37:20.399
Caption: i&#39;m not going to tell you all to use

01:37:18.719 --> 01:37:21.840
Caption: prometheus and grafana that&#39;s what i use

01:37:20.399 --> 01:37:24.238
Caption: but there&#39;s nothing stopping you from

01:37:21.839 --> 01:37:26.560
Caption: hooking this up to honeycomb or sending

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:27.678
Caption: this data to new relic if you wanted to

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:29.359
Caption: there&#39;s about a million different

01:37:27.679 --> 01:37:30.479
Caption: options for this and you can send it

01:37:29.359 --> 01:37:32.080
Caption: wherever you want and because you&#39;ve

01:37:30.479 --> 01:37:35.839
Caption: written your own code for this

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:35.839
Caption: that is completely up to you

01:37:35.919 --> 01:37:39.040
Caption: so here&#39;s another example where we might

01:37:37.759 --> 01:37:41.599
Caption: want to

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:43.839
Caption: store our metrics for more long-term use

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:46.560
Caption: so you&#39;ve got amazon kinesis fire hose

01:37:43.839 --> 01:37:48.560
Caption: and s3 and then you can use snowflake to

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:51.439
Caption: run queries over that data

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:53.280
Caption: um dead simple also there&#39;s probably 15

01:37:51.439 --> 01:37:55.040
Caption: 000 different ways to do this as well

01:37:53.279 --> 01:37:56.959
Caption: this is just one example

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.799
Caption: and i i don&#39;t we don&#39;t do this yet but

01:37:56.959 --> 01:38:00.479
Caption: um yeah i can i can see there being

01:37:58.799 --> 01:38:01.919
Caption: value and sort of having a long long

01:38:00.479 --> 01:38:03.520
Caption: term trends for those metrics rather

01:38:01.919 --> 01:38:05.119
Caption: than something that lives in memory so

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:06.879
Caption: as soon as those

01:38:05.119 --> 01:38:09.360
Caption: containers are dead then you have to

01:38:06.879 --> 01:38:09.359
Caption: start again

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.479
Caption: and this is what we end up with so this

01:38:11.759 --> 01:38:14.319
Caption: is

01:38:12.479 --> 01:38:16.399
Caption: grafana a

01:38:14.319 --> 01:38:18.399
Caption: quick video from grafana we&#39;re tracking

01:38:16.399 --> 01:38:20.560
Caption: all of those metrics we&#39;ve got

01:38:18.399 --> 01:38:22.080
Caption: um an instant instantaneous score so

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:24.479
Caption: that&#39;s really helpful for

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.600
Caption: um if we&#39;ve made a quick change we can

01:38:24.479 --> 01:38:27.359
Caption: just look at that and see if that

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:29.439
Caption: number&#39;s gone up we can observe trends

01:38:27.359 --> 01:38:30.799
Caption: over time i&#39;ve got heat maps there so

01:38:29.439 --> 01:38:32.319
Caption: i&#39;ve got a um

01:38:30.799 --> 01:38:34.638
Caption: a histogram type

01:38:32.319 --> 01:38:36.399
Caption: uh metric as well and that allows us to

01:38:34.639 --> 01:38:38.560
Caption: sort of see that distribution

01:38:36.399 --> 01:38:39.839
Caption: over time and we can kind of observe any

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:41.839
Caption: of those trends there so that&#39;s really

01:38:39.839 --> 01:38:44.638
Caption: useful i really like the one in the

01:38:41.839 --> 01:38:47.599
Caption: bottom right as well those are tied to

01:38:44.639 --> 01:38:49.280
Caption: the actual performance scores

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.840
Caption: that i showed you before so

01:38:49.279 --> 01:38:54.079
Caption: green is uh in that good space and then

01:38:51.839 --> 01:38:55.520
Caption: anything above that is red

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:57.280
Caption: we can see how often we&#39;re going into

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.839
Caption: that red there so that&#39;s really really

01:38:57.279 --> 01:38:59.839
Caption: helpful too

01:39:00.159 --> 01:39:03.119
Caption: if you remember we

01:39:01.439 --> 01:39:04.799
Caption: also sent some other stuff to our

01:39:03.119 --> 01:39:06.399
Caption: analytics service so

01:39:04.799 --> 01:39:07.599
Caption: now that we&#39;ve got this this server we

01:39:06.399 --> 01:39:09.439
Caption: can kind of start reporting on

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:11.119
Caption: everything that&#39;s going on as well so

01:39:09.439 --> 01:39:13.359
Caption: i&#39;ve got some geo-location stuff in

01:39:11.119 --> 01:39:14.800
Caption: there which devices

01:39:13.359 --> 01:39:16.479
Caption: people are using because we have our own

01:39:14.799 --> 01:39:18.959
Caption: analytics server it&#39;s really easy to

01:39:16.479 --> 01:39:20.879
Caption: just keep adding more to it

01:39:18.959 --> 01:39:23.839
Caption: this is where i got the device data from

01:39:20.879 --> 01:39:25.939
Caption: as well from the previous slides

01:39:23.839 --> 01:39:27.279
Caption: so yeah to recap

01:39:25.939 --> 01:39:28.879
Caption: [Music]

01:39:27.279 --> 01:39:30.799
Caption: best way to do web performance

01:39:28.879 --> 01:39:32.638
Caption: monitoring is to do three things you

01:39:30.799 --> 01:39:34.638
Caption: need user-centric performance metrics

01:39:32.639 --> 01:39:37.600
Caption: you need to capture those performance

01:39:34.639 --> 01:39:39.199
Caption: metrics from real-world devices

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.560
Caption: and you need to be able to continuously

01:39:39.199 --> 01:39:41.600
Caption: observe those so we need to be able to

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.719
Caption: see

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:45.520
Caption: the advantage of being able to

01:39:42.719 --> 01:39:47.600
Caption: continuously observe is

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:49.439
Caption: we can capture a quick regression we can

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:51.199
Caption: have a pr that gets merged everything

01:39:49.439 --> 01:39:53.359
Caption: starts running oh look it&#39;s something&#39;s

01:39:51.199 --> 01:39:55.119
Caption: gone wrong the performance profile has

01:39:53.359 --> 01:39:56.799
Caption: changed in the wrong way we can roll

01:39:55.119 --> 01:39:58.560
Caption: that back very quickly

01:39:56.799 --> 01:40:00.799
Caption: um yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s all of it that&#39;s

01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:01.839
Caption: that&#39;s the three the three goals we did

01:40:00.799 --> 01:40:05.079
Caption: it

01:40:01.839 --> 01:40:05.080
Caption: thanks everyone

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.359
Caption: that&#39;s me if you want to

01:40:11.439 --> 01:40:14.319
Caption: if you want to like attack me on twitter

01:40:13.359 --> 01:40:16.560
Caption: for uh

01:40:14.319 --> 01:40:17.678
Caption: roasting the place where you work so

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:19.439
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s how you do that if you

01:40:17.679 --> 01:40:21.840
Caption: want to know

01:40:19.439 --> 01:40:23.839
Caption: i&#39;ve also got all the resources here you

01:40:21.839 --> 01:40:25.759
Caption: can find my slides

01:40:23.839 --> 01:40:27.118
Caption: using using any of those links there

01:40:25.759 --> 01:40:28.638
Caption: i&#39;ll share them out

01:40:27.119 --> 01:40:30.159
Caption: so all the resources everything i talked

01:40:28.639 --> 01:40:31.760
Caption: about there

01:40:30.159 --> 01:40:34.080
Caption: here&#39;s how to

01:40:31.759 --> 01:40:36.000
Caption: learn about all of those metrics as well

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.679
Caption: more than just the 10 seconds i gave

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.040
Caption: them on stage

01:40:37.679 --> 01:40:40.560
Caption: here&#39;s some really useful tools so all

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:43.040
Caption: the tools i covered versus some other

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:45.679
Caption: stuff as well

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.520
Caption: has anyone got any questions

01:40:45.679 --> 01:40:49.520
Caption: rhys

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.279
Caption: making me nervous man

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:54.000
Caption: um i just wanted to

01:40:51.279 --> 01:40:55.839
Caption: get your opinion so there was um google

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.359
Caption: had those kind of

01:40:55.839 --> 01:40:59.118
Caption: green to red

01:40:57.359 --> 01:41:00.799
Caption: not so good good

01:40:59.119 --> 01:41:02.320
Caption: i was kind of surprised

01:41:00.799 --> 01:41:04.959
Caption: that the numbers nowadays are still

01:41:02.319 --> 01:41:07.759
Caption: quite high i think you said 1.8 seconds

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:16.479
Caption: your feelings on that am i being

01:41:13.679 --> 01:41:17.920
Caption: ridiculous or is what&#39;s good for macklin

01:41:16.479 --> 01:41:19.199
Caption: what do you think is good what are you

01:41:17.919 --> 01:41:20.879
Caption: aiming for

01:41:19.199 --> 01:41:22.320
Caption: i think you might be surprised um like

01:41:20.879 --> 01:41:23.520
Caption: if we go back to i&#39;m not gonna go back

01:41:22.319 --> 01:41:24.959
Caption: to the leaderboards you guys don&#39;t need

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:27.359
Caption: to see that again but if you go back to

01:41:24.959 --> 01:41:28.718
Caption: the leaderboards um quite a lot of first

01:41:27.359 --> 01:41:30.839
Caption: contentful paint i don&#39;t think anyone

01:41:28.719 --> 01:41:33.040
Caption: got less than a second um less than a

01:41:30.839 --> 01:41:34.959
Caption: second sounds really good that sounds

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:36.399
Caption: like what you&#39;d want but um

01:41:34.959 --> 01:41:39.279
Caption: it is actually pretty hard to get to

01:41:36.399 --> 01:41:41.119
Caption: that to that score um and i think google

01:41:39.279 --> 01:41:42.638
Caption: has said it in such a way that i think

01:41:41.119 --> 01:41:45.439
Caption: it accounts for

01:41:42.639 --> 01:41:46.479
Caption: uh accounts for that variability so not

01:41:45.439 --> 01:41:47.919
Caption: everyone has

01:41:46.479 --> 01:41:50.399
Caption: a device that&#39;s going to ensure that we

01:41:47.919 --> 01:41:52.158
Caption: can get it in 1.8 seconds the majority

01:41:50.399 --> 01:41:54.479
Caption: of people have devices that are

01:41:52.159 --> 01:41:56.560
Caption: significantly slower than the device you

01:41:54.479 --> 01:41:58.718
Caption: and i probably use um it&#39;s accounting

01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:00.399
Caption: for that it&#39;s accounting for people in

01:41:58.719 --> 01:42:03.040
Caption: in

01:42:00.399 --> 01:42:04.799
Caption: jurisdictions like geo locations like uh

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:06.000
Caption: rural australia or

01:42:04.799 --> 01:42:07.678
Caption: um

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.040
Caption: parts of india and stuff like that where

01:42:07.679 --> 01:42:10.639
Caption: they are going to not actually be able

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.639
Caption: to attain that level of performance as

01:42:10.639 --> 01:42:13.639
Caption: well

01:42:20.799 --> 01:42:25.599
Caption: um one of the 4g providers was 10 times

01:42:23.919 --> 01:42:28.479
Caption: faster than the others do you know who

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:30.239
Caption: that was so i can switch my mobile plan

01:42:28.479 --> 01:42:32.159
Caption: so the question was one of the one of

01:42:30.238 --> 01:42:35.599
Caption: the 4g providers was really fast that

01:42:32.159 --> 01:42:37.840
Caption: was actually based on location so um

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:38.639
Caption: and it wasn&#39;t perth either so that that

01:42:37.839 --> 01:42:39.520
Caption: that

01:42:38.639 --> 01:42:42.639
Caption: that

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:45.199
Caption: shot that slide was um

01:42:42.639 --> 01:42:48.560
Caption: across wa um you actually tend to find

01:42:45.199 --> 01:42:50.719
Caption: you get better performance in some

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:52.080
Caption: rural but not very rural town so i think

01:42:50.719 --> 01:42:53.119
Caption: that might have been something like cal

01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:56.560
Caption: barry

01:42:53.119 --> 01:42:58.560
Caption: they&#39;ve got a tower there it serves uh

01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:00.479
Caption: comparatively less people than it does

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:02.000
Caption: in perth so some perth suburbs mostly

01:43:00.479 --> 01:43:03.919
Caption: sort of sit around the middle there and

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.159
Caption: then very rural places will have those

01:43:03.919 --> 01:43:06.158
Caption: lower

01:43:08.839 --> 01:43:13.759
Caption: scores awesome talk man i love the uh

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.279
Caption: sponsor comparison

01:43:13.759 --> 01:43:17.839
Caption: um

01:43:15.279 --> 01:43:20.959
Caption: we also at my company were using the

01:43:17.839 --> 01:43:23.279
Caption: google library to send the analytics to

01:43:20.959 --> 01:43:24.959
Caption: in our case new relic

01:43:23.279 --> 01:43:26.319
Caption: and new relic also

01:43:24.959 --> 01:43:28.238
Caption: monitored that through their own

01:43:26.319 --> 01:43:29.359
Caption: mechanism and we found that the numbers

01:43:28.238 --> 01:43:31.599
Caption: were different

01:43:29.359 --> 01:43:34.560
Caption: and i just wondered if you&#39;d come across

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:37.280
Caption: different values for the core web vitals

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:39.919
Caption: with different tooling

01:43:37.279 --> 01:43:42.959
Caption: that&#39;s really interesting um

01:43:39.919 --> 01:43:45.040
Caption: yeah i they they vary a lot and like um

01:43:42.959 --> 01:43:46.399
Caption: uh if you just run two

01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:47.760
Caption: google lighthouse

01:43:46.399 --> 01:43:50.399
Caption: scores back to back you&#39;re not going to

01:43:47.759 --> 01:43:51.919
Caption: get the same results as well um

01:43:50.399 --> 01:43:53.919
Caption: but yeah even if we&#39;re kind of looking

01:43:51.919 --> 01:43:55.439
Caption: at exactly the same data i&#39;m not sure

01:43:53.919 --> 01:43:57.279
Caption: the difference there the one thing i

01:43:55.439 --> 01:44:00.319
Caption: could probably say is maybe

01:43:57.279 --> 01:44:02.158
Caption: that web vitals library um it has to run

01:44:00.319 --> 01:44:04.799
Caption: sort of in javascript space javascript

01:44:02.159 --> 01:44:06.400
Caption: runtime whereas um the one that&#39;s built

01:44:04.799 --> 01:44:07.759
Caption: into google chrome as much as they try

01:44:06.399 --> 01:44:09.359
Caption: and keep that the same maybe they can

01:44:07.759 --> 01:44:10.559
Caption: kind of detect different things in in

01:44:09.359 --> 01:44:12.238
Caption: the browser and they come up with

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:14.080
Caption: different scores i&#39;d imagine they keep

01:44:12.238 --> 01:44:14.879
Caption: it as close as they possibly can

01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:16.719
Caption: um

01:44:14.879 --> 01:44:18.718
Caption: but yeah that&#39;s some sort of variability

01:44:16.719 --> 01:44:21.360
Caption: in there how how much different was it

01:44:18.719 --> 01:44:24.560
Caption: out for you

01:44:21.359 --> 01:44:26.718
Caption: it was uh mostly around the cls scores

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:29.600
Caption: so like the new relic one was very

01:44:26.719 --> 01:44:31.600
Caption: positive but the google one was a bit it

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:32.479
Caption: felt more realistic so we sort of

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:34.239
Caption: trusted

01:44:32.479 --> 01:44:36.319
Caption: the google javascript library more than

01:44:34.238 --> 01:44:38.479
Caption: you relics at the time

01:44:36.319 --> 01:44:40.479
Caption: yeah okay that&#39;s interesting um

01:44:38.479 --> 01:44:41.839
Caption: i i don&#39;t know how knew i could put that

01:44:40.479 --> 01:44:44.879
Caption: together as well i imagine there&#39;s a

01:44:41.839 --> 01:44:47.118
Caption: guide for how to put it together maybe

01:44:44.879 --> 01:44:48.399
Caption: um i know that that web vitals library

01:44:47.119 --> 01:44:50.239
Caption: is largely

01:44:48.399 --> 01:44:52.399
Caption: something that supports chrome more than

01:44:50.238 --> 01:44:54.158
Caption: other browsers maybe new relic went and

01:44:52.399 --> 01:44:56.959
Caption: rewrote it themselves and figured out

01:44:54.159 --> 01:44:59.520
Caption: how to get it to work in webkit and and

01:44:56.959 --> 01:45:00.799
Caption: firefox i can&#39;t speculate on that but um

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.839
Caption: there could actually be different codes

01:45:00.799 --> 01:45:03.839
Caption: sort of detecting that

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:07.760
Caption: thank you so much macklin if everyone

01:45:06.399 --> 01:45:11.839
Caption: can just give him another round of

01:45:07.759 --> 01:45:11.839
Caption: approvals for that amazing call

01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:18.080
Caption: and it&#39;s now time for changeover if you

01:45:15.759 --> 01:45:20.479

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:39.199
Caption: like to use observer can do that yeah

01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:40.879
Caption: but it needs to be secure we can&#39;t have

01:50:39.199 --> 01:50:42.239
Caption: our app compromised by breaches not a

01:50:40.879 --> 01:50:43.600

01:50:42.238 --> 01:50:45.599

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:47.140

Caption: right um

01:59:52.238 --> 01:59:55.678
Caption: i&#39;ve got to say i&#39;m a bit concerned

01:59:53.759 --> 01:59:57.118
Caption: about this because you know in an agile

01:59:55.679 --> 01:59:59.840

01:59:59.839 --> 02:00:04.560
Caption: um but anyway um you mentioned a

02:00:02.639 --> 02:00:06.479
Caption: previous incarnation what happened with

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:08.719

02:00:06.479 --> 02:00:10.000
Caption: well it was a new technology the it team

02:00:08.719 --> 02:00:11.760
Caption: didn&#39;t know what they were doing it

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:13.199

02:00:11.759 --> 02:00:14.638
Caption: of cancelled it

02:00:13.199 --> 02:00:16.320
Caption: i also don&#39;t think the project manager

02:00:14.639 --> 02:00:18.639
Caption: was very good

02:00:16.319 --> 02:00:20.060

Caption: talking to the business if i can because

02:00:29.279 --> 02:00:33.118
Caption: this this project&#39;s actually going to

02:00:30.959 --> 02:00:35.040

Caption: you tell me who i should talk to

02:00:36.879 --> 02:00:41.198
Caption: there&#39;s no need to talk to the business

02:00:38.799 --> 02:00:43.040
Caption: the it team know exactly what we need

02:00:41.199 --> 02:00:44.800
Caption: this is a like for like replacement of

02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:47.839
Caption: our current system so we have all the

02:00:44.799 --> 02:00:47.839
Caption: requirements laid out

02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:54.080
Caption: oh dear this is going to be good

02:00:51.679 --> 02:00:56.080

Caption: business because you know there&#39;s going

02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:00.719
Caption: to be a huge change impact here um do we

02:00:59.119 --> 02:01:02.800
Caption: at least have an internal change

02:01:00.719 --> 02:01:04.960
Caption: management team that i can leverage

02:01:02.799 --> 02:01:06.799
Caption: we&#39;ve got a corporate comms team and

02:01:04.959 --> 02:01:09.119
Caption: they can manage most of that and for

02:01:06.799 --> 02:01:11.359
Caption: anything else i&#39;m sure you can handle it

02:01:09.119 --> 02:01:13.119
Caption: anyway i&#39;ve got a meeting to run too

02:01:11.359 --> 02:01:16.678

Caption: [Applause]

02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:26.320
Caption: p.s trent would never say any of those

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.560
Caption: things he actually he actually heads up

02:01:26.319 --> 02:01:30.479
Caption: our design crew so you know business

02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:33.359

02:01:30.479 --> 02:01:33.359
Caption: things are pretty important

02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:36.959
Caption: so

02:01:34.879 --> 02:01:38.718
Caption: is this project destined to become

02:01:36.959 --> 02:01:40.639
Caption: project insanity

02:01:38.719 --> 02:01:43.920
Caption: if it could go wrong it will go wrong in

02:01:40.639 --> 02:01:45.679
Caption: this there is so many things that are

02:01:43.919 --> 02:01:47.119
Caption: big red flags

02:01:45.679 --> 02:01:48.479
Caption: now in fairness it&#39;s unlikely that

02:01:47.119 --> 02:01:51.280
Caption: you&#39;re going to walk into a project

02:01:48.479 --> 02:01:53.040
Caption: which has all of them but i&#39;m sure every

02:01:51.279 --> 02:01:55.759
Caption: single one of us in this room has

02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:58.479
Caption: experienced many of those particular

02:01:55.759 --> 02:02:00.879
Caption: scenarios before

02:01:58.479 --> 02:02:02.560
Caption: so the reality is though there&#39;s a few

02:02:00.879 --> 02:02:04.479
Caption: themes that come out

02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:06.159
Caption: when you actually look at it so whilst

02:02:04.479 --> 02:02:08.799
Caption: there was a lot of things that we raised

02:02:06.159 --> 02:02:10.400
Caption: there there were some key themes that we

02:02:08.799 --> 02:02:12.799
Caption: talked about

02:02:10.399 --> 02:02:14.638
Caption: so the first one&#39;s actually around

02:02:12.799 --> 02:02:16.959
Caption: funding so

02:02:14.639 --> 02:02:20.560
Caption: there&#39;s no business case for this it&#39;s

02:02:16.959 --> 02:02:22.718
Caption: part of the legacy replacement fund

02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:25.919
Caption: so what we&#39;ve got money to actually

02:02:22.719 --> 02:02:27.760
Caption: change a system but we&#39;ve got no money

02:02:25.919 --> 02:02:29.678
Caption: for anything else

02:02:27.759 --> 02:02:31.519
Caption: nothing else on me i&#39;m the project

02:02:29.679 --> 02:02:33.119
Caption: manager i&#39;m i&#39;m funded

02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:34.159
Caption: you know but what about the rest of the

02:02:33.119 --> 02:02:36.399
Caption: team

02:02:34.159 --> 02:02:38.000
Caption: there&#39;s no funding for additional

02:02:36.399 --> 02:02:39.599
Caption: resources we&#39;re going to need some

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.599
Caption: change management on this we&#39;re

02:02:39.599 --> 02:02:43.919
Caption: replacing a legacy system with something

02:02:41.599 --> 02:02:46.080
Caption: new how can we manage without some

02:02:43.919 --> 02:02:48.000
Caption: change management it is going to impact

02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:49.679
Caption: the business

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.839
Caption: and there&#39;s no budget allocated for the

02:02:49.679 --> 02:02:53.199
Caption: internal resources either so if you

02:02:51.839 --> 02:02:56.000
Caption: think about it we&#39;re going to use the

02:02:53.199 --> 02:02:58.159
Caption: bau resources fantastic

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.959
Caption: but they&#39;ve got a day job

02:02:58.159 --> 02:03:02.880
Caption: and given that they have a day job

02:03:00.959 --> 02:03:04.959
Caption: somebody&#39;s still got to do it that job

02:03:02.879 --> 02:03:06.319
Caption: doesn&#39;t go away so if we want to use

02:03:04.959 --> 02:03:08.080
Caption: those people then they&#39;re going to need

02:03:06.319 --> 02:03:09.359
Caption: to be back filled so we need some money

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.399
Caption: for it

02:03:09.359 --> 02:03:12.839
Caption: so

02:03:10.399 --> 02:03:15.439
Caption: but money budget in this particular

02:03:12.839 --> 02:03:17.598
Caption: scenario the next one&#39;s resourcing so

02:03:15.439 --> 02:03:20.159
Caption: resourcing generally is a big issue on

02:03:17.599 --> 02:03:21.599
Caption: this one we&#39;ve got a product owner good

02:03:20.159 --> 02:03:23.679
Caption: news

02:03:21.599 --> 02:03:26.879
Caption: he doesn&#39;t really he&#39;s not a product

02:03:23.679 --> 02:03:29.840
Caption: owner he&#39;s a great guy clearly he knows

02:03:26.879 --> 02:03:32.000
Caption: stuff he&#39;s only allocated 50 of the time

02:03:29.839 --> 02:03:34.080
Caption: but he can&#39;t make any decisions

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.399
Caption: so how good a product owner is he going

02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:36.399
Caption: to be

02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:40.159
Caption: the resources don&#39;t even know this is

02:03:38.719 --> 02:03:42.239
Caption: coming yet

02:03:40.159 --> 02:03:43.520
Caption: so yeah we&#39;re going to use the i.t team

02:03:42.238 --> 02:03:45.198
Caption: i&#39;ve just got to go talk to their

02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:46.479
Caption: managers and get them on board that&#39;s

02:03:45.199 --> 02:03:49.199
Caption: going to be easy

02:03:46.479 --> 02:03:49.199
Caption: yeah right

02:03:50.399 --> 02:03:55.599
Caption: and they&#39;re only part-time

02:03:53.599 --> 02:03:58.639
Caption: when you have resources who are only

02:03:55.599 --> 02:04:02.959
Caption: part-time dedicated to a project

02:03:58.639 --> 02:04:05.040
Caption: it&#39;s always a sign of potential issue

02:04:02.959 --> 02:04:07.520
Caption: and the reason i say that is because if

02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:08.879
Caption: they&#39;ve got a bau responsibility on one

02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:11.040
Caption: side of the fence and they&#39;ve got a

02:04:08.879 --> 02:04:12.319
Caption: project responsibility on another side

02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:15.280
Caption: of the fence

02:04:12.319 --> 02:04:18.959
Caption: when they are trying when there&#39;s a fire

02:04:15.279 --> 02:04:21.198
Caption: in bau land guess what takes priority

02:04:18.959 --> 02:04:25.839
Caption: every time they will go back to their

02:04:21.199 --> 02:04:25.840
Caption: bau work and your project will suffer

02:04:26.639 --> 02:04:31.760
Caption: so the next theme is around decision

02:04:28.719 --> 02:04:34.239
Caption: making we&#39;ve got a committee yay

02:04:31.759 --> 02:04:37.279
Caption: once a month we can get a decision

02:04:34.238 --> 02:04:39.519
Caption: they want this to be agile hello this is

02:04:37.279 --> 02:04:40.959
Caption: not going to happen right

02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:42.239
Caption: once a month

02:04:40.959 --> 02:04:43.839
Caption: board decision

02:04:42.238 --> 02:04:45.759
Caption: and what&#39;s worse we all know that with

02:04:43.839 --> 02:04:47.759
Caption: committees invariably they don&#39;t make a

02:04:45.759 --> 02:04:50.079
Caption: decision straight away

02:04:47.759 --> 02:04:54.158
Caption: so it might be two months before you can

02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:54.159
Caption: even get a decision all three even worse

02:04:54.238 --> 02:04:57.678
Caption: and like i said before the product owner

02:04:56.560 --> 02:05:00.000
Caption: is just not

02:04:57.679 --> 02:05:01.760
Caption: senior enough to make decisions he&#39;s not

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.319
Caption: a decision maker he&#39;s not somebody that

02:05:01.759 --> 02:05:05.919
Caption: the organization will respect and agree

02:05:04.319 --> 02:05:06.959
Caption: to his decisions there needs to be

02:05:05.919 --> 02:05:09.678
Caption: somebody

02:05:06.959 --> 02:05:10.639
Caption: at a very senior level who other people

02:05:09.679 --> 02:05:14.479
Caption: will

02:05:10.639 --> 02:05:14.479
Caption: adhere to the decisions that they made

02:05:14.799 --> 02:05:19.520
Caption: business engagement

02:05:16.879 --> 02:05:21.520
Caption: no need to engage the business i i.t

02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:23.520
Caption: know what they want

02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:26.719
Caption: gotta love it how many times have you

02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:28.560
Caption: heard that the i.t team know exactly

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:30.480
Caption: what the business wants

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:33.359
Caption: how can they

02:05:30.479 --> 02:05:35.599
Caption: sure they may know some of the things

02:05:33.359 --> 02:05:37.198
Caption: that are wrong with the existing systems

02:05:35.599 --> 02:05:38.719
Caption: and they know some of the gripes that

02:05:37.199 --> 02:05:41.119
Caption: come out of the business but they don&#39;t

02:05:38.719 --> 02:05:43.360
Caption: know everybody&#39;s job and all the things

02:05:41.119 --> 02:05:45.119
Caption: that they do in their day-to-day job

02:05:43.359 --> 02:05:46.959
Caption: they don&#39;t know the things that drive

02:05:45.119 --> 02:05:48.639
Caption: those people insane

02:05:46.959 --> 02:05:50.000
Caption: because of what they have to do with the

02:05:48.639 --> 02:05:51.599
Caption: systems they&#39;re doing they don&#39;t know

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.919
Caption: the processes

02:05:51.599 --> 02:05:56.159
Caption: they do not know what the requirements

02:05:53.919 --> 02:05:56.158
Caption: are

02:05:56.719 --> 02:06:00.639
Caption: no ux

02:05:58.319 --> 02:06:03.520
Caption: gotta love this one

02:06:00.639 --> 02:06:05.760
Caption: as trent actually said recently there&#39;s

02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:08.239
Caption: no such thing as no ux

02:06:05.759 --> 02:06:11.839
Caption: if you&#39;ve got people involved and a

02:06:08.238 --> 02:06:14.479
Caption: system there is a user experience

02:06:11.839 --> 02:06:17.598
Caption: if you don&#39;t design for it it will be a

02:06:14.479 --> 02:06:19.679
Caption: bad experience you need to design for it

02:06:17.599 --> 02:06:22.399
Caption: to make sure that it&#39;s a good user

02:06:19.679 --> 02:06:22.400
Caption: experience

02:06:22.719 --> 02:06:26.400
Caption: no change management yay we&#39;ve got a

02:06:25.119 --> 02:06:28.320
Caption: comms team

02:06:26.399 --> 02:06:29.599
Caption: so good they can send out some emails

02:06:28.319 --> 02:06:32.879
Caption: and they can put something up on their

02:06:29.599 --> 02:06:35.280
Caption: internet that&#39;s going to be really cool

02:06:32.879 --> 02:06:37.279
Caption: but that&#39;s not change management

02:06:35.279 --> 02:06:39.839
Caption: change management involves bringing

02:06:37.279 --> 02:06:41.439
Caption: people along the journey so that when

02:06:39.839 --> 02:06:44.158
Caption: they get to the end

02:06:41.439 --> 02:06:46.079
Caption: they embrace whatever it is whatever

02:06:44.159 --> 02:06:48.400
Caption: technology it is that you&#39;re trying to

02:06:46.079 --> 02:06:48.399
Caption: put in

02:06:48.479 --> 02:06:52.238
Caption: like i said corporate comms are not

02:06:50.399 --> 02:06:53.839
Caption: change managers

02:06:52.238 --> 02:06:55.118
Caption: and they&#39;ve got a very busy workload

02:06:53.839 --> 02:06:57.279
Caption: anyway so they&#39;re not going to be able

02:06:55.119 --> 02:07:00.159
Caption: to do very much

02:06:57.279 --> 02:07:02.638
Caption: and then the final bit

02:07:00.159 --> 02:07:05.599
Caption: agile they&#39;ve got no idea what agile is

02:07:02.639 --> 02:07:07.040
Caption: this is going to be an agile project yay

02:07:05.599 --> 02:07:08.879
Caption: if you&#39;re going to try and run an agile

02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:10.959
Caption: project for an organization that&#39;s never

02:07:08.879 --> 02:07:13.198
Caption: done agile before you&#39;re going to spend

02:07:10.959 --> 02:07:14.959
Caption: an awful lot of time in coaching and

02:07:13.199 --> 02:07:16.800
Caption: training just to bring them along that

02:07:14.959 --> 02:07:18.479
Caption: journey which is going to eat into the

02:07:16.799 --> 02:07:19.919
Caption: time for the project

02:07:18.479 --> 02:07:22.159
Caption: so in this particular case the

02:07:19.919 --> 02:07:23.520
Caption: organization is very immature they don&#39;t

02:07:22.159 --> 02:07:24.560
Caption: know what they&#39;re letting themselves in

02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:28.000
Caption: for they don&#39;t even know what they&#39;ve

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:29.919
Caption: asked for and out of the box how many

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:31.359
Caption: times have you heard this it&#39;s out of

02:07:29.919 --> 02:07:33.759
Caption: the box

02:07:31.359 --> 02:07:35.439
Caption: no because customization it&#39;s just

02:07:33.759 --> 02:07:38.158
Caption: configuration and that&#39;s why we don&#39;t

02:07:35.439 --> 02:07:41.119
Caption: need to talk to the users hello have you

02:07:38.159 --> 02:07:43.119
Caption: ever seen a legacy system replaced by

02:07:41.119 --> 02:07:45.760
Caption: something off the shelf that&#39;s exactly

02:07:43.119 --> 02:07:48.159
Caption: the same that follows exactly the same

02:07:45.759 --> 02:07:50.399
Caption: processes as the previous one

02:07:48.159 --> 02:07:52.800
Caption: and why would you do that anyway

02:07:50.399 --> 02:07:54.399
Caption: because the reason for changing is to

02:07:52.799 --> 02:07:57.279
Caption: improve things

02:07:54.399 --> 02:07:58.959
Caption: so either you&#39;re going to have to do a

02:07:57.279 --> 02:08:01.198
Caption: lot of change management around

02:07:58.959 --> 02:08:03.520
Caption: processes and organizations and how

02:08:01.199 --> 02:08:05.360
Caption: people work or you&#39;re going to have to

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:07.919
Caption: customize the heck out of this piece of

02:08:05.359 --> 02:08:10.238
Caption: software in order to make it feel like

02:08:07.919 --> 02:08:12.158
Caption: the one they had before

02:08:10.238 --> 02:08:13.759
Caption: and it&#39;s always configuration and how do

02:08:12.159 --> 02:08:14.959
Caption: you configure it unless you talk to the

02:08:13.759 --> 02:08:18.559
Caption: business

02:08:14.959 --> 02:08:19.839
Caption: you don&#39;t know what to configure it with

02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:23.359
Caption: so

02:08:19.839 --> 02:08:25.118
Caption: lots and lots of red flags in here

02:08:23.359 --> 02:08:28.238
Caption: it&#39;s no wonder the last one failed if

02:08:25.119 --> 02:08:31.679
Caption: they followed the same premise last time

02:08:28.238 --> 02:08:34.158
Caption: it was never going to succeed

02:08:31.679 --> 02:08:36.159
Caption: so what can we do about it

02:08:34.159 --> 02:08:38.639
Caption: as the project manager on this there are

02:08:36.159 --> 02:08:40.719
Caption: a number of things that i can do

02:08:38.639 --> 02:08:42.239
Caption: um whoa when my pictures have all gone

02:08:40.719 --> 02:08:43.840
Caption: there we go there are a number of things

02:08:42.238 --> 02:08:45.519
Caption: that i can do

02:08:43.839 --> 02:08:48.560
Caption: the first one

02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:51.439
Caption: is actually to do

02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:55.599
Caption: to define what success is

02:08:51.439 --> 02:09:00.479
Caption: right at the moment success is replace

02:08:55.599 --> 02:09:02.560
Caption: xyz legacy system with project insanity

02:09:00.479 --> 02:09:04.159
Caption: and all will be well

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:06.719
Caption: replacement of a system is not a

02:09:04.159 --> 02:09:09.599
Caption: definition of success

02:09:06.719 --> 02:09:11.280
Caption: for success to happen it&#39;s got to be

02:09:09.599 --> 02:09:14.639
Caption: measurable

02:09:11.279 --> 02:09:17.439
Caption: so this is the success maybe

02:09:14.639 --> 02:09:21.040
Caption: people are now more efficient

02:09:17.439 --> 02:09:23.919
Caption: that the organization makes more money

02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:26.079
Caption: that we can do more with less

02:09:23.919 --> 02:09:27.439
Caption: whatever it is but it has to be

02:09:26.079 --> 02:09:29.760
Caption: measurable

02:09:27.439 --> 02:09:32.560
Caption: replacing a legacy system with something

02:09:29.759 --> 02:09:34.799
Caption: new is not a definition of success

02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:37.199
Caption: and in this scenario sure you can go and

02:09:34.799 --> 02:09:39.118
Caption: create something new but it won&#39;t work

02:09:37.199 --> 02:09:41.199
Caption: it won&#39;t be successful

02:09:39.119 --> 02:09:43.119
Caption: because the people aren&#39;t involved

02:09:41.199 --> 02:09:46.639
Caption: because the organization doesn&#39;t know

02:09:43.119 --> 02:09:49.760
Caption: what they&#39;re getting into

02:09:46.639 --> 02:09:50.880
Caption: next thing project management 101 have a

02:09:49.759 --> 02:09:54.959
Caption: plan

02:09:50.879 --> 02:09:57.439
Caption: we all know the old adage plan

02:09:54.959 --> 02:10:00.718
Caption: failed to plan and you plan to fail

02:09:57.439 --> 02:10:03.198
Caption: in this scenario that is so true

02:10:00.719 --> 02:10:04.560
Caption: the plan will need to be really really

02:10:03.199 --> 02:10:06.560
Caption: robust

02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:08.719
Caption: and the schedule needs to encompass

02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:10.800
Caption: everything that you know needs to happen

02:10:08.719 --> 02:10:14.800
Caption: not just what they think needs to happen

02:10:10.799 --> 02:10:15.839
Caption: but what you know needs to happen

02:10:14.799 --> 02:10:18.158
Caption: and then

02:10:15.839 --> 02:10:20.718
Caption: once you&#39;ve done that and this is the

02:10:18.159 --> 02:10:23.280
Caption: most critical step

02:10:20.719 --> 02:10:25.760
Caption: is to actually run a risk workshop with

02:10:23.279 --> 02:10:27.678
Caption: all the key stakeholders

02:10:25.759 --> 02:10:30.638
Caption: you need to get them in a room

02:10:27.679 --> 02:10:33.119
Caption: and help them to identify all the risks

02:10:30.639 --> 02:10:35.040
Caption: and you need to be very very

02:10:33.119 --> 02:10:38.560
Caption: granular so we can&#39;t have a risk that

02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:41.359
Caption: says resources aren&#39;t available

02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:45.040
Caption: the risk has to be we can&#39;t get the

02:10:41.359 --> 02:10:49.118
Caption: resources from finance when we need them

02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:54.079
Caption: to be able to do whatever it is or the

02:10:49.119 --> 02:10:56.560
Caption: bau it resources get pulled off onto bau

02:10:54.079 --> 02:10:58.159
Caption: activities and off the project all of

02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:00.159
Caption: those are different risks and you need a

02:10:58.159 --> 02:11:01.199
Caption: different risk for every single resource

02:11:00.159 --> 02:11:03.040
Caption: issue

02:11:01.199 --> 02:11:05.679
Caption: and the reason you need a different risk

02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:08.319
Caption: is is that you then need to get an owner

02:11:05.679 --> 02:11:10.479
Caption: for all of those risks so the owner for

02:11:08.319 --> 02:11:12.879
Caption: the one about the finance people would

02:11:10.479 --> 02:11:15.279
Caption: be the finance manager the owner for the

02:11:12.879 --> 02:11:16.879
Caption: one about the it people would be the it

02:11:15.279 --> 02:11:18.479
Caption: manager

02:11:16.879 --> 02:11:20.799
Caption: and then

02:11:18.479 --> 02:11:22.879
Caption: more important still they have to take

02:11:20.799 --> 02:11:25.839
Caption: some action to make sure that it is

02:11:22.879 --> 02:11:28.799
Caption: mitigated so define the risks identify

02:11:25.839 --> 02:11:31.118
Caption: the mitigation and the owner and then

02:11:28.799 --> 02:11:33.198
Caption: make it happen

02:11:31.119 --> 02:11:34.959
Caption: and then you can come up with a budget

02:11:33.199 --> 02:11:36.880
Caption: because we&#39;ve just doubled the cost of

02:11:34.959 --> 02:11:38.319
Caption: this project

02:11:36.879 --> 02:11:40.238
Caption: with the schedule that i would have come

02:11:38.319 --> 02:11:41.598
Caption: up with in this particular scenario at

02:11:40.238 --> 02:11:43.839
Caption: least

02:11:41.599 --> 02:11:45.439
Caption: in order to make it work agree the

02:11:43.839 --> 02:11:47.759
Caption: budget if you can&#39;t get agreement on the

02:11:45.439 --> 02:11:50.718
Caption: budget which includes backfilling your

02:11:47.759 --> 02:11:53.598
Caption: bau resources or whatever it is

02:11:50.719 --> 02:11:56.320
Caption: great time to walk away

02:11:53.599 --> 02:11:57.439
Caption: because it won&#39;t succeed it will go over

02:11:56.319 --> 02:11:59.839
Caption: budget and then everyone will be

02:11:57.439 --> 02:12:01.759
Caption: screaming at you

02:11:59.839 --> 02:12:03.279
Caption: and and bear in mind i&#39;m taking this

02:12:01.759 --> 02:12:05.439
Caption: from the perspective of a project

02:12:03.279 --> 02:12:08.158
Caption: manager but even as a team member on the

02:12:05.439 --> 02:12:10.238
Caption: team you can help identify those risks

02:12:08.159 --> 02:12:11.679
Caption: and help to work to mitigate those risks

02:12:10.238 --> 02:12:13.359
Caption: and to

02:12:11.679 --> 02:12:14.719
Caption: you know take ownership of some of those

02:12:13.359 --> 02:12:17.439
Caption: risks so it&#39;s not just the project

02:12:14.719 --> 02:12:18.960
Caption: manager and the project manager cannot

02:12:17.439 --> 02:12:20.479
Caption: own the risks

02:12:18.959 --> 02:12:22.319
Caption: they must be owned by someone who could

02:12:20.479 --> 02:12:24.799
Caption: do something about it so i&#39;ve seen

02:12:22.319 --> 02:12:26.158
Caption: project risk schedules this big the

02:12:24.799 --> 02:12:29.598
Caption: owner of all of them is the project

02:12:26.159 --> 02:12:29.599
Caption: manager still won&#39;t work

02:12:30.079 --> 02:12:33.919
Caption: and there&#39;s a whole load of others which

02:12:31.599 --> 02:12:34.719
Caption: i don&#39;t really have time to do deal with

02:12:33.919 --> 02:12:37.359
Caption: but

02:12:34.719 --> 02:12:39.599
Caption: you know agree ways of working engage

02:12:37.359 --> 02:12:41.678
Caption: the business you got to talk to them

02:12:39.599 --> 02:12:45.919
Caption: demonstrate bad ux and get the people

02:12:41.679 --> 02:12:45.920
Caption: who who are on side to see it

02:12:46.159 --> 02:12:50.880
Caption: so i&#39;ll leave you with two things the

02:12:48.079 --> 02:12:52.639
Caption: first is is that i.t projects

02:12:50.879 --> 02:12:55.839
Caption: rarely fail

02:12:52.639 --> 02:12:58.639
Caption: because of the technology

02:12:55.839 --> 02:13:01.118
Caption: i.t projects generally fail because of

02:12:58.639 --> 02:13:03.520
Caption: all of the things around it

02:13:01.119 --> 02:13:04.719
Caption: it&#39;s the people and process

02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:07.199
Caption: and money

02:13:04.719 --> 02:13:08.560
Caption: aspects that make it fail so we&#39;re

02:13:07.199 --> 02:13:10.239
Caption: talking people we&#39;re talking the

02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:12.479
Caption: resourcing we&#39;re talking the business

02:13:10.238 --> 02:13:15.118
Caption: engagement money&#39;s obvious the funding

02:13:12.479 --> 02:13:16.959
Caption: one and the process how decisions are

02:13:15.119 --> 02:13:19.360
Caption: made how you&#39;re going to work on the

02:13:16.959 --> 02:13:21.040
Caption: project if you don&#39;t get all of those

02:13:19.359 --> 02:13:22.799
Caption: things right

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:25.679
Caption: that&#39;s what will cause the project to

02:13:22.799 --> 02:13:26.959
Caption: fail not the lack of the technology to

02:13:25.679 --> 02:13:28.560
Caption: do its job

02:13:26.959 --> 02:13:30.639
Caption: because we&#39;ve got some really really

02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:33.119
Caption: clever technical folk out here who can

02:13:30.639 --> 02:13:36.000
Caption: make it work and they&#39;ll always overcome

02:13:33.119 --> 02:13:36.000
Caption: those challenges

02:13:36.879 --> 02:13:42.079
Caption: and at the end of the day the

02:13:38.639 --> 02:13:45.280
Caption: stakeholders need to acknowledge

02:13:42.079 --> 02:13:49.040
Caption: that the is there are risks

02:13:45.279 --> 02:13:50.319
Caption: they need to accept ownership for those

02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:54.399
Caption: risks

02:13:50.319 --> 02:13:56.959
Caption: and then they need to action those risks

02:13:54.399 --> 02:13:58.799
Caption: and if you can get them to do all that

02:13:56.959 --> 02:14:01.520
Caption: you&#39;ve got the best possible chance of

02:13:58.799 --> 02:14:04.078
Caption: success in this scenario you still might

02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:07.040
Caption: not you still might fail but it&#39;ll give

02:14:04.079 --> 02:14:08.750
Caption: you the best possible chance of success

02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:16.479
Caption: thank you

02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:18.959

Caption: um i know that i&#39;ve definitely learned a

02:14:20.879 --> 02:14:25.359
Caption: few things i&#39;ll be on the lookout in the

02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:28.560
Caption: next project that i&#39;m joining in

02:14:25.359 --> 02:14:32.000
Caption: hopefully not quite as many red flags

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:34.479
Caption: um so we&#39;re ready for the change of the

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.520

02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:24.959

02:21:24.959 --> 02:21:28.589

Caption: so i&#39;m going to be talking about

02:26:23.359 --> 02:26:28.479
Caption: superhero layouts uh

02:26:26.799 --> 02:26:31.599
Caption: comics are said to have passed through

02:26:28.478 --> 02:26:35.039
Caption: four ages with each of the ages known to

02:26:31.599 --> 02:26:36.398
Caption: have something distinctive about it

02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:38.479
Caption: in the golden age we were first

02:26:36.399 --> 02:26:42.560
Caption: introduced to the superhero archetype

02:26:38.478 --> 02:26:44.879
Caption: this was around about 1938 or so

02:26:42.559 --> 02:26:48.719
Caption: this was our introduction to characters

02:26:44.879 --> 02:26:50.398
Caption: like superman wonder woman and batman

02:26:48.719 --> 02:26:53.200
Caption: during the silver age the world is

02:26:50.399 --> 02:26:55.760
Caption: recovering from a world war and readers

02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:58.080
Caption: had matured during that time so to meet

02:26:55.759 --> 02:27:00.478
Caption: that maturity the stories were focused

02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:02.560
Caption: on horror crime and romance more than

02:27:00.478 --> 02:27:04.398
Caption: what they were before

02:27:02.559 --> 02:27:06.000
Caption: this sort of helped the industry to

02:27:04.399 --> 02:27:08.160
Caption: survive through what was a difficult

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.080
Caption: period

02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:11.759
Caption: after the silver age many of those

02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:12.959
Caption: heroic story lines that the writers

02:27:11.759 --> 02:27:15.358
Caption: could think of

02:27:12.959 --> 02:27:18.160
Caption: were used so they decided instead the

02:27:15.359 --> 02:27:20.640
Caption: fruit of bronze age to tackle the social

02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:24.799
Caption: issues of the day this would include

02:27:20.639 --> 02:27:27.759
Caption: bigotry racism and substance abuse

02:27:24.799 --> 02:27:30.959
Caption: and the modern age is a time of redesign

02:27:27.759 --> 02:27:33.279
Caption: growth and some disruption by the web

02:27:30.959 --> 02:27:35.359
Caption: anyone can publish now bringing

02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:37.520
Caption: more unique stories and making comics

02:27:35.359 --> 02:27:39.280
Caption: more accessible than to audiences than

02:27:37.519 --> 02:27:41.119
Caption: ever thought possible

02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:43.600
Caption: no longer was it about a couple of those

02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:46.080
Caption: major players that were creating or

02:27:43.599 --> 02:27:48.318
Caption: publishing comics

02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:50.319
Caption: and so what makes comics an absorbing

02:27:48.319 --> 02:27:52.800
Caption: storytelling medium is that along with

02:27:50.319 --> 02:27:54.720
Caption: great characters stories and art styles

02:27:52.799 --> 02:27:56.799
Caption: is the impact that the layout can have

02:27:54.719 --> 02:27:58.239
Caption: on that story

02:27:56.799 --> 02:28:01.519
Caption: and we&#39;re going to explore each of the

02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:03.839
Caption: ages of comics and how it relates to web

02:28:01.519 --> 02:28:05.919
Caption: layout and how css grid combined with

02:28:03.839 --> 02:28:09.280
Caption: some other css techniques

02:28:05.919 --> 02:28:10.000
Caption: can be used to recreate these layouts

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:11.120
Caption: and

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:13.839
Caption: as you&#39;re looking at these they&#39;re

02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:15.679
Caption: obviously very comic book focused but

02:28:13.839 --> 02:28:17.280
Caption: think about how you can reimagine the

02:28:15.679 --> 02:28:19.519
Caption: techniques that i&#39;m talking about here

02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:21.359
Caption: for the use in your layouts and projects

02:28:19.519 --> 02:28:23.039
Caption: that you&#39;re working on

02:28:21.359 --> 02:28:24.560
Caption: and i&#39;m not going to dive too much into

02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:26.479
Caption: responsiveness i think there&#39;s a lot of

02:28:24.559 --> 02:28:27.759
Caption: great articles that cover that with grid

02:28:26.478 --> 02:28:29.599
Caption: already

02:28:27.759 --> 02:28:32.160
Caption: but it is possible to do so and there&#39;s

02:28:29.599 --> 02:28:33.438
Caption: a short part here where i will

02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:35.200
Caption: cover it so

02:28:33.439 --> 02:28:38.640
Caption: those comic book ages that i went

02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:41.040
Caption: through spanned about 70 years and

02:28:38.639 --> 02:28:43.759
Caption: 70 years is a fairly long time to be

02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:46.160
Caption: able to evolve a storytelling medium

02:28:43.759 --> 02:28:49.438
Caption: by comparison our industry the web is

02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:54.240
Caption: still relatively young html is about 29

02:28:49.439 --> 02:28:57.040
Caption: years old and css is 25 and that makes

02:28:54.240 --> 02:29:00.479
Caption: me older than both of them unfortunately

02:28:57.040 --> 02:29:02.879
Caption: not combined but that&#39;s still okay

02:29:00.478 --> 02:29:06.478
Caption: so the web is after all young and so if

02:29:02.879 --> 02:29:08.240
Caption: anyone else is older than them so are we

02:29:06.478 --> 02:29:10.159
Caption: but the point i&#39;m getting at to here is

02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:12.240
Caption: in a relatively short period of time

02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:14.719
Caption: layout on the web progressed through

02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:18.560
Caption: many ages of its own we started off with

02:29:14.719 --> 02:29:20.160
Caption: just html this was the text links basic

02:29:18.559 --> 02:29:22.639
Caption: elements

02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:24.000
Caption: we sort of co-opted tables to do what

02:29:22.639 --> 02:29:26.239
Caption: they weren&#39;t really meant to do and we

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.399
Caption: started using them for layouts

02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:31.280
Caption: the first of our comic book crossovers

02:29:28.399 --> 02:29:33.840
Caption: flash came along gave us very dynamic

02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:35.600
Caption: layouts but it had its own problems and

02:29:33.839 --> 02:29:38.318
Caption: we&#39;ve been going through absolute float

02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:40.398
Caption: responsive and i think we&#39;re kind of

02:29:38.319 --> 02:29:43.040
Caption: heading into the intrinsic era which is

02:29:40.399 --> 02:29:44.479
Caption: a term that i&#39;ve seen jen simmons coin

02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:47.120
Caption: it&#39;s talking more about letting the

02:29:44.478 --> 02:29:50.559
Caption: devices define the layout a bit more we

02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:52.080
Caption: have foldable phones we have fridges

02:29:50.559 --> 02:29:55.199
Caption: all sorts of things

02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:57.759
Caption: so all that in 29 short years less than

02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:59.680
Caption: half of that of our friends in the comic

02:29:57.759 --> 02:30:01.919
Caption: industry so it can be really tempting at

02:29:59.679 --> 02:30:03.199
Caption: times to give leia on the web a hard

02:30:01.919 --> 02:30:05.359
Caption: time but

02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:07.919
Caption: given the relatively young age that our

02:30:05.359 --> 02:30:10.160
Caption: industry is i think it&#39;s amazing how far

02:30:07.919 --> 02:30:11.919
Caption: we&#39;ve progressed and we can certainly

02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:13.439
Caption: appreciate what we have now when you

02:30:11.919 --> 02:30:14.879
Caption: consider where it is that we&#39;ve come

02:30:13.439 --> 02:30:15.600
Caption: from

02:30:14.879 --> 02:30:17.519
Caption: so

02:30:15.599 --> 02:30:19.919
Caption: is the current age of the web going to

02:30:17.519 --> 02:30:22.239
Caption: be considered the web&#39;s modern age and

02:30:19.919 --> 02:30:24.160
Caption: with css grid i think that might just be

02:30:22.240 --> 02:30:26.720
Caption: the case

02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:28.640
Caption: so before i jump too much into code this

02:30:26.719 --> 02:30:31.358
Caption: is me anton ball

02:30:28.639 --> 02:30:32.719
Caption: i&#39;m local here to perth

02:30:31.359 --> 02:30:34.080
Caption: and i&#39;ve always kind of brought my

02:30:32.719 --> 02:30:35.599
Caption: daughter along to these events so you

02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:37.439
Caption: might see me rocking around with her a

02:30:35.599 --> 02:30:39.438
Caption: little bit more later

02:30:37.439 --> 02:30:40.640
Caption: and as you know i&#39;m older than html and

02:30:39.439 --> 02:30:43.040
Caption: css

02:30:40.639 --> 02:30:46.318
Caption: i&#39;m a full stack team lead at doest we

02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:48.639
Caption: make todoist and twist applications you

02:30:46.319 --> 02:30:49.760
Caption: can find me on twitter at antonjv if you

02:30:48.639 --> 02:30:51.679
Caption: want to

02:30:49.759 --> 02:30:55.279
Caption: and perhaps this is extra information at

02:30:51.679 --> 02:30:56.080
Caption: this point but i quite enjoy comics

02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:57.600
Caption: so

02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:59.919
Caption: undoubtedly one of the most important

02:30:57.599 --> 02:31:02.080
Caption: comics in history is action comics

02:30:59.919 --> 02:31:04.160
Caption: number one this was as i said released

02:31:02.080 --> 02:31:05.919
Caption: around 1938

02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:07.839
Caption: and what makes it an important comic in

02:31:05.919 --> 02:31:10.719
Caption: the history of all comics is it&#39;s the

02:31:07.839 --> 02:31:12.240
Caption: introduction of superman and just so

02:31:10.719 --> 02:31:15.200
Caption: we&#39;re all clear that&#39;s him holding the

02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:17.439
Caption: car up there now superman has changed a

02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:20.080
Caption: lot through the years but this is where

02:31:17.439 --> 02:31:21.840
Caption: they started

02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:24.000
Caption: the layout throughout the comics and

02:31:21.839 --> 02:31:26.478
Caption: others even in the golden and silver age

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:28.799
Caption: consisted primarily of rows of squares

02:31:26.478 --> 02:31:30.879
Caption: and rectangles if we look at a few of

02:31:28.799 --> 02:31:32.639
Caption: the pages from the comic we can see that

02:31:30.879 --> 02:31:35.519
Caption: pattern in use we&#39;ll have a couple of

02:31:32.639 --> 02:31:38.478
Caption: squares a long larger rectangle with the

02:31:35.519 --> 02:31:39.839
Caption: uh in it but what we are focused on is

02:31:38.478 --> 02:31:43.759
Caption: layout so i&#39;m going to strip out the

02:31:39.839 --> 02:31:46.559
Caption: imagery and see what we are left with

02:31:43.759 --> 02:31:49.279
Caption: the pattern was one to three panels per

02:31:46.559 --> 02:31:51.759
Caption: row staggered throughout the page with a

02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:54.080
Caption: somewhat consistent gap it was printed

02:31:51.759 --> 02:31:55.919
Caption: so you know somewhat consistent

02:31:54.080 --> 02:31:58.319
Caption: in terms of css grid it&#39;s a nice

02:31:55.919 --> 02:31:59.919
Caption: starting off point uh we

02:31:58.319 --> 02:32:02.720
Caption: might think that we can do great

02:31:59.919 --> 02:32:05.120
Caption: template rows and sort of repeat three

02:32:02.719 --> 02:32:06.879
Caption: times over one fraction but

02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:08.560
Caption: we need to go a little bit further if we

02:32:06.879 --> 02:32:11.120
Caption: want to achieve the staggering that we

02:32:08.559 --> 02:32:13.119
Caption: can hopefully see here can you actually

02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:15.359
Caption: see the staggering

02:32:13.120 --> 02:32:18.240
Caption: it&#39;s can you see the gray squares

02:32:15.359 --> 02:32:18.240
Caption: i suspect not

02:32:18.799 --> 02:32:21.200
Caption: um

02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:23.200
Caption: all right

02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:25.200
Caption: so the way i calculated the columns is

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:27.200
Caption: to measure the smallest panel on the

02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:29.520
Caption: layout and divide that by the width of

02:32:27.200 --> 02:32:33.439
Caption: the comet so the smallest panel would be

02:32:29.519 --> 02:32:35.358
Caption: between two gaps there that you can see

02:32:33.439 --> 02:32:37.439
Caption: we aren&#39;t using that size but it gives

02:32:35.359 --> 02:32:38.880
Caption: us the basis with which to work from so

02:32:37.439 --> 02:32:41.359
Caption: between two panels there&#39;s there don&#39;t

02:32:38.879 --> 02:32:43.120
Caption: worry more color comes in later

02:32:41.359 --> 02:32:44.880
Caption: so when we divide the page width which

02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:47.679
Caption: is 576

02:32:44.879 --> 02:32:49.200
Caption: by the 36 which is the smallest panel we

02:32:47.679 --> 02:32:51.120
Caption: could possibly do that gives us the

02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:53.040
Caption: total number of columns we would want to

02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:55.040
Caption: recreate this layout

02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:56.959
Caption: importantly it&#39;s the same aspect ratio

02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:58.479
Caption: as the printed version

02:32:56.959 --> 02:33:00.879
Caption: so turning that into grid we have

02:32:58.478 --> 02:33:05.519
Caption: display grid grid template columns

02:33:00.879 --> 02:33:05.519
Caption: repeat 16 times over one fraction

02:33:05.599 --> 02:33:09.438
Caption: and the grid gap we can be super

02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:10.799
Caption: consistent now because we&#39;re in the web

02:33:09.439 --> 02:33:12.800
Caption: so

02:33:10.799 --> 02:33:14.559
Caption: we don&#39;t need grid template roads in

02:33:12.799 --> 02:33:17.438
Caption: this example because we can rely on the

02:33:14.559 --> 02:33:19.839
Caption: implicit grid to handle that for us

02:33:17.439 --> 02:33:20.960
Caption: and so what do i mean by the implicit

02:33:19.839 --> 02:33:22.559
Caption: grid

02:33:20.959 --> 02:33:25.759
Caption: if we were to fill up all of the

02:33:22.559 --> 02:33:27.759
Caption: contents filling that first defined grid

02:33:25.759 --> 02:33:30.240
Caption: grid will automatically add a new track

02:33:27.759 --> 02:33:33.120
Caption: to the row underneath which will fill up

02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:35.359
Caption: with those columns as well and by

02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:37.600
Caption: default the implicit grid tracks are

02:33:35.359 --> 02:33:39.840
Caption: automatically sized

02:33:37.599 --> 02:33:42.080
Caption: we can start controlling that if we want

02:33:39.839 --> 02:33:43.280
Caption: to with grid order rows or grid auto

02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:44.799
Caption: columns

02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:46.160
Caption: but for the purposes of our demo we&#39;re

02:33:44.799 --> 02:33:50.000
Caption: happy for the grid to just keep

02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:51.919
Caption: repeating over as we use it

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:54.080
Caption: and each panel can then span the number

02:33:51.919 --> 02:33:57.200
Caption: of columns required there so panel one

02:33:54.080 --> 02:34:00.080
Caption: spans across six panel two spans across

02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:01.680
Caption: five and we start to get the layout of

02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:04.160
Caption: our grid with

02:34:01.679 --> 02:34:06.239
Caption: the staggering so there we go we&#39;ve

02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:08.080
Caption: created a comic layout with only a few

02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:09.600
Caption: lines of css

02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:12.719
Caption: and the staggering is a nice touch to

02:34:09.599 --> 02:34:15.599
Caption: avoid being too symmetrical in layout we

02:34:12.719 --> 02:34:17.759
Caption: never want it being all the same

02:34:15.599 --> 02:34:19.438
Caption: but it&#39;s while it&#39;s not much code for a

02:34:17.759 --> 02:34:22.318
Caption: lot of possibilities we aren&#39;t really

02:34:19.439 --> 02:34:24.399
Caption: feeling like superheroes just yet

02:34:22.319 --> 02:34:27.359
Caption: so the layout in action comic one didn&#39;t

02:34:24.399 --> 02:34:29.600
Caption: play a huge role in the story itself so

02:34:27.359 --> 02:34:31.280
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s more used as a container and

02:34:29.599 --> 02:34:35.040
Caption: that was about it

02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:37.520
Caption: so let&#39;s instead jump forward to the

02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:39.839
Caption: bronze age which brings us with a change

02:34:37.519 --> 02:34:41.039
Caption: in how layout did become a part of the

02:34:39.839 --> 02:34:43.358
Caption: story

02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:46.479
Caption: spider-man 1-2-1 was released around

02:34:43.359 --> 02:34:48.080
Caption: 1973 and considered a pivotal point in

02:34:46.478 --> 02:34:50.959
Caption: this character&#39;s

02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:52.319
Caption: sort of story arc and their history

02:34:50.959 --> 02:34:55.200
Caption: now i hope it&#39;s not a spoiler for

02:34:52.319 --> 02:34:57.359
Caption: something from 1973 but this is the

02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:58.719
Caption: death of gwen stacy which if you&#39;ve seen

02:34:57.359 --> 02:35:00.000
Caption: any of the movies lately you&#39;re probably

02:34:58.719 --> 02:35:01.279
Caption: familiar with it we can talk about it

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:03.439
Caption: later

02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:05.760
Caption: so what&#39;s great about this story along

02:35:03.439 --> 02:35:07.680
Caption: with the moment artwork and everything

02:35:05.759 --> 02:35:11.120
Caption: involved is the way that the layout

02:35:07.679 --> 02:35:12.879
Caption: became an integral part of its telling

02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:15.359
Caption: the height of the bridge in the fall is

02:35:12.879 --> 02:35:16.799
Caption: shown beautifully through those spanning

02:35:15.359 --> 02:35:19.200
Caption: panels

02:35:16.799 --> 02:35:21.200
Caption: you wouldn&#39;t get that sense of height

02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:23.359
Caption: or danger from the grid if it was like

02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:25.280
Caption: the previous example all running along

02:35:23.359 --> 02:35:27.040
Caption: several rows

02:35:25.280 --> 02:35:29.359
Caption: so even though it&#39;s a great moment in

02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:32.399
Caption: there let&#39;s again strip out the artwork

02:35:29.359 --> 02:35:34.160
Caption: and see the layout in use

02:35:32.399 --> 02:35:36.560
Caption: so the big difference is the panel

02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:38.000
Caption: spanning multiple rows this is one of

02:35:36.559 --> 02:35:40.000
Caption: the areas where grid has given us a

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:42.639
Caption: sense of a modern layer we&#39;re no longer

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:44.399
Caption: are we constrained to a single axis and

02:35:42.639 --> 02:35:47.438
Caption: the way that i determine the panels was

02:35:44.399 --> 02:35:50.880
Caption: done as the same in the previous one

02:35:47.439 --> 02:35:52.800
Caption: this time though we have 23

02:35:50.879 --> 02:35:54.959
Caption: so we&#39;re still able to rely on implicit

02:35:52.799 --> 02:35:56.799
Caption: grid even though we&#39;re spanning multiple

02:35:54.959 --> 02:36:00.399
Caption: rows now

02:35:56.799 --> 02:36:03.679
Caption: because grid will allow us to do that

02:36:00.399 --> 02:36:05.760
Caption: so we add in panel one we span across

02:36:03.679 --> 02:36:08.239
Caption: nine like we did before but now we can

02:36:05.759 --> 02:36:10.318
Caption: span down three rows and grid will

02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:13.759
Caption: handle that panel two will span across

02:36:10.319 --> 02:36:17.280
Caption: seven panel three uh will be whatever

02:36:13.759 --> 02:36:19.438
Caption: the rest of 23 minus nine and seven is

02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:21.600
Caption: and then panel four will just slide into

02:36:19.439 --> 02:36:23.680
Caption: place there grid gives us a lot of

02:36:21.599 --> 02:36:25.199
Caption: things for free which is nice

02:36:23.679 --> 02:36:27.120
Caption: and we were able to now cover a great

02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:29.759
Caption: many of the layouts during and up to the

02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:31.359
Caption: bronze age

02:36:29.759 --> 02:36:33.759
Caption: so next up in the journey through the

02:36:31.359 --> 02:36:35.680
Caption: ages is watchmen which famous for many

02:36:33.759 --> 02:36:37.519
Caption: reasons like the movie

02:36:35.679 --> 02:36:40.239
Caption: but it kicked off the modern age of

02:36:37.519 --> 02:36:42.398
Caption: comics now watchmen adhered to a strict

02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:44.479
Caption: nine panel grid throughout its run which

02:36:42.399 --> 02:36:46.720
Caption: means what we&#39;ve created so far would

02:36:44.478 --> 02:36:48.398
Caption: essentially cover this whole comic book

02:36:46.719 --> 02:36:49.919
Caption: or this series

02:36:48.399 --> 02:36:52.160
Caption: so there&#39;s hundreds of possibilities

02:36:49.919 --> 02:36:53.839
Caption: with a nine panel grid which is not me

02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:56.399
Caption: recommending everyone go out and do that

02:36:53.839 --> 02:36:57.919
Caption: it just means that it&#39;s very powerful

02:36:56.399 --> 02:37:00.479
Caption: but there was a panel from watchman that

02:36:57.919 --> 02:37:02.639
Caption: i wanted to recreate it did something

02:37:00.478 --> 02:37:04.559
Caption: just a little bit outside the box with

02:37:02.639 --> 02:37:07.040
Caption: grid

02:37:04.559 --> 02:37:08.478
Caption: now the panel in the middle there it&#39;s

02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:10.639
Caption: there&#39;s a lot going on with the speech

02:37:08.478 --> 02:37:13.279
Caption: bubbles but the artwork you can see is

02:37:10.639 --> 02:37:15.358
Caption: the same image running across the three

02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:17.200
Caption: panels it&#39;s not just constrained into

02:37:15.359 --> 02:37:20.720
Caption: one anymore

02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:23.040
Caption: now we could split the image into three

02:37:20.719 --> 02:37:24.000
Caption: if we wanted to it would make it quite

02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:25.679
Caption: easy

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:28.240
Caption: but i think it&#39;s better if we can

02:37:25.679 --> 02:37:29.519
Caption: recreate the effect while we maintain

02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:31.359
Caption: the image

02:37:29.519 --> 02:37:33.039
Caption: it&#39;ll give us some flexibility so if we

02:37:31.359 --> 02:37:34.399
Caption: want to swap the image out later we&#39;re

02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:35.839
Caption: only going to have to do the one and not

02:37:34.399 --> 02:37:38.000
Caption: remember all the various steps and

02:37:35.839 --> 02:37:39.358
Caption: cutting them up into three

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.799
Caption: or if we want to

02:37:39.359 --> 02:37:43.120
Caption: work with some responsiveness which

02:37:40.799 --> 02:37:44.959
Caption: we&#39;ll see in this one

02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:47.359
Caption: so the setup here is similar to what we

02:37:44.959 --> 02:37:50.160
Caption: had before where i&#39;m aiming to have the

02:37:47.359 --> 02:37:51.520
Caption: image remain intact while we add the gap

02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:54.000
Caption: in there

02:37:51.519 --> 02:37:56.239
Caption: so panel 3 which is in the middle we are

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:58.160
Caption: going to wrap that in another grid so we

02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:00.720
Caption: have our main grid laid out like we have

02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:02.719
Caption: before and panel 3 has a grid in there

02:38:00.719 --> 02:38:05.519
Caption: as well and it&#39;s spanning multiple

02:38:02.719 --> 02:38:07.519
Caption: columns so we have room enough to place

02:38:05.519 --> 02:38:09.279
Caption: the gap

02:38:07.519 --> 02:38:12.159
Caption: now only the direct children of a

02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:14.399
Caption: container can become grid items but with

02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:17.200
Caption: subgrid we&#39;re able to inherit the rows

02:38:14.399 --> 02:38:19.280
Caption: or columns from the parent element

02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:21.680
Caption: now that&#39;s what happens here when we add

02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:24.720
Caption: sub grid onto

02:38:21.679 --> 02:38:26.160
Caption: the overlap area

02:38:24.719 --> 02:38:28.239
Caption: so we&#39;ll look at it without the image to

02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:31.520
Caption: try and better understand what&#39;s

02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:34.479
Caption: happening overlap is pulling in the rows

02:38:31.519 --> 02:38:37.039
Caption: from the main comic itself

02:38:34.478 --> 02:38:39.679
Caption: with that sub grid

02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:41.599
Caption: but we don&#39;t if the comics sorry if the

02:38:39.679 --> 02:38:43.759
Caption: columns in the main comic one where to

02:38:41.599 --> 02:38:46.080
Caption: change if we would add more or change it

02:38:43.759 --> 02:38:48.879
Caption: to be a different ratio then the sub

02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:51.280
Caption: panel or overlapper would inherit that

02:38:48.879 --> 02:38:53.358
Caption: so we&#39;re getting that just for free

02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:55.600
Caption: but we don&#39;t have to inherit the whole

02:38:53.359 --> 02:38:57.840
Caption: grid in this case we can set our own

02:38:55.599 --> 02:38:59.839
Caption: rows in there as well so we can only

02:38:57.839 --> 02:39:02.478
Caption: inherit what we want and leave the rest

02:38:59.839 --> 02:39:04.240
Caption: out now why that might be useful is if

02:39:02.478 --> 02:39:05.519
Caption: we were to say add the speech bubbles in

02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:09.120
Caption: we&#39;re going to have a better chance of

02:39:05.519 --> 02:39:11.279
Caption: positioning them on the page

02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:14.560
Caption: so putting the graphics back it&#39;s time

02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:17.120
Caption: to achieve the gap in there

02:39:14.559 --> 02:39:19.919
Caption: we do this with a suitor element we add

02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:24.040
Caption: that to the overlap container

02:39:19.919 --> 02:39:24.040
Caption: in there we give it the same

02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:28.240
Caption: graphic visuals as the outline so we

02:39:26.478 --> 02:39:30.000
Caption: give it the same grid gap and the same

02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:32.000
Caption: coloring i&#39;ve just used a custom

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:34.799
Caption: property there just to kind of give an

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:37.599
Caption: example of how that could be easier

02:39:34.799 --> 02:39:39.919
Caption: and put it into place

02:39:37.599 --> 02:39:41.759
Caption: and so there we go that&#39;s ticked off our

02:39:39.919 --> 02:39:43.759
Caption: goal of maintaining the image while

02:39:41.759 --> 02:39:46.240
Caption: simulating a grid gap

02:39:43.759 --> 02:39:48.160
Caption: now if we wanted say for mobile if for a

02:39:46.240 --> 02:39:50.080
Caption: little bit of responsiveness we could

02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:52.160
Caption: drop that gap off and just have the

02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:55.280
Caption: whole image there if we were thinking

02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:58.479
Caption: outside of just comics here

02:39:55.280 --> 02:40:00.319
Caption: so subgrid is a great next step for grit

02:39:58.478 --> 02:40:01.759
Caption: anytime you&#39;ve struggled to align items

02:40:00.319 --> 02:40:03.520
Caption: without setting the height across

02:40:01.759 --> 02:40:05.120
Caption: multiple panels

02:40:03.519 --> 02:40:06.398
Caption: and i&#39;m sure if you&#39;ve ever done front

02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:08.080
Caption: end you&#39;ve probably had those three

02:40:06.399 --> 02:40:10.240
Caption: panels and there&#39;ll be some headings on

02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:11.839
Caption: the top and some content in the middle

02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:13.359
Caption: and some of them will have like only a

02:40:11.839 --> 02:40:15.358
Caption: tiny bit of text and then the other

02:40:13.359 --> 02:40:18.000
Caption: one&#39;s like a short novel and they all

02:40:15.359 --> 02:40:20.080
Caption: get stretched out so with subgrid we&#39;ll

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:22.399
Caption: start to be able to inherit across rows

02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:24.080
Caption: or across columns and keep them

02:40:22.399 --> 02:40:25.920
Caption: consistent

02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:28.399
Caption: this is an example from the todoist

02:40:25.919 --> 02:40:29.919
Caption: website where we run into this so i&#39;ve

02:40:28.399 --> 02:40:32.399
Caption: used the german language here because

02:40:29.919 --> 02:40:35.679
Caption: they&#39;re always good for like long words

02:40:32.399 --> 02:40:38.080
Caption: that you can test with these areas so if

02:40:35.679 --> 02:40:40.639
Caption: we set height we run the risk of cutting

02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:42.959
Caption: the text off or having that overlap if

02:40:40.639 --> 02:40:44.879
Caption: we set a minimum height well then we

02:40:42.959 --> 02:40:46.639
Caption: have the weird sort of thing where now

02:40:44.879 --> 02:40:48.719
Caption: the buttons aren&#39;t lining up and if you

02:40:46.639 --> 02:40:51.279
Caption: have the designs they typically will

02:40:48.719 --> 02:40:51.279
Caption: line up

02:40:51.359 --> 02:40:55.120
Caption: so we&#39;re running we have that problem so

02:40:53.519 --> 02:40:57.119
Caption: grid and sub grid are going to have us

02:40:55.120 --> 02:40:59.839
Caption: covered if the middle content was to

02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:02.240
Caption: grow the others will grow in all three

02:40:59.839 --> 02:41:04.318
Caption: panels it&#39;ll be very handy and the

02:41:02.240 --> 02:41:06.319
Caption: advantage over the flat grid setup is we

02:41:04.319 --> 02:41:08.080
Caption: get the flexibility of the expanding

02:41:06.319 --> 02:41:09.840
Caption: rows while we get to maintain the

02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:11.919
Caption: semantic relationship of each of the

02:41:09.839 --> 02:41:14.799
Caption: elements each one can be in its own

02:41:11.919 --> 02:41:16.959
Caption: semantic div or whatever it may be

02:41:14.799 --> 02:41:19.120
Caption: and we&#39;re covered

02:41:16.959 --> 02:41:21.438
Caption: but where&#39;s browser support at with some

02:41:19.120 --> 02:41:21.439
Caption: grid

02:41:22.879 --> 02:41:27.040
Caption: not not great

02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:29.600
Caption: we&#39;re still a little bit in experimental

02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:31.759
Caption: territory here and and that&#39;s okay you

02:41:29.599 --> 02:41:34.159
Caption: can still sometimes use it the only

02:41:31.759 --> 02:41:37.519
Caption: browser with subgrid sort of fully

02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:38.959
Caption: implemented is firefox as in released

02:41:37.519 --> 02:41:41.599
Caption: and i actually did it all the way back

02:41:38.959 --> 02:41:45.359
Caption: in 2019 the day after i gave this talk

02:41:41.599 --> 02:41:47.358
Caption: once they did it now safari recently

02:41:45.359 --> 02:41:48.800
Caption: enabled subgrid in the technical preview

02:41:47.359 --> 02:41:50.479
Caption: that&#39;s why i said firefox is the only

02:41:48.799 --> 02:41:52.240
Caption: one but it&#39;s it&#39;s in there which means

02:41:50.478 --> 02:41:54.478
Caption: by the next versions of safari we&#39;ll

02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:56.000
Caption: start to see some grid

02:41:54.478 --> 02:41:58.079
Caption: but there is hope

02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:00.959
Caption: in all of this some grid has been

02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:02.799
Caption: included in interop 2022

02:42:00.959 --> 02:42:05.679
Caption: which is a combined effort by browser

02:42:02.799 --> 02:42:08.478
Caption: vendors and people that also write code

02:42:05.679 --> 02:42:12.160
Caption: for supporting web standards to close a

02:42:08.478 --> 02:42:13.839
Caption: gap in some of these css features

02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:15.679
Caption: so

02:42:13.839 --> 02:42:17.679
Caption: they are all going to basically work

02:42:15.679 --> 02:42:19.759
Caption: towards having subgrid implemented and

02:42:17.679 --> 02:42:22.160
Caption: passing the same test so that it is

02:42:19.759 --> 02:42:24.080
Caption: displayed correctly across all of the

02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:25.520
Caption: browsers

02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:27.359
Caption: before that though

02:42:25.519 --> 02:42:30.000
Caption: and before subgrid is more widely

02:42:27.359 --> 02:42:32.399
Caption: available we can recreate this effect

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:35.200
Caption: with display content so we&#39;ve added that

02:42:32.399 --> 02:42:37.920
Caption: to overlap and essentially what it does

02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:40.719
Caption: is gets rid of that container in there

02:42:37.919 --> 02:42:44.000
Caption: and lifts the items up into the parent

02:42:40.719 --> 02:42:44.000
Caption: grid which is our comic

02:42:44.799 --> 02:42:48.318
Caption: we do lose a semantic meaning though

02:42:46.559 --> 02:42:50.398
Caption: which is why i think subgrid is going to

02:42:48.319 --> 02:42:52.479
Caption: be a better option for us if we had some

02:42:50.399 --> 02:42:55.359
Caption: very specific semantic meaning by adding

02:42:52.478 --> 02:42:58.318
Caption: the display contents it&#39;s gone

02:42:55.359 --> 02:43:00.080
Caption: so that can be a bit of a problem

02:42:58.319 --> 02:43:02.959
Caption: now it&#39;s the next evolution during the

02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:05.359
Caption: modern age of comics where layout

02:43:02.959 --> 02:43:07.438
Caption: really gets creative and interesting

02:43:05.359 --> 02:43:08.880
Caption: we&#39;re revisiting the world of spider-man

02:43:07.439 --> 02:43:11.439
Caption: here we&#39;ll do that a few times because

02:43:08.879 --> 02:43:13.358
Caption: he&#39;s a bit of a favorite of mine

02:43:11.439 --> 02:43:15.920
Caption: but we started to see a new trend in

02:43:13.359 --> 02:43:17.760
Caption: this age of comics

02:43:15.919 --> 02:43:19.759
Caption: this modern age brought with it layering

02:43:17.759 --> 02:43:22.478
Caption: panels to achieve a flow and depth that

02:43:19.759 --> 02:43:23.839
Caption: we hadn&#39;t previously seen artists were

02:43:22.478 --> 02:43:26.318
Caption: able to focus in and provide little

02:43:23.839 --> 02:43:28.799
Caption: detail elements without taking up all

02:43:26.319 --> 02:43:30.800
Caption: the space that others had

02:43:28.799 --> 02:43:33.759
Caption: now layering&#39;s certainly not new to the

02:43:30.799 --> 02:43:36.080
Caption: web but grid enables us to layer in much

02:43:33.759 --> 02:43:37.839
Caption: easier and predictable ways than with a

02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:39.919
Caption: previous option so let&#39;s take a look at

02:43:37.839 --> 02:43:42.000
Caption: some of the code

02:43:39.919 --> 02:43:43.759
Caption: we have display grid we have grid

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:45.359
Caption: template columns and then we have all

02:43:43.759 --> 02:43:47.040
Caption: these numbers

02:43:45.359 --> 02:43:50.080
Caption: and it&#39;s like wow yeah that&#39;s so much

02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:52.000
Caption: easier than what it was before

02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:53.679
Caption: but here&#39;s how i figured it out and if

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:55.359
Caption: you have the artwork

02:43:53.679 --> 02:43:57.358
Caption: that can be useful which we often do

02:43:55.359 --> 02:43:59.279
Caption: with from the the friends in design or

02:43:57.359 --> 02:44:01.040
Caption: if you design yourself

02:43:59.279 --> 02:44:03.600
Caption: and we&#39;ll focus on the rows so the

02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:06.959
Caption: number of rows that we have is nine we

02:44:03.599 --> 02:44:07.759
Caption: have nine we have that we want to place

02:44:06.959 --> 02:44:09.200
Caption: out

02:44:07.759 --> 02:44:10.959
Caption: in here now this is starting to look

02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:12.719
Caption: like a similar trend

02:44:10.959 --> 02:44:14.478
Caption: if we divide the height by the number of

02:44:12.719 --> 02:44:16.959
Caption: rows we get

02:44:14.478 --> 02:44:18.879
Caption: a base for one fraction unit so we can

02:44:16.959 --> 02:44:21.438
Caption: do this with one of the panels as well

02:44:18.879 --> 02:44:23.200
Caption: we can use that as one fraction

02:44:21.439 --> 02:44:24.960
Caption: but this is the way that i kind of went

02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:26.640
Caption: for it

02:44:24.959 --> 02:44:30.160
Caption: so next we divide the height of an

02:44:26.639 --> 02:44:33.438
Caption: individual row by that base fraction

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:35.120
Caption: so 291 is the row we want 109 is the

02:44:33.439 --> 02:44:38.720
Caption: base unit that we&#39;re using and that

02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:40.399
Caption: gives us 2.6 fraction units

02:44:38.719 --> 02:44:43.200
Caption: so what what are these fraction units

02:44:40.399 --> 02:44:44.160
Caption: and why we do we keep using them in grid

02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:46.080
Caption: they

02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:48.080
Caption: give us a bit more flexibility when we

02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:50.719
Caption: need to make everything responsive and

02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:52.479
Caption: maintain the aspect ratio and also if

02:44:50.719 --> 02:44:54.318
Caption: you can&#39;t really use percentages because

02:44:52.478 --> 02:44:56.079
Caption: we have the gap value in grid as well

02:44:54.319 --> 02:44:58.240
Caption: and if you use percentages with gaps

02:44:56.080 --> 02:44:59.520
Caption: things will start to get weird and over

02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:02.000
Caption: overlap

02:44:59.519 --> 02:45:03.919
Caption: but if we use the fractions it&#39;s going

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:06.160
Caption: to stick within those bounds and the

02:45:03.919 --> 02:45:07.839
Caption: gaps will also help to stick it in there

02:45:06.160 --> 02:45:10.080
Caption: or they will they will work together

02:45:07.839 --> 02:45:12.398
Caption: with gap rather than against it

02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:14.879
Caption: and we repeat that same process to

02:45:12.399 --> 02:45:16.720
Caption: determine the columns

02:45:14.879 --> 02:45:18.959
Caption: so there we go that&#39;s how we got to all

02:45:16.719 --> 02:45:20.719
Caption: those numbers

02:45:18.959 --> 02:45:22.879
Caption: now we can then layer our panels over

02:45:20.719 --> 02:45:26.000
Caption: the top where needed using grid row and

02:45:22.879 --> 02:45:28.319
Caption: grid column values so our panel 3 which

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:32.240
Caption: has the young lady in it we have grid

02:45:28.319 --> 02:45:33.200
Caption: row four to seven and grid column five

02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:35.919
Caption: span

02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:36.879
Caption: one and z index just to bring it up onto

02:45:35.919 --> 02:45:39.279
Caption: the top

02:45:36.879 --> 02:45:41.679
Caption: now panel four we have grid row five

02:45:39.279 --> 02:45:44.640
Caption: through to nine so we&#39;re saying from 5 2

02:45:41.679 --> 02:45:47.438
Caption: 9 but interestingly we have grid column

02:45:44.639 --> 02:45:48.478
Caption: 2 to negative 2.

02:45:47.439 --> 02:45:50.479
Caption: so

02:45:48.478 --> 02:45:53.759
Caption: where does this negative 2 come from in

02:45:50.478 --> 02:45:56.478
Caption: here the grid lines each of the lines in

02:45:53.759 --> 02:45:59.040
Caption: a grid are numbered 1 through to n in

02:45:56.478 --> 02:45:59.839
Caption: our case that&#39;s eight the total number

02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:01.279
Caption: of

02:45:59.839 --> 02:46:03.839
Caption: lines that we have

02:46:01.279 --> 02:46:07.680
Caption: so the starting line for panel four is

02:46:03.839 --> 02:46:10.080
Caption: two we want it a little bit in

02:46:07.679 --> 02:46:12.639
Caption: but those lines are also numbered in

02:46:10.080 --> 02:46:15.599
Caption: reverse so from what would be our

02:46:12.639 --> 02:46:18.000
Caption: typical reading order from the

02:46:15.599 --> 02:46:20.159
Caption: right is negative one through to

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:22.399
Caption: negative n or eight

02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:24.719
Caption: so if we wanna

02:46:22.399 --> 02:46:26.080
Caption: finish up two lines in we can use

02:46:24.719 --> 02:46:28.559
Caption: negative two

02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:31.359
Caption: the benefit of that is when inevitably

02:46:28.559 --> 02:46:33.599
Caption: our design changes later on if more

02:46:31.359 --> 02:46:35.600
Caption: lines are to be added into the middle we

02:46:33.599 --> 02:46:38.239
Caption: don&#39;t have to update everywhere that we

02:46:35.599 --> 02:46:40.478
Caption: do it if we said span to the distance we

02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:41.919
Caption: want and then we add something new well

02:46:40.478 --> 02:46:43.519
Caption: then now we have to go and update

02:46:41.919 --> 02:46:45.599
Caption: everything so as long as we&#39;re not

02:46:43.519 --> 02:46:48.799
Caption: changing that too much it will adjust

02:46:45.599 --> 02:46:50.478
Caption: with the grid it can be pretty handy

02:46:48.799 --> 02:46:52.478
Caption: and most of the browser dev tools will

02:46:50.478 --> 02:46:54.959
Caption: show you these numbers in this case it&#39;s

02:46:52.478 --> 02:46:56.559
Caption: firefox but you can inspect the element

02:46:54.959 --> 02:46:59.599
Caption: and typically you can turn on line

02:46:56.559 --> 02:47:01.599
Caption: numbers line names and other properties

02:46:59.599 --> 02:47:04.478
Caption: like that

02:47:01.599 --> 02:47:06.879
Caption: so the modern age have made prolific use

02:47:04.478 --> 02:47:10.000
Caption: of this layering this is another

02:47:06.879 --> 02:47:11.519
Caption: example of hawkeye

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.799
Caption: and it can be a great way to finally

02:47:11.519 --> 02:47:14.719
Caption: break out of the boxes that have

02:47:12.799 --> 02:47:17.200
Caption: contained us in design and layout for so

02:47:14.719 --> 02:47:19.679
Caption: many years here&#39;s the web recreation on

02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:21.279
Caption: the other side that i&#39;ve done

02:47:19.679 --> 02:47:23.358
Caption: and we&#39;re not using gap here we&#39;re just

02:47:21.279 --> 02:47:25.279
Caption: adding some borders so that we can

02:47:23.359 --> 02:47:27.520
Caption: because grid can&#39;t do sort of funky gaps

02:47:25.279 --> 02:47:29.520
Caption: like that but we can overlay each of

02:47:27.519 --> 02:47:31.358
Caption: them on there and then start to add some

02:47:29.519 --> 02:47:35.839
Caption: borders and create some real interesting

02:47:31.359 --> 02:47:35.840
Caption: depth into some of our designs

02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:39.439
Caption: but

02:47:37.359 --> 02:47:41.840
Caption: with great power comes great

02:47:39.439 --> 02:47:43.439
Caption: responsibility

02:47:41.839 --> 02:47:45.120
Caption: to keep with the theme

02:47:43.439 --> 02:47:46.960
Caption: of what i&#39;m doing

02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:49.359
Caption: layering is an exciting addition to our

02:47:46.959 --> 02:47:51.120
Caption: layout toolboxes but we do have to

02:47:49.359 --> 02:47:52.959
Caption: consider more than just the layout it

02:47:51.120 --> 02:47:54.560
Caption: opens up to us there&#39;s an inherent

02:47:52.959 --> 02:47:57.120
Caption: danger here when you can just position

02:47:54.559 --> 02:47:59.438
Caption: something anywhere on the page

02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:01.200
Caption: if the source order isn&#39;t created

02:47:59.439 --> 02:48:03.520
Caption: in a way that makes sense you can

02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:05.200
Caption: negatively impact the accessibility of

02:48:03.519 --> 02:48:07.199
Caption: your project

02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:10.319
Caption: so as an example if we decided that the

02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:13.359
Caption: panel 4 was better up the top we can

02:48:10.319 --> 02:48:15.680
Caption: just do that we can move it with grid

02:48:13.359 --> 02:48:17.919
Caption: but solely changing the visual layout is

02:48:15.679 --> 02:48:20.799
Caption: not going to tell the browser

02:48:17.919 --> 02:48:22.478
Caption: that the source order has changed so a

02:48:20.799 --> 02:48:25.438
Caption: screen reader might come in and start to

02:48:22.478 --> 02:48:28.239
Caption: go through that information by going the

02:48:25.439 --> 02:48:28.960
Caption: first sort of few images to the girl to

02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:31.600
Caption: the

02:48:28.959 --> 02:48:33.759
Caption: field whereas we&#39;ve now changed the

02:48:31.599 --> 02:48:35.358
Caption: visual order to field and then the other

02:48:33.759 --> 02:48:38.719
Caption: thing is going down so that&#39;s something

02:48:35.359 --> 02:48:38.720
Caption: that we need to be careful of

02:48:39.839 --> 02:48:44.000
Caption: to avoid falling into this trap there&#39;s

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:45.839
Caption: a few things that we can do we can look

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:47.519
Caption: at the structure of our document first

02:48:45.839 --> 02:48:50.398
Caption: and make sure that we&#39;re layering it out

02:48:47.519 --> 02:48:51.839
Caption: in html order correctly

02:48:50.399 --> 02:48:54.720
Caption: we can then create the grid that

02:48:51.839 --> 02:48:57.438
Caption: supports that and then like any hero be

02:48:54.719 --> 02:49:00.000
Caption: vigilant and maintain that order when

02:48:57.439 --> 02:49:01.439
Caption: you are working on these

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:04.399
Caption: a really good place to start reading

02:49:01.439 --> 02:49:06.319
Caption: into grid accessibility is mdm&#39;s layout

02:49:04.399 --> 02:49:08.399
Caption: and accessibility

02:49:06.319 --> 02:49:10.800
Caption: guide that they have on the article

02:49:08.399 --> 02:49:13.439
Caption: on the website sorry

02:49:10.799 --> 02:49:15.278
Caption: so a common criticism of web design and

02:49:13.439 --> 02:49:17.439
Caption: layout is that everything is within a

02:49:15.279 --> 02:49:19.600
Caption: box you may have heard it sort of the

02:49:17.439 --> 02:49:21.840
Caption: reference to bootstrap layouts or maybe

02:49:19.599 --> 02:49:23.839
Caption: a little bit of those libraries that

02:49:21.839 --> 02:49:24.559
Caption: have helped us work fast

02:49:23.839 --> 02:49:26.478
Caption: but

02:49:24.559 --> 02:49:29.199
Caption: have reduced some of the creativity that

02:49:26.478 --> 02:49:30.879
Caption: we&#39;re able to get from these frameworks

02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:32.399
Caption: and so far looking at a lot of these

02:49:30.879 --> 02:49:35.599
Caption: comics we have some layering but

02:49:32.399 --> 02:49:37.680
Caption: everything is still a box

02:49:35.599 --> 02:49:39.679
Caption: now for comics boxy layout started to

02:49:37.679 --> 02:49:42.639
Caption: change during the modern age of comics

02:49:39.679 --> 02:49:44.639
Caption: the characters broke out of their boxes

02:49:42.639 --> 02:49:45.679
Caption: and the storytelling once again evolved

02:49:44.639 --> 02:49:47.919
Caption: with them

02:49:45.679 --> 02:49:50.000
Caption: now this is a nice example from phoenix

02:49:47.919 --> 02:49:51.839
Caption: and jean grey

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:54.399
Caption: showing how different shapes can enhance

02:49:51.839 --> 02:49:56.959
Caption: the storytelling and our recreated

02:49:54.399 --> 02:50:00.720
Caption: example alongside it so that is running

02:49:56.959 --> 02:50:02.719
Caption: and it is of a valid website

02:50:00.719 --> 02:50:05.519
Caption: so fundamentally everything within a

02:50:02.719 --> 02:50:09.200
Caption: grid is still going to be a box we can&#39;t

02:50:05.519 --> 02:50:11.839
Caption: do random shapes like this

02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:13.759
Caption: but we can combine our boxes with some

02:50:11.839 --> 02:50:15.679
Caption: new techniques and get a bit creative

02:50:13.759 --> 02:50:18.478
Caption: and give the illusion of almost any

02:50:15.679 --> 02:50:20.160
Caption: shape that we like

02:50:18.478 --> 02:50:22.559
Caption: so there&#39;s a little bit of boilerplate

02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:24.399
Caption: in this we&#39;re setting up our comic to

02:50:22.559 --> 02:50:25.759
Caption: contain everything we&#39;ve got position

02:50:24.399 --> 02:50:27.439
Caption: relative because we&#39;re going to do some

02:50:25.759 --> 02:50:28.799
Caption: absolute positioning and floating and

02:50:27.439 --> 02:50:31.120
Caption: things are going to get weird so we&#39;ve

02:50:28.799 --> 02:50:33.519
Caption: got overflow hidden on there as well to

02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:35.439
Caption: make sure nothing escapes

02:50:33.519 --> 02:50:36.398
Caption: we want it to break out of the box but

02:50:35.439 --> 02:50:38.479
Caption: not too far

02:50:36.399 --> 02:50:40.800
Caption: i&#39;m gonna keep it in there

02:50:38.478 --> 02:50:43.919
Caption: now the panels grids has a column for

02:50:40.799 --> 02:50:46.559
Caption: each of our five panels and they&#39;re just

02:50:43.919 --> 02:50:47.839
Caption: regular panels going along like we&#39;ve

02:50:46.559 --> 02:50:50.079
Caption: seen before

02:50:47.839 --> 02:50:51.279
Caption: but we can only see a few of the images

02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:53.040
Caption: and that&#39;s because we&#39;re needing to

02:50:51.279 --> 02:50:55.200
Caption: overlap everything because we&#39;re going

02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:56.799
Caption: to be cutting away some of the image we

02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:58.640
Caption: need the other ones sitting underneath

02:50:56.799 --> 02:51:00.879
Caption: we can&#39;t have each one in its own cell

02:50:58.639 --> 02:51:02.879
Caption: because if we go away and sort of cut

02:51:00.879 --> 02:51:05.279
Caption: away the image the background is going

02:51:02.879 --> 02:51:07.599
Caption: to show through where we want the image

02:51:05.279 --> 02:51:09.680
Caption: now hopefully to help visualize this is

02:51:07.599 --> 02:51:10.959
Caption: the layering that we&#39;re working with in

02:51:09.679 --> 02:51:12.639
Caption: our grid

02:51:10.959 --> 02:51:15.120
Caption: in there

02:51:12.639 --> 02:51:16.719
Caption: so our panel container is then rotated

02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:18.799
Caption: and using absolute position sort of

02:51:16.719 --> 02:51:21.358
Caption: positioned along the bottom whereabouts

02:51:18.799 --> 02:51:23.599
Caption: we want it and we&#39;ve rotated it a little

02:51:21.359 --> 02:51:25.919
Caption: bit and just sort of shimming it down

02:51:23.599 --> 02:51:27.519
Caption: about where we want look the details

02:51:25.919 --> 02:51:29.120
Caption: aren&#39;t super important we&#39;ve put it down

02:51:27.519 --> 02:51:31.679
Caption: there

02:51:29.120 --> 02:51:35.040
Caption: so clip path is what&#39;s going to enable

02:51:31.679 --> 02:51:37.040
Caption: these shapes that we&#39;ve wanted

02:51:35.040 --> 02:51:40.080
Caption: when you add a clip path rule in this

02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:41.919
Caption: case a polygon we have an x y value for

02:51:40.080 --> 02:51:44.639
Caption: each of those things and it makes its

02:51:41.919 --> 02:51:48.799
Caption: way around the shape and that gives us

02:51:44.639 --> 02:51:51.679
Caption: the image now we can apply a clip path

02:51:48.799 --> 02:51:54.080
Caption: to each of our images and then we&#39;ve

02:51:51.679 --> 02:51:55.759
Caption: most of the way there with what we were

02:51:54.080 --> 02:51:56.959
Caption: doing

02:51:55.759 --> 02:51:59.120
Caption: now

02:51:56.959 --> 02:52:00.478
Caption: again we&#39;ve got like all these random

02:51:59.120 --> 02:52:02.080
Caption: numbers

02:52:00.478 --> 02:52:04.318
Caption: on there and you&#39;re probably thinking

02:52:02.080 --> 02:52:06.160
Caption: this still doesn&#39;t look easier

02:52:04.319 --> 02:52:07.760
Caption: but firefox has given us some great

02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:09.359
Caption: tools here the dev tools are really

02:52:07.759 --> 02:52:11.599
Caption: going to come in handy when you start

02:52:09.359 --> 02:52:14.640
Caption: doing some things like this

02:52:11.599 --> 02:52:17.040
Caption: if you select the icon in there

02:52:14.639 --> 02:52:18.318
Caption: you can start to move the nodes around

02:52:17.040 --> 02:52:20.719
Caption: yourself

02:52:18.319 --> 02:52:22.879
Caption: and you can double click to add a new

02:52:20.719 --> 02:52:25.200
Caption: node and start to drag that and you&#39;ll

02:52:22.879 --> 02:52:27.599
Caption: see the values are updating in the dev

02:52:25.200 --> 02:52:29.680
Caption: tools so to create this i was doing that

02:52:27.599 --> 02:52:34.080
Caption: in the dev tools and then copying that

02:52:29.679 --> 02:52:36.639
Caption: value across and adjusting as i need it

02:52:34.080 --> 02:52:38.000
Caption: now for the white border we can&#39;t use

02:52:36.639 --> 02:52:41.120
Caption: grid gap because everything&#39;s

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:42.959
Caption: overlapping so the box the container has

02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:44.959
Caption: a white background and then the same

02:52:42.959 --> 02:52:47.279
Caption: clip path is added to the image but jen

02:52:44.959 --> 02:52:49.279
Caption: just shrunk down a little bit

02:52:47.279 --> 02:52:51.120
Caption: and because we&#39;re doing that we need to

02:52:49.279 --> 02:52:52.319
Caption: slightly tweak the transform origin

02:52:51.120 --> 02:52:54.160
Caption: because we&#39;re dealing with some pretty

02:52:52.319 --> 02:52:55.600
Caption: funny shapes here there&#39;s a lot of

02:52:54.160 --> 02:52:57.520
Caption: little adjustments you&#39;ll need to do

02:52:55.599 --> 02:52:58.959
Caption: when you start making shapes like this

02:52:57.519 --> 02:53:00.398
Caption: but

02:52:58.959 --> 02:53:02.160
Caption: that&#39;s one of the downsides of the

02:53:00.399 --> 02:53:06.880
Caption: technique you&#39;re going to have to manage

02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:06.879
Caption: the grid gap manually yourself

02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:11.359
Caption: but there we go we&#39;ve recreated the

02:53:09.279 --> 02:53:12.560
Caption: shapes from that comic which when you

02:53:11.359 --> 02:53:14.319
Caption: initially look at it you would have

02:53:12.559 --> 02:53:16.799
Caption: thought there&#39;s no way we can do that

02:53:14.319 --> 02:53:18.479
Caption: sort of layout on the web

02:53:16.799 --> 02:53:22.318
Caption: and if you haven&#39;t seen it yet each of

02:53:18.478 --> 02:53:23.759
Caption: the links underneath it to the code pen

02:53:22.319 --> 02:53:25.200
Caption: versions of each of these so you can

02:53:23.759 --> 02:53:26.879
Caption: have a look at them and play but i have

02:53:25.200 --> 02:53:29.520
Caption: a another link at the end which will

02:53:26.879 --> 02:53:32.959
Caption: link to all of them

02:53:29.519 --> 02:53:34.478
Caption: so clip path is no doubt a powerful tool

02:53:32.959 --> 02:53:35.679
Caption: when combined with grid so we&#39;re going

02:53:34.478 --> 02:53:38.398
Caption: to have another

02:53:35.679 --> 02:53:40.799
Caption: example here which is detective comics

02:53:38.399 --> 02:53:42.880
Caption: number 876

02:53:40.799 --> 02:53:44.959
Caption: taking the grid layering and from our

02:53:42.879 --> 02:53:47.120
Caption: earlier examples we can recreate this

02:53:44.959 --> 02:53:48.639
Caption: same layout the drawing&#39;s a little more

02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:50.160
Caption: intense

02:53:48.639 --> 02:53:51.919
Caption: but it&#39;s the layout in the background

02:53:50.160 --> 02:53:52.959
Caption: we&#39;re going to focus on batman could be

02:53:51.919 --> 02:53:54.639
Caption: done by

02:53:52.959 --> 02:53:56.879
Caption: just the layering that we looked at

02:53:54.639 --> 02:53:58.478
Caption: before

02:53:56.879 --> 02:54:00.559
Caption: the shapes can be recreated by adding

02:53:58.478 --> 02:54:02.478
Caption: perspective and rotating the panel so

02:54:00.559 --> 02:54:04.639
Caption: we&#39;ve added our grid we&#39;re adding a

02:54:02.478 --> 02:54:07.438
Caption: panel to the grid in similar ways that

02:54:04.639 --> 02:54:09.278
Caption: we have before and then we transform we

02:54:07.439 --> 02:54:11.680
Caption: use some perspective that gives us that

02:54:09.279 --> 02:54:13.359
Caption: nice little angle and rotate it into

02:54:11.679 --> 02:54:14.959
Caption: that and then the same with panel two

02:54:13.359 --> 02:54:16.479
Caption: all the way down but you can see there&#39;s

02:54:14.959 --> 02:54:18.160
Caption: a problem here

02:54:16.478 --> 02:54:20.159
Caption: in that the blue background of each of

02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:22.160
Caption: them is coming through we didn&#39;t want

02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:24.719
Caption: that we wanted just the squares going

02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:26.959
Caption: down the page and sort of forming one

02:54:24.719 --> 02:54:29.200
Caption: shape

02:54:26.959 --> 02:54:31.359
Caption: again we can use clip path here to cut

02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:33.279
Caption: out the part clip path is sort of

02:54:31.359 --> 02:54:34.479
Caption: showing the part that we do want visible

02:54:33.279 --> 02:54:36.000
Caption: so you&#39;re kind of doing you&#39;re not

02:54:34.478 --> 02:54:37.679
Caption: cutting out the stuff that you don&#39;t

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.240
Caption: you&#39;re making the part that you do want

02:54:37.679 --> 02:54:41.759
Caption: visible but with each panel having a

02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:43.919
Caption: clip path on it

02:54:41.759 --> 02:54:46.398
Caption: it gives the impression of a border

02:54:43.919 --> 02:54:48.478
Caption: going all the way down while giving us

02:54:46.399 --> 02:54:52.240
Caption: that shape so it&#39;s again something quite

02:54:48.478 --> 02:54:56.318
Caption: interesting and different for the web

02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:58.319
Caption: so there it is next to mr batman

02:54:56.319 --> 02:55:00.319
Caption: now clip path isn&#39;t limited to just

02:54:58.319 --> 02:55:03.040
Caption: polygons there is a lot going on in

02:55:00.319 --> 02:55:05.439
Caption: these images but we have flash on the

02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:07.200
Caption: side and i particularly enjoy the cats

02:55:05.439 --> 02:55:09.840
Caption: up the top here

02:55:07.200 --> 02:55:11.359
Caption: it looks like two-face to keep with our

02:55:09.839 --> 02:55:14.080
Caption: comic book thing so we&#39;ve got our

02:55:11.359 --> 02:55:15.359
Caption: polygons that we&#39;ve seen

02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:17.359
Caption: but

02:55:15.359 --> 02:55:19.520
Caption: there are some other options ellipse

02:55:17.359 --> 02:55:22.080
Caption: allows for oval shape again the first

02:55:19.519 --> 02:55:23.839
Caption: two values are our radius and then the x

02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:25.439
Caption: and y allows us to offset it a little

02:55:23.839 --> 02:55:27.919
Caption: bit

02:55:25.439 --> 02:55:30.640
Caption: and circle for a more uniform shape

02:55:27.919 --> 02:55:33.120
Caption: similar to ellipse the first value is a

02:55:30.639 --> 02:55:35.839
Caption: radius followed by the position and we

02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:37.759
Caption: can have something else

02:55:35.839 --> 02:55:40.559
Caption: so clip path affected the shape of the

02:55:37.759 --> 02:55:43.278
Caption: container but we can also have the text

02:55:40.559 --> 02:55:46.000
Caption: react to the shape of the container as

02:55:43.279 --> 02:55:48.479
Caption: well using css shapes

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:49.519
Caption: this is a panel from saga and the part

02:55:48.478 --> 02:55:52.159
Caption: that&#39;s

02:55:49.519 --> 02:55:54.559
Caption: important here is how the moon has its

02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:56.719
Caption: curve or the planet and then the text is

02:55:54.559 --> 02:55:59.679
Caption: also curving along that now this has

02:55:56.719 --> 02:56:03.120
Caption: existed in magazines for a long time

02:55:59.679 --> 02:56:04.879
Caption: but it&#39;s been absent for from the web

02:56:03.120 --> 02:56:07.679
Caption: but again we&#39;ll do a little bit of setup

02:56:04.879 --> 02:56:09.839
Caption: here we have our panel position relative

02:56:07.679 --> 02:56:12.959
Caption: because we&#39;re moving things about again

02:56:09.839 --> 02:56:14.639
Caption: uh paragraph we shift it into place and

02:56:12.959 --> 02:56:16.319
Caption: the important part here is our image

02:56:14.639 --> 02:56:18.559
Caption: which we&#39;ve moved to the side we could

02:56:16.319 --> 02:56:20.240
Caption: have done this with grid as well uh the

02:56:18.559 --> 02:56:22.239
Caption: width and the height but the shape

02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:24.399
Caption: outside is what we&#39;re interested in the

02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:26.720
Caption: circle

02:56:24.399 --> 02:56:29.439
Caption: so firefox again has been helping us

02:56:26.719 --> 02:56:31.599
Caption: developers out with the dev tools we can

02:56:29.439 --> 02:56:32.800
Caption: apply a shape outside and just use some

02:56:31.599 --> 02:56:35.358
Caption: values

02:56:32.799 --> 02:56:38.160
Caption: but then we can select that icon and

02:56:35.359 --> 02:56:40.240
Caption: start resizing in real time and

02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:41.359
Caption: i am certainly a visual kind of a

02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:43.200
Caption: learner and

02:56:41.359 --> 02:56:45.760
Caption: i like to see things happening with code

02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:46.879
Caption: maybe that&#39;s why i prefer the front end

02:56:45.759 --> 02:56:48.639
Caption: but

02:56:46.879 --> 02:56:50.398
Caption: we can see that and we can take those

02:56:48.639 --> 02:56:52.080
Caption: values and we can move it back to our

02:56:50.399 --> 02:56:54.399
Caption: css so it&#39;s really nice that the tools

02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:55.679
Caption: are helping us with this creative coding

02:56:54.399 --> 02:56:57.200
Caption: side of things

02:56:55.679 --> 02:56:58.160
Caption: that didn&#39;t mean to skip but we&#39;ll move

02:56:57.200 --> 02:57:00.399
Caption: on

02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:02.959
Caption: the shapes can also be more complex than

02:57:00.399 --> 02:57:04.319
Caption: just circles so

02:57:02.959 --> 02:57:06.399
Caption: there is definitely going to be a moment

02:57:04.319 --> 02:57:08.800
Caption: in your career where a designer comes to

02:57:06.399 --> 02:57:11.040
Caption: you and says we&#39;ve got a cat

02:57:08.799 --> 02:57:13.438
Caption: and we need the text to wrap around it

02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:15.359
Caption: you guys saw these ones

02:57:13.439 --> 02:57:17.359
Caption: and so we can use the polygon shape that

02:57:15.359 --> 02:57:19.919
Caption: we&#39;ve had before and we can draw around

02:57:17.359 --> 02:57:20.800
Caption: our cat and we can do that

02:57:19.919 --> 02:57:22.398
Caption: now

02:57:20.799 --> 02:57:24.080
Caption: we can also

02:57:22.399 --> 02:57:26.240
Caption: with something that clip path didn&#39;t

02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:28.799
Caption: allow us but shape outside does is use

02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:30.399
Caption: an alpha mass so if we have our cat

02:57:28.799 --> 02:57:32.559
Caption: and then we have an alpha mass that

02:57:30.399 --> 02:57:34.479
Caption: represents the shape of our cat very

02:57:32.559 --> 02:57:37.839
Caption: similar to a background image we can say

02:57:34.478 --> 02:57:39.919
Caption: shape outside url cat mask there&#39;s some

02:57:37.839 --> 02:57:42.478
Caption: cause funniness in here

02:57:39.919 --> 02:57:43.839
Caption: but that&#39;s boring this is kind of what

02:57:42.478 --> 02:57:45.438
Caption: we&#39;re gonna look at here and you can

02:57:43.839 --> 02:57:46.639
Caption: look at the course problems later it

02:57:45.439 --> 02:57:48.960
Caption: needs to be on the same domain

02:57:46.639 --> 02:57:51.120
Caption: essentially

02:57:48.959 --> 02:57:54.160
Caption: so what we&#39;ve created is a great example

02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:57.600
Caption: of the modern web but it is based on a

02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:59.919
Caption: western modern web it&#39;s western comics

02:57:57.599 --> 02:58:01.919
Caption: styles and structures

02:57:59.919 --> 02:58:03.359
Caption: that&#39;s reading left to right top to

02:58:01.919 --> 02:58:05.040
Caption: bottom

02:58:03.359 --> 02:58:07.520
Caption: the structure and reading style isn&#39;t

02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:09.679
Caption: the only comic structure that exists

02:58:07.519 --> 02:58:12.879
Caption: though for instance japan has a very

02:58:09.679 --> 02:58:15.120
Caption: healthy industry with its manga

02:58:12.879 --> 02:58:16.719
Caption: i&#39;ve been a particular fan of naruto for

02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:17.679
Caption: a while so it&#39;s fun again that i get to

02:58:16.719 --> 02:58:20.398
Caption: just keep

02:58:17.679 --> 02:58:21.519
Caption: putting all of my uh hobbies into this

02:58:20.399 --> 02:58:23.520
Caption: talk

02:58:21.519 --> 02:58:26.719
Caption: but this is the same page from the manga

02:58:23.519 --> 02:58:28.000
Caption: in japanese and in english now even with

02:58:26.719 --> 02:58:30.879
Caption: the english one we can see that the

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:32.959
Caption: start is on the other side to what we&#39;re

02:58:30.879 --> 02:58:34.240
Caption: used to and it finishes on the other

02:58:32.959 --> 02:58:35.679
Caption: side of there

02:58:34.240 --> 02:58:39.759
Caption: but the english version even though it&#39;s

02:58:35.679 --> 02:58:39.759
Caption: translated they kept the layout the same

02:58:39.839 --> 02:58:43.200
Caption: we could position the cells in our grid

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.240
Caption: in this way

02:58:43.200 --> 02:58:46.479
Caption: quite

02:58:44.240 --> 02:58:48.080
Caption: straightforward but we&#39;ll remember from

02:58:46.478 --> 02:58:50.239
Caption: before

02:58:48.080 --> 02:58:52.639
Caption: the source order matters so if we were

02:58:50.240 --> 02:58:54.560
Caption: to have alt text and everything on here

02:58:52.639 --> 02:58:56.799
Caption: if we were to put it in that order then

02:58:54.559 --> 02:58:59.519
Caption: the screen reader is going to read it

02:58:56.799 --> 02:59:01.519
Caption: somewhat backwards more from the top

02:58:59.519 --> 02:59:02.959
Caption: down to the other side

02:59:01.519 --> 02:59:05.358
Caption: oops

02:59:02.959 --> 02:59:08.000
Caption: so when placed into the grid with a left

02:59:05.359 --> 02:59:10.240
Caption: to right direction we can do it like so

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:12.559
Caption: we&#39;ll have our first panel second third

02:59:10.240 --> 02:59:15.200
Caption: through to the sixth so similar to at

02:59:12.559 --> 02:59:18.000
Caption: least in my experience a reading style

02:59:15.200 --> 02:59:18.000
Caption: that i&#39;m used to

02:59:18.319 --> 02:59:22.240
Caption: grid has us really

02:59:20.080 --> 02:59:24.319
Caption: well covered for internationalization

02:59:22.240 --> 02:59:26.080
Caption: when direction right to left

02:59:24.319 --> 02:59:27.600
Caption: is applied this can be in multiple

02:59:26.080 --> 02:59:29.759
Caption: places in the page but i&#39;ve done it

02:59:27.599 --> 02:59:31.839
Caption: directly here on the main

02:59:29.759 --> 02:59:34.879
Caption: grid just flips it

02:59:31.839 --> 02:59:37.120
Caption: to what right to left is so panel one is

02:59:34.879 --> 02:59:39.279
Caption: now over to the side two three four five

02:59:37.120 --> 02:59:40.799
Caption: so we&#39;ve covered the accessibility by

02:59:39.279 --> 02:59:43.200
Caption: putting it in the correct order we&#39;ve

02:59:40.799 --> 02:59:47.679
Caption: added our grid but then we&#39;ve enabled

02:59:43.200 --> 02:59:49.600
Caption: other styles with a simple property

02:59:47.679 --> 02:59:52.719
Caption: so of interest in this comic you&#39;ll

02:59:49.599 --> 02:59:55.040
Caption: notice the difference in grid gaps

02:59:52.719 --> 02:59:57.679
Caption: in the example you can do that as well

02:59:55.040 --> 02:59:59.839
Caption: with uh grid gap it doesn&#39;t always have

02:59:57.679 --> 03:00:03.278
Caption: to be consistent in here we&#39;re affecting

02:59:59.839 --> 03:00:06.240
Caption: the horizontal and the vertical gap

03:00:03.279 --> 03:00:08.399
Caption: what&#39;s also worth noting in the manga is

03:00:06.240 --> 03:00:12.479
Caption: that the text runs vertically but in

03:00:08.399 --> 03:00:13.840
Caption: english it&#39;s left to right

03:00:12.478 --> 03:00:16.719
Caption: now i didn&#39;t want to attempt to write

03:00:13.839 --> 03:00:18.318
Caption: japanese so i did it with english and

03:00:16.719 --> 03:00:20.239
Caption: you do get a bit of a weird thing where

03:00:18.319 --> 03:00:22.160
Caption: the text runs that way but with writing

03:00:20.240 --> 03:00:23.200
Caption: mode vertical right to left

03:00:22.160 --> 03:00:25.439
Caption: it will

03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:28.080
Caption: go in the direction that someone like

03:00:25.439 --> 03:00:31.279
Caption: that would be expecting

03:00:28.080 --> 03:00:33.599
Caption: with a logographic typeset such as what

03:00:31.279 --> 03:00:36.080
Caption: japanese has that will work out

03:00:33.599 --> 03:00:37.599
Caption: correctly

03:00:36.080 --> 03:00:39.599
Caption: not actually sure why it does that with

03:00:37.599 --> 03:00:42.000
Caption: english but i&#39;m sure there&#39;s a really

03:00:39.599 --> 03:00:43.759
Caption: valid explanation

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:45.519
Caption: so that brings us to the end of our

03:00:43.759 --> 03:00:48.398
Caption: journey through the ages of comic and

03:00:45.519 --> 03:00:49.839
Caption: how they can be brought to the web

03:00:48.399 --> 03:00:51.680
Caption: i mentioned at the start that although

03:00:49.839 --> 03:00:53.358
Caption: the examples are for comics to think

03:00:51.679 --> 03:00:55.040
Caption: about how you can apply these to the

03:00:53.359 --> 03:00:56.319
Caption: projects that you&#39;re working on and i

03:00:55.040 --> 03:00:59.040
Caption: hope the various effects that i&#39;ve

03:00:56.319 --> 03:01:00.879
Caption: demonstrated have sparked some ideas of

03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:02.639
Caption: something different that you can do with

03:01:00.879 --> 03:01:04.959
Caption: layout

03:01:02.639 --> 03:01:06.799
Caption: and taking it to the everyday products

03:01:04.959 --> 03:01:09.040
Caption: of the web

03:01:06.799 --> 03:01:11.200
Caption: we&#39;ve been in these layout boxes for

03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:13.919
Caption: quite some time so imagine when you

03:01:11.200 --> 03:01:15.520
Caption: apply these layouts to your projects

03:01:13.919 --> 03:01:16.799
Caption: sort of great things will start to

03:01:15.519 --> 03:01:18.079
Caption: happen

03:01:16.799 --> 03:01:21.839
Caption: and that&#39;s why i believe we&#39;re now in

03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:24.160
Caption: the modern age of the layout on the web

03:01:21.839 --> 03:01:26.478
Caption: css grid gives us great new powers and

03:01:24.160 --> 03:01:28.479
Caption: flexibility with our layout we saw how

03:01:26.478 --> 03:01:30.959
Caption: we could stagger content layer our

03:01:28.478 --> 03:01:33.438
Caption: panels to create depth and interest the

03:01:30.959 --> 03:01:35.120
Caption: coming css grid level 2

03:01:33.439 --> 03:01:37.520
Caption: spec will give us the ability with

03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:38.799
Caption: subgrid to align better across multiple

03:01:37.519 --> 03:01:40.398
Caption: panels

03:01:38.799 --> 03:01:42.959
Caption: and getting a little more creative and

03:01:40.399 --> 03:01:46.000
Caption: breaking out of the layout box the css

03:01:42.959 --> 03:01:48.160
Caption: shapes clip path and shape outside

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:50.559
Caption: making our projects as accessible to as

03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:53.919
Caption: wide an audience as possible with grid&#39;s

03:01:50.559 --> 03:01:55.919
Caption: great support for internationalization

03:01:53.919 --> 03:01:59.279
Caption: i mentioned earlier that the code pens

03:01:55.919 --> 03:02:01.359
Caption: were all available this is the url where

03:01:59.279 --> 03:02:03.680
Caption: you can find them and i also have it

03:02:01.359 --> 03:02:06.479
Caption: linked on my twitter if you want to have

03:02:03.679 --> 03:02:09.040
Caption: them play around with those

03:02:06.478 --> 03:02:10.799
Caption: in a talk setting it can be hard to get

03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:12.240
Caption: through everything

03:02:10.799 --> 03:02:14.639
Caption: did you get the photo do you want me to

03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:14.640
Caption: go back

03:02:15.040 --> 03:02:19.200
Caption: it can be hard to get through everything

03:02:16.639 --> 03:02:22.478
Caption: in a talk setting so i&#39;ve written blog

03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:24.479
Caption: posts that go through each one of those

03:02:22.478 --> 03:02:26.478
Caption: areas and it goes into a lot more detail

03:02:24.478 --> 03:02:28.839
Caption: than what is possible in a talk so that

03:02:26.478 --> 03:02:30.559
Caption: can be useful for you as

03:02:28.839 --> 03:02:33.040
Caption: well

03:02:30.559 --> 03:02:34.879
Caption: so stan lee had a famous catchphrase he

03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:36.959
Caption: used to sign off letters and

03:02:34.879 --> 03:02:39.358
Caption: correspondence that he had with fans

03:02:36.959 --> 03:02:41.279
Caption: which was excelsior and as a little bit

03:02:39.359 --> 03:02:44.720
Caption: of a hat tip i thought it would be nice

03:02:41.279 --> 03:02:46.959
Caption: to include that in my talk as a closing

03:02:44.719 --> 03:02:49.120
Caption: he&#39;s had a great effect on many comic in

03:02:46.959 --> 03:02:51.919
Caption: uh sorry in many creative industries and

03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:53.359
Caption: but after looking up its meaning i sort

03:02:51.919 --> 03:02:54.879
Caption: of thought it was a really fantastic way

03:02:53.359 --> 03:02:57.040
Caption: to finish a talk

03:02:54.879 --> 03:02:58.559
Caption: excelsior stands for ever upwards so i

03:02:57.040 --> 03:03:00.479
Caption: think take what you learned from this

03:02:58.559 --> 03:03:02.719
Caption: talk and all the other great talks today

03:03:00.478 --> 03:03:04.799
Caption: and see how you can apply that to what

03:03:02.719 --> 03:03:07.519
Caption: you&#39;re working with

03:03:04.799 --> 03:03:07.519

Caption: i can&#39;t do any of their stuff on the web

03:03:43.519 --> 03:03:48.239
Caption: so i have a question

03:03:45.759 --> 03:03:50.000
Caption: what would you advise is the best

03:03:48.240 --> 03:03:53.279
Caption: approach to take for somebody new to

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:55.679
Caption: using something like css grid

03:03:53.279 --> 03:03:57.760
Caption: well i i mean what this is the way that

03:03:55.679 --> 03:04:01.199
Caption: i learned the css grid it was the talk

03:03:57.759 --> 03:04:02.799
Caption: is a little bit older now um

03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:05.040
Caption: but linking it with something that you

03:04:02.799 --> 03:04:05.759
Caption: enjoy i think is a good way to learn it

03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:07.679
Caption: i

03:04:05.759 --> 03:04:09.438
Caption: kind of knew some of these comics and

03:04:07.679 --> 03:04:13.040
Caption: and looked at the layouts and i was

03:04:09.439 --> 03:04:13.040
Caption: trying to use grid in products

03:04:13.200 --> 03:04:16.560
Caption: that designers would send me but it was

03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:18.479
Caption: always trying to visualize something

03:04:16.559 --> 03:04:20.000
Caption: that i didn&#39;t quite understand yet

03:04:18.478 --> 03:04:22.000
Caption: because the

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:24.399
Caption: the layouts that they were doing didn&#39;t

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:26.080
Caption: have these grids and these structures to

03:04:24.399 --> 03:04:28.399
Caption: it so taking a bit of a step back and

03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:30.000
Caption: starting to work with grid with comics

03:04:28.399 --> 03:04:31.040
Caption: in my case

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.959
Caption: uh

03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:35.279
Caption: was nice because it could start off

03:04:32.959 --> 03:04:37.679
Caption: quite simple and then build up to our

03:04:35.279 --> 03:04:40.160
Caption: more advanced

03:04:37.679 --> 03:04:41.599
Caption: examples with the

03:04:40.160 --> 03:04:43.759
Caption: sort of breaking out the boxes and

03:04:41.599 --> 03:04:44.879
Caption: starting to combine those techniques

03:04:43.759 --> 03:04:46.559
Caption: together

03:04:44.879 --> 03:04:49.519
Caption: so yeah i would say link it with

03:04:46.559 --> 03:04:50.799
Caption: something that you enjoy doing

03:04:49.519 --> 03:04:52.639
Caption: i think that&#39;s good advice for

03:04:50.799 --> 03:04:55.278
Caption: everything really

03:04:52.639 --> 03:04:57.040

04:52:33.199 --> 04:52:38.398
Caption: part of working in tech

04:52:35.279 --> 04:52:41.759

Caption: pop up seemingly from nowhere

04:52:44.240 --> 04:52:48.958

04:53:00.638 --> 04:53:06.798

04:53:06.798 --> 04:53:10.160

04:53:41.119 --> 04:53:44.478
Caption: and

04:53:41.919 --> 04:53:46.080
Caption: i&#39;m also on twitter i often fail to

04:53:44.480 --> 04:53:48.240
Caption: update this but you&#39;re welcome to follow

04:53:46.080 --> 04:53:50.878
Caption: me anyway

04:53:48.240 --> 04:53:53.439
Caption: now the benefit of me having worked in

04:53:50.878 --> 04:53:56.000
Caption: so many industries is that i&#39;ve seen

04:53:53.439 --> 04:53:57.679
Caption: what failure looks like across all kinds

04:53:56.000 --> 04:54:00.000
Caption: of projects

04:53:57.679 --> 04:54:02.560
Caption: and i can tell you that it&#39;s the same

04:54:00.000 --> 04:54:06.000
Caption: few things that cause a project of

04:54:02.560 --> 04:54:07.839
Caption: whatever kind to fail

04:54:06.000 --> 04:54:10.480
Caption: but one thing i can&#39;t fail to do today

04:54:07.839 --> 04:54:12.876
Caption: is to mention the amazing sponsors

04:54:10.480 --> 04:54:14.718
Caption: who make this possible um so if you

04:54:12.878 --> 04:54:16.958
Caption: haven&#39;t already please make sure you go

04:54:14.718 --> 04:54:19.521
Caption: get your treasure map stamped win some

04:54:16.957 --> 04:54:22.478
Caption: pretty cool stuff

04:54:19.519 --> 04:54:24.636
Caption: so today i&#39;m going to use a couple of

04:54:22.480 --> 04:54:26.560
Caption: examples from my personal life don&#39;t

04:54:24.638 --> 04:54:28.638
Caption: worry they are embarrassing

04:54:26.560 --> 04:54:32.160
Caption: to walk you through some of the mistakes

04:54:28.638 --> 04:54:35.759
Caption: that we made and how they can snowball

04:54:32.160 --> 04:54:35.759
Caption: into those big failures

04:54:35.919 --> 04:54:39.919
Caption: so i&#39;m gonna take you back a bit in my

04:54:37.679 --> 04:54:41.919
Caption: life to my childhood

04:54:39.919 --> 04:54:44.400
Caption: i&#39;m about five years old

04:54:41.919 --> 04:54:46.240
Caption: it&#39;s the start of term two and i&#39;m at a

04:54:44.400 --> 04:54:49.041
Caption: brand new school

04:54:46.240 --> 04:54:51.519
Caption: i&#39;m in the pre-primary class and i&#39;m

04:54:49.039 --> 04:54:53.439
Caption: standing at the starting line of the

04:54:51.519 --> 04:54:55.599
Caption: very first event of the day at our

04:54:53.439 --> 04:54:57.519
Caption: athletics carnival

04:54:55.599 --> 04:55:00.000
Caption: and then the sports teacher comes over

04:54:57.519 --> 04:55:01.279
Caption: to us and explains what this event&#39;s all

04:55:00.000 --> 04:55:03.839
Caption: about

04:55:01.279 --> 04:55:06.000
Caption: they tell us that what you need to do

04:55:03.839 --> 04:55:09.679
Caption: is to try and run and reach the finish

04:55:06.000 --> 04:55:10.638
Caption: line as fast as you possibly can

04:55:09.679 --> 04:55:12.320
Caption: now

04:55:10.638 --> 04:55:13.839
Caption: i&#39;ve been around the block a bit we&#39;re

04:55:12.320 --> 04:55:17.041
Caption: in the lead up to the sydney olympic

04:55:13.839 --> 04:55:18.957
Caption: games i&#39;ve seen a running race on tv

04:55:17.039 --> 04:55:21.519
Caption: i know exactly what it is that i&#39;m doing

04:55:18.957 --> 04:55:23.519
Caption: here right and i look down the track and

04:55:21.519 --> 04:55:25.839
Caption: i can see the finish lines in each of

04:55:23.519 --> 04:55:29.199
Caption: the lanes each with that finishing

04:55:25.839 --> 04:55:31.439
Caption: ribbon set across between the two posts

04:55:29.199 --> 04:55:33.359
Caption: so i think to myself yeah

04:55:31.439 --> 04:55:34.957
Caption: i&#39;ve got this and you know what i&#39;m

04:55:33.359 --> 04:55:38.558
Caption: going to show everyone at my new school

04:55:34.957 --> 04:55:38.558
Caption: that i am pretty cool

04:55:39.039 --> 04:55:42.876
Caption: so at the finish line

04:55:41.919 --> 04:55:43.839
Caption: ready

04:55:42.878 --> 04:55:45.121
Caption: set

04:55:43.839 --> 04:55:47.359
Caption: go

04:55:45.119 --> 04:55:50.318
Caption: and we&#39;re off we&#39;re running i&#39;m running

04:55:47.359 --> 04:55:52.160
Caption: as fast as my little legs can carry me

04:55:50.320 --> 04:55:53.281
Caption: and the finish line is very rapidly

04:55:52.160 --> 04:55:55.439
Caption: coming up

04:55:53.279 --> 04:55:58.160
Caption: i&#39;m gonna get there first i&#39;m gonna win

04:55:55.439 --> 04:55:59.679
Caption: this so i&#39;m running and i hit the finish

04:55:58.160 --> 04:56:02.718
Caption: line

04:55:59.679 --> 04:56:04.876
Caption: and i fall flat on my face

04:56:02.718 --> 04:56:06.839
Caption: you see what i thought was a set of

04:56:04.878 --> 04:56:09.601
Caption: finish lines turned out to be a set of

04:56:06.839 --> 04:56:11.519
Caption: hurdles and

04:56:09.599 --> 04:56:15.119
Caption: at five years old i hadn&#39;t encountered

04:56:11.519 --> 04:56:17.519
Caption: this before and not only did i fall down

04:56:15.119 --> 04:56:19.679
Caption: i caused a terrible domino effect

04:56:17.519 --> 04:56:21.679
Caption: children&#39;s limbs flying everywhere as

04:56:19.679 --> 04:56:25.119
Caption: the person next me fell down and

04:56:21.679 --> 04:56:27.519
Caption: cascaded down the lanes

04:56:25.119 --> 04:56:28.636
Caption: so where did i quite literally i might

04:56:27.519 --> 04:56:30.480
Caption: add

04:56:28.638 --> 04:56:33.201
Caption: fall down

04:56:30.480 --> 04:56:35.361
Caption: well it started with assumptions

04:56:33.199 --> 04:56:37.839
Caption: i assumed that because this looked

04:56:35.359 --> 04:56:39.919
Caption: similar to something that i&#39;d seen on tv

04:56:37.839 --> 04:56:42.796
Caption: that it must be the same

04:56:39.919 --> 04:56:45.119
Caption: and not only that the sports teacher

04:56:42.798 --> 04:56:47.361
Caption: assumed that everyone at that stand

04:56:45.119 --> 04:56:49.119
Caption: like that starting line had been there

04:56:47.359 --> 04:56:50.876
Caption: the term before

04:56:49.119 --> 04:56:52.957
Caption: and attended the class where we learned

04:56:50.878 --> 04:56:57.441
Caption: exactly what hurdles were and how to

04:56:52.957 --> 04:56:59.439
Caption: jump over them and not run through them

04:56:57.439 --> 04:57:00.957
Caption: the second mistake here was my own fear

04:56:59.439 --> 04:57:03.279
Caption: of embarrassment

04:57:00.957 --> 04:57:04.957
Caption: i was the new kid at school so even

04:57:03.279 --> 04:57:08.080
Caption: though i recognized this didn&#39;t look

04:57:04.957 --> 04:57:11.919
Caption: exactly the same to what i&#39;d seen on tv

04:57:08.080 --> 04:57:14.080
Caption: i was too scared to ask that question

04:57:11.919 --> 04:57:15.839
Caption: and thirdly there was some really poor

04:57:14.080 --> 04:57:18.400
Caption: communication

04:57:15.839 --> 04:57:20.240
Caption: when that sports teacher told us to run

04:57:18.400 --> 04:57:21.839
Caption: and try and reach the finish line as

04:57:20.240 --> 04:57:24.160
Caption: fast as possible

04:57:21.839 --> 04:57:28.080
Caption: did that really communicate what you

04:57:24.160 --> 04:57:28.080
Caption: needed to do in an event like hurdles

04:57:28.400 --> 04:57:32.798
Caption: and look it boils down to the fact that

04:57:30.400 --> 04:57:35.281
Caption: we didn&#39;t clearly communicate

04:57:32.798 --> 04:57:36.798
Caption: or understand the requirements

04:57:35.279 --> 04:57:38.318
Caption: and this isn&#39;t something that affects

04:57:36.798 --> 04:57:39.919
Caption: just me

04:57:38.320 --> 04:57:43.599
Caption: we see it every day

04:57:39.919 --> 04:57:45.839
Caption: the 125 million mars probe that failed

04:57:43.599 --> 04:57:47.519
Caption: because people assumed they were working

04:57:45.839 --> 04:57:49.519
Caption: in the same units

04:57:47.519 --> 04:57:52.240
Caption: or the junior developer who picks up a

04:57:49.519 --> 04:57:54.160
Caption: card for an api to do something

04:57:52.240 --> 04:57:56.160
Caption: and then they build it in java only to

04:57:54.160 --> 04:57:59.798
Caption: find out that hey it was meant to be

04:57:56.160 --> 04:57:59.798
Caption: built in c sharp

04:58:00.160 --> 04:58:06.160
Caption: so how do we avoid this

04:58:02.718 --> 04:58:08.160
Caption: firstly validate your assumptions check

04:58:06.160 --> 04:58:11.121
Caption: with your team members with your product

04:58:08.160 --> 04:58:14.798
Caption: donor or program manager and if possible

04:58:11.119 --> 04:58:17.039
Caption: with your stakeholders and end users

04:58:14.798 --> 04:58:18.958
Caption: ask the stupid questions don&#39;t be like

04:58:17.039 --> 04:58:21.359
Caption: me and let your fear of embarrassment

04:58:18.957 --> 04:58:22.876
Caption: get in the way of you asking a question

04:58:21.359 --> 04:58:24.876
Caption: because i can pretty much guarantee

04:58:22.878 --> 04:58:27.441
Caption: someone else in the team has the same

04:58:24.878 --> 04:58:29.601
Caption: thoughts as you

04:58:27.439 --> 04:58:31.919
Caption: and make sure that you have a shared

04:58:29.599 --> 04:58:34.636
Caption: understanding of what&#39;s required spend

04:58:31.919 --> 04:58:36.638
Caption: that bit of extra time in your inception

04:58:34.638 --> 04:58:39.041
Caption: and then document that for the next

04:58:36.638 --> 04:58:39.041
Caption: person

04:58:39.839 --> 04:58:43.759
Caption: moving on a little bit a little bit

04:58:41.599 --> 04:58:46.716
Caption: older a little bit wiser

04:58:43.759 --> 04:58:48.876
Caption: and i&#39;m in my final year of university

04:58:46.718 --> 04:58:52.000
Caption: i&#39;m working on my thesis which is

04:58:48.878 --> 04:58:53.681
Caption: investigating potential causes of liver

04:58:52.000 --> 04:58:55.759
Caption: disease

04:58:53.679 --> 04:58:58.240
Caption: now for anybody who&#39;s done biochemistry

04:58:55.759 --> 04:59:00.480
Caption: and seen diagrams like this before i

04:58:58.240 --> 04:59:02.080
Caption: apologize for reinflicting that trauma

04:59:00.480 --> 04:59:04.718
Caption: on you

04:59:02.080 --> 04:59:07.041
Caption: for everybody else i&#39;m going to try and

04:59:04.718 --> 04:59:09.601
Caption: explain what it is that i was working on

04:59:07.039 --> 04:59:12.636
Caption: without throwing too many terms like de

04:59:09.599 --> 04:59:15.439
Caption: novo lipogenesis or esterified fatty

04:59:12.638 --> 04:59:15.441
Caption: acids at you

04:59:15.919 --> 04:59:20.560
Caption: so the liver is the body&#39;s central hub

04:59:18.957 --> 04:59:23.279
Caption: for metabolism

04:59:20.560 --> 04:59:25.839
Caption: each one of the arrows on this diagram

04:59:23.279 --> 04:59:29.679
Caption: represents a pathway where something is

04:59:25.839 --> 04:59:32.876
Caption: metabolized from one thing to another

04:59:29.679 --> 04:59:34.560
Caption: for your context there&#39;s about 135 of

04:59:32.878 --> 04:59:36.638
Caption: them i cannot fit them all on one

04:59:34.560 --> 04:59:40.400
Caption: diagram

04:59:36.638 --> 04:59:41.919
Caption: but my team was invested in particularly

04:59:40.400 --> 04:59:43.679
Caption: two pathways

04:59:41.919 --> 04:59:46.560
Caption: we&#39;re looking at how the body breaks

04:59:43.679 --> 04:59:49.359
Caption: down fats and i was specifically

04:59:46.560 --> 04:59:51.759
Caption: focusing on how the body metabolizes

04:59:49.359 --> 04:59:55.199
Caption: iron and as a whole we&#39;re looking to see

04:59:51.759 --> 04:59:58.638
Caption: what happens between these two pathways

04:59:55.199 --> 04:59:58.636
Caption: when the liver gets stressed

04:59:58.718 --> 05:00:02.240
Caption: so

04:59:59.519 --> 05:00:04.160
Caption: for your understanding we selected our

05:00:02.240 --> 05:00:06.480
Caption: gene targets those the items that are

05:00:04.160 --> 05:00:08.638
Caption: sort of like boxed in blue

05:00:06.480 --> 05:00:11.121
Caption: very carefully

05:00:08.638 --> 05:00:12.878
Caption: we then determined what our experimental

05:00:11.119 --> 05:00:15.679
Caption: controls would be

05:00:12.878 --> 05:00:17.201
Caption: we worked very hard to ensure that we

05:00:15.679 --> 05:00:18.796
Caption: were using the same consistent

05:00:17.199 --> 05:00:21.359
Caption: methodology

05:00:18.798 --> 05:00:23.681
Caption: and then we got to work

05:00:21.359 --> 05:00:25.759
Caption: for three months we tested each of these

05:00:23.679 --> 05:00:27.359
Caption: targets and then we came together as a

05:00:25.759 --> 05:00:29.599
Caption: whole lab group

05:00:27.359 --> 05:00:30.957
Caption: to share sort of our version of a proof

05:00:29.599 --> 05:00:33.519
Caption: of concept

05:00:30.957 --> 05:00:35.119
Caption: and yeah all of the genes all of these

05:00:33.519 --> 05:00:36.957
Caption: things in blue

05:00:35.119 --> 05:00:39.119
Caption: were giving us the results that were

05:00:36.957 --> 05:00:41.119
Caption: expected the ones that we thought would

05:00:39.119 --> 05:00:42.796
Caption: be active were and the ones that we

05:00:41.119 --> 05:00:45.519
Caption: thought would be quiet

05:00:42.798 --> 05:00:48.798
Caption: weren&#39;t really showing us any results

05:00:45.519 --> 05:00:53.039
Caption: so we carried on with our work over the

05:00:48.798 --> 05:00:54.601
Caption: next 12 months i tested these targets so

05:00:53.039 --> 05:00:57.199
Caption: many times i

05:00:54.599 --> 05:01:01.359
Caption: painstakingly followed our protocols

05:00:57.199 --> 05:01:03.679
Caption: even down to like timing the seconds out

05:01:01.359 --> 05:01:06.636
Caption: and i honestly crunch more data than i

05:01:03.679 --> 05:01:09.359
Caption: think anybody knows what to do with

05:01:06.638 --> 05:01:11.839
Caption: and then at the end of 12 months we came

05:01:09.359 --> 05:01:13.839
Caption: together again each person who took a

05:01:11.839 --> 05:01:14.839
Caption: different pathway in the liver and

05:01:13.839 --> 05:01:18.160
Caption: shared our

05:01:14.839 --> 05:01:20.480
Caption: results the only problem was they didn&#39;t

05:01:18.160 --> 05:01:21.439
Caption: line up

05:01:20.480 --> 05:01:24.400
Caption: now

05:01:21.439 --> 05:01:27.119
Caption: as anybody who&#39;s been part of a software

05:01:24.400 --> 05:01:28.958
Caption: project maybe you&#39;ve dedicated a lot of

05:01:27.119 --> 05:01:32.478
Caption: time of your life to that and had it

05:01:28.957 --> 05:01:34.716
Caption: fall over or fail at the last minute

05:01:32.480 --> 05:01:37.361
Caption: realizing that your work

05:01:34.718 --> 05:01:38.958
Caption: for 12 months of your life

05:01:37.359 --> 05:01:41.119
Caption: was wasted

05:01:38.957 --> 05:01:43.599
Caption: that&#39;s a kick in the the guard that&#39;s a

05:01:41.119 --> 05:01:46.318
Caption: slap in the face and that&#39;s exactly how

05:01:43.599 --> 05:01:48.320
Caption: i was feeling when i found out that 12

05:01:46.320 --> 05:01:50.798
Caption: months of my life were effectively

05:01:48.320 --> 05:01:50.798
Caption: wasted

05:01:51.359 --> 05:01:55.039
Caption: effectively

05:01:53.679 --> 05:01:57.119
Caption: we failed

05:01:55.039 --> 05:01:59.439
Caption: to test everything that we should have

05:01:57.119 --> 05:02:01.519
Caption: so what didn&#39;t metabolize here in my

05:01:59.439 --> 05:02:04.478
Caption: piece of work

05:02:01.519 --> 05:02:06.480
Caption: well by only testing those gene targets

05:02:04.480 --> 05:02:08.160
Caption: in blue and not everything that was

05:02:06.480 --> 05:02:10.240
Caption: happening between them

05:02:08.160 --> 05:02:14.638
Caption: we relied on the equivalent of unit

05:02:10.240 --> 05:02:14.638
Caption: tests for an entire measure of quality

05:02:14.798 --> 05:02:19.281
Caption: and we didn&#39;t test the entire process

05:02:17.119 --> 05:02:22.080
Caption: end to end what happens between every

05:02:19.279 --> 05:02:24.398
Caption: single one of those 135 pathways in the

05:02:22.080 --> 05:02:26.560
Caption: liver so we didn&#39;t even have anything to

05:02:24.400 --> 05:02:28.718
Caption: compare the results that we did generate

05:02:26.560 --> 05:02:31.759
Caption: too

05:02:28.718 --> 05:02:33.121
Caption: and we only tested and planned for the

05:02:31.759 --> 05:02:34.638
Caption: happy path

05:02:33.119 --> 05:02:37.359
Caption: so what happens

05:02:34.638 --> 05:02:40.638
Caption: according to plan you know how the liver

05:02:37.359 --> 05:02:42.398
Caption: is meant to metabolize things and given

05:02:40.638 --> 05:02:44.718
Caption: that in this scenario we were

05:02:42.400 --> 05:02:47.281
Caption: deliberately trying to stress it to

05:02:44.718 --> 05:02:49.361
Caption: break down the metabolic processes

05:02:47.279 --> 05:02:52.240
Caption: we really should have considered that

05:02:49.359 --> 05:02:52.240
Caption: unhappy path

05:02:53.279 --> 05:02:57.279
Caption: we just simply didn&#39;t test everything

05:02:55.279 --> 05:02:58.957
Caption: that we needed to

05:02:57.279 --> 05:03:01.759
Caption: and look that isn&#39;t something that&#39;s

05:02:58.957 --> 05:03:04.158
Caption: just restricted to medical research

05:03:01.759 --> 05:03:06.320
Caption: inadequate testing also contributed to

05:03:04.160 --> 05:03:08.718
Caption: the failure of tsb banks software

05:03:06.320 --> 05:03:12.000
Caption: migration in 2018

05:03:08.718 --> 05:03:14.798
Caption: and that cost them 330 million pounds

05:03:12.000 --> 05:03:16.718
Caption: and lost them 80 000 customers

05:03:14.798 --> 05:03:19.441
Caption: so that&#39;s a pretty big mistake for not

05:03:16.718 --> 05:03:21.521
Caption: testing something

05:03:19.439 --> 05:03:24.957
Caption: so how do you get over this how do you

05:03:21.519 --> 05:03:27.679
Caption: overcome a lack of testing

05:03:24.957 --> 05:03:30.078
Caption: if at all possible consult the subject

05:03:27.679 --> 05:03:32.080
Caption: meta experts before you start your

05:03:30.080 --> 05:03:33.759
Caption: development work they can help you

05:03:32.080 --> 05:03:35.679
Caption: ensure that you&#39;re testing everything

05:03:33.759 --> 05:03:39.519
Caption: that you need to and that your

05:03:35.679 --> 05:03:42.560
Caption: development practices are robust

05:03:39.519 --> 05:03:44.240
Caption: please don&#39;t just rely on unit tests as

05:03:42.560 --> 05:03:46.718
Caption: foundational as

05:03:44.240 --> 05:03:49.041
Caption: important as they are if they&#39;re your

05:03:46.718 --> 05:03:50.718
Caption: only measure of quality you could be

05:03:49.039 --> 05:03:54.558
Caption: potentially missing something that will

05:03:50.718 --> 05:03:57.441
Caption: cause you an error or a bug later

05:03:54.560 --> 05:03:59.201
Caption: and consider the happy and the unhappy

05:03:57.439 --> 05:04:01.839
Caption: parts in your testing because we all

05:03:59.199 --> 05:04:04.636
Caption: know users i am a user and i know that i

05:04:01.839 --> 05:04:06.400
Caption: mistake make mistakes all of the time

05:04:04.638 --> 05:04:08.878
Caption: and i will find some way to break

05:04:06.400 --> 05:04:08.878
Caption: something

05:04:10.000 --> 05:04:15.759
Caption: now we come to the failure that frankly

05:04:13.359 --> 05:04:18.240
Caption: i&#39;m the most embarrassed about and the

05:04:15.759 --> 05:04:20.638
Caption: most mortified so guys strap yourselves

05:04:18.240 --> 05:04:23.519
Caption: in if you thought that was heavy

05:04:20.638 --> 05:04:26.240
Caption: you see i was asked to bake a cake

Caption: a hobby that i&#39;ve kept up for the past

05:05:17.039 --> 05:05:22.078
Caption: several years

05:05:18.638 --> 05:05:24.878
Caption: i&#39;ve baked everything from fully edible

05:05:22.080 --> 05:05:28.400
Caption: terrariums so i&#39;m talking candy glass

05:05:24.878 --> 05:05:30.080

Caption: things i&#39;ve even made cartoon character

05:05:37.679 --> 05:05:43.919
Caption: cakes before like finding dory or dory

05:05:42.320 --> 05:05:45.201
Caption: from finding nemo if you didn&#39;t see the

05:05:43.919 --> 05:05:46.080
Caption: sequel

05:05:45.199 --> 05:05:49.279
Caption: so

05:05:46.080 --> 05:05:51.519
Caption: making something like this amazing thing

05:05:49.279 --> 05:05:53.519
Caption: shouldn&#39;t be too far out of my

05:05:51.519 --> 05:05:54.839
Caption: wheelhouse right shouldn&#39;t be too far

05:05:53.519 --> 05:05:57.199
Caption: from my level of

05:05:54.839 --> 05:05:58.957
Caption: expertise so i did what anybody would do

05:05:57.199 --> 05:06:00.796
Caption: in this situation and i went hunting on

05:05:58.957 --> 05:06:03.039
Caption: the internet for inspiration this is

05:06:00.798 --> 05:06:04.240
Caption: just one of the items that i sort of

05:06:03.039 --> 05:06:05.839
Caption: like based

05:06:04.240 --> 05:06:07.439
Caption: my cake on

05:06:05.839 --> 05:06:08.320
Caption: i worked out everything that i would

05:06:07.439 --> 05:06:10.320
Caption: need

05:06:08.320 --> 05:06:11.839
Caption: and then i pre-ordered all of my

05:06:10.320 --> 05:06:13.919
Caption: ingredients all the things i&#39;d need for

05:06:11.839 --> 05:06:16.320
Caption: decoration

05:06:13.919 --> 05:06:18.957
Caption: fast forward a couple of weeks

05:06:16.320 --> 05:06:21.679
Caption: the day before the party and i finish

05:06:18.957 --> 05:06:23.679
Caption: work at lunchtime so i finish early

05:06:21.679 --> 05:06:25.839
Caption: and then i go down to collect everything

05:06:23.679 --> 05:06:27.759
Caption: that i&#39;d pre-ordered

05:06:25.839 --> 05:06:29.199
Caption: only problem was they didn&#39;t have half

05:06:27.759 --> 05:06:31.359
Caption: the stuff i ordered

05:06:29.199 --> 05:06:32.957
Caption: including the cake that i special

05:06:31.359 --> 05:06:33.919
Caption: ordered

05:06:32.957 --> 05:06:36.318
Caption: so

05:06:33.919 --> 05:06:38.480
Caption: with very few options you know i&#39;m a day

05:06:36.320 --> 05:06:39.359
Caption: away from this party

05:06:38.480 --> 05:06:41.599
Caption: i

05:06:39.359 --> 05:06:44.000
Caption: had to come up with another solution

05:06:41.599 --> 05:06:46.080
Caption: so i came up with a list of things that

05:06:44.000 --> 05:06:48.080
Caption: i thought i could substitute in terms of

05:06:46.080 --> 05:06:50.798
Caption: ingredients i grabbed everything that i

05:06:48.080 --> 05:06:53.519
Caption: would need to bake cakes myself and i

05:06:50.798 --> 05:06:57.041
Caption: headed home and got baking

05:06:53.519 --> 05:06:59.439
Caption: i just pulled the cakes out of the oven

05:06:57.039 --> 05:07:02.000
Caption: when i got a phone call from the other

05:06:59.439 --> 05:07:04.876
Caption: person organizing the party asking me to

05:07:02.000 --> 05:07:06.798
Caption: do them just a little favor and could i

05:07:04.878 --> 05:07:09.201
Caption: run down and pick up

05:07:06.798 --> 05:07:11.361
Caption: the guy&#39;s birthday present

05:07:09.199 --> 05:07:13.359
Caption: now cakes have to cool after coming out

05:07:11.359 --> 05:07:15.519
Caption: of the oven and i definitely can&#39;t start

05:07:13.359 --> 05:07:16.716
Caption: carving them up or decorating them until

05:07:15.519 --> 05:07:18.160
Caption: that&#39;s done

05:07:16.718 --> 05:07:22.480
Caption: and i don&#39;t know if you guys know this

05:07:18.160 --> 05:07:23.519
Caption: but birthday presents kind of a big deal

05:07:22.480 --> 05:07:25.519
Caption: so

05:07:23.519 --> 05:07:27.919
Caption: sure

05:07:25.519 --> 05:07:30.400
Caption: but as anybody who works in perth cbd

05:07:27.919 --> 05:07:31.839
Caption: knows that on a friday afternoon peak

05:07:30.400 --> 05:07:33.439
Caption: hour traffic

05:07:31.839 --> 05:07:36.638
Caption: is insane

05:07:33.439 --> 05:07:39.519
Caption: so my quick errand quickly turned into a

05:07:36.638 --> 05:07:41.441
Caption: three-hour long trip

05:07:39.519 --> 05:07:44.160
Caption: and that meant that i just didn&#39;t have

05:07:41.439 --> 05:07:47.199
Caption: the time that i needed that evening to

05:07:44.160 --> 05:07:49.439
Caption: start assembling this cake

05:07:47.199 --> 05:07:52.080
Caption: no problem i wake up even earlier the

05:07:49.439 --> 05:07:54.080
Caption: next morning i get slicing my cake down

05:07:52.080 --> 05:07:56.240
Caption: into all the shapes that i need i start

05:07:54.080 --> 05:07:57.759
Caption: getting ready to assemble it

05:07:56.240 --> 05:07:59.759
Caption: only to sort of get tapped on the

05:07:57.759 --> 05:08:02.716
Caption: shoulder and told you know that we&#39;re

05:07:59.759 --> 05:08:05.199
Caption: hosting this party right so we need to

05:08:02.718 --> 05:08:07.839
Caption: start setting up at about mid afternoon

05:08:05.199 --> 05:08:12.238
Caption: and you need to go get ready

05:08:07.839 --> 05:08:14.400
Caption: so i&#39;m looking at my half assembled cake

05:08:12.240 --> 05:08:16.638
Caption: and i know that it&#39;s gonna take me at

05:08:14.400 --> 05:08:18.878
Caption: least another eight hours to finish

05:08:16.638 --> 05:08:21.441
Caption: assembling this especially given i&#39;m

05:08:18.878 --> 05:08:24.160
Caption: working with things that i am not

05:08:21.439 --> 05:08:25.599
Caption: familiar with

05:08:24.160 --> 05:08:28.958
Caption: so

05:08:25.599 --> 05:08:28.957
Caption: something had to give

05:08:29.119 --> 05:08:34.158
Caption: i decided i had to start from scratch i

05:08:31.599 --> 05:08:38.000
Caption: rebaked some cakes

05:08:34.160 --> 05:08:40.240
Caption: and here&#39;s what i was able to deliver

05:08:38.000 --> 05:08:43.039
Caption: in a little bit over four hours i

05:08:40.240 --> 05:08:44.638
Caption: completely rebaked cakes and i decorated

05:08:43.039 --> 05:08:46.558
Caption: now look

05:08:44.638 --> 05:08:47.919
Caption: it kind of it&#39;s the minimum viable

05:08:46.560 --> 05:08:49.281
Caption: product right

05:08:47.919 --> 05:08:52.000
Caption: it&#39;s a cake

05:08:49.279 --> 05:08:55.279
Caption: it kind of resembles king julien on it

05:08:52.000 --> 05:08:57.519
Caption: and look when i cut cut it open you know

05:08:55.279 --> 05:08:58.876
Caption: the stuff did spill out like a pinata

05:08:57.519 --> 05:09:00.957
Caption: cake

05:08:58.878 --> 05:09:02.798
Caption: but it wasn&#39;t even close to what i

05:09:00.957 --> 05:09:05.279
Caption: wanted to deliver it wasn&#39;t sort of what

05:09:02.798 --> 05:09:07.441
Caption: we promised and it definitely wasn&#39;t

05:09:05.279 --> 05:09:09.279
Caption: like this image which is what i was

05:09:07.439 --> 05:09:11.119
Caption: aiming for

05:09:09.279 --> 05:09:12.876
Caption: so i was still understandably

05:09:11.119 --> 05:09:15.119
Caption: embarrassed and yet here i am sharing it

05:09:12.878 --> 05:09:17.041
Caption: all with you guys

05:09:15.119 --> 05:09:19.119
Caption: so how did i

05:09:17.039 --> 05:09:20.318
Caption: somebody who&#39;s got years of experience

05:09:19.119 --> 05:09:24.158
Caption: with baking

05:09:20.320 --> 05:09:25.519
Caption: become a nail bit contender

05:09:24.160 --> 05:09:27.839
Caption: well

05:09:25.519 --> 05:09:29.919
Caption: the resources and tools that i planned

05:09:27.839 --> 05:09:32.560
Caption: on having ingredients i was familiar

05:09:29.919 --> 05:09:36.160
Caption: with pre-made cakes so i could focus on

05:09:32.560 --> 05:09:38.320
Caption: decorating had to be substituted

05:09:36.160 --> 05:09:40.958
Caption: the organizer didn&#39;t consider

05:09:38.320 --> 05:09:43.281
Caption: conflicting priorities i mean yeah a

05:09:40.957 --> 05:09:46.078
Caption: birthday present&#39;s important but so is

05:09:43.279 --> 05:09:47.599
Caption: the birthday cake and realistically i

05:09:46.080 --> 05:09:49.919
Caption: should have pushed back on me being the

05:09:47.599 --> 05:09:52.240
Caption: person to pick it up surely someone else

05:09:49.919 --> 05:09:55.359
Caption: could have

05:09:52.240 --> 05:09:58.480
Caption: and i also failed to plan for changes in

05:09:55.359 --> 05:09:59.919
Caption: my own capacity or for these unexpected

05:09:58.480 --> 05:10:03.281
Caption: things to happen i could have allowed

05:09:59.919 --> 05:10:03.279
Caption: myself even more time

05:10:03.439 --> 05:10:08.558
Caption: at the end it just came down to pool

05:10:05.199 --> 05:10:11.839
Caption: planning now this is a contributor to 71

05:10:08.560 --> 05:10:13.441
Caption: of pro projects that fail so it&#39;s a big

05:10:11.839 --> 05:10:14.400
Caption: one

05:10:13.439 --> 05:10:17.599
Caption: and look

05:10:14.400 --> 05:10:19.519
Caption: it&#39;s not just related to bank to baking

05:10:17.599 --> 05:10:23.039
Caption: or anything else like that

05:10:19.519 --> 05:10:24.240
Caption: poor planning caused a three-time cost

05:10:23.039 --> 05:10:28.000
Caption: overrun

05:10:24.240 --> 05:10:31.679
Caption: for the u.s national gas companies erp

05:10:28.000 --> 05:10:33.519
Caption: update so they originally budgeted 330

05:10:31.679 --> 05:10:35.279
Caption: million dollars and it cost them just

05:10:33.519 --> 05:10:37.919
Caption: over a billion

05:10:35.279 --> 05:10:39.599
Caption: to finish that project

05:10:37.919 --> 05:10:41.919
Caption: that&#39;s a lot of money could have been

05:10:39.599 --> 05:10:44.320
Caption: spent elsewhere

05:10:41.919 --> 05:10:46.080
Caption: so how do we avoid becoming nailed at

05:10:44.320 --> 05:10:48.638
Caption: contenders

05:10:46.080 --> 05:10:52.000
Caption: if at all possible get your stakeholders

05:10:48.638 --> 05:10:54.320
Caption: your party planners involved early and

05:10:52.000 --> 05:10:56.320
Caption: make sure that you are on the same page

05:10:54.320 --> 05:10:57.439
Caption: when it comes to what needs to be

05:10:56.320 --> 05:10:59.599
Caption: delivered

05:10:57.439 --> 05:11:01.439
Caption: when

05:10:59.599 --> 05:11:04.320
Caption: plan ahead

05:11:01.439 --> 05:11:06.000
Caption: for rework for unexpected tools and

05:11:04.320 --> 05:11:07.919
Caption: changes in your team and your own

05:11:06.000 --> 05:11:10.480
Caption: capacity

05:11:07.919 --> 05:11:13.359
Caption: deliver your minimum viable product and

05:11:10.480 --> 05:11:15.919
Caption: then continue to improve on it if at all

05:11:13.359 --> 05:11:15.919
Caption: possible

05:11:16.240 --> 05:11:19.201
Caption: so

05:11:17.119 --> 05:11:21.839
Caption: how do we learn from my mistakes i mean

05:11:19.199 --> 05:11:24.238
Caption: failure is inevitable sometimes it&#39;s a

05:11:21.839 --> 05:11:26.080
Caption: big part of life it&#39;s part of developing

05:11:24.240 --> 05:11:28.560
Caption: software

05:11:26.080 --> 05:11:30.638
Caption: but you know those small mistakes that

05:11:28.560 --> 05:11:33.919
Caption: i&#39;ve made along the way that doesn&#39;t

05:11:30.638 --> 05:11:36.240
Caption: have to snowball into a massive failure

05:11:33.919 --> 05:11:37.759
Caption: so if you can ask yourself these couple

05:11:36.240 --> 05:11:40.718
Caption: of questions the next time you&#39;re

05:11:37.759 --> 05:11:43.599
Caption: working on a software project

05:11:40.718 --> 05:11:47.041
Caption: are we all on the same page and is our

05:11:43.599 --> 05:11:49.519
Caption: understanding documented

05:11:47.039 --> 05:11:52.796
Caption: have we considered all parts in our

05:11:49.519 --> 05:11:54.957
Caption: development and our testing

05:11:52.798 --> 05:11:55.841
Caption: and have we planned for when things go

05:11:54.957 --> 05:11:58.839
Caption: wrong

05:11:55.839 --> 05:12:02.160
Caption: and is there a contingency plan in

05:11:58.839 --> 05:12:03.679
Caption: place if you can answer yes to these

05:12:02.160 --> 05:12:05.041
Caption: three questions

05:12:03.679 --> 05:12:07.279
Caption: then you would have at least learned

05:12:05.039 --> 05:12:10.519
Caption: from my mistakes

05:12:07.279 --> 05:12:10.519
