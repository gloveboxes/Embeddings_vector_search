Caption: la sesiÃ³n before lunch we need to learn

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:49.540
Caption: about from Dylan in de sorry

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:53.860
Caption: ah that&#39;s right all right so right so go

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:57.489
Caption: my I mean I was a junior developer bank

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.779
Caption: best or two maybe three years and I

00:00:57.488 --> 00:01:00.779
Caption: spent a lot of lifetime networking

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.440
Caption: I then very quickly realized that

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.119
Caption: breaking things was a lot more fun than

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.220
Caption: building them so this is more active

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.360
Caption: what I do now having penetration Festa

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.360
Caption: of a receive you

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:20.819
Caption: but that&#39;s always they don&#39;t get told

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:26.739
Caption: you about today I&#39;m gonna talk about

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:28.690
Caption: fashion beside myself and a friend of

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:31.029
Caption: mine we maintained quite a lot yeah

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.090
Caption: great outside the patient will evoke med

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:36.309
Caption: school we&#39;ve been doing this for five

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:39.819
Caption: years now and we were very early

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:41.829
Caption: adopters for both react every noise as

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:46.690
Caption: part of that I&#39;ve written a lot of

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.720
Caption: JavaScript so that&#39;s just a bit

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.760
Caption: background around me one thing I really

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.610
Caption: enjoy doing is trying out different

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.130
Caption: programming language just like any five

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.319
Caption: I see it up open a new language or a new

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:01.930
Caption: framework I&#39;m immediately right in there

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.849
Caption: checking it out seeing what pages the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.400
Caption: language has to offer and you know what

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:09.369
Caption: gauges language past years of law school

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.830
Caption: and you know about a week maybe couple

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.080
Caption: of months but eventually all have to

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.820
Caption: move on front and I kind of go back to

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.669
Caption: my day to day which is most niche novice

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:22.870
Caption: prepositional call that even he doesn&#39;t

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:24.220
Caption: do anything in production with these I

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.139
Caption: still think there&#39;s a lot of value in

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.720
Caption: trying them out right because they all

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.910
Caption: but emphasis is on different aspects of

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.860
Caption: software and even if you just try them

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.660
Caption: you be more aware of those things when

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.699
Caption: you go back to alexei secretary lovely

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.580
Caption: rust there&#39;s a language which has a big

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:46.029
Caption: focus on this idea of memory safety kind

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.130
Caption: of memory ownership so if you&#39;ve got a

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:49.988
Caption: lot of rust under that the job obviously

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.750
Caption: Java memory is all handled for you by

00:02:49.988 --> 00:02:54.639
Caption: the runtime however often purva trust

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.738
Caption: you be more aware about how you would

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:59.679
Caption: using memories with any program and kind

00:02:56.738 --> 00:03:01.270
Caption: of hypoxia gramma and well those off the

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.039
Caption: garbage collection hence to where it&#39;s

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.529
Caption: at

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:06.360
Caption: and currency issues and things like that

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:09.328
Caption: pastels of the big one thing I used to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.199
Caption: run a lot of Pascal the ire of many of

00:03:09.328 --> 00:03:16.009
Caption: my friends and colleagues and a scalpel

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:18.238
Caption: is a huge focus on this idea of

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.889
Caption: encapsulating side effects and kind of

00:03:18.238 --> 00:03:22.708
Caption: minimizing to state so it wants to be a

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.089
Caption: very same language so after writing has

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:27.029
Caption: gone for several months I eventually

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:29.309
Caption: went back to stay shop at this station

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:32.039
Caption: off I was not writing was much more

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.539
Caption: functional you know I was trying to run

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:35.878
Caption: my code in the way which we minimize the

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:37.469
Caption: side effects of path and another nice

00:03:35.878 --> 00:03:39.628
Caption: result of this was the trade-off nail

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.029
Caption: writing was so much easier to test

00:03:39.628 --> 00:03:43.768
Caption: because of this and I may have reached

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:45.628
Caption: the same conclusion if I was banging my

00:03:43.768 --> 00:03:47.339
Caption: head against about men you know six

00:03:45.628 --> 00:03:49.108
Caption: months but I feel like trying something

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:52.319
Caption: that was story different really

00:03:49.108 --> 00:03:55.858
Caption: accelerated that loading process is

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.779
Caption: really a little bit better so languages

00:03:55.858 --> 00:04:00.899
Caption: which quote my life was a little foreign

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:03.509
Caption: language called L so L was a functional

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:06.659
Caption: language and framework for doing single

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:15.418
Caption: page kind of this in the same spaces

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:17.429
Caption: angular react five years ago and this

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.109
Caption: was very much under peak of annual one

00:04:17.429 --> 00:04:20.669
Caption: like annual one was people going to be

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.369
Caption: kind of framework for Billy&#39;s web

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.740
Caption: applications reactant is just like this

00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:27.929
Caption: very early releases I was the mitigating

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:30.989
Caption: fraction but it was still very much it

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:33.079
Caption: was a paramount angular world so a big

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:36.619
Caption: company was really nice product a little

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:38.869
Caption: I really enjoyable I guarantee no

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:41.750
Caption: runtime exceptions a nice refreshing

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:44.959
Caption: change from JavaScript runtime

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.408
Caption: exceptions yeah that I was trying to

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:50.809
Caption: language out and it looked quickly asked

00:04:48.408 --> 00:04:52.639
Caption: next to it was even earlier element it

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:54.829
Caption: was for react to the times the certain

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.860
Caption: aspects of the language which was a bit

00:04:54.829 --> 00:04:59.598
Caption: difficult so you know I tried it couple

00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:01.638
Caption: things but I&#39;ve actually had to put it

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:05.329
Caption: down and I&#39;ve moved on and became a

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.250
Caption: react developer redox came out it go

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:12.348
Caption: through state management library for

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:15.709
Caption: react Docs is heavily inspired by Holmes

00:05:12.348 --> 00:05:17.089
Caption: burger that like this kind of went on

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:18.799
Caption: and then check back in with Ellen kind

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:22.579
Caption: of you know those major release for

00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:25.638
Caption: someone didn&#39;t go on it either check it

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:28.039
Caption: out and see what had changed in the

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.389
Caption: language and with its release it got

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.509
Caption: more and more polished and it eventually

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.919
Caption: got the finalist two years ago replica

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.750
Caption: you know what the nothing&#39;s changed in

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.000
Caption: his time for me to pick it up and kind

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.190
Caption: of see what&#39;s changing I&#39;m actually use

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.649
Caption: this out and it was like it was nice and

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.690
Caption: I tried I think I had out all the issues

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:47.269
Caption: I have the language he just became a

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.860
Caption: really pleasant experience and it was a

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:50.448
Caption: really refreshing change because by this

00:05:48.859 --> 00:05:52.908
Caption: point I&#39;ve been running reactant

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.979
Caption: production for like three years and I&#39;ve

00:05:52.908 --> 00:05:56.899
Caption: written so much JavaScript minutes ago

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:57.889
Caption: so it&#39;s time to get really frustrating I

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:02.929
Caption: feel do different

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:06.080
Caption: I feel like it&#39;s a really important

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:08.449
Caption: language whereas own puts a lot of focus

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:10.638
Caption: on name develops friendly and I think

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.559
Caption: this is really interesting right so we

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.248
Caption: have been multiple folks in today rate

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:17.748
Caption: but we will dis focus on user experience

00:06:15.248 --> 00:06:19.369
Caption: we build the best user experience for

00:06:17.748 --> 00:06:21.408
Caption: our customers we want to write software

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:23.329
Caption: is easy to use and friendly and

00:06:21.408 --> 00:06:25.759
Caption: intuitive to find all these things right

00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:27.168
Caption: how it really feels like the tools and

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:29.028
Caption: languages we use are stealth

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.899
Caption: this is kind of push to the back of our

00:06:29.028 --> 00:06:34.729
Caption: minds like it&#39;s not not really a concern

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:36.589
Caption: I think that&#39;s really sad like we have

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:44.569
Caption: to use this stuff and yeah it should be

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:46.609
Caption: as much he is I want to talk to you

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.528
Caption: about today I wanna share with you some

00:06:46.609 --> 00:06:54.978
Caption: of my frustrations with the cardboards

00:06:48.528 --> 00:06:56.388
Caption: web development I&#39;m gonna talk about and

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.669
Caption: then we&#39;ll finish up with a bit of live

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.110
Caption: project because I think any tool or I

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.028
Caption: chose to try to sell you a programming

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:03.728
Caption: language might actually use it and it is

00:07:02.028 --> 00:07:07.369
Caption: gonna be a bit of a letdown

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:11.929
Caption: so I with all that said let&#39;s poke about

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:15.289
Caption: JavaScript said Java scripts are really

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:17.449
Caption: strange language right like I know I

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:20.889
Caption: think people better say that it was

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.889
Caption: designed in 10 days

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:26.850
Caption: I don&#39;t know whether or not that&#39;s true

00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:28.889
Caption: but I think we can hold it great that

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.220
Caption: wasn&#39;t intended for building large

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:35.699
Caption: scalloped edges used - like a little

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.739
Caption: descriptive browser which is really

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:39.239
Caption: weird because you know idle this went

00:07:37.739 --> 00:07:41.190
Caption: down using it to build thousand lines

00:07:39.239 --> 00:07:43.649
Caption: single page applications we&#39;re running

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:46.319
Caption: it on the back end enjoyed a srt8 in

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:47.309
Caption: service environments like AWS they

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:49.319
Caption: wasn&#39;t paying attention

00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:50.789
Caption: the art himself recently announced that

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:52.259
Caption: you can write Excel macros and

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:54.869
Caption: JavaScript as well which is fantastic

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:56.880
Caption: for me as an investor because making

00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:59.609
Caption: malicious documents with experience

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.660
Caption: between of the odds I really appreciate

00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:05.219
Caption: that pretty close so yeah despite you

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.539
Caption: know this kind of meet your eyes the

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.940
Caption: language itself is actually really weird

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:11.639
Caption: like people these with various like it&#39;s

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:14.399
Caption: up to equality operators or either the

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:15.570
Caption: whole promise callback event loop type

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:18.809
Caption: thing that I&#39;ve got a lot of people

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:20.220
Caption: virtually understand and this is all

00:08:18.809 --> 00:08:22.019
Caption: you&#39;ve come to these things quite early

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.819
Caption: on which is with because JavaScript I

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:26.000
Caption: think it&#39;s safe to say it&#39;s the lowest

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:29.098
Caption: price entry of any programming language

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.720
Caption: like every web browser including a

00:08:29.098 --> 00:08:32.848
Caption: JavaScript console in the JavaScript

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.700
Caption: rebel I can tell my grandma right that

00:08:32.848 --> 00:08:37.440
Caption: right now today to press f12 and she

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.278
Caption: could be upgrading javascript in like

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.289
Caption: five minutes

00:08:38.278 --> 00:08:43.078
Caption: present my house to could go and run a

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:45.778
Caption: Java program to be like download the JDK

00:08:43.078 --> 00:08:47.609
Caption: from articles most likely but it&#39;s still

00:08:45.778 --> 00:08:50.778
Caption: in a happy boba and then you want to

00:08:47.609 --> 00:08:50.778
Caption: exit out of that

00:08:52.289 --> 00:08:55.449
Caption: it&#39;s all about surprise it&#39;s really

00:08:54.729 --> 00:08:57.489
Caption: complicated

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:06.400
Caption: where&#39;s the JavaScript it&#39;s like button

00:08:57.489 --> 00:09:08.229
Caption: and everyone can do this so it&#39;s really

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.029
Caption: strange about this - no very dangerous

00:09:08.229 --> 00:09:12.639
Caption: go to the course other quarks are being

00:09:10.028 --> 00:09:14.020
Caption: dynamically typed and kind of like

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.270
Caption: implicitly converting things to

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.160
Caption: different folks a couple of additions

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:23.350
Caption: that obviously gives you a runtime error

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:25.419
Caption: is especially valuable then you get into

00:09:23.349 --> 00:09:32.919
Caption: the whole backs process event look by

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:35.349
Caption: still develop this works this is fairly

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:39.669
Caption: trivial to solve it otherwise it wasn&#39;t

00:09:35.349 --> 00:09:41.979
Caption: running it&#39;s very strange and then we

00:09:39.669 --> 00:09:43.899
Caption: get into the build tools I&#39;ve never been

00:09:41.979 --> 00:09:46.028
Caption: more frustrated than configuring jobs

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:49.510
Caption: for the build tools every six months is

00:09:46.028 --> 00:09:52.390
Caption: a new one and they&#39;re all terrible

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:54.400
Caption: and then finally JavaScript has well it

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.970
Caption: does not stand it up refill offended by

00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:01.930
Caption: because not the full function so that&#39;s

00:09:56.969 --> 00:10:05.759
Caption: that vm that paddle from a year ago with

00:10:01.929 --> 00:10:05.760
Caption: someone who&#39;s the package from India

00:10:13.549 --> 00:11:35.789
Caption: so is undefined

00:11:32.969 --> 00:11:37.769
Caption: hell no man asleep a very good solution

00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:40.649
Caption: at main job the language it is

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:47.730
Caption: today so Java sir had one of them

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:50.010
Caption: include notes next example we&#39;ve got to

00:11:47.729 --> 00:11:52.109
Caption: empty arrays and I try to add them

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.640
Caption: together they obviously this would make

00:11:52.109 --> 00:11:55.380
Caption: any sense does make sense to add rice

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.880
Caption: there should be a pair of the Java

00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:00.059
Caption: scripts gonna let us do it anything

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.130
Caption: I suppose and movingly we could say that

00:12:00.059 --> 00:12:04.469
Caption: addition of arrays is under black

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.609
Caption: concatenation in which case if you can

00:12:04.469 --> 00:12:07.349
Caption: can&#39;t get to it if you&#39;re right

00:12:05.609 --> 00:12:10.459
Caption: obviously you&#39;ve got another name if

00:12:07.349 --> 00:12:15.029
Caption: you&#39;re right I&#39;m gonna take this to go

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:26.429
Caption: check go check let&#39;s try to get the

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:30.060
Caption: empty string is definitely a five so by

00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:35.250
Caption: adding the empty object to the NVRA and

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:37.529
Caption: guess what we get in this case zero even

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.150
Caption: the string object object that&#39;s not like

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:42.390
Caption: a queue special value that&#39;s literally a

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:49.110
Caption: stranger those letters that makes

00:12:42.390 --> 00:13:03.059
Caption: perfect sense initiative as you can swap

00:12:49.109 --> 00:13:04.529
Caption: the arguments now we have the object you

00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:06.059
Caption: get the number zero so we don&#39;t think of

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:09.420
Caption: returning strings anymore I don&#39;t

00:13:06.059 --> 00:13:11.820
Caption: completely different was fantastic I got

00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:13.169
Caption: the two more examples this one is real

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.710
Caption: awesome professional JavaScript

00:13:13.169 --> 00:13:15.709
Caption: developer this

00:13:33.919 --> 00:14:16.649
Caption: it&#39;s the water cha this is so much more

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.510
Caption: so got yes sex with a baby we&#39;ve got

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.550
Caption: polyfills we&#39;ve got immediately invoked

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.290
Caption: function expressions we&#39;ve got fetch

00:14:20.549 --> 00:14:24.869
Caption: we&#39;ve got asynchronous one that is

00:14:22.289 --> 00:14:26.909
Caption: consistent as common has browserify

00:14:24.869 --> 00:14:28.739
Caption: I still don&#39;t fully understand browser

00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:30.809
Caption: public engagement once it was something

00:14:28.739 --> 00:14:32.190
Caption: about impact isn&#39;t the problem

00:14:30.809 --> 00:14:34.619
Caption: I don&#39;t know why you needed it but it

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:36.119
Caption: was there right your uncle web pack each

00:14:34.619 --> 00:14:38.119
Caption: of these build tools is better than the

00:14:36.119 --> 00:14:40.890
Caption: previous one by some arbitrary metric

00:14:38.119 --> 00:14:42.570
Caption: we&#39;ve got cool backs and promises then

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.520
Caption: we get up in games brightest package

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.400
Caption: manager ability said wasn&#39;t so we were

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.170
Caption: young it&#39;s a better package manager this

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:52.250
Caption: is what javascript is like right so

00:14:49.169 --> 00:14:52.250
Caption: where this leave us

00:14:53.229 --> 00:14:59.709
Caption: that leaves me really frustrated like I

00:14:56.979 --> 00:15:04.209
Caption: have to write and maintain more tests

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:06.340
Caption: and spending time debugging runtime

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:08.740
Caption: errors will often result just from this

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.600
Caption: simple timeline obviously up of more

00:15:08.739 --> 00:15:12.940
Caption: dependencies we&#39;ve all seen a node

00:15:10.599 --> 00:15:15.459
Caption: modules all right you know the hundreds

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:34.220
Caption: of thousands of dependent packages for

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:35.369
Caption: really simple application and enough

00:15:34.219 --> 00:15:39.939
Caption: [Music]

00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:43.210
Caption: language instead of like oh crap oh and

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:45.760
Caption: how I think it does things silencer so

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:48.910
Caption: as I said before almost a language which

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:52.570
Caption: compiles down to Java scripting language

00:15:48.909 --> 00:15:54.489
Caption: and lives in the same spaces it has a

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.650
Caption: fairly decent standard library and built

00:15:54.489 --> 00:15:58.630
Caption: into it like strangers have left and

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:01.630
Caption: right type functions so we&#39;re already

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:04.809
Caption: one step above JavaScript that it&#39;s also

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:06.849
Caption: got full charge of inter operation and

00:16:04.809 --> 00:16:08.200
Caption: this is really nice if you&#39;re trying to

00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:11.229
Caption: integrate now into an existing

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.540
Caption: application you can essentially convert

00:16:11.229 --> 00:16:16.320
Caption: both data between your existing

00:16:13.539 --> 00:16:16.320
Caption: application and

00:16:18.549 --> 00:16:22.369
Caption: but there are a few areas where I think

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:25.068
Caption: only really shines and the first of

00:16:22.369 --> 00:16:28.730
Caption: those domain is type system so it&#39;s

00:16:25.068 --> 00:16:30.708
Caption: strongly and statically type and this is

00:16:28.729 --> 00:16:32.508
Caption: it and provided a number of guarantees

00:16:30.708 --> 00:16:34.938
Caption: basically eliminates the whole Austin

00:16:32.508 --> 00:16:38.268
Caption: Powers right and it&#39;s through this pot

00:16:34.939 --> 00:16:40.309
Caption: system that let me say about the node

00:16:38.268 --> 00:16:41.958
Caption: runtime exception and this is a hundred

00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:42.889
Caption: percent true of my experience I we&#39;re

00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.979
Caption: gonna break a lot of it at this point

00:16:42.888 --> 00:16:54.828
Caption: and I still have one spot of exception

00:16:45.979 --> 00:16:56.808
Caption: I&#39;m going to think obviously with static

00:16:54.828 --> 00:17:00.888
Caption: types and their own conceptions we&#39;ve

00:16:56.809 --> 00:17:02.389
Caption: got more compiler errors but all tags

00:17:00.888 --> 00:17:04.308
Caption: are really interesting approach to this

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:06.048
Caption: because usually to a bar letter is it

00:17:04.308 --> 00:17:08.538
Caption: still feels let people to write compile

00:17:06.048 --> 00:17:10.398
Caption: this is the 80s or even earlier but you

00:17:08.538 --> 00:17:13.668
Caption: just get some kind of cryptic error code

00:17:10.399 --> 00:17:15.829
Caption: or a boyfriend so this can be really

00:17:13.668 --> 00:17:18.349
Caption: frustrating particularly in languages

00:17:15.828 --> 00:17:19.609
Caption: like Java a scholar tools to have very

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:21.768
Caption: strict splat systems

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:24.109
Caption: well than it could feel like you all

00:17:21.769 --> 00:17:26.109
Caption: fighting the compiler preventing you

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:29.058
Caption: from doing what that equals very

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:31.038
Caption: classrooms approach that this is a penny

00:17:29.058 --> 00:17:33.739
Caption: the fire effects that focused on just

00:17:31.038 --> 00:17:36.079
Caption: making the co-pilot Armas is as simple

00:17:33.739 --> 00:17:38.630
Caption: and easy to read as possible and they

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:41.510
Caption: really truly uh probably know just the

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:43.339
Caption: best errors I&#39;ve seen the best pairs of

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:47.769
Caption: any software I&#39;ve ever used

00:17:43.339 --> 00:17:47.768
Caption: like it&#39;s really amazing how helpful

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.200
Caption: the next thing that happens is again

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.630
Caption: something I haven&#39;t seen in another

00:17:53.199 --> 00:17:58.659
Caption: language it can enforce semantic

00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:01.449
Caption: versioning of packages so if you try to

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:04.000
Caption: push the package and know all your

00:18:01.449 --> 00:18:05.919
Caption: change has a breaking API change for

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.319
Caption: example if you change the type signature

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.000
Caption: of one of the functions in your package

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:12.069
Caption: obviously you&#39;re going to break people

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.630
Caption: that use them that back your friends

00:18:12.069 --> 00:18:14.889
Caption: they get a pull your change and their

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.270
Caption: codes don&#39;t know we&#39;re going to compile

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.040
Caption: because the types are different

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.540
Caption: so what Mel does in this case is it

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.489
Caption: forces you to make that the major

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.500
Caption: version bubble because the package men

00:18:21.489 --> 00:18:25.719
Caption: from the compiler work together to

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.030
Caption: ensure that guarantee of everything is

00:18:25.719 --> 00:18:30.369
Caption: correct and this is again something I&#39;ve

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.750
Caption: seen in on languages and it&#39;s really

00:18:30.369 --> 00:18:33.550
Caption: reassuring if you&#39;re performing in

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.410
Caption: operated one of your dependencies you

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:37.150
Caption: see it&#39;s a minor version change you know

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:39.729
Caption: you can just pull it straight into your

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:47.320
Caption: application and you&#39;re gonna be writing

00:18:39.729 --> 00:18:49.780
Caption: anything much I&#39;m evil still and lastly

00:18:47.319 --> 00:18:52.389
Caption: the velocity really trying to spell made

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.920
Caption: this pact that it includes the building

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:57.070
Caption: application is called a known

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:59.770
Caption: architecture so this is just kind of

00:18:57.069 --> 00:19:02.139
Caption: booming these are interfaces one of the

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:10.330
Caption: big inspirations for redux for those of

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:13.209
Caption: you familiar with that and it&#39;s just so

00:19:10.329 --> 00:19:14.589
Caption: that&#39;s not that I want to go into get

00:19:13.209 --> 00:19:17.939
Caption: more detail that&#39;s when the pipe system

00:19:14.589 --> 00:19:17.939
Caption: stuff how many photos

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.940
Caption: I love repo protectionist a problem idea

00:19:23.099 --> 00:19:31.020
Caption: out west

00:19:23.939 --> 00:19:33.179
Caption: Richmond and then we&#39;ll do it so I think

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.558
Caption: we can all agree that skydiving is good

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.990
Caption: but especially for building large

00:19:34.558 --> 00:19:41.010
Caption: applications I mean that&#39;s why I skirt

00:19:36.989 --> 00:19:44.609
Caption: is as popular that is and as I said

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:49.589
Caption: before elmo is from latest static in a

00:19:44.609 --> 00:19:52.349
Caption: way that is alien to us both I&#39;ve been

00:19:49.589 --> 00:19:54.329
Caption: Princeton essentially get away with

00:19:52.349 --> 00:19:57.030
Caption: watching your code and never have to

00:19:54.329 --> 00:19:59.760
Caption: specify copilot we just kind of figure

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.530
Caption: out what high school good using and I

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.979
Caption: just barreled up for you so you can

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:07.170
Caption: actually write like you&#39;re running jobs

00:20:04.979 --> 00:20:09.178
Caption: you never have to run but you still get

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:12.989
Caption: that safety than the time system

00:20:09.178 --> 00:20:15.589
Caption: provides home also goes one step further

00:20:12.989 --> 00:20:17.280
Caption: than other statically typed languages

00:20:15.589 --> 00:20:21.049
Caption: shopping job

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:23.670
Caption: so element doesn&#39;t include any multi

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:25.890
Caption: role where it&#39;s at least because most of

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:28.800
Caption: my issues with say Chopin Java is null

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.270
Caption: pointer exception they kind of just a

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.220
Caption: cold that shouldn&#39;t exist right

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:40.290
Caption: and so eliminates this might enjoy

00:20:32.219 --> 00:20:41.849
Caption: putting those and obviously I think the

00:20:52.530 --> 00:21:01.190
Caption: yeah and it&#39;s through this this also

00:20:58.319 --> 00:21:03.509
Caption: makes refactoring like really nice right

00:21:01.189 --> 00:21:05.489
Caption: because come to the fact that the

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.810
Caption: compiler error message is so helpful if

00:21:05.489 --> 00:21:09.780
Caption: you wanted to a great factor I don&#39;t

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:13.670
Caption: know we need do is make go read back

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:16.260
Caption: that what the compiler messages and then

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:29.910
Caption: let&#39;s take up a little bit figure out

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:33.180
Caption: right this is really so an example of

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:35.880
Caption: this was before I decided to pick up an

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:40.380
Caption: old project I kind of dropped about nine

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:41.729
Caption: months and I realized when I fixed it up

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.719
Caption: there and let that each a hop

00:21:41.729 --> 00:21:48.599
Caption: implemented and say you know I closed

00:21:45.719 --> 00:21:51.390
Caption: the repo I had a look around trying to

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:53.459
Caption: figure out what I was doing where I was

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:58.200
Caption: in a program and implemented the

00:21:53.459 --> 00:22:00.839
Caption: functionality so it actually took me ten

00:21:58.199 --> 00:22:03.269
Caption: minutes to remember what I was doing a

00:22:00.839 --> 00:22:05.159
Caption: great familiarize myself with it and

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.570
Caption: then I spent maybe another ten fifteen

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.840
Caption: minutes actually coding off the rest of

00:22:06.569 --> 00:22:13.019
Caption: the paycheck and I&#39;ve got a lot more

00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:14.849
Caption: errands tonight normally would I make a

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:17.130
Caption: change and then the compiler tiger hey

00:22:14.849 --> 00:22:22.699
Caption: names what thickness over here or any

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:25.140
Caption: content is here as well and so

00:22:22.699 --> 00:22:27.000
Caption: end-to-end thanks to the compiler in

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.829
Caption: this pipe standing I was a believer from

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.819
Caption: not seeing that both

00:22:28.829 --> 00:22:34.819
Caption: but nine months to completing the finish

00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:45.690
Caption: my bread is never soft and you&#39;ll be a

00:22:45.058 --> 00:22:47.038
Caption: lot

00:22:45.689 --> 00:22:49.859
Caption: well obvious if I just walked you

00:22:47.038 --> 00:22:53.278
Caption: through a couple of them for a couple of

00:22:49.859 --> 00:22:54.719
Caption: assists this is the best one so what

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:56.789
Caption: we&#39;ve got here is we&#39;ve used an

00:22:54.719 --> 00:22:59.459
Caption: expression which is kind of like return

00:22:56.788 --> 00:23:03.839
Caption: rate but we return different values from

00:22:59.459 --> 00:23:05.250
Caption: each of the branches so the reason this

00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:07.168
Caption: is an error is because we&#39;re assigning

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.729
Caption: it to a variable we don&#39;t know what the

00:23:07.168 --> 00:23:12.048
Caption: resulting talk with that variable is it

00:23:08.729 --> 00:23:23.158
Caption: might be straight or I&#39;m getting normal

00:23:12.048 --> 00:23:27.168
Caption: so basically best case we bucket is the

00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:27.169
Caption: actual file and it&#39;s causing the issues

00:23:32.928 --> 00:23:37.048
Caption: then we have the actual error itself

00:23:35.308 --> 00:23:39.839
Caption: smooth on the branches of this it

00:23:37.048 --> 00:23:41.459
Caption: produced different types of values again

00:23:39.839 --> 00:23:44.099
Caption: I feel this is pretty standard but I

00:23:41.459 --> 00:23:48.048
Caption: think it does a little bit better that

00:23:44.099 --> 00:23:48.048
Caption: this is an actual English

00:23:48.558 --> 00:23:52.589
Caption: very easy graded on this end

00:23:50.939 --> 00:23:54.178
Caption: the only another language is he muskeg

00:23:52.589 --> 00:23:56.428
Caption: Paulo was right not a type mismatch

00:23:54.178 --> 00:24:00.029
Caption: arrow something my eldest being a little

00:23:56.428 --> 00:24:02.819
Caption: polite Aaron actually English then

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:06.059
Caption: moving on we&#39;ve got again the Len number

00:24:02.819 --> 00:24:08.759
Caption: which is but actually because one step

00:24:06.058 --> 00:24:11.279
Caption: ahead includes the actual offending line

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.750
Caption: that is causing the error and the lows

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.059
Caption: the whole one in this money that&#39;s just

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:16.739
Caption: part of the line it will on the line and

00:24:15.058 --> 00:24:19.709
Caption: friends what the actual part of it is

00:24:16.739 --> 00:24:21.359
Caption: that&#39;s holding an issue and this is

00:24:19.709 --> 00:24:22.979
Caption: fantastic right because this makes I can

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:24.270
Caption: just look at this era and then jump

00:24:22.979 --> 00:24:25.918
Caption: straight back to the code nice to know

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:30.089
Caption: what I need to change and where what the

00:24:25.918 --> 00:24:31.619
Caption: issue is rather than just gave a line of

00:24:30.089 --> 00:24:33.928
Caption: it maybe like a ball stand in the line

00:24:31.619 --> 00:24:39.178
Caption: of monthly how many times I&#39;ve got that

00:24:33.928 --> 00:24:41.130
Caption: offset and end up either left my cursor

00:24:39.178 --> 00:24:42.569
Caption: through that I figure out where in the

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.880
Caption: line I&#39;m actually made a mistake right

00:24:42.569 --> 00:24:49.288
Caption: well the whole thing&#39;s right know

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:53.659
Caption: exactly what the next section is we get

00:24:49.288 --> 00:24:53.658
Caption: actual types which I miss matching then

00:24:55.428 --> 00:25:02.579
Caption: again you kind of get this one step

00:25:00.989 --> 00:25:04.260
Caption: further it tells you which branches with

00:25:02.579 --> 00:25:06.298
Caption: you might and although in this example

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.829
Caption: is perhaps most important see very

00:25:06.298 --> 00:25:13.229
Caption: clearly stated how the world is the

00:25:07.829 --> 00:25:14.760
Caption: string is what like 90 values and we

00:25:13.229 --> 00:25:16.709
Caption: were calling other functions in these

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.320
Caption: branches and then will be immediately

00:25:16.709 --> 00:25:23.359
Caption: obvious which which which branches

00:25:19.319 --> 00:25:23.359
Caption: mismatching or which types or at any

00:25:24.109 --> 00:25:28.469
Caption: point any kind of the icing on the cake

00:25:26.099 --> 00:25:30.630
Caption: is always began one step per that

00:25:28.469 --> 00:25:33.939
Caption: provides this extra hint which is these

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:36.500
Caption: need to match so we

00:25:33.939 --> 00:25:37.519
Caption: this is really nice right comes the

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.560
Caption: composite or anything close to what

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.209
Caption: we&#39;ve done wrong bed Tiger officials

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.640
Caption: impose why that&#39;s a problem

00:25:41.209 --> 00:25:49.969
Caption: that&#39;s okay really feel that that level

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:53.750
Caption: of context is not provided in next

00:25:49.969 --> 00:25:56.630
Caption: example we&#39;ve made it by foot over there

00:25:53.750 --> 00:26:03.979
Caption: and I&#39;m trying to access the field on

00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:06.829
Caption: that variable first name again moving to

00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:09.469
Caption: write Alice&#39;s because then the stuntman

00:26:06.829 --> 00:26:14.059
Caption: again well in plain English really easy

00:26:09.469 --> 00:26:15.650
Caption: to understand and I variable again we

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.380
Caption: get the line on that any extra any

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:22.700
Caption: parties and other lines we don&#39;t exact

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:24.520
Caption: equations but the actual driver as well

00:26:22.699 --> 00:26:27.000
Caption: so we don&#39;t have a palace it&#39;s a person

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:30.369
Caption: does not come and go

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.439
Caption: does this whole belly stretch boy go

00:26:30.369 --> 00:26:34.719
Caption: back home because one step further again

00:26:32.439 --> 00:26:36.699
Caption: is it from Isis extra hint which is the

00:26:34.719 --> 00:26:39.369
Caption: record fields to not jump maybe you make

00:26:36.699 --> 00:26:42.099
Caption: these five of us so the person doesn&#39;t

00:26:39.369 --> 00:26:45.130
Caption: lose it&#39;ll call first there a typical

00:26:42.099 --> 00:26:47.349
Caption: dose this he&#39;s trying to access to the

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:50.069
Caption: server man and this person and you can

00:26:47.349 --> 00:26:54.900
Caption: see that these people

00:26:50.069 --> 00:27:04.630
Caption: flex it but so it&#39;s like maybe you&#39;ve

00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:06.520
Caption: never seen this final example we&#39;ve got

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:13.839
Caption: the right people they know about first

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:14.979
Caption: name but the lost operator and Ellen is

00:27:13.839 --> 00:27:16.359
Caption: terrific for numbers

00:27:14.979 --> 00:27:18.010
Caption: you don&#39;t use it the string

00:27:16.359 --> 00:27:21.130
Caption: concatenation because we&#39;ve all seen how

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:22.300
Caption: bad they like message JavaScript so

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:27.670
Caption: again we get the line number and

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:30.220
Caption: underline that doesn&#39;t match plus is

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:33.420
Caption: expecting the left argument to be the

00:27:30.219 --> 00:27:36.039
Caption: argument is a string again what&#39;s this

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:43.450
Caption: extra Hindi goken strings that no

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:46.090
Caption: mediate you so this is amazing not only

00:27:43.449 --> 00:27:48.130
Caption: does it detected positive type error mr.

00:27:46.089 --> 00:27:50.260
Caption: any exists train with a bus operator but

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.640
Caption: at those that it&#39;s a string he&#39;s using

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.589
Caption: an applause all right you must be trying

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.239
Caption: to append strings but I will provide

00:27:53.589 --> 00:27:56.770
Caption: this extra in but you know it&#39;s actually

00:27:55.239 --> 00:27:59.499
Caption: append strings you need to use this

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:03.979
Caption: other operator here&#39;s the document

00:27:59.499 --> 00:28:07.519
Caption: and again I&#39;ve never seen this in any

00:28:03.979 --> 00:28:11.569
Caption: other language it&#39;s really nice just a

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:14.690
Caption: really pleasant developer experience

00:28:11.569 --> 00:28:16.158
Caption: yeah so that&#39;s kind of an example of

00:28:14.689 --> 00:28:18.018
Caption: some of the papyrus is happening to

00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:22.429
Caption: raise data that it&#39;s so much better than

00:28:18.019 --> 00:28:23.838
Caption: the other error messages in place this

00:28:22.428 --> 00:28:26.268
Caption: is definitely one of the wise Grunfeld

00:28:23.838 --> 00:28:33.468
Caption: own pushes for a better user experience

00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:37.009
Caption: arrangements really is the old

00:28:33.468 --> 00:28:40.119
Caption: architecture so it&#39;s a pattern book but

00:28:37.009 --> 00:28:44.859
Caption: we have the pensions in Nome it&#39;s Bailey

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:44.859
Caption: haven&#39;t integrated with the language but

00:28:45.338 --> 00:28:55.158
Caption: it&#39;s you know all the articles and

00:28:47.538 --> 00:28:57.408
Caption: tutorials use it&#39;s easy to use as I said

00:28:55.159 --> 00:29:00.919
Caption: before it&#39;s a relapse for those of you

00:28:57.409 --> 00:29:07.789
Caption: who use that library and it&#39;s it&#39;s very

00:29:00.918 --> 00:29:11.108
Caption: easy to use is this idea of going in one

00:29:07.788 --> 00:29:11.108
Caption: direction and this makes it really easy

00:29:18.428 --> 00:29:23.448
Caption: so this is the entire space of your

00:29:21.229 --> 00:29:26.558
Caption: application this includes all things

00:29:23.448 --> 00:29:31.338
Caption: like any thought of loaded pro it guys

00:29:26.558 --> 00:29:33.288
Caption: us stay in this problem and having this

00:29:31.338 --> 00:29:37.908
Caption: whole lot that&#39;s really great because it

00:29:33.288 --> 00:29:40.878
Caption: means not only it&#39;s also very easy to do

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:44.119
Caption: to test the people so what you can do is

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:48.909
Caption: you can export this as a JSON object or

00:29:44.119 --> 00:29:48.909
Caption: a test value and basically is important

00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:53.149
Caption: so if you put a test them and the tester

00:29:51.468 --> 00:29:56.359
Caption: funds the feedback been in your software

00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:58.039
Caption: that has been exported that model and

00:29:56.359 --> 00:29:59.298
Caption: use the developer can just import it

00:29:58.038 --> 00:30:07.638
Caption: back into your program and you can be

00:29:59.298 --> 00:30:10.189
Caption: that the exact same the next component

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:12.409
Caption: is the view so this is fairly

00:30:10.189 --> 00:30:14.689
Caption: straightforward the view is basically a

00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:17.619
Caption: function which takes a model and just

00:30:14.689 --> 00:30:19.908
Caption: returns HTML or draws it to the screen

00:30:17.619 --> 00:30:23.239
Caption: there&#39;s really a lot of magic going on

00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:24.919
Caption: there it uses a virtual Dom doing all

00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:34.940
Caption: this rendering much the same way that

00:30:24.918 --> 00:30:38.648
Caption: reactors you know lonely update and this

00:30:34.939 --> 00:30:38.648
Caption: is where the of your budget

00:30:39.579 --> 00:30:54.369
Caption: you handle a couple&#39;s so thanks messages

00:30:50.089 --> 00:30:56.989
Caption: from the view messages can basically be

00:30:54.369 --> 00:30:58.969
Caption: anything from the Thomas inch base coats

00:30:56.989 --> 00:31:01.219
Caption: like the user clicks on a button or they

00:30:58.969 --> 00:31:03.319
Caption: try some meaningful field these will

00:31:01.219 --> 00:31:06.589
Caption: generate messages but also the non

00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:17.630
Caption: interactive events like an API call

00:31:06.589 --> 00:31:20.599
Caption: completes that message the second thing

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:22.819
Caption: in thanks is the particle so with these

00:31:20.599 --> 00:31:25.969
Caption: two pieces of information update

00:31:22.819 --> 00:31:28.489
Caption: function unless it&#39;s out you know so I

00:31:25.969 --> 00:31:29.449
Caption: say they use Eclipse a toggle that

00:31:28.489 --> 00:31:31.309
Caption: message we&#39;re going to the update

00:31:29.449 --> 00:31:34.369
Caption: function will go into the update

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:39.020
Caption: function will change the model and tweak

00:31:34.369 --> 00:31:40.550
Caption: the state of that and then you know the

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:42.589
Caption: Yvonne will flow into the view will

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:47.750
Caption: figure a redraw and the motorcycle -

00:31:42.589 --> 00:31:49.760
Caption: completes right so this really this

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:51.109
Caption: pattern is really sort of pulling it&#39;ll

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.750
Caption: plus another version that&#39;s your great

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:55.640
Caption: way to write you eyes even outside of my

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:58.699
Caption: use this pack of JavaScript code is

00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:01.489
Caption: commanding user and I built I think it&#39;s

00:31:58.699 --> 00:32:03.319
Caption: really read all of these components that

00:32:01.489 --> 00:32:05.540
Caption: completely stateless which makes them

00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:07.459
Caption: really easy to test like the views only

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:10.250
Caption: dependencies it&#39;s just a function that

00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:12.649
Caption: takes one argument but it&#39;s too crazy to

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:14.180
Caption: test that and same day it takes both the

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.900
Caption: argument depends on obviously

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:19.020
Caption: interesting piece in isolation

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:21.450
Caption: really obvious places illness and

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:23.729
Caption: functional language and this is a

00:32:21.449 --> 00:32:26.939
Caption: functional path that go they kind of gel

00:32:23.729 --> 00:32:48.290
Caption: together really nice in a way that Redux

00:32:26.939 --> 00:32:48.289
Caption: I feel doesn&#39;t gel with and I can

00:32:58.038 --> 00:33:05.009
Caption: hey go so this is an online American

00:33:03.329 --> 00:33:11.250
Caption: preference for humbling those that&#39;s

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:17.280
Caption: right you know you got stuff in here

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:21.928
Caption: compiled so the stuff you like actually

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:23.400
Caption: draw something so HTML packaged and we

00:33:21.928 --> 00:33:25.229
Caption: use this exposes an ex that basically

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.089
Caption: just means employed every information

00:33:25.229 --> 00:33:42.418
Caption: you know

00:33:26.089 --> 00:33:43.689
Caption: and then we have a main function of X

00:33:42.418 --> 00:33:46.738
Caption: it&#39;s going to color it

00:33:43.689 --> 00:33:46.738
Caption: [Music]

00:33:47.788 --> 00:33:58.439
Caption: so the first function definition

00:33:50.030 --> 00:34:01.229
Caption: application and then you provide as a

00:33:58.439 --> 00:34:02.939
Caption: separated list of arguments in an equal

00:34:01.229 --> 00:34:06.140
Caption: time and in the body of your options

00:34:02.939 --> 00:34:06.139
Caption: there&#39;s no parentheses here

00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:28.799
Caption: [Music]

00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:45.799
Caption: so maybe not be found at how about we&#39;ll

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:47.510
Caption: do some conditional stuff right so I&#39;m

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.630
Caption: gonna write a function thanks clover

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:53.110
Caption: Katzman it&#39;s not a message about whether

00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:53.109
Caption: love you

00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:04.729
Caption: someone said about 70 I feel like

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:22.340
Caption: because to me that&#39;s way before

00:35:04.729 --> 00:35:25.760
Caption: reasonable suggestion 11 cats that&#39;s

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:28.899
Caption: greater than 2 and we just immediately

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.898
Caption: [Music]

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:59.449
Caption: else brunch good so let&#39;s actually run

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:59.449
Caption: best dish

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:12.439
Caption: you never know one of them otherwise Oh

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.270
Caption: it was quickly going to list since

00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:24.630
Caption: accident you get into doing some more

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:26.520
Caption: HTML and interactivity up stuff listen

00:36:24.629 --> 00:36:31.879
Caption: to nil basically the same as JavaScript

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.880
Caption: you just use square brackets

00:36:37.489 --> 00:36:42.719
Caption: yeah pretty stressful with I feel like

00:36:39.689 --> 00:36:49.199
Caption: this kind of you know this we can do to

00:36:42.719 --> 00:36:51.059
Caption: string and print Paulus this printed and

00:36:49.199 --> 00:36:54.739
Caption: here&#39;s actually printed the list itself

00:36:51.059 --> 00:36:54.739
Caption: so that&#39;s why it goes this way

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:13.930
Caption: positive effects function that I guess

00:37:09.689 --> 00:37:16.239
Caption: it&#39;s all fairly straightforward right so

00:37:13.929 --> 00:37:18.969
Caption: well that they said let&#39;s do some actual

00:37:16.239 --> 00:37:21.669
Caption: HTML and good programming here so we

00:37:18.969 --> 00:37:23.859
Caption: have a div and we&#39;re going to give it a

00:37:21.669 --> 00:37:25.809
Caption: list of attributes supposed to be like

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:30.700
Caption: HTML attributes in this case I&#39;m just

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:32.820
Caption: gonna give it and then the second thing

00:37:30.699 --> 00:37:49.449
Caption: you give it is a list of Charlie with us

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:51.190
Caption: it will do h1 say yeah I feel like this

00:37:49.449 --> 00:37:53.349
Caption: index is probably one of the more

00:37:51.189 --> 00:37:57.010
Caption: different things about writing HTML in

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:59.680
Caption: this way there are like transpilers and

00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:02.649
Caption: that&#39;s writing the more reactive angle

00:37:59.679 --> 00:38:13.559
Caption: bracket style but honestly you do very

00:38:02.649 --> 00:38:13.559
Caption: quickly get used to this Thanks

00:38:17.159 --> 00:38:21.459
Caption: to pets

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:23.679
Caption: hello a day to day throughout to cats

00:38:21.459 --> 00:38:27.939
Caption: that the appropriate number of cats for

00:38:23.679 --> 00:38:29.889
Caption: the girlfriends yes this is all class

00:38:27.939 --> 00:38:32.169
Caption: ready board right but we still don&#39;t

00:38:29.889 --> 00:38:36.578
Caption: have any activity and we also haven&#39;t

00:38:32.169 --> 00:39:17.139
Caption: started using me home so to do that we

00:38:36.579 --> 00:39:19.450
Caption: need this is really easy this is similar

00:39:17.139 --> 00:39:22.529
Caption: the object syntax in in JavaScript so in

00:39:19.449 --> 00:39:22.530
Caption: JavaScript you thought about that

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.219
Caption: and actually test this already without

00:39:27.389 --> 00:39:38.069
Caption: the hola protection if I just spend you

00:39:29.219 --> 00:39:41.219
Caption: and me so I put the final component we

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:55.229
Caption: need is our function as I said before

00:39:41.219 --> 00:39:56.669
Caption: text message so now with these great

00:39:55.229 --> 00:39:59.369
Caption: things what we need to do is wire them

00:39:56.669 --> 00:40:01.409
Caption: together oh my good to go set up a

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:03.090
Caption: function to do this cross cooking in a

00:40:01.409 --> 00:40:06.629
Caption: program you basically just give it the

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:09.739
Caption: view model update function and it will

00:40:06.629 --> 00:40:09.739
Caption: make sure that everything

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:35.489
Caption: goats are awful and live together no

00:40:23.889 --> 00:40:40.589
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s interactivity this cats

00:40:35.489 --> 00:40:40.590
Caption: basically interchangeable even in solo

00:40:41.919 --> 00:40:45.959
Caption: so the buttons render but obviously

00:40:43.959 --> 00:40:49.899
Caption: they&#39;re not generating any actions right

00:40:45.959 --> 00:40:54.270
Caption: so anytime normally end up close so that

00:40:49.899 --> 00:40:54.270
Caption: lives in the package

00:41:08.159 --> 00:41:12.159
Caption: all still works that we&#39;re not handle

00:41:10.719 --> 00:41:14.590
Caption: this event so there&#39;s events and going

00:41:12.159 --> 00:41:16.119
Caption: in tomorrow that function County M that

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:21.880
Caption: since I&#39;m an ocean is into anything that

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:25.830
Caption: handle those so and eleven these various

00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:25.829
Caption: and lead to the messages

00:41:26.629 --> 00:41:29.708
Caption: [Music]

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:21.020
Caption: [Applause]

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.938
Caption: [Music]

00:42:52.780 --> 00:43:02.580
Caption: just get rid of all this anyone&#39;s a

00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:02.580
Caption: problem in this long for exactly right

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:06.730
Caption: yeah

00:43:03.939 --> 00:43:08.319
Caption: so now since we&#39;re using strings is

00:43:06.729 --> 00:43:10.959
Caption: possibly we pass a strain that as an

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.699
Caption: adult will sell and in that case it can

00:43:10.959 --> 00:43:15.239
Caption: be a runtime a proxy because Ellen

00:43:12.699 --> 00:43:18.879
Caption: doesn&#39;t know what to do in that case

00:43:15.239 --> 00:43:20.860
Caption: so fortunately detect this as provide us

00:43:18.879 --> 00:43:22.389
Caption: a really helpful our best engine so

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:25.030
Caption: we&#39;ve got checks the case payment

00:43:22.389 --> 00:43:41.709
Caption: handles or branches we save the strings

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:43.570
Caption: we need to accommodate for the site but

00:43:41.709 --> 00:43:45.070
Caption: again this is a bit there&#39;s still some

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:48.010
Caption: problems to this right because if we

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:50.380
Caption: make it perfect you know it&#39;s stupid in

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:53.130
Caption: compiler as as far as Ellen&#39;s case and

00:43:50.379 --> 00:43:53.129
Caption: yet we clearly have

00:43:58.709 --> 00:44:02.379
Caption: so really what we want is we don&#39;t use

00:44:00.879 --> 00:44:05.169
Caption: strings for these messages probably want

00:44:02.379 --> 00:44:08.259
Caption: to use like an enum where union time so

00:44:05.169 --> 00:44:10.298
Caption: that&#39;s just a type message and the

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:11.559
Caption: message can find the bait an adult will

00:44:10.299 --> 00:44:13.569
Caption: sell pretty straightforward right you

00:44:11.559 --> 00:44:16.959
Caption: can have as many of these MS o&#39;clock and

00:44:13.569 --> 00:44:20.859
Caption: then this is full so they only talk by a

00:44:16.959 --> 00:44:23.049
Caption: correction type in this entire demo so

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:29.429
Caption: now what we need to do is we just each

00:44:23.049 --> 00:44:34.359
Caption: of these two and obviously if we make

00:44:29.429 --> 00:44:39.250
Caption: one of these composite you&#39;ve tried to

00:44:34.358 --> 00:44:41.949
Caption: be so but again keeping our both lanes

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:43.750
Caption: detected another era since the right now

00:44:41.949 --> 00:44:45.760
Caption: passing through this enum type you can

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:47.919
Caption: only be and also sell so we don&#39;t

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.449
Caption: actually need this default because there

00:44:47.919 --> 00:44:51.929
Caption: is no default case but handling very

00:44:49.449 --> 00:44:51.929
Caption: possible

00:44:56.899 --> 00:45:01.449
Caption: Google&#39;s so that&#39;s the demo of this

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:22.679
Caption: that&#39;s all for me that&#39;s a bit of a

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:26.939
Caption: taste of something to call the caterer

00:45:22.679 --> 00:45:31.020
Caption: out there obviously I feel like pulling

00:45:26.939 --> 00:45:33.810
Caption: into funny conference is different

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:35.909
Caption: people I hope you already see how smooth

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:37.590
Caption: it is that&#39;s really nice there is there

00:45:35.909 --> 00:45:42.059
Caption: it really helped discover a lot of

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:44.180
Caption: things we know this is all thanks to you

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.180
Caption: know

00:45:49.689 --> 00:45:51.750
Caption: you

00:47:15.739 --> 00:47:21.299
Caption: really provides peace of mind and

00:47:19.199 --> 00:47:25.019
Caption: confidence with your riding apartments a

00:47:21.299 --> 00:47:26.459
Caption: really fun experience obviously you have

00:47:25.019 --> 00:47:28.469
Caption: to write a lot less tests right the

00:47:26.459 --> 00:47:34.289
Caption: composite catch me so many cases for you

00:47:28.469 --> 00:47:36.719
Caption: you can have a much smaller really we

00:47:34.289 --> 00:47:38.430
Caption: also saw how polite that requires it and

00:47:36.719 --> 00:47:40.348
Caption: this isn&#39;t something I mentioned earlier

00:47:38.429 --> 00:47:42.568
Caption: but like all the tools in the own

00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:45.240
Caption: ecosystem have this kind of politeness

00:47:42.569 --> 00:47:48.359
Caption: to them like the package manager doesn&#39;t

00:47:45.239 --> 00:47:51.358
Caption: say install package yn is what they call

00:47:48.358 --> 00:47:54.598
Caption: this a beautiful it doesn&#39;t sound like

00:47:51.358 --> 00:47:59.629
Caption: life but I think it&#39;s nice system

00:47:54.599 --> 00:47:59.630
Caption: architecture there it is the other

00:48:03.769 --> 00:48:08.910
Caption: inspired you to give Elmo good like I

00:48:07.469 --> 00:48:10.529
Caption: said before like you don&#39;t need to be

00:48:08.909 --> 00:48:12.568
Caption: using this tape reduction to benefit

00:48:10.529 --> 00:48:14.039
Caption: from it even if you just you know give

00:48:12.569 --> 00:48:16.710
Caption: it a go and learn to write things in a

00:48:14.039 --> 00:48:18.150
Caption: more functional and testable style you

00:48:16.709 --> 00:48:20.039
Caption: just push for a better developer

00:48:18.149 --> 00:48:21.808
Caption: experience from from your tools and your

00:48:20.039 --> 00:48:24.479
Caption: languages I think that would be enough

00:48:21.809 --> 00:48:26.219
Caption: like everything has to be world-changing

00:48:24.479 --> 00:48:31.199
Caption: sometimes it really is just about the

00:48:26.219 --> 00:48:32.909
Caption: little things those are links so

00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:35.068
Caption: obviously don&#39;t let go go slash try this

00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:38.098
Caption: I was using for the demo if you want

00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:39.690
Caption: look at that well it includes that
