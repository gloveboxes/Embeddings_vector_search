Caption: DDD Perth he&#39;s passionate about clean

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:33.360
Caption: and structured code web standards

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:36.659
Caption: accessibility and optimization and Anton

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.840

Caption: Anton co-organizers fenders front and

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:49.799
Caption: developer meetups and as I said DDD

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.058
Caption: Perth he&#39;s also volunteered as a mentor

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.360
Caption: introducing

00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:57.119
Caption: into this wonderful world that is coding

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.500
Caption: take it away Anton cool

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.180
Caption: so

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.058

Caption: that&#39;s good that they help us to have

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:10.680
Caption: this event for

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:11.938
Caption: pretty great price really

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.239
Caption: so I&#39;m going to be talking about

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.920
Caption: superhero layouts uh

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:20.339
Caption: Comics are said to have passed through

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:23.459
Caption: four ages with each of the ages known to

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:25.019
Caption: have something distinctive about it

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.059
Caption: in the Golden Age we were first

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:30.959
Caption: introduced to the superhero archetype

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:33.298
Caption: this was around about 1938 or so

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:37.199
Caption: this was our introduction to characters

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.119
Caption: like Superman Wonder Woman and Batman

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:41.938
Caption: during the Silver age the world is

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.400
Caption: recovering from a World War and readers

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.680
Caption: had matured during that time so to meet

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.079
Caption: that maturity the stories were focused

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.000
Caption: on horror crime and romance more than

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.279
Caption: what they were before

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.658
Caption: this sort of helped the industry to

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.639
Caption: survive through what was a difficult

00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:58.798
Caption: period

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:00.658
Caption: after the Silver age many of those

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.240
Caption: heroic storylines that the writers could

00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:06.360
Caption: think of were used so they decided

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:08.880
Caption: instead of Bronze Age to tackle the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.399
Caption: social issues of the day this would

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.260
Caption: include bigotry racism and substance

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:15.720
Caption: abuse

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:18.119
Caption: and the modern age is a time of

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.319
Caption: redesigned growth and some disruption by

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:22.319
Caption: the web

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.238
Caption: anyone can publish now bringing more

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.458
Caption: unique stories and making Comics more

00:02:24.238 --> 00:02:28.919
Caption: accessible than to audiences than ever

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:31.080
Caption: thought possible no longer was it about

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:34.559
Caption: a couple of those major players that

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.958
Caption: were creating or publishing comics

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:38.878
Caption: and so what makes Comics an absorbing

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:41.339
Caption: storytelling medium is that along with

00:02:38.878 --> 00:02:43.199
Caption: great characters stories and art styles

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:44.878
Caption: is the impact that the layout can have

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.860
Caption: on that story

00:02:44.878 --> 00:02:50.039
Caption: and we&#39;re going to explore each of the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.440
Caption: ages of comics and how it relates to web

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:55.500
Caption: layout and how CSS grid combined with

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.098
Caption: some other CSS techniques can be used to

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.539
Caption: recreate these layouts and as you&#39;re

00:02:59.098 --> 00:03:03.479
Caption: looking at these they&#39;re obviously very

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:05.159
Caption: comic book Focus but think about how you

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:07.018
Caption: can reimagine the techniques that I&#39;m

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.699
Caption: talking about here for the use in your

00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:09.779
Caption: layouts and projects that you&#39;re working

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.699
Caption: on

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.259
Caption: and I&#39;m not going to dive too much into

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.119
Caption: responsiveness I think there&#39;s a lot of

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:18.119
Caption: great articles that cover that with grid

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:20.518
Caption: already but it is possible to do so and

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:23.639
Caption: there&#39;s a short part here where I will

00:03:20.518 --> 00:03:26.878
Caption: cover it so those comic book ages that I

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:29.639
Caption: went through spanned about 70 years and

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:32.220
Caption: so many years is a fairly long time to

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.919
Caption: be able to evolve a storytelling medium

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.040
Caption: by comparison our industry the web is

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:42.839
Caption: still relatively young HTML is about 29

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:45.018
Caption: years old and CSS is 25 and that makes

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:48.958
Caption: me older than both of them unfortunately

00:03:45.018 --> 00:03:51.598
Caption: not combined but that&#39;s still okay

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:55.018
Caption: so the web is after all young and so if

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:56.878
Caption: anyone else is older than them so are we

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:58.619
Caption: but the point I&#39;m getting at to here is

00:03:56.878 --> 00:04:01.139
Caption: in a relatively short period of time

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:03.539
Caption: layout on the web progress through many

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:07.080
Caption: ages of its own we started off with just

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:08.518
Caption: HTML this was the text links basic

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.279
Caption: elements

00:04:08.518 --> 00:04:12.658
Caption: we sort of co-opted tables to do what

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:15.360
Caption: they weren&#39;t really meant to do and we

00:04:12.658 --> 00:04:18.059
Caption: started using them for layouts the first

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.579
Caption: of our comic book crossovers flash came

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:22.859
Caption: along gave us very Dynamic layouts but

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.020
Caption: it had its own problems and we&#39;ve been

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:27.418
Caption: going through absolute float responsive

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:29.579
Caption: and I think we&#39;re kind of heading into

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.919
Caption: the intrinsic era which is a term that

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:33.599
Caption: I&#39;ve seen Jen Simmons coin that&#39;s

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.000
Caption: talking more about letting the devices

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.880
Caption: Define the layout a bit more we have

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.619
Caption: foldable phones we have fridges

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.860
Caption: all sorts of things

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:46.440
Caption: so all that in 29 short years less than

00:04:43.859 --> 00:04:48.359
Caption: half of that of our friends in the comic

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.519
Caption: industry so it can be really tempting at

00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:53.399
Caption: times to give layout on the web a hard

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:55.619
Caption: time but given the relatively young age

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:58.380
Caption: that our industry is I think it&#39;s

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:59.820
Caption: amazing how far we&#39;ve progressed and we

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.679
Caption: can certainly appreciate what we have

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.300
Caption: now when you consider where it is that

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:06.179
Caption: we&#39;ve come from

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:08.039
Caption: so is the current age of the web going

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:10.500
Caption: to be considered the web&#39;s Modern Age

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.660
Caption: and with CSS grid I think that might

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.479
Caption: just be the case

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.839
Caption: so before I jump too much into code this

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.419
Caption: is me Anton ball uh I&#39;m local here to

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.799
Caption: Perth and I&#39;ve always kind of brought my

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.360
Caption: daughter along to these events so you

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:25.859
Caption: might see me rocking around with her a

00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:28.019
Caption: little bit more later

00:05:25.859 --> 00:05:31.500
Caption: and as you know I&#39;m older than HTML and

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:34.138
Caption: CSS I&#39;m a full stack team lead at doist

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.959
Caption: we make todoist and twist applications

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.720
Caption: you can find me on Twitter at Anton JB

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:41.279
Caption: if you want to and perhaps this is extra

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.679
Caption: information at this point but I quite

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:46.320
Caption: enjoy comics

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:48.419
Caption: so undoubtedly one of the most important

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.820
Caption: comics in history is Action Comics

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.820
Caption: number one this was as I said released

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.320
Caption: around 1938 and what makes it an

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.600
Caption: important comic in the history of all

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.880
Caption: Comics is it&#39;s the introduction of

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.880
Caption: Superman and just so we&#39;re all clear

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.559
Caption: that&#39;s him holding the car up there now

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.520
Caption: Superman has changed a lot through the

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:10.380
Caption: years but this is where they started

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:12.539
Caption: the layout throughout the comics and

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.119
Caption: others even in the golden and silver age

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:17.519
Caption: consisted primarily of rows of squares

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:19.500
Caption: and rectangles if we look at a few of

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:21.239
Caption: the pages from the comic we can see that

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.179
Caption: pattern in use we&#39;ll have a couple of

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:27.059
Caption: squares a long larger rectangle with the

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:28.500
Caption: uh in it but what we are focused on is

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:32.160
Caption: layout so I&#39;m going to strip out the

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:35.339
Caption: imagery and see what we are left with

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.979
Caption: the pattern was one to three panels per

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:40.440
Caption: row staggered throughout the page with a

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:43.139
Caption: somewhat consistent Gap it was printed

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.119
Caption: so you know somewhat consistent in terms

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:48.479
Caption: of CSS Grid it&#39;s a nice starting off

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:51.299
Caption: point we might think that we can do grid

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.639
Caption: template rows and sort of repeat three

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:55.619
Caption: times over one fraction but

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.360
Caption: we need to go a little bit further if we

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:59.699
Caption: want to achieve the Staggering that we

00:06:57.359 --> 00:07:01.559
Caption: can hopefully see here can you actually

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.380
Caption: see the Staggering

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:06.919
Caption: it&#39;s can you see the gray squares I

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.919
Caption: suspect not

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.940
Caption: um oh all right

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.860
Caption: so the way I calculated the columns is

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.839
Caption: to measure the smallest panel on the

00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:18.119
Caption: layout and divide that by the width of

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:21.839
Caption: the comic so the smallest panel would be

00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:24.000
Caption: between two gaps there that you can see

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:26.039
Caption: we aren&#39;t using that size but it gives

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.779
Caption: us the basis with which to work from so

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:29.880
Caption: between two panels is there don&#39;t worry

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:31.919
Caption: more color comes in later

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.580
Caption: so when we divide the page width which

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:37.800
Caption: is 576 by the 36 which is the smallest

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:39.539
Caption: panel we could possibly do that gives us

00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:42.418
Caption: a total number of columns we would want

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:44.519
Caption: to recreate this layout importantly it&#39;s

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:45.419
Caption: the same aspect ratio as the printed

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:47.220
Caption: version

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:49.559
Caption: so turning that into grid we have

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:53.419
Caption: display grid grid template columns

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:55.559
Caption: repeat 16 times over one fraction

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:57.240
Caption: and the grid Gap we can be super

00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:59.279
Caption: consistent now because we&#39;re in the web

00:07:57.239 --> 00:08:01.679
Caption: so

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:03.239
Caption: we don&#39;t need grid template rows in this

00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:06.000
Caption: example because we can rely on the

00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:08.339
Caption: implicit grid to handle that for us

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.339
Caption: and so what do I mean by the implicit

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:14.220
Caption: grid if we were to fill up all of the

00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:16.380
Caption: contents along that first defined grid

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.959
Caption: grid will automatically add a new track

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:21.779
Caption: to the row underneath which will fill up

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:24.119
Caption: with those columns as well and by

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:25.919
Caption: default the implicit grid tracks are

00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:28.440
Caption: automatically sized

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:30.539
Caption: we can start controlling that if we want

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.359
Caption: to with grid Auto rows or grid Auto

00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:34.799
Caption: columns but for the purposes of our demo

00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:38.458
Caption: we&#39;re happy for the grid to just keep

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:40.500
Caption: repeating over as we use it

00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:42.658
Caption: and each panel can then span the number

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.838
Caption: of columns required there so panel one

00:08:42.658 --> 00:08:48.778
Caption: spans across six panel two spans across

00:08:45.838 --> 00:08:52.440
Caption: five and we start to get the layout of

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:54.239
Caption: our grid with the Staggering so there we

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.059
Caption: go we&#39;ve created a comic layout with

00:08:54.239 --> 00:08:58.619
Caption: only a few lines of CSS and the

00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:01.559
Caption: Staggering is a nice touch to avoid

00:08:58.619 --> 00:09:04.018
Caption: being too symmetrical in layout we never

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:06.599
Caption: want it being all the same

00:09:04.018 --> 00:09:08.099
Caption: but it&#39;s while it&#39;s not much code for a

00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:10.859
Caption: lot of possibilities we aren&#39;t really

00:09:08.099 --> 00:09:12.479
Caption: feeling like superheroes just yet

00:09:10.859 --> 00:09:14.579
Caption: so the layout and action comic one

00:09:12.479 --> 00:09:17.338
Caption: didn&#39;t play a huge role in the story

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.799
Caption: itself so it&#39;s it&#39;s more used as a

00:09:17.338 --> 00:09:23.338
Caption: container and that was about it

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:26.099
Caption: so let&#39;s instead jump forward to the

00:09:23.338 --> 00:09:28.559
Caption: Bronze Age which brings it with a change

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:29.518
Caption: in how layout did become a part of the

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:33.179
Caption: story

00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:35.518
Caption: Spider-Man 121 was released around 1973

00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:38.700
Caption: and considered a pivotal point in this

00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:39.479
Caption: character&#39;s sort of story arc and their

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.100
Caption: history

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:43.979
Caption: now I hope it&#39;s not a spoiler for

00:09:41.099 --> 00:09:45.958
Caption: something from 1973 but this is the

00:09:43.979 --> 00:09:47.338
Caption: death of Gwen Stacy which if you&#39;ve seen

00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.719
Caption: any of the movies lately you&#39;re probably

00:09:47.338 --> 00:09:49.799
Caption: familiar with it we can talk about it

00:09:48.719 --> 00:09:52.018
Caption: later

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:54.239
Caption: so what&#39;s great about this story along

00:09:52.018 --> 00:09:56.159
Caption: with the moment artwork and everything

00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:59.640
Caption: involved is the way that the layout

00:09:56.159 --> 00:10:01.559
Caption: became an integral part of its telling

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.958
Caption: the height of the bridge in the fall is

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:05.219
Caption: shown beautifully through those spanning

00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:08.398
Caption: panels

00:10:05.219 --> 00:10:10.199
Caption: you wouldn&#39;t get that sense of height or

00:10:08.398 --> 00:10:11.820
Caption: danger from the grid if it was like the

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.799
Caption: previous example all running along

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.778
Caption: several rows

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:17.820
Caption: so even though it&#39;s a great moment in

00:10:15.778 --> 00:10:20.880
Caption: there let&#39;s again strip out the artwork

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.859
Caption: and see the layout in use

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.320
Caption: so the big difference is the panel

00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:26.700
Caption: spanning multiple rows this is one of

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.440
Caption: the areas where grid has given us a

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.320
Caption: sense of a modern layout we no longer

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.059
Caption: are we constrained to a single axis and

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.580
Caption: the way that I determine the panels was

00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:39.419
Caption: done as the same in the previous one

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:41.459
Caption: this time though we have 23.

00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:43.500
Caption: so we&#39;re still able to rely on implicit

00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:44.940
Caption: grid even though we&#39;re spanning multiple

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:48.898
Caption: rows now

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:52.260
Caption: uh because grid will allow us to do that

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:54.479
Caption: so we add in panel one we span across

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.000
Caption: nine like we did before but now we can

00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:58.979
Caption: span down three rows and grid will

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.278
Caption: handle that panel two will span across

00:10:58.979 --> 00:11:05.699
Caption: seven panel three uh will be whatever

00:11:02.278 --> 00:11:07.979
Caption: the rest of 23 minus nine and seven is

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.260
Caption: and then panel four will just slide into

00:11:07.979 --> 00:11:12.599
Caption: place there grid gives us a lot of

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.160
Caption: things for free which is nice and we

00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:16.139
Caption: were able to Now cover a great many of

00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:18.239
Caption: the layouts during and up to the Bronze

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.040
Caption: Age

00:11:18.239 --> 00:11:22.380
Caption: so next up in the Journey Through the

00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:25.078
Caption: Ages is Watchmen which famous for many

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:27.720
Caption: reasons like the movie but it kicked off

00:11:25.078 --> 00:11:29.820
Caption: The Modern Age of comics now Watchmen

00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:31.500
Caption: adhered to a strict nine panel grid

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.479
Caption: throughout its run which means what

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.760
Caption: we&#39;ve created so far would essentially

00:11:33.479 --> 00:11:36.958
Caption: cover this whole comic book or this

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.398
Caption: series

00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.739
Caption: so there&#39;s hundreds of possibilities

00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:42.419
Caption: with a nine panel grid which is not me

00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:45.000
Caption: recommending everyone go out and do that

00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:46.739
Caption: it just means that it&#39;s very powerful

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.838
Caption: but there was a panel from Watchmen that

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:51.359
Caption: I wanted to recreate it did something

00:11:48.838 --> 00:11:53.039
Caption: just a little bit outside the box with

00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:55.679
Caption: grid

00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:57.179
Caption: now the panel in the middle there it&#39;s

00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:59.458
Caption: there&#39;s a lot going on with the speech

00:11:57.179 --> 00:12:01.799
Caption: bubbles but the artwork you can see is

00:11:59.458 --> 00:12:03.898
Caption: the same image running across the three

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:05.518
Caption: panels it&#39;s not just constrained into

00:12:03.898 --> 00:12:09.000
Caption: one anymore

00:12:05.518 --> 00:12:11.639
Caption: now we could split the image into three

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.398
Caption: if we wanted to it would make it quite

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.799
Caption: easy but I think it&#39;s better if we can

00:12:14.398 --> 00:12:18.000
Caption: recreate the effect while we maintain

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:20.219
Caption: the image

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.778
Caption: it&#39;ll give us some flexibility so if we

00:12:20.219 --> 00:12:23.099
Caption: want to swap the image out later we&#39;re

00:12:21.778 --> 00:12:24.599
Caption: only going to have to do the one and not

00:12:23.099 --> 00:12:26.458
Caption: remember all the various steps and

00:12:24.599 --> 00:12:28.739
Caption: cutting them up into three

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:30.299
Caption: or if we want to work with some

00:12:28.739 --> 00:12:31.679
Caption: responsiveness which we&#39;ll see in this

00:12:30.299 --> 00:12:33.719
Caption: one

00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:36.119
Caption: so the setup here is similar to what we

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:38.578
Caption: had before where I&#39;m aiming to have the

00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:39.958
Caption: image remain intact while we add the Gap

00:12:38.578 --> 00:12:42.419
Caption: in there

00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:44.578
Caption: so panel three which is in the middle we

00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:46.320
Caption: are going to wrap that in another grid

00:12:44.578 --> 00:12:48.599
Caption: so we have our main grid laid out like

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.940
Caption: we have before and panel three has a

00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:53.278
Caption: grid in there as well and it&#39;s spanning

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:56.039
Caption: multiple columns so we have room enough

00:12:53.278 --> 00:12:58.138
Caption: to place the gap

00:12:56.039 --> 00:13:00.898
Caption: now only the direct children of a

00:12:58.138 --> 00:13:03.119
Caption: container can become grid items but with

00:13:00.898 --> 00:13:05.638
Caption: subgrid we&#39;re able to inherit the rows

00:13:03.119 --> 00:13:08.039
Caption: or columns from the parent element

00:13:05.638 --> 00:13:13.259
Caption: now that&#39;s what happens here when we add

00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:14.940
Caption: subgrid onto the overlap area

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.919
Caption: so we&#39;ll look at it without the image to

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.979
Caption: try and better understand what&#39;s

00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:24.179
Caption: happening overlap is pulling in the rows

00:13:19.979 --> 00:13:25.559
Caption: from the main comic itself with that

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:28.260
Caption: subgrid

00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:30.239
Caption: but we don&#39;t if the comics sorry if the

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.220
Caption: columns in the main comic one were to

00:13:30.239 --> 00:13:34.679
Caption: change if we were to add more or change

00:13:32.219 --> 00:13:37.259
Caption: it to be a different ratio then the sub

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:39.719
Caption: panel or overlaps or I would inherit

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:42.059
Caption: that so we&#39;re getting that just for free

00:13:39.719 --> 00:13:44.159
Caption: but we don&#39;t have to inherit the whole

00:13:42.059 --> 00:13:46.440
Caption: Grid in this case we can set our own

00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:48.359
Caption: rows in there as well so we can only

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.119
Caption: inherit what we want and leave the rest

00:13:48.359 --> 00:13:52.859
Caption: out now why that might be useful is if

00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:54.119
Caption: we were to say add the speech bubbles in

00:13:52.859 --> 00:13:57.599
Caption: we&#39;re going to have a better chance of

00:13:54.119 --> 00:13:59.880
Caption: positioning them on the page

00:13:57.599 --> 00:14:03.000
Caption: so putting the graphics back it&#39;s time

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:05.820
Caption: to achieve the Gap in there

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.059
Caption: we do this with a pseudo element we add

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:12.200
Caption: that to the overlap container in there

00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:12.200
Caption: we give it the same

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.919
Caption: graphic visuals as the outline so we

00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:18.539
Caption: give it the same grid Gap and the same

00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:20.700
Caption: coloring I&#39;ve just used a custom

00:14:18.539 --> 00:14:23.159
Caption: property there just to kind of give an

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:26.040
Caption: example of how that could be easier

00:14:23.159 --> 00:14:28.619
Caption: and put it into place

00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:30.419
Caption: and so there we go that&#39;s ticked off our

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:33.119
Caption: goal of maintaining the image while

00:14:30.419 --> 00:14:35.398
Caption: simulating a grid Gap now if we wanted

00:14:33.119 --> 00:14:37.679
Caption: save for mobile for a little bit of

00:14:35.398 --> 00:14:39.659
Caption: responsiveness we could drop that Gap

00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:41.578
Caption: off and just have the whole image there

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:43.799
Caption: if we were thinking outside of just

00:14:41.578 --> 00:14:46.518
Caption: Comics here

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:49.018
Caption: so subgrid is a great next step for grid

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:50.458
Caption: anytime you&#39;ve struggled to align items

00:14:49.018 --> 00:14:53.159
Caption: without setting the height across

00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:54.419
Caption: multiple panels and I&#39;m sure if you&#39;ve

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:56.159
Caption: ever done front end you&#39;ve probably had

00:14:54.419 --> 00:14:58.500
Caption: those three panels and there&#39;ll be some

00:14:56.159 --> 00:14:59.940
Caption: headings on the top and some content in

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.739
Caption: the middle and some of them will have

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.720
Caption: like only a tiny bit of text and then

00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:06.000
Caption: the other one&#39;s like a short novel and

00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:07.379
Caption: they all get stretched out so with

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.898
Caption: subgrid we&#39;ll start to be able to

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.539
Caption: inherit across rows or across columns

00:15:09.898 --> 00:15:14.638
Caption: and keep them consistent

00:15:12.539 --> 00:15:17.159
Caption: this is an example from the todoist

00:15:14.638 --> 00:15:18.599
Caption: website where we run into this so I&#39;ve

00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:20.940
Caption: used the German language here because

00:15:18.599 --> 00:15:24.419
Caption: they&#39;re always good for like long words

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:26.698
Caption: that you can test with these areas so if

00:15:24.419 --> 00:15:29.398
Caption: we set height we run the risk of cutting

00:15:26.698 --> 00:15:31.679
Caption: the text off or having that overlap if

00:15:29.398 --> 00:15:33.539
Caption: we set a minimum height well then we

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:35.398
Caption: have the weird sort of thing where now

00:15:33.539 --> 00:15:37.380
Caption: the buttons aren&#39;t lining up and if you

00:15:35.398 --> 00:15:39.838
Caption: have the designs they typically will

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:42.179
Caption: line up

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:43.799
Caption: so we&#39;re running we have that problem so

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:45.898
Caption: grid and subgrid are going to have us

00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:48.359
Caption: covered if the middle content was to

00:15:45.898 --> 00:15:51.059
Caption: grow the others will grow in all three

00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:52.979
Caption: panels it&#39;ll be very handy and the

00:15:51.059 --> 00:15:54.838
Caption: advantage over the flat grid setup is we

00:15:52.979 --> 00:15:56.760
Caption: get the flexibility of the expanding

00:15:54.838 --> 00:15:58.500
Caption: rows while we get to maintain the

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.299
Caption: semantic relationship of each of the

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.659
Caption: elements each one can be in its own

00:16:00.299 --> 00:16:05.398
Caption: semantic div or whatever it may be and

00:16:03.659 --> 00:16:07.859
Caption: we&#39;re covered

00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:10.219
Caption: but where&#39;s browser support at with some

00:16:07.859 --> 00:16:10.219
Caption: grid

00:16:11.278 --> 00:16:15.659
Caption: not not great

00:16:13.159 --> 00:16:18.359
Caption: we&#39;re still a little bit in experimental

00:16:15.659 --> 00:16:20.398
Caption: territory here and and that&#39;s okay you

00:16:18.359 --> 00:16:22.739
Caption: can still sometimes use it the only

00:16:20.398 --> 00:16:25.440
Caption: browser with subgrid sort of fully

00:16:22.739 --> 00:16:27.359
Caption: implemented is Firefox as in released

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.000
Caption: and they actually did it all the way

00:16:27.359 --> 00:16:32.458
Caption: back in 2019 the day after I gave this

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.039
Caption: talk once they did it

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:36.539
Caption: that&#39;s Safari recently enabled subgrid

00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:38.099
Caption: in the technical preview that&#39;s why I

00:16:36.539 --> 00:16:39.719
Caption: said Firefox is the only one but it&#39;s

00:16:38.099 --> 00:16:41.518
Caption: it&#39;s in there which means by the next

00:16:39.719 --> 00:16:42.958
Caption: versions of safari we&#39;ll start to see

00:16:41.518 --> 00:16:46.440
Caption: subgrid

00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:49.979
Caption: but there is hope in all of this subgrid

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.898
Caption: has been included in interop 2022 which

00:16:49.979 --> 00:16:54.659
Caption: is a combined effort by browser vendors

00:16:51.898 --> 00:16:57.179
Caption: and people that also write code for

00:16:54.659 --> 00:17:02.159
Caption: supporting web standards to close the

00:16:57.179 --> 00:17:04.260
Caption: gap in some of these CSS features uh so

00:17:02.159 --> 00:17:06.298
Caption: they are all going to basically work

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:08.458
Caption: towards having subgrid implemented and

00:17:06.298 --> 00:17:10.859
Caption: passing the same test so that it is

00:17:08.458 --> 00:17:12.479
Caption: displayed correctly across all of the

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:15.418
Caption: browsers

00:17:12.479 --> 00:17:17.880
Caption: before that though and before subgrid is

00:17:15.418 --> 00:17:20.399
Caption: more widely available we can recreate

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.020
Caption: this effect with display content so

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.640
Caption: we&#39;ve added that to overlap and

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:26.578
Caption: essentially what it does

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:29.219
Caption: is get rid of that container in there

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:32.660
Caption: and lifts the items up into the parent

00:17:29.219 --> 00:17:32.659
Caption: grid which is our comic

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:37.079
Caption: we do lose the semantic meaning though

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.059
Caption: which is why I think subgrid is going to

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:41.099
Caption: be a better option for us if we had some

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:43.798
Caption: very specific semantic meaning by adding

00:17:41.099 --> 00:17:46.798
Caption: the display contents it&#39;s gone

00:17:43.798 --> 00:17:48.779
Caption: so that can be a bit of a problem

00:17:46.798 --> 00:17:51.779
Caption: now it&#39;s the next Evolution during the

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:54.239
Caption: Modern Age of comics where layout really

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.219
Caption: gets creative and interesting where

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:57.839
Caption: revisiting the world of Spider-Man here

00:17:56.219 --> 00:18:00.780
Caption: we&#39;ll do that a few times because it&#39;s a

00:17:57.839 --> 00:18:04.260
Caption: bit of a favorite of mine but we started

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:06.479
Caption: to see a new trend in this age of comics

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.520
Caption: This Modern Age brought with layering

00:18:06.479 --> 00:18:10.439
Caption: panels to achieve a flow and depth that

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.000
Caption: we hadn&#39;t previously seen

00:18:10.439 --> 00:18:13.798
Caption: artists were able to focus in and

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.280
Caption: provide little detail elements without

00:18:13.798 --> 00:18:19.380
Caption: taking up all the space that others had

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.320
Caption: now layering&#39;s certainly not new to the

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.900
Caption: web but grid enables us to layer in much

00:18:22.319 --> 00:18:26.579
Caption: easier and predictable ways than with a

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.440
Caption: previous option so let&#39;s take a look at

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:30.659
Caption: some of the code

00:18:28.439 --> 00:18:32.459
Caption: we have display grid we have grid

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.979
Caption: template columns and then we have all

00:18:32.459 --> 00:18:36.599
Caption: these numbers and it&#39;s like wow yeah

00:18:34.979 --> 00:18:38.400
Caption: that&#39;s so much easier than what it was

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:40.739
Caption: before

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.200
Caption: but here&#39;s how I figured it out and if

00:18:40.739 --> 00:18:45.239
Caption: you have the artwork that can be useful

00:18:43.199 --> 00:18:46.500
Caption: which we often do with from the uh the

00:18:45.239 --> 00:18:47.760
Caption: friends in design or if you design

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.678
Caption: yourself

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.900
Caption: and we&#39;ll focus on the rows so there&#39;s

00:18:49.678 --> 00:18:55.199
Caption: the number of rows that we have is nine

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:57.479
Caption: we have nine we have that we want to

00:18:55.199 --> 00:18:59.880
Caption: place out in here now this is starting

00:18:57.479 --> 00:19:01.678
Caption: to look like a similar trend if we

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:05.219
Caption: divide the height by the number of rows

00:19:01.678 --> 00:19:07.260
Caption: we get a base for one fraction unit so

00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:10.260
Caption: we can do this with one of the panels as

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:12.000
Caption: well we can use that as one fraction but

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.440
Caption: this is the way that I kind of went for

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.418
Caption: it

00:19:13.439 --> 00:19:18.599
Caption: so next we divide the height of an

00:19:15.418 --> 00:19:22.199
Caption: individual row by that base fraction

00:19:18.599 --> 00:19:23.819
Caption: so 291 is the row we want 109 is the

00:19:22.199 --> 00:19:27.178
Caption: base unit that we&#39;re using and that

00:19:23.819 --> 00:19:28.918
Caption: gives us 2.6 fraction units

00:19:27.178 --> 00:19:31.260
Caption: so what what are these fraction units

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:34.319
Caption: and why are we do we keep using them in

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.400
Caption: Grid they give us a bit more flexibility

00:19:34.319 --> 00:19:38.279
Caption: when we need to make everything

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:40.140
Caption: responsive and maintain the aspect ratio

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.820
Caption: and also if you can&#39;t really use

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.440
Caption: percentages because we have the Gap

00:19:41.819 --> 00:19:45.298
Caption: value in Grid as well and if you use

00:19:43.439 --> 00:19:48.779
Caption: percentages with gaps things will start

00:19:45.298 --> 00:19:51.058
Caption: to get weird and over overlap but if we

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.160
Caption: use the fractions it&#39;s going to stick

00:19:51.058 --> 00:19:55.199
Caption: within those bounds and the gaps will

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.000
Caption: also help to stick it in there or they

00:19:55.199 --> 00:19:59.519
Caption: will they will work together with gap

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.859
Caption: rather than against it and we repeat

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.419
Caption: that same process to determine the

00:20:01.859 --> 00:20:05.459
Caption: columns

00:20:03.418 --> 00:20:07.500
Caption: so there we go that&#39;s how we got to all

00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:09.298
Caption: those numbers

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.520
Caption: now we can then layer our panels over

00:20:09.298 --> 00:20:13.979
Caption: the top where needed using grid row and

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.500
Caption: grid column values so our panel three

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:20.520
Caption: which has the young lady in it we have

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:24.178
Caption: grid Row 4 to 7 and grid column five

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:27.119
Caption: span one and Z index just to bring it up

00:20:24.178 --> 00:20:29.399
Caption: onto the top now panel four we have grid

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:32.280
Caption: row five through to nine so we&#39;re saying

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:35.880
Caption: from five to nine but interestingly we

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:38.940
Caption: have grid column two to negative two

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:42.178
Caption: so where does this negative 2 come from

00:20:38.939 --> 00:20:44.759
Caption: in here the grid lines each of the lines

00:20:42.178 --> 00:20:47.399
Caption: in a grid are numbered one through to n

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:50.280
Caption: in our case that&#39;s eight the total

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:53.339
Caption: number of lines that we have so the

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:56.099
Caption: starting line for panel four is two we

00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:58.619
Caption: wanted it a little bit in

00:20:56.099 --> 00:21:01.319
Caption: but those lines are also numbered in

00:20:58.619 --> 00:21:05.099
Caption: Reverse so from what would be our

00:21:01.319 --> 00:21:07.678
Caption: typical reading order from the right is

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:08.640
Caption: negative one through to negative n or

00:21:07.678 --> 00:21:11.880
Caption: eight

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:15.000
Caption: so if we want to lay uh finish up two

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:17.400
Caption: lines in we can use negative two the

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.280
Caption: benefit of that is when inevitably our

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.260
Caption: design changes later on if more lines

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.179
Caption: were to be added into the middle we

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.880
Caption: don&#39;t have to update everywhere that we

00:21:24.178 --> 00:21:29.099
Caption: do it if we said span to the distance we

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.839
Caption: want and then we add something new well

00:21:29.099 --> 00:21:32.699
Caption: now we have to go and update everything

00:21:30.839 --> 00:21:35.400
Caption: so as long as we&#39;re not changing that

00:21:32.699 --> 00:21:37.260
Caption: too much it will adjust with the grid it

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.239
Caption: can be pretty handy

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.219
Caption: and most of the browser Dev tools will

00:21:39.239 --> 00:21:43.439
Caption: show you these numbers in this case it&#39;s

00:21:41.219 --> 00:21:45.178
Caption: Firefox but you can inspect the element

00:21:43.439 --> 00:21:48.178
Caption: and typically you can turn on line

00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:50.099
Caption: numbers line names and other properties

00:21:48.178 --> 00:21:53.038
Caption: like that

00:21:50.099 --> 00:21:56.099
Caption: so the Modern Age have made prolific use

00:21:53.038 --> 00:21:58.379
Caption: of this layering this is another example

00:21:56.099 --> 00:22:00.058
Caption: of Hawkeye

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.500
Caption: and it can be a great way to finally

00:22:00.058 --> 00:22:03.418
Caption: break out of the boxes that have

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.939
Caption: contained Us in design and layout for so

00:22:03.418 --> 00:22:08.099
Caption: many years here&#39;s the web Recreation on

00:22:05.939 --> 00:22:09.959
Caption: the other side that I&#39;ve done

00:22:08.099 --> 00:22:11.640
Caption: and we&#39;re not using Gap here we&#39;re just

00:22:09.959 --> 00:22:13.918
Caption: adding some borders so that we can

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.200
Caption: because grid can&#39;t do sort of funky gaps

00:22:13.918 --> 00:22:18.119
Caption: like that but we can overlay each of

00:22:16.199 --> 00:22:19.859
Caption: them on there and then start to add some

00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:24.079
Caption: borders and create some real interesting

00:22:19.859 --> 00:22:24.079
Caption: depth into some of our designs

00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:28.079
Caption: but

00:22:25.798 --> 00:22:30.359
Caption: with great power comes great

00:22:28.079 --> 00:22:33.418
Caption: responsibility

00:22:30.359 --> 00:22:35.640
Caption: to keep with the theme of what I&#39;m doing

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:37.979
Caption: layering is an exciting addition to our

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.659
Caption: layout toolboxes but we do have to

00:22:37.979 --> 00:22:41.579
Caption: consider more than just the layout it

00:22:39.659 --> 00:22:42.900
Caption: opens up to us there&#39;s an inherent

00:22:41.579 --> 00:22:45.538
Caption: danger here when you can just position

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:48.359
Caption: something anywhere on the page

00:22:45.538 --> 00:22:50.339
Caption: if the source order isn&#39;t created in a

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:53.699
Caption: way that makes sense you can negatively

00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:56.038
Caption: impact the accessibility of your project

00:22:53.699 --> 00:22:59.038
Caption: so as an example if we decided that the

00:22:56.038 --> 00:23:01.859
Caption: panel 4 was better up the top we can

00:22:59.038 --> 00:23:04.319
Caption: just do that we can move it with grid

00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:06.298
Caption: but solely changing the visual layout is

00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:09.538
Caption: not going to tell the browser

00:23:06.298 --> 00:23:11.158
Caption: that the source order has changed so a

00:23:09.538 --> 00:23:14.219
Caption: screen reader might come in and start to

00:23:11.159 --> 00:23:16.980
Caption: go through that information by going the

00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:18.418
Caption: first sort of few images to the girl to

00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:20.640
Caption: the field

00:23:18.418 --> 00:23:22.678
Caption: whereas we&#39;ve now changed the visual

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.299
Caption: order to field and then the other things

00:23:22.678 --> 00:23:27.319
Caption: going down so that&#39;s something that we

00:23:24.298 --> 00:23:27.319
Caption: need to be careful of

00:23:27.918 --> 00:23:32.699
Caption: to avoid falling into this trap there&#39;s

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.380
Caption: a few things that we can do we can look

00:23:32.699 --> 00:23:36.000
Caption: at the structure of our document first

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.880
Caption: and make sure that we&#39;re layering it out

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.558
Caption: in HTML order correctly

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.319
Caption: we can then create the grid that

00:23:40.558 --> 00:23:46.079
Caption: supports that and then like any hero be

00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:48.538
Caption: vigilant and maintain that order when

00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:50.099
Caption: you are working on these

00:23:48.538 --> 00:23:53.038
Caption: a really good place to start reading

00:23:50.099 --> 00:23:55.558
Caption: into grid accessibility is mdm&#39;s layout

00:23:53.038 --> 00:23:59.279
Caption: and accessibility uh guide that they

00:23:55.558 --> 00:24:02.158
Caption: have on the article on the website sorry

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:04.020
Caption: so a common criticism of web design and

00:24:02.159 --> 00:24:06.179
Caption: layout is that everything is within a

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:08.219
Caption: box you may have heard it sort of the

00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:10.439
Caption: reference to bootstrap layouts or maybe

00:24:08.219 --> 00:24:13.380
Caption: a little bit of those libraries that

00:24:10.439 --> 00:24:15.178
Caption: have helped us work fast but have

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.239
Caption: reduced some of the creativity that

00:24:15.178 --> 00:24:19.558
Caption: we&#39;re able to get from these Frameworks

00:24:17.239 --> 00:24:21.000
Caption: and so far looking at a lot of these

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:24.058
Caption: Comics we have some layering but

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.400
Caption: everything is still a box

00:24:24.058 --> 00:24:28.199
Caption: now for Comics boxy layout started to

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.080
Caption: change during the Modern Age of comics

00:24:28.199 --> 00:24:33.298
Caption: the characters broke out of their boxes

00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:35.699
Caption: and the storytelling once again evolved

00:24:33.298 --> 00:24:38.058
Caption: with them now this is a nice example

00:24:35.699 --> 00:24:40.439
Caption: from Phoenix and Jean Gray

00:24:38.058 --> 00:24:42.959
Caption: showing how different shapes can enhance

00:24:40.439 --> 00:24:45.298
Caption: the storytelling and our recreated

00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:49.140
Caption: example alongside it so that is running

00:24:45.298 --> 00:24:51.479
Caption: and it is of a valid website

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.700
Caption: so fundamentally everything within a

00:24:51.479 --> 00:24:57.658
Caption: grid is still going to be a box we can&#39;t

00:24:53.699 --> 00:25:00.599
Caption: do random shapes like this

00:24:57.659 --> 00:25:02.220
Caption: but we can combine our boxes with some

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:04.260
Caption: new techniques and get a bit creative

00:25:02.219 --> 00:25:07.020
Caption: and give the illusion of almost any

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.880
Caption: shape that we like

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:11.400
Caption: so there&#39;s a little bit of boilerplate

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.900
Caption: in this we&#39;re setting up our comic to

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.460
Caption: contain everything we&#39;ve got position

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.140
Caption: relative because we&#39;re going to do some

00:25:14.459 --> 00:25:17.579
Caption: absolute positioning and floating and

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.859
Caption: things are going to get weird so we&#39;ve

00:25:17.579 --> 00:25:22.019
Caption: got overflow hidden on there as well to

00:25:19.859 --> 00:25:24.119
Caption: make sure nothing escapes

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.919
Caption: we want it to break out of the box but

00:25:24.119 --> 00:25:26.880
Caption: not too far I&#39;m going to keep it in

00:25:25.918 --> 00:25:29.399
Caption: there

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:32.520
Caption: now the panels grids has a column for

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:35.279
Caption: each of our five panels and they&#39;re just

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.799
Caption: regular panels going along like we&#39;ve

00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:39.480
Caption: seen before but we can only see a few of

00:25:37.798 --> 00:25:41.339
Caption: the images and that&#39;s because we&#39;re

00:25:39.479 --> 00:25:43.020
Caption: needing to overlap everything because

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:44.880
Caption: we&#39;re going to be cutting away some of

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.859
Caption: the image we need the other one sitting

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:49.199
Caption: underneath we can&#39;t have each one in its

00:25:46.859 --> 00:25:51.479
Caption: own cell because if we go away and sort

00:25:49.199 --> 00:25:52.739
Caption: of cut away the image the background is

00:25:51.479 --> 00:25:53.699
Caption: going to show through where we want the

00:25:52.739 --> 00:25:56.219
Caption: image

00:25:53.699 --> 00:25:58.380
Caption: now hopefully to help visualize see this

00:25:56.219 --> 00:26:01.140
Caption: is a layering that we&#39;re working with in

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.599
Caption: our grid in there

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.459
Caption: so our panel container is then rotated

00:26:03.599 --> 00:26:07.619
Caption: and using absolute position so the

00:26:05.459 --> 00:26:09.959
Caption: position along the bottom whereabouts we

00:26:07.619 --> 00:26:11.819
Caption: want it and we&#39;ve rotated it a little

00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:14.520
Caption: bit and just sort of shimming it down

00:26:11.819 --> 00:26:16.139
Caption: about where we want look the details

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.520
Caption: aren&#39;t super important we&#39;ve put it down

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.979
Caption: there

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.459
Caption: so click path is what&#39;s going to enable

00:26:19.979 --> 00:26:25.798
Caption: these shapes that we&#39;ve wanted

00:26:23.459 --> 00:26:28.739
Caption: when you add a clip path rule in this

00:26:25.798 --> 00:26:30.658
Caption: case a polygon we have an X Y value for

00:26:28.739 --> 00:26:33.178
Caption: each of those things and it makes its

00:26:30.659 --> 00:26:34.620
Caption: way around the shape and that gives us

00:26:33.178 --> 00:26:38.099
Caption: the image

00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:40.918
Caption: now we can apply a clip path to each of

00:26:38.099 --> 00:26:44.158
Caption: our images and then we&#39;ve most of the

00:26:40.918 --> 00:26:47.399
Caption: way there with what we were doing

00:26:44.159 --> 00:26:48.900
Caption: now again we&#39;ve got like all these

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.580
Caption: random numbers

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.739
Caption: on there and you&#39;re probably thinking

00:26:50.579 --> 00:26:54.658
Caption: this still doesn&#39;t look easier

00:26:52.739 --> 00:26:56.459
Caption: but Firefox has given us some great

00:26:54.659 --> 00:26:57.960
Caption: tools here the dev tools are really

00:26:56.459 --> 00:27:00.058
Caption: going to come in handy when you start

00:26:57.959 --> 00:27:03.000
Caption: doing some things like this

00:27:00.058 --> 00:27:05.520
Caption: if you select the icon in there

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.719
Caption: you can start to move the nodes around

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.419
Caption: yourself

00:27:06.719 --> 00:27:11.520
Caption: and you can double click to add a new

00:27:09.418 --> 00:27:13.678
Caption: node and start to drag that and you&#39;ll

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.140
Caption: see the values are updating in the dev

00:27:13.678 --> 00:27:18.298
Caption: tools so to create this I was doing that

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:22.558
Caption: in the dev tools and then copying that

00:27:18.298 --> 00:27:25.199
Caption: value across and adjusting as I need it

00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:26.579
Caption: now for the white border we can&#39;t use

00:27:25.199 --> 00:27:29.760
Caption: grid gut because everything&#39;s

00:27:26.579 --> 00:27:31.558
Caption: overlapping so the Box the container has

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.659
Caption: a white background and then the same

00:27:31.558 --> 00:27:35.760
Caption: clip path is added to the image but Jen

00:27:33.659 --> 00:27:37.799
Caption: just shrunk down a little bit

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.839
Caption: and because we&#39;re doing that we need to

00:27:37.798 --> 00:27:40.979
Caption: slightly tweak the transform origin

00:27:39.839 --> 00:27:42.719
Caption: because we&#39;re dealing with some pretty

00:27:40.979 --> 00:27:44.219
Caption: funny shapes here there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot

00:27:42.719 --> 00:27:46.079
Caption: of little adjustments you&#39;ll need to do

00:27:44.219 --> 00:27:47.400
Caption: when you start making shapes like this

00:27:46.079 --> 00:27:49.199
Caption: but

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.820
Caption: that&#39;s one of the downsides of the

00:27:49.199 --> 00:27:55.339
Caption: technique you&#39;re going to have to manage

00:27:50.819 --> 00:27:55.339
Caption: the grid Gap manually yourself

00:27:55.739 --> 00:28:00.000
Caption: but there we go we&#39;ve recreated the

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.260
Caption: shapes from that comic which when you

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.939
Caption: initially look at it you would have

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.279
Caption: thought there&#39;s no way we can do that

00:28:02.939 --> 00:28:07.139
Caption: sort of layer on the web

00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:10.340
Caption: and if you haven&#39;t seen it yet each of

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:12.479
Caption: the links underneath it to the code pen

00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:13.859
Caption: versions of each of these so you can

00:28:12.479 --> 00:28:15.479
Caption: have a look at them and play but I have

00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:18.000
Caption: a another Link at the end which will

00:28:15.479 --> 00:28:21.178
Caption: link to all of them

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.219
Caption: so clip path is no doubt a powerful tool

00:28:21.178 --> 00:28:25.380
Caption: when combined with grid so we&#39;re going

00:28:23.219 --> 00:28:29.219
Caption: to have another example here which is

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:31.558
Caption: Detective Comics number 876

00:28:29.219 --> 00:28:33.719
Caption: taking the grid layering and from our

00:28:31.558 --> 00:28:35.819
Caption: earlier examples we can recreate this

00:28:33.719 --> 00:28:38.520
Caption: same layout the drawing is a little more

00:28:35.819 --> 00:28:39.719
Caption: intense but it&#39;s the layout in the

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.058
Caption: background we&#39;re going to focus on

00:28:39.719 --> 00:28:45.298
Caption: Batman could be done by just the

00:28:42.058 --> 00:28:47.158
Caption: layering that we looked at before

00:28:45.298 --> 00:28:49.199
Caption: the shapes can be recreated by adding

00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:51.179
Caption: perspective and rotating the panel so

00:28:49.199 --> 00:28:53.278
Caption: we&#39;ve added our grid we&#39;re adding a

00:28:51.178 --> 00:28:56.038
Caption: panel to the Grid in similar ways that

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:58.020
Caption: we have before and then we transform we

00:28:56.038 --> 00:29:00.298
Caption: use some perspective that gives us that

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.919
Caption: nice little angle and rotate it into

00:29:00.298 --> 00:29:03.538
Caption: that and then the same with panel two

00:29:01.918 --> 00:29:05.759
Caption: all the way down but you can see there&#39;s

00:29:03.538 --> 00:29:07.979
Caption: a problem here in that the blue

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.359
Caption: background of each of them is coming

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:12.298
Caption: through we didn&#39;t want that we wanted

00:29:09.359 --> 00:29:15.359
Caption: just the squares going down the page and

00:29:12.298 --> 00:29:17.880
Caption: sort of forming one shape

00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:20.099
Caption: again we can use clip path here to cut

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.899
Caption: out the part clip path is sort of

00:29:20.099 --> 00:29:23.099
Caption: showing the part that we do want visible

00:29:21.899 --> 00:29:24.659
Caption: so you&#39;re kind of doing you&#39;re not

00:29:23.099 --> 00:29:26.219
Caption: cutting out the styles that you don&#39;t

00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:28.980
Caption: you&#39;re making the part that you do want

00:29:26.219 --> 00:29:31.739
Caption: visible but with each panel having a

00:29:28.979 --> 00:29:34.439
Caption: clip path on it it gives the impression

00:29:31.739 --> 00:29:36.359
Caption: of a border going all the way down while

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:38.038
Caption: giving us that shape so it&#39;s again

00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:40.678
Caption: something quite interesting and

00:29:38.038 --> 00:29:44.759
Caption: different for the web

00:29:40.678 --> 00:29:46.918
Caption: so there it is next to Mr Batman

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:49.020
Caption: that clip path isn&#39;t limited to just

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:51.778
Caption: polygons there is a lot going on in

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.179
Caption: these images but we have flash on the

00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:55.679
Caption: side and I particularly enjoy the cats

00:29:54.178 --> 00:29:58.199
Caption: up the top here

00:29:55.678 --> 00:29:59.939
Caption: looks like Too Faced to keep with our

00:29:58.199 --> 00:30:02.219
Caption: comic book thing so we&#39;ve got our

00:29:59.939 --> 00:30:03.719
Caption: polygons that we&#39;ve seen

00:30:02.219 --> 00:30:05.939
Caption: but

00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:08.158
Caption: there are some other options ellipse

00:30:05.939 --> 00:30:10.678
Caption: allows for oval shape again the first

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:12.480
Caption: two values are our radius and then the X

00:30:10.678 --> 00:30:13.798
Caption: and Y allows us to offset it a little

00:30:12.479 --> 00:30:16.500
Caption: bit

00:30:13.798 --> 00:30:19.380
Caption: and circle for a more uniform shape

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:21.839
Caption: similar to ellipse the first value is a

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:24.298
Caption: radius followed by the position and we

00:30:21.839 --> 00:30:26.579
Caption: can have something else

00:30:24.298 --> 00:30:28.798
Caption: so clip path affected the shape of the

00:30:26.579 --> 00:30:31.918
Caption: container but we can also have the text

00:30:28.798 --> 00:30:34.500
Caption: react to the shape of the container as

00:30:31.918 --> 00:30:37.079
Caption: well using CSS shapes

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:39.899
Caption: this is a panel from Saga and the part

00:30:37.079 --> 00:30:42.599
Caption: that&#39;s important here is how the moon

00:30:39.899 --> 00:30:45.239
Caption: has its curve or the planet and then the

00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:47.538
Caption: text is also curving along that now this

00:30:45.239 --> 00:30:51.599
Caption: has existed in magazines for a long time

00:30:47.538 --> 00:30:53.519
Caption: but it&#39;s been absent for from the web

00:30:51.599 --> 00:30:56.278
Caption: but again we&#39;ll do a little bit of setup

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.140
Caption: here we have our panel position relative

00:30:56.279 --> 00:31:01.679
Caption: because we&#39;re moving things about again

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:03.239
Caption: our paragraph We shift it into place and

00:31:01.678 --> 00:31:04.918
Caption: the important part here is our image

00:31:03.239 --> 00:31:07.260
Caption: which we&#39;ve moved to the side we could

00:31:04.918 --> 00:31:08.819
Caption: have done this with grid as well the

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.919
Caption: width and the height but the shape

00:31:08.819 --> 00:31:12.898
Caption: outside is what we&#39;re interested in the

00:31:10.918 --> 00:31:15.359
Caption: circle

00:31:12.899 --> 00:31:18.059
Caption: so Firefox again has been helping us

00:31:15.359 --> 00:31:20.278
Caption: developers out with the dev tools we can

00:31:18.058 --> 00:31:21.298
Caption: apply a shape outside and just use some

00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:24.059
Caption: values

00:31:21.298 --> 00:31:27.479
Caption: but then we can select that icon and

00:31:24.058 --> 00:31:29.520
Caption: start resizing in real time and I&#39;ve I&#39;m

00:31:27.479 --> 00:31:31.678
Caption: certainly a visual kind of a learner and

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.599
Caption: I like to see things happening with code

00:31:31.678 --> 00:31:35.278
Caption: maybe that&#39;s why I prefer the front end

00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:37.199
Caption: but

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:39.000
Caption: we can see that and we can take those

00:31:37.199 --> 00:31:40.739
Caption: values and we can move it back to our

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.959
Caption: CSS so it&#39;s really nice that the tools

00:31:40.739 --> 00:31:45.418
Caption: are helping us with this creative coding

00:31:42.959 --> 00:31:46.558
Caption: side of things I didn&#39;t mean to skip but

00:31:45.418 --> 00:31:49.199
Caption: we&#39;ll move on

00:31:46.558 --> 00:31:51.359
Caption: the shapes can also be more complex than

00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:52.979
Caption: just circles so

00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:55.079
Caption: there is definitely going to be a moment

00:31:52.979 --> 00:31:57.239
Caption: in your career where a designer comes to

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:59.640
Caption: you and says we&#39;ve got a cat

00:31:57.239 --> 00:32:01.798
Caption: and we need the text to wrap around it

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:04.020
Caption: and you go I saw these ones

00:32:01.798 --> 00:32:05.760
Caption: and so we can use the polygon shape that

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:08.339
Caption: we&#39;ve had before and we can draw around

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:12.058
Caption: our cat and we can do that

00:32:08.339 --> 00:32:13.918
Caption: now we can also with something that clip

00:32:12.058 --> 00:32:16.260
Caption: path didn&#39;t allow us but shape outside

00:32:13.918 --> 00:32:18.778
Caption: does is use an alpha mark So if we have

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:20.579
Caption: our cat and then we have an alpha mass

00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:22.740
Caption: that represents the shape of our cat

00:32:20.579 --> 00:32:25.979
Caption: very similar to a background image we

00:32:22.739 --> 00:32:28.859
Caption: can say shape outside URL cat mask

00:32:25.979 --> 00:32:31.380
Caption: there&#39;s some cause funniness in here but

00:32:28.859 --> 00:32:32.699
Caption: that&#39;s boring this is kind of what we&#39;re

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.440
Caption: going to look at here and you can look

00:32:32.699 --> 00:32:37.500
Caption: at the cause problems later it needs to

00:32:34.439 --> 00:32:39.778
Caption: be on the same domain essentially

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:43.020
Caption: so what we&#39;ve created is a great example

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:46.080
Caption: of the modern web but it is based on a

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:48.359
Caption: western modern web it&#39;s Western Comics

00:32:46.079 --> 00:32:50.519
Caption: Styles and structures

00:32:48.359 --> 00:32:51.778
Caption: that&#39;s reading left to right top to

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.640
Caption: bottom

00:32:51.779 --> 00:32:56.100
Caption: the structure and reading style isn&#39;t

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.260
Caption: the only comic structure that exists

00:32:56.099 --> 00:33:01.439
Caption: though for instance Japan has a very

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:03.479
Caption: healthy industry with its manga

00:33:01.439 --> 00:33:05.219
Caption: now I&#39;ve been a particular fan of Naruto

00:33:03.479 --> 00:33:08.520
Caption: for a while so it&#39;s fun again that I get

00:33:05.219 --> 00:33:09.959
Caption: to just keep putting all of my hobbies

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:12.119
Caption: into this talk

00:33:09.959 --> 00:33:15.298
Caption: but this is the same page from the manga

00:33:12.119 --> 00:33:16.798
Caption: in Japanese and in English now even with

00:33:15.298 --> 00:33:19.619
Caption: the English one we can see that the

00:33:16.798 --> 00:33:21.538
Caption: start is on the other side to what we&#39;re

00:33:19.619 --> 00:33:23.640
Caption: used to and it finishes on the other

00:33:21.538 --> 00:33:25.379
Caption: side of there but the English version

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:28.260
Caption: even though it&#39;s translated they kept

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:30.539
Caption: the layout the same uh

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.760
Caption: we could position the cells in our grid

00:33:30.538 --> 00:33:35.038
Caption: in this way quite

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.419
Caption: straightforward but we&#39;ll remember from

00:33:35.038 --> 00:33:39.000
Caption: before

00:33:36.418 --> 00:33:41.219
Caption: The Source order matters so if we were

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.260
Caption: to have alt text and everything on here

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:45.119
Caption: if we were to put it in that order then

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:47.940
Caption: the screen reader is going to read it

00:33:45.119 --> 00:33:51.418
Caption: somewhat backwards more from the top

00:33:47.939 --> 00:33:54.058
Caption: down to the other side oops

00:33:51.418 --> 00:33:56.579
Caption: so when placed into the grid with a left

00:33:54.058 --> 00:33:58.558
Caption: to right direction we can do it like so

00:33:56.579 --> 00:34:01.260
Caption: we&#39;ll have our first panel second third

00:33:58.558 --> 00:34:03.778
Caption: through to the sixth so similar to at

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:06.558
Caption: least in my experience a reading style

00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:06.559
Caption: that I&#39;m used to

00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:11.398
Caption: grid has us really well covered for

00:34:09.599 --> 00:34:14.339
Caption: internationalization when direction

00:34:11.398 --> 00:34:15.959
Caption: right to left is applied this can be in

00:34:14.339 --> 00:34:18.119
Caption: multiple places in the page but I&#39;ve

00:34:15.959 --> 00:34:21.898
Caption: done it directly here on the main

00:34:18.118 --> 00:34:24.358
Caption: grid just flips it to what right to left

00:34:21.898 --> 00:34:27.059
Caption: is so panel one is now over to the side

00:34:24.358 --> 00:34:28.618
Caption: two three four five so we&#39;ve covered the

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.359
Caption: accessibility by putting it in the

00:34:28.618 --> 00:34:33.959
Caption: correct order we&#39;ve added our grid but

00:34:30.358 --> 00:34:36.178
Caption: then we&#39;ve enabled other styles with a

00:34:33.959 --> 00:34:38.459
Caption: simple property

00:34:36.178 --> 00:34:41.098
Caption: so of interest in this comic you&#39;ll

00:34:38.459 --> 00:34:43.378
Caption: notice the difference in Grid gaps

00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:46.320
Caption: in the example you can do that as well

00:34:43.378 --> 00:34:48.479
Caption: with a grid Gap it doesn&#39;t always have

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:51.659
Caption: to be consistent in here we&#39;re affecting

00:34:48.479 --> 00:34:54.719
Caption: the horizontal and the vertical Gap

00:34:51.658 --> 00:34:57.000
Caption: what&#39;s also worth noting in the manga is

00:34:54.719 --> 00:35:00.959
Caption: that the text runs vertically but in

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.399
Caption: English it&#39;s left to right

00:35:00.959 --> 00:35:05.399
Caption: now I didn&#39;t want to attempt to write

00:35:02.399 --> 00:35:06.959
Caption: Japanese so I did it with English and

00:35:05.399 --> 00:35:08.939
Caption: you do get a bit of a weird thing where

00:35:06.959 --> 00:35:12.118
Caption: the text runs that way but with writing

00:35:08.939 --> 00:35:14.280
Caption: mode vertical right to left it will go

00:35:12.118 --> 00:35:16.439
Caption: in the direction that someone like that

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:19.380
Caption: would be expecting

00:35:16.439 --> 00:35:22.319
Caption: with the logographic typeset such as

00:35:19.379 --> 00:35:24.539
Caption: what Japanese has that will work out uh

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:26.339
Caption: correctly

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:28.320
Caption: not actually sure why it does that with

00:35:26.339 --> 00:35:30.420
Caption: English but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a really

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.400
Caption: valid explanation

00:35:30.419 --> 00:35:34.139
Caption: so that brings us to the end of our

00:35:32.399 --> 00:35:36.959
Caption: journey through the ages of comic and

00:35:34.139 --> 00:35:38.519
Caption: how they can be brought to the web

00:35:36.959 --> 00:35:40.320
Caption: I mentioned at the start that although

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.119
Caption: the examples are for Comics to think

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.800
Caption: about how you can apply these to the

00:35:42.118 --> 00:35:45.000
Caption: projects that you&#39;re working on and I

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.099
Caption: hope the various effects that I&#39;ve

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.839
Caption: demonstrated have sort of sparked some

00:35:47.099 --> 00:35:50.940
Caption: ideas of something different that you

00:35:48.839 --> 00:35:53.520
Caption: can do with layout

00:35:50.939 --> 00:35:55.139
Caption: and taking it to the everyday products

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.780
Caption: of the web

00:35:55.139 --> 00:35:59.819
Caption: we&#39;ve been in these layout boxes for

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:02.400
Caption: quite some time so imagine when you

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:04.140
Caption: apply these layouts to your projects

00:36:02.399 --> 00:36:05.219
Caption: sort of great things will start to

00:36:04.139 --> 00:36:06.719
Caption: happen

00:36:05.219 --> 00:36:10.260
Caption: and that&#39;s why I believe we&#39;re now in

00:36:06.719 --> 00:36:12.780
Caption: the Modern Age of the layout on the web

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:15.118
Caption: CSS grid gives us great new powers and

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:17.099
Caption: flexibility with our layout we saw how

00:36:15.118 --> 00:36:19.618
Caption: we could stagger content layer our

00:36:17.099 --> 00:36:22.740
Caption: panels to create depth and interest the

00:36:19.618 --> 00:36:24.719
Caption: coming CSS grid level 2 spec will give

00:36:22.739 --> 00:36:27.239
Caption: us the ability with subgrid to align

00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:29.040
Caption: better across multiple panels

00:36:27.239 --> 00:36:31.679
Caption: and getting a little more creative and

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.380
Caption: breaking out of the layout box the CSS

00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:36.719
Caption: shapes clip path and shape outside

00:36:34.379 --> 00:36:39.239
Caption: making our projects as accessible to as

00:36:36.719 --> 00:36:42.419
Caption: wide an audience as possible with Grid&#39;s

00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:44.520
Caption: great support for internationalization

00:36:42.419 --> 00:36:48.000
Caption: I mentioned earlier that the code pens

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:49.919
Caption: were all available this is the URL where

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.199
Caption: you can find them and I also have it

00:36:49.919 --> 00:36:54.838
Caption: linked on my Twitter if you want to have

00:36:52.199 --> 00:36:57.540
Caption: a play around with those

00:36:54.839 --> 00:37:00.180
Caption: in a torque setting it can be hard to

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.780
Caption: get through everything did you get the

00:37:00.179 --> 00:37:04.858
Caption: photo do you want me to go back

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:07.260
Caption: uh it can be hard to get through

00:37:04.858 --> 00:37:10.019
Caption: everything in a torque setting so I&#39;ve

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:12.359
Caption: written blog posts that go through each

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:14.459
Caption: one of those areas and it goes into a

00:37:12.358 --> 00:37:16.679
Caption: lot more detail than what is possible in

00:37:14.459 --> 00:37:18.919
Caption: a talk so that can be useful for you as

00:37:16.679 --> 00:37:18.919
Caption: well

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.520
Caption: so Stan Lee had a famous catchphrase he

00:37:21.719 --> 00:37:25.560
Caption: used to sign off letters and

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.020
Caption: correspondence that he had with fans

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.820
Caption: which was Excelsior and as a little bit

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:33.179
Caption: of a hat tip I thought it would be nice

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:35.940
Caption: to include that in my talk as a closing

00:37:33.179 --> 00:37:37.800
Caption: he&#39;s had a great effect on many comic uh

00:37:35.939 --> 00:37:40.679
Caption: sorry in many creative Industries and

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.000
Caption: but after looking up at meaning I sort

00:37:40.679 --> 00:37:43.319
Caption: of thought it was a really fantastic way

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.780
Caption: to finish a talk

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.400
Caption: Excelsior stands for ever upwards so I

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.320
Caption: think take what you learn from this talk

00:37:47.399 --> 00:37:51.419
Caption: and all the other great talks today and

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.280
Caption: see how you can apply that to what

00:37:51.419 --> 00:37:54.839
Caption: you&#39;re working with

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:58.218
Caption: thanks very much

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.218
Caption: [Applause]

00:37:59.459 --> 00:38:04.560
Caption: thank you so much for that amazing talk

00:38:01.919 --> 00:38:06.858
Caption: Anton we&#39;ve got about five minutes for

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.859
Caption: questions

00:38:12.479 --> 00:38:16.618
Caption: hey uh thanks for the presentation it&#39;s

00:38:15.419 --> 00:38:19.500
Caption: very good

00:38:16.618 --> 00:38:22.858
Caption: um it&#39;s my Fisto in MCU

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:26.000
Caption: what was that so it&#39;s Mephisto it&#39;s

00:38:22.858 --> 00:38:26.000
Caption: gonna be an MCU

Caption: I can&#39;t do any of their stuff on the web

00:38:31.979 --> 00:38:37.800
Caption: so I have a question what would you

00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:40.260
Caption: advise is the best approach to take for

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.640
Caption: somebody new to using something like CSS

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:44.579
Caption: grid

00:38:41.639 --> 00:38:46.979
Caption: well I mean what this is the way that I

00:38:44.579 --> 00:38:48.540
Caption: learned CSS grid it was the talk is a

00:38:46.979 --> 00:38:49.618
Caption: little bit older now

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.359
Caption: um

00:38:49.618 --> 00:38:53.578
Caption: but linking it with something that you

00:38:51.358 --> 00:38:56.098
Caption: enjoy I think is a good way to learn it

00:38:53.579 --> 00:38:57.900
Caption: I I kind of use some of these comics and

00:38:56.099 --> 00:39:01.380
Caption: and looked at the layouts and I was

00:38:57.899 --> 00:39:03.838
Caption: trying to use Grid in products

00:39:01.379 --> 00:39:05.098
Caption: that designers would send me but it was

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:06.960
Caption: always trying to visualize something

00:39:05.099 --> 00:39:09.900
Caption: that I didn&#39;t quite understand yet

00:39:06.959 --> 00:39:12.358
Caption: because the the layouts that they were

00:39:09.899 --> 00:39:14.159
Caption: doing didn&#39;t have these grids and these

00:39:12.358 --> 00:39:16.019
Caption: structures to it so taking a bit of a

00:39:14.159 --> 00:39:18.439
Caption: step back and starting to work with grid

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:21.599
Caption: with comics in my case

00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:23.939
Caption: uh was nice because it could start off

00:39:21.599 --> 00:39:29.040
Caption: quite simple and then build up to our

00:39:23.939 --> 00:39:30.479
Caption: more advanced uh examples with the sort

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.300
Caption: of breaking out the boxes and starting

00:39:30.479 --> 00:39:35.159
Caption: to combine those techniques together

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:38.219
Caption: so yeah I would say link it with

00:39:35.159 --> 00:39:39.419
Caption: something that you enjoy doing

00:39:38.219 --> 00:39:41.639
