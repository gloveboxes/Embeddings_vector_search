Caption: doing it&#39;s quite fun if you take

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:27.309
Caption: pictures of speakers in their various

00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:29.349

Caption: be getting the prize okay so this was

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.570
Caption: the other slide that gave me a damn

00:03:43.988 --> 00:03:49.300
Caption: embarrassing subtitle because somehow it

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.040
Caption: said that I loved last Clint and that I

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.500
Caption: was going to smother him in his sleep

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:57.429
Caption: that was what the subtitles came up as I

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.889
Caption: don&#39;t want to say anything like that

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:02.369
Caption: about Laz

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.500
Caption: what I was gonna say it was a couple of

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:08.970
Caption: years ago Lars did the luck note for

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.610
Caption: didi deep earth and I was so moved by it

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.819
Caption: it was a really personal Lucknow was

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.190
Caption: anyone here for that yeah it was it was

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.320
Caption: a really really personal Lucknow and I

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.480
Caption: just thought how is this gonna go over

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.369
Caption: with a roomful of developers who surely

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.370
Caption: or they are interested in as the code

00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:28.350
Caption: and know everyone in the wind just

00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:31.679
Caption: opened up and just shared stuff

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.619
Caption: themselves and so it&#39;s really great what

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:35.850
Caption: is Lucknow twas about though was

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:37.709
Caption: thinking about what you want to do of

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.720
Caption: your life where you want to be in five

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:42.329
Caption: years time and you know the kind of job

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.100
Caption: that you want to have and he had looked

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:47.099
Caption: at his life and he said you know why I

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.320
Caption: won the lottery what I would do is go

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.529
Caption: and live on my farm raise an army of

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.110
Caption: robots play with hololens and just tour

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:56.760
Caption: the world and it occurred to him that in

00:04:55.109 --> 00:04:58.799
Caption: fact he didn&#39;t need to win the lottery

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.770
Caption: to do that he could just do that right

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:03.418
Caption: now and there were you know there are

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:05.339
Caption: things that you can do in order to

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.369
Caption: enable the kind of life that you want

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:09.899
Caption: and so he just started doing it and as I

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:12.690
Caption: was listening to him give this look

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:15.449
Caption: notes I thought that is so true I could

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.450
Caption: do that to have the hashtag is be like

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.479
Caption: Lars if you can follow the life that

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.669
Caption: Lars lives and and so that&#39;s what this

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.979
Caption: is kind of about how you can set

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.130
Caption: yourself up how you can position

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.440
Caption: yourself in the market to do whatever

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:37.709
Caption: you want to do without too much extra

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:39.149
Caption: effort from your day job so when you are

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:41.309
Caption: trying to choose what you want to do

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:43.199
Caption: with your life you have a couple of ways

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:47.700
Caption: that you can position yourself for that

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.890
Caption: and either you want to do what Lars does

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.360
Caption: which is just tour the world and talk to

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.820
Caption: people and do training courses and

00:05:51.359 --> 00:05:57.779
Caption: pretty much you know set his own hours

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:59.339
Caption: or you could maybe work for a company

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.079
Caption: within industry and there are certain

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:03.359
Caption: companies that you that might look more

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:05.429
Caption: appealing to you than others but the

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:08.459
Caption: only way to really position yourself for

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:11.220
Caption: those is to set your profile

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:14.160
Caption: right let yourself let the market see

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:21.059
Caption: who you are without you having to put

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:22.529
Caption: any extra justification into it so there

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:23.250
Caption: are a lot of free tools that you can use

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:25.589
Caption: to do that

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.049
Caption: LinkedIn is obviously just part of it

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:30.419
Caption: any of you that are following me on

00:06:28.049 --> 00:06:32.339
Caption: social media know that I use Twitter an

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.679
Caption: awful lot especially at conferences and

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:36.419
Caption: events as well if you&#39;re wondering how

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:38.699
Caption: I&#39;m number one on the Twitter board

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:42.509
Caption: today that is automation we are in

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:44.848
Caption: technology so you know you don&#39;t have to

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:48.750
Caption: do everything manually what I&#39;ve done

00:06:44.848 --> 00:06:51.959
Caption: here is I was reading before I went to

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.059
Caption: MDC Oslo a book by uncle Bob Martin

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:57.750
Caption: called clean codes has anyone read that

00:06:54.059 --> 00:07:00.239
Caption: book so if you have not read clean code

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:03.209
Caption: I would heartily recommend you read it

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:05.429
Caption: it&#39;s a really good book and he lays out

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:07.799
Caption: these principles and he essentially says

00:07:05.429 --> 00:07:10.440
Caption: you want your code to be really clear

00:07:07.799 --> 00:07:12.179
Caption: you want it to be self-explanatory you

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.580
Caption: want people to look at your code and

00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:18.419
Caption: just know what it&#39;s meant to do without

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:20.939
Caption: any kerfuffle around it so it is with

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:23.598
Caption: your LinkedIn profile it should be

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:26.489
Caption: absolutely 100 percent clear who you are

00:07:23.598 --> 00:07:28.408
Caption: from that profile so that you don&#39;t have

00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:30.209
Caption: to go into an interview and defend

00:07:28.408 --> 00:07:32.519
Caption: yourself or you don&#39;t have to meet

00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:34.259
Caption: people and say hey this is all the

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:36.059
Caption: awesome that I am they should already

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:38.279
Caption: know that in advance they should know it

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:41.750
Caption: from what they can see of you from what

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:41.750
Caption: you&#39;re putting out there on the internet

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:52.589
Caption: so I&#39;ve put a few examples here so the

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:54.329
Caption: first one that&#39;s Williams so the biggest

00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:57.269
Caption: problem that I have with Williams is

00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:58.739
Caption: that blue default banner that is fine

00:07:57.269 --> 00:08:01.019
Caption: that is the banner that comes with every

00:07:58.739 --> 00:08:02.940
Caption: LinkedIn profile and if you want to look

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:04.829
Caption: exactly the same as everyone else on the

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.259
Caption: internet and it&#39;s absolutely fine to

00:08:04.829 --> 00:08:09.329
Caption: just leave that as plain however if you

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:11.519
Caption: would like to catch someone&#39;s eye then

00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:14.459
Caption: you could put something else in there

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:17.019
Caption: now you could some people put a nice

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:18.489
Caption: sort of landscape picture in there

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:20.589
Caption: my caching that&#39;s beautiful but it

00:08:18.489 --> 00:08:22.690
Caption: doesn&#39;t do anything to link credibility

00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:25.559
Caption: to your brand and it doesn&#39;t tell

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:29.199
Caption: anything to tell people who you are

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:31.869
Caption: visually so what Jonathan has done there

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:34.570
Caption: that&#39;s the third one he has a chalkboard

00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:37.119
Caption: which is filled with technical symbols

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.098
Caption: what that says just from that image is

00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:42.130
Caption: that he is a teacher and he teaches

00:08:39.098 --> 00:08:43.750
Caption: technical stuff so I mean he&#39;s not a

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.609
Caption: teacher he&#39;s obviously he&#39;s an architect

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.859
Caption: and stuff like that but you can from

00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:50.440
Caption: that image have the impression that the

00:08:47.859 --> 00:08:52.328
Caption: way he shares his information is by

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.500
Caption: teaching and what he teaches is

00:08:52.328 --> 00:08:56.260
Caption: technical

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:59.260
Caption: his profile picture is a picture of him

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:01.838
Caption: speaking at a conference so that also

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:05.190
Caption: lends credibility to his brand right off

00:09:01.838 --> 00:09:07.630
Caption: and says who is an expert in his field

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:11.169
Caption: what I like about antes which is the

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:13.929
Caption: second one is that is a picture of the

00:09:11.169 --> 00:09:16.659
Caption: Redmond campus and in case people didn&#39;t

00:09:13.929 --> 00:09:18.929
Caption: recognize the Redmond campus she&#39;s put a

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:21.519
Caption: little logo in there that says Microsoft

00:09:18.929 --> 00:09:25.119
Caption: what that says is this is Antoinette

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.640
Caption: Jago and she is backed by the might of

00:09:25.119 --> 00:09:29.828
Caption: Microsoft

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:33.970
Caption: she has credibility at her back because

00:09:29.828 --> 00:09:35.919
Caption: of that image what Rob is done is what

00:09:33.969 --> 00:09:38.949
Caption: most of us speakers have done for this

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:42.278
Caption: conference and he has put I am a speaker

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:44.619
Caption: at dddp a lot of the big conferences

00:09:42.278 --> 00:09:46.750
Caption: these days are putting stuff up like

00:09:44.619 --> 00:09:50.679
Caption: that giving them to their speakers so

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:53.140
Caption: that they can spread the brand of the

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:54.849
Caption: conference but it also so it lifts the

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.739
Caption: credibility of the conference and it

00:09:54.849 --> 00:09:59.319
Caption: also lifts the credibility of the

00:09:56.739 --> 00:10:05.679
Caption: speaker and it links their credibility

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:07.570
Caption: together what else is interesting is

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:12.729
Caption: that this is the difference between

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:16.320
Caption: using LinkedIn and using CV a CV when it

00:10:12.729 --> 00:10:16.320
Caption: hits the desk of a recruiter

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:26.720
Caption: my recruiter&#39;s amongst us ran a CV hits

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:28.700
Caption: the desk of a recruiter 200 of them hit

00:10:26.719 --> 00:10:30.709
Caption: that desk at the same time they were all

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.200
Caption: black and white all times new roman&#39;

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.630
Caption: they all have experience they all have

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.489
Caption: qualifications what is the

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.799
Caption: differentiator there what is it that

00:10:37.489 --> 00:10:43.010
Caption: makes your profile stand out from others

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:43.669
Caption: on LinkedIn you have the opportunity to

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.359
Caption: do that

00:10:43.669 --> 00:10:50.539
Caption: so in Robb&#39;s there you can see just

00:10:47.359 --> 00:10:54.109
Caption: under his elevator pitch he has three

00:10:50.539 --> 00:10:56.929
Caption: images that those are videos videos of

00:10:54.109 --> 00:11:00.109
Caption: him speaking at other conferences so if

00:10:56.929 --> 00:11:02.000
Caption: you have something which demonstrates

00:11:00.109 --> 00:11:02.779
Caption: your expertise maybe it&#39;s you giving a

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.359
Caption: presentation

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:08.390
Caption: maybe it&#39;s an article you&#39;ve written on

00:11:05.359 --> 00:11:10.549
Caption: a website maybe it&#39;s even just a photo

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.670
Caption: of you another event you can put those

00:11:10.549 --> 00:11:16.130
Caption: things in demonstrating what you have

00:11:13.669 --> 00:11:18.469
Caption: done what you can do where you have been

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:22.520
Caption: who you have spoken for that kind of

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:24.349
Caption: thing and you can pretty much like your

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.480
Caption: whole profile you can attach stuff link

00:11:24.349 --> 00:11:29.209
Caption: stuff you can add stuff so that someone

00:11:26.479 --> 00:11:31.940
Caption: reading your profile would be able to

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:36.160
Caption: tell very well who you are and what you

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.159
Caption: are expert in just by looking at that

00:11:36.789 --> 00:11:42.199
Caption: the thing that I really loved most and

00:11:39.979 --> 00:11:45.799
Caption: from the start is the recommendations

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:50.840
Caption: because recommendations are essentially

00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:53.599
Caption: references in a blockchain what I mean

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.309
Caption: by that is you can click on the person

00:11:53.599 --> 00:11:58.009
Caption: that has given the recommendation and

00:11:55.309 --> 00:11:59.719
Caption: see who has recommended them you can

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.000
Caption: then click on who has recommended them

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:03.919
Caption: and see who has recommended them and you

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.590
Caption: can follow that chain until you are

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:09.049
Caption: fully reassured that this person is real

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.730
Caption: that this reference is real and that

00:12:09.049 --> 00:12:12.559
Caption: these people have really worked in all

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:14.899
Caption: of these different places because there

00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:16.940
Caption: are absolutely false profiles on the

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.340
Caption: internet no doubt about it

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:22.010
Caption: but here you can check you can check you

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:24.290
Caption: can check which is way better than when

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:26.359
Caption: I moved here to Australia if they wanted

00:12:24.289 --> 00:12:28.018
Caption: to contact one of my references they

00:12:26.359 --> 00:12:30.178
Caption: would have needed to bring Belgium

00:12:28.018 --> 00:12:33.208
Caption: they would have needed to ring someone

00:12:30.179 --> 00:12:36.059
Caption: either out-of-hours Australian time or

00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:38.039
Caption: out of hours Belgium time and speak to

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:40.800
Caption: someone on the end of a foreign phone

00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:44.849
Caption: number in a language which is not their

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:46.859
Caption: first language and but what how could

00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:48.898
Caption: they check that you know hello is this

00:12:46.859 --> 00:12:53.148
Caption: the president of IBM Oh its mission I

00:12:48.898 --> 00:12:57.208
Caption: mean yes it is the president of IBM yes

00:12:53.148 --> 00:13:00.028
Caption: you know the phone call even the email

00:12:57.208 --> 00:13:03.058
Caption: these things are easily faked these days

00:13:00.028 --> 00:13:05.159
Caption: but the recommendations I have more than

00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:07.439
Caption: fifty of those on my profile now and

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:10.919
Caption: those are from people I have worked for

00:13:07.439 --> 00:13:13.199
Caption: people have worked with people who were

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:15.058
Caption: clients of mine customers people that

00:13:13.198 --> 00:13:16.979
Caption: were vendors people that were partners

00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:20.610
Caption: people that were colleagues and people

00:13:16.979 --> 00:13:21.719
Caption: that are friends and by the time you

00:13:20.609 --> 00:13:23.758
Caption: read through all of those

00:13:21.719 --> 00:13:26.188
Caption: recommendations you have a very clear

00:13:23.758 --> 00:13:28.618
Caption: idea of who I am and what it&#39;s like to

00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:30.720
Caption: work with me which is essentially what

00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:32.579
Caption: people are looking for when they are

00:13:30.719 --> 00:13:36.088
Caption: trying to decide whether you are the

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:37.888
Caption: person they want to give the job to what

00:13:36.088 --> 00:13:44.188
Caption: you were like to work with and whether

00:13:37.888 --> 00:13:46.888
Caption: you would fit into their team now people

00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:49.259
Caption: seeing me on social media will often be

00:13:46.888 --> 00:13:51.208
Caption: asking themselves how many hours a day I

00:13:49.258 --> 00:13:54.508
Caption: am on there because surely it must be a

00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:56.669
Caption: lot you only need to spend fifteen

00:13:54.508 --> 00:13:59.998
Caption: minutes a day in order to be number one

00:13:56.669 --> 00:14:02.938
Caption: in the world and all you need to do is

00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:05.910
Caption: walking from your car to your office or

00:14:02.939 --> 00:14:08.189
Caption: while you&#39;re on the train or sometimes

00:14:05.909 --> 00:14:10.198
Caption: when I&#39;m walking from my office up the

00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:12.089
Caption: road to other customers I will be

00:14:10.198 --> 00:14:14.698
Caption: scrolling through my LinkedIn or my

00:14:12.088 --> 00:14:17.338
Caption: Twitter and I will just be liking a few

00:14:14.698 --> 00:14:20.578
Caption: things commenting on a few things and I

00:14:17.338 --> 00:14:22.318
Caption: will make one post in the day when I say

00:14:20.578 --> 00:14:24.838
Caption: commenting on a few things you want to

00:14:22.318 --> 00:14:28.409
Caption: comment specifically on posts that will

00:14:24.838 --> 00:14:30.208
Caption: link you to a field that you are working

00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:32.758
Caption: in or a field that you&#39;re interested in

00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:35.729
Caption: so I did a whole month where I did

00:14:32.758 --> 00:14:37.678
Caption: nothing but share posts around DevOps

00:14:35.729 --> 00:14:39.959
Caption: and that&#39;s because I was learning about

00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:44.010
Caption: DevOps and what I learned

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:45.750
Caption: I shared at the end of that month ratify

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.600
Caption: then asked me to come and speak at a

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:52.080
Caption: customer presentation with them on their

00:14:48.599 --> 00:14:54.449
Caption: box because you have linked your name to

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.610
Caption: the expertise of the topic that you were

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:58.830
Caption: talking about and they don&#39;t think that

00:14:56.609 --> 00:15:00.959
Caption: I am as expert as the people that wrote

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:03.150
Caption: those articles they just know that I

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.130
Caption: understand the story around it because I

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.780
Caption: have been sharing those articles and

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:13.410
Caption: they know exactly how much I know

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:16.260
Caption: because I&#39;ve openly shared it oh the

00:15:13.409 --> 00:15:19.019
Caption: thing about the one poster day though so

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.940
Caption: the one post that is yours in every day

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:23.160

00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:28.589
Caption: you see and you think wow you think this

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:30.390

Caption: happened to you or why that was good or

00:15:35.789 --> 00:15:41.009
Caption: what that was because that thing that is

00:15:38.969 --> 00:15:43.319
Caption: the thing that engages interests people

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:47.880
Caption: are not so interested in you just

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:50.429
Caption: sharing Microsoft or AWS or you know any

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:54.690
Caption: other article they are interested in

00:15:50.429 --> 00:15:56.159

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:58.229
Caption: what you have learned on what you have

00:15:56.159 --> 00:16:00.059

Caption: put some of that you have to put some of

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:06.739
Caption: yourself out there and be authentic

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:06.740
Caption: otherwise it&#39;s not interesting to people

00:16:08.359 --> 00:16:14.700
Caption: now the interesting thing about being

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:17.309
Caption: the number one social seller in the

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.500
Caption: world for Microsoft is not just that we

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:22.020
Caption: are living here in Perth the most most

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.210
Caption: isolated city in the world and that we

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.880
Caption: are tiny little city on the edge of the

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:30.869
Caption: world the most interesting thing about

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:33.000
Caption: that is that I&#39;m not super famous I mean

00:16:30.869 --> 00:16:39.299
Caption: in in Perth obviously we all know each

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.130
Caption: other don&#39;t we but to the rest of the

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:47.369
Caption: world who are we we are nothing right

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:49.710
Caption: and about social media social media

00:16:47.369 --> 00:16:52.200
Caption: knocks down those walls and it takes

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.970
Caption: away the distance between us and it also

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.379
Caption: means

00:16:52.969 --> 00:16:57.258
Caption: that we are all part of something

00:16:54.379 --> 00:16:59.509
Caption: something greater than ourselves so when

00:16:57.258 --> 00:17:04.338
Caption: I became number one for Microsoft in

00:16:59.508 --> 00:17:06.408
Caption: Australia I had 2,000 followers and I

00:17:04.338 --> 00:17:08.958
Caption: asked the guy who was the number one in

00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:11.620
Caption: the world the number one person in the

00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:16.548
Caption: world for Microsoft was called Fabio

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:20.298
Caption: he&#39;s Italian you might guess and Fabio

00:17:16.548 --> 00:17:24.469
Caption: had 20,000 followers and I just thought

00:17:20.298 --> 00:17:26.000
Caption: well I have 2,000 he has 20,000 I&#39;m not

00:17:24.469 --> 00:17:27.890
Caption: gonna be able to be number one in the

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.010
Caption: world I&#39;m you know I should just be

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:33.169
Caption: happy with being number one in Australia

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:36.349
Caption: however I looked at what Fabio was doing

00:17:33.168 --> 00:17:38.899
Caption: the liking the commenting the sharing

00:17:36.349 --> 00:17:41.418
Caption: the posting and I just thought that&#39;s

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.099
Caption: not so hard I could do that I could

00:17:41.418 --> 00:17:46.459
Caption: easily do that and I started doing that

00:17:43.099 --> 00:17:48.558
Caption: exactly what he was doing and I became

00:17:46.459 --> 00:17:52.760
Caption: number one in the world now during that

00:17:48.558 --> 00:17:56.058
Caption: time I reached 4,000 followers so that

00:17:52.760 --> 00:18:00.969
Caption: took me a year to reach 4,000 followers

00:17:56.058 --> 00:18:04.399
Caption: and Fabio reached 55 thousand followers

00:18:00.969 --> 00:18:06.949
Caption: but I am number one in the world not

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:10.849
Caption: Fabio the reason being it&#39;s not about me

00:18:06.949 --> 00:18:13.699
Caption: it is about the power of my network it

00:18:10.849 --> 00:18:16.069
Caption: is what you my friends bring to me and

00:18:13.699 --> 00:18:19.099
Caption: what you will bring to me is your

00:18:16.069 --> 00:18:22.869
Caption: networks and so it might be that there

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:26.479
Caption: is someone in this room possibly Donna

00:18:22.869 --> 00:18:29.150
Caption: that has a massive network maybe one of

00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:31.760
Caption: you has a million followers and I don&#39;t

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:34.460
Caption: know about that because when that person

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:37.130
Caption: engages with me and engages with my

00:18:34.459 --> 00:18:40.099
Caption: posts my posts hit their network as well

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:42.168
Caption: and so my name spreads not just through

00:18:40.099 --> 00:18:44.209
Caption: my network but through the networks of

00:18:42.168 --> 00:18:47.029
Caption: all the people that are engaging with me

00:18:44.209 --> 00:18:49.219
Caption: and so when you like someone&#39;s posts you

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.320
Caption: are helping them not just helping

00:18:49.219 --> 00:18:54.469
Caption: yourself and when you comment you are

00:18:51.319 --> 00:18:56.899
Caption: helping them because you are sharing you

00:18:54.469 --> 00:18:59.719
Caption: are sharing to your streams as well but

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:02.710
Caption: both review eyes together that&#39;s the

00:18:59.719 --> 00:19:02.709
Caption: that&#39;s the beauty

00:19:04.808 --> 00:19:10.849
Caption: so this was yeah first of all when

00:19:07.759 --> 00:19:12.649
Caption: people and when people start using

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:14.629
Caption: social media they&#39;re a little bit afraid

00:19:12.649 --> 00:19:16.489
Caption: to put themselves out there and they

00:19:14.629 --> 00:19:18.409
Caption: think what you know I don&#39;t have

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:22.219
Caption: anything to say I don&#39;t have anything

00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:24.950
Caption: that is smart enough or interesting

00:19:22.219 --> 00:19:27.888
Caption: enough or serious enough or credible

00:19:24.949 --> 00:19:30.109
Caption: enough or or whatever so that&#39;s where

00:19:27.889 --> 00:19:32.479
Caption: you start by taking the content that has

00:19:30.109 --> 00:19:36.499
Caption: already been professionally written by

00:19:32.479 --> 00:19:40.339
Caption: someone like Microsoft or RAC

00:19:36.499 --> 00:19:42.169
Caption: or whoever it is and you share that

00:19:40.339 --> 00:19:44.839
Caption: thing but you don&#39;t just share that

00:19:42.168 --> 00:19:48.109
Caption: thing you say what it was that you liked

00:19:44.839 --> 00:19:49.908
Caption: about the thing so you know I&#39;m sharing

00:19:48.109 --> 00:19:51.798
Caption: this PowerShell article because it

00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:53.889
Caption: taught me that there are only three

00:19:51.798 --> 00:19:57.229
Caption: things I need to know about how I shall

00:19:53.889 --> 00:19:59.479
Caption: just putting that personal spin over the

00:19:57.229 --> 00:20:02.479
Caption: top of it will change your engagement on

00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:04.339
Caption: that post so if you would just share it

00:20:02.479 --> 00:20:07.158
Caption: with no comment at all you will get

00:20:04.339 --> 00:20:09.469
Caption: about 20 views if you share it with

00:20:07.159 --> 00:20:10.999
Caption: three lines over the top about what you

00:20:09.469 --> 00:20:13.689
Caption: found interesting or what you learnt

00:20:10.999 --> 00:20:17.450
Caption: then you will get several hundred views

00:20:13.689 --> 00:20:20.298
Caption: if you wrote the post yourself about how

00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:27.109

Caption: views it&#39;s not because it&#39;s not because

00:20:39.769 --> 00:20:43.789
Caption: we want to be popular that&#39;s not what

00:20:41.928 --> 00:20:45.648
Caption: it&#39;s about it&#39;s about putting your name

Caption: just work however we want to and that

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:36.830
Caption: post got 37,000 views that the reason it

00:22:34.489 --> 00:22:38.630
Caption: got so many views is because he was I

00:22:36.829 --> 00:22:43.909
Caption: think because he was frowning in that

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:46.010
Caption: photo so he wasn&#39;t standing there posing

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:48.530

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:53.510
Caption: really working and he was frowning

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:56.540
Caption: because he was actually on the phone to

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:58.570
Caption: a customer and he&#39;s trying to answer

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:02.330
Caption: their problem whilst holding a baby

00:22:58.569 --> 00:23:04.519
Caption: that&#39;s real life and that&#39;s real life

00:23:02.329 --> 00:23:06.739
Caption: happening and it&#39;s insight into what

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.719
Caption: it&#39;s like to work at your company which

00:23:06.739 --> 00:23:11.030
Caption: people always want to see what is it

00:23:08.719 --> 00:23:14.479
Caption: like to work at another company and they

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:15.080
Caption: want it to look real and that that was

00:23:14.479 --> 00:23:18.169
Caption: real

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:19.569
Caption: there was only one snarky comment that I

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:22.480
Caption: got on that

00:23:19.569 --> 00:23:24.250
Caption: and some guy said I don&#39;t think that&#39;s

00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:27.489
Caption: really a good work-life balance he

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:29.439
Caption: should have been able to just take the

00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:30.929
Caption: day off and you know take care of his

00:23:29.439 --> 00:23:37.329
Caption: baby

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:39.970
Caption: which is interesting well I just said

00:23:37.329 --> 00:23:42.189
Caption: hey if you wanted to take the day off

00:23:39.969 --> 00:23:44.559
Caption: and spend the day with his baby he could

00:23:42.189 --> 00:23:47.229
Caption: do that that&#39;s up to him if he wants to

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.520
Caption: work from home with his baby he could do

00:23:47.229 --> 00:23:51.549
Caption: that that&#39;s up to him

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:54.310
Caption: but if he wants to bring his baby in and

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:56.170
Caption: do his job anyway because he can because

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:59.010
Caption: it is a pretty quiet baby she never

00:23:56.170 --> 00:24:02.230
Caption: cries then he can totally do that and

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:03.910
Caption: you know that&#39;s that&#39;s true that&#39;s the

00:24:02.229 --> 00:24:06.309
Caption: world we live in that is the kind of

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:10.060
Caption: workplace that we live in and that&#39;s

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:12.130
Caption: what&#39;s interesting to people so you know

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:14.010
Caption: just what you see what you do where you

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:16.089
Caption: go that&#39;s what people want to know about

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:19.150
Caption: the other one that was really popular

00:24:16.089 --> 00:24:20.799
Caption: was when I went to Redmond and there&#39;s a

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:23.979
Caption: bunch of tree houses there that are

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:27.369
Caption: meeting rooms and people love tree

00:24:23.979 --> 00:24:29.589
Caption: houses the idea that you could abandon

00:24:27.369 --> 00:24:30.550
Caption: your office and sit in a tree and work

00:24:29.589 --> 00:24:34.510
Caption: there all day

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:36.970
Caption: that&#39;s a wonderful wonderful thing so

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:40.660
Caption: yeah those are the those are the things

00:24:36.969 --> 00:24:45.640
Caption: so 38k for Jason and his baby 5k for the

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:48.190
Caption: for the tree houses 19k I got four I

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.500
Caption: spoke at a Google conference and I

00:24:48.189 --> 00:24:52.209
Caption: forgot to take a picture of myself at

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.550
Caption: the Google conference which would have

00:24:52.209 --> 00:24:56.589
Caption: been better and so I literally just took

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:58.239
Caption: a picture of myself at my desk when I

00:24:56.589 --> 00:25:01.959
Caption: got back and said I forgot to take the

00:24:58.239 --> 00:25:04.000
Caption: picture nobody nobody cares that&#39;s not

00:25:01.959 --> 00:25:06.309
Caption: what interesting what is interesting is

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.859
Caption: that you&#39;re telling the story about who

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:10.990
Caption: you are where you went what you did and

00:25:08.859 --> 00:25:15.010
Caption: what it was like that is interesting to

00:25:10.989 --> 00:25:17.619
Caption: people and the other one 13.5 K that was

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:19.930
Caption: when Satya gave every single employee in

00:25:17.619 --> 00:25:23.670
Caption: the company a copy of his book and they

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:26.530
Caption: were all annotated

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:30.540
Caption: yeah with all these little scribblings

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:30.540
Caption: and notes that he had made just for us

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:37.809
Caption: so if you want to be a leader you have

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:40.270
Caption: to have followers so when I first

00:25:37.808 --> 00:25:43.149
Caption: started stalking Fabio to see what he

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:45.070
Caption: was doing so well I thought he was the

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:47.830
Caption: it&#39;s not just that he had 20,000

00:25:45.069 --> 00:25:50.889
Caption: followers it&#39;s that he was the head of

00:25:47.829 --> 00:25:51.489
Caption: the services and consulting business in

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.500
Caption: Italy

00:25:51.489 --> 00:25:56.410
Caption: so he&#39;s the head of a whole division and

00:25:53.500 --> 00:26:00.520
Caption: he&#39;s writing all of these articles for

00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:05.290
Caption: CIOs on CIO thought leadership and I

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:08.890
Caption: just thought wow imagine each of us has

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:11.470
Caption: the power to influence all of the CIOs

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:14.979
Caption: all of the the technical leadership

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:18.760
Caption: within our town by using a tool like

00:26:14.979 --> 00:26:22.089
Caption: this by just writing down our ideas and

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:24.160
Caption: those people will read them and of

00:26:22.089 --> 00:26:25.959
Caption: course they won&#39;t necessarily read them

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.510
Caption: if that&#39;s not your target audience so

00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:31.089
Caption: maybe you&#39;re maybe you like to write

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:34.750
Caption: deep technical stuff in which case your

00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:36.699
Caption: target audience is developers and then

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.770
Caption: hopefully it&#39;s developers that are

00:26:36.699 --> 00:26:40.928
Caption: reading your staff or people that want

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:45.459
Caption: to become developers but it could be

00:26:40.928 --> 00:26:49.109
Caption: that you want to put yourself up there

00:26:45.459 --> 00:26:51.959
Caption: as someone who is a thought leader for

00:26:49.109 --> 00:26:55.750
Caption: digital or for transformation or for

00:26:51.959 --> 00:26:58.149
Caption: CIOs or whatever and so those articles

00:26:55.750 --> 00:27:00.939
Caption: that you write those set the tone for

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:02.920
Caption: your profile and you know liking and

00:27:00.939 --> 00:27:06.189
Caption: commenting on other similar articles

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.530
Caption: also establish you as that person so

00:27:06.189 --> 00:27:10.839
Caption: maybe you aren&#39;t that person today but

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:12.219
Caption: the more of the Articles that you write

00:27:10.839 --> 00:27:15.130
Caption: the more that you learn the more that

00:27:12.219 --> 00:27:17.890
Caption: you do it you will become that person by

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:19.808
Caption: the time someone wants to recruit you

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:24.400
Caption: into their business for being that

00:27:19.808 --> 00:27:26.020
Caption: person or in that case like laughs maybe

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.359
Caption: you don&#39;t want to work for anyone&#39;s

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:30.640
Caption: business maybe you just want to do it

00:27:28.359 --> 00:27:33.479
Caption: for yourself maybe Lars is not a good

00:27:33.479 --> 00:27:38.849
Caption: say that because laws has taken a job

00:27:36.428 --> 00:27:38.849
Caption: for

00:27:40.089 --> 00:27:48.199
Caption: yeah yeah but you know that&#39;s your it

00:27:46.369 --> 00:27:50.390
Caption: should be a choice if you position

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:53.329
Caption: yourself well then you can choose who

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:54.890
Caption: you want to work for and they should

00:27:53.329 --> 00:27:56.449

00:27:54.890 --> 00:28:02.150
Caption: coming to you because it should be so

00:27:56.449 --> 00:28:04.099
Caption: obvious the good thing is when you first

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:06.229
Caption: start writing articles and you&#39;re

00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:07.668
Caption: worried that maybe if you write an

00:28:06.229 --> 00:28:10.308
Caption: article people are gonna think it&#39;s

00:28:07.668 --> 00:28:13.609
Caption: stupid and it&#39;s not good enough it&#39;s not

00:28:10.308 --> 00:28:15.619
Caption: worthy or whatever the good thing is

00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:17.209
Caption: when you write your first article the

00:28:15.619 --> 00:28:21.048
Caption: only person that&#39;s going to be reading

00:28:17.209 --> 00:28:23.390
Caption: that is your mum your wife or your

00:28:21.048 --> 00:28:29.119
Caption: husband maybe actually I don&#39;t think my

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:30.950
Caption: husband reads my article so yeah if you

00:28:29.119 --> 00:28:32.569
Caption: don&#39;t have a lot of followers then no

00:28:30.949 --> 00:28:35.089
Caption: one&#39;s gonna be seeing your stuff and no

00:28:32.569 --> 00:28:40.069
Caption: one&#39;s gonna be reading it and so you can

00:28:35.089 --> 00:28:41.928
Caption: ride it you can edit it if someone comes

00:28:40.069 --> 00:28:43.459
Caption: to you and writes a comment on there

00:28:41.928 --> 00:28:45.349
Caption: saying this is really stupid you didn&#39;t

00:28:43.459 --> 00:28:47.209
Caption: talk about such-and-such you can edit

00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:50.209
Caption: that article you can talk about

00:28:47.209 --> 00:28:52.969
Caption: such-and-such if you want to and then

00:28:50.209 --> 00:28:55.339
Caption: you can say hey I&#39;ve changed it what do

00:28:52.969 --> 00:28:57.109
Caption: you think now and give them a chance to

00:28:55.339 --> 00:28:58.579
Caption: you like it if they&#39;re still a dick

00:28:57.109 --> 00:29:04.189
Caption: about it and you can just delete that

00:28:58.579 --> 00:29:09.529
Caption: comment as well so there&#39;s literally no

00:29:04.189 --> 00:29:12.558
Caption: risk I set myself a target to sort of

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:14.809
Caption: write you know one per week when I had

00:29:12.558 --> 00:29:16.459
Caption: no articles and I would think about what

00:29:14.808 --> 00:29:18.770
Caption: was the thing that I&#39;d kind of discussed

00:29:16.459 --> 00:29:20.298
Caption: with people during the week it tends to

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:22.040
Caption: be that there&#39;s something that some

00:29:20.298 --> 00:29:24.769
Caption: people&#39;s minds you have a conversation

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.600
Caption: with someone and then later in the week

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.820
Caption: you say oh hey I was just talking about

00:29:26.599 --> 00:29:32.900
Caption: that with such-and-such what do you

00:29:28.819 --> 00:29:34.219
Caption: think and then you say hey you did you

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.719

Caption: talking about it with this guy earlier

00:29:35.719 --> 00:29:40.308
Caption: and as you sort of iterate on that

00:29:38.298 --> 00:29:41.329
Caption: conversation over the week by the time

00:29:40.308 --> 00:29:43.579
Caption: you&#39;ve come to the end of the week

00:29:41.329 --> 00:29:45.199

Caption: like and you can sort of write that down

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:55.969
Caption: and that should only take you like 15-20

00:29:53.359 --> 00:29:58.428

Caption: careers I&#39;ve written ones about getting

00:30:33.949 --> 00:30:40.969
Caption: rejected because no matter how great you

00:30:38.178 --> 00:30:43.069
Caption: are no matter what if you put yourself

00:30:40.969 --> 00:30:45.319
Caption: out there you will be rejected people

00:30:43.069 --> 00:30:47.268
Caption: love my articles about rejection because

00:30:45.319 --> 00:30:52.069
Caption: it turns out I&#39;m not the only one being

00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:54.080
Caption: picked people or get rejected and so if

00:30:52.069 --> 00:30:56.268
Caption: you can share something that you have

00:30:54.079 --> 00:31:00.678
Caption: learnt from a time that you failed

00:30:56.269 --> 00:31:04.399
Caption: that&#39;s useful to people I should say

00:31:00.678 --> 00:31:07.010
Caption: that during this presentation I am

00:31:04.399 --> 00:31:10.610
Caption: tweeting out extra links to extra

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:11.779
Caption: content and also some of the slides and

00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:12.709
Caption: stuff like that so if you&#39;re following

00:31:11.779 --> 00:31:15.649
Caption: on Twitter

00:31:12.709 --> 00:31:20.709
Caption: you should see those extra things coming

00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:23.389
Caption: out as well do you know what this is

00:31:20.709 --> 00:31:30.768
Caption: does anyone recognize what this is meant

00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:32.539
Caption: to be Harry Potter&#39;s but it has a

00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:35.269
Caption: lightning bolt to remind me to talk

00:31:32.538 --> 00:31:37.518
Caption: about the electric superhighway that

00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:41.809
Caption: travels all the way up the west coast of

00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:46.340
Caption: Australia and well what else would it be

00:31:41.808 --> 00:31:49.189
Caption: in waa that we have that&#39;s magic be

00:31:46.339 --> 00:31:52.189
Caption: autonomous buses yes

00:31:49.189 --> 00:31:54.228
Caption: so it wasn&#39;t actually that far off when

00:31:52.189 --> 00:32:00.998
Caption: you said Harry Potter because it is a

00:31:54.229 --> 00:32:04.729
Caption: Magic Bus this is our AC Magic Bus

00:32:00.999 --> 00:32:05.749
Caption: autonomous bus as I believe people

00:32:04.729 --> 00:32:08.259
Caption: formerly call it

00:32:05.749 --> 00:32:11.719
Caption: I do call it the Magic Bus all the time

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:12.139
Caption: the reason I mentioned that RA see Magic

00:32:11.719 --> 00:32:15.499
Caption: Bus

00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:18.710
Caption: is because RAC are one of the companies

00:32:15.499 --> 00:32:21.830
Caption: the ease is linked in really well and if

00:32:18.709 --> 00:32:24.709
Caption: you follow them as a company you will

00:32:21.829 --> 00:32:27.768
Caption: see that everything they post links them

00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:30.798
Caption: to innovation links them to community

00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:32.919
Caption: links them to good things actually you

00:32:30.798 --> 00:32:35.748
Caption: know a bank west also do it

00:32:32.918 --> 00:32:39.098
Caption: Congress also do it really well a lot of

00:32:35.749 --> 00:32:42.469
Caption: stuff around community and around

00:32:39.098 --> 00:32:46.279
Caption: bringing up tech innovation and stuff

00:32:42.469 --> 00:32:49.308
Caption: like that so if you have a company or

00:32:46.279 --> 00:32:51.440
Caption: you you yourself of company page then

00:32:49.308 --> 00:32:54.619
Caption: that&#39;s the kind of stuff that&#39;s it&#39;s

00:32:51.439 --> 00:32:58.098
Caption: really easy to do post stuff that your

00:32:54.619 --> 00:33:02.029
Caption: company does well for the community or

00:32:58.098 --> 00:33:06.439
Caption: around innovation and then you&#39;re then

00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:09.200
Caption: you can employ empower your employees to

00:33:06.439 --> 00:33:11.748
Caption: advocate on your behalf so it&#39;s easy for

00:33:09.199 --> 00:33:14.329
Caption: me to share stuff about RAC or about

00:33:11.749 --> 00:33:16.820
Caption: bank rest because the stuff that they

00:33:14.329 --> 00:33:19.428
Caption: share is stuff that I would like to be

00:33:16.819 --> 00:33:23.598
Caption: associated with that innovation that

00:33:19.428 --> 00:33:28.579
Caption: that helping the community magic

00:33:23.598 --> 00:33:31.009
Caption: obviously and then you know if it&#39;s easy

00:33:28.579 --> 00:33:34.278
Caption: for your employees to share then all of

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:37.129
Caption: that there were some companies that do

00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:38.899
Caption: not encourage their employees to post

00:33:37.129 --> 00:33:40.669
Caption: anything on social media about their

00:33:38.899 --> 00:33:42.499
Caption: company they will say you know it needs

00:33:40.668 --> 00:33:45.079
Caption: to go before the lawyers and stuff like

00:33:42.499 --> 00:33:46.789
Caption: that this is a whole new world that we

00:33:45.079 --> 00:33:50.469
Caption: are in now and if you&#39;re in one of those

00:33:46.788 --> 00:33:52.969
Caption: companies I feel I feel bad for you

00:33:50.469 --> 00:33:54.979
Caption: because you can&#39;t have any fun with it

00:33:52.969 --> 00:33:57.260
Caption: and your company could be benefiting

00:33:54.979 --> 00:34:08.148
Caption: from the enthusiasm that you

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:10.820
Caption: for your marvelous company so I realized

00:34:08.148 --> 00:34:12.348
Caption: that I am totally don&#39;t know what time

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.859
Caption: I&#39;m supposed to finish what time we&#39;re

00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:19.129
Caption: supposed to finish ten minutes okay cool

00:34:15.858 --> 00:34:27.678
Caption: so how many of you would consider

00:34:19.128 --> 00:34:29.209
Caption: yourselves an introvert I would think

00:34:27.678 --> 00:34:30.888
Caption: that probably the ones that are super

00:34:29.209 --> 00:34:37.398
Caption: introverts though didn&#39;t raise their

00:34:30.888 --> 00:34:41.059
Caption: hands at all and so yeah I I find myself

00:34:37.398 --> 00:34:43.280
Caption: very anxious at tech conferences less so

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:46.540
Caption: with this one because we all know each

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:50.689
Caption: other and we&#39;re all friends here but

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:52.849
Caption: normally you know it&#39;s very it&#39;s I get

00:34:50.689 --> 00:34:55.280
Caption: very anxious inside the idea that there

00:34:52.849 --> 00:34:57.560
Caption: is a whole room of people and you need

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.780
Caption: to make friends you need to network and

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.459
Caption: otherwise you&#39;re kind of wasting half of

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:06.439
Caption: your money at a conference if you

00:35:01.459 --> 00:35:07.790
Caption: haven&#39;t done that it&#39;s really distracted

00:35:06.439 --> 00:35:15.199
Caption: them because you just looked like

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:17.390
Caption: someone that mentors me in the u.s. so I

00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:21.139
Caption: invented these games to try and help me

00:35:17.389 --> 00:35:22.939
Caption: when I went to conferences and what I

00:35:21.139 --> 00:35:24.799
Caption: would do is before I go to the

00:35:22.939 --> 00:35:26.389
Caption: conference I would take out a load of

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.119
Caption: pictures from the one sheet of the

00:35:26.389 --> 00:35:30.769
Caption: speakers that I want to meet when I am

00:35:29.118 --> 00:35:33.139
Caption: there and then I would put them in a

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:36.380
Caption: collage and then I would say I&#39;m really

00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:39.078
Caption: excited to you go to NBC Sydney because

00:35:36.379 --> 00:35:40.848
Caption: I can&#39;t wait to see the sessions of

00:35:39.079 --> 00:35:42.650
Caption: these speakers and then I would tag them

00:35:40.849 --> 00:35:47.450
Caption: all in maybe talk about companies as

00:35:42.649 --> 00:35:49.520
Caption: well put a nice photo up and then wait a

00:35:47.449 --> 00:35:51.229
Caption: little bit then they were generally

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.939
Caption: because they are tagged in there they

00:35:51.229 --> 00:35:54.530
Caption: would see it so then they would like the

00:35:52.939 --> 00:35:56.088
Caption: post then I would send them all

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.709
Caption: connection requests saying hey I&#39;m

00:35:56.089 --> 00:36:00.829
Caption: really looking forward to seeing you at

00:35:57.709 --> 00:36:02.868
Caption: MDC Sydney I hope we can connect they

00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:04.849
Caption: will all accept your connection requests

00:36:02.868 --> 00:36:06.549
Caption: because you have spooked their session

00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:09.010
Caption: and so therefore it

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:10.600
Caption: a form of social currency you have done

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:12.130
Caption: something for them they want to thank

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.720
Caption: you for it they don&#39;t want to be in your

00:36:12.129 --> 00:36:19.269
Caption: debt nobody wants to be in anyone&#39;s debt

00:36:15.719 --> 00:36:21.489
Caption: so they accept it and then in fact they

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:23.439
Caption: are they they want to now do something

00:36:21.489 --> 00:36:28.149
Caption: more for you so that you become in their

00:36:23.439 --> 00:36:30.280
Caption: debt yeah let&#39;s get a beer or let&#39;s get

00:36:28.149 --> 00:36:32.319
Caption: a coffee and so when you get to the

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:35.530
Caption: conference instead of having to queue up

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:38.110
Caption: to speak to the speaker you in fact have

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:41.169
Caption: already met them beforehand or after for

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:43.120
Caption: a drink your automates and then if you

00:36:41.169 --> 00:36:45.309
Caption: keep in contact with them over Twitter

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.810
Caption: during the year maybe just occasionally

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:48.729
Caption: responding to one of their tweets or

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:50.080
Caption: spooking one of their sessions by the

00:36:48.729 --> 00:36:52.080
Caption: time you see the next year at the

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:55.540
Caption: conference she really are best mates

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:58.090
Caption: because social media accelerates the

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:00.280
Caption: connection that you make so you only

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:01.930
Caption: need to make that one physical

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:05.890
Caption: connection and then the second time

00:37:01.929 --> 00:37:07.809
Caption: you&#39;re good whereas in real life if you

00:37:05.889 --> 00:37:10.719
Caption: met someone once and then you had

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:12.790
Caption: nothing to tie you to them in the whole

00:37:10.719 --> 00:37:14.830
Caption: year in between you saw them at the

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:19.650
Caption: conference again they probably wouldn&#39;t

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:19.650
Caption: remember you so it&#39;s it&#39;s an accelerant

00:37:23.729 --> 00:37:28.359
Caption: it&#39;s I do it all the time I literally do

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.479
Caption: it for every single conference because

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:33.310
Caption: it not just helps me make friends with

00:37:31.479 --> 00:37:35.379
Caption: all the other speakers but I can also

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:37.030
Caption: see what attendees are coming sometimes

00:37:35.379 --> 00:37:38.829
Caption: as well because they will comment on the

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:41.169
Caption: post saying yeah I&#39;m going to that

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:43.930
Caption: conference - I can&#39;t wait or can we meet

00:37:41.169 --> 00:37:45.760
Caption: up and it means that I don&#39;t have to

00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:47.649
Caption: search people out and make friends with

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.270
Caption: them people search for me and make

00:37:47.649 --> 00:37:53.559
Caption: friends with me which is much less

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:55.149
Caption: upsetting when you are shy that&#39;s a hint

00:37:53.560 --> 00:38:03.070
Caption: by the way you should come and talk to

00:37:55.149 --> 00:38:05.649
Caption: me so that I don&#39;t give people a reason

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:07.900
Caption: to accept your connection or to connect

00:38:05.649 --> 00:38:10.569
Caption: you and they generally will so a lot of

00:38:07.899 --> 00:38:13.479
Caption: people say to me I only accept

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:16.130
Caption: connections from people that I know now

00:38:13.479 --> 00:38:18.050
Caption: that was really no point in use

00:38:16.129 --> 00:38:19.909
Caption: like that you may as well just be

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:21.380
Caption: walking up and down the terrace shaking

00:38:19.909 --> 00:38:26.059
Caption: hands of people and handing out your

00:38:21.379 --> 00:38:28.189
Caption: business card old school because then it

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:29.840
Caption: means that your network can only ever be

00:38:28.189 --> 00:38:32.179
Caption: people you know and you will never

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.969
Caption: receive an offer to work at a company

00:38:32.179 --> 00:38:37.879
Caption: that you don&#39;t work at because you don&#39;t

00:38:34.969 --> 00:38:40.310
Caption: have any connections there so you know

00:38:37.879 --> 00:38:41.779
Caption: he in order to open up your

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:44.150
Caption: opportunities to the whole wide world

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:46.010
Caption: you need to reach out and you need to

00:38:44.149 --> 00:38:48.049
Caption: make connections at those companies you

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:49.909
Caption: want to work at or places in the world

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:51.709
Caption: that you want to work in or with people

00:38:49.909 --> 00:38:54.139
Caption: who have a similar career to the one

00:38:51.709 --> 00:38:55.969
Caption: that you want so that you can get that

00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:58.489
Caption: inspiration that advice and have those

00:38:55.969 --> 00:39:00.590
Caption: connections if you give them a reason to

00:38:58.489 --> 00:39:02.330
Caption: connect you they absolutely will so all

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:03.979
Caption: you have to say is hey looking forward

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:11.959
Caption: to seeing your session there and DC

00:39:03.979 --> 00:39:13.399
Caption: Sydney Donna&#39;s got to you know hey I

00:39:11.959 --> 00:39:17.449
Caption: really liked meeting you the other night

00:39:13.399 --> 00:39:19.520
Caption: at that event or hey and I would really

00:39:17.449 --> 00:39:22.310
Caption: like to work for Microsoft one day I

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:25.219
Caption: wonder if I could just connect you for

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:28.130
Caption: you know advice but try not to make it

00:39:25.219 --> 00:39:33.340
Caption: too cumbersome just you know make it

00:39:28.129 --> 00:39:36.439
Caption: easy for them to say yes if you think

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:38.540
Caption: that posting a lot of stuff on social

00:39:36.439 --> 00:39:41.300
Caption: media makes you look big headed

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:43.850
Caption: especially if the aim was to raise your

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:46.160
Caption: profile so that you could attract a

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:50.210
Caption: better job or better offers or whatever

00:39:46.159 --> 00:39:54.049
Caption: then think of those other examples that

00:39:50.209 --> 00:39:56.300
Caption: I gave you I&#39;m generally raising other

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:59.120
Caption: people up in those posts and I&#39;m

00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:00.920
Caption: hitching my credibility to them so in

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.890
Caption: those ones where I have the picture of

00:40:00.919 --> 00:40:07.399
Caption: all of the speakers I am spooking their

00:40:03.889 --> 00:40:09.799
Caption: sessions not me but incidentally my

00:40:07.399 --> 00:40:12.949
Caption: credibility is linked to theirs because

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:14.959
Caption: I have I have spooked them and so

00:40:12.949 --> 00:40:17.089
Caption: therefore we rise together we always

00:40:14.959 --> 00:40:19.580
Caption: together that is the points that you

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:21.350
Caption: don&#39;t you don&#39;t have to stand that and

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:25.070
Caption: say hey look at me you can say hey look

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:26.000
Caption: at us when I became the chairman of the

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:29.750
Caption: AC

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.909
Caption: I didn&#39;t put a picture of me saying hey

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:35.209
Caption: I&#39;m the chairman I put a picture of me

00:40:31.909 --> 00:40:37.219
Caption: surrounded by my entire branch executive

00:40:35.209 --> 00:40:39.679
Caption: committee and said hey this is my new

00:40:37.219 --> 00:40:41.389
Caption: branch executive committee these are all

00:40:39.679 --> 00:40:44.358
Caption: the people that have been elected to

00:40:41.389 --> 00:40:47.629
Caption: serve the Australian Computer Society&#39;s

00:40:44.358 --> 00:40:51.199
Caption: membership in the year ahead but because

00:40:47.629 --> 00:40:53.269
Caption: you know it&#39;s it&#39;s easier to talk about

00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:56.209
Caption: other people and to raise other people

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:57.709
Caption: up than to talk about yourself then you

00:40:56.209 --> 00:41:00.108
Caption: don&#39;t have to feel embarrassed or shy

00:40:57.709 --> 00:41:04.179
Caption: you can you can talk about your team

00:41:00.108 --> 00:41:04.179
Caption: around you and you will always together

00:41:05.618 --> 00:41:11.659
Caption: so the story that I normally start with

00:41:09.409 --> 00:41:13.489
Caption: and I thought I would finish with here

00:41:11.659 --> 00:41:17.179
Caption: is the one that made it really obvious

00:41:13.489 --> 00:41:21.049
Caption: to me what the value was here so I had

00:41:17.179 --> 00:41:23.659
Caption: gone to a big gala dinner for waiter

00:41:21.049 --> 00:41:28.670
Caption: it&#39;s the waa IT tech awards that ones

00:41:23.659 --> 00:41:31.760
Caption: every year I was super super conscious

00:41:28.669 --> 00:41:33.649
Caption: that as the vice chair as I was then at

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:35.750
Caption: the ACS and someone who worked for

00:41:33.649 --> 00:41:38.689
Caption: Microsoft I needed to really work that

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:41.540
Caption: room there were adding a five to six

00:41:38.689 --> 00:41:43.818
Caption: hundred people there and I am they&#39;re

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:47.030
Caption: all like you know a lot of high up

00:41:43.819 --> 00:41:50.150
Caption: Executive people and I&#39;m really I was

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:52.699
Caption: really anxious really nervous so I

00:41:50.149 --> 00:41:54.529
Caption: arrived about an hour early so that I

00:41:52.699 --> 00:41:56.598
Caption: could stand on the sidelines and just

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:59.179
Caption: sort of scope out the room and look at

00:41:56.599 --> 00:42:01.460
Caption: the people as they were coming in and I

00:41:59.179 --> 00:42:06.229
Caption: would see who would probably not eat me

00:42:01.459 --> 00:42:07.939
Caption: if I went and approached them so I saw

00:42:06.229 --> 00:42:09.439
Caption: someone I need talking to someone I

00:42:07.939 --> 00:42:11.808
Caption: didn&#39;t know and thought this will be

00:42:09.439 --> 00:42:16.010
Caption: fine this will be a soft entry so I went

00:42:11.809 --> 00:42:18.799
Caption: over and said hey um hi and he said hey

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:20.899
Caption: Michelle do you know blah blah he is the

00:42:18.799 --> 00:42:28.219
Caption: CTO of the department of big government

00:42:20.899 --> 00:42:30.469
Caption: things and I respect I just immediately

00:42:28.219 --> 00:42:32.299
Caption: started really panicking there because I

00:42:30.469 --> 00:42:34.848
Caption: was like oh my god the first one in

00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:37.119
Caption: someone really important in government I

00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:40.150
Caption: didn&#39;t have physical access

00:42:37.118 --> 00:42:42.909
Caption: to meet it&#39;s really important that I

00:42:40.149 --> 00:42:45.608
Caption: make a good impression I have about 20

00:42:42.909 --> 00:42:49.088
Caption: seconds now to say something significant

00:42:45.608 --> 00:42:51.248
Caption: to him so that he will not forget me and

00:42:49.089 --> 00:42:52.839
Caption: all I really want to say is excuse me so

00:42:51.249 --> 00:42:59.229
Caption: that I can run away to the bathroom and

00:42:52.839 --> 00:43:01.079
Caption: sob however as I was contemplating all

00:42:59.229 --> 00:43:05.108
Caption: of these options that I had in my head

00:43:01.079 --> 00:43:06.940
Caption: he leaned in and he said hey young

00:43:05.108 --> 00:43:11.679
Caption: Michelle Sanford I follow you on

00:43:06.939 --> 00:43:15.969
Caption: LinkedIn I love your articles and I was

00:43:11.679 --> 00:43:18.368
Caption: just so relieved because I didn&#39;t need

00:43:15.969 --> 00:43:20.289
Caption: to prove anything to this guy I didn&#39;t

00:43:18.368 --> 00:43:22.449
Caption: have to say anything impressive he

00:43:20.289 --> 00:43:24.489
Caption: already knew who I was he already knew

00:43:22.449 --> 00:43:27.549
Caption: what I thought I had established

00:43:24.489 --> 00:43:30.129
Caption: credibility from a distance I had been

00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:33.369
Caption: able to access all areas of the business

00:43:30.129 --> 00:43:35.709
Caption: and I was actually influencing by volume

00:43:33.368 --> 00:43:37.989
Caption: because that article had been read by

00:43:35.709 --> 00:43:40.568
Caption: thousands of people just like this guy

00:43:37.989 --> 00:43:43.329
Caption: and so we were able to skip over the

00:43:40.569 --> 00:43:45.130
Caption: awkwardness of that introductory period

00:43:43.329 --> 00:43:49.210
Caption: where we&#39;re both trying to prove who has

00:43:45.129 --> 00:43:51.008
Caption: the biggest deck and go straight to the

00:43:49.209 --> 00:43:53.078
Caption: bit where we&#39;re just you know having a

00:43:51.009 --> 00:43:56.289
Caption: laugh and having a joke and it&#39;s such a

00:43:53.079 --> 00:44:00.009
Caption: good time at that event because of that

00:43:56.289 --> 00:44:03.519
Caption: guy and the realization the social media

00:44:00.009 --> 00:44:07.109
Caption: the tools are the answer for all of us

00:44:03.519 --> 00:44:07.109
Caption: in technology today

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:17.080
