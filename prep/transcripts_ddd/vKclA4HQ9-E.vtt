Caption: Perth conference so I thought why not

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.840
Caption: come in and do a 45 minute talk to start

00:01:24.478 --> 00:01:29.699

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:34.860
Caption: right

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:39.298
Caption: so let&#39;s get started

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.799
Caption: what is design so design is well that&#39;s

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.320
Caption: a really simple question but it&#39;s

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.759
Caption: actually quite hard to answer

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.339
Caption: it&#39;s something everybody&#39;s got

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.079
Caption: experience with in one way or another

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:50.699
Caption: and even if you had a room full of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.979
Caption: designers and you asked them this very

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:55.680
Caption: question you&#39;d get a whole wide range of

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:58.919
Caption: different answers back so it&#39;s no wonder

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.899
Caption: that everybody is confused about design

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:02.819
Caption: so a couple of months ago I was looking

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.700
Caption: around online on the old Facebooks as

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.860
Caption: you do and I saw a Facebook post from an

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:09.899
Caption: online design school that asked this

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.699
Caption: very questioned and I thought great

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.500
Caption: that&#39;s going to be two minutes of my 45

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:15.179
Caption: minute talk I can probably talk through

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.059
Caption: some of the answers that they gave on

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:19.500
Caption: that Facebook post so let&#39;s have a

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.059
Caption: squeeze at some of the things that they

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.039
Caption: are people said in the Facebook post

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:27.919
Caption: comments

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:27.919
Caption: so design is function Made Beautiful

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:34.440
Caption: design is the intentional creation of

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.419
Caption: amazing effortless artifacts

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.419
Caption: all that we see is design

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.340
Caption: is how things work look feel and are

00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:47.098
Caption: used

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:49.738
Caption: so what comes to mind when you think of

00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:51.539
Caption: design so for some people it may mean

00:02:49.738 --> 00:02:55.619
Caption: things like designing things like

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:57.059
Caption: products websites apps Graphics or it

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.639
Caption: might be to say the way that something

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:01.800
Caption: looks or functions and you&#39;d be right

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.018
Caption: these are all things that we refer to as

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.639
Caption: design but there are only a few aspects

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:08.039
Caption: of design

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:10.018
Caption: for about three years ago I was on mat

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:12.238
Caption: leave and I was getting a bit antsy and

00:03:10.018 --> 00:03:14.639
Caption: I wanted to sort of watch a few design

00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:16.500
Caption: presentations and there was one by

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:19.378
Caption: opherion Tov he&#39;s the chief design

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.658
Caption: officer over at ANZ bank and what he

00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:23.580
Caption: talked through was the framework that

00:03:21.658 --> 00:03:26.458
Caption: was developed by the Carnegie Carnegie

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.580
Caption: School of melon School of Design in the

00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:30.539
Caption: 1990s and it talks about four orders of

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.400
Caption: design

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:35.579
Caption: so these aren&#39;t levels there&#39;s no

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:37.439
Caption: hierarchy here but just four types of

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.339
Caption: problem space is that design can help

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.500
Caption: with

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:42.539
Caption: and I found it really useful in the way

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.399
Caption: that it broke this broad concept of

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:46.439
Caption: design into something that was just a

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:48.658
Caption: little bit easier to understand because

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.760
Caption: design at its core is about problem

00:03:48.658 --> 00:03:54.059
Caption: solving

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:56.220
Caption: so these are our four orders of design

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:58.798
Caption: they&#39;re based Loosely around product

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.619
Caption: type and ordered around complexity level

00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:03.539
Caption: now this is all well and good but if you

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:05.339
Caption: actually went up to a designer today and

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:07.199
Caption: said hey what order do you work in

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:09.419
Caption: they&#39;d probably look at you a little bit

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.619
Caption: weird and have no idea what you were

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.720
Caption: talking about

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:15.419
Caption: so it&#39;s not something that designers

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.760
Caption: talk about in their day-to-day but it&#39;s

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:21.019
Caption: a great concept to help explain the

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.019
Caption: broad landscape of design

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.800
Caption: so our first order here is called

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:28.019
Caption: symbols and this is all about visual

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:30.599
Caption: communication and it&#39;s most often the

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:32.698
Caption: area that people associate with design

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.639
Caption: so this is all about the visual things

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:39.119
Caption: people can see so this has things like

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.279
Caption: illustration typography photography

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:43.799
Caption: posters all of that sort of good stuff

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:46.019
Caption: and it&#39;s everything that&#39;s related to

00:04:43.799 --> 00:04:49.638
Caption: the world of graphic design visual

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:49.638
Caption: design and information design

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:54.539
Caption: our second order here is called products

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:56.698
Caption: and this is where objects this includes

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.339
Caption: objects that people physically interact

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.779
Caption: with this is where Form and Function

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:03.059
Caption: meet

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.679
Caption: it&#39;s a world of product design and

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:07.019
Caption: Industrial design

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.880
Caption: and just to confuse things a little bit

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:12.000
Caption: more because everybody&#39;s already

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.820
Caption: confused about design so hey ho physical

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.459
Caption: product design does not equal digital

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.679
Caption: product design so this sits in our next

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:23.339
Caption: order which is

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:25.559
Caption: our order of interactions and this deals

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:26.940
Caption: with the experience of people and things

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:28.799
Caption: over time

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.479
Caption: so it&#39;s often tied in with our first

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:33.119
Caption: order of design and that&#39;s where you see

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:36.360
Caption: our user interface elements appear but

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:37.799
Caption: it delivers on interactions services and

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:39.978
Caption: experiences

00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:43.799
Caption: so this is our world of service design

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:46.759
Caption: user experience design ux design or and

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:46.759
Caption: digital product design

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:52.319
Caption: and now we&#39;re in our fourth order this

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.899
Caption: is called systems and this is our most

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.779
Caption: complex order of all and in this we&#39;re

00:05:54.899 --> 00:06:01.039
Caption: designing for things like businesses

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:03.839
Caption: learning experiences systems cultures

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:06.360
Caption: organizations and even cities

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:08.579
Caption: so this is a this is about how groups of

00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:10.859
Caption: people and things interact with other

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:13.379
Caption: groups of people and things and this is

00:06:10.859 --> 00:06:16.138
Caption: our world of strategic design business

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.119
Caption: design and organizational design

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.919
Caption: now this is all well and good and I

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:23.179
Caption: always love a good framework but let&#39;s

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.179
Caption: have a look at this in action

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.919
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk about Apple okay so

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.800
Caption: um I&#39;ve done this I&#39;ve practiced this

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.779
Caption: talk a few times and I&#39;ve had some

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:36.839
Caption: positive and negative reactions whenever

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:39.239
Caption: I mention Apple to people so can I get a

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:41.819
Caption: hands up for who&#39;s an Apple fan in the

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:44.099
Caption: audience who digs Apple here

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.720
Caption: got a few people thought they might be

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.880
Caption: coming to a design talk

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.419
Caption: um who&#39;s not a fan who&#39;s like Boo his

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.639
Caption: Bad Apple yeah yeah

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:56.339
Caption: and who&#39;s ambivalent who&#39;s like yeah

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.899
Caption: yeah awesome okay we&#39;ve got a good

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:58.559
Caption: mixture in here so this is going to be

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:00.479
Caption: good

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:02.100
Caption: um this isn&#39;t sponsored by Apple by the

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:04.199
Caption: way but if anybody is in the audience

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.360
Caption: like I&#39;m always open to some freebies so

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.679
Caption: that&#39;s good

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:09.239
Caption: so we&#39;re going to go back into our

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:11.579
Caption: orders here we&#39;re going to talk about

00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:14.399
Caption: our first orders order of design which

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:17.819
Caption: is symbols or visual communication

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:19.380
Caption: so in the 1990s Apple was actually in a

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.720
Caption: pretty bad State people actually thought

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.300
Caption: the company was going to go under there

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.598
Caption: was no iPhone there was no iPod there

00:07:24.299 --> 00:07:30.179
Caption: was no iPad no iMac and then while Steve

00:07:27.598 --> 00:07:31.859
Caption: Jobs waited on these products to launch

00:07:30.179 --> 00:07:33.899
Caption: he wanted something that would remind

00:07:31.859 --> 00:07:35.879
Caption: people about the qualities that were

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:37.799
Caption: caught the Apple brand

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.220
Caption: and this is where our think different

00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:43.500
Caption: campaign comes in so here you&#39;ll see one

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.360
Caption: of the print ads that was uh that was

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.098
Caption: created and there were a whole series of

00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:49.079
Caption: print ads that went with this as well as

00:07:47.098 --> 00:07:51.839
Caption: a television commercial

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:53.939
Caption: and it&#39;s really powerful because here

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:56.160
Caption: you can um because of the emotions and

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.619
Caption: memories that this actually conveys so

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.419
Caption: there&#39;s no product shots here there&#39;s no

00:07:58.619 --> 00:08:02.699
Caption: talk of any product benefits there&#39;s

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:05.880
Caption: just three things a historical figure

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:06.959
Caption: the Apple logo and the words think

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.660
Caption: different

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:11.880
Caption: so this is a branding campaign pure and

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:15.500
Caption: simple and it&#39;s one of the most popular

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.500
Caption: Apple campaigns to this day

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.179
Caption: so now we&#39;re looking at our second order

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:23.878
Caption: here and this is our order of products

00:08:21.179 --> 00:08:25.799
Caption: or physical objects so here we&#39;re

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:28.319
Caption: designing two a broader set of

00:08:25.799 --> 00:08:30.359
Caption: challenges which might mean materials

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:33.299
Caption: supply chain Logistics do I need to

00:08:30.359 --> 00:08:36.079
Caption: change my microphone yep

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:36.080
Caption: that&#39;s okay

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.630
Caption: this will take up some of the 45 minutes

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:46.200
Caption: which is good okay cool

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.000
Caption: [Laughter]

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.619
Caption: um right here we are designing to a

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.539
Caption: broader set of challenges so you&#39;re

00:08:49.619 --> 00:08:54.958
Caption: looking at things like materials supply

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:55.979
Caption: chain Logistics ergonomics packaging and

00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:58.018
Caption: more

00:08:55.979 --> 00:08:59.820
Caption: so the Apple packaging itself is a

00:08:58.018 --> 00:09:01.739
Caption: sensory experience your first

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.679
Caption: interaction with this thing is actually

00:09:01.739 --> 00:09:07.140
Caption: how it looks pack this packaging is

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:09.179
Caption: designed to be as visually appealing as

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:12.838
Caption: the thing that sits inside it

00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:14.880
Caption: so every line on this box is clean it&#39;s

00:09:12.838 --> 00:09:17.099
Caption: elegant it&#39;s minimalist it&#39;s white

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.179
Caption: packaging it&#39;s simple in a world of

00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:20.518
Caption: clutter

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:22.619
Caption: so Apple actually pay attention as much

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:25.919
Caption: attention to the small stuff as they do

00:09:22.619 --> 00:09:27.958
Caption: the big stuff so that box that gets the

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:29.579
Caption: same amount of attention as the device

00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.679
Caption: inside it

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.778
Caption: so did you know that there&#39;s actually a

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:37.018
Caption: designer or designers that are employed

00:09:33.778 --> 00:09:40.018
Caption: to create design and test hundreds of

00:09:37.018 --> 00:09:42.539
Caption: prototype boxes so this just isn&#39;t about

00:09:40.018 --> 00:09:44.398
Caption: Aesthetics here it&#39;s also about a

00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:46.919
Caption: package that&#39;s easy for customers to

00:09:44.398 --> 00:09:49.140
Caption: open it&#39;s easy for them to identify the

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:51.719
Caption: components parts inside it and it&#39;s easy

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.398
Caption: for them to start using so it&#39;s a

00:09:51.719 --> 00:09:55.500
Caption: process that&#39;s focused first and

00:09:53.398 --> 00:09:57.479
Caption: foremost on the customer it&#39;s not

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.000
Caption: focused on for example to prevent

00:09:57.479 --> 00:10:02.099
Caption: shoplifting

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.659
Caption: now we&#39;re getting into our third order

00:10:02.099 --> 00:10:05.819
Caption: here and this is our order of

00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:07.379
Caption: interactions and services now I&#39;m going

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.059
Caption: to spend a little bit more time talking

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.739
Caption: about this order because it&#39;s probably

00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:12.659
Caption: where most of your designers will

00:10:10.739 --> 00:10:14.760
Caption: actually be working in

00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:16.979
Caption: so we&#39;re going to think about the

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.679
Caption: experience of buying from an Apple Store

00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:20.760
Caption: from a physical store so you&#39;re going to

00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:22.320
Caption: have a trigger there&#39;s going to be

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.898
Caption: something that makes you want to buy

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.059
Caption: that Apple product maybe it&#39;s an ad that

00:10:24.898 --> 00:10:28.559
Caption: you&#39;ve seen maybe it&#39;s a friend of a

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:30.539
Caption: family member that you&#39;ve been

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:32.700
Caption: recommended it from

00:10:30.539 --> 00:10:34.619
Caption: um you&#39;ll do some research you&#39;ll make

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.000
Caption: your way to the store maybe you&#39;re

00:10:34.619 --> 00:10:37.859
Caption: catching a train

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.898
Caption: you&#39;ll enter the store you&#39;ll talk to

00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:41.760
Caption: somebody about what you&#39;re after you&#39;ll

00:10:39.898 --> 00:10:43.380
Caption: purchase your Apple product you&#39;ll leave

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.338
Caption: the store you&#39;ll go home you&#39;ll open up

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.039
Caption: the box

00:10:44.338 --> 00:10:49.078
Caption: so this whole end to end experience and

00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:51.179
Caption: these touch points and interactions and

00:10:49.078 --> 00:10:52.859
Caption: emotions that are what we&#39;re designing

00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:55.078
Caption: for in this order

00:10:52.859 --> 00:10:57.119
Caption: so in this order our designers look at

00:10:55.078 --> 00:11:00.979
Caption: three main areas we&#39;ve got people

00:10:57.119 --> 00:11:00.979
Caption: process and Technology

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.700
Caption: so first of all the people so it&#39;s not

00:11:04.018 --> 00:11:07.440
Caption: just about the customers but the people

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.838
Caption: that work at Apple

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.700
Caption: this is about maintaining empathy for

00:11:09.838 --> 00:11:14.760
Caption: everybody that&#39;s involved in the process

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.799
Caption: and so by trying to understand all sides

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.278
Caption: we can make human-centered critical

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:22.679
Caption: decisions in designing the experience

00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:24.778
Caption: and we also look at process so these are

00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:27.719
Caption: the standard procedures to operate a

00:11:24.778 --> 00:11:30.000
Caption: business so for this apple example we&#39;ll

00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:32.099
Caption: look at things like how do the staff

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.559
Caption: talk and interact with the customers so

00:11:32.099 --> 00:11:36.299
Caption: what are their selling tactics how are

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:38.039
Caption: the staff rostered on for example what

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:40.140
Caption: happens during peak hours

00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:41.880
Caption: and what are the different roles in the

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.040
Caption: store who does what

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.140
Caption: and by understanding the current process

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:47.820
Caption: and the business requirements we can

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.559
Caption: align and arm people in the business

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.640
Caption: with the knowledge and the tools to help

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:52.640
Caption: improve the experience

00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:56.338
Caption: and the third one we look at is

00:11:54.239 --> 00:11:57.958
Caption: technology so what&#39;s needed to deliver

00:11:56.338 --> 00:12:00.659
Caption: the experience

00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:03.239
Caption: so what technology is Apple using to

00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:04.799
Caption: help deliver the service seamlessly so

00:12:03.239 --> 00:12:07.559
Caption: do they have an efficient point of sale

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:09.778
Caption: system are we tracking deliveries once

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:11.398
Caption: they leave the store or the warehouse we

00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:13.320
Caption: look at technology so we can actually

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:15.359
Caption: understand what are the touch points to

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:19.458
Caption: deliver the service and what can be done

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:19.458
Caption: to deliver a better improved service

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.940
Caption: now we&#39;re getting into our fourth order

00:12:21.778 --> 00:12:25.859
Caption: this is our fourth order of design where

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.000
Caption: we&#39;re reaching into business design and

00:12:25.859 --> 00:12:29.719
Caption: innovation

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.458
Caption: so apple is in fact a service business

00:12:29.719 --> 00:12:34.619
Caption: it&#39;s got everything from the App Store

00:12:32.458 --> 00:12:37.559
Caption: too and I&#39;m going to take a breath here

00:12:34.619 --> 00:12:40.679
Caption: Apple news Apple Books Apple TV Apple

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:42.539
Caption: movies Apple music Apple pay iclouds

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:44.159
Caption: iTunes and much more

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:46.018
Caption: right so this is where it gets its

00:12:44.159 --> 00:12:47.940
Caption: Revenue so it&#39;s not just about selling

00:12:46.018 --> 00:12:50.578
Caption: laptops and phones

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:53.039
Caption: it&#39;s about selling people constant

00:12:50.578 --> 00:12:55.078
Caption: ongoing subscriptions for the things

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:57.599
Caption: that they can do on their devices

00:12:55.078 --> 00:13:00.239
Caption: it&#39;s an ecosystem that&#39;s designed to

00:12:57.599 --> 00:13:02.278
Caption: suck you in and never let you leave so

00:13:00.239 --> 00:13:04.018
Caption: by buying that iPhone it&#39;s almost like

00:13:02.278 --> 00:13:05.940
Caption: that gateway drug into the Apple

00:13:04.018 --> 00:13:08.700
Caption: experience

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:11.760
Caption: so Apple innovate through reinvention

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:14.820
Caption: and they just make it slick so they want

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.100
Caption: to take Innovation to the next level by

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.260
Caption: making its product features better and

00:13:17.099 --> 00:13:21.739
Caption: to work seamlessly across multiple

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.739
Caption: devices

00:13:23.578 --> 00:13:28.559
Caption: so this leads us to now how Apple

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:32.398
Caption: designs their business for innovation

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:34.799
Caption: so in 1997 when jobs returned to Apple

00:13:32.398 --> 00:13:36.239
Caption: this had a conventional structure this

00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:38.578
Caption: is a structure that you see on the left

00:13:36.239 --> 00:13:39.719
Caption: here it was divided into those business

00:13:38.578 --> 00:13:42.119
Caption: units

00:13:39.719 --> 00:13:43.859
Caption: so he changed it to the structure on the

00:13:42.119 --> 00:13:45.719
Caption: right where the organization was

00:13:43.859 --> 00:13:48.719
Caption: restructured to align to areas of

00:13:45.719 --> 00:13:52.138
Caption: expertise and since Tim Cook has taken

00:13:48.719 --> 00:13:54.958
Caption: over it has changed slightly again

00:13:52.138 --> 00:13:56.759
Caption: so they rely on organizational design to

00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:58.739
Caption: have a crucial part in the success for

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.320
Caption: Innovation where they&#39;re able to compete

00:13:58.739 --> 00:14:05.778
Caption: with other companies like Google Samsung

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.778
Caption: Microsoft IBM and many more

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:10.859
Caption: but if you&#39;re anything like me

00:14:08.338 --> 00:14:12.539
Caption: you probably still have questions like

00:14:10.859 --> 00:14:14.940
Caption: when did things start getting so

00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:16.440
Caption: complicated when do we start needing all

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.179
Caption: of these different types of designers

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:21.539
Caption: and when did they start popping up in

00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:24.778
Caption: all of these different organizations

00:14:21.539 --> 00:14:27.419
Caption: so I blame the year 2013 right so I want

00:14:24.778 --> 00:14:29.159
Caption: you to think back to 2013 and think

00:14:27.419 --> 00:14:32.099
Caption: about what you were doing

00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:34.319
Caption: it was almost a decade ago it was a very

00:14:32.099 --> 00:14:37.078
Caption: non-pandemic type of time it was a much

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.600
Caption: simpler time back then but it&#39;s got a

00:14:37.078 --> 00:14:41.159
Caption: lot to answer for now I didn&#39;t know if

00:14:39.599 --> 00:14:42.659
Caption: I&#39;d be losing people at this point so

00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:46.799
Caption: you&#39;ve hit the funny GIF and memes

00:14:42.659 --> 00:14:49.739
Caption: section of my talk which is cool so 2013

00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:51.539
Caption: was when this guy came into office so he

00:14:49.739 --> 00:14:54.958
Caption: was our 28th prime minister like I said

00:14:51.539 --> 00:14:57.119
Caption: 2013 had a lot to answer for thanks to

00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:59.099
Caption: Miley twerking first entered the Oxford

00:14:57.119 --> 00:15:01.138
Caption: dictionary so that&#39;s actually in the

00:14:59.099 --> 00:15:03.000
Caption: dictionary now thanks to her

00:15:01.138 --> 00:15:05.338
Caption: the worst wedding ever happened on Game

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.500
Caption: of Thrones my partner&#39;s now making me

00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:09.239
Caption: re-watch all the Game of Thrones series

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.739
Caption: at the moment so I thought that was

00:15:09.239 --> 00:15:13.619
Caption: quite apt

00:15:10.739 --> 00:15:15.958
Caption: um and back in 2013 I read a wide

00:15:13.619 --> 00:15:18.239
Caption: magazine article which at the time I

00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:20.219
Caption: didn&#39;t think too much of I thought I

00:15:18.239 --> 00:15:21.838
Caption: thought that&#39;s interesting I wonder

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:24.419
Caption: what&#39;s going to happen off of that and

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:27.119
Caption: just sort of moved on with my day

00:15:24.419 --> 00:15:28.859
Caption: but little did I know that that was

00:15:27.119 --> 00:15:31.380
Caption: actually a key moment in terms of what

00:15:28.859 --> 00:15:33.979
Caption: design meant or represented to

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.979
Caption: businesses

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:39.898
Caption: so this is what it was uh entitled it

00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:42.299
Caption: was called Big corporations are buying

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:44.880
Caption: design firms in droves

00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:47.338
Caption: right and the first opening line in this

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:51.479
Caption: was the significance of does in of

00:15:47.338 --> 00:15:55.198
Caption: design in business is ballooning

00:15:51.479 --> 00:15:58.198
Caption: so 2013 is the year that Accenture a

00:15:55.198 --> 00:16:00.838
Caption: global consulting firm buys design giant

00:15:58.198 --> 00:16:03.119
Caption: Fjord so Fjord are a london-based global

00:16:00.838 --> 00:16:05.578
Caption: design and Innovation firm

00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:08.398
Caption: now bigger companies have been acquiring

00:16:05.578 --> 00:16:10.859
Caption: smaller companies since forever but it

00:16:08.398 --> 00:16:13.260
Caption: was about this time that design agencies

00:16:10.859 --> 00:16:15.539
Caption: and firms started to become acquired by

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.880
Caption: large consultant companies and so it

00:16:15.539 --> 00:16:20.940
Caption: wasn&#39;t just large advertising marketing

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:24.359
Caption: and creative groups

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:27.359
Caption: and so fast forward to today so design

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:29.278
Caption: has changed it&#39;s now been recognized by

00:16:27.359 --> 00:16:31.320
Caption: companies and businesses as something

00:16:29.278 --> 00:16:32.880
Caption: that can provide Better Business and

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.859
Caption: customer outcomes

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.599
Caption: and so what this means is now we&#39;re

00:16:34.859 --> 00:16:38.578
Caption: seeing a change in the type of designers

00:16:36.599 --> 00:16:40.500
Caption: that we&#39;re seeing in organizations so

00:16:38.578 --> 00:16:42.778
Caption: say about 10 years ago there were much

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.940
Caption: more visual digital and web designers

00:16:42.778 --> 00:16:49.039
Caption: and now you&#39;re seeing more strategic

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.039
Caption: experience and service designers

00:16:49.979 --> 00:16:54.419
Caption: so what does this mean for you right the

00:16:53.159 --> 00:16:56.518
Caption: projects that you work on and the

00:16:54.419 --> 00:16:58.198
Caption: designers that you actually work with

00:16:56.518 --> 00:17:00.539
Caption: so it not only comes down to

00:16:58.198 --> 00:17:02.578
Caption: understanding what is design all of

00:17:00.539 --> 00:17:03.838
Caption: those cool for for orders that we&#39;ve

00:17:02.578 --> 00:17:06.000
Caption: just gone through

00:17:03.838 --> 00:17:08.400
Caption: but it&#39;s about getting a rough idea of

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.380
Caption: what the design process is like and

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.000
Caption: where different designers can crop up in

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.280
Caption: your process

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.099
Caption: now when we talk through the process

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.900
Caption: today I&#39;ll mainly be talking through our

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:21.119
Caption: third order of design so this is mainly

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:23.578
Caption: when we&#39;re dealing with ux designers

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:26.458
Caption: service designers product designers Etc

00:17:23.578 --> 00:17:28.078
Caption: so this is my area the area that I sit

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:29.880
Caption: in and most of the like I said before

00:17:28.078 --> 00:17:32.640
Caption: where most of your designers will

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.859
Caption: probably sit in

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.539
Caption: so this is what it looks like when

00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:38.579
Caption: you&#39;ve got designers usually explaining

00:17:36.538 --> 00:17:40.500
Caption: design processes we tend to look a

00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:42.599
Caption: little bit like that

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.579
Caption: that does feel like there&#39;s like a

00:17:42.599 --> 00:17:46.798
Caption: million different design Frameworks and

00:17:44.579 --> 00:17:49.319
Caption: methodologies out there out there that

00:17:46.798 --> 00:17:51.119
Caption: step through this process but

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:53.759
Caption: um but the easiest one and the most

00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:56.339
Caption: common one we tend to refer to

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.959
Caption: is our good old Double Diamond and this

00:17:56.339 --> 00:17:59.939
Caption: is great because you can chuck in Double

00:17:57.959 --> 00:18:02.038
Caption: Diamond into Google and this you know is

00:17:59.939 --> 00:18:05.339
Caption: generally what you&#39;ll get back so

00:18:02.038 --> 00:18:08.819
Caption: it was done in 2004 it was created by

00:18:05.339 --> 00:18:10.859
Caption: the UK design Council and it&#39;s very well

00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:12.418
Caption: known with designers so if you ever want

00:18:10.859 --> 00:18:15.000
Caption: to talk to a designer about this they

00:18:12.418 --> 00:18:17.038
Caption: can run you through it so it basically

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.558
Caption: describes our two modes of thinking that

00:18:17.038 --> 00:18:21.719
Caption: we do as designers this is where we&#39;re

00:18:19.558 --> 00:18:24.659
Caption: going wide we&#39;re diverging so you can

00:18:21.719 --> 00:18:27.859
Caption: see I&#39;ll do a clothesline and then we&#39;ll

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.859
Caption: converge and we&#39;ll go narrow

00:18:28.619 --> 00:18:33.058
Caption: might be a new speaker post who knows

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:35.760
Caption: um so the first diamond is really about

00:18:33.058 --> 00:18:37.558
Caption: if we&#39;re figuring out if we&#39;re doing the

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.900
Caption: right things right so this is why we&#39;re

00:18:37.558 --> 00:18:42.899
Caption: going to go wide with our Discovery

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:44.640
Caption: search we&#39;re going to converge and we&#39;re

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.820
Caption: going to go narrow we&#39;re going to Define

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.440
Caption: our research themes our insights and our

00:18:47.819 --> 00:18:51.000
Caption: opportunity areas

00:18:49.439 --> 00:18:53.038
Caption: and then we&#39;re going to go into our

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.558
Caption: second Diamond so this is about building

00:18:53.038 --> 00:18:58.079
Caption: the things right so we go wide we

00:18:55.558 --> 00:18:59.939
Caption: diverge we go wide with our ideas we&#39;re

00:18:58.079 --> 00:19:01.678
Caption: starting to set the design Vision a

00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:03.000
Caption: North star and then we&#39;re going to

00:19:01.678 --> 00:19:04.500
Caption: converge and we&#39;re going to go narrow

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.359
Caption: and this is where we&#39;re prototyping

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.038
Caption: we&#39;re testing we&#39;re learning we&#39;re

00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:12.058
Caption: iterating we&#39;re rinsing and repeating

00:19:08.038 --> 00:19:14.239
Caption: until hazar we have our solution

00:19:12.058 --> 00:19:17.279
Caption: but I have a problem with this approach

00:19:14.239 --> 00:19:19.798
Caption: it&#39;s to design Centric

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.059
Caption: I think it&#39;s useful because it gives all

00:19:19.798 --> 00:19:24.178
Caption: the good stuff that you get with

00:19:21.058 --> 00:19:25.678
Caption: converging and diverging Etc but it

00:19:24.178 --> 00:19:28.140
Caption: suggests that we&#39;ve actually got a final

00:19:25.678 --> 00:19:30.359
Caption: solution at the end that accepts up the

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.640
Caption: expectation that everything&#39;s completed

00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:34.619
Caption: and it&#39;s handed off for implementation

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:37.799
Caption: to our Dev teams

00:19:34.619 --> 00:19:40.859
Caption: that last diamond is way too simplified

00:19:37.798 --> 00:19:44.099
Caption: in the real world of delivery

00:19:40.859 --> 00:19:46.619
Caption: so this is why I personally prefer the

00:19:44.099 --> 00:19:50.038
Caption: triple diamond which was produced by

00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:52.319
Caption: zendesk and this is what it looks like

00:19:50.038 --> 00:19:54.719
Caption: so at the start of our third Diamond

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:56.939
Caption: here we&#39;re confident it&#39;s the right

00:19:54.719 --> 00:19:59.280
Caption: solution at this point we&#39;ve gone

00:19:56.939 --> 00:20:01.739
Caption: through our Discovery process and we

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.140
Caption: know it&#39;s there but it needs further

00:20:01.739 --> 00:20:06.538
Caption: refinement so let&#39;s zoom into this last

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.160
Caption: Diamond a little bit more

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:10.079
Caption: there we go

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.119
Caption: um this diamond actually marks the start

00:20:10.079 --> 00:20:13.678
Caption: of our agile Sprints where we&#39;re

00:20:12.119 --> 00:20:15.719
Caption: building out our products through to our

00:20:13.678 --> 00:20:17.339
Caption: launch and it&#39;s not about doing a

00:20:15.719 --> 00:20:19.619
Caption: handoff

00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:21.239
Caption: here we&#39;re refining and we&#39;re filling in

00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:23.579
Caption: more details as we&#39;re progressing

00:20:21.239 --> 00:20:25.678
Caption: through our Sprints and our Des are

00:20:23.579 --> 00:20:27.659
Caption: investigating Technical Solutions while

00:20:25.678 --> 00:20:30.719
Caption: our designers are creating prototypes

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:33.000
Caption: and conducting usability tests

00:20:30.719 --> 00:20:35.339
Caption: and as we progress we can see the

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.058
Caption: uncertainty is decreasing over time and

00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:41.459
Caption: we&#39;re honing into that right solution

00:20:39.058 --> 00:20:43.020
Caption: and we&#39;re still testing throughout just

00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:44.760
Caption: to see how customers are responding

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:49.219
Caption: through our product so this test and

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.219
Caption: respond and we&#39;re tweaking accordingly

00:20:49.859 --> 00:20:53.520
Caption: and as we progress uncertainty is

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.880
Caption: decreasing over time and we&#39;re starting

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:59.280
Caption: to hone into that right solution

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.660
Caption: now we should be refining our solution

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.820
Caption: as we&#39;re progressing we&#39;re really

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:05.280
Caption: starting to hone in but towards the end

00:21:02.819 --> 00:21:07.139
Caption: that flexibility for change decreases

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.940
Caption: and at the end it&#39;s that last little

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.799
Caption: bits of optimizations that we&#39;re

00:21:08.939 --> 00:21:12.418
Caption: actually accounting for

00:21:10.798 --> 00:21:14.038
Caption: now it&#39;s important to remember and

00:21:12.418 --> 00:21:17.159
Caption: anyone that&#39;s been involved in this

00:21:14.038 --> 00:21:19.319
Caption: process it&#39;s never linear it feels a

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.880
Caption: little bit messy sometimes sometimes

00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:23.038
Caption: there&#39;s features that you may discover

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.959
Caption: that need to go back into the discovery

00:21:23.038 --> 00:21:27.418
Caption: process for example

00:21:24.959 --> 00:21:29.459
Caption: so now we&#39;ve got a good understanding of

00:21:27.418 --> 00:21:31.319
Caption: the process let&#39;s talk about some of the

00:21:29.459 --> 00:21:34.798
Caption: different designers you&#39;ll get across

00:21:31.319 --> 00:21:36.000
Caption: this process and where do they sit

00:21:34.798 --> 00:21:36.959
Caption: I&#39;m going to take a bit of water here

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.678
Caption: just

00:21:36.959 --> 00:21:39.678
Caption: hold on

00:21:39.959 --> 00:21:45.599
Caption: right so now we&#39;re back into our Triple

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:48.419
Caption: Diamond the full triple diamond and here

00:21:45.599 --> 00:21:50.339
Caption: it&#39;s an example of what our hbf projects

00:21:48.418 --> 00:21:52.859
Caption: look like and how our designers sit in

00:21:50.339 --> 00:21:54.839
Caption: the process so we&#39;re actually in that

00:21:52.859 --> 00:21:55.678
Caption: last little validation stage at the

00:21:54.839 --> 00:21:58.079
Caption: moment

00:21:55.678 --> 00:21:59.760
Caption: so our service designers and our ux

00:21:58.079 --> 00:22:02.339
Caption: researchers are performing heuristic

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.859
Caption: reviews and assessments with some squads

00:22:02.339 --> 00:22:08.099
Caption: and our in-squad product designers are

00:22:04.859 --> 00:22:09.359
Caption: ux uis are working through bug fixes and

00:22:08.099 --> 00:22:12.000
Caption: improvements

00:22:09.359 --> 00:22:14.400
Caption: so as a team we&#39;re actually honing in on

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.219
Caption: our final solution but our flexibility

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:20.839
Caption: for changes definitely decreasing as

00:22:17.219 --> 00:22:20.839
Caption: we&#39;re getting closer to our rollout

00:22:21.659 --> 00:22:27.059
Caption: so let&#39;s talk about collaborating with

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.918
Caption: designers in this process so it&#39;s really

00:22:27.058 --> 00:22:31.380
Caption: important to remember that designers

00:22:28.918 --> 00:22:33.959
Caption: don&#39;t hold the Monopoly over how we

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:35.039
Caption: design and build products or even how we

00:22:33.959 --> 00:22:37.199
Caption: innovate

00:22:35.038 --> 00:22:39.418
Caption: remember we need to collaborate with our

00:22:37.199 --> 00:22:42.798
Caption: experts with you guys and ladies and

00:22:39.418 --> 00:22:42.798
Caption: gents and everyone in this room

00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:47.640
Caption: so the reason why we need you

00:22:45.298 --> 00:22:49.019
Caption: we need to make sure that we&#39;re design

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.780
Caption: what we&#39;re designing is not only

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:55.140
Caption: desirable but it&#39;s also feasible to

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:57.479
Caption: create and viable for the business

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.820
Caption: so if there&#39;s no collaboration there we

00:22:57.479 --> 00:23:02.158
Caption: end up missing two key areas our

00:22:59.819 --> 00:23:04.558
Caption: feasibility and our viability

00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:07.320
Caption: so Innovation and great products can&#39;t

00:23:04.558 --> 00:23:09.418
Caption: happen in isolation and it&#39;s certainly

00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:11.880
Caption: not about throwing things over the fence

00:23:09.418 --> 00:23:15.119
Caption: and designing and developing without

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:16.859
Caption: collaboration so collaboration is key to

00:23:15.119 --> 00:23:18.119
Caption: creating Innovative products and

00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:20.280
Caption: services

00:23:18.119 --> 00:23:23.339
Caption: uh so for those that are interested this

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.260
Caption: is what we call a dvf framework

00:23:23.339 --> 00:23:27.779
Caption: um it also is referred to as three

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:30.298
Caption: lenses of innovation and it was done by

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.679
Caption: originally a company called Ideo and

00:23:30.298 --> 00:23:33.719
Caption: there&#39;s been a lot of talk recently

00:23:31.678 --> 00:23:35.819
Caption: about a fourth lens uh this is for

00:23:33.719 --> 00:23:37.619
Caption: sustainability and this is where we&#39;re

00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:39.538
Caption: looking at including social and

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:41.939
Caption: environmental awarenesses into our

00:23:39.538 --> 00:23:44.879
Caption: designs as well

00:23:41.939 --> 00:23:46.199
Caption: right let&#39;s go through some practical

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.900
Caption: tips because I&#39;m all about practical

00:23:46.199 --> 00:23:51.658
Caption: tips that can help improve collaboration

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:55.140
Caption: with your designers

00:23:51.659 --> 00:23:57.659
Caption: so first see your design team as your

00:23:55.140 --> 00:24:00.119
Caption: true partner in crime so we can help you

00:23:57.659 --> 00:24:02.340
Caption: understand customer needs and can help

00:24:00.119 --> 00:24:04.579
Caption: you influence the product design and

00:24:02.339 --> 00:24:08.038
Caption: direction

00:24:04.579 --> 00:24:10.380
Caption: and provide constructive feedback so we

00:24:08.038 --> 00:24:12.479
Caption: love getting good useful

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.339
Caption: um feedback and fresh ideas but it needs

00:24:12.479 --> 00:24:16.500
Caption: to be delivered in a way which is

00:24:14.339 --> 00:24:19.140
Caption: actually useful so things like I love it

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:21.119
Caption: is always great but making sure you tell

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:23.880
Caption: us why you love it the same thing goes

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:25.319
Caption: with uh I don&#39;t like it to make sure

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.298
Caption: that you&#39;ve got um that backing there

00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:29.519
Caption: for why you don&#39;t like it

00:24:27.298 --> 00:24:31.798
Caption: so providing a reasonable always help

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:35.099
Caption: your designers but you need to make sure

00:24:31.798 --> 00:24:36.719
Caption: it&#39;s with the lens of your customer make

00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:38.520
Caption: sure it&#39;s objective feedback and if

00:24:36.719 --> 00:24:41.418
Caption: you&#39;ve got the data there to support it

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.419
Caption: even better

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:47.219
Caption: so be upfront about constraints so your

00:24:45.239 --> 00:24:49.199
Caption: designers should be getting feedback

00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:51.839
Caption: from you throughout the design process

00:24:49.199 --> 00:24:53.359
Caption: and if they&#39;re not definitely hit them

00:24:51.839 --> 00:24:56.219
Caption: up about that

00:24:53.359 --> 00:24:58.199
Caption: speak up about Technical and business

00:24:56.219 --> 00:25:01.199
Caption: constraints as well so when we know

00:24:58.199 --> 00:25:03.538
Caption: about these it helps us work with you to

00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:05.939
Caption: find an alternative solution

00:25:03.538 --> 00:25:07.739
Caption: but it&#39;s really important to be

00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:09.899
Caption: considerate and to make sure that

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:13.020
Caption: upfront constraints don&#39;t stifle

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:15.359
Caption: creativity and Innovation so make sure

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:19.039
Caption: you work with your designers as a team

00:25:15.359 --> 00:25:19.038
Caption: to overcome those constraints

00:25:19.678 --> 00:25:25.880
Caption: review design work thoroughly so this is

00:25:23.219 --> 00:25:29.520
Caption: especially true for our visual designers

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.959
Caption: so Details Matter here right they may

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.119
Caption: your designers may think that the

00:25:30.959 --> 00:25:35.579
Caption: Specter everything but more than likely

00:25:33.119 --> 00:25:37.798
Caption: they have actually missed something

00:25:35.579 --> 00:25:40.079
Caption: so the same thing goes for those that

00:25:37.798 --> 00:25:42.418
Caption: are working with Design Systems

00:25:40.079 --> 00:25:45.298
Caption: so make sure you&#39;re factoring it in time

00:25:42.418 --> 00:25:46.918
Caption: with your feedback quite often we work

00:25:45.298 --> 00:25:48.778
Caption: hand to mouth especially when we&#39;re

00:25:46.918 --> 00:25:51.479
Caption: working in squads right where all the

00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:53.640
Caption: deliverables are really urgent but this

00:25:51.479 --> 00:25:55.739
Caption: actually leads to problems later on so

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.079
Caption: when suddenly it just becomes a just get

00:25:55.739 --> 00:26:00.298
Caption: it done sort of scenario we may miss

00:25:58.079 --> 00:26:02.519
Caption: opportunities for things that need to be

00:26:00.298 --> 00:26:04.678
Caption: tested

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.239
Caption: now out of all of these points if

00:26:04.678 --> 00:26:08.519
Caption: there&#39;s any one point that&#39;s probably

00:26:06.239 --> 00:26:12.000
Caption: the most important this is it this is

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:13.919
Caption: about getting involved so observe your

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.839
Caption: research sessions make the time to

00:26:13.918 --> 00:26:18.298
Caption: observe them listen to the customer

00:26:15.839 --> 00:26:19.558
Caption: feedback and even your debriefs from

00:26:18.298 --> 00:26:21.719
Caption: your designers

00:26:19.558 --> 00:26:24.418
Caption: so discuss with them what are their next

00:26:21.719 --> 00:26:26.579
Caption: steps highlight any technical or

00:26:24.418 --> 00:26:30.259
Caption: business constraints and but leave it

00:26:26.579 --> 00:26:30.260
Caption: with them to make the design decisions

00:26:30.479 --> 00:26:34.979
Caption: right so I actually know I&#39;ve got a few

00:26:32.939 --> 00:26:36.298
Caption: designers in the audience today so I

00:26:34.979 --> 00:26:37.859
Caption: don&#39;t think I haven&#39;t forgotten about

00:26:36.298 --> 00:26:39.239
Caption: you

00:26:37.859 --> 00:26:40.918
Caption: and hopefully some are watching online

00:26:39.239 --> 00:26:43.678
Caption: as well

00:26:40.918 --> 00:26:45.658
Caption: now just think

00:26:43.678 --> 00:26:47.399
Caption: what if you gave the same care and

00:26:45.659 --> 00:26:50.520
Caption: attention to the people that you work

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:52.500
Caption: with as you do your end users right so

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.020
Caption: find out the pain points and needs for

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.880
Caption: the people that you work with so talk to

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:59.880
Caption: them take them out for coffee maybe beer

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.558
Caption: or wine always open for that maybe some

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.579
Caption: people like something a little bit more

00:27:01.558 --> 00:27:04.739
Caption: formal

00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:06.479
Caption: I&#39;ve even seen designers use empathy

00:27:04.739 --> 00:27:07.798
Caption: Maps before to better understand their

00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:10.199
Caption: teammates

00:27:07.798 --> 00:27:12.418
Caption: so understand maybe the pressures that

00:27:10.199 --> 00:27:14.339
Caption: your product owner is under so what

00:27:12.418 --> 00:27:15.839
Caption: metrics are important to them what are

00:27:14.339 --> 00:27:17.699
Caption: they trying to achieve

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:19.859
Caption: what are the pain points for your

00:27:17.699 --> 00:27:21.839
Caption: developers is rework a problem for them

00:27:19.859 --> 00:27:22.859
Caption: what&#39;s going to make their life a lot

00:27:21.839 --> 00:27:24.778
Caption: easier

00:27:22.859 --> 00:27:27.119
Caption: so by understanding the people that you

00:27:24.779 --> 00:27:29.340
Caption: work with just as well as you do your

00:27:27.119 --> 00:27:31.500
Caption: users you can actually establish better

00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:34.079
Caption: workflows that will provide better

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:37.260
Caption: outcomes and will end up having a better

00:27:34.079 --> 00:27:39.479
Caption: happier working relationships

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:42.779
Caption: so be like Bruce Lee this is very Zen be

00:27:39.479 --> 00:27:45.298
Caption: like Bruce Lee be flexible like water

00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:47.640
Caption: so your design documentation some

00:27:45.298 --> 00:27:50.339
Caption: workflows will change from Project to

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.678
Caption: project from Team to team and you need

00:27:50.339 --> 00:27:53.699
Caption: to adapt to what what works best for

00:27:52.678 --> 00:27:56.880
Caption: your team

00:27:53.699 --> 00:27:58.139
Caption: so your team shouldn&#39;t adapt to you I

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.239
Caption: mean sure sometimes you may have

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.678
Caption: suggestions to actually uh how a

00:28:00.239 --> 00:28:04.439
Caption: different approach may help everything

00:28:01.678 --> 00:28:09.140
Caption: but in general we&#39;re a piece of a larger

00:28:04.439 --> 00:28:09.139
Caption: puzzle so be like water be adaptable

00:28:09.418 --> 00:28:13.798
Caption: your desire will never be done sounds a

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.119
Caption: little bit depressing but this is where

00:28:13.798 --> 00:28:18.959
Caption: you need to be strong this is where

00:28:15.119 --> 00:28:21.119
Caption: resilience is key so as a designer our

00:28:18.959 --> 00:28:23.038
Caption: job isn&#39;t done once our screens and

00:28:21.119 --> 00:28:25.020
Caption: prototypes are dumb you&#39;re going to find

00:28:23.038 --> 00:28:26.879
Caption: that the real Challenge and I&#39;m finding

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.380
Caption: this at the moment is when people start

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.199
Caption: poking around in your designs

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.940
Caption: discovering holes and use cases that you

00:28:31.199 --> 00:28:35.939
Caption: haven&#39;t even thought of

00:28:32.939 --> 00:28:38.038
Caption: and so as this happens you need to make

00:28:35.939 --> 00:28:40.379
Caption: sure that you work harder to accommodate

00:28:38.038 --> 00:28:41.459
Caption: these requirements iterating on your

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.979
Caption: designs

00:28:41.459 --> 00:28:46.619
Caption: so our role this is because our role as

00:28:43.979 --> 00:28:49.140
Caption: designers is to create experiences that

00:28:46.619 --> 00:28:51.719
Caption: people actually use it&#39;s not about

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.940
Caption: creating mock-ups or concepts

00:28:51.719 --> 00:28:56.339
Caption: so we need to be responsible for the

00:28:53.939 --> 00:28:58.678
Caption: things we create we&#39;re an important part

00:28:56.339 --> 00:29:01.319
Caption: of what is produced and used by the

00:28:58.678 --> 00:29:02.880
Caption: people that we champion

00:29:01.319 --> 00:29:05.219
Caption: because of this we&#39;re going to

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.678
Caption: continually keep iterating and improving

00:29:05.219 --> 00:29:09.599
Caption: and evolving our designs and they&#39;ll

00:29:07.678 --> 00:29:12.918
Caption: never be done but at the end of the day

00:29:09.599 --> 00:29:12.918
Caption: that&#39;s a great thing

00:29:13.798 --> 00:29:19.619
Caption: so it&#39;s not just about design either so

00:29:17.159 --> 00:29:22.140
Caption: how can designers help make sure that we

00:29:19.619 --> 00:29:23.699
Caption: deliver on a great product so this is

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.739
Caption: where we&#39;re going to get our hands dirty

00:29:23.699 --> 00:29:27.538
Caption: and we&#39;re going to help provide feedback

00:29:25.739 --> 00:29:30.359
Caption: on what&#39;s being built

00:29:27.538 --> 00:29:32.278
Caption: so for example the designers in our web

00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:34.500
Caption: Squad at the moment over at HBS have

00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:35.880
Caption: been doing device testing and I&#39;ve had a

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.199
Caption: heap of people come up to me going but

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.760
Caption: why are you guys doing testing like

00:29:37.199 --> 00:29:40.558
Caption: doesn&#39;t that sit with the developers and

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.178
Caption: the testers

00:29:40.558 --> 00:29:44.880
Caption: um but designers actually have an

00:29:42.178 --> 00:29:47.099
Caption: intimate knowledge of the product of the

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.839
Caption: end user and what should be built right

00:29:47.099 --> 00:29:50.398
Caption: and they know how those dots connect

00:29:48.839 --> 00:29:53.819
Caption: throughout that whole end-to-end

00:29:50.399 --> 00:29:55.860
Caption: experience so use that to your advantage

00:29:53.819 --> 00:29:57.839
Caption: so designers this means you might have

00:29:55.859 --> 00:30:00.298
Caption: to get intimate with things like for

00:29:57.839 --> 00:30:02.880
Caption: example jira make sure the acceptance

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:04.619
Caption: criteria is correct make sure that that

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.479
Caption: link in that ticket is linking through

00:30:04.619 --> 00:30:09.000
Caption: to your figma file or your sketch file

00:30:06.479 --> 00:30:11.880
Caption: make sure those screenshots are correct

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.678
Caption: so all of these things work to help your

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.719
Caption: team and also help make sure that you

00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:18.199
Caption: deliver on a great product and

00:30:15.719 --> 00:30:18.199
Caption: experience

00:30:18.418 --> 00:30:23.819
Caption: so less is more

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:26.579
Caption: so as we desire as designers we design

00:30:23.819 --> 00:30:29.759
Caption: for an ideal state right our future

00:30:26.579 --> 00:30:32.339
Caption: state so in the real world not all of

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.199
Caption: our features will make it into our MVP

00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:35.339
Caption: our minimal viable product that&#39;s built

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:37.918
Caption: at the end

00:30:35.339 --> 00:30:40.199
Caption: so as the project progresses you&#39;re

00:30:37.918 --> 00:30:42.959
Caption: going to find that your product owner is

00:30:40.199 --> 00:30:45.119
Caption: going to prioritize features and as this

00:30:42.959 --> 00:30:48.058
Caption: happens designers are going to see their

00:30:45.119 --> 00:30:49.558
Caption: work shrink and shrink and shrink and

00:30:48.058 --> 00:30:51.359
Caption: Shrink until everything&#39;s sort of thrown

00:30:49.558 --> 00:30:53.939
Caption: over at the end of the day at the end of

00:30:51.359 --> 00:30:56.760
Caption: the boat so this is where a design

00:30:53.939 --> 00:30:59.038
Caption: mindset change is needed so this should

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:02.279
Caption: be seen as an opportunity rather than an

00:30:59.038 --> 00:31:04.859
Caption: attack so we can really work to refine

00:31:02.279 --> 00:31:06.840
Caption: out these MVP features and really make

00:31:04.859 --> 00:31:10.339
Caption: sure that we&#39;re working closely with our

00:31:06.839 --> 00:31:10.339
Caption: teams to build this out

00:31:11.359 --> 00:31:17.158
Caption: now just like the last a lot of points

00:31:15.119 --> 00:31:18.719
Caption: that I went through if there&#39;s any one

00:31:17.159 --> 00:31:20.220
Caption: that you want to take away with you this

00:31:18.719 --> 00:31:23.418
Caption: is probably it it&#39;s about bringing our

00:31:20.219 --> 00:31:23.418
Caption: teams along for the ride

00:31:23.939 --> 00:31:27.119
Caption: and see there&#39;s a roller coaster there

00:31:25.619 --> 00:31:29.158
Caption: haha

00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:31.099
Caption: um so sometimes our teams aren&#39;t

00:31:29.159 --> 00:31:33.059
Caption: involved in our Discovery process

00:31:31.099 --> 00:31:35.398
Caption: sometimes they don&#39;t get to see things

00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:37.260
Caption: like usability tests or hear from our

00:31:35.399 --> 00:31:39.779
Caption: end users right

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:42.119
Caption: so as designers we represent the voice

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:43.980
Caption: of the customer we&#39;ve got a really

00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:46.500
Caption: important part in making sure that

00:31:43.979 --> 00:31:49.260
Caption: goodness spreads across our teams

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.298
Caption: so it might be things like playing back

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:54.058
Caption: verbatim feedback that we&#39;ve had in our

00:31:51.298 --> 00:31:56.278
Caption: user testing sessions we may present

00:31:54.058 --> 00:31:58.678
Caption: test results back in some things like uh

00:31:56.279 --> 00:32:00.779
Caption: we&#39;ve got showcases for example at hbf

00:31:58.678 --> 00:32:03.359
Caption: we play back our research findings and

00:32:00.779 --> 00:32:05.279
Caption: those and if you&#39;re able to play back

00:32:03.359 --> 00:32:07.678
Caption: videos where people can hear it from the

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:09.840
Caption: horse&#39;s mouth that&#39;s even better

00:32:07.678 --> 00:32:12.298
Caption: so where you can make sure you involve

00:32:09.839 --> 00:32:14.339
Caption: your teams so it&#39;s really difficult

00:32:12.298 --> 00:32:17.038
Caption: sometimes because there is a tension

00:32:14.339 --> 00:32:19.260
Caption: between just getting the stuff done

00:32:17.038 --> 00:32:21.178
Caption: making sure we&#39;re achieving our Sprint

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.159
Caption: goals making sure we&#39;re getting that

00:32:21.178 --> 00:32:25.558
Caption: burn down looking really good

00:32:23.159 --> 00:32:27.779
Caption: but in the bigger picture we&#39;re going to

00:32:25.558 --> 00:32:29.939
Caption: have products that provide a better

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:31.919
Caption: experiences for our teams if they know

00:32:29.939 --> 00:32:33.959
Caption: who they&#39;re designing them for and who

00:32:31.918 --> 00:32:36.658
Caption: they&#39;re building them for as well

00:32:33.959 --> 00:32:38.819
Caption: so as designers it&#39;s not just about us

00:32:36.659 --> 00:32:40.380
Caption: understanding our end users it&#39;s also

00:32:38.819 --> 00:32:43.199
Caption: the role of the business to understand

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:45.178
Caption: the end users and as designers we need

00:32:43.199 --> 00:32:46.439
Caption: to make sure we&#39;re better at spreading

00:32:45.178 --> 00:32:49.819
Caption: and sharing that knowledge and

00:32:46.439 --> 00:32:49.819
Caption: understanding of our customers

00:32:51.178 --> 00:32:55.199
Caption: so these tactics that I&#39;ve talked

00:32:53.579 --> 00:32:57.298
Caption: through are really aimed at improving

00:32:55.199 --> 00:32:59.099
Caption: collaboration right so we know that

00:32:57.298 --> 00:33:02.158
Caption: collaboration is really key for high

00:32:59.099 --> 00:33:03.599
Caption: performing cross-functional teams but it

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:06.419
Caption: also improves something that we call

00:33:03.599 --> 00:33:09.000
Caption: Design maturity so what is design

00:33:06.418 --> 00:33:12.178
Caption: maturity

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.219
Caption: so design maturity is the way to which

00:33:12.178 --> 00:33:17.339
Caption: business businesses incorporate

00:33:14.219 --> 00:33:20.518
Caption: understand and use design

00:33:17.339 --> 00:33:22.739
Caption: so the more mature an organization the

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:24.720
Caption: more likely that Innovation better

00:33:22.739 --> 00:33:27.239
Caption: customer experiences and business

00:33:24.719 --> 00:33:29.158
Caption: benefits will happen

00:33:27.239 --> 00:33:30.538
Caption: so there&#39;s been a bunch of reports and

00:33:29.159 --> 00:33:32.460
Caption: models that have been done on design

00:33:30.538 --> 00:33:34.439
Caption: maturity there&#39;s been one through the

00:33:32.459 --> 00:33:36.839
Caption: Nielsen Norman group that&#39;s very ux

00:33:34.439 --> 00:33:38.939
Caption: focused there was one three years ago

00:33:36.839 --> 00:33:41.038
Caption: through a company called Envision and

00:33:38.939 --> 00:33:42.298
Caption: one done about five years ago through

00:33:41.038 --> 00:33:43.918
Caption: McKinsey

00:33:42.298 --> 00:33:47.839
Caption: so we&#39;re going to have a quick look at

00:33:43.918 --> 00:33:47.839
Caption: the Envision maturity scale here

00:33:48.178 --> 00:33:53.640
Caption: so this is the maturity scale that was

00:33:50.519 --> 00:33:55.440
Caption: done by Envision so here you can see as

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.178
Caption: we move through different levels of

00:33:55.439 --> 00:33:59.518
Caption: design maturity so they&#39;re those big

00:33:57.178 --> 00:34:02.339
Caption: dots you see on the screen there the

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:04.679
Caption: benefits of design and the adoption of

00:34:02.339 --> 00:34:06.719
Caption: design in the business increase

00:34:04.678 --> 00:34:08.699
Caption: so these circles represent the

00:34:06.719 --> 00:34:11.520
Caption: proportions of businesses for each of

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:13.739
Caption: these maturity stages in the study so

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.560
Caption: for example that little dot that you see

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:18.780
Caption: at the top right there that shows that

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.879
Caption: five percent of comp companies were at

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.280
Caption: the top level of design maturity so in

00:34:20.878 --> 00:34:26.579
Caption: this study that&#39;s 110 businesses out of

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:29.099
Caption: 2 200.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:31.739
Caption: so let&#39;s look at each of these levels

00:34:29.099 --> 00:34:33.720
Caption: let&#39;s go into our level ones so these

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:35.339
Caption: had the lowest level of design maturity

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:37.459
Caption: but they actually make up the largest

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:39.720
Caption: proportion at 41

00:34:37.459 --> 00:34:42.658
Caption: so these are the companies where design

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:44.098
Caption: is just seen as pixels on a screen

00:34:42.658 --> 00:34:47.219
Caption: so here there&#39;s a real disconnect

00:34:44.099 --> 00:34:49.740
Caption: between what designers design and what

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:53.598
Caption: developers actually produce and so this

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:53.598
Caption: is a symptom of a lack of collaboration

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:59.580
Caption: when we hit our level two so this is a

00:34:56.699 --> 00:35:01.079
Caption: level twos we&#39;re at 21 here this is

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:03.060
Caption: where collaboration with these

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.859
Caption: organizations was improving where

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.900
Caption: designers and non-designers are starting

00:35:04.858 --> 00:35:09.299
Caption: to work together a lot more

00:35:06.899 --> 00:35:12.118
Caption: so here you&#39;re seeing uh more things

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:14.280
Caption: like integrated tooling user research

00:35:12.118 --> 00:35:16.039
Caption: user testing you&#39;re probably seeing some

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.179
Caption: personas around the business

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:21.859
Caption: and you&#39;re generally hearing a lot more

00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:21.858
Caption: chit chat about design in the business

00:35:22.919 --> 00:35:28.679
Caption: now we&#39;re going to look at our level

00:35:25.139 --> 00:35:30.419
Caption: threes here they&#39;re at 21 as well but

00:35:28.679 --> 00:35:32.219
Caption: this is where design starts to become

00:35:30.419 --> 00:35:34.020
Caption: scalable where there&#39;s established

00:35:32.219 --> 00:35:36.540
Caption: things like processes roles

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:38.520
Caption: responsibilities documentation all of

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:40.560
Caption: that sort of stuff so this is where

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.439
Caption: design operates in more complex

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:46.079
Caption: companies and product ecosystems

00:35:43.439 --> 00:35:48.479
Caption: so with level threes you&#39;re seeing more

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:49.739
Caption: things like Design Systems written

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:53.358
Caption: briefs

00:35:49.739 --> 00:35:53.358
Caption: um and More Design ceremonies

00:35:53.939 --> 00:35:57.060
Caption: when we look at our level fours so this

00:35:55.858 --> 00:35:59.338
Caption: is where we&#39;re starting to get a little

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.959
Caption: bit smaller here this is a 12 of

00:35:59.339 --> 00:36:02.160
Caption: companies in this survey that um

00:36:00.959 --> 00:36:03.419
Caption: envisioned them

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:05.939
Caption: so this is where you&#39;re starting to see

00:36:03.419 --> 00:36:08.578
Caption: a lot more design experimentation and

00:36:05.939 --> 00:36:09.959
Caption: it&#39;s all about data driven design

00:36:08.579 --> 00:36:12.060
Caption: so this is where you&#39;re probably

00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:14.338
Caption: starting to see the starts of a design

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.599
Caption: strategy practice this is where you&#39;re

00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:18.239
Caption: probably going to see more market

00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:20.339
Caption: research and design Vision development

00:36:18.239 --> 00:36:22.500
Caption: and happening and you&#39;re probably seeing

00:36:20.339 --> 00:36:25.380
Caption: design operations being formalized to

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:27.479
Caption: support the design practice as well

00:36:25.379 --> 00:36:29.338
Caption: and our last Little Dot at the top there

00:36:27.479 --> 00:36:31.560
Caption: that&#39;s our level five so this is nirvana

00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:34.500
Caption: right so this is level five it sounded

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:36.479
Caption: really Australian Nirvana anyway

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.399
Caption: um this is our ultimate level of design

00:36:36.479 --> 00:36:40.079
Caption: maturity right this is only where five

00:36:38.399 --> 00:36:42.838
Caption: percent of the companies in the survey

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:44.760
Caption: were playing so this is where design is

00:36:42.839 --> 00:36:46.980
Caption: actually used to help business strategy

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:49.079
Caption: where we&#39;re doing exploratory user

00:36:46.979 --> 00:36:51.419
Caption: research we&#39;re doing Trend spotting and

00:36:49.079 --> 00:36:53.880
Caption: Futures research we&#39;re experimenting

00:36:51.419 --> 00:36:57.439
Caption: we&#39;re testing for product Market fit and

00:36:53.879 --> 00:36:59.879
Caption: producing things like Vision artifacts

00:36:57.439 --> 00:37:01.618
Caption: so the majority of places that I&#39;ve

00:36:59.879 --> 00:37:03.479
Caption: worked at I&#39;d say would be between a

00:37:01.618 --> 00:37:05.519
Caption: level one and three so that&#39;s not a bad

00:37:03.479 --> 00:37:08.098
Caption: thing it just means design as a function

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.359
Caption: in the business is in its early days

00:37:08.099 --> 00:37:11.160
Caption: and so it&#39;s really important to remember

00:37:09.358 --> 00:37:13.819
Caption: you can&#39;t just jump from a level one to

00:37:11.159 --> 00:37:16.500
Caption: a level five if only if it was that easy

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.599
Caption: it&#39;s a real gradual progression that

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.820
Caption: requires a huge amount of effort and a

00:37:18.599 --> 00:37:24.240
Caption: lot of the the business are buying from

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:26.900
Caption: uh the business as well so it can take

00:37:24.239 --> 00:37:29.939
Caption: years to move from one stage to the next

00:37:26.899 --> 00:37:32.459
Caption: but it happens every day in still in

00:37:29.939 --> 00:37:34.260
Caption: small steps I do seem to remember off

00:37:32.459 --> 00:37:36.239
Caption: the top of my head but don&#39;t quote me I

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.099
Caption: think it takes probably about 30 years

00:37:36.239 --> 00:37:40.679
Caption: possibly to reach a level five

00:37:38.099 --> 00:37:43.680
Caption: organization

00:37:40.679 --> 00:37:45.838
Caption: so aside from collaboration what can

00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:48.719
Caption: help right so here are some tips from

00:37:45.839 --> 00:37:52.339
Caption: that report and some examples of what

00:37:48.719 --> 00:37:52.338
Caption: we&#39;ve been doing over at hbf

00:37:52.618 --> 00:37:57.059
Caption: so design needs to be supported at a

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.159
Caption: leadership level so when it&#39;s seen as

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:00.839
Caption: more than just pixels on a screen and

00:37:59.159 --> 00:38:02.459
Caption: it&#39;s recognized it&#39;s a part of the

00:38:00.839 --> 00:38:05.099
Caption: business a critical part of the business

00:38:02.459 --> 00:38:06.179
Caption: there&#39;s opportunity to use design to

00:38:05.099 --> 00:38:08.579
Caption: innovate

00:38:06.179 --> 00:38:10.319
Caption: so it&#39;s something that we do have at hbf

00:38:08.579 --> 00:38:11.880
Caption: so we&#39;ve got support from our general

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:14.099
Caption: managers in the business and we&#39;ve got

00:38:11.879 --> 00:38:15.239
Caption: an executive general manager of member

00:38:14.099 --> 00:38:17.760
Caption: experience

00:38:15.239 --> 00:38:20.280
Caption: so they actually understand and speak to

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.439
Caption: the value of design and so having this

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.839
Caption: support actually means that hpf has

00:38:22.439 --> 00:38:26.639
Caption: actually adopted design and see it as

00:38:24.839 --> 00:38:29.720
Caption: key for improving the customer and

00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:29.719
Caption: member experiences

00:38:30.179 --> 00:38:34.139
Caption: so higher experience design leaders

00:38:32.399 --> 00:38:36.179
Caption: right isn&#39;t this typically what you

00:38:34.139 --> 00:38:38.959
Caption: think of a designer you know wearing

00:38:36.179 --> 00:38:42.059
Caption: black glasses and a black outfit

00:38:38.959 --> 00:38:43.679
Caption: the more senior a design leadership the

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:46.560
Caption: greater the return on the design

00:38:43.679 --> 00:38:48.959
Caption: investment so who should you be hiring

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.000
Caption: for right so you need design leaders

00:38:48.959 --> 00:38:53.219
Caption: that know their craft they can Inspire

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.399
Caption: their team and they can make a strong

00:38:53.219 --> 00:38:57.598
Caption: case for design at the highest levels of

00:38:56.399 --> 00:39:00.239
Caption: business

00:38:57.599 --> 00:39:01.680
Caption: so at hbf we&#39;ve got a chapter lead and

00:39:00.239 --> 00:39:03.598
Caption: we&#39;ve also got a gem of member

00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:05.520
Caption: experience strategy and they&#39;re part of

00:39:03.599 --> 00:39:07.320
Caption: those critical conversations and this

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.119
Caption: actually gives design a voice in the

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:12.440
Caption: business where it can actually be used

00:39:09.118 --> 00:39:12.439
Caption: to transform the business

00:39:12.719 --> 00:39:16.618
Caption: and use design to run regular

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.679
Caption: experiments and use data to inform

00:39:16.618 --> 00:39:21.899
Caption: strategy so companies can innovate when

00:39:19.679 --> 00:39:25.078
Caption: they use design and data to explore

00:39:21.899 --> 00:39:26.578
Caption: experiment inform and your risk right so

00:39:25.079 --> 00:39:29.339
Caption: an example of where we&#39;ve used design

00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:31.619
Caption: experiments at hbf is what&#39;s in our

00:39:29.339 --> 00:39:33.300
Caption: future State service design work

00:39:31.618 --> 00:39:35.639
Caption: so this is where we were able to connect

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:37.619
Caption: the dots between the design strategy and

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:39.539
Caption: the business strategy where we were able

00:39:37.618 --> 00:39:42.239
Caption: to prove that we could get efficiency

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:44.820
Caption: gains and cost savings right so for

00:39:42.239 --> 00:39:47.520
Caption: example we were able to identify that 20

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:48.959
Caption: of our online sales for hbf were

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.419
Caption: actually members trying to change their

00:39:48.959 --> 00:39:53.879
Caption: level of cover and so this informed our

00:39:51.419 --> 00:39:56.699
Caption: design strategy where we&#39;ve prototyped

00:39:53.879 --> 00:39:58.618
Caption: and experimented with solutions for this

00:39:56.699 --> 00:40:01.139
Caption: and then we also identified that we

00:39:58.618 --> 00:40:02.879
Caption: could provide cost savings to hbf where

00:40:01.139 --> 00:40:05.159
Caption: we&#39;ve hypothesized that there will be

00:40:02.879 --> 00:40:07.559
Caption: decreases in manual handling costs and

00:40:05.159 --> 00:40:09.479
Caption: the number of calls into our cost center

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:13.160
Caption: and so moving forward we know that these

00:40:09.479 --> 00:40:13.159
Caption: are also metrics that we want to measure

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:17.520
Caption: and spread design throughout the

00:40:15.118 --> 00:40:18.899
Caption: business so when design works at scale

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.760
Caption: and it&#39;s embedded within the

00:40:18.899 --> 00:40:23.338
Caption: organization it&#39;s going to have more

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.500
Caption: impact and influence so our design

00:40:23.339 --> 00:40:26.940
Caption: practice over at hbf is still pretty

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:29.159
Caption: young and we&#39;re looking at still

00:40:26.939 --> 00:40:31.020
Caption: establishing things like processes and

00:40:29.159 --> 00:40:33.179
Caption: design standards and building out things

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:35.699
Caption: like our design system and these are

00:40:33.179 --> 00:40:37.379
Caption: going to help us work at scale and

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:39.659
Caption: that&#39;s exactly what happens when you see

00:40:37.379 --> 00:40:41.039
Caption: design maturity trying to build in an

00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:43.439
Caption: organization

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:45.660
Caption: and so what we do start seeing we do

00:40:43.439 --> 00:40:48.118
Caption: have signs of design culture throughout

00:40:45.659 --> 00:40:49.679
Caption: hbf so we&#39;re seeing things like we&#39;ve

00:40:48.118 --> 00:40:52.199
Caption: got to design an experience chapter

00:40:49.679 --> 00:40:53.939
Caption: we&#39;ve got business capabilities that are

00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:55.919
Caption: actually aligned to our customer Journey

00:40:53.939 --> 00:40:58.319
Caption: we&#39;ve got an established research

00:40:55.919 --> 00:41:01.078
Caption: program and we&#39;ve got a guiding value

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.579
Caption: proposition and design principles and

00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:05.479
Caption: these were actually created through

00:41:02.579 --> 00:41:08.040
Caption: things like research concept testing

00:41:05.479 --> 00:41:09.598
Caption: experts and employees that were

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.060
Caption: interviewed and there are North staff

00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:14.000
Caption: for our design work

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:16.500
Caption: foreign

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.139
Caption: so the design profession is still

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:21.719
Caption: evolving so only in the last 10 years

00:41:19.139 --> 00:41:24.059
Caption: the last decade have we seen designers a

00:41:21.719 --> 00:41:27.300
Caption: way to actually drive business success

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:29.160
Caption: and also to be used to solve for complex

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.780
Caption: human issues

00:41:29.159 --> 00:41:33.358
Caption: so we need to make sure we still don&#39;t

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.459
Caption: lose our producers and across people

00:41:33.358 --> 00:41:38.098
Caption: these are a design Specialists that sit

00:41:35.459 --> 00:41:39.719
Caption: in those first two orders but we need to

00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:42.000
Caption: also have our strategists and our

00:41:39.719 --> 00:41:43.919
Caption: Visionaries who work and thrive in

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.239
Caption: complexity especially in that fourth

00:41:43.919 --> 00:41:48.000
Caption: order

00:41:45.239 --> 00:41:50.098
Caption: and as technology continues to grow and

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.739
Caption: change so will Design

00:41:50.099 --> 00:41:54.960
Caption: so as a fun fact some people may have

00:41:52.739 --> 00:41:56.939
Caption: spotted this the majority of the images

00:41:54.959 --> 00:41:58.500
Caption: I&#39;ve used in this presentation were

00:41:56.939 --> 00:42:01.439
Caption: actually done through mid-journey it&#39;s

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:03.899
Caption: an AI image generator so things like

00:42:01.439 --> 00:42:05.879
Caption: artificial intelligence virtual reality

00:42:03.899 --> 00:42:07.799
Caption: the metaverse and automation are going

00:42:05.879 --> 00:42:09.479
Caption: to have huge impacts on design in the

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.820
Caption: future

00:42:09.479 --> 00:42:14.338
Caption: and so as we&#39;re facing into a more

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:16.979
Caption: complex world and as it starts to change

00:42:14.339 --> 00:42:19.440
Caption: faster than ever before designers are

00:42:16.979 --> 00:42:21.598
Caption: well placed to help for the soul for the

00:42:19.439 --> 00:42:23.040
Caption: big messy problems faces that come with

00:42:21.599 --> 00:42:24.390
Caption: this

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:34.939
Caption: thank you

00:42:24.389 --> 00:42:34.939
Caption: [Applause]
