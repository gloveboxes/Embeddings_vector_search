00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.968
Caption: thank you very much hello everybody

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:15.000
Caption: my name is Mandy just a quick thing

00:00:10.968 --> 00:00:17.608
Caption: there are some amazing illustrations in

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.528
Caption: my presentation now I didn&#39;t make those

00:00:17.608 --> 00:00:21.629
Caption: I&#39;m a developer that by burnt toys

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:24.209
Caption: creative I have a slide at the end they

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:25.858
Caption: are on Twitter they&#39;re awesome but

00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:27.389
Caption: you&#39;ll see them as you go through and

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:34.049
Caption: you&#39;ll appreciate them as much as I did

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:35.700
Caption: so why are we talking about HTML because

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:37.279
Caption: there are a lot of amazing things to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.989
Caption: talk about as we&#39;ve discovered today

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:45.058
Caption: with all the awesome streams and talks

00:00:39.988 --> 00:00:46.979
Caption: and things but for me I think the read

00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:48.538
Caption: it I get asked why I made this

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.930
Caption: presentation because a lot of people

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.030
Caption: think that HTML is really simple and you

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.099
Caption: know it I would say it probably is a

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:59.099
Caption: simple language to learn and work with

00:00:56.099 --> 00:01:01.439
Caption: we can get something going very quickly

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:04.588
Caption: we can accomplish things quite quite

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:09.540
Caption: quickly and it&#39;s very forgiving if we

00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:11.459
Caption: make mistakes but I think sometimes that

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.930
Caption: we make the mistake that assuming

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:15.569
Caption: because it&#39;s simple it&#39;s not valuable

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.658
Caption: and with you know all the amazing things

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:20.339
Caption: with JavaScript and CSS and all the

00:01:18.658 --> 00:01:22.289
Caption: other programming languages and

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:25.649
Caption: technologies that are out there we

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.900
Caption: forget that hTML is an important part of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.189
Caption: what we do on the web

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.810
Caption: so I want to tell you a little bit of a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.180
Caption: story about how I wrote this

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:35.099
Caption: presentation just for some context and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.529
Caption: why I came to write it and it was

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:40.290
Caption: because last year around this time I was

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:43.408
Caption: in Melbourne speaking at code and I was

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.259
Caption: talking about CSS and I happen to be on

00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:49.828
Caption: a CSS panel and a question came up and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.979
Caption: the question was does anybody hire

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.290
Caption: people who only write CSS and HTML and

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:56.879
Caption: the answer was no people don&#39;t do that

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.379
Caption: anymore because JavaScript is really

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:03.059
Caption: important and it&#39;s the most valuable

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:05.309
Caption: programming language for the web I was a

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:06.779
Caption: bit disappointed by this because I still

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:08.319
Caption: think that there&#39;s a lot of value in

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:10.839
Caption: HTML and CSS

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.179
Caption: and I think this value in people

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:15.518
Caption: learning it but because of that I wrote

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:18.759
Caption: an article you may or may not have read

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:25.119
Caption: it it was cold is there any value in

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:28.179
Caption: people who cannot write JavaScript the

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:30.789
Caption: titles a little bit emotive and for

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:36.548
Caption: everyone who bothered to read it before

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:38.289
Caption: commenting yeah there were a lot of

00:02:36.548 --> 00:02:40.500
Caption: comments and a lot of people didn&#39;t read

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:44.589
Caption: the article before they they responded

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.029
Caption: it basically the TI was that yes I do

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.438
Caption: think there&#39;s value in people who don&#39;t

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:49.869
Caption: write JavaScript I think there&#39;s value

00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:52.418
Caption: on people who only write JavaScript who

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:55.688
Caption: only write HTML and CSS who do all of it

00:02:52.419 --> 00:03:00.129
Caption: who do all sorts of things but I do

00:02:55.688 --> 00:03:02.468
Caption: think that people who write HTML and

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:04.238
Caption: have a deep understanding of it or at

00:03:02.468 --> 00:03:06.638
Caption: least use it to its full potential is

00:03:04.238 --> 00:03:10.718
Caption: becoming very rare at least it feels

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:13.150
Caption: that way to me and when I wrote this

00:03:10.718 --> 00:03:14.228
Caption: articles there were a lot of opinions

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:16.750
Caption: about it

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:19.089
Caption: a lot of them weren&#39;t very nice I don&#39;t

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.789
Caption: read the comments anymore but a lot of

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:23.979
Caption: other people had opinions about this and

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.929
Caption: they wrote blog posts and they had

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:28.569
Caption: discussions about it and podcasts and

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:31.358
Caption: tweets and all sorts of things I was all

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.628
Caption: around the purpose and the role that

00:03:31.358 --> 00:03:38.529
Caption: HTML and CSS in this case play in a

00:03:34.628 --> 00:03:40.119
Caption: world where JavaScript is king and is

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:43.298
Caption: what everybody cares about and what

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:47.048
Caption: everyone is hiring for but for me it&#39;s

00:03:43.298 --> 00:03:49.958
Caption: really really simple hTML is a part of

00:03:47.048 --> 00:03:52.750
Caption: the web it always has been and we need

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:55.029
Caption: to consider a variety of people tools

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.729
Caption: and technology that consume our webpages

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:59.888
Caption: and it&#39;s not just about the tech that we

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:02.889
Caption: have now like the browser&#39;s or assistive

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:04.989
Caption: technology search engines or even at

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.329
Caption: that consumer size it&#39;s about whatever

00:04:04.988 --> 00:04:09.759
Caption: comes next in the future we have

00:04:07.328 --> 00:04:12.339
Caption: technology now like the Google home and

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:15.069
Caption: Alexa what happens when they try to read

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:16.630
Caption: our websites are they going to interpret

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.799
Caption: it and consume it the way that we

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.639
Caption: expected it to so what I want to talk

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.770
Caption: about today

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.899
Caption: I don&#39;t want to teach you H tml what I

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:27.759
Caption: want to talk about is how different

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:30.759
Caption: technologies consume our websites and

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:32.919
Caption: consume our HTML and how we can do some

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.528
Caption: things to try and make sure that it has

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.259
Caption: its best opportunity and best chance to

00:04:35.528 --> 00:04:39.539
Caption: be interpreted and consumed and

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.968
Caption: represented the way that we want it to

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:46.269
Caption: regardless of where it is so that brings

00:04:42.968 --> 00:04:49.179
Caption: me to my talk which is function or HTML

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:54.028
Caption: now I must admit I mean obviously my

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:55.929
Caption: article was probably poorly titled I

00:04:54.028 --> 00:04:57.669
Caption: didn&#39;t really think about the whole

00:04:55.929 --> 00:05:02.438
Caption: functional programming thing when I

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:03.908
Caption: named this it that&#39;s not why I called it

00:05:02.438 --> 00:05:06.339
Caption: that I&#39;m not talking about functional

00:05:03.908 --> 00:05:07.688
Caption: programming and HTML so if you came here

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.309
Caption: thinking that I apologize

00:05:07.688 --> 00:05:12.669
Caption: you should still stay because it&#39;s gonna

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:15.759
Caption: be great but the reason I called it

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:19.000
Caption: funky ml is because I&#39;ve heard this

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:21.580
Caption: quote or phrase from developers that

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.859
Caption: I&#39;ve worked in for years and that&#39;s I&#39;m

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:26.888
Caption: just making it functional right now and

00:05:23.859 --> 00:05:29.978
Caption: what that typically translates to is I&#39;m

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.259
Caption: just writing the JavaScript you know the

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.559
Caption: functional parts I&#39;ll make it pretty

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:37.899
Caption: later and the problem with this is that

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:40.239
Caption: when we what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re

00:05:37.898 --> 00:05:41.978
Caption: relegating HTML and CSS to just making

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:44.049
Caption: things pretty and that couldn&#39;t be

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.908
Caption: further from the truth because for

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:48.938
Caption: something to be functional it should be

00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:50.919
Caption: practical and useful it needs to be

00:05:48.938 --> 00:05:53.408
Caption: working properly and as we expect it to

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.300
Caption: and not just for someone looking at it

00:05:53.408 --> 00:05:59.369
Caption: in a browser but for any technology that

00:05:55.299 --> 00:06:01.628
Caption: tries to look at our websites however

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:03.398
Caption: given that the browser is the most

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:07.539
Caption: common way that people consume our

00:06:03.398 --> 00:06:09.609
Caption: websites I want to talk quickly and very

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.039
Caption: very simply about how the browser

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:14.679
Caption: interprets our HTML now I&#39;m gonna

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:17.079
Caption: preface this with obviously it&#39;s way

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:20.859
Caption: more complicated than the three icons

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:25.778
Caption: I&#39;m going to show you but I just wanted

00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:29.558
Caption: to touch on it quickly so first we type

00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:32.738
Caption: our code like that cat in the gift

00:06:29.558 --> 00:06:34.178
Caption: and we give the browser our suite HTML

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:37.539
Caption: file and we&#39;re like cool

00:06:34.178 --> 00:06:40.168
Caption: there you go browser take my HTML and

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:44.558
Caption: then it takes that and it looks at it

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:47.259
Caption: but it doesn&#39;t just take our HTML and

00:06:44.558 --> 00:06:50.018
Caption: make the page like it actually has to

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:52.269
Caption: construct the page from that and what it

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:54.069
Caption: does is it gets this big long string and

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:55.299
Caption: it goes through and it starts to create

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:57.938
Caption: all of the parent and child

00:06:55.299 --> 00:07:01.209
Caption: relationships that we&#39;ve presented in

00:06:57.938 --> 00:07:02.979
Caption: our HTML and this it just goes through

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:05.079
Caption: everything until it gets to the end and

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:07.028
Caption: that&#39;s how we get the Dom tree or the

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:08.769
Caption: document object model and that&#39;s what

00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:10.598
Caption: you see typically when you inspect your

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:12.759
Caption: code in the browser like in Chrome or

00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:15.039
Caption: Firefox or whatever and that&#39;s how we

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:18.968
Caption: manipulate edit and move things around

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:20.468
Caption: in our documents now in order for it to

00:07:18.968 --> 00:07:22.539
Caption: actually display there are a couple more

00:07:20.468 --> 00:07:25.808
Caption: steps the paint and composite processes

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:29.019
Caption: which I won&#39;t go into but why does it

00:07:25.808 --> 00:07:30.908
Caption: matter what our browser and how it

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:34.979
Caption: interprets our HTML and I think it

00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:37.838
Caption: matters because what the browser does

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:40.329
Caption: constructs is based on what we give it

00:07:37.838 --> 00:07:43.178
Caption: so if we request a dim it gives us a div

00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:46.919
Caption: if we give it something that it doesn&#39;t

00:07:43.178 --> 00:07:49.838
Caption: understand or like dogs are amazing

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:51.128
Caption: element it&#39;s still gonna put that in the

00:07:49.838 --> 00:07:54.248
Caption: page and it&#39;s still going to render your

00:07:51.128 --> 00:07:55.988
Caption: content it doesn&#39;t care what the HTML

00:07:54.248 --> 00:07:57.188
Caption: elements are it&#39;s just going to

00:07:55.989 --> 00:08:00.759
Caption: construct the parent and child

00:07:57.188 --> 00:08:05.738
Caption: relationships it gives us what we&#39;ve

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:08.889
Caption: asked for so on that note we&#39;re just

00:08:05.739 --> 00:08:11.979
Caption: gonna take a brief sidestep and talk

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:16.389
Caption: about typescript has anyone here use

00:08:11.979 --> 00:08:18.669
Caption: typescript or flow or anything ok cool a

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:20.709
Caption: few people so for those that don&#39;t know

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:22.389
Caption: typescript is a typed JavaScript

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:25.959
Caption: language it does everything that

00:08:22.389 --> 00:08:28.438
Caption: JavaScript does plus other things and

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:30.879
Caption: basically it makes use of static typing

00:08:28.438 --> 00:08:33.758
Caption: so you can give your variable a type

00:08:30.878 --> 00:08:36.429
Caption: when you write your code and then what

00:08:33.758 --> 00:08:39.250
Caption: it does at compile time is it going when

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:40.750
Caption: it checks that the type of content or

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.479
Caption: data that you&#39;re passing through to your

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:47.109
Caption: variables matches what you asked for

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:49.809
Caption: and if it doesn&#39;t it throws an error so

00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:52.719
Caption: this is some type script it&#39;s an

00:08:49.809 --> 00:08:55.679
Caption: interface for a dog got a name which is

00:08:52.719 --> 00:08:59.199
Caption: a string an age which is a number and a

00:08:55.679 --> 00:09:02.739
Caption: is fluffy which is a boolean so true or

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.869
Caption: false because not all dogs are fluffy

00:09:02.739 --> 00:09:10.270
Caption: they&#39;re all amazing but they&#39;re not all

00:09:04.869 --> 00:09:13.049
Caption: fluffy and in this case we&#39;re assigning

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:15.610
Caption: the type to our data and whether or not

00:09:13.049 --> 00:09:18.159
Caption: we want to get what we want to get from

00:09:15.609 --> 00:09:19.899
Caption: that content and if I pass a number to

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:21.849
Caption: my name it&#39;ll throw an error it will say

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.100
Caption: no no you said you wanted a string

00:09:21.849 --> 00:09:27.130
Caption: you&#39;ve given me a number and you can go

00:09:24.099 --> 00:09:29.589
Caption: and do something about that and what

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:32.500
Caption: we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re telling types with

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:34.480
Caption: what we expect our data to be and this

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.609
Caption: makes debugging reading writing and

00:09:34.479 --> 00:09:39.190
Caption: working with our code a lot easier at

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:41.169
Caption: least in my opinion we&#39;re being really

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:44.140
Caption: explicit about what the shape of our

00:09:41.169 --> 00:09:48.969
Caption: data should be and this is pretty much

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:50.440
Caption: what we do in HTML we specify whether we

00:09:48.969 --> 00:09:53.739
Caption: want a heading what kind of heading it

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:57.900
Caption: should be if we need a list navigation

00:09:53.739 --> 00:10:02.020
Caption: items links buttons bold italic images

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:04.420
Caption: captions we&#39;re choosing an element that

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.850
Caption: both best represents our content and

00:10:04.419 --> 00:10:09.489
Caption: there are a whole range of elements that

00:10:06.849 --> 00:10:12.130
Caption: we can use in order to markup our

00:10:09.489 --> 00:10:14.169
Caption: content correctly and we do this for the

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.179
Caption: same reason we do it in tight script to

00:10:14.169 --> 00:10:18.940
Caption: define the shape of our content to make

00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:21.849
Caption: it easier to work read and write and not

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:25.570
Caption: just for us but for whatever tech tries

00:10:21.849 --> 00:10:27.940
Caption: to consumers and in typescript we have

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:30.729
Caption: this concept of in any time and in any

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.919
Caption: type means basically that my name can be

00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:37.179
Caption: anything it can be a number a boolean a

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:40.959
Caption: string and this can be useful on

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:43.510
Caption: occasion but if you type everything as

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.940
Caption: any you start to lose the benefits of

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.650
Caption: the language because you&#39;re no longer

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.229
Caption: getting the type checking it&#39;s not going

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:53.740
Caption: to throw an error when you pass a number

00:10:50.229 --> 00:10:55.989
Caption: to name the safety that typescript

00:10:53.739 --> 00:10:57.039
Caption: provides is gone and it becomes

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:59.779
Caption: pointless

00:10:57.039 --> 00:11:03.139
Caption: and this is the same in HTML if you use

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:07.670
Caption: dibs everywhere you&#39;re not making the

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:09.440
Caption: most of the language so because of this

00:11:07.669 --> 00:11:11.690
Caption: it&#39;s really important that we actively

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.700
Caption: choose what the right element for our

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:18.229
Caption: content is and you don&#39;t just default to

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:20.480
Caption: using a div and if we look at a really

00:11:18.229 --> 00:11:23.419
Caption: simple example of a page about why dogs

00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:24.589
Caption: are good just using games this is what

00:11:23.419 --> 00:11:26.869
Caption: it looks like in the browser

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:29.960
Caption: it&#39;s just default browser styling

00:11:26.869 --> 00:11:32.330
Caption: everything is a div even the links which

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:35.300
Caption: I&#39;ve added javascript on click event to

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.890
Caption: to make it clickable and you can see

00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:39.409
Caption: that the page is a bit unstructured

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:42.770
Caption: there isn&#39;t really much meaning except

00:11:39.409 --> 00:11:46.339
Caption: from the whitespace that we get from the

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:48.830
Caption: div being a block element whereas if we

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:52.880
Caption: look at a more semantic page which has

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:55.369
Caption: properly chosen HTML elements like lists

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.280
Caption: and links and images and big captions

00:11:55.369 --> 00:12:01.520
Caption: headings you can see a structure starts

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.710
Caption: to form and there&#39;s value in this it&#39;s

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.710
Caption: already more practical and more useful

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:09.650
Caption: than this page because we we have a

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:13.130
Caption: hierarchy and you might be thinking well

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:15.530
Caption: okay sure but I could make this look

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:17.780
Caption: like this with CSS and you&#39;re right you

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:20.060
Caption: could but the problem with that is that

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:22.580
Caption: not everything that consumes your page

00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:26.599
Caption: is going to have access to your CSS and

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:28.549
Caption: your JavaScript they&#39;re going to

00:12:26.599 --> 00:12:30.169
Caption: evaluate your page based on the HTML

00:12:28.549 --> 00:12:31.519
Caption: that you&#39;ve provided it doesn&#39;t care

00:12:30.169 --> 00:12:35.299
Caption: about all the other stuff that you&#39;ve

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.790
Caption: done and it&#39;s easy to assume that the

00:12:35.299 --> 00:12:39.950
Caption: way our HTML is going to be consumed is

00:12:37.789 --> 00:12:42.250
Caption: gonna be the same way that we as

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:46.220
Caption: developers and the creators of the site

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:48.950
Caption: can see it in our browser but there are

00:12:46.219 --> 00:12:51.679
Caption: so many different technologies that will

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:55.010
Caption: try to read use understand and consume

00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:57.859
Caption: our HTML and they rely on us to use the

00:12:55.010 --> 00:13:01.130
Caption: language properly in order for it to

00:12:57.859 --> 00:13:04.190
Caption: make sense so the first one I wanted to

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:06.950
Caption: talk about is assistive tab now using

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:08.169
Caption: HTML as its intended helps us to build

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.028
Caption: web pages and

00:13:08.169 --> 00:13:12.010
Caption: vacations that can be used by a wide

00:13:10.028 --> 00:13:15.398
Caption: range of people in a wide range of

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:16.989
Caption: circumstances and there are a bunch of

00:13:15.398 --> 00:13:19.359
Caption: different options in the assistive tech

00:13:16.989 --> 00:13:23.109
Caption: space there&#39;s screen readers brow

00:13:19.359 --> 00:13:25.719
Caption: readers switches even the Google home

00:13:23.109 --> 00:13:29.018
Caption: and Alexa are being used by people as a

00:13:25.719 --> 00:13:30.909
Caption: form of assistive technology I&#39;m gonna

00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:33.208
Caption: focus on the screen reader today mainly

00:13:30.909 --> 00:13:35.409
Caption: because that&#39;s the one I know how to use

00:13:33.208 --> 00:13:38.739
Caption: yes

00:13:35.409 --> 00:13:40.539
Caption: but before I do my screen reader jenamae

00:13:38.739 --> 00:13:42.039
Caption: I wanted to talk about the accessibility

00:13:40.539 --> 00:13:44.250
Caption: tree because I think a lot of people

00:13:42.039 --> 00:13:47.588
Caption: don&#39;t actually know that it exists I

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:49.630
Caption: much like the browser creates the Dom it

00:13:47.588 --> 00:13:51.638
Caption: takes the don tree and it modifies it to

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.169
Caption: form something that&#39;s useful to

00:13:51.638 --> 00:13:56.169
Caption: assistive technology and that&#39;s what the

00:13:53.169 --> 00:13:58.958
Caption: accessibility tree is and it uses native

00:13:56.169 --> 00:14:01.359
Caption: semantics to create an interface for

00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:03.669
Caption: reading and navigating the page for

00:14:01.359 --> 00:14:05.638
Caption: example a screen reader is able to

00:14:03.669 --> 00:14:09.820
Caption: interpret the accessibility tree and

00:14:05.638 --> 00:14:11.679
Caption: reproduce the text-to-speech and some

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.018
Caption: things are stripped out so anything that

00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:16.809
Caption: is not useful for someone who can&#39;t see

00:14:14.018 --> 00:14:19.958
Caption: the page that&#39;s removed but other things

00:14:16.809 --> 00:14:21.609
Caption: are added in so around forms and

00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:24.719
Caption: interactions for example additional

00:14:21.609 --> 00:14:30.429
Caption: context is provided to make

00:14:24.719 --> 00:14:32.799
Caption: understanding the page easier so if we

00:14:30.429 --> 00:14:37.679
Caption: take that deep only example off dogs are

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:40.419
Caption: good earlier what does that sound like

00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:44.609
Caption: to a spring we know what what does a div

00:14:40.419 --> 00:14:47.078
Caption: only page how does it get interpreted by

00:14:44.609 --> 00:14:50.338
Caption: assistive technologies like a screen

00:14:47.078 --> 00:14:52.659
Caption: reader so to make it easier for you

00:14:50.338 --> 00:14:54.429
Caption: because when I did this the first time

00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:56.229
Caption: for my co-workers they couldn&#39;t follow

00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:58.809
Caption: along and they were very confused

00:14:56.229 --> 00:15:01.000
Caption: I have captions which are down the

00:14:58.809 --> 00:15:02.528
Caption: bottom and then also it&#39;ll highlight

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.619
Caption: every line as we go through this is

00:15:02.528 --> 00:15:09.309

00:15:50.229 --> 00:15:55.239
Caption: let&#39;s address that seeing it was the

00:15:51.849 --> 00:15:57.099
Caption: last thing I did that by accident if I&#39;m

00:15:55.239 --> 00:15:59.919
Caption: being honest I screenshotted that

00:15:57.099 --> 00:16:02.440
Caption: picture of my dog jello Michelangelo

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:05.950
Caption: just FYI the screen reader clearly had

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.750
Caption: trouble with that from Instagram and I

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:10.510
Caption: forgot to change the file name and

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:13.419
Caption: because I was making a not awesome HTML

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:16.600
Caption: page I didn&#39;t put an alt tag on it so it

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:21.119
Caption: had to read out a very long really

00:16:16.599 --> 00:16:25.839
Caption: horrible filename so lesson number one

00:16:21.119 --> 00:16:29.830
Caption: rename your files um or better add an

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:31.720
Caption: alt tag but you know when you when

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.420
Caption: you&#39;re reading through that page it it&#39;s

00:16:31.719 --> 00:16:37.119
Caption: kind of just a big blob of text right

00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:38.589
Caption: and it didn&#39;t even tell me that the top

00:16:37.119 --> 00:16:40.210
Caption: three things were linked there was no

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.559
Caption: way for me to know that because the

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.600
Caption: screen reader doesn&#39;t know that those

00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:45.729
Caption: divs with that on click event were

00:16:43.599 --> 00:16:48.579
Caption: actually pages that that I could go to

00:16:45.729 --> 00:16:50.079
Caption: and I could visit and that can be pretty

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.540
Caption: confusing because you&#39;ve just kind of

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:55.420
Caption: got a guess based on the fact that there

00:16:52.539 --> 00:16:57.219
Caption: are no other words after it but

00:16:55.419 --> 00:16:59.380
Caption: typically people using assistive

00:16:57.219 --> 00:17:01.509
Caption: technology will listen to this at a much

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.060
Caption: faster pace so they might not notice

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:06.940
Caption: that if there&#39;s no hierarchy or

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.950
Caption: structure there and often they would use

00:17:06.939 --> 00:17:10.689
Caption: keyboard shortcuts or other ways to

00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:12.429
Caption: navigate around the page so they don&#39;t

00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:14.529
Caption: have to read it from top to bottom and

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:17.050
Caption: sometimes they do this with headings for

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:19.030
Caption: example so they can skip to different

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.310
Caption: headings on the page and go oh yeah I

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:24.520
Caption: want to I want to find out why they&#39;re

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:26.980
Caption: good or the related links or did you

Caption: name on my image which is a shame

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:44.320
Caption: because then they won&#39;t find out why

00:17:40.869 --> 00:17:47.199
Caption: dogs are good so what about the

00:17:44.319 --> 00:17:48.549
Caption: structured more semantic version of my

00:18:32.229 --> 00:18:36.250
Caption: in that example that it&#39;s a lot better

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:38.470
Caption: it tells me upfront that I&#39;ve got

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:40.959
Caption: navigation items how many there are that

00:18:38.469 --> 00:18:42.579
Caption: I visited a link what links ah it tells

00:18:40.959 --> 00:18:45.010
Caption: me what a heading one is what a heading

00:18:42.579 --> 00:18:49.059

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.990
Caption: context and information to navigate the

00:18:51.189 --> 00:18:55.799
Caption: page with and this isn&#39;t just valuable

00:18:52.989 --> 00:18:59.800
Caption: for screen readers but potentially also

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:02.710
Caption: really useful for google home and Alexa

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:06.369
Caption: to be able to navigate around the page

00:19:02.709 --> 00:19:08.799
Caption: based on voice commands so my point here

00:19:06.369 --> 00:19:11.260
Caption: is don&#39;t just use dibs because you&#39;re

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.840
Caption: losing out all that free information

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:16.300
Caption: that you get by just picking the right

00:19:13.839 --> 00:19:18.189
Caption: HTML element otherwise you&#39;re going to

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.020
Caption: have to put a lot more work in to try

00:19:18.189 --> 00:19:23.079
Caption: and get that content to make sense to

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:25.330
Caption: someone else and I&#39;m gonna quote

00:19:23.079 --> 00:19:28.209
Caption: Jeffrey&#39;s old win because I read this

00:19:25.329 --> 00:19:30.309
Caption: article recently and I loved it but to

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:33.429
Caption: build for people and the long term then

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:35.980
Caption: simple structural semantic hTML was best

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:39.100
Caption: each element deployed for its intended

00:19:35.979 --> 00:19:43.089
Caption: purpose don&#39;t use a div when you mean a

00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:45.309
Caption: P or a paragraph and there are a lot of

00:19:43.089 --> 00:19:46.299
Caption: things that we can do to make a HTML

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.030
Caption: read

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.220
Caption: better for screen readers and other

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.390
Caption: technologies like search engines as well

00:19:50.219 --> 00:19:54.849
Caption: and one of those things is using

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:57.190
Caption: sectioning elements and what sectioning

00:19:54.849 --> 00:19:58.869
Caption: elements do is they create a document

00:19:57.189 --> 00:20:01.209
Caption: outline and that&#39;s used by the

00:19:58.869 --> 00:20:05.439
Caption: accessibility tree to form an outline of

00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:07.929
Caption: what is on the page now prior to html5

00:20:05.439 --> 00:20:09.039
Caption: we didn&#39;t have sectioning elements we

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:11.230
Caption: just had dibs

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.270
Caption: and that made automating a document

00:20:11.229 --> 00:20:15.880
Caption: outline impossible because there&#39;s no

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:19.060
Caption: way to know the difference between a

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:21.219
Caption: section marked off as a div and just a

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:25.450
Caption: div that&#39;s used for presentational

00:20:21.219 --> 00:20:27.579
Caption: purposes so now that we have sectioning

00:20:25.449 --> 00:20:29.469
Caption: elements the browser can automate a

00:20:27.579 --> 00:20:32.439
Caption: document outline that can be used by

00:20:29.469 --> 00:20:35.109
Caption: search engines screen readers and other

00:20:32.439 --> 00:20:37.899
Caption: apps and code that try to read our page

00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:39.849
Caption: and that&#39;s incredibly valuable and

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.820
Caption: powerful and it&#39;s not that much work to

00:20:39.849 --> 00:20:47.500
Caption: implement now there are four sectioning

00:20:42.819 --> 00:20:49.509
Caption: elements the section unsurprising this

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.329
Caption: represents a standalone section that has

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:55.150
Caption: no other semantic meaning and because

00:20:52.329 --> 00:20:57.309
Caption: it&#39;s used in the document outline you

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:59.140
Caption: should never use this if you want a

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:02.350
Caption: generic container if you want a generic

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.750
Caption: container use a div I know I said don&#39;t

00:21:02.349 --> 00:21:07.140
Caption: just use dibs but

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:09.939
Caption: generic containers are what divs are for

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:13.239
Caption: the article is another one and this is

00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:15.399
Caption: used for self-contained parts of the

00:21:13.239 --> 00:21:19.150
Caption: page so if you think about content that

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:22.030
Caption: can be redistributed or reusable like in

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.800
Caption: syndication use the article element and

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.859
Caption: this is used a lot for blog news

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.420
Caption: articles forums that kind of thing now

00:21:26.859 --> 00:21:30.640
Caption: there&#39;s another one which you heard in

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:34.090
Caption: the screenreader demo this provides

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:35.979
Caption: context around navigation items and it&#39;s

00:21:34.089 --> 00:21:38.500
Caption: used for a table of contents may now

00:21:35.979 --> 00:21:41.380
Caption: have that kind of stuff and then there&#39;s

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:45.069
Caption: the aside which is my favorite this is

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:47.500
Caption: used to markup content around but that&#39;s

00:21:45.069 --> 00:21:49.869
Caption: not part of the main outline and I like

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.430
Caption: this because it&#39;s great in like news

00:21:49.869 --> 00:21:53.140
Caption: articles for example when people are

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.550
Caption: trying to shove stuff in the middle of

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.250
Caption: that article that you&#39;re trying to read

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:58.489
Caption: if you mark that up as an aside it&#39;s

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:01.489
Caption: ignored in the main

00:21:58.489 --> 00:22:04.219
Caption: outline of the page sidebars call-out

00:22:01.489 --> 00:22:06.558
Caption: boxes that kind of thing and you can use

00:22:04.219 --> 00:22:09.500
Caption: these in conjunction with a more clear

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:12.199
Caption: structure and hierarchy and this allows

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.239
Caption: search engines to better understand the

00:22:12.199 --> 00:22:17.709
Caption: content that we&#39;re writing and what&#39;s

00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:20.808
Caption: the most valuable content on the site

00:22:17.709 --> 00:22:23.000
Caption: headings are one thing that a lot of

00:22:20.808 --> 00:22:26.359
Caption: people don&#39;t use that well to be honest

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.239
Caption: the h1 is used to represent the main

00:22:26.359 --> 00:22:32.540
Caption: purpose of the page page 2 to h6

00:22:29.239 --> 00:22:34.550
Caption: all subheadings and a screen reader can

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:37.820
Caption: take a list of headings from your page

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:39.890
Caption: create that and allow users to get a

00:22:37.819 --> 00:22:41.659
Caption: read through all of those and decide if

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:44.750
Caption: they want to actually read the page at

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:46.340
Caption: all it gives them an idea of what&#39;s on

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.170
Caption: the page and that&#39;s really really useful

00:22:46.339 --> 00:22:52.189
Caption: so you should always use a heading

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:55.400
Caption: inside your sections a header element is

00:22:52.189 --> 00:22:57.169
Caption: another one this isn&#39;t a sectioning

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.000
Caption: element but it is used to provide

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:02.030
Caption: context around the header of your page

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.770
Caption: like main navigation search logos that

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:05.599
Caption: kind of thing and there&#39;s a footer

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:07.760
Caption: element as well which does the same for

00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:09.169
Caption: footer content and a main element that

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:13.849
Caption: does the same for the main part of your

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:16.309
Caption: page but we should also make the most of

00:23:13.849 --> 00:23:19.099
Caption: built-in functionality because we&#39;ve got

00:23:16.308 --> 00:23:22.399
Caption: enough to do right we have to do linking

00:23:19.099 --> 00:23:28.969
Caption: right tests right a shit-ton a

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:32.780
Caption: JavaScript you know I don&#39;t have time to

00:23:28.969 --> 00:23:34.609
Caption: rebuild the web I&#39;ve got other things to

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:37.309
Caption: do and a really good example of that is

00:23:34.609 --> 00:23:40.010
Caption: the link or the anchor element this

00:23:37.308 --> 00:23:43.159
Caption: comes with so much for free the people

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:45.320
Caption: are not taking advantage of it navigates

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.570
Caption: the user to a new page it changes the

00:23:45.319 --> 00:23:49.909
Caption: URL it causes the browser to redraw and

00:23:47.569 --> 00:23:53.089
Caption: refresh its focusable with the hey

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:55.599
Caption: stress element attribute it can register

00:23:53.089 --> 00:24:00.189
Caption: a click with the Enter key it has

00:23:55.599 --> 00:24:03.650
Caption: visited focus hover link and active

00:24:00.189 --> 00:24:05.119
Caption: States and it allows opening in a window

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.950
Caption: all for free you don&#39;t have to do

00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:08.079
Caption: anything that will just work when you

00:24:06.949 --> 00:24:09.729
Caption: use the link

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:13.299
Caption: and yet for some reason we keep using

00:24:09.729 --> 00:24:15.219
Caption: dims and trying to recreate that I don&#39;t

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:17.920
Caption: know about you but I would rather be

00:24:15.219 --> 00:24:19.599
Caption: padding my dog than spending time making

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.520
Caption: something open in a new window with

00:24:19.599 --> 00:24:24.609
Caption: JavaScript and the same goes for the

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.560
Caption: button element right this can be focused

00:24:24.609 --> 00:24:29.140
Caption: by default you can click it with the

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.060
Caption: space key it can be disabled with the

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.849
Caption: disabled attribute it can submit and

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:37.150
Caption: reset a form you can stroke focus hover

00:24:33.849 --> 00:24:39.819
Caption: active and disabled States by default I

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:42.880
Caption: don&#39;t spend your time remaking something

00:24:39.819 --> 00:24:44.679
Caption: that already exists and if you don&#39;t

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.890
Caption: know when to use a button versus an

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:51.430
Caption: anchor or a link a good rule of thumb is

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:54.969
Caption: a link navigates to a new page a button

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:56.650
Caption: toggles something in your interface the

00:24:54.969 --> 00:25:00.099
Caption: way that I like to think of it is if it

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:02.260
Caption: has a href it&#39;s a link if it doesn&#39;t or

00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:05.349
Caption: you&#39;re disabling the hey trap it&#39;s

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:06.940
Caption: probably a button I mean obviously there

00:25:05.349 --> 00:25:10.839
Caption: are exceptions to this but that&#39;s a good

00:25:06.939 --> 00:25:12.909
Caption: place to start and probably the best

00:25:10.839 --> 00:25:14.650
Caption: thing about HTML is that you can combine

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:18.190
Caption: them to create even better and more

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:20.969
Caption: improved context and a great example of

00:25:18.189 --> 00:25:23.979
Caption: this is the figure in the figcaption

00:25:20.969 --> 00:25:26.859
Caption: these are self-contained units of

00:25:23.979 --> 00:25:28.299
Caption: content and it means that you can move

00:25:26.859 --> 00:25:28.959
Caption: it around the page and it&#39;ll still make

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.770
Caption: sense

00:25:28.959 --> 00:25:34.419
Caption: and inside the fit caption you can put

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.700
Caption: other elements like paragraphs and

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:41.890
Caption: headings to give even more information

00:25:36.699 --> 00:25:43.419
Caption: in context and inside of the figure with

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:45.849
Caption: the figcaption you can put the pre

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.920
Caption: element and the pre element marks are

00:25:45.849 --> 00:25:49.959
Caption: pre-formatted text and if you combine

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.050
Caption: that with the figure in the figcaption

00:25:49.959 --> 00:25:55.089
Caption: then you get a more accessible pre

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.920
Caption: formatted text on your page and when

00:25:55.089 --> 00:25:59.859
Caption: this is rendered with a mono spaced font

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:02.170
Caption: on its own the screen reader tries to

00:25:59.859 --> 00:26:05.739
Caption: read out each character by itself which

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:09.250
Caption: is not great so the figure and

00:26:05.739 --> 00:26:11.489
Caption: figcaption marks the coin up as a figure

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:14.770
Caption: and the feed caption as the description

00:26:11.489 --> 00:26:17.290
Caption: and the abbreviation and definition

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:19.450
Caption: elements which are my favorite these are

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.789
Caption: so great I wish people use these more it

00:26:19.449 --> 00:26:23.408
Caption: allows browsers and BOTS and

00:26:21.788 --> 00:26:25.238
Caption: to recognize that a phrases being

00:26:23.409 --> 00:26:28.960
Caption: defined and that that acronym is

00:26:25.239 --> 00:26:32.139
Caption: associated to the phrase so for example

00:26:28.959 --> 00:26:34.989
Caption: I actually put code up for this because

00:26:32.139 --> 00:26:36.729
Caption: it&#39;s hard to explain but we have a

00:26:34.989 --> 00:26:38.919
Caption: description about the International good

00:26:36.729 --> 00:26:42.359
Caption: dogs association which determines that

00:26:38.918 --> 00:26:46.418
Caption: all dogs are good and we have an

00:26:42.359 --> 00:26:48.099
Caption: abbreviation of IG da and that&#39;s wrapped

00:26:46.418 --> 00:26:50.199
Caption: in the abbreviation element and that has

00:26:48.099 --> 00:26:53.408
Caption: a title of international good dogs

00:26:50.199 --> 00:26:54.819
Caption: association and then inside that outside

00:26:53.409 --> 00:26:57.489
Caption: of that we wrap it in the definition

00:26:54.819 --> 00:27:02.378
Caption: element and that says that this

00:26:57.489 --> 00:27:03.639
Caption: paragraph is defined defining IG da

00:27:02.379 --> 00:27:06.549
Caption: which is an abbreviation of

00:27:03.639 --> 00:27:08.139
Caption: international good dog&#39;s Association and

00:27:06.548 --> 00:27:12.038
Caption: all the tech understands that because

00:27:08.139 --> 00:27:14.340
Caption: it&#39;s part of HTML and there are heaps of

00:27:12.038 --> 00:27:17.798
Caption: elements there&#39;s the progress bar

00:27:14.339 --> 00:27:20.079
Caption: there&#39;s bi-directional which is the by

00:27:17.798 --> 00:27:21.538
Caption: day one that makes text go right to left

00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:24.518
Caption: instead of left to right

00:27:21.538 --> 00:27:26.528
Caption: KBD might sup keyboard controls if you

00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:28.330
Caption: need to display those there&#39;s video

00:27:26.529 --> 00:27:34.779
Caption: which gives you video controls there&#39;s a

00:27:28.329 --> 00:27:36.459
Caption: dialogue audio time and this is just a

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:38.049
Caption: tiny little bit and you don&#39;t have to

00:27:36.459 --> 00:27:39.878
Caption: remember them all because the Mozilla

00:27:38.048 --> 00:27:42.339
Caption: developer Network has a totally amazing

00:27:39.879 --> 00:27:44.200
Caption: page that you can just search and it&#39;ll

00:27:42.339 --> 00:27:47.528
Caption: give you back a list of them and it&#39;ll

00:27:44.199 --> 00:27:50.859
Caption: tell you how you can use them and I kind

00:27:47.529 --> 00:27:52.330
Caption: of think that like I said before with

00:27:50.859 --> 00:27:54.369
Caption: all of the other things that we need to

00:27:52.329 --> 00:27:58.028
Caption: do with our deployment processes and our

00:27:54.369 --> 00:28:01.029
Caption: build chains and our naming things our

00:27:58.029 --> 00:28:02.830
Caption: tests and using typescript like make

00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:05.049
Caption: your life easier and see the heap of

00:28:02.829 --> 00:28:06.788
Caption: time by just picking the right HTML

00:28:05.048 --> 00:28:09.428
Caption: element because it makes your project

00:28:06.788 --> 00:28:11.798
Caption: more understandable but it also makes

00:28:09.428 --> 00:28:13.959
Caption: like to me as a developer but also to

00:28:11.798 --> 00:28:17.648
Caption: people trying to use it and technology

00:28:13.959 --> 00:28:19.089
Caption: trying to consume it but I could talk

00:28:17.649 --> 00:28:19.598
Caption: about those all day and I don&#39;t want to

00:28:19.089 --> 00:28:23.258
Caption: do that

00:28:19.598 --> 00:28:26.529
Caption: so what I want to show you is the way

00:28:23.259 --> 00:28:29.200
Caption: that some other tech consumes our HTML

00:28:26.529 --> 00:28:31.480
Caption: and a really good example of this is

00:28:29.199 --> 00:28:33.339
Caption: reading apps like instant paper and

00:28:31.479 --> 00:28:34.719
Caption: pocket and what they do is they take

00:28:33.339 --> 00:28:38.319
Caption: structured content and they

00:28:34.719 --> 00:28:40.569
Caption: display it with custom styles and they

00:28:38.319 --> 00:28:42.459
Caption: provide improved readability and options

00:28:40.569 --> 00:28:44.979
Caption: for personalization and people can use

00:28:42.459 --> 00:28:47.048
Caption: these for all sorts of reasons better

00:28:44.979 --> 00:28:50.589
Caption: accessibility so improve contrast for

00:28:47.048 --> 00:28:52.269
Caption: example or the aesthetics because what

00:28:50.589 --> 00:28:55.178
Caption: these do is they strip out all of the

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:58.890
Caption: extra junk on a page like ads for

00:28:55.178 --> 00:29:02.048
Caption: example so it&#39;s just a nicer experience

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:04.119
Caption: now I use instapaper so this is the one

00:29:02.048 --> 00:29:05.769
Caption: I&#39;m gonna start with and what this does

00:29:04.119 --> 00:29:07.298
Caption: is it allows you to save articles and

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:10.750
Caption: you can read them later in their reading

00:29:07.298 --> 00:29:14.109
Caption: mode and this is what the diversion

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:16.150
Caption: looks like in their reading mode now it

00:29:14.109 --> 00:29:16.739
Caption: kind of looks like the same as before

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:21.849
Caption: right

00:29:16.739 --> 00:29:23.918
Caption: but it&#39;s different color not very well

00:29:21.849 --> 00:29:26.650
Caption: structured we already understand that

00:29:23.918 --> 00:29:29.709
Caption: but what about the better more semantic

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:31.299
Caption: version it kind of looks like the other

00:29:29.709 --> 00:29:33.189
Caption: page right they&#39;ve managed to apply

00:29:31.298 --> 00:29:38.408
Caption: their own styles to my links and my

00:29:33.189 --> 00:29:39.969
Caption: lists and my headings but also at the

00:29:38.409 --> 00:29:41.679
Caption: top you&#39;ll notice the links aren&#39;t there

00:29:39.969 --> 00:29:43.839
Caption: anymore and that&#39;s because we don&#39;t need

00:29:41.678 --> 00:29:45.579
Caption: the links in this context and because I

00:29:43.839 --> 00:29:48.428
Caption: mark them up as a navigation item it can

00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:51.069
Caption: remove those which is great it&#39;s also

00:29:48.428 --> 00:29:52.959
Caption: put my name and the date at the top and

00:29:51.069 --> 00:29:57.639
Caption: this information is really important in

00:29:52.959 --> 00:30:00.729
Caption: Instapaper because I have like 400

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:03.849
Caption: articles that I&#39;m meaning to get to if I

00:30:00.729 --> 00:30:04.900
Caption: don&#39;t have who wrote it and when how am

00:30:03.849 --> 00:30:07.418
Caption: I going to know if that&#39;s still relevant

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:11.140
Caption: to me or if I can trust the person that

00:30:07.418 --> 00:30:12.759
Caption: wrote that article or if I think Mandy

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:16.030
Caption: Michael writes really sweet articles

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:20.079
Caption: with non-offensive titles I can go and

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:21.520
Caption: read those later it&#39;s really important

00:30:20.079 --> 00:30:23.319
Caption: not just for the user but from a

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.479
Caption: publishers perspective because if I want

00:30:23.319 --> 00:30:27.519
Caption: people to think my content is great and

00:30:25.479 --> 00:30:28.869
Caption: I don&#39;t tell them that I wrote it how

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.750
Caption: will they know to come back and read

00:30:28.869 --> 00:30:33.308
Caption: more of what I&#39;ve written

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:35.798
Caption: now pocket is another example which does

00:30:33.308 --> 00:30:37.270
Caption: the same thing as Instapaper but this

00:30:35.798 --> 00:30:39.189
Caption: one&#39;s really interesting I didn&#39;t

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.959
Caption: actually use pocket so I had to play

00:30:39.189 --> 00:30:44.199
Caption: around with this a bit to get it to work

00:30:40.959 --> 00:30:47.709
Caption: and this is what it looks like in the

00:30:44.199 --> 00:30:48.518
Caption: web view this is both of my my pages one

00:30:47.709 --> 00:30:52.869
Caption: with divs why

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:56.468
Caption: with semantic HTML this first one

00:30:52.869 --> 00:30:58.119
Caption: obviously the div version you&#39;ll notice

00:30:56.468 --> 00:31:00.848
Caption: that the title is different that&#39;s

00:30:58.119 --> 00:31:02.799
Caption: because there&#39;s no h1 on my page so

00:31:00.848 --> 00:31:04.689
Caption: instead of putting the h1 in there use

00:31:02.798 --> 00:31:07.208
Caption: the title element which is the only

00:31:04.689 --> 00:31:09.939
Caption: title that could find there&#39;s no image

00:31:07.208 --> 00:31:12.218
Caption: even though I did use an image element

00:31:09.939 --> 00:31:14.648
Caption: in the page to load the image in it

00:31:12.218 --> 00:31:17.499
Caption: couldn&#39;t find it sometimes it would load

00:31:14.649 --> 00:31:18.968
Caption: random text from the page like from

00:31:17.499 --> 00:31:22.179
Caption: anywhere it didn&#39;t really matter where

00:31:18.968 --> 00:31:24.428
Caption: which was weird I also couldn&#39;t read it

00:31:22.178 --> 00:31:27.609
Caption: in there reading up it I had to open it

00:31:24.428 --> 00:31:29.588
Caption: in a new window from the original page

00:31:27.609 --> 00:31:30.968
Caption: and it was really clear to me that

00:31:29.588 --> 00:31:34.149
Caption: Pocket was having a bit of trouble

00:31:30.968 --> 00:31:36.819
Caption: understanding what to do with my div

00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:39.009
Caption: only page it even took longer to process

00:31:36.819 --> 00:31:43.479
Caption: which is weird because the page isn&#39;t

00:31:39.009 --> 00:31:46.389
Caption: very big and the most interesting thing

00:31:43.479 --> 00:31:47.979
Caption: I came across was the desktop app so

00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:49.570
Caption: while the mobile app I couldn&#39;t read it

00:31:47.979 --> 00:31:52.859
Caption: in there a fat all the desktop one I

00:31:49.569 --> 00:31:56.498
Caption: could but it flagged my content as being

00:31:52.859 --> 00:31:59.859
Caption: not article content and that I thought

00:31:56.499 --> 00:32:02.229
Caption: was a bit weird and from a like

00:31:59.859 --> 00:32:04.208
Caption: publisher perspective or from a brand

00:32:02.229 --> 00:32:06.458
Caption: perspective that&#39;s probably quite

00:32:04.208 --> 00:32:08.468
Caption: damaging because when I saw that the

00:32:06.458 --> 00:32:10.928
Caption: first thing I thought was oh he says

00:32:08.468 --> 00:32:12.369
Caption: something like bad about that page and

00:32:10.928 --> 00:32:16.239
Caption: then I was like no no I made this page

00:32:12.369 --> 00:32:22.088
Caption: it&#39;s fine but it&#39;s like a box at the top

00:32:16.239 --> 00:32:23.440
Caption: you know it&#39;s scary you wax now the more

00:32:22.088 --> 00:32:25.629
Caption: semantic version already looks better

00:32:23.439 --> 00:32:27.638
Caption: it&#39;s got a cute dog o on it it&#39;s got the

00:32:25.629 --> 00:32:31.570
Caption: right title I can open it up in there

00:32:27.639 --> 00:32:37.690
Caption: reading up it looks pretty good they&#39;ve

00:32:31.569 --> 00:32:39.848
Caption: put their own styles in great also at

00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:41.978
Caption: the top it&#39;s got my name and the date

00:32:39.848 --> 00:32:47.468
Caption: much like Instapaper did and this is

00:32:41.979 --> 00:32:49.328
Caption: really really awesome when so the other

00:32:47.468 --> 00:32:51.338
Caption: one I looked at was Safari reading mode

00:32:49.328 --> 00:32:54.518
Caption: now this one&#39;s my favorite because in

00:32:51.338 --> 00:32:57.249
Caption: Safari it&#39;s there by default you click

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:58.389
Caption: the little lines next to the URL bar if

00:32:57.249 --> 00:32:59.809
Caption: it&#39;s not there there&#39;s something wrong

00:32:58.389 --> 00:33:01.609
Caption: with your page

00:32:59.808 --> 00:33:04.038
Caption: I&#39;ll be honest the dead version did not

00:33:01.609 --> 00:33:08.089
Caption: work I could not use Safari reading mode

00:33:04.038 --> 00:33:11.589
Caption: on it which was unfortunate but I could

00:33:08.089 --> 00:33:15.529
Caption: use my more semantic content however I

00:33:11.589 --> 00:33:17.989
Caption: didn&#39;t really work that well and kind of

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:19.760
Caption: mislead you a tiny bit pocket and

00:33:17.989 --> 00:33:23.288
Caption: Instapaper originally didn&#39;t put my name

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:25.729
Caption: and byline at the top of the page and

00:33:23.288 --> 00:33:29.719
Caption: safari reading mode was missing content

00:33:25.729 --> 00:33:33.199
Caption: there was no bullets no quotes no links

00:33:29.719 --> 00:33:35.530
Caption: further down and even paragraphs were

00:33:33.199 --> 00:33:37.969
Caption: missing and I was very very confused I

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:41.570
Caption: do not know what&#39;s going on and I

00:33:37.969 --> 00:33:43.579
Caption: panicked a little bit because the whole

00:33:41.569 --> 00:33:46.189
Caption: point of my presentation was that HTML

00:33:43.579 --> 00:33:48.019
Caption: and semantic hTML mattered and you know

00:33:46.189 --> 00:33:52.339
Caption: this is how technology consumes your

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:55.880
Caption: sites and I was like my life is a lie I

00:33:52.339 --> 00:34:00.439
Caption: don&#39;t know what to do HTML so a panicked

00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:02.298
Caption: big time and I went on Twitter as I do

00:34:00.439 --> 00:34:03.769
Caption: when I panic that&#39;s a mistake don&#39;t do

00:34:02.298 --> 00:34:06.139
Caption: that

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:07.549
Caption: and I realized I&#39;d made a really big

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.229
Caption: mistake I got in a bit of a Twitter

00:34:07.548 --> 00:34:12.829
Caption: conversation with someone about safaris

00:34:09.229 --> 00:34:15.858
Caption: reading mode and I forgotten about the

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:19.159
Caption: HTML attributes arguably the most

00:34:15.858 --> 00:34:20.839
Caption: powerful part of HTML there&#39;s not just

00:34:19.158 --> 00:34:22.368
Caption: elements in HTML they have a whole bunch

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.239
Caption: of attributes that you can use in order

00:34:22.368 --> 00:34:29.868
Caption: to provide more context and information

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:31.790
Caption: to your page so I went through this

00:34:29.868 --> 00:34:33.529
Caption: process of adding the right HTML

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:36.229
Caption: elements and then in Safari reader mode

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:37.850
Caption: I got a description I got my name and my

00:34:36.229 --> 00:34:41.600
Caption: byline at the top of the article and I

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:44.149
Caption: was like yes this works HTML it&#39;s not a

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:47.840
Caption: lie it&#39;s fantastic I don&#39;t have to

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:50.750
Caption: cancel my presentation huzzah

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.280
Caption: now before I tell you how I did that I&#39;m

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:54.878
Caption: gonna mention search because it is

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:58.609
Caption: related but we will get back to it now

00:34:54.878 --> 00:35:00.139
Caption: search they rely on like crawlers and

00:34:58.608 --> 00:35:02.419
Caption: BOTS that index your website&#39;s content

00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:04.159
Caption: and then it uses an algorithm to

00:35:02.419 --> 00:35:08.179
Caption: determine the relevance of the content

00:35:04.159 --> 00:35:09.770
Caption: to our search keywords now search engine

00:35:08.179 --> 00:35:11.520
Caption: crawlers behave a lot like screen

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:14.580
Caption: readers they can&#39;t at least

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:18.419
Caption: now intelligently understand audio-video

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:21.050
Caption: and imagery so they rely on text

00:35:18.419 --> 00:35:23.939
Caption: alternatives and well-written content to

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:26.729
Caption: kind of understand what the value of

00:35:23.939 --> 00:35:28.409
Caption: your pages and if you look at a Google

00:35:26.729 --> 00:35:32.100
Caption: result what it does is it takes the

00:35:28.409 --> 00:35:34.439
Caption: title element from your page and then it

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:36.630
Caption: takes the h1 and then h2 to provide an

00:35:34.439 --> 00:35:40.319
Caption: idea of what the content on the page is

00:35:36.629 --> 00:35:42.479
Caption: but when the pages HTML structure isn&#39;t

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:45.780
Caption: clear it can have a really negative

00:35:42.479 --> 00:35:48.810
Caption: impact on this also it can impact where

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:51.479
Caption: your search result appears on which page

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:54.270
Caption: in Google because it&#39;s much harder for

00:35:51.479 --> 00:35:55.830
Caption: the search engines to identify the type

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:58.350
Caption: of content that you might find on the

00:35:55.830 --> 00:36:00.450
Caption: page and the more information and

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:02.700
Caption: context that you give these spots and

00:36:00.449 --> 00:36:06.109
Caption: the crawlers the better they can match

00:36:02.699 --> 00:36:08.790
Caption: your content to relevant keywords so

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:10.410
Caption: keeping in mind the reading apps and

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:13.320
Caption: search engines and how search engines

00:36:10.409 --> 00:36:15.299
Caption: rely on more context and information to

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.449
Caption: match the keywords this brings me to

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.790
Caption: micro data now microdata is used to nest

00:36:18.449 --> 00:36:25.790
Caption: metadata on existing content in web

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:29.219
Caption: pages search engines web crawlers apps

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:31.739
Caption: assistive tech they all process metadata

00:36:29.219 --> 00:36:34.169
Caption: from a web page and use it to provide a

00:36:31.739 --> 00:36:38.459
Caption: richer browsing experience for users and

00:36:34.169 --> 00:36:40.679
Caption: in order to use it we can make use of

00:36:38.459 --> 00:36:42.899
Caption: something called schema.org now

00:36:40.679 --> 00:36:45.270
Caption: schema.org is a collection of

00:36:42.899 --> 00:36:47.279
Caption: vocabularies about various types of

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:48.840
Caption: content and there are a bunch of them

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.640
Caption: online this one&#39;s probably the most

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:55.920
Caption: popular and it is used by the major

00:36:50.639 --> 00:36:59.069
Caption: search engines and this allows other

00:36:55.919 --> 00:37:01.949
Caption: technologies to understand what our

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:05.040
Caption: content is and there are all types of

00:37:01.949 --> 00:37:08.339
Caption: vocabularies like person article

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:12.780
Caption: creative work publisher so on there

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:15.360
Caption: hates the websites pretty ugly but it&#39;s

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:17.780
Caption: worth checking out now in order to use

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:21.270
Caption: it we can use HTML attributes

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:23.119
Caption: specifically itemscope itemtype and atom

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:25.890
Caption: problem

00:37:23.118 --> 00:37:28.649
Caption: so I&#39;m going to show you how I got my

00:37:25.889 --> 00:37:32.098
Caption: name at the top of the reading apps by

00:37:28.649 --> 00:37:34.858
Caption: defining person as metadata on my page

00:37:32.099 --> 00:37:37.979
Caption: now the way that I did this was I have a

00:37:34.858 --> 00:37:40.798
Caption: paragraph and inside that I have by

00:37:37.979 --> 00:37:43.889
Caption: Mandy Michael and on the paragraph I add

00:37:40.799 --> 00:37:45.869
Caption: the item scope and what this does is it

00:37:43.889 --> 00:37:48.568
Caption: creates a new item and it says anything

00:37:45.868 --> 00:37:53.489
Caption: inside that paragraph is considered part

00:37:48.569 --> 00:37:57.208
Caption: of the scope of my item then I add the

00:37:53.489 --> 00:37:59.368
Caption: item type and I choose a vocabulary from

00:37:57.208 --> 00:38:02.608
Caption: schema.org in this case I went with

00:37:59.368 --> 00:38:05.788
Caption: person and what this does is it says

00:38:02.608 --> 00:38:08.879
Caption: this items context is about a person and

00:38:05.789 --> 00:38:11.039
Caption: it looks at the schema.org person&#39;s

00:38:08.879 --> 00:38:14.488
Caption: structure and it&#39;s like Google that&#39;s a

00:38:11.039 --> 00:38:17.309
Caption: person I know what to do with that now

00:38:14.489 --> 00:38:20.849
Caption: the last step is defining a child of

00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:23.009
Caption: that item so in this case I wanted to

00:38:20.849 --> 00:38:25.859
Caption: make myself up as the author so I

00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:28.650
Caption: wrapped my name in a span and I added

00:38:25.858 --> 00:38:30.479
Caption: the attribute of item prop and the value

00:38:28.649 --> 00:38:33.058
Caption: of that is author which is part of the

00:38:30.479 --> 00:38:38.489
Caption: person schema there are all sorts of

00:38:33.059 --> 00:38:40.880
Caption: things that you can do age gender if you

00:38:38.489 --> 00:38:46.829
Caption: want to what you&#39;re good at

00:38:40.879 --> 00:38:52.229
Caption: CSS padding dogs buying really amazing

00:38:46.829 --> 00:38:54.958
Caption: pets you know you can put all sorts of

00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:58.139
Caption: information around what a person does

00:38:54.958 --> 00:38:59.668
Caption: who they are and this helps to provide

00:38:58.139 --> 00:39:02.038
Caption: more content so if you searched from

00:38:59.668 --> 00:39:05.208
Caption: Andy Michael it would probably come up

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:08.698
Caption: with by our dogs why dogs a good article

00:39:05.208 --> 00:39:10.499
Caption: and this is really important because we

00:39:08.698 --> 00:39:12.448
Caption: have to remember that sometimes he HTML

00:39:10.499 --> 00:39:14.279
Caption: elements are not enough we need to

00:39:12.448 --> 00:39:16.889
Caption: provide additional context and

00:39:14.279 --> 00:39:20.249
Caption: information using metadata and other

00:39:16.889 --> 00:39:21.808
Caption: attributes because technology can&#39;t tell

00:39:20.249 --> 00:39:24.630
Caption: the difference between a paragraph with

00:39:21.809 --> 00:39:27.119
Caption: my name in it and a paragraph with some

00:39:24.629 --> 00:39:29.488
Caption: other random text from the page so we

00:39:27.118 --> 00:39:31.828
Caption: need to make our content more explicit

00:39:29.489 --> 00:39:33.958
Caption: and there are all sorts of HTML

00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:35.060
Caption: attributes that we can do use in order

00:39:33.958 --> 00:39:37.040
Caption: to do this

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.810
Caption: so Aria attributes are another really

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.780
Caption: good one that&#39;s used by assistive tech

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:44.510
Caption: you can use that to mark up the content

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:47.360
Caption: on your page to be more well understood

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:51.080
Caption: and provide more context for screen

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:54.110
Caption: readers so you can use Aria label on

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:56.750
Caption: your navigation element to say this is

00:39:54.110 --> 00:40:01.160
Caption: Manor or this is foot enough or related

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:04.219
Caption: links you can add a role of search on

00:40:01.159 --> 00:40:08.149
Caption: your inputs so that they know that it&#39;s

00:40:04.219 --> 00:40:11.719
Caption: such you can add a type of email on an

00:40:08.149 --> 00:40:14.629
Caption: input and say hey I expect an email in

00:40:11.719 --> 00:40:16.760
Caption: this this is all really useful and

00:40:14.629 --> 00:40:19.789
Caption: valuable context and information that we

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:24.100
Caption: can provide the browser and other

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:28.660
Caption: technologies with how to use our page

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:32.390
Caption: now I&#39;ve only really shown a very small

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:36.139
Caption: tiny example of different technology

00:40:32.389 --> 00:40:37.969
Caption: that tries to use our websites and how

00:40:36.139 --> 00:40:41.269
Caption: they try to consume and interpret and

00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:44.119
Caption: display our content and the impact that

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:46.969
Caption: HTML plays in making that work now there

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.890
Caption: are a lot of other browsers and aside

00:40:46.969 --> 00:40:50.149
Caption: from Chrome and Firefox there are a lot

00:40:48.889 --> 00:40:54.619
Caption: of search engines there are a lot of

00:40:50.149 --> 00:40:57.770
Caption: apps and they all are going to rely on

00:40:54.620 --> 00:41:01.130
Caption: that semantic HTML yesterday I was in in

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:02.479
Caption: Melbourne at code and Jason O&#39;Neil he&#39;s

00:41:01.129 --> 00:41:06.019
Caption: from Perth he did an amazing

00:41:02.479 --> 00:41:09.669
Caption: presentation on speech synthesis and how

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:14.120
Caption: important HTML was in order for

00:41:09.669 --> 00:41:18.079
Caption: technology to synthesize and use and

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:21.140
Caption: read and interpret content on our pages

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:24.140
Caption: using speech and I forget what the other

00:41:21.139 --> 00:41:26.869
Caption: one is called really really important

00:41:24.139 --> 00:41:29.389
Caption: and sound is only going to become more

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:31.520
Caption: valuable as people start trying to

00:41:29.389 --> 00:41:34.099
Caption: navigate their website by voice commands

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:37.040
Caption: like hey click on that or jump to that

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.690
Caption: heading if you don&#39;t use semantic hTML

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.739
Caption: you&#39;re not going to be able to do that

00:41:38.689 --> 00:41:42.469
Caption: and you&#39;re gonna have to do all that

00:41:39.739 --> 00:41:45.409
Caption: work again instead of just doing it from

00:41:42.469 --> 00:41:48.169
Caption: the start so what I&#39;m hoping is that

00:41:45.409 --> 00:41:48.578
Caption: when you start writing your website so

00:41:48.169 --> 00:41:52.778
Caption: you&#39;ll

00:41:48.579 --> 00:41:55.329
Caption: or even your tutorials and demos that

00:41:52.779 --> 00:41:56.739
Caption: you choose the right HTML element and

00:41:55.329 --> 00:41:59.468
Caption: attributes to best represent your

00:41:56.739 --> 00:42:01.359
Caption: content because whilst a lot of us

00:41:59.468 --> 00:42:03.819
Caption: probably have a good understanding of

00:42:01.358 --> 00:42:07.358
Caption: HTML there&#39;s new people starting every

00:42:03.819 --> 00:42:09.099
Caption: day in tact that don&#39;t know that and

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:12.909
Caption: it&#39;s our responsibility to make sure

00:42:09.099 --> 00:42:15.819
Caption: that they understand HTML value and that

00:42:12.909 --> 00:42:17.288
Caption: they use it properly otherwise we&#39;re

00:42:15.819 --> 00:42:20.218
Caption: letting them down and we&#39;re letting down

00:42:17.289 --> 00:42:23.678
Caption: anybody who tries to use our websites

00:42:20.218 --> 00:42:25.958
Caption: with not well written HTML

00:42:23.678 --> 00:42:29.049
Caption: and it&#39;s important to understand that

00:42:25.958 --> 00:42:30.759
Caption: hTML is not just the foundation that we

00:42:29.049 --> 00:42:32.349
Caption: build our websites on it&#39;s vital in

00:42:30.759 --> 00:42:35.559
Caption: making sure that our websites are

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:37.509
Caption: functional across different platforms

00:42:35.559 --> 00:42:42.429
Caption: and technologies and that they work as

00:42:37.509 --> 00:42:46.059
Caption: we expected them to because if you use

00:42:42.428 --> 00:42:48.578
Caption: HTML to its fullest from the beginning

00:42:46.059 --> 00:42:50.289
Caption: you&#39;re not just saving yourself a heap

00:42:48.579 --> 00:42:52.839
Caption: of time by making the most out of its

00:42:50.289 --> 00:42:54.849
Caption: built-in features you&#39;re making it more

00:42:52.839 --> 00:42:58.239
Caption: functional for people and for BOTS and

00:42:54.849 --> 00:43:00.549
Caption: for technology not just for now but

00:42:58.239 --> 00:43:02.468
Caption: whatever comes in the future and

00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:06.420
Caption: yesterday when I was at code

00:43:02.468 --> 00:43:09.968
Caption: I said HTML is kind of like that friend

00:43:06.419 --> 00:43:12.818
Caption: that was really really good to you and

00:43:09.968 --> 00:43:16.419
Caption: did heaps for you and then one day they

00:43:12.819 --> 00:43:19.869
Caption: were like you don&#39;t care about me you

00:43:16.419 --> 00:43:24.548
Caption: don&#39;t appreciate me and they leave and

00:43:19.868 --> 00:43:26.288
Caption: then you&#39;re like oh you did so much
