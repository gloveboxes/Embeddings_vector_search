Caption: Watson he&#39;s going to talk to us today

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.819
Caption: about releasing your inner Dev Ops Dylan

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.520
Caption: is a fan of cheap wine and fast

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:26.100
Caption: deployments he has spent the last five

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.979
Caption: years improving the pace of development

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.840
Caption: at Bankwest and has recently started

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.819
Caption: with atlassian building out their

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.040
Caption: internal continuous deployment platform

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:37.860
Caption: when he&#39;s not building out the latest

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.779
Caption: hair brain app idea he is playing on the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.620
Caption: trampoline with his two kids welcome

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:42.619
Caption: Dylan

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:47.238
Caption: foreign

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.919
Caption: welcome guys uh so

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:58.099
Caption: basically today I want to talk about how

00:00:55.919 --> 00:01:02.538
Caption: to build a culture of getting your code

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:05.639
Caption: uh into production quickly safely uh and

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.360
Caption: uh reliably

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:12.599
Caption: hey thanks heaps uh all our sponsors

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.299
Caption: um they&#39;ve yeah without this without

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:18.118
Caption: them today you know wouldn&#39;t be possible

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.280
Caption: okay so first I want to start off with a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.900
Caption: bit of audience participation everyone

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:26.658
Caption: loves the middle audience participation

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.659
Caption: I&#39;m sure uh so oh no

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.400
Caption: okay try not to touch okay so

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:37.199
Caption: if everyone could put up their hand if

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.700
Caption: your team has deployed something to

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:42.978
Caption: production this year

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:42.978
Caption: we&#39;ll start ideally a low bar

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:50.219
Caption: so keep your hand up so keep your hand

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.839
Caption: up if you your team deploys more often

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.220
Caption: than every six months

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:58.438
Caption: cool all right uh what about every month

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.959
Caption: okay a few few hands down but still

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.880
Caption: pretty good okay every week do you does

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:06.779
Caption: your team deploy every week

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:09.720
Caption: yep few less hands what about every day

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:13.520
Caption: yep much much less hands

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.520
Caption: and what about every commit

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:19.259
Caption: okay cool there&#39;s there&#39;s a few people

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.620
Caption: uh awesome uh for the rest of you

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:24.000
Caption: it&#39;s definitely possible right uh and

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:26.759
Caption: today I&#39;m going to show you a few

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.440
Caption: techniques that you can use uh maybe not

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:32.000
Caption: necessarily to get there but to improve

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.000
Caption: your deployment process okay

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.080
Caption: uh

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.479
Caption: I&#39;m Dylan Watson I love building useful

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.720
Caption: software and thinking about better ways

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:44.458
Caption: to get it into the hands of our users

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.860
Caption: so first of all I&#39;m going to start off

00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:49.979
Caption: with some guiding principles things to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.639
Caption: think about in improving your uh

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:56.159
Caption: path to prod a little case study recent

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:59.000
Caption: project I&#39;ve been working on and some

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.040
Caption: practical techniques that you can use to

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.199
Caption: move your code into users hands quickly

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:06.899
Caption: and safely

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:08.580
Caption: uh hopefully there&#39;s time for questions

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:10.378
Caption: at the end so

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.119
Caption: um I am definitely Keen to get into some

00:03:10.378 --> 00:03:15.679
Caption: discussion if you guys

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:15.679
Caption: um have got uh thoughts

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:19.800
Caption: there&#39;s going to be some controversial

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.679
Caption: stuff ahead uh you won&#39;t agree with

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.199
Caption: everything I&#39;m sure but that&#39;s cool uh

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:28.799
Caption: as I said we can have a chat afterwards

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:32.220
Caption: um I will be Keen to have a discussion

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.040
Caption: so first off deploying safe uh deploying

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.080
Caption: software safely uh it can be hard

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:38.639
Caption: hopefully that isn&#39;t the controversial

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.759
Caption: wit

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:43.259
Caption: I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all experienced pain in

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:46.199
Caption: deploying software

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:48.319
Caption: uh but it doesn&#39;t have to be that way

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:51.179
Caption: so

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.819
Caption: I&#39;m sure that we&#39;ve all got a time when

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:56.158
Caption: uh we&#39;ve had a painful deployment to

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.720
Caption: Pride maybe a late night or something so

00:03:56.158 --> 00:03:59.580
Caption: I want you to think about what makes

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.319
Caption: deployments hard

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.419
Caption: um

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.098
Caption: does does anyone have anything that they

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.860
Caption: think like what what makes a deployment

00:04:05.098 --> 00:04:10.619
Caption: hard anyone have any ideas

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.298
Caption: feel free to shout out

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:18.298
Caption: oh yes late night deployments

00:04:14.298 --> 00:04:20.160
Caption: gotta love them anything else

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.180
Caption: oh testing

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.580
Caption: yes so manual testing uh is a huge one

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:29.660
Caption: for sure yep

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:29.659
Caption: um any anything else

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.520
Caption: cabs yes okay so approvals and stuff

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.220
Caption: like that that&#39;s a huge one so things I

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:41.339
Caption: think about uh might be coordination

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.979
Caption: between multiple teams okay getting

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:46.100
Caption: getting people to align is always really

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.720
Caption: difficult scheduling out of hours

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.100
Caption: deployments I&#39;d rather be at home with

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.259
Caption: my family

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.779
Caption: um batching weeks and weeks of changes

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.959
Caption: is super scary you have no idea what

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:59.820
Caption: you&#39;re sending into production okay

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:01.579
Caption: manual deployment so any any manual

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.100
Caption: steps in your process to production

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:07.978
Caption: really uh that can make things really

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.479
Caption: scary they&#39;re likely to go wrong

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.519
Caption: um you&#39;re going to mess something up no

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.160
Caption: matter how many times you&#39;ve done it

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:14.819
Caption: and manual testing

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.739
Caption: um

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.240
Caption: discuss this as well it&#39;s it&#39;s Error

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:19.739
Caption: prone okay you want everything to be

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:21.299
Caption: automated in your pipeline as much as

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:23.220
Caption: possible

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:25.019
Caption: and once you actually get the thing into

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.399
Caption: production if something goes wrong and

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:29.279
Caption: you can&#39;t roll back to a safe State

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:31.739
Caption: easily that&#39;s also really scary right so

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.899
Caption: all these things build up this fear in

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:36.660
Caption: our deployment process

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:38.880
Caption: hey on the other side of the coin what

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.320
Caption: makes deployments easy

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.320
Caption: does anyone have any ideas

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.199
Caption: sorry

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.059
Caption: yes yeah so let&#39;s uh less changes going

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.220
Caption: into production right

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:55.199
Caption: um things like having your code always

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.839
Caption: ready to deploy

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.639
Caption: um so you&#39;ve actually made all the you

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:01.979
Caption: know automated checks before you get to

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:07.020
Caption: production before you even merged your

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:07.919
Caption: code uh no approvals no coordination

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:12.359
Caption: um

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.559
Caption: yes uh automated everything basically is

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:14.638
Caption: probably going to be the pattern of this

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:18.259
Caption: talk

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:22.020
Caption: um but yeah manual steps testing or

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:23.639
Caption: approvals for sure and you want to get

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:24.899
Caption: to a point where your deployments rarely

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.559
Caption: fail

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:31.739
Caption: um but most of that is about uh is about

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:34.139
Caption: practice and automation

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:36.059
Caption: uh

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.819
Caption: so how do we do it

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:41.819
Caption: okay these are the things that I I think

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.380
Caption: are a key uh when we&#39;re improving our

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.419
Caption: deployment process

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.660
Caption: so

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:51.720
Caption: first of all uh we&#39;ll start off with

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:55.380
Caption: uh I mean my talks releasing the devops

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:58.079
Caption: right so devops is really a mindset a

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.839
Caption: mindset about automating or removing the

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:03.899
Caption: steps in your process of deploying prod

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:05.759
Caption: to production and

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:07.220
Caption: being prepared to fail right so you&#39;re

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:10.500
Caption: trying things out

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.419
Caption: and uh experimenting with your

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.199
Caption: deployment process and trying to just

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:15.199
Caption: improve it

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:20.160
Caption: uh back to fundamentals basically what

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.660
Caption: we&#39;re trying to do is write code deploy

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.459
Caption: it to production get it in into the

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.039
Caption: hands of our users right that&#39;s that&#39;s

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:28.319
Caption: ultimately what we&#39;re doing here

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:30.959
Caption: so

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:32.039
Caption: we discussed before a small number of

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:34.319
Caption: changes

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:37.860
Caption: less risk right so smaller change you

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:40.440
Caption: make uh you might have uh less risk of

00:07:37.859 --> 00:07:43.019
Caption: that failing but also when it does fail

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.179
Caption: when uh

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:46.500
Caption: you know exactly what broke right you

00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:48.660
Caption: know that one little change you made

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:52.259
Caption: that was the issue you can roll it back

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:55.139
Caption: fix it okay it&#39;s it&#39;s isolated

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:56.519
Caption: uh you should only merge when it&#39;s safe

00:07:55.139 --> 00:08:01.380
Caption: for production

00:07:56.519 --> 00:08:04.379
Caption: so uh this is more of a yeah again this

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.179
Caption: is like a mindset thing uh and in order

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.459
Caption: to check that we&#39;ll we&#39;ll go through the

00:08:06.179 --> 00:08:10.979
Caption: techniques and stuff but we want to

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:15.239
Caption: merge and have all the automated safety

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:16.380
Caption: uh and know that um it this thing is as

00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:19.440
Caption: safe as possible to go to production

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:21.720
Caption: before you even merge that code

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.639
Caption: uh testing is built into the pipeline

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.559
Caption: okay that&#39;s absolutely critical so

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:27.960
Caption: automated testing

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:29.220
Caption: um and there&#39;s you know I could do a

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:31.199
Caption: whole another talk about the types of

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.500
Caption: testing but testing has to be built into

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:38.700
Caption: the pipeline uh same with security okay

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:41.218
Caption: so uh it&#39;s that&#39;s just another aspect

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.380
Caption: that we have to consider when we&#39;re

00:08:41.218 --> 00:08:45.719
Caption: um so so this is like your you know code

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.580
Caption: code scanning or vulnerability checking

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:49.259
Caption: all this sort of stuff needs to be

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:53.000
Caption: automated and will stop you from going

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.000
Caption: to production if these things break

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.600
Caption: um and lastly once you actually get your

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:59.039
Caption: code into production you need to observe

00:08:57.599 --> 00:09:01.679
Caption: what&#39;s happening right you need to know

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:03.719
Caption: so this is like you&#39;re logging so

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:05.880
Caption: um logging or

00:09:03.719 --> 00:09:07.619
Caption: uh metrics and all this sort of stuff

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.059
Caption: you need to know exactly what&#39;s going on

00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:11.458
Caption: in production so that when things do

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:12.419
Caption: break you can easily track down the

00:09:11.458 --> 00:09:14.278
Caption: issue

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:16.919
Caption: and that you know that something is

00:09:14.278 --> 00:09:18.719
Caption: broken in the first place

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:20.039
Caption: okay so

00:09:18.719 --> 00:09:22.500
Caption: um I just want to chat a little bit

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:28.500
Caption: about recent project I&#39;ve been working

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:30.919
Caption: on uh at Bankwest uh so this is a home

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.940
Caption: loan system with

00:09:30.919 --> 00:09:36.619
Caption: depending how you cut the numbers about

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:40.320
Caption: 20 different components so apis and apps

00:09:36.619 --> 00:09:41.940
Caption: and around about four teams

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.359
Caption: so

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:47.580
Caption: when we sort of started our devops

00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:51.599
Caption: journey uh we&#39;re making about five

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:53.640
Caption: deployments per month okay uh which is

00:09:51.599 --> 00:09:56.639
Caption: is still not terrible but there&#39;s

00:09:53.640 --> 00:10:00.660
Caption: there&#39;s also a few teams involved there

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:02.760
Caption: um and we increased to 55 deployments

00:10:00.659 --> 00:10:04.559
Caption: about that around about

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.278
Caption: so

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:07.979
Caption: um

00:10:05.278 --> 00:10:09.898
Caption: on a global scale that&#39;s that&#39;s not a

00:10:07.979 --> 00:10:11.458
Caption: huge amount but it but it made a big

00:10:09.898 --> 00:10:12.599
Caption: difference to us right

00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:13.919
Caption: um that&#39;s the order of magnitude

00:10:12.599 --> 00:10:15.719
Caption: difference

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:18.599
Caption: um so how

00:10:15.719 --> 00:10:21.958
Caption: how do we do that right

00:10:18.599 --> 00:10:24.059
Caption: we were prepared to fail often okay try

00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:27.000
Caption: things out uh we would have the

00:10:24.059 --> 00:10:31.260
Caption: engineers in control of deployments and

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.559
Caption: our definition of done was in production

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:37.320
Caption: so yeah so experimenting and failing

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:39.299
Caption: often we made failure okay and even

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.440
Caption: expected often when we&#39;re trying things

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:42.659
Caption: out

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.898
Caption: um and because of this we tried lots of

00:10:42.659 --> 00:10:47.398
Caption: things failure was cheap okay but we

00:10:45.898 --> 00:10:49.320
Caption: also had the backing from our managers

00:10:47.398 --> 00:10:51.260
Caption: to push and improve and make these

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.940
Caption: changes and

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.919
Caption: the expectation is that most of these

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.179
Caption: experiments experiments failed but the

00:10:55.919 --> 00:11:00.320
Caption: ones that worked

00:10:57.179 --> 00:11:00.320
Caption: they had a big impact

00:11:00.599 --> 00:11:04.259
Caption: okay

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:05.940
Caption: um another so I think probably the

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.640
Caption: biggest one for me is that the engineers

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:11.820
Caption: uh were in control of the deployments so

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.239
Caption: uh when we started uh the people doing

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.260
Caption: deployments uh the Ops were a totally

00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:18.958
Caption: different team

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.940
Caption: right they um they sat over there and

00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.078
Caption: you would say oh I want I want a

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.078
Caption: deployment please and you&#39;d have to

00:11:22.078 --> 00:11:27.599
Caption: schedule it in and uh in order to

00:11:25.078 --> 00:11:31.078
Caption: alleviate a lot of the pressure

00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:33.000
Caption: um we we brought that person in so we

00:11:31.078 --> 00:11:35.039
Caption: brought one of those Ops people into our

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.479
Caption: team okay and that made a huge

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:39.000
Caption: difference for us

00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:41.099
Caption: um because it meant that uh all the

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.200
Caption: people in the team we had all the all

00:11:41.099 --> 00:11:45.659
Caption: the skills in the team to deploy our

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.600
Caption: code to production

00:11:45.659 --> 00:11:50.518
Caption: um from there that person trained the

00:11:48.599 --> 00:11:53.338
Caption: rest of the team and we were able to

00:11:50.518 --> 00:11:57.539
Caption: work together Engineers uh that like Dev

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:59.940
Caption: anops to essentially automate our

00:11:57.539 --> 00:12:01.440
Caption: pipeline to production

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.440
Caption: uh

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:09.018
Caption: so uh to a point where anyone in the

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.018
Caption: team could you know just click a button

00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:13.500
Caption: so

00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:15.659
Caption: um yeah essentially the what&#39;s pretty

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.500
Caption: common now the the Builder you build it

00:12:15.659 --> 00:12:18.500
Caption: you run it concept

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.059
Caption: and

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.320
Caption: lastly I think the fact that our

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:27.179
Caption: definition of done is in production

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.220
Caption: right so you you can&#39;t close the ticket

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:32.099
Caption: that you&#39;re working on until that thing

00:12:29.219 --> 00:12:33.179
Caption: is in the hands of your users and I

00:12:32.099 --> 00:12:35.398
Caption: think

00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:38.458
Caption: um maybe it&#39;s a maybe it&#39;s a guilt thing

00:12:35.398 --> 00:12:40.140
Caption: but I think that&#39;s a it&#39;s a or even just

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:42.419
Caption: a visibility thing

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.940
Caption: um if if you don&#39;t close that particular

00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:47.278
Caption: task until it&#39;s in production it doesn&#39;t

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.559
Caption: get forgotten about and you know that

00:12:47.278 --> 00:12:52.859
Caption: when things start when Cards start to

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:54.539
Caption: you know pile up uh there&#39;s sort of a

00:12:52.859 --> 00:12:55.679
Caption: you can feel it here that like you need

00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:57.000
Caption: to get that into production that&#39;s

00:12:55.679 --> 00:13:00.078
Caption: that&#39;s a whole bunch of features that

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.078
Caption: your users are missing out on

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:07.200
Caption: okay so now I want to share some

00:13:04.138 --> 00:13:10.440
Caption: techniques oh uh I now want to share

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.898
Caption: some techniques uh that help to deploy

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:15.619
Caption: regularly and safely

00:13:12.898 --> 00:13:15.619
Caption: so

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:22.138
Caption: first of all uh we want to separate our

00:13:19.619 --> 00:13:25.138
Caption: deployments and our releases

00:13:22.138 --> 00:13:28.440
Caption: uh we want to use feature toggles

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:30.479
Caption: and a little thing called expand roll

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.398
Caption: out contract

00:13:30.479 --> 00:13:33.958
Caption: um which is a really great technique

00:13:32.398 --> 00:13:36.119
Caption: some of you probably have used it

00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.260
Caption: without knowing the name uh but

00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:40.380
Caption: basically all these things are about

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:43.639
Caption: taking a considered measured approach

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.638
Caption: okay to our deployments

00:13:44.398 --> 00:13:49.500
Caption: so yeah deployments and releases so

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:52.200
Caption: first of all

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:55.500
Caption: uh more audience participation

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:58.859
Caption: uh who who dreads deployments

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.679
Caption: I I suspect anyone that deploys more of

00:13:58.859 --> 00:14:03.719
Caption: less less often than a month probably is

00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:04.380
Caption: having these thoughts

00:14:03.719 --> 00:14:06.479
Caption: um

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.338
Caption: okay and what about who who dreads

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:13.320
Caption: releases

00:14:08.338 --> 00:14:16.278
Caption: who have a little think now who thinks I

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.278
Caption: asked the same question twice

00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:23.398
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s valid okay

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:25.078
Caption: um but uh basically I I&#39;m here to

00:14:23.398 --> 00:14:27.359
Caption: basically separate those two concepts

00:14:25.078 --> 00:14:30.299
Caption: okay so first of all we&#39;ll start with

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:31.739
Caption: some some definitions so deployments are

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:32.338
Caption: basically

00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:34.739
Caption: um

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:36.719
Caption: in my eyes moving your code into a

00:14:34.739 --> 00:14:39.479
Caption: production environment

00:14:36.719 --> 00:14:40.739
Caption: okay ideally there&#39;s zero downtime so

00:14:39.479 --> 00:14:42.539
Caption: you&#39;re using some sort of deployment

00:14:40.739 --> 00:14:44.159
Caption: strategy like

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:47.219
Caption: um green blue deploy or something like

00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:49.159
Caption: that but ultimately there is no there is

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:52.679
Caption: no downtime in your system

00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:54.359
Caption: and it should be a low risk to the

00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:58.078
Caption: business it&#39;s a technical exercise we&#39;re

00:14:54.359 --> 00:14:59.638
Caption: just moving some code into a production

00:14:58.078 --> 00:15:00.619
Caption: environment

00:14:59.638 --> 00:15:03.359
Caption: okay

00:15:00.619 --> 00:15:06.479
Caption: and with automation it should happen

00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:09.479
Caption: with minimal human interaction

00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:12.320
Caption: um uh it also shouldn&#39;t be affecting our

00:15:09.479 --> 00:15:15.359
Caption: users is a pretty cool pretty cool

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.859
Caption: pretty critical one there&#39;s zero time

00:15:15.359 --> 00:15:19.320
Caption: downtime but there shouldn&#39;t really be

00:15:16.859 --> 00:15:21.659
Caption: any impact to our users

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.380
Caption: on a release on the other hand

00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:26.940
Caption: um

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:29.099
Caption: now obviously we had some people that uh

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.720
Caption: uh you know thought I was asking the

00:15:29.099 --> 00:15:32.698
Caption: same question really deployments and

00:15:30.719 --> 00:15:34.198
Caption: releases that&#39;s like they&#39;re pretty

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:36.119
Caption: ambiguous terms I think I think release

00:15:34.198 --> 00:15:37.799
Caption: is a pretty ambiguous term um it&#39;s used

00:15:36.119 --> 00:15:38.458
Caption: for all sorts of things

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:40.260
Caption: um

00:15:38.458 --> 00:15:41.898
Caption: generally I&#39;ll probably use the word

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:45.720
Caption: launch right

00:15:41.898 --> 00:15:47.338
Caption: so I&#39;ll go I&#39;ll go through in a sec but

00:15:45.719 --> 00:15:49.379
Caption: uh

00:15:47.338 --> 00:15:53.059
Caption: a release or a launch is basically about

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.059
Caption: launching new functionality to a user

00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:58.679
Caption: um and maybe maybe you&#39;re only launching

00:15:55.799 --> 00:16:00.599
Caption: to some set of users right you&#39;re only

00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:02.099
Caption: activating the code for for certain

00:16:00.599 --> 00:16:04.578
Caption: users

00:16:02.099 --> 00:16:07.198
Caption: um and the fact that we&#39;re separating

00:16:04.578 --> 00:16:10.500
Caption: deployments and releases allows us to

00:16:07.198 --> 00:16:12.239
Caption: prepare prepare time for comms or train

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.739
Caption: our users or let them know that

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:16.398
Caption: something is something new is coming

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:18.838
Caption: okay it&#39;s not going to be like a

00:16:16.398 --> 00:16:21.599
Caption: new Facebook release and everyone goes

00:16:18.838 --> 00:16:22.500
Caption: oh it&#39;s totally changed okay

00:16:21.599 --> 00:16:24.179
Caption: um we don&#39;t want to end up in that

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.739
Caption: situation

00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:27.239
Caption: um okay so who cares

00:16:25.739 --> 00:16:28.919
Caption: deployments

00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:30.778
Caption: the team should care right the team

00:16:28.919 --> 00:16:33.239
Caption: doing the work is sending that code into

00:16:30.778 --> 00:16:34.260
Caption: production and and they care when things

00:16:33.239 --> 00:16:35.638
Caption: break

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.440
Caption: okay releases

00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:38.758
Caption: we&#39;re trying to

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.380
Caption: um we&#39;re trying to give the user new

00:16:38.758 --> 00:16:42.000
Caption: functionality so the user should care

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.979
Caption: okay

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.239
Caption: um and I think that

00:16:43.979 --> 00:16:46.679
Caption: that&#39;s what we should be thinking about

00:16:45.239 --> 00:16:48.539
Caption: when we&#39;re separating things okay so

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:49.559
Caption: anyway how do we separate these two

00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:52.380
Caption: things

00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:53.940
Caption: basically we&#39;re trying to deploy a bunch

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.099
Caption: of times

00:16:53.940 --> 00:17:00.179
Caption: um

00:16:55.099 --> 00:17:01.979
Caption: uh and eventually release

00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:04.859
Caption: so

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:06.599
Caption: okay uh basically

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:08.640
Caption: uh

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:10.260
Caption: uh the there&#39;s a bunch of different ways

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.938
Caption: you can do it but the biggest one

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.160
Caption: um I&#39;m sure a bunch of you will know

00:17:11.938 --> 00:17:16.640
Caption: feature toggles are the way to do this

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.640
Caption: okay

00:17:16.678 --> 00:17:20.938
Caption: so

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.619
Caption: for those unsure this is a feature

00:17:20.938 --> 00:17:25.078
Caption: toggle okay it&#39;s essentially just

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:28.318
Caption: something wrapping our code

00:17:25.078 --> 00:17:30.239
Caption: um a you know an if block that says if

00:17:28.318 --> 00:17:32.219
Caption: this new new feature is on for some

00:17:30.239 --> 00:17:34.079
Caption: specific user

00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:36.418
Caption: um and you know this thing could be

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:39.719
Caption: tight entirely broken underneath

00:17:36.418 --> 00:17:41.819
Caption: ideally it&#39;s not but um the the block

00:17:39.719 --> 00:17:43.380
Caption: allows us to test

00:17:41.819 --> 00:17:45.298
Caption: um test this out test out this new

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:48.979
Caption: feature

00:17:45.298 --> 00:17:48.979
Caption: without affecting other users

00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:54.418
Caption: so with feed toggles we can deploy our

00:17:53.099 --> 00:17:57.000
Caption: changes

00:17:54.418 --> 00:17:59.339
Caption: um and they will be inactive okay so

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.380
Caption: they won&#39;t affect our users

00:17:59.339 --> 00:18:05.640
Caption: they can be slowly rolled out to certain

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:08.699
Caption: users and basically they allow features

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.099
Caption: to be merged and you know built out

00:18:08.699 --> 00:18:13.019
Caption: without affecting other teams as well so

00:18:11.099 --> 00:18:14.418
Caption: other teams working in the same on the

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:19.739
Caption: same component in the same area

00:18:14.418 --> 00:18:23.058
Caption: unaffected by your your work okay your

00:18:19.739 --> 00:18:26.280
Caption: potentially broken new feature

00:18:23.058 --> 00:18:27.719
Caption: uh the other dark side of this to

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.739
Caption: toggles

00:18:27.719 --> 00:18:33.359
Caption: um some of you might have heard about

00:18:28.739 --> 00:18:36.058
Caption: the uh night Capital recently

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:40.558
Caption: um that basically didn&#39;t forgot to clean

00:18:36.058 --> 00:18:42.779
Caption: up a particular toggle and they reused

00:18:40.558 --> 00:18:44.819
Caption: the same toggle name and it causes

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:48.059
Caption: caused them to lose millions of dollars

00:18:44.819 --> 00:18:49.798
Caption: so the critical part of using feature

00:18:48.058 --> 00:18:54.779
Caption: toggles is to clean them up afterwards

00:18:49.798 --> 00:18:58.558
Caption: okay so my rule of thumb is uh basically

00:18:54.780 --> 00:19:01.380
Caption: once it&#39;s on and you&#39;ve proven that it&#39;s

00:18:58.558 --> 00:19:03.719
Caption: uh that it&#39;s not going to break uh you

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.579
Caption: then remove it right it sounds obvious

00:19:03.719 --> 00:19:08.520
Caption: but it&#39;s it&#39;s something that it&#39;s often

00:19:05.579 --> 00:19:11.699
Caption: gets forgotten about but once you turn

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.739
Caption: it on you remove it okay maybe a week or

00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:16.019
Caption: whatever but you remove it almost

00:19:13.739 --> 00:19:19.260
Caption: straight away

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:22.320
Caption: um so in terms of the process we might

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:24.780
Caption: introduce a new feature with you know if

00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:27.779
Caption: this new feature is on for some internal

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:29.039
Caption: user so we turn it on for internal users

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.719
Caption: to begin with

00:19:29.038 --> 00:19:32.279
Caption: and

00:19:30.719 --> 00:19:34.558
Caption: um we can start building out this

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.859
Caption: feature so we add some more new shiny

00:19:34.558 --> 00:19:40.678
Caption: feature maybe a bug fix okay because our

00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:41.660
Caption: users have been using it our internal

00:19:40.678 --> 00:19:44.038
Caption: users

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:46.559
Caption: we&#39;ve been you know dog fooding this

00:19:44.038 --> 00:19:50.219
Caption: this particular feature and uh we fix

00:19:46.558 --> 00:19:52.500
Caption: some bugs okay after that we start

00:19:50.219 --> 00:19:54.900
Caption: turning it on for some specific set of

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:57.839
Caption: customers okay

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:59.700
Caption: and you know maybe we make a a few more

00:19:57.839 --> 00:20:01.739
Caption: bug fixes but we&#39;re only affecting a

00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:03.058
Caption: small subset of users

00:20:01.739 --> 00:20:04.020
Caption: and then finally we turn it on for

00:20:03.058 --> 00:20:06.719
Caption: everyone

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:08.959
Caption: okay as soon as that happens

00:20:06.719 --> 00:20:12.780
Caption: we remove the code remove the Feature

00:20:08.959 --> 00:20:15.798
Caption: Feature toggle and everyone has the

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.799
Caption: shiny new feature

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.520
Caption: so

00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:22.199
Caption: um okay so that&#39;s about introducing new

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.558
Caption: functionality

00:20:22.199 --> 00:20:28.678
Caption: when we want to introduce

00:20:24.558 --> 00:20:31.199
Caption: say a new

00:20:28.678 --> 00:20:33.659
Caption: um a new field or a new endpoint for our

00:20:31.199 --> 00:20:36.599
Caption: for our API we use a technique called

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.979
Caption: expand rollout contract okay this allows

00:20:36.599 --> 00:20:39.199
Caption: us to make

00:20:37.979 --> 00:20:41.119
Caption: um

00:20:39.199 --> 00:20:44.399
Caption: uh

00:20:41.119 --> 00:20:47.178
Caption: basically breaking changes in a um in a

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.179
Caption: considered manner

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.739
Caption: so um expand roll out contract I&#39;ll go

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.579
Caption: through it in a sec so

00:20:52.739 --> 00:20:57.178
Caption: um

00:20:53.579 --> 00:21:00.058
Caption: some more code hopefully it&#39;s simple

00:20:57.178 --> 00:21:04.079
Caption: enough uh but basically we&#39;ve got a user

00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:06.479
Caption: they&#39;ve got a name field a surname field

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:09.979
Caption: and some usage of that field

00:21:06.479 --> 00:21:13.319
Caption: so we think well actually the name field

00:21:09.979 --> 00:21:14.579
Caption: really should be first name okay we want

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:18.298
Caption: to rename this field

00:21:14.579 --> 00:21:21.359
Caption: so the first thing to do is we expand

00:21:18.298 --> 00:21:23.279
Caption: okay so we add our first name field

00:21:21.359 --> 00:21:25.380
Caption: uh

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.219
Caption: no one really uses it we&#39;ve added the

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.660
Caption: field

00:21:26.219 --> 00:21:29.659
Caption: we deploy that to prod

00:21:29.699 --> 00:21:34.739
Caption: and then we want to start we&#39;ve got this

00:21:32.579 --> 00:21:36.479
Caption: new field we want to start using it so

00:21:34.739 --> 00:21:37.918
Caption: we make a change

00:21:36.479 --> 00:21:42.058
Caption: we start everyone starts to use this

00:21:37.918 --> 00:21:43.558
Caption: field okay there might be if it&#39;s an API

00:21:42.058 --> 00:21:45.239
Caption: there might be multiple other apis

00:21:43.558 --> 00:21:48.359
Caption: consuming this particular field okay

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:51.119
Caption: everyone updates to use this new field

00:21:48.359 --> 00:21:53.640
Caption: we deploy the prod

00:21:51.119 --> 00:21:55.798
Caption: after that uh

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.780
Caption: so that&#39;s so that&#39;s rolling out your

00:21:55.798 --> 00:22:02.038
Caption: change right after that you want to

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:04.080
Caption: start to contract so once you&#39;ve proven

00:22:02.038 --> 00:22:06.178
Caption: proven that everyone has stopped using

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:08.760
Caption: that particular field

00:22:06.178 --> 00:22:12.719
Caption: you then contract and you remove the now

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:14.820
Caption: defunct unused field okay so this is a

00:22:12.719 --> 00:22:16.918
Caption: measured form of deprecating a

00:22:14.819 --> 00:22:19.380
Caption: particular field

00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:24.178
Caption: so we remove our name field that&#39;s no

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:27.479
Caption: longer used and we go about our lives

00:22:24.178 --> 00:22:30.479
Caption: after deploying right

00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:33.538
Caption: so yeah expand roll out contract so this

00:22:30.479 --> 00:22:35.939
Caption: technique is really useful for API

00:22:33.538 --> 00:22:38.459
Caption: changes okay it might be Fields might be

00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:40.199
Caption: endpoints but it&#39;s also really useful

00:22:38.459 --> 00:22:42.658
Caption: for database changes you can do the same

00:22:40.199 --> 00:22:46.139
Caption: thing and

00:22:42.659 --> 00:22:48.659
Caption: uh like Library changes Library changes

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:51.419
Caption: potentially uh

00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:54.539
Caption: a bit harder to track down usages but

00:22:51.418 --> 00:22:56.279
Caption: um uh yeah if if you can if you can

00:22:54.538 --> 00:22:59.279
Caption: understand your users of your library

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.419
Caption: then this works just perfectly

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.460
Caption: um

00:23:00.418 --> 00:23:04.319
Caption: okay obviously

00:23:02.459 --> 00:23:06.538
Caption: always deploy the problem

00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:09.599
Caption: so

00:23:06.538 --> 00:23:13.339
Caption: what given everything now uh what is an

00:23:09.599 --> 00:23:13.339
Caption: ideal deploy process look like

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:16.619
Caption: um

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:20.599
Caption: so we&#39;ve got

00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:20.599
Caption: automated tests and security scanning

00:23:21.959 --> 00:23:28.140
Caption: we&#39;ve got an automated deployment

00:23:24.239 --> 00:23:29.219
Caption: process okay and it&#39;s really quick to

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.260
Caption: roll back

00:23:29.219 --> 00:23:34.219
Caption: and really quick to get you back into a

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:37.678
Caption: safe State when things go wrong

00:23:34.219 --> 00:23:40.199
Caption: uh our changes are toggled so when we

00:23:37.678 --> 00:23:42.119
Caption: deploy them they have no user impact

00:23:40.199 --> 00:23:44.099
Caption: initially until we&#39;re ready okay until

00:23:42.119 --> 00:23:46.380
Caption: our users are ready until we&#39;ve tested

00:23:44.099 --> 00:23:48.599
Caption: that feature and we&#39;re happy

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:51.000
Caption: and that means that we minimize the

00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:53.579
Caption: number of approvals required after

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.079
Caption: you&#39;ve merged your code you can have as

00:23:53.579 --> 00:23:57.298
Caption: much process as you want before you

00:23:55.079 --> 00:23:59.819
Caption: merge your code as much as you need but

00:23:57.298 --> 00:24:01.699
Caption: ideally after you&#39;ve merged that code it

00:23:59.819 --> 00:24:03.619
Caption: should be ready to go to production

00:24:01.699 --> 00:24:06.479
Caption: and uh

00:24:03.619 --> 00:24:08.339
Caption: it&#39;s all automated and our changes are

00:24:06.479 --> 00:24:11.298
Caption: backwards compatible okay we&#39;re using

00:24:08.339 --> 00:24:15.058
Caption: expand expand rollout contract

00:24:11.298 --> 00:24:16.979
Caption: or some features toggling mechanism and

00:24:15.058 --> 00:24:18.599
Caption: so we minimize the coordination that we

00:24:16.979 --> 00:24:20.339
Caption: need between teams

00:24:18.599 --> 00:24:21.780
Caption: uh because we&#39;re not breaking other

00:24:20.339 --> 00:24:24.359
Caption: people

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:27.359
Caption: and we&#39;re doing this all the time so

00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:30.239
Caption: it&#39;s proven and our deployments uh

00:24:27.359 --> 00:24:33.359
Caption: deployment failures are rare

00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:35.099
Caption: um they they happen but we have we have

00:24:33.359 --> 00:24:37.020
Caption: a rollback procedure and everything

00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:40.739
Caption: works smoothly

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:43.200
Caption: okay so deploying at speed is not a leap

00:24:40.739 --> 00:24:44.760
Caption: of faith okay you don&#39;t just throw stuff

00:24:43.199 --> 00:24:46.819
Caption: into production and just cross your

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:50.880
Caption: fingers and hope right

00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:54.359
Caption: it&#39;s having that safety removes the fear

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:57.199
Caption: okay and that safety allows us to deploy

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:57.199
Caption: at speed

00:24:57.599 --> 00:25:06.359
Caption: that&#39;s it thank you

00:25:00.189 --> 00:25:08.339
Caption: [Applause]

00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:10.979
Caption: um so I think I assume we&#39;ve got heaps

00:25:08.339 --> 00:25:12.298
Caption: of time for questions yeah so yeah thank

00:25:10.979 --> 00:25:13.619
Caption: you very much still

00:25:12.298 --> 00:25:15.479
Caption: um now I&#39;ve got

00:25:13.619 --> 00:25:18.739
Caption: to owe for a q a session uh has anyone

00:25:15.479 --> 00:25:18.739
Caption: got any questions for them

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:34.919
Caption: um I guess being sort of still new to

00:25:32.159 --> 00:25:36.960
Caption: developing or whatever so wondering what

00:25:34.918 --> 00:25:38.699
Caption: these type of manual deployment

00:25:36.959 --> 00:25:41.880
Caption: processes kind of look like if they&#39;re

00:25:38.699 --> 00:25:43.219
Caption: like that much of a pain

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.719
Caption: um

00:25:43.219 --> 00:25:46.678
Caption: what do manual deployment processes look

00:25:45.719 --> 00:25:49.619
Caption: like

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:51.719
Caption: um I guess

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:55.500
Caption: I don&#39;t know it could it&#39;s different in

00:25:51.719 --> 00:25:58.739
Caption: every company uh so if

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:01.380
Caption: I I guess I&#39;m thinking about uh you know

00:25:58.739 --> 00:26:03.839
Caption: maybe the old days where you&#39;re ftping

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.219
Caption: your files onto a PHP server or

00:26:03.839 --> 00:26:08.339
Caption: something and then

00:26:05.219 --> 00:26:11.880
Caption: um or like manually copying your you

00:26:08.339 --> 00:26:14.459
Caption: know Wi-Fi onto a server that&#39;s like a

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:17.039
Caption: pet server that you keep alive

00:26:14.459 --> 00:26:19.500
Caption: um you know specifically and you don&#39;t

00:26:17.038 --> 00:26:22.859
Caption: you know create new ones all the time

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:25.619
Caption: you know like it&#39;s not basically

00:26:22.859 --> 00:26:27.599
Caption: um because that machine is uh you know

00:26:25.619 --> 00:26:29.279
Caption: set up by some person

00:26:27.599 --> 00:26:31.619
Caption: um somewhere five years ago that has

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:35.159
Caption: since left the company so you you&#39;re

00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:38.939
Caption: you&#39;re looking at you know setting up

00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:41.279
Caption: um VMS via code and basically all the

00:26:38.939 --> 00:26:43.918
Caption: pieces of infrastructure that you need

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:46.679
Caption: are set up by a code that&#39;s that&#39;s the

00:26:43.918 --> 00:26:48.899
Caption: automated like way I know that&#39;s sort of

00:26:46.678 --> 00:26:50.459
Caption: very vague but it is totally different

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.359
Caption: in every it depends what you&#39;re

00:26:50.459 --> 00:26:53.359
Caption: deploying foreign

00:26:54.839 --> 00:26:57.798
Caption: next question

00:27:03.119 --> 00:27:09.359
Caption: um I guess this depends a lot on talking

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.859
Caption: about client-side or um how do you prove

00:27:09.359 --> 00:27:12.538
Caption: that

00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:14.400
Caption: you know you need to expand the contract

00:27:12.538 --> 00:27:16.319
Caption: for example how do you prove

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.419
Caption: the say a property

00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:21.778
Caption: of an external

00:27:18.418 --> 00:27:23.579
Caption: API yeah yes yeah so I guess you&#39;re so

00:27:21.779 --> 00:27:26.700
Caption: sorry internal I mean within an

00:27:23.579 --> 00:27:31.079
Caption: organization but so within within an

00:27:26.699 --> 00:27:34.918
Caption: organization it&#39;s uh ideally much easier

00:27:31.079 --> 00:27:36.418
Caption: um uh so like there&#39;s there&#39;s plenty of

00:27:34.918 --> 00:27:39.000
Caption: tools out there like

00:27:36.418 --> 00:27:40.979
Caption: um ideally organization&#39;s got some sort

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.579
Caption: of co-depository and everyone can see

00:27:40.979 --> 00:27:45.599
Caption: that the usage of that code you know uh

00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:49.140
Caption: you should be able to know the

00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:49.678
Caption: dependencies of each of the systems so

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.959
Caption: um

00:27:49.678 --> 00:27:55.500
Caption: I guess I&#39;m thinking about

00:27:51.959 --> 00:27:58.619
Caption: um like Library like client libraries so

00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:01.319
Caption: um so if you&#39;re talking between apis an

00:27:58.619 --> 00:28:02.939
Caption: API might output some sort of client

00:28:01.319 --> 00:28:04.139
Caption: library and so you know that know the

00:28:02.939 --> 00:28:06.298
Caption: people that depend on that client

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:09.140
Caption: Library so you can check

00:28:06.298 --> 00:28:09.139
Caption: those usages

00:28:09.199 --> 00:28:15.119
Caption: external is much harder is a much harder

00:28:12.839 --> 00:28:17.520
Caption: thing it&#39;s essentially a library right

00:28:15.119 --> 00:28:20.579
Caption: so you have to you have to deprecate

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.760
Caption: fields and give comms to that and

00:28:20.579 --> 00:28:25.380
Caption: um wait a lot more time that that

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.640
Caption: becomes a much harder deal but

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:30.900
Caption: internally

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.979
Caption: this stuff is it shouldn&#39;t be hard it is

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.599
Caption: for all sorts of reasons but it

00:28:31.979 --> 00:28:36.418
Caption: shouldn&#39;t be hard and you can you can

00:28:33.599 --> 00:28:39.538
Caption: make great strides internally at least

00:28:36.418 --> 00:28:41.759
Caption: um I think I don&#39;t know I feel like that

00:28:39.538 --> 00:28:44.658
Caption: was super vague but yeah there&#39;s

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.659
Caption: definitely tools out there

00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:56.719
Caption: thank you

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:56.719
Caption: hey Dylan

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.380
Caption: you hear me no

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.239
Caption: he&#39;s turned off there yeah there we go

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.940
Caption: I&#39;m just going to expand on that

00:29:03.239 --> 00:29:08.158
Caption: question so a few years ago I had a bit

00:29:05.939 --> 00:29:11.298
Caption: of experience working with you

00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:14.460
Caption: um and here we go

00:29:11.298 --> 00:29:16.439
Caption: it was an awesome experience but um I

00:29:14.459 --> 00:29:18.898
Caption: love the expand roll out contract but

00:29:16.439 --> 00:29:21.599
Caption: adding to that question we experimented

00:29:18.899 --> 00:29:23.760
Caption: with like consumer driven

00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:26.099
Caption: um contract testing yeah but it never

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.659
Caption: really seemed to take hold it never

00:29:26.099 --> 00:29:29.579
Caption: really seemed to

00:29:27.659 --> 00:29:32.460
Caption: um like work and I was just wondering

00:29:29.579 --> 00:29:35.398
Caption: where did it land like um did you get it

00:29:32.459 --> 00:29:37.798
Caption: working or did you find other ways uh so

00:29:35.399 --> 00:29:39.059
Caption: so I have seen other implementations

00:29:37.798 --> 00:29:41.579
Caption: that worked

00:29:39.058 --> 00:29:43.500
Caption: um but we ended up ripping it out

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:46.739
Caption: um and going for as I was sort of

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.399
Caption: talking about before having a a client

00:29:46.739 --> 00:29:50.038
Caption: um

00:29:47.399 --> 00:29:54.059
Caption: so each API would spit out a client

00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:57.239
Caption: library and for either like back-end

00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:58.219
Caption: services so like Java or front end as

00:29:57.239 --> 00:30:02.339
Caption: well

00:29:58.219 --> 00:30:04.079
Caption: and the key to that is also that

00:30:02.339 --> 00:30:06.058
Caption: um so we would

00:30:04.079 --> 00:30:08.158
Caption: um so we had a lot of issues early days

00:30:06.058 --> 00:30:10.140
Caption: where we would make backwards

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:12.360
Caption: incompatible changes so we would just

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.500
Caption: sort of forget about consumers and break

00:30:12.359 --> 00:30:15.298
Caption: them

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.520
Caption: um thinking that contract testing was

00:30:15.298 --> 00:30:19.918
Caption: going to help us

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:22.140
Caption: so we ended up writing

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:23.339
Caption: um and there&#39;s again there&#39;s plenty of

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.320
Caption: tools out there that sort of check your

00:30:23.339 --> 00:30:27.199
Caption: Swagger and fail your build when you

00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:29.639
Caption: make backwards incompatible changes

00:30:27.199 --> 00:30:31.260
Caption: that&#39;s not to say that you that you

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.119
Caption: can&#39;t make them but you have to do it in

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:35.880
Caption: a measured way so you don&#39;t make them

00:30:33.119 --> 00:30:39.418
Caption: unless you have sort of proven and sort

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:42.359
Caption: of gone through all your you know git

00:30:39.418 --> 00:30:44.459
Caption: repos and checked that the other

00:30:42.359 --> 00:30:47.520
Caption: consumers are not using that field or

00:30:44.459 --> 00:30:49.918
Caption: that endpoint anymore and

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:52.020
Caption: and that&#39;s usually just a case of a

00:30:49.918 --> 00:30:54.418
Caption: search

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.940
Caption: but but yeah first of all you don&#39;t make

00:30:54.418 --> 00:30:59.339
Caption: those backwards incompatible changes by

00:30:56.939 --> 00:31:02.178
Caption: default at least

00:30:59.339 --> 00:31:02.178
Caption: cool thank you

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.219
Caption: uh yeah about feature toggling so I&#39;ve

00:31:08.699 --> 00:31:13.439
Caption: seen feature toggling uh fail terribly

00:31:11.219 --> 00:31:16.558
Caption: uh thankfully not because of me but of

00:31:13.439 --> 00:31:19.259
Caption: some people and I was a very fortunate

00:31:16.558 --> 00:31:21.178
Caption: spectator about it so so I&#39;ve seen it

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.459
Caption: fail many times even though I were I was

00:31:21.178 --> 00:31:25.558
Caption: perfectly capable of doing so also my

00:31:23.459 --> 00:31:27.178
Caption: project my question is that um do you

00:31:25.558 --> 00:31:30.719
Caption: think feature toggling is more of an

00:31:27.178 --> 00:31:33.719
Caption: engineering thing than a devops thingy

00:31:30.719 --> 00:31:36.178
Caption: um so so I have devops in my the talk

00:31:33.719 --> 00:31:39.418
Caption: title but I think

00:31:36.178 --> 00:31:40.500
Caption: I think the concept of having it so

00:31:39.418 --> 00:31:43.439
Caption: first of all I think the concept of

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:45.418
Caption: having devops as a as a role or

00:31:43.439 --> 00:31:47.398
Caption: something feels like it&#39;s defeating the

00:31:45.418 --> 00:31:50.639
Caption: purpose of devops

00:31:47.399 --> 00:31:53.480
Caption: um but uh I guess

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.479
Caption: uh

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.058
Caption: I think I&#39;ve lost track of what I was

00:31:55.439 --> 00:31:59.298
Caption: thinking what ask your question again

00:31:57.058 --> 00:31:59.298
Caption: sorry

00:32:00.479 --> 00:32:05.819
Caption: yeah okay so so that&#39;s I guess my

00:32:02.819 --> 00:32:07.619
Caption: thought is it should there&#39;s there&#39;s no

00:32:05.819 --> 00:32:10.918
Caption: distinction for me

00:32:07.619 --> 00:32:12.719
Caption: um engineering Engineers are the like

00:32:10.918 --> 00:32:14.158
Caption: the whole point of devops is that you&#39;ve

00:32:12.719 --> 00:32:19.739
Caption: just got

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:19.740
Caption: smart people doing like work right

00:32:23.659 --> 00:32:29.520
Caption: ideally right so so so the the point of

00:32:27.899 --> 00:32:31.980
Caption: devops is like that you&#39;re you&#39;re

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.260
Caption: bringing in all these um people and

00:32:31.979 --> 00:32:37.140
Caption: working together so I mean maybe it&#39;s

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:40.380
Caption: not one person maybe it&#39;s one team but

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:41.880
Caption: um but distinguishing between like

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.859
Caption: actually

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:46.140
Caption: uh having a specific role for devops

00:32:43.859 --> 00:32:48.418
Caption: doesn&#39;t make sense to me because you&#39;re

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:50.399
Caption: just a team of people working towards

00:32:48.418 --> 00:32:54.239
Caption: improving

00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:54.239
Caption: yeah yeah

00:32:56.819 --> 00:33:00.380
Caption: Yeah well yeah

00:33:01.918 --> 00:33:06.479
Caption: yeah I had to learn um yeah my question

00:33:04.439 --> 00:33:09.119
Caption: is also about feature toggling so I&#39;ve

00:33:06.479 --> 00:33:10.979
Caption: seen you know teams losing track of the

00:33:09.119 --> 00:33:14.579
Caption: toggles not keeping up

00:33:10.979 --> 00:33:17.640
Caption: um did you have any kind of tooling

00:33:14.579 --> 00:33:19.918
Caption: um in place or also you kind of present

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:22.558
Caption: it to maybe the business and look that&#39;s

00:33:19.918 --> 00:33:24.719
Caption: that&#39;s in production now we we turn it

00:33:22.558 --> 00:33:27.418
Caption: on and then we clean it up kind because

00:33:24.719 --> 00:33:29.398
Caption: let&#39;s say 14 30 components yeah you

00:33:27.418 --> 00:33:32.158
Caption: might lose them yeah yeah so so that was

00:33:29.399 --> 00:33:36.600
Caption: a that&#39;s a big thing for us so

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:40.080
Caption: um so Bankwest we&#39;re using um sort of uh

00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:42.239
Caption: uh I would say like internal tools for

00:33:40.079 --> 00:33:44.579
Caption: for the feature toggles and also

00:33:42.239 --> 00:33:46.859
Caption: managing them uh but we

00:33:44.579 --> 00:33:48.778
Caption: we definitely had visibility of what

00:33:46.859 --> 00:33:50.398
Caption: toggles each team owned

00:33:48.779 --> 00:33:52.799
Caption: um how long they&#39;d been

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:54.840
Caption: um turned on uh the state of them in

00:33:52.798 --> 00:33:56.639
Caption: each of our environments

00:33:54.839 --> 00:33:57.538
Caption: um so we had full visibility and you

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.979
Caption: know

00:33:57.538 --> 00:34:00.599
Caption: I don&#39;t know it seemed silly but like if

00:33:58.979 --> 00:34:02.640
Caption: they got too old they would go they

00:34:00.599 --> 00:34:04.798
Caption: would go red right we would know that

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:07.200
Caption: this thing is getting old um there was

00:34:04.798 --> 00:34:09.300
Caption: like a it has to be a conscious decision

00:34:07.199 --> 00:34:10.979
Caption: to keep that thing around because it&#39;s

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:15.060
Caption: like in your face

00:34:10.979 --> 00:34:17.638
Caption: um and like uh you know that was all

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:20.280
Caption: custom stuff but like tools like launch

00:34:17.638 --> 00:34:23.219
Caption: Darkly and stuff um which are the you

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:25.918
Caption: know popular popular ones in the um you

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:27.540
Caption: know outside world uh they they have all

00:34:25.918 --> 00:34:30.300
Caption: this stuff like you can see how old

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:32.339
Caption: toggles are and um you know we we

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.619
Caption: basically wouldn&#39;t start work

00:34:32.339 --> 00:34:36.839
Caption: um or wouldn&#39;t be able to deliver our

00:34:34.618 --> 00:34:38.338
Caption: new feature until we&#39;d gotten rid of the

00:34:36.839 --> 00:34:41.159
Caption: old feature toggles

00:34:38.339 --> 00:34:43.859
Caption: um so like yeah I mean that&#39;s a bit of

00:34:41.158 --> 00:34:46.439
Caption: process but like you have to have that

00:34:43.858 --> 00:34:49.079
Caption: ability to you know something to audit

00:34:46.439 --> 00:34:52.098
Caption: like removing stuff otherwise I just

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.099
Caption: forget it&#39;s forgotten about

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.439
Caption: um

00:34:55.618 --> 00:35:01.858
Caption: appointment but as a consumer of the

00:34:58.439 --> 00:35:04.560
Caption: database and I did a lot of analytic

00:35:01.858 --> 00:35:07.679
Caption: um machine learning and in your example

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.320
Caption: you change the field name that will

00:35:07.679 --> 00:35:12.780
Caption: break my code

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:16.199
Caption: how you um make my life easy as well

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:18.479
Caption: yeah right so so

00:35:16.199 --> 00:35:21.300
Caption: um I guess that&#39;s why that&#39;s why you&#39;re

00:35:18.479 --> 00:35:23.639
Caption: taking the measured approach of not

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.500
Caption: renaming it&#39;s so there&#39;s no such thing

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:27.959
Caption: as a rename basically

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:30.239
Caption: um there&#39;s there&#39;s a an ad and a remove

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:32.280
Caption: but it&#39;s a considered step so

00:35:30.239 --> 00:35:34.379
Caption: um in the case of say a database you

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.780
Caption: would be adding a column and populating

00:35:34.379 --> 00:35:39.299
Caption: both columns okay and no one&#39;s using

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:41.339
Caption: that other column you would migrate the

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:45.179
Caption: data into that other column maybe as a

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:47.460
Caption: second step only once both columns are

00:35:45.179 --> 00:35:48.838
Caption: sort of working in tandem then you can

00:35:47.459 --> 00:35:51.540
Caption: switch over to actually using that new

00:35:48.839 --> 00:35:52.920
Caption: column so then that would be at the

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.140
Caption: point that you would start to use that

00:35:52.919 --> 00:35:57.838
Caption: new column and once we&#39;ve proven that

00:35:55.139 --> 00:35:59.879
Caption: your using it and so is everyone else

00:35:57.839 --> 00:36:02.400
Caption: then we can drop that that other column

00:35:59.879 --> 00:36:04.759
Caption: that would be the approach

00:36:02.399 --> 00:36:04.760
Caption: thank you

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.599
Caption: hello

00:36:11.459 --> 00:36:18.479
Caption: um I have for testing

00:36:14.599 --> 00:36:21.599
Caption: when do you use a load balancer and to

00:36:18.479 --> 00:36:24.000
Caption: divert some of your traffic to the new

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:27.020
Caption: feature and roll it out slowly rather

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.020
Caption: than use feature request

00:36:28.858 --> 00:36:31.739
Caption: um

00:36:29.579 --> 00:36:34.739
Caption: so that&#39;s to be honest not something

00:36:31.739 --> 00:36:36.679
Caption: I&#39;ve really ever tried

00:36:34.739 --> 00:36:39.719
Caption: um it&#39;s

00:36:36.679 --> 00:36:42.780
Caption: uh I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a valid approach but

00:36:39.719 --> 00:36:44.338
Caption: most of the stuff that I have done is

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:47.040
Caption: more about

00:36:44.339 --> 00:36:50.820
Caption: um you would deploy

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:54.179
Caption: um so I guess that&#39;s more about like uh

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:56.760
Caption: uh what&#39;s called like

00:36:54.179 --> 00:36:59.159
Caption: like basically shadowing requests to

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:04.260
Caption: some sort of um to some sort of system

00:36:59.159 --> 00:37:04.260
Caption: before you take it and make it live but

00:37:04.618 --> 00:37:08.699
Caption: yeah I I don&#39;t have experience

00:37:06.479 --> 00:37:10.560
Caption: personally most of it most of the things

00:37:08.699 --> 00:37:11.760
Caption: I do is like you actually deploy the

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.040
Caption: thing into production

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:16.739
Caption: um and the code is inactive so so you

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:18.660
Caption: actually you&#39;re not really having two

00:37:16.739 --> 00:37:21.479
Caption: versions running at once you&#39;re just

00:37:18.659 --> 00:37:24.719
Caption: switching over and then you can uh

00:37:21.479 --> 00:37:27.358
Caption: control uh turn on some toggle or some

00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:28.679
Caption: toggle for specific users yeah it&#39;s more

00:37:27.358 --> 00:37:31.159
Caption: about that that&#39;s easier to reason about

00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:31.159
Caption: in my head

00:37:35.159 --> 00:37:39.838
Caption: um so I guess it&#39;s pretty much down to

00:37:37.858 --> 00:37:41.399
Caption: the concept that we&#39;re deploying with a

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:44.520
Caption: high level of frequency

00:37:41.399 --> 00:37:47.179
Caption: which implies to me that

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:49.619
Caption: we&#39;re more prone to

00:37:47.179 --> 00:37:50.879
Caption: put bugs into the production environment

00:37:49.618 --> 00:37:53.159
Caption: although I understand that&#39;s probably

00:37:50.879 --> 00:37:55.618
Caption: with a smaller user base yeah

00:37:53.159 --> 00:37:58.559
Caption: how do you

00:37:55.618 --> 00:38:00.598
Caption: Rush rationalize that like is is it just

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.820
Caption: subjective do you go oh well these users

00:38:00.599 --> 00:38:04.859
Caption: are prepared to cop it so it&#39;s okay or

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.959
Caption: what&#39;s going on there yeah yeah okay so

00:38:04.858 --> 00:38:10.259
Caption: I totally get that so we&#39;re so releasing

00:38:06.959 --> 00:38:13.139
Caption: more often uh more likely that code is

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:15.118
Caption: less ready and getting into the hands of

00:38:13.139 --> 00:38:19.919
Caption: our users right so so the key thing is

00:38:15.118 --> 00:38:21.419
Caption: that ideally where ex so with feature

00:38:19.919 --> 00:38:22.618
Caption: toggles you&#39;re exposing less of your

00:38:21.419 --> 00:38:25.260
Caption: users

00:38:22.618 --> 00:38:27.959
Caption: um so you&#39;re maybe only exposing your

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:30.139
Caption: team initially right and I know that&#39;s

00:38:27.959 --> 00:38:32.879
Caption: hard for depending on your system

00:38:30.139 --> 00:38:35.098
Caption: because some depending on your system

00:38:32.879 --> 00:38:35.879
Caption: your your users are

00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:38.280
Caption: um

00:38:35.879 --> 00:38:40.319
Caption: like your team is not really able to dog

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.699
Caption: food you&#39;re you&#39;re out right

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.780
Caption: um particularly in the case of Bankwest

00:38:41.699 --> 00:38:45.239
Caption: where

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:47.339
Caption: um like our my team wasn&#39;t applying for

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:49.079
Caption: a home loan every week

00:38:47.339 --> 00:38:50.579
Caption: um so so but we&#39;ve got other

00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:52.500
Caption: environments where we do that right

00:38:50.579 --> 00:38:54.540
Caption: where we might turn on in that

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.060
Caption: particular environment we might turn on

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:58.619
Caption: just for my team until until we&#39;re

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.719
Caption: really happy so we&#39;re not even affecting

00:38:58.618 --> 00:39:02.039
Caption: other teams we&#39;re just affecting my team

00:39:00.719 --> 00:39:04.320
Caption: okay the team that&#39;s actually building

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:08.280
Caption: out that functionality

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:10.859
Caption: um it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely a risk

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:13.560
Caption: um but I would trade it off with

00:39:10.858 --> 00:39:15.059
Caption: um the fact that if you&#39;re bulking up

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.859
Caption: you know two months of changes and

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.300
Caption: sending that into production and that

00:39:16.858 --> 00:39:20.639
Caption: breaks like

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.500
Caption: well what went wrong

00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:23.519
Caption: two months of work like I have to sift

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.199
Caption: through two months of work to figure out

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:28.979
Caption: what the hell went wrong that&#39;s going to

00:39:25.199 --> 00:39:30.899
Caption: take me much longer than say that one

00:39:28.979 --> 00:39:33.838
Caption: thing that I send it right I guess just

00:39:30.899 --> 00:39:35.639
Caption: to add to that so it is it seems like it

00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:37.800
Caption: is kind of subjective we haven&#39;t

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:40.500
Caption: necessarily been able to quantify doing

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:43.439
Caption: this way has less impact than doing the

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:45.300
Caption: other way it just like seems that way

00:39:43.439 --> 00:39:47.280
Caption: because we&#39;re not as stressed in the

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.260
Caption: yeah it&#39;s a large releases of

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:52.739
Caption: deployments yeah

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:54.540
Caption: um but yeah I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have no

00:39:52.739 --> 00:39:55.919
Caption: for sure I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have I don&#39;t

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:59.719
Caption: have numbers

00:39:55.919 --> 00:40:02.219
Caption: um but I uh I guess

00:39:59.719 --> 00:40:03.719
Caption: uh I guess I&#39;ve definitely seen the

00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:05.939
Caption: alternative

00:40:03.719 --> 00:40:08.760
Caption: um so from my experience

00:40:05.939 --> 00:40:12.719
Caption: um I&#39;ve seen deployments go wrong and go

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:15.659
Caption: go wrong catastrophically way more

00:40:12.719 --> 00:40:17.820
Caption: um uh when you&#39;re deploying you know

00:40:15.659 --> 00:40:20.639
Caption: monthly or whatever yes it seems like

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:22.079
Caption: the impact will be less with a higher

00:40:20.639 --> 00:40:23.819
Caption: frequency of deployment even if there

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:25.739
Caption: are more bugs they&#39;re not less damaging

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.719
Caption: so maybe that&#39;s okay and it&#39;s and it&#39;s

00:40:25.739 --> 00:40:30.959
Caption: way less stress as a developer which

00:40:27.719 --> 00:40:32.820
Caption: ideally uh also in turn makes for Less

00:40:30.959 --> 00:40:35.899
Caption: bugs but for sure I don&#39;t have numbers

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.900
Caption: no thanks

00:40:39.239 --> 00:40:44.399
Caption: oh great

00:40:40.739 --> 00:40:47.159
Caption: um so I also I work at a bank I work for

00:40:44.399 --> 00:40:49.379
Caption: up which is now owned by Bendigo so we

00:40:47.159 --> 00:40:53.039
Caption: we ship six to ten times a day but

00:40:49.379 --> 00:40:55.858
Caption: Bendigo might ship once every few months

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.079
Caption: um were there any things you had to do

00:40:55.858 --> 00:41:01.259
Caption: to bring the other teams within the bank

00:40:58.079 --> 00:41:03.540
Caption: along this journey to allow you to

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:06.540
Caption: ship multiple times a day and release

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:09.959
Caption: more frequently thinking like Risk teams

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:10.859
Caption: and those yeah yeah so that&#39;s definitely

00:41:09.959 --> 00:41:12.260
Caption: um

00:41:10.858 --> 00:41:15.479
Caption: uh

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:19.618
Caption: that&#39;s definitely a hard one right

00:41:15.479 --> 00:41:24.419
Caption: um and I think uh what made it possible

00:41:19.618 --> 00:41:26.279
Caption: at least at Bankwest was uh the setup of

00:41:24.419 --> 00:41:29.520
Caption: the team so so again when when these

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:31.679
Caption: things arise say for deployments we we

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.419
Caption: brought in our system Engineers into the

00:41:31.679 --> 00:41:34.679
Caption: team

00:41:32.419 --> 00:41:37.799
Caption: so actually having

00:41:34.679 --> 00:41:40.379
Caption: like bringing the critical people

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.839
Caption: um on the par like critical expertise

00:41:40.379 --> 00:41:46.078
Caption: bring them actually into our our teams

00:41:42.839 --> 00:41:47.880
Caption: even or our you know our project sphere

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:49.380
Caption: or whatever you want to call it

00:41:47.879 --> 00:41:51.659
Caption: um but actually bringing them in so so

00:41:49.379 --> 00:41:53.639
Caption: their goals are your goals

00:41:51.659 --> 00:41:54.719
Caption: um it&#39;s like it&#39;s not an easy problem

00:41:53.639 --> 00:41:55.439
Caption: for sure

00:41:54.719 --> 00:41:57.598
Caption: um there&#39;s a lot of different

00:41:55.439 --> 00:41:59.760
Caption: disciplines that need to be involved but

00:41:57.599 --> 00:42:01.920
Caption: ideally where you can bring them in and

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.179
Caption: so you&#39;re both heading in that same
