00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.760
Caption: small apology just in case you google my

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:26.639
Caption: name and find the panel that i did on

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:28.799
Caption: wednesday for abc radio perth a caller

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.720

00:02:32.238 --> 00:02:34.720

Caption: company who might smell sell smart homes

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:46.800
Caption: um but that&#39;s that&#39;s the lens that i&#39;m

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:50.000
Caption: bringing today uh so as i&#39;m talking

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.680
Caption: about ethical or responsible technology

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.360
Caption: i&#39;m approaching this topic from these

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.279
Caption: specific lenses

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.199
Caption: and i found that working in technology

00:02:55.279 --> 00:03:01.598
Caption: and engaging with activism are quite

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:01.598
Caption: similar they&#39;re both about oh my god

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.119
Caption: okay working in tech and engaging in

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:09.359
Caption: activism they&#39;re both very similar

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.878
Caption: they&#39;re about imagining different

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.199
Caption: versions of the world and trying to

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:15.279
Caption: usher them into existence

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:17.440
Caption: so at the center of this venn diagram is

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:19.919
Caption: where my career has led me now i&#39;m a

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.919

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:53.518
Caption: so you may have seen this map before

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:55.839
Caption: it&#39;s a representation of the different

00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:57.919
Caption: language groups in this country i come

00:03:55.839 --> 00:04:00.399

Caption: communities i cannot speak for them nor

00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:08.559
Caption: can any individual and one thing i want

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.559
Caption: to highlight which i think this map

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:12.878
Caption: makes really clear is that indigenous

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:14.720
Caption: cultures are not monolithic

00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:17.279
Caption: each area on this map represents a

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.759

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:22.720

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:24.559
Caption: customs knowledge systems and law

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.559
Caption: but there are commonalities even with

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:29.919
Caption: other indigenous cultures in other parts

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:32.720
Caption: of the world and when i say indigenous

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.360
Caption: epistemologies or knowledge systems this

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.799

00:04:36.799 --> 00:04:40.319
Caption: collective well-being

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:43.679
Caption: knowledge of flora and fauna and

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.440
Caption: astronomy so this bug is just really

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:47.839
Caption: it&#39;s really distracting me it&#39;s moving

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.119
Caption: closer and closer hang on

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:51.279
Caption: it&#39;s a

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:53.600
Caption: is it a bug or is it a feature

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:55.279
Caption: there you go

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.279
Caption: okay thank you

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:59.759
Caption: thanks cara you&#39;re a woman of many

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:02.880
Caption: talents um so

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.959
Caption: these knowledge systems reflect over 60

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.800
Caption: 000 years of refined knowledge and

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:09.119

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:12.000
Caption: complex adaptive systems

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:14.479
Caption: so when i hear that i can only sit in

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.679
Caption: awe and reverence of the cultures that

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.679
Caption: we get to live with today

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:22.239

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:23.600

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:41.119

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:46.880
Caption: we suspect these are thousands of years

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.880
Caption: old and they represent sophisticated

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.440

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.320

Caption: river

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.360
Caption: and the fascinating thing to me is not

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:19.599
Caption: just the products of technology that

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:21.359
Caption: emerge from indigenous knowledge systems

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.520

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:31.758

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:33.679
Caption: pretty perfectly

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.319

Caption: sustain and nurture all life

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.799
Caption: this could be conceived as akin to code

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:49.800
Caption: or coding

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.759
Caption: one of my favorite examples of

00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:01.598
Caption: indigenous knowledge literally embedded

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:03.759
Caption: into the technology that we use comes

00:07:01.598 --> 00:07:06.079

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:15.919
Caption: these rugs while beautiful also

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.359

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:21.038
Caption: the production work in that facility

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:22.880

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.360
Caption: and designing circuit boards it turns

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:30.479
Caption: out also requires the same kind of

00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:32.000
Caption: dedication to craft and imagination when

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:34.479

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.160

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:41.679

00:07:41.679 --> 00:07:45.679

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:47.759
Caption: about building the future of technology

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:50.399

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:55.279

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:57.119
Caption: enormous topic

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:59.679
Caption: and translating between cultures

00:07:57.119 --> 00:08:01.839
Caption: inevitably compresses complexity

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:04.399
Caption: particularly when we&#39;re condensing this

00:08:01.839 --> 00:08:06.000
Caption: knowledge into a 45 minute time slot but

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:08.799
Caption: there are some themes that i want to

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.799
Caption: specifically talk about

00:08:08.799 --> 00:08:12.638
Caption: so learning about indigenous knowledge

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:15.279
Caption: systems and their relationship to modern

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:18.080

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:25.598

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:33.119
Caption: systems like this

00:08:31.119 --> 00:08:35.200
Caption: when we consider knowledge systems from

00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:36.958
Caption: a first nations perspective we&#39;re

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.958
Caption: looking at the many interconnected

00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.880
Caption: relationships or pieces of knowledge

00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:43.039
Caption: that overlap and interact with each

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.080
Caption: other without conflict this is often

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:48.000
Caption: referred to as kinship or balance

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.600
Caption: when first nations communities think in

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.919
Caption: systems we&#39;re seeing how the

00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:54.239
Caption: interrelated parts of an ecosystem or

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:56.079
Caption: set of knowledges relate to one another

00:08:54.239 --> 00:08:57.760
Caption: and are continuously shaped by these

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.519
Caption: interrelationships

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.838
Caption: indigenous knowledge systems are not

00:08:59.518 --> 00:09:03.679
Caption: necessarily items or pieces of

00:09:01.838 --> 00:09:06.159
Caption: information in discrete units or

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:07.359
Caption: artifacts but methods of understanding

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:10.000
Caption: the world

00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:12.000
Caption: which leads us to systems theory

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.919
Caption: i&#39;ll give a quick primer in systems

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.919
Caption: theory and i won&#39;t go into too much

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:16.799
Caption: detail because that is a whole other

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:18.958
Caption: talk

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:20.958
Caption: but a system is essentially a set of

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.479
Caption: things interconnected in such a way that

00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.479
Caption: they produce their own pattern of

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:26.880
Caption: behavior over time

00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:29.359
Caption: as technology becomes more complicated

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.679
Caption: and abstracted being familiar with

00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:33.039
Caption: systems theory as a way of thinking can

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:34.640
Caption: help us make sense of the world that

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:37.119
Caption: we&#39;re creating

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.200
Caption: a classic feature of a system is this

00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:42.479
Caption: feedback loop with

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.559
Caption: elements or nodes or actors in a system

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:47.119
Caption: some kind of interconnectedness or

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:49.518
Caption: relationships between those elements

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:51.679
Caption: protocols or rules that govern how the

00:09:49.518 --> 00:09:52.559
Caption: elements behave in a relationship to one

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:55.039
Caption: another

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:58.880
Caption: and a goal or function of the system

00:09:55.039 --> 00:10:00.799
Caption: what is it doing what is its purpose

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.359
Caption: the one thing i want to remember is that

00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:05.440
Caption: technology isn&#39;t neutral we like to

00:10:03.359 --> 00:10:07.760
Caption: think that technologies like machine

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.559
Caption: learning or other types of algorithmic

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.398
Caption: decision making as purely rational and

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:14.159
Caption: scientific because we&#39;ve somehow

00:10:12.398 --> 00:10:15.359
Caption: abstracted ourselves away from their

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:17.679
Caption: output

00:10:15.359 --> 00:10:20.880
Caption: but anything built by humans or any

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:22.880
Caption: human design system will exhibit bias

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.640
Caption: the risk is as more people rely on

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.880
Caption: technology for daily activities they&#39;re

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.838
Caption: also more subject to unintended and

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.640
Caption: downright hostile consequences

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:34.479
Caption: so what kind of protocols or rules

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.320
Caption: currently govern the technology that

00:10:34.479 --> 00:10:38.078
Caption: we&#39;re building today

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.600
Caption: for any profit driven initiative it

00:10:38.078 --> 00:10:41.919
Caption: might look like

00:10:39.599 --> 00:10:44.319
Caption: collect mine extract

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:46.000
Caption: gather as much information and data from

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.720
Caption: as many different sources as possible

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.200
Caption: without any plan of what to do with them

00:10:48.719 --> 00:10:52.879
Caption: or why you&#39;re collecting it

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.958
Caption: automate everything

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.239
Caption: break any task into smaller tasks to

00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.679
Caption: achieve endlessly increasing

00:10:56.239 --> 00:11:01.200
Caption: productivity

00:10:57.679 --> 00:11:03.518
Caption: and limitless growth the perverse

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.518
Caption: incentive of limitless growth is often

00:11:03.518 --> 00:11:07.679
Caption: unfathomable to cultures who have

00:11:05.518 --> 00:11:09.440
Caption: maintained balance with country and

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:10.880
Caption: refined knowledge to persist for

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.200
Caption: millennia

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.760
Caption: and i want to reiterate that there&#39;s

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.239
Caption: nothing inevitable about these

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.320
Caption: parameters or rules that we apply to

00:11:18.239 --> 00:11:23.119
Caption: thick technology that we can build we

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.600
Caption: can choose new ones

00:11:23.119 --> 00:11:28.000
Caption: and the thing about a system is they

00:11:25.599 --> 00:11:31.679
Caption: they have a terrible tendency to produce

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.119
Caption: exactly and only or you ask them to

00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:36.559
Caption: in other words

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:38.640
Caption: the purpose of a system is what it does

00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:40.479
Caption: when we see unintended consequences of

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.398
Caption: the tools that we build rather than

00:11:40.479 --> 00:11:45.119
Caption: write those consequences off as

00:11:42.398 --> 00:11:47.278
Caption: aberrations or outliers we must

00:11:45.119 --> 00:11:48.958
Caption: recognize the system is doing exactly

00:11:47.278 --> 00:11:50.719
Caption: what it was told to do and take some

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.119
Caption: responsibility

00:11:50.719 --> 00:11:56.319
Caption: we need to build for misuse and abuse

00:11:53.119 --> 00:11:57.919
Caption: cases not just use cases and good

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.479
Caption: intentions while necessary are not

00:11:57.919 --> 00:12:00.479
Caption: sufficient

00:12:01.119 --> 00:12:04.239
Caption: if the purpose of a system is what it

00:12:03.359 --> 00:12:06.398
Caption: does

00:12:04.239 --> 00:12:08.559
Caption: at the moment the system is setting the

00:12:06.398 --> 00:12:11.719
Caption: ocean on fire and over policing people

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:11.719
Caption: of color

00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:18.719
Caption: so what is ethical or responsible

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.880
Caption: technology

00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:24.479
Caption: essentially it&#39;s technology that seeks

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.479
Caption: to support us and not exploit us if we

00:12:24.479 --> 00:12:29.039
Caption: seek to address fractured political

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:30.799
Caption: economic and social systems i suspect

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:34.159
Caption: indigenous knowledge systems could be

00:12:30.799 --> 00:12:36.000
Caption: critical to this new way of building

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:37.759
Caption: and we can break down this process of

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.838
Caption: building ethical technology through

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.278
Caption: these multiple lenses which i&#39;ve

00:12:39.838 --> 00:12:43.119
Caption: borrowed from a very thorough

00:12:41.278 --> 00:12:45.760
Caption: thoughtworks guide

00:12:43.119 --> 00:12:47.518
Caption: it isn&#39;t simply about having one person

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.760
Caption: in the room taking your product and

00:12:47.518 --> 00:12:51.200
Caption: waving an ethics wand over it before you

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.880
Caption: go to market

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.518
Caption: but it&#39;s about interrogating

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.359
Caption: systematically the inputs outputs and

00:12:55.518 --> 00:12:58.559
Caption: ways of working at every step of

00:12:57.359 --> 00:13:00.078
Caption: production

00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:02.479
Caption: about capability

00:13:00.078 --> 00:13:04.958
Caption: constantly improving the organization

00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:06.638
Caption: and its products it&#39;s about diversity

00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.320
Caption: making sure that there is a range of

00:13:06.638 --> 00:13:10.159
Caption: viewpoints in the room from the very

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.838
Caption: start of a project

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:13.359
Caption: and making sure multiple stakeholders

00:13:11.838 --> 00:13:15.599
Caption: are considered

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:17.679
Caption: it&#39;s a remarkably difficult

00:13:15.599 --> 00:13:20.078
Caption: act to imagine the viewpoint of someone

00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:21.919
Caption: else more difficult than we expect it&#39;s

00:13:20.078 --> 00:13:23.760
Caption: why building diverse teams is so

00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:26.239
Caption: important it isn&#39;t just to tick a box

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.320
Caption: exercise on your rap but critical to

00:13:26.239 --> 00:13:30.799
Caption: building technology whose purpose is to

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.799
Caption: enhance collective well-being

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:34.799
Caption: also about methodology

00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:35.919
Caption: and formalizing ethical processes where

00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:38.638
Caption: feasible

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:41.440
Caption: and inquiry systematically asking those

00:13:38.638 --> 00:13:43.278
Caption: tough questions

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.119
Caption: at the beginning of this year i was

00:13:43.278 --> 00:13:47.039
Caption: fortunate to participate in an

00:13:45.119 --> 00:13:49.039
Caption: indigenous protocols in artificial

00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:50.398
Caption: intelligence incubator

00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:53.039
Caption: it was

00:13:50.398 --> 00:13:55.440
Caption: coordinated by angie abdullah and tyson

00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:57.440
Caption: juncker porter who hannah mentioned in

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.198
Caption: the keynote this morning

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.958
Caption: the intention of building these

00:13:59.198 --> 00:14:03.278
Caption: protocols is to

00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:04.799
Caption: protect indigenous communities and

00:14:03.278 --> 00:14:07.760
Caption: natural resources

00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:10.320
Caption: help prove improve ailing ai

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.880
Caption: reduce the harms of ai position

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.880
Caption: indigenous peoples as leading developers

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.720
Caption: to create respectful and nourishing

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.919
Caption: relationships with artificial

00:14:16.719 --> 00:14:19.679
Caption: intelligence

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:22.078
Caption: and to project thanks towards

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:23.838
Caption: technologies so many of these protocols

00:14:22.078 --> 00:14:25.278
Caption: i talk about today emerge from this

00:14:23.838 --> 00:14:27.278
Caption: working group which i share with

00:14:25.278 --> 00:14:29.440
Caption: permission

00:14:27.278 --> 00:14:31.440
Caption: i want to take a step back

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.479
Caption: and elaborate on what an acknowledgement

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.159
Caption: means

00:14:32.479 --> 00:14:37.039
Caption: at the beginning of my talk and at the

00:14:34.159 --> 00:14:38.239
Caption: beginning of the conference today we

00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:39.919
Caption: go through this

00:14:38.239 --> 00:14:42.078
Caption: acknowledgement they&#39;ve become a

00:14:39.919 --> 00:14:44.239
Caption: commonplace ritual for a lot of events

00:14:42.078 --> 00:14:47.039
Caption: over the past few years so it would be

00:14:44.239 --> 00:14:49.198
Caption: very easy to become fatigued like saying

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:50.320
Caption: a word over and over until it loses its

00:14:49.198 --> 00:14:53.518
Caption: meaning

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.600
Caption: but the land we&#39;re on today is unseated

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:57.760
Caption: which means it was stolen forcefully and

00:14:55.599 --> 00:14:59.278
Caption: often violently

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.119
Caption: acknowledging that uninterrupted

00:14:59.278 --> 00:15:03.599
Caption: connection to country in spite of

00:15:01.119 --> 00:15:05.760
Caption: displacement disenfranchisement is one

00:15:03.599 --> 00:15:07.599

Caption: this thing called indigenous sovereignty

00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:27.119

00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:29.039

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.559

00:15:54.239 --> 00:15:59.039

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:20.239

00:16:28.638 --> 00:16:31.679

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.880

00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:38.880

Caption: the way that we approach building tech

00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:59.119

Caption: extend to indigenous or other vulnerable

00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:03.838

00:18:43.678 --> 00:18:49.359

00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:53.119

Caption: perspective

00:18:57.359 --> 00:19:02.239

00:18:59.839 --> 00:19:04.400

00:19:02.239 --> 00:19:06.719

Caption: specific territories genealogies and

Caption: protocols and ultimately our goal is

00:19:09.678 --> 00:19:14.000
Caption: that we as a species figure out how to

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.880
Caption: treat these new non-human kin

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.520

00:19:23.678 --> 00:19:27.439

00:19:56.719 --> 00:20:01.760

00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:03.760

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.400

00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:59.839

00:21:52.159 --> 00:21:56.720

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:59.199

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.239

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:58.640
Caption: this is how we arrive at that kinship

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.640
Caption: and balance of an ecosystem

00:22:59.038 --> 00:23:05.439
Caption: so custodianship emerges from this idea

00:23:01.678 --> 00:23:07.279
Caption: of relationality as responsibility

00:23:05.439 --> 00:23:09.519
Caption: when talking about land management

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.640
Caption: custodianship may mean responsibility

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.599
Caption: and deep connection to lands waters

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.280
Caption: animals plants and ecosystems

00:23:15.599 --> 00:23:20.479
Caption: and i want to make the distinction

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.479
Caption: between custodianship and ownership

00:23:20.479 --> 00:23:24.640
Caption: modern technology built from western

00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:26.239
Caption: epistemologies prioritizes this

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.799
Caption: custodianship of

00:23:26.239 --> 00:23:30.640
Caption: this concept of ownership

00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:32.719
Caption: this is mine whatever i&#39;ve collected

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.039
Caption: belongs to me and i can make a profit

00:23:32.719 --> 00:23:37.599
Caption: off it someday probably

00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:39.519
Caption: custodians have a responsibility on the

00:23:37.599 --> 00:23:41.599
Caption: other hand to care for country

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.919
Caption: and recognize that country health and

00:23:41.599 --> 00:23:46.479
Caption: culture are all connected

00:23:43.918 --> 00:23:48.719
Caption: so particularly when thinking about data

00:23:46.479 --> 00:23:50.880
Caption: governance and data protection we can

00:23:48.719 --> 00:23:52.959
Caption: apply this concept of custodianship and

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.640
Caption: taking only what you need and extend it

00:23:52.959 --> 00:23:56.640
Caption: to data minimization practices

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.799
Caption: so

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.000
Caption: who are the custodians of digital

00:24:00.798 --> 00:24:05.119
Caption: landscapes

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.239
Caption: if they don&#39;t exist in a physical space

00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:10.239
Caption: it&#39;s hard to tell who owns it or who is

00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:13.359
Caption: the custodian of it

00:24:10.239 --> 00:24:15.278
Caption: but arguably we are all custodians

00:24:13.359 --> 00:24:17.439
Caption: every person who has a hand in building

00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:20.159
Caption: technology has some responsibility to

00:24:17.439 --> 00:24:22.558
Caption: the outcomes of those digital systems

00:24:20.159 --> 00:24:24.320
Caption: the internet is a shared resource like

00:24:22.558 --> 00:24:26.000
Caption: an environmental one

00:24:24.319 --> 00:24:26.959
Caption: like food or

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.359
Caption: water

00:24:26.959 --> 00:24:31.839
Caption: and perverse incentives like limitless

00:24:29.359 --> 00:24:34.239
Caption: growth and mining human behavior for

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:35.760
Caption: profit can be antithetical to a world

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:37.439
Caption: that wants to enhance collective

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.678
Caption: well-being

00:24:37.439 --> 00:24:41.918
Caption: in the book future histories lizzie

00:24:39.678 --> 00:24:43.918
Caption: oshie talks a little about drawing on

00:24:41.918 --> 00:24:47.119
Caption: the works of indigenous activists to

00:24:43.918 --> 00:24:49.359
Caption: create better digital futures she says

00:24:47.119 --> 00:24:51.599
Caption: we need to create a digital environment

00:24:49.359 --> 00:24:54.158
Caption: that is not owned by anyone or any

00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:56.239
Caption: entity but is preserved and protected

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:58.480
Caption: for a shared future based on a culture

00:24:56.239 --> 00:25:00.479
Caption: of mutual respect

00:24:58.479 --> 00:25:01.439
Caption: this is a sentiment that i carry into my

00:25:00.479 --> 00:25:02.719
Caption: own work

00:25:01.439 --> 00:25:04.239
Caption: but i think it has the chance to

00:25:02.719 --> 00:25:07.760
Caption: proliferate through the networks and

00:25:04.239 --> 00:25:09.839
Caption: shared infrastructures of our industry

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.839
Caption: so these are some of the viewpoints and

00:25:09.839 --> 00:25:13.439
Caption: protocols that i&#39;m beginning to embed

00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:15.839
Caption: into my own practices of building

00:25:13.439 --> 00:25:15.839
Caption: technology

00:25:16.159 --> 00:25:20.960
Caption: and as i&#39;m learning how to build more

00:25:18.719 --> 00:25:23.678
Caption: diverse teams as well

00:25:20.959 --> 00:25:26.239
Caption: and i want to leave you with some notes

00:25:23.678 --> 00:25:28.319
Caption: about creating space for indigenous

00:25:26.239 --> 00:25:30.400
Caption: technologists on your teams if you

00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:32.639
Caption: manage to find any

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.799
Caption: and good luck so aboriginal and torres

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.440
Caption: strait islander peoples make up roughly

00:25:34.798 --> 00:25:39.760
Caption: three percent of the general population

00:25:37.439 --> 00:25:41.519
Caption: and closer to zero percent of the tech

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.558
Caption: industry

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.440
Caption: we

00:25:42.558 --> 00:25:47.918
Caption: think the number is sitting around 100

00:25:45.439 --> 00:25:50.000
Caption: software developers in australia

00:25:47.918 --> 00:25:51.519
Caption: and i think i probably know all of them

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.558
Caption: by name

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.479
Caption: so

00:25:52.558 --> 00:25:56.798
Caption: good luck um

00:25:54.479 --> 00:25:58.558
Caption: building a diverse team by throwing a

00:25:56.798 --> 00:26:00.079
Caption: bunch of differently experienced people

00:25:58.558 --> 00:26:02.000
Caption: into a room isn&#39;t

00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:04.558
Caption: necessarily sufficient to building

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.119
Caption: ethical technology but also it&#39;s

00:26:04.558 --> 00:26:09.599
Caption: important to create safe space

00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:12.798
Caption: and not all spaces are made equal

00:26:09.599 --> 00:26:14.959
Caption: we may leverage tools and platforms like

00:26:12.798 --> 00:26:16.959
Caption: twitter and facebook and instagram to

00:26:14.959 --> 00:26:18.239
Caption: find our mates but that isn&#39;t their

00:26:16.959 --> 00:26:20.319
Caption: business model

00:26:18.239 --> 00:26:21.599
Caption: these platforms are more like data farms

00:26:20.319 --> 00:26:23.359
Caption: that also happen to be good at

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:25.520
Caption: connecting people so when we&#39;re

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:28.079
Caption: navigating our teams in this industry

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.479
Caption: using digital tools designed to extract

00:26:28.079 --> 00:26:32.719
Caption: and conquer sovereignty is already

00:26:30.479 --> 00:26:35.119
Caption: something to be reclaimed rather than

00:26:32.719 --> 00:26:37.359
Caption: baked into its scaffolding

00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:39.839
Caption: we need spaces that not only serve us

00:26:37.359 --> 00:26:41.760
Caption: but protect us too

00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:44.400
Caption: and the culturally safe space is one

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.000
Caption: where we can find appropriate support

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.000
Caption: a space where people can ask for help

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.159
Caption: from members of their own community and

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.400
Caption: know the support we receive will be

00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:54.400
Caption: culturally relevant

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.479
Caption: the cultural shock waves of the black

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.559
Caption: lives matter movements across the us

00:26:56.479 --> 00:27:00.479
Caption: which have reverberated into our own

00:26:58.558 --> 00:27:02.959
Caption: reflection of australia&#39;s treatment of

00:27:00.479 --> 00:27:05.439
Caption: first nations people have carried with a

00:27:02.959 --> 00:27:08.319
Caption: swarm of well-meaning allies who want to

00:27:05.439 --> 00:27:10.079
Caption: do more to support us but please don&#39;t

00:27:08.319 --> 00:27:12.079
Caption: expect indigenous peoples to be your

00:27:10.079 --> 00:27:14.719
Caption: personal educators when reckoning with

00:27:12.079 --> 00:27:16.558
Caption: your own journey

00:27:14.719 --> 00:27:17.839
Caption: and this particularly includes expecting

00:27:16.558 --> 00:27:19.520
Caption: aboriginal and torres strait islander

00:27:17.839 --> 00:27:22.000

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:24.000

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.719

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.599
Caption: matters of cultural protocols

00:27:26.719 --> 00:27:32.158

00:27:29.599 --> 00:27:34.000
Caption: entitlement when it comes to culture

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:35.360
Caption: there&#39;s this western view that stories

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.520
Caption: are meant to be told

00:27:35.359 --> 00:27:39.599
Caption: and culture is meant to be shared but we

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.000
Caption: have our own very sacred protocols to

00:27:39.599 --> 00:27:44.079
Caption: navigate when engaging with culture

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.839
Caption: who to ask permission from

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:48.000
Caption: which stories are allowed to be told

00:27:45.839 --> 00:27:49.839
Caption: with which kind of people and

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.159
Caption: negotiating who has access to the

00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:55.760

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:56.880
Caption: to preserving their integrity

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.239

00:28:02.079 --> 00:28:05.760
Caption: the tech industry it&#39;s more of a

00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:07.199
Caption: rounding error really

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.039
Caption: and there&#39;s something about knowledge

00:28:07.199 --> 00:28:11.359
Caption: systems that have successfully

00:28:09.038 --> 00:28:13.519

00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:16.479

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:19.200

00:28:16.479 --> 00:28:21.439
Caption: bringing a multitude of experiences and

00:28:19.199 --> 00:28:23.678

00:28:21.439 --> 00:28:25.038

00:28:25.038 --> 00:28:28.959
