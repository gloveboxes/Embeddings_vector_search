  "description": "VS Code is hot, there\u0027s no doubt about it being an utterly amazing editor, but I ask you, are you using it to its full potential? Let\u0027s go on a journey together and look to unlock the real power that you can get out of VS Code. Whether it\u0027s with shortcuts or extensions, environment standardisation and remote development, collaboration to integrations, there\u0027s so many things to uncover that can take you from a user to a pro in no time.\\n\\nThis session will leave you itching to get back into your editor and code up a storm on that next piece of work.\\n\\nNo experience necessary\\n45 mins\\nCore/Non Technical Skills\\nAaron is a Developer Advocate at Microsoft. Having spent 15 years doing web development he\u0027s seen it all, from browser wars, the rise of AJAX and the fall of 20 JavaScript frameworks (and that was just yesterday!). Always tinkering with something new he explores crazy ideas like writing your own implementation of numbers in .NET, creating IoC in JavaScript or implementing tic-tac-toe using git commits."
