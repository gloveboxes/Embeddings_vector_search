00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.879
Caption: good afternoon everyone i hope you&#39;re

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Caption: enjoying ddd perth&#39;s day my name is vidu

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:22.879
Caption: bhardwaj and i&#39;m an i.t lecturer

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.359
Caption: and teaches future workforce so while

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:26.879
Caption: bringing me while being with my students

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:29.840
Caption: from different levels like search

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:32.959
Caption: research for diploma advanced diploma i

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.279
Caption: observed some factors which affect their

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:37.279
Caption: learning ability which affects their

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:40.639
Caption: ability to retain knowledge and some

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:42.479
Caption: factors which affect their behavior so

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:45.119
Caption: because same students are going to end

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:47.520
Caption: up as it professionals so i believe same

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:49.360
Caption: factors would work there so today i&#39;m

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.000
Caption: going to share that

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.319
Caption: such factors and strategy which can help

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.759
Caption: to embed cyber security into business

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.759
Caption: culture

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:59.680
Caption: before we start i would like to

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:02.398
Caption: acknowledge the traditional custodians

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.520
Caption: of this land logic people of the ningar

00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:06.239
Caption: nation

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.639
Caption: and a big thanks to all our amazing

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:09.599
Caption: sponsors

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:11.199
Caption: so

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:14.000
Caption: for embedding cyber security into your

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:16.639
Caption: business culture i will be focusing on

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.080
Caption: these three areas why what and how

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.798
Caption: but major

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.240
Caption: uh discussion will be around how but how

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.000
Caption: we can do that

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:26.639
Caption: but we still need to go through why in

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.199
Caption: what

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:32.000
Caption: so i believe you all know that

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:34.639
Caption: why cyber security is so important

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.119
Caption: but why is it so important to embed that

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:37.919
Caption: into business culture

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.319
Caption: so

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:42.639
Caption: there&#39;s lots of research going around

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.119
Caption: this area and i have some stats to share

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.119
Caption: with you

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:48.399
Caption: 90

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:52.078
Caption: of cyber security incidents

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.919
Caption: are human-enabled so that&#39;s a big number

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.479
Caption: which cannot be ignored and should not

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:58.478
Caption: be avoided

00:01:56.478 --> 00:02:00.078
Caption: also according to another report the

00:01:58.478 --> 00:02:02.639
Caption: most common methods of deploying

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:06.079
Caption: ransomware are

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:09.119
Caption: poor user practices 25

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:12.400
Caption: weak passwords 30 percent

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.919
Caption: lack of cyber security training 36

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:17.679
Caption: and spam phishing email 67

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:20.000
Caption: so these are the top four methods they

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.199
Caption: were more but i just took the top four

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.800
Caption: methods which

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.598
Caption: people used to

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.720
Caption: uh

00:02:23.598 --> 00:02:29.679
Caption: used for a ransom attack now what is a

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.518
Caption: common thing among these four

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:34.159
Caption: points these four

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:35.598
Caption: methods can you can anyone guess what&#39;s

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.680
Caption: the common

00:02:35.598 --> 00:02:39.679
Caption: thing in these among these four

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.199
Caption: absolutely yes so

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:46.878
Caption: human beings so we as human are

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:49.360
Caption: unpredictable

00:02:46.878 --> 00:02:51.119
Caption: like whether we can

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.000
Caption: guess but we cannot be hundred percent

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.159
Caption: sure

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.639
Caption: and yes we are sensitive to

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.839
Caption: emotions play a big role when it comes

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:02.958
Caption: to social engineering so we tend to get

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:05.518
Caption: trapped with emotions so that&#39;s why

00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:07.279
Caption: that&#39;s the reason that many phishing

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:09.199
Caption: emails are successful

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:12.399
Caption: many uh social engineering acts are

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:14.800
Caption: successful so this is the big area we

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:16.319
Caption: cannot ignore this factor of cyber

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.120
Caption: security

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.958
Caption: now

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:21.839
Caption: how companies are controlling this

00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:23.679
Caption: scenario what they are using what helps

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:25.199
Caption: them to establish a security-minded

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:27.518
Caption: business culture

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:30.479
Caption: well many companies have some sort of

00:03:27.518 --> 00:03:32.319
Caption: program in place which they use to

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.559
Caption: make their employees or team members

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.518
Caption: aware of cyber security

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:40.399
Caption: but in academic language we can

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:42.559
Caption: uh say it&#39;s called sata or cyber set up

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:45.518
Caption: cyber security education training and

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:47.679
Caption: awareness now i&#39;m not going into detail

00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:49.679
Caption: of this

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:51.279
Caption: program but

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:52.319
Caption: i would like to ask you certain

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:55.199
Caption: questions

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:58.158
Caption: so that you can analyze whatever program

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:01.360
Caption: or training model you have in place

00:03:58.158 --> 00:04:04.080
Caption: you can create critically analyze it so

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.919
Caption: think about it is it just a checklist

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.279
Caption: do you just do it for the sake of doing

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.679
Caption: it

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:12.158
Caption: is it engaging enough

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:15.279
Caption: how often do you do that

00:04:12.158 --> 00:04:17.279
Caption: and are you sure it is working

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:20.320
Caption: so think about it

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:22.399
Caption: but we will i will share what you can do

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.639
Caption: to make it better

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:26.399
Caption: so how to embed cyber security into your

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.960
Caption: business culture how to do it that&#39;s

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:33.040
Caption: what we&#39;re going to discuss today

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:33.839
Caption: but before that how not to do it

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.919
Caption: so

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:39.519
Caption: these are some headlines from recent

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.839
Caption: news a railway company

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:44.799
Caption: sent fake bonus email to your employees

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:47.359
Caption: to check their cyber awareness

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:50.638
Caption: another company godaddy

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:52.638
Caption: announced a surprise holiday bonus

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.800
Caption: and there was one more company which

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.839
Caption: promised even covid vaccines can you

00:04:54.799 --> 00:05:00.879
Caption: believe this is big no no

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:02.720
Caption: they may with such acts they may get to

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.399
Caption: test their cyber awareness of the

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.600
Caption: employees but they&#39;re definitely going

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:07.199
Caption: to

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.759
Caption: destroy the trust

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.160
Caption: which we cannot afford because as we

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.759
Caption: know humans are or our employees are the

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.600
Caption: front line when it comes to cyber

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:19.600
Caption: security so

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.160
Caption: have to be mindful with such acts

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.800
Caption: so useful tactics so these are going to

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.600
Caption: be the main takeaways from my today&#39;s

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:27.599
Caption: presentation

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:31.198
Caption: training

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:34.320
Caption: that&#39;s the

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:37.360
Caption: that&#39;s the main module which we deliver

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.720
Caption: in our organizations so

00:05:37.359 --> 00:05:40.879
Caption: very important that it should be

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.559
Caption: customized so if you are getting it from

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.199
Caption: somewhere you&#39;re buying it from

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:46.880
Caption: somewhere or you are asking someone to

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.039
Caption: build it for your company make sure it

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.119
Caption: is according to your business needs it

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.559
Caption: should be customized as per the nature

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:54.160
Caption: of your

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:55.679
Caption: organizational

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.239
Caption: structure

00:05:55.679 --> 00:06:00.319
Caption: and has to be in small chunks so it&#39;s

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:02.479
Caption: human tendency that they cannot retain

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:04.799
Caption: knowledge if it is

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:06.639
Caption: overloaded so again this i have observed

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:09.198
Caption: from my own experience

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.039
Caption: if we give some information in small

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.919
Caption: chunks the ability to retain that

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.759
Caption: knowledge gets higher and they get some

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.800
Caption: time to digest the information in

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:19.039
Caption: between

00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:21.839
Caption: handouts help as well

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:24.799
Caption: next it has to be inclusive so there

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:26.799
Caption: might be people who are non i who are

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:29.039
Caption: from non-iit background people may be at

00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:32.239
Caption: reception or someone who&#39;s just taking

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.959
Caption: care of asset so make sure you have you

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:36.880
Caption: train them as well you make them as part

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:39.839
Caption: of your cyber security training or cyber

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.639
Caption: awareness training right so don&#39;t

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:44.639
Caption: exclude anyone

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.080
Caption: simple reporting system

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.960
Caption: very important

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:51.519
Caption: so make sure your employees or team

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:53.679
Caption: members know how to report any potential

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:54.799
Caption: incident any potential cyber security

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:57.440
Caption: incident or

00:06:54.799 --> 00:07:00.000
Caption: if they if any cyber attack happens or

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.199
Caption: anything like that they should know how

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.399
Caption: to report

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.639
Caption: whom to report

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:06.639
Caption: and such system should be simple and

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:09.679
Caption: quick

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:11.679
Caption: really going to impact law

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:13.839
Caption: now once you have trained it&#39;s very

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:16.319
Caption: important that you remind them about it

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:19.199
Caption: regularly so regular reminders should be

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:20.559
Caption: there it can be using um

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:23.360
Caption: tools like

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:25.759
Caption: uh cross departmental talks or having it

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:28.079
Caption: as standing agenda standing item on

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.160
Caption: meeting agendas like we have whs as

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:32.799
Caption: standing item on our general meetings

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.759
Caption: the same way we can discuss this in

00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:38.399
Caption: every meeting so that everyone

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.759
Caption: stay away and stay alert

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:42.720
Caption: another tool you can use is

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:44.720
Caption: e-newsletters really handy because

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.919
Caption: every day something new happens in cyber

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.598
Caption: security world so you should

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:51.279
Caption: share this with your employees with your

00:07:49.598 --> 00:07:54.319
Caption: team members

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:57.679
Caption: again cross department

00:07:54.319 --> 00:08:00.079
Caption: talks should be there on such

00:07:57.679 --> 00:08:02.000
Caption: incidents so easy to e-newsletters are

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:04.159
Caption: very handy and they are always there in

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.279
Caption: your phone in an email

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.759
Caption: and

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:10.720
Caption: last but not the least set an example so

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:12.479
Caption: if you yourself are

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.959
Caption: always talking about it always staying

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:16.000
Caption: aware of it and uh

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:18.239
Caption: people will

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.479
Caption: will see that how you are treating cyber

00:08:18.239 --> 00:08:22.959
Caption: cyber security and they will get

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:25.759
Caption: inspired from you so that

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:27.759
Caption: really makes a difference

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:29.598
Caption: now very important that after you have

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:31.519
Caption: conducted all these things you have put

00:08:29.598 --> 00:08:32.718
Caption: so much effort it&#39;s really important

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:35.760
Caption: that you get to know whether it&#39;s

00:08:32.718 --> 00:08:37.919
Caption: working or not so you can do testing but

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.958
Caption: you have to be very careful you know why

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:43.278
Caption: like we just discussed so tools can be

00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.559
Caption: used like service before and after

00:08:43.278 --> 00:08:47.599
Caption: training

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:49.838
Caption: and regular audits these can be in the

00:08:47.599 --> 00:08:52.838
Caption: form of phishing email attacks but do

00:08:49.838 --> 00:08:54.398
Caption: not promise anything

00:08:52.838 --> 00:08:56.719
Caption: gamification

00:08:54.398 --> 00:08:59.200
Caption: so uh you can

00:08:56.719 --> 00:09:00.958
Caption: entertain and get entertained and get

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.359
Caption: tested uh

00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:05.760
Caption: using the game so i believe

00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:08.159
Caption: it won&#39;t be a big task for

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.398
Caption: game developers or software developers

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:12.639
Caption: so this is kind of

00:09:10.398 --> 00:09:13.919
Caption: uh different ways through which you can

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.720
Caption: check your

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:19.440
Caption: cyber awareness program

00:09:16.719 --> 00:09:22.799
Caption: now there is a difference between

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.760
Caption: cyber aware and cyber culture

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:27.679
Caption: so because we want that uh to be

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.080
Caption: embedded into cyber culture it is very

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:32.320
Caption: important that it comes from within so

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.640
Caption: all these points if they are there

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.200
Caption: they&#39;re definitely going to stay alert

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.359
Caption: and they will always

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.040
Caption: talk about it and it will be there in

00:09:39.359 --> 00:09:44.079
Caption: their mind and they will be very

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:48.398
Caption: cautious before clicking any

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:51.519
Caption: link or any suspicious activity

00:09:48.398 --> 00:09:54.159
Caption: last but not least acknowledgement again

00:09:51.518 --> 00:09:56.159
Caption: from my own experience i observe that

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:57.599
Caption: people tend to perform better when they

00:09:56.159 --> 00:10:00.239
Caption: are acknowledged when they are

00:09:57.599 --> 00:10:02.159
Caption: recognized so after doing the test you

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:04.239
Caption: need to give them constructive feedback

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:06.398
Caption: so that they get to know how they are

00:10:04.239 --> 00:10:08.559
Caption: going and what area they need to improve

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:10.958
Caption: on and

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:12.958
Caption: you can

00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:15.278
Caption: discuss all the points with them it

00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:17.838
Caption: builds trust as well

00:10:15.278 --> 00:10:19.919
Caption: you can also give some rewards

00:10:17.838 --> 00:10:22.078
Caption: on identifying any potential threat so

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:24.239
Caption: rewards can be in any form like a coffee

00:10:22.078 --> 00:10:25.359
Caption: mug or a t-shirt which says

00:10:24.239 --> 00:10:26.799
Caption: um

00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:28.159
Caption: cyber aware

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:31.200
Caption: employee of the month or something like

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:34.000
Caption: that so you can be innovative here

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.958
Caption: now all these points looks very simple

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.958
Caption: but they are very impactful so i really

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:41.359
Caption: want that you should

00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:43.760
Caption: implement these points in your existing

00:10:41.359 --> 00:10:44.958
Caption: cyber awareness program if you have any

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.518
Caption: or you are

00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:49.919
Caption: trying to get a new program or

00:10:47.518 --> 00:10:51.200
Caption: such system in place

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:53.679
Caption: so

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.600
Caption: in summary i would say that to embed

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:58.559
Caption: cyber security business culture you need

00:10:55.599 --> 00:11:01.119
Caption: to have a customized program which is

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:03.278
Caption: inclusive engaging and should not

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:06.640
Caption: destroy trust so

00:11:03.278 --> 00:11:09.200
Caption: keep all these things in mind now um
