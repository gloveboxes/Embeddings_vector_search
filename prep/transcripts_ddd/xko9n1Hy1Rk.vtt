00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.559
Caption: all right hello everyone uh normally I&#39;d

00:00:05.699 --> 00:00:09.719
Caption: like to be in the crowd a bit more but

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:11.699
Caption: I&#39;ve been told because of the banner and

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.399
Caption: the microphone I have to stay behind the

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:17.399
Caption: lectern uh I&#39;m Karen Larry I&#39;m talking

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:18.959
Caption: about their people not users uh the only

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:20.639
Caption: thing I really you really need to know

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:22.858
Caption: about me for this talk is on the main

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:25.319
Caption: slide and that&#39;s I&#39;m a graphic design

00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:28.680
Caption: lecturer I currently teach sessionally

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:30.959
Caption: at Murdoch University uh teaching in the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.758
Caption: graphic design degree so if you do have

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:34.379
Caption: graduates come through that don&#39;t know

00:00:32.758 --> 00:00:36.599
Caption: what they&#39;re talking about that&#39;s

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.139
Caption: probably my fault

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:38.879
Caption: um

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:40.319
Caption: so I&#39;m just going to give a shout out to

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.540
Caption: all the sponsors that make today

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:44.398
Caption: possible as well as all the volunteers

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.680
Caption: and the committee members who are giving

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:49.199
Caption: their time to put together this great

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.779
Caption: conference for us

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.360
Caption: so today what I want to talk about is

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:57.299
Caption: human centered design and this is a term

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.159
Caption: that&#39;s actually coined by Don Norman Don

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.139
Caption: Norman wrote a really great book called

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.578
Caption: the Design of Everyday Things that I

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:05.099
Caption: highly recommend

00:01:02.578 --> 00:01:07.680
Caption: and he says the goal is to produce a

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:09.839
Caption: great product one that is successful and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.239
Caption: that customers love it can be done

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:14.099
Caption: though this is all about empathy which

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:17.279
Caption: is something that we are familiar with

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:19.680
Caption: many from ux design and we&#39;re looking

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:22.080
Caption: here at putting people first we&#39;re

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.360
Caption: looking past the visuals but unlike what

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.419
Caption: we see in ux design we&#39;re actually also

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.239
Caption: looking past the functionality to focus

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:32.459
Caption: on the thoughts and the feelings of the

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:34.438
Caption: people who are using your app and your

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.360
Caption: product

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.880
Caption: so how do we do that

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.658
Caption: well most of the time we&#39;d start with a

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:45.599
Caption: Persona so let&#39;s meet Ben Ben is a

00:01:42.658 --> 00:01:48.298
Caption: software developer here in Perth he&#39;s

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:51.298
Caption: married he doesn&#39;t have any kids he&#39;s

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.520
Caption: got terrible taste in music and he

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.960
Caption: enjoys rock climbing and running as his

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:57.180
Caption: two Main Hobbies

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:00.478
Caption: once we&#39;ve written our Persona we might

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.639
Caption: make some scenarios and chances are once

00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:05.398
Caption: we&#39;ve written those scenarios the

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:07.319
Caption: language that we use to talk about band

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.020
Caption: changes

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:13.440
Caption: we might find we start using words like

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.238
Caption: user like visitor click subscriber

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.979
Caption: traffic customer the language goes on

00:02:17.238 --> 00:02:22.440
Caption: these words are actually quite

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:25.440
Caption: problematic because they focus

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.139
Caption: themselves on the role of the user when

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.819
Caption: they&#39;re using your product we assign a

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:32.580
Caption: role to them based on that interaction

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.080
Caption: and based on how we intend to profit

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.598
Caption: from them

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.238
Caption: Don Norman who I mentioned coined the

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:41.458
Caption: term Human Experience design is actually

00:02:39.238 --> 00:02:42.899
Caption: the one who coined the term user

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:45.598
Caption: experience design

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:47.939
Caption: and he developed what we call human

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:51.119
Caption: Center design because he also thought

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.819
Caption: these words were quite problematic

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.839
Caption: because Ben is none of those things

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.639
Caption: Ben&#39;s a person

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:58.559
Caption: so the first thing that we really need

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.199
Caption: to be doing here is changing our

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:02.279
Caption: terminology and calling our audience

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.559
Caption: people

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:07.378
Caption: they&#39;re not users they&#39;re not visitors

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:09.779
Caption: and they&#39;re not clicks this is a really

00:03:07.378 --> 00:03:11.518
Caption: small change that we can be making in

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:14.639
Caption: our internal documents in our company

00:03:11.518 --> 00:03:17.580
Caption: but it actually allows us to refocus our

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.878
Caption: team on what&#39;s important and that&#39;s this

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.279
Caption: big messy complicated experience that we

00:03:20.878 --> 00:03:26.940
Caption: call being human and the fact that your

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:29.518
Caption: app&#39;s only one small part of that

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.878
Caption: because let&#39;s face it being human is

00:03:29.518 --> 00:03:34.018
Caption: complicated just look at Ben Ben screws

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:37.018
Caption: up a lot

00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:39.360
Caption: do you really think you can account for

00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:42.539
Caption: all of the different ways Ben manages to

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.518
Caption: screw up on an almost daily basis

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:46.919
Caption: Ben is lazy

00:03:44.518 --> 00:03:49.018
Caption: Ben doesn&#39;t like having to get up in the

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:51.479
Caption: mornings he&#39;ll often leave for work at

00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:53.819
Caption: the last possible moment he&#39;s

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:55.679
Caption: unpredictable not even his wife can

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.839
Caption: sometimes predict some of the behavior

00:03:55.679 --> 00:04:00.958
Caption: that he manages in the decisions that he

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:03.598
Caption: makes he&#39;s very complex like most of us

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:05.940
Caption: Ben will often believe in contradictory

00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:07.860
Caption: things at the same time and get a very

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.559
Caption: heated arguments about them

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.180
Caption: Ben also wastes a lot of time he&#39;ll

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.798
Caption: spend a lot of time on his phone

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:16.738
Caption: browsing Reddit

00:04:13.798 --> 00:04:19.859
Caption: a lot of time watching TV

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.620
Caption: when we use language like visitor like

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.559
Caption: user we are suggesting that there&#39;s a

00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:28.139
Caption: such thing as an ideal user for our app

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:31.019
Caption: and there is no ideal user that doesn&#39;t

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.300
Caption: exist we don&#39;t know the situation Ben&#39;s

00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:35.879
Caption: going to be in when he uses our app we

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:38.638
Caption: don&#39;t know the environment we don&#39;t know

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.580
Caption: how he&#39;s going to be thinking or feeling

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.940
Caption: so we really need to be thinking about

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:47.698
Caption: how we can change this terminology and

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.679
Caption: think of Ben as being human because if

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.839
Caption: we don&#39;t do this Ben&#39;s going to find our

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:54.059
Caption: app really frustrating to use

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:55.559
Caption: and when Ben gets frustrated when he

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:58.559
Caption: does screw up

00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:01.500
Caption: it&#39;s not Ben&#39;s fault Ben&#39;s very good at

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:04.019
Caption: blaming other people it&#39;ll always be

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.839
Caption: your fault as the designer

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:09.899
Caption: a way around this as I tell my students

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:13.019
Caption: when I&#39;m teaching is to ask why

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:15.359
Caption: you want to ask why five times is a

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:17.519
Caption: guide that I give my students and we do

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:19.978
Caption: this because human error is never the

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:21.959
Caption: answer if the answer you&#39;ve come up with

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.940
Caption: is that it&#39;s Ben&#39;s fault you have to

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:25.559
Caption: keep digging because Ben will not accept

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.720
Caption: the blank

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:30.000
Caption: you need to look beyond the feature that

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.779
Caption: Ben&#39;s gotten stuck at and look at the

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.320
Caption: problem with the system itself

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:38.459
Caption: because Ben cares about a lot more than

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.100
Caption: your product

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:43.380
Caption: so we need to look beyond the product

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.339
Caption: itself beyond the features that you&#39;ve

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.559
Caption: developed

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:48.479
Caption: Ben himself he cares about climate

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:50.579
Caption: change he&#39;s quite concerned about the

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.919
Caption: world he&#39;s very aware given he&#39;s a

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:55.258
Caption: developer about how his data is being

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:58.740
Caption: used and about the kinds of commissions

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:01.259
Caption: that he&#39;s granting the apps that he uses

00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:03.599
Caption: Ben&#39;s much less likely to use your app

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.699
Caption: if it&#39;s not ethical

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.979
Caption: now I&#39;m going to put a little asterisk

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:10.739
Caption: here because human-centered design

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.839
Caption: doesn&#39;t have to be ethical and we see

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:15.000
Caption: plenty of examples that aren&#39;t

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:17.579
Caption: but human-centered design is about

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.799
Caption: focusing on the experience and creating

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:23.758
Caption: a positive experience for people using

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:26.638
Caption: your app so it should always be ethical

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:29.100
Caption: and when we&#39;re talking about ethics what

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.559
Caption: we&#39;re really talking about is the

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.720
Caption: respect that you have for your users

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:36.119
Caption: people are more aware now than ever

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.819
Caption: before thanks to shows like the social

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:41.519
Caption: Dilemma on Netflix about the social

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:44.100
Caption: responsibility the people making their

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:46.440
Caption: media should have

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.479
Caption: so the very first element we need to

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.360
Caption: consider when we&#39;re talking about ethics

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.639
Caption: is human rights making sure that you

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:56.939
Caption: protect the fundamental human rights

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:59.460
Caption: that your app has so when looking here

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.080
Caption: about your social responsibility at the

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:02.880
Caption: very core

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:06.418
Caption: you want to make sure your app is

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.479
Caption: transparent accessible and sustainable

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.220
Caption: so you don&#39;t want to deceive users a

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.539
Caption: really good example of this is the

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.059
Caption: Twitter Bluetick

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:16.919
Caption: when we see a blue tick on Twitter we

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:20.039
Caption: often see it as holding some kind of

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:22.979
Caption: power we see it as representing a status

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:25.019
Caption: symbol of power and recognition no one

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:26.940
Caption: has really exemplified this more than

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:29.399
Caption: the way people have reacted to Donald

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:33.419
Caption: Trump on Twitter before he got banned

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:35.819
Caption: the Blue Tick actually just recognizes a

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:38.459
Caption: high profile user it stops other people

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:40.979
Caption: from impersonating them that&#39;s all that

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:44.220
Caption: does but the decision that Twitter made

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:46.440
Caption: to use a tick as a symbol very much

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.779
Caption: changes the reaction we have as an

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:52.559
Caption: audience to that symbol

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:54.720
Caption: we want to also be transparent in an

00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:57.598
Caption: upfront about the purchases people might

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.179
Caption: need to make in our products we know not

00:07:57.598 --> 00:08:02.399
Caption: we&#39;ve all heard of microtransactions EA

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:06.839
Caption: games made the news a few years ago in

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:09.179
Caption: 2018 2017 over microtransactions

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:10.139
Caption: the microtransaction industry is still

00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:14.519
Caption: massive

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:16.860
Caption: in 2021 it was worth 60 billion dollars

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:20.098
Caption: so there&#39;s definitely a lot of money to

00:08:16.859 --> 00:08:22.378
Caption: be made here but is it ethical EA Games

00:08:20.098 --> 00:08:24.959
Caption: had developed what they called loot

00:08:22.378 --> 00:08:28.559
Caption: boxes as a way to advance faster in

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:30.479
Caption: their games we saw Belgium in 2018 ban

00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:33.658
Caption: these loot boxes as a form of gambling

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:35.820
Caption: that actually got overturned briefly and

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:37.919
Caption: it got overturned Because the actual

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.739
Caption: legislation that defined what gambling

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:43.919
Caption: is didn&#39;t cover this form of in-game

00:08:40.739 --> 00:08:45.898
Caption: purchases in apps but while the law

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.239
Caption: wasn&#39;t really up to speed and still

00:08:45.898 --> 00:08:50.458
Caption: isn&#39;t in many countries around our use

00:08:48.239 --> 00:08:53.458
Caption: of microtransactions

00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:56.940
Caption: it doesn&#39;t make it ethical do we really

00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:59.119
Caption: want our kids and our teens in these

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:02.820
Caption: apps potentially with your credit card

00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:05.820
Caption: making these uh purchases and learning

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:09.000
Caption: from a really young age to gamble rather

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:11.160
Caption: than putting in the effort for gameplay

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.559
Caption: your product should also aim to reduce

00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:16.319
Caption: inequality which is a really important

00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:18.958
Caption: aspect of Human Rights this comes down

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.958
Caption: to learnability thinking about how easy

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:23.700
Caption: it is for first-time users and also that

00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:26.778
Caption: dreaded word that I&#39;m sure we all find

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:29.880
Caption: frustrated with at times compatibility

00:09:26.778 --> 00:09:32.659
Caption: making sure it works backwards across

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.660
Caption: different devices

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:38.518
Caption: our next element is respecting human

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:41.099
Caption: effort so your app should be functional

00:09:38.518 --> 00:09:43.859
Caption: it should also be trustworthy and

00:09:41.099 --> 00:09:45.898
Caption: reliable you want to respect the effort

00:09:43.859 --> 00:09:46.859
Caption: that we&#39;re actually putting into using

00:09:45.898 --> 00:09:50.219
Caption: your app

00:09:46.859 --> 00:09:52.559
Caption: so you want to respect privacy here you

00:09:50.219 --> 00:09:54.958
Caption: want to only collect information from

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:57.719
Caption: your from the people that are using your

00:09:54.958 --> 00:10:00.479
Caption: app that&#39;s absolutely necessary to be

00:09:57.719 --> 00:10:02.518
Caption: using it we are more aware than ever as

00:10:00.479 --> 00:10:06.000
Caption: I said about the kinds of permissions

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:08.940
Caption: that we&#39;re granting when we use apps

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.799
Caption: you also want to think about the extent

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.659
Caption: to which you as a designer or a

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:15.299
Caption: developer are actually going to

00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:17.699
Caption: influence the behavior of the people who

00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:20.039
Caption: use your app a really good example from

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:24.299
Caption: of this comes from a book called stolen

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:26.278
Caption: focus by Johann Hari this book looks at

00:10:24.299 --> 00:10:28.859
Caption: the different ways that our attention

00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:31.799
Caption: spans have actually reduced and it just

00:10:28.859 --> 00:10:34.820
Caption: looks at ways Beyond just technology and

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:36.958
Caption: Beyond social media but it does have

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:40.260
Caption: understandably quite a few chapters

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:42.778
Caption: about social media and in it Johann

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.799
Caption: talks about the creator of the scroll

00:10:42.778 --> 00:10:45.719
Caption: feed

00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:47.820
Caption: and says that the creator of the scroll

00:10:45.719 --> 00:10:50.278
Caption: feed actually deeply regretted his

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.679
Caption: decision and being a part of this

00:10:50.278 --> 00:10:56.219
Caption: creation and it did what it was supposed

00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:58.559
Caption: to it allowed kept people on on the app

00:10:56.219 --> 00:11:01.078
Caption: it kept people there for longer allowing

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:03.179
Caption: them to collect more data sell more ads

00:11:01.078 --> 00:11:05.518
Caption: and make more money but it didn&#39;t

00:11:03.179 --> 00:11:07.440
Caption: respect effort that people were putting

00:11:05.518 --> 00:11:09.958
Caption: into being in that app

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.059
Caption: We compare this to Netflix

00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:14.640
Caption: Netflix after you&#39;ve watched a few

00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:16.679
Caption: episodes gives you a notification asking

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.898
Caption: if you&#39;re still there it is thanks to

00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:21.859
Caption: this notification that Ben makes it to

00:11:18.898 --> 00:11:21.859
Caption: bed on time at night

00:11:22.018 --> 00:11:27.719
Caption: so the last aspect we&#39;ve got is where we

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.700
Caption: really see this link with human-centered

00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:32.639
Caption: design and that&#39;s creating positive

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.619
Caption: experiences this is about the emotional

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.898
Caption: connection people have with your product

00:11:34.619 --> 00:11:40.799
Caption: it should be delightful it should be

00:11:36.898 --> 00:11:43.979
Caption: intuitive and it should be invisible if

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:46.260
Caption: your app works well I shouldn&#39;t notice

00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:48.719
Caption: the interactions I&#39;m having in it it

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.940
Caption: should be that easy to use if I&#39;m having

00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:53.359
Caption: to think about it you&#39;ve done something

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.359
Caption: wrong

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.200
Caption: now we can&#39;t consider ethics without

00:11:56.159 --> 00:12:00.359
Caption: also considering the wider Community

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.540
Caption: because Ben is part of the bigger

00:12:00.359 --> 00:12:06.419
Caption: Community our design has to focus on the

00:12:03.539 --> 00:12:09.119
Caption: entire activity under consideration not

00:12:06.419 --> 00:12:11.219
Caption: just the smaller components you have and

00:12:09.119 --> 00:12:14.398
Caption: this is a reason why we all have terms

00:12:11.219 --> 00:12:16.739
Caption: like feature creep in our terminology

00:12:14.398 --> 00:12:18.479
Caption: Ben is part of a much bigger system than

00:12:16.739 --> 00:12:22.320
Caption: your app he&#39;s part of the software

00:12:18.479 --> 00:12:25.380
Caption: Community here in wa and in Australia we

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.898
Caption: need to be sensitive to the history and

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.578
Caption: the culture and the beliefs of the

00:12:27.898 --> 00:12:32.278
Caption: structures in the community that we&#39;re

00:12:29.578 --> 00:12:34.679
Caption: designing for and you can&#39;t do this on

00:12:32.278 --> 00:12:37.320
Caption: your own even if you have a team of

00:12:34.679 --> 00:12:39.778
Caption: people whose job this is you cannot do

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.119
Caption: this on your own you need to be talking

00:12:39.778 --> 00:12:44.518
Caption: to the community that are going to be

00:12:42.119 --> 00:12:46.919
Caption: involved in your app

00:12:44.518 --> 00:12:49.679
Caption: which means you can&#39;t just talk to Ben

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:51.778
Caption: Ben is very privileged Ben is white and

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:54.179
Caption: male Ben has no ongoing health

00:12:51.778 --> 00:12:56.700
Caption: conditions Ben&#39;s got a full-time job

00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:58.619
Caption: with a good salary Ben has a bachelor

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.480
Caption: degree he&#39;s paid off his hex debt

00:12:58.619 --> 00:13:04.320
Caption: something I&#39;m sure not many of us can

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:06.958
Caption: say and Ben is heterosexual and married

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.179
Caption: being people-centered means you have to

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:12.059
Caption: consider all of the people who are

00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:14.638
Caption: involved if we use Healthcare as an

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:16.559
Caption: example this means the patience this

00:13:14.638 --> 00:13:18.359
Caption: means the doctors the families the

00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:21.778
Caption: general practitioners Specialists

00:13:18.359 --> 00:13:24.059
Caption: technicians nurses the list goes on you

00:13:21.778 --> 00:13:25.078
Caption: need to think about everybody in that

00:13:24.059 --> 00:13:28.559
Caption: community

00:13:25.078 --> 00:13:31.078
Caption: now how do you actually do this well

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:33.299
Caption: there&#39;s obvious Solutions with

00:13:31.078 --> 00:13:36.659
Caption: connecting with stakeholders doing field

00:13:33.299 --> 00:13:38.820
Caption: interviews setting up meetings and going

00:13:36.659 --> 00:13:41.819
Caption: out and observing in the different

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:44.700
Caption: Industries and this can be costly

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:47.100
Caption: I&#39;d like to note here that it&#39;s not as

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.139
Caption: costly as spending a year developing

00:13:47.099 --> 00:13:51.000
Caption: something that the community doesn&#39;t

00:13:49.138 --> 00:13:53.699
Caption: actually want

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.278
Caption: but you should also consider the ways

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:58.380
Caption: you can use your current channels to be

00:13:56.278 --> 00:14:00.479
Caption: engaging in this process

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.700
Caption: for example I always have an open

00:14:00.479 --> 00:14:06.239
Caption: Communication channel that I invite

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:08.760
Caption: stakeholders to and I can really quickly

00:14:06.239 --> 00:14:11.458
Caption: and easily drop in issues that we&#39;re

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.500
Caption: having questions we might have and keep

00:14:11.458 --> 00:14:15.299
Caption: the community on board with the progress

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.638
Caption: we&#39;re making in the app and those

00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:20.159
Caption: decisions that we&#39;re making so you could

00:14:17.638 --> 00:14:23.338
Caption: even be thinking about here how can you

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:25.559
Caption: repurpose the the technology and the

00:14:23.338 --> 00:14:28.018
Caption: systems already available to you that

00:14:25.559 --> 00:14:30.479
Caption: might mean making a dedicated channel of

00:14:28.018 --> 00:14:33.659
Caption: teams for example where you can invite

00:14:30.479 --> 00:14:37.018
Caption: some key stakeholders for me this part

00:14:33.659 --> 00:14:39.659
Caption: of the process is really important and I

00:14:37.018 --> 00:14:42.239
Caption: couldn&#39;t develop any work without having

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:44.578
Caption: that open Communication channel with the

00:14:42.239 --> 00:14:46.919
Caption: stakeholders involved

00:14:44.578 --> 00:14:49.559
Caption: so I simply put we want to learn about

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:51.239
Caption: the people that we&#39;re designing for and

00:14:49.559 --> 00:14:53.159
Caption: then we want to take time to make sense

00:14:51.239 --> 00:14:54.898
Caption: of what we&#39;ve learned and I&#39;ve got this

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:56.518
Caption: as a separate point because we don&#39;t

00:14:54.898 --> 00:14:58.859
Caption: want to come in with assumptions about

00:14:56.518 --> 00:15:01.320
Caption: who Ben is because Ben&#39;s very

00:14:58.859 --> 00:15:03.898
Caption: unpredictable he&#39;ll surprise us

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.539
Caption: we then want to look at opportunities

00:15:03.898 --> 00:15:08.940
Caption: for how we can Prov improve people&#39;s

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:11.940
Caption: lives and we want to do so ethically

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:14.398
Caption: only then should we start prototyping

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.799
Caption: while maintaining contact with our

00:15:14.398 --> 00:15:19.679
Caption: community stakeholders

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:21.778
Caption: now some of you have caught on Ben is a

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:23.820
Caption: real person he&#39;s my husband and he&#39;s in

00:15:21.778 --> 00:15:26.059
Caption: the front row here so let&#39;s all thank

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.059
Caption: Ben

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:34.458
Caption: I&#39;m not quite sure how I&#39;m going for

00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.458
Caption: time if there&#39;s any time for questions

00:15:38.219 --> 00:15:44.099
Caption: and Ben is uh in uh on just after me by

00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:45.838
Caption: the way in the main theater so that&#39;s

00:15:44.099 --> 00:15:47.819
Caption: been running off to get ready for his

00:15:45.838 --> 00:15:50.820
Caption: talk and Ben will be talking about

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:55.039
Caption: offline mode offline first not offline

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.039
Caption: mode uh in the lecture theater

00:15:56.278 --> 00:16:02.458
Caption: God yeah

00:15:58.338 --> 00:16:04.559
Caption: great talk uh congratulations uh for Ben

00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:08.219
Caption: good sport

00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:10.859
Caption: um uh any tips on how to affect change

00:16:08.219 --> 00:16:13.259
Caption: within an organization on using

00:16:10.859 --> 00:16:16.859
Caption: inclusive language people when it&#39;s so

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:19.139
Caption: ingrained in in that culture absolutely

00:16:16.859 --> 00:16:22.559
Caption: so this can be probably the toughest one

00:16:19.138 --> 00:16:25.559
Caption: I find uh simply so I write a lot of the

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:28.440
Caption: reports myself and I&#39;ll actually use

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:30.599
Caption: inclusive language in the reports that I

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.458
Caption: am making so I very much try to push

00:16:30.599 --> 00:16:35.278
Caption: that from the point of view of the same

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:37.619
Caption: as when I&#39;m in the classroom being the
