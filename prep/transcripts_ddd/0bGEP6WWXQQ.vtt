00:00:02.559 --> 00:00:06.878
Caption: hello everyone my name is rob curley and

00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:07.838
Caption: it&#39;s an absolute pleasure to be with you

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.360
Caption: today

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.000
Caption: and welcome to your first breakout

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:14.479
Caption: session of ddd perth 2021

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.159
Caption: and in this session we&#39;ll be exploring

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:19.760
Caption: what it takes to think like a cto

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.079
Caption: so many of the talks that you&#39;ll see

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.720
Caption: today will cover the myriad new

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.840
Caption: technologies architectures products and

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:29.118
Caption: frameworks that we have available to use

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.760
Caption: this talk&#39;s going to be a little bit

00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:34.398
Caption: different we&#39;re going to be looking at

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.078
Caption: how we give technology purpose how we

00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:41.119
Caption: can derive value from it and how we can

00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:44.878
Caption: assess its suitability to delivering a

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:47.520
Caption: user or business outcomes

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.399
Caption: and the agenda for the next 45 minutes

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.239
Caption: together

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:53.359
Caption: it&#39;s a little bit ambitious we&#39;re going

00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:54.479
Caption: to start with a not so gentle primer uh

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.479
Caption: strategy

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.639
Caption: what&#39;s involved this is great thinking

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:01.439
Caption: tools we have

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:03.840
Caption: and the other areas pertaining to

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:05.040
Caption: being creating a set of decisions of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.799
Caption: folklore

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.959
Caption: within your business for kind of

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.600
Caption: defining how you&#39;ll win

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:13.118
Caption: we&#39;ll also look at personal growth so

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:15.519
Caption: the techniques that you can bring back

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.400
Caption: to your company on monday and start

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:21.519
Caption: applying instantly so whether you be in

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.799
Caption: a leadership role or not

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:26.079
Caption: and we&#39;re going to look at technology

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.640
Caption: strategy from three main perspectives

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.439
Caption: first of all we&#39;ll look at its purpose

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:32.879
Caption: how it relates to broader strategic

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.560
Caption: goals

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:36.399
Caption: with this base level of understanding

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:37.919
Caption: established were they gonna pivot to how

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.239
Caption: to define

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:42.078
Caption: communicate and evolve a technology

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:43.758
Caption: strategy

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.159
Caption: and finally we&#39;re going to look at

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.439
Caption: making decisions one of the critical

00:01:46.158 --> 00:01:52.639
Caption: parts of any strategy how do you turn

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.720
Caption: ideas into decisions and ultimately

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:58.798
Caption: actions that will yield positive

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.799
Caption: outcomes for your users or customers

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.680
Caption: so a little bit about myself i am the

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.000
Caption: head of engineering at fixed technology

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.759
Caption: and at fix we build transport solutions

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.039
Caption: for entire cities

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.479
Caption: so if you&#39;re familiar with the mikey

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.119
Caption: card in melbourne that was one of the

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.878
Caption: previous solutions that we&#39;ve delivered

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:17.199
Caption: before that i was a principal consultant

00:02:14.878 --> 00:02:20.319
Caption: at telstra purple where i worked with

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:24.080
Caption: ctos and cios on defining companies

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.639
Caption: strategic technology strategies

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.238
Caption: i am also a member of the ddd perth

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.440
Caption: committee and i am in absolute awe of my

00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:33.199
Caption: fellow committee members and the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.760
Caption: incredible work they put in to bring

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:38.399
Caption: events like this to the community

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:40.878
Caption: and i&#39;m also available at rob d crowley

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:43.679
Caption: on the socials

00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:47.279
Caption: and i do have a confession to make

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:50.479
Caption: i absolutely love shy d-tech

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:53.039
Caption: but in today&#39;s talk i really hope that i

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:55.440
Caption: can change your perspective about tech

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.839
Caption: technology just a little bit

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.598
Caption: and be able to give you the tools to

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:01.679
Caption: assess whether it&#39;s viable whether it&#39;s

00:02:59.598 --> 00:03:03.518
Caption: the correct choice for the problem at

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:07.039
Caption: hand and the outcome you&#39;re looking to

00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:07.039
Caption: achieve for your customers

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:12.958
Caption: so i&#39;ve used that word strategy quite a

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.158
Caption: few times already

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:18.720
Caption: so what is strategy

00:03:16.158 --> 00:03:20.720
Caption: the one in doubt consult a dictionary

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.360
Caption: and our friends at macquarie dictionary

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.158
Caption: tell us that strategy is a plan of

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.720
Caption: action

00:03:24.158 --> 00:03:30.000
Caption: designed to achieve a long-term aim

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.680
Caption: so we can see a couple of things from

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.878
Caption: this definition

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:34.878
Caption: first we can see it&#39;s about making

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:36.559
Caption: decisions and acting upon them

00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:41.440
Caption: and secondly that this activity is

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:41.440
Caption: performed to achieve a long-term vision

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:46.399
Caption: i&#39;ve just done it again i&#39;ve introduced

00:03:43.518 --> 00:03:49.119
Caption: a new word vision and often

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:51.199
Caption: vision mission purpose

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:52.958
Caption: strategy all of these words are used

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.759
Caption: interchangeably in conversations which

00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.199
Caption: creates a really muddied picture of what

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:59.199
Caption: we&#39;re looking to achieve

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:02.000
Caption: so let&#39;s break them down

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:04.238
Caption: so what is a company&#39;s purpose what&#39;s

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.479
Caption: its vision what&#39;s its mission

00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:08.958
Caption: the purpose is really the why

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:11.518
Caption: why does the company exist

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:13.438
Caption: and at vixx our purpose is to connect

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:16.559
Caption: people and places

00:04:13.438 --> 00:04:19.199
Caption: it forms our true north

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:20.880
Caption: the vision it&#39;s a statement of intent

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.919
Caption: it&#39;s the lighthouse

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.399
Caption: it then

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.839
Caption: marks the statement of intent on the

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:28.079
Caption: positive impact you will make on the

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:30.799
Caption: world so how will the world different

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:33.198
Caption: once you have delivered your work

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:35.279
Caption: the mission is the how so to achieve the

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.479
Caption: vision you need to do some concrete set

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.639
Caption: of actions

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.119
Caption: and this is where strategy comes in

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.360
Caption: the strategy uses the mission

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:44.959
Caption: to achieve the vision

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:46.079
Caption: and that&#39;s very important to be able to

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:47.039
Caption: break them down because the mission

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:50.478
Caption: should be concrete it should be

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.240
Caption: actionable it should be measurable

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.040
Caption: and that then forms the core of the

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:57.039
Caption: strategy so if you&#39;re thinking back

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.360
Caption: actually i&#39;m not the person who sets my

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.240
Caption: company&#39;s purpose or my vision don&#39;t

00:04:59.359 --> 00:05:02.399
Caption: worry

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:04.720
Caption: you can still define an incredible

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:08.359
Caption: strategy that leverages the mission to

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.360
Caption: achieve the vision

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.880
Caption: and the first thing we need to realize

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.279
Caption: about strategy is it cannot live or

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.160
Caption: exist in a vacuum

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:24.479
Caption: without context it is impossible to

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.800
Caption: discern decisions or actions which are

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.559
Caption: harmful or beneficial to the outcomes

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:30.478
Caption: you&#39;re looking to achieve

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:32.799
Caption: we need to look at the context and the

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.119
Caption: environment to which we operate

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:37.839
Caption: and this ability is called situational

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:39.359
Caption: awareness and this is table stakes for

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:41.119
Caption: effective strategy

00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:44.079
Caption: and this is how we can perceive

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:48.000
Caption: assimilate and synthesize inputs from

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:48.000
Caption: the context in which we operate

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.679
Caption: and in this context the environment is

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.679
Caption: the

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.440
Caption: the operating context so the industry

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:04.160
Caption: your organization your competitors all

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.479
Caption: form part of this environment

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.119
Caption: and this is in a constant state of flux

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.559
Caption: and you can&#39;t control this flux

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:16.079
Caption: there&#39;s a global pandemic which has

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:18.639
Caption: undermined many companies strategies

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:20.079
Caption: a competitor could launch a new product

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.639
Caption: that could be a new technology

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:24.399
Caption: innovation that radically changes the

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.919
Caption: environment which you operate

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:29.919
Caption: this is in constant flux so for example

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.319
Caption: the global pandemic was a financial boom

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:35.839
Caption: for companies such as zoom who offer

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:38.639
Caption: video conferencing conversely it hit

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:40.720
Caption: wework&#39;s strategic plan very heavily

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.960
Caption: it still has all of the contracts on its

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.759
Caption: side with the landlords but its own

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:47.279
Caption: internal occupancy plummeted

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.799
Caption: so through no fault of the road a

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:49.759
Caption: strategy that could previously have been

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:53.839
Caption: effective

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.839
Caption: has been undermined or changed radically

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:58.160
Caption: and the ticketing industry is no

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.239
Caption: different

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.399
Caption: the rise of covert has driven cash out

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:03.759
Caption: of a system so contactless or emv being

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:05.839
Caption: able to pay for travel with your smart

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:07.919
Caption: cards has become predominant

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:11.279
Caption: but this is only the status we can

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:12.959
Caption: already see a passion emerging whereby

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:15.199
Caption: the ticketing industry will likely not

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:16.880
Caption: remain standalone for long you could see

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.279
Caption: it being integrated with other services

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.399
Caption: such as parking possibly towards smart

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:23.199
Caption: cities and

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:24.880
Caption: single account based government accounts

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:27.119
Caption: and you can see all of these things

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:30.239
Caption: extrapolate based on this one large

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:32.479
Caption: change to the environment

00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:37.279
Caption: and there&#39;s a key point to make as well

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:40.160
Caption: is that competition drives evolution

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:44.119
Caption: or to restate it without competition

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.119
Caption: stagnation will result

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:51.359
Caption: and companies respond to

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:52.399
Caption: changes in the environment at different

00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:55.119
Caption: paces

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:56.399
Caption: so if you take compute for instance

00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:58.000
Caption: previously we would have had our own

00:07:56.399 --> 00:07:59.919
Caption: data centers that we would have named

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.279
Caption: our servers cute little things like star

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:04.240
Caption: wars characters or simpsons characters

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:06.160
Caption: but then

00:08:04.239 --> 00:08:09.279
Caption: some companies early on

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.639
Caption: said actually we can then use them as

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:14.878
Caption: cattle not pets and they adopted i as so

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:16.878
Caption: ec2

00:08:14.878 --> 00:08:18.559
Caption: but that was only the start of it with

00:08:16.878 --> 00:08:20.959
Caption: the advent of serverless with

00:08:18.559 --> 00:08:23.039
Caption: pay-as-you-go that has gone from being a

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:27.319
Caption: differentiator right the way through to

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:27.319
Caption: a commodity just like electricity

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:31.199
Caption: and as william gibson said the future&#39;s

00:08:29.598 --> 00:08:32.718
Caption: already here is just unevenly

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:35.518
Caption: distributed

00:08:32.718 --> 00:08:36.640
Caption: and companies respond to change

00:08:35.518 --> 00:08:38.958
Caption: differently

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.640
Caption: but you sometimes think the fastest will

00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.640
Caption: be the most successful

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.040
Caption: let&#39;s turn the clock back to the early

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.760
Caption: 1990s and look at a case where being

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:49.679
Caption: first is not necessarily a precursor for

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.080
Caption: success

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:55.039
Caption: so back in the early 90s netscape had

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.080
Caption: about an 80 market share of the browser

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:57.759
Caption: space

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.278
Caption: and it had a single product which is

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.518
Caption: charged for customers and a lot of good

00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:04.080
Caption: will towards it

00:09:01.518 --> 00:09:06.000
Caption: microsoft looking at this

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.640
Caption: look back maybe we don&#39;t need to take

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.200
Caption: the first risk of foray into this

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.359
Caption: particular product space because they

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.919
Caption: knew that they had a 90

00:09:13.359 --> 00:09:18.000
Caption: marker penetration in desktop operating

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:21.599
Caption: systems so what did they do

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.919
Caption: they bundled internet explorer for free

00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:26.880
Caption: so they had huge leverage in terms of

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:29.919
Caption: their existing sales channels

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.160
Caption: and we were also in a case where

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:32.958
Caption: customers users suddenly gaining access

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:34.239
Caption: to

00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:37.039
Caption: the internet

00:09:34.239 --> 00:09:38.880
Caption: was life-changing but it was also in a

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:40.639
Caption: stage where they weren&#39;t incredibly

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.760
Caption: savvy in terms of the differences or the

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:46.559
Caption: nuances between one product and another

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.359
Caption: and so what we saw there is

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:50.559
Caption: microsoft ultimately won that with very

00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:52.000
Caption: little competition

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:53.919
Caption: and internet explorer became the

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.080
Caption: predominant browser

00:09:53.919 --> 00:10:00.559
Caption: but at the end of that first browser war

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.559
Caption: with no competition

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:05.278
Caption: internet explorer stopped progressing it

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:09.599
Caption: stagnated and ultimately gave rise to

00:10:05.278 --> 00:10:09.599
Caption: chrome&#39;s ascendancy some years later

00:10:10.398 --> 00:10:14.719
Caption: and apple we often think of apple

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.479
Caption: i have multiple apple devices been the

00:10:14.719 --> 00:10:17.599
Caption: most innovative company in the world if

00:10:16.479 --> 00:10:19.919
Caption: you look at their strategy it&#39;s

00:10:17.599 --> 00:10:21.199
Caption: fundamentally based on being a fast

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.320
Caption: follower

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.600
Caption: they look at something that someone has

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.039
Caption: done before they do it better they think

00:10:23.599 --> 00:10:28.799
Caption: about the experience around it

00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:29.599
Caption: but whether you have to be the disruptor

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:31.518
Caption: at the

00:10:29.599 --> 00:10:33.039
Caption: the start or

00:10:31.518 --> 00:10:34.398
Caption: the fast follower it a lot depends on

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:36.000
Caption: your market position

00:10:34.398 --> 00:10:38.398
Caption: so if you have the ability to out

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Caption: deliver a competitor so if you&#39;re a big

00:10:38.398 --> 00:10:41.200
Caption: four bank you might look at a fintech or

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.518
Caption: a deal bank

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.559
Caption: that could be an effective strategy one

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:49.359
Caption: one strategy as well would be to acquire

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:51.599
Caption: but if you can not out build or out

00:10:49.359 --> 00:10:55.359
Caption: deliver your competitor a fast follower

00:10:51.599 --> 00:10:55.359
Caption: strategy is doomed to fail

00:10:57.119 --> 00:11:00.640
Caption: there&#39;s another aspect that i&#39;d like to

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:03.760
Caption: explore as well and i&#39;ll introduce the

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:06.958
Caption: kano model and this is typically used to

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.479
Caption: prioritize features on a product roadmap

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.000
Caption: based on the degree that they&#39;re likely

00:11:08.479 --> 00:11:12.958
Caption: to satisfy

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.119
Caption: a customer need

00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.719
Caption: and we will have certain

00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:18.719
Caption: features certain capabilities that will

00:11:16.719 --> 00:11:20.479
Caption: be attractive such that if you fulfill

00:11:18.719 --> 00:11:22.719
Caption: them you will get disproportionate

00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:24.000
Caption: goodwill and market leverage

00:11:22.719 --> 00:11:26.239
Caption: but then there are other features which

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.599
Caption: are considered must-haves

00:11:26.239 --> 00:11:29.278
Caption: so you wind the clock back if you use

00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:30.958
Caption: facial recognition on your phone that

00:11:29.278 --> 00:11:32.880
Caption: was absolutely an attractive feature but

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.719
Caption: now it&#39;s becoming commonplace if you

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.919
Caption: don&#39;t have it customers will not buy

00:11:34.719 --> 00:11:38.398
Caption: your product it will no longer be the

00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:40.078
Caption: differentiator for customers to go out

00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:41.760
Caption: and choose yours

00:11:40.078 --> 00:11:42.398
Caption: and there was a trend here that over

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.479
Caption: time

00:11:42.398 --> 00:11:46.078
Caption: attractive features

00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:47.679
Caption: become must-haves

00:11:46.078 --> 00:11:49.760
Caption: the market moves

00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:52.479
Caption: and it&#39;s the same with technology

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.559
Caption: the novel becomes commonplace and in

00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:57.518
Caption: turn enables the creation of more

00:11:54.559 --> 00:12:01.359
Caption: complex innovations

00:11:57.518 --> 00:12:03.919
Caption: the commonplace enables the novel

00:12:01.359 --> 00:12:06.799
Caption: so again the commodification of storage

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:09.039
Caption: and compute it&#39;s not just about that and

00:12:06.799 --> 00:12:11.518
Caption: doing pay as you go in turn that has

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:13.119
Caption: given rise to innovations with big data

00:12:11.518 --> 00:12:15.518
Caption: machine learning that would previously

00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:18.078
Caption: have been unattainable

00:12:15.518 --> 00:12:20.000
Caption: so again it&#39;s looking at cycles and

00:12:18.078 --> 00:12:22.320
Caption: understanding that in your business

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.760
Caption: there will always be phases that have

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.720
Caption: some areas where you want to break new

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.200
Caption: ground

00:12:24.719 --> 00:12:29.838
Caption: and other areas where you just want to

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.200
Caption: stabilize

00:12:29.838 --> 00:12:32.799
Caption: and the key thing is we have to use

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.440
Caption: appropriate methods for the domain at

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:37.599
Caption: hand so if you use a one-size-fits-all

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.000
Caption: approach across your entire organization

00:12:37.599 --> 00:12:41.440
Caption: it will be sub-optimal by definition you

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.359
Caption: will have some areas of your business

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.359
Caption: where you want to disproportionately

00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:47.599
Caption: invest and innovate and others which you

00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:49.599
Caption: want to stabilize

00:12:47.599 --> 00:12:52.319
Caption: so is there again some prior art that we

00:12:49.599 --> 00:12:54.319
Caption: could look at around this so kent beck

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.720
Caption: you might know him from

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.398
Caption: his days at chrysler and xp

00:12:56.719 --> 00:13:01.278
Caption: but while he was at facebook he created

00:12:58.398 --> 00:13:04.000
Caption: a model called 3x which is three-way

00:13:01.278 --> 00:13:07.518
Caption: phases explore expanded extract

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.278
Caption: so on the y-axis we have payoff and

00:13:07.518 --> 00:13:10.638
Caption: that&#39;s success from a business

00:13:09.278 --> 00:13:12.479
Caption: perspective

00:13:10.638 --> 00:13:14.320
Caption: are we making money is it succeeding is

00:13:12.479 --> 00:13:16.320
Caption: it good for the business

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.638
Caption: and on the x-axis we have customer

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.440
Caption: success is it delighting customers and

00:13:18.638 --> 00:13:22.719
Caption: we are looking for win-win scenarios

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.559
Caption: and when we begin we&#39;re looking for

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:27.199
Caption: product market fit we&#39;re exploring we&#39;re

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:29.440
Caption: building to learn

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.518
Caption: as we gain attraction we get more

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.880
Caption: customers but they&#39;re looking to expand

00:13:31.518 --> 00:13:37.518
Caption: so we&#39;re looking at making it scale

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:40.078
Caption: and finally we&#39;re looking at extracting

00:13:37.518 --> 00:13:42.239
Caption: so how do we make the most money the

00:13:40.078 --> 00:13:43.919
Caption: most value of this

00:13:42.239 --> 00:13:46.078
Caption: while still keeping that customer

00:13:43.919 --> 00:13:48.078
Caption: satisfaction

00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:49.359
Caption: and our focus changes at different

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:50.638
Caption: points

00:13:49.359 --> 00:13:53.119
Caption: so at the beginning we&#39;re looking to

00:13:50.638 --> 00:13:55.919
Caption: eliminate uncertainty

00:13:53.119 --> 00:13:58.479
Caption: what&#39;s a good delivery method for that

00:13:55.919 --> 00:14:00.398
Caption: agile feedback loops

00:13:58.479 --> 00:14:02.078
Caption: but in the center stage we&#39;re then

00:14:00.398 --> 00:14:03.518
Caption: looking at expanding so in this case

00:14:02.078 --> 00:14:05.599
Caption: we&#39;re looking to eliminate waste because

00:14:03.518 --> 00:14:07.039
Caption: any waste in our operating model will be

00:14:05.599 --> 00:14:08.719
Caption: magnified based on the number of

00:14:07.039 --> 00:14:10.719
Caption: customers we have

00:14:08.719 --> 00:14:12.879
Caption: so in this space actually lean

00:14:10.719 --> 00:14:14.479
Caption: techniques are incredibly powerful so

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.119
Caption: looking at forms of buddha and

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:18.320
Caption: eliminating waste whereas right up at

00:14:17.119 --> 00:14:20.880
Caption: the right hand side you might just have

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.518
Caption: an incredibly stable offering but you

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.039
Caption: want to eliminate variability

00:14:23.518 --> 00:14:26.638
Caption: so again structures from there like six

00:14:25.039 --> 00:14:29.119
Caption: sigma which have a focus on reducing

00:14:26.638 --> 00:14:32.000
Caption: defects is incredibly powerful

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:33.919
Caption: so again understanding what methods to

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.078
Caption: apply and when

00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:38.239
Caption: is incredibly important to be able to

00:14:36.078 --> 00:14:40.239
Caption: define the focus and the leverage points

00:14:38.239 --> 00:14:42.320
Caption: in your systems as well

00:14:40.239 --> 00:14:44.880
Caption: so if anyone says to you

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.398
Caption: agile is universally better than x or

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.160
Caption: don&#39;t use white you have to understand

00:14:46.398 --> 00:14:49.599
Caption: the context and you have to understand

00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:52.078
Caption: what you&#39;re looking to achieve at that

00:14:49.599 --> 00:14:53.919
Caption: point in time

00:14:52.078 --> 00:14:57.198
Caption: and there&#39;s also a corollary that our

00:14:53.919 --> 00:14:58.638
Caption: risk appetite over time decreases

00:14:57.198 --> 00:15:00.638
Caption: so at the start we&#39;re building to learn

00:14:58.638 --> 00:15:01.838
Caption: we&#39;re looking for a fit and if it

00:15:00.638 --> 00:15:04.159
Caption: doesn&#39;t work that&#39;s fine we haven&#39;t

00:15:01.838 --> 00:15:05.518
Caption: invested that much

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:06.958
Caption: but if we have a large number of

00:15:05.518 --> 00:15:09.278
Caption: customers

00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:11.119
Caption: a huge amount of investment

00:15:09.278 --> 00:15:12.559
Caption: that again our risk appetite slides

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:14.559
Caption: considerably

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:16.638
Caption: so again being aware when you talk about

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:20.559
Caption: products and teams what is the operating

00:15:16.638 --> 00:15:20.559
Caption: context in terms of your offerings

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.919
Caption: we talked about decisions

00:15:23.838 --> 00:15:26.958
Caption: but decisions without actions are

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:28.559
Caption: pointless

00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.078
Caption: but at the same time we have to be

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:33.359
Caption: distilling information to make sure that

00:15:30.078 --> 00:15:35.359
Caption: the actions we take are well reasoned

00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:36.719
Caption: and this is possibly the single most

00:15:35.359 --> 00:15:38.078
Caption: important thing that we will talk about

00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:40.078
Caption: today

00:15:38.078 --> 00:15:41.440
Caption: and this is the ooda loop by john boyd

00:15:40.078 --> 00:15:43.198
Caption: so a former

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.359
Caption: u.s fighter pilot and a lot of the

00:15:43.198 --> 00:15:47.679
Caption: material that i&#39;m presenting today have

00:15:45.359 --> 00:15:50.000
Caption: its origins back in the work that john

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:53.440
Caption: boyd has done

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.958
Caption: and in it he defines a loop for critical

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.278
Caption: decision making

00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:59.440
Caption: and we and we start with observation so

00:15:57.278 --> 00:16:01.599
Caption: again that&#39;s looking at the environment

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.958
Caption: and sensing outside circumstances that

00:16:01.599 --> 00:16:04.880
Caption: can be

00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.559
Caption: new technology launches competitors

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:10.000
Caption: launch a rival product

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:11.359
Caption: changes in again outbreaks i don&#39;t think

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.398
Caption: that could affect your business from

00:16:11.359 --> 00:16:14.719
Caption: there

00:16:12.398 --> 00:16:16.958
Caption: the next stage is orientate so again

00:16:14.719 --> 00:16:18.958
Caption: based on that input information how

00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:21.278
Caption: should we respond where do we position

00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.638
Caption: ourselves how does that change our model

00:16:21.278 --> 00:16:24.638
Caption: of the world

00:16:22.638 --> 00:16:26.958
Caption: then finally you look at hypotheses what

00:16:24.638 --> 00:16:29.599
Caption: can you do based on this new information

00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:31.838
Caption: and base of those hypotheses you then

00:16:29.599 --> 00:16:33.518
Caption: select options

00:16:31.838 --> 00:16:36.239
Caption: and once you have selected an option you

00:16:33.518 --> 00:16:38.719
Caption: then act so test probe and implement

00:16:36.239 --> 00:16:41.119
Caption: using doctrine so doctrine being your

00:16:38.719 --> 00:16:43.679
Caption: how in terms of simon&#39;s civics golden

00:16:41.119 --> 00:16:45.359
Caption: circle it&#39;s the secret source that built

00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:47.758
Caption: up experience and processes in your

00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:47.758
Caption: company

00:16:48.479 --> 00:16:52.479
Caption: and the quicker you can do this

00:16:50.398 --> 00:16:55.518
Caption: the more quickly you&#39;ll be able to adapt

00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:57.039
Caption: to changes in your environment

00:16:55.518 --> 00:16:59.119
Caption: and the key takeaway is the strategy is

00:16:57.039 --> 00:17:01.198
Caption: not a linear process but an iterative

00:16:59.119 --> 00:17:03.119
Caption: cycle

00:17:01.198 --> 00:17:04.798
Caption: you cannot create the best strategy at a

00:17:03.119 --> 00:17:06.479
Caption: point in time but have it as a guarantee

00:17:04.798 --> 00:17:08.558
Caption: for future success

00:17:06.479 --> 00:17:10.400
Caption: it&#39;s constantly being able to refine as

00:17:08.558 --> 00:17:12.958
Caption: an adapted based on new information

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:16.318
Caption: coming in and then being able to cheaply

00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.318
Caption: validate those hypotheses

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:21.280
Caption: so strategy

00:17:19.198 --> 00:17:22.558
Caption: it&#39;s really an informed opinion about

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.318
Caption: how to win

00:17:22.558 --> 00:17:25.599
Caption: there is an element of a crystal ball to

00:17:24.318 --> 00:17:27.438
Caption: it but again you&#39;re looking to

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:30.319
Caption: assimilate that information and then

00:17:27.438 --> 00:17:31.599
Caption: based on those beliefs in those actions

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:32.880
Caption: that your company will see future

00:17:31.599 --> 00:17:34.880
Caption: success

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.280
Caption: it requires an iterative approach with

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.839
Caption: high context feedback loops

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.239
Caption: and competition is constantly driving

00:17:39.839 --> 00:17:44.959
Caption: change in your environment if you want

00:17:42.239 --> 00:17:46.558
Caption: to really begin your journey in terms of

00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:48.319
Caption: defining strategies

00:17:46.558 --> 00:17:50.479
Caption: learning that broader context both

00:17:48.319 --> 00:17:53.038
Caption: within and outside your company and

00:17:50.479 --> 00:17:55.760
Caption: industry is incredibly valuable

00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:57.759
Caption: situational awareness is the primary

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.160
Caption: capability you need and that&#39;s actually

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.760
Caption: sums up what i just described as well

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.280
Caption: and leveraging models such as the ooda

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.839
Caption: loop

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.679
Caption: and 3x there&#39;s numerous others so i have

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:09.599
Caption: in the slide deck i&#39;ve shared many more

00:18:07.678 --> 00:18:11.359
Caption: models as well that i haven&#39;t presented

00:18:09.599 --> 00:18:13.839
Caption: to you today

00:18:11.359 --> 00:18:16.319
Caption: but then also strategic thinking is a

00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:18.000
Caption: skill and like any skill is subject to

00:18:16.319 --> 00:18:20.159
Caption: the dreyfus model of skills acquisition

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.798
Caption: we will start as novices and at some

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:26.760
Caption: point we may attain mastery but it will

00:18:22.798 --> 00:18:26.760
Caption: take time and dedication

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.559
Caption: so with that let&#39;s turn our attention to

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:35.199
Caption: technology strategy and again let&#39;s

00:18:32.558 --> 00:18:36.798
Caption: start with a quick definition so

00:18:35.199 --> 00:18:40.558
Caption: technology strategy

00:18:36.798 --> 00:18:42.399
Caption: a collective set of decisions

00:18:40.558 --> 00:18:45.119
Caption: around the use of technology and related

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.520
Caption: factors to achieve a business or end

00:18:45.119 --> 00:18:50.000
Caption: user outcome

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.719
Caption: key takeaway is an effective technology

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.400
Caption: strategy amplifies your business

00:18:52.719 --> 00:18:56.719
Caption: strategy

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.080
Caption: if it does not improve the primary

00:18:56.719 --> 00:19:00.079
Caption: outcomes your business are looking to

00:18:58.079 --> 00:19:01.519
Caption: achieve that is not a good technology

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:03.678
Caption: strategy

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:06.320
Caption: so any of the measures that you have

00:19:03.678 --> 00:19:07.599
Caption: around it should be anchored in the user

00:19:06.319 --> 00:19:08.839
Caption: needs or the business outcomes you are

00:19:07.599 --> 00:19:13.199
Caption: looking to

00:19:08.839 --> 00:19:15.199
Caption: achieve and in terms of defining it

00:19:13.199 --> 00:19:17.839
Caption: going long form in a document and

00:19:15.199 --> 00:19:20.319
Caption: writing the technology strategy down

00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:21.918
Caption: is vital to making it accessible

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:24.079
Caption: i was actually a little bit unconvinced

00:19:21.918 --> 00:19:25.439
Caption: about this until i i did a consulting

00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:26.640
Caption: gig while i was at telstra purple at

00:19:25.439 --> 00:19:28.959
Caption: bankwest

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.880
Caption: and we did quite a number of activities

00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:34.159
Caption: for in terms of defining the technology

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.678
Caption: strategy for apis for data for analytics

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.239
Caption: and the level of engagement that

00:19:35.678 --> 00:19:40.319
Caption: garnered and increased understanding

00:19:38.239 --> 00:19:42.719
Caption: across the development teams was

00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:43.918
Caption: extraordinary

00:19:42.719 --> 00:19:45.839
Caption: and

00:19:43.918 --> 00:19:48.959
Caption: we&#39;re going to go through this section

00:19:45.839 --> 00:19:50.719
Caption: reasonably quickly so for two reasons

00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:53.599
Caption: there&#39;s a ton of material that i will

00:19:50.719 --> 00:19:55.439
Caption: link in the resources slide at the end

00:19:53.599 --> 00:19:58.079
Caption: but there&#39;s also information that&#39;s

00:19:55.439 --> 00:19:59.359
Caption: probably best learned and dissected by

00:19:58.079 --> 00:20:01.359
Caption: yourself as well but we&#39;ll go through

00:19:59.359 --> 00:20:02.558
Caption: the quick cliff notes so you get an idea

00:20:01.359 --> 00:20:04.880
Caption: about the various

00:20:02.558 --> 00:20:07.839
Caption: concepts involved

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:11.199
Caption: so possibly oddly we start a technology

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:14.079
Caption: strategy by not talking about technology

00:20:11.199 --> 00:20:17.839
Caption: we anchor it in the business need

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:19.279
Caption: so what is the technical strategy

00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:21.038
Caption: that would need to exist to support the

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.039
Caption: business and to do that you need to

00:20:21.038 --> 00:20:25.199
Caption: understand the business context first so

00:20:23.038 --> 00:20:27.038
Caption: that&#39;s where we start

00:20:25.199 --> 00:20:28.319
Caption: from there we define the tech landscape

00:20:27.038 --> 00:20:30.959
Caption: so what does it look like in your

00:20:28.319 --> 00:20:32.719
Caption: organization today the idea here is to

00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:33.839
Caption: build empathy what are the constraints

00:20:32.719 --> 00:20:34.798
Caption: what are the challenges that you&#39;re

00:20:33.839 --> 00:20:36.640
Caption: facing

00:20:34.798 --> 00:20:38.558
Caption: can you go full

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.400
Caption: serverless architecture well no rob i

00:20:38.558 --> 00:20:42.239
Caption: have a mainframe over here what are we

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.000
Caption: going to do about that so it&#39;s again

00:20:42.239 --> 00:20:46.079
Caption: making sure that we can build a

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.520
Caption: technology strategy that&#39;s realistic

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:50.319
Caption: that references the truth in the

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:52.239
Caption: organization at that point in time

00:20:50.319 --> 00:20:54.719
Caption: but we also need to set america on a

00:20:52.239 --> 00:20:57.599
Caption: hill a vision of where we want to be

00:20:54.719 --> 00:20:58.880
Caption: and this defines the intended direction

00:20:57.599 --> 00:21:00.798
Caption: and the actions that are going to be

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.319
Caption: taken to achieve that it might be

00:21:00.798 --> 00:21:05.119
Caption: breaking down the monolith it might be

00:21:02.319 --> 00:21:07.038
Caption: using strangler patterns to abstract the

00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:08.400
Caption: painful areas of your architecture it

00:21:07.038 --> 00:21:09.918
Caption: might be embracing distributed

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.640
Caption: communication and messaging there could

00:21:09.918 --> 00:21:14.479
Caption: be many things that you could involve

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.558
Caption: but this is again

00:21:14.479 --> 00:21:18.558
Caption: building those principles that will then

00:21:16.558 --> 00:21:20.158
Caption: get your architecture or your technology

00:21:18.558 --> 00:21:22.319
Caption: strategy from a

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:23.679
Caption: to b

00:21:22.319 --> 00:21:25.519
Caption: and then there&#39;s the principles and

00:21:23.678 --> 00:21:27.760
Caption: guardrails to enable effective

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.679
Caption: distributed decision making whenever

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.678
Caption: we&#39;re looking at a technology strategy

00:21:29.678 --> 00:21:33.599
Caption: your goal should be how do i give the

00:21:31.678 --> 00:21:34.798
Caption: teams at the edge the context to make

00:21:33.599 --> 00:21:37.038
Caption: good decisions

00:21:34.798 --> 00:21:38.639
Caption: rather than trying to centralize

00:21:37.038 --> 00:21:40.959
Caption: thinking into a

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.359
Caption: centralized architecture team or similar

00:21:40.959 --> 00:21:45.439
Caption: and being able to define principles and

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:47.038
Caption: guarantees are key for that

00:21:45.439 --> 00:21:50.239
Caption: so let&#39;s take a look at this

00:21:47.038 --> 00:21:52.639
Caption: so i&#39;ll share an example from myob

00:21:50.239 --> 00:21:54.880
Caption: created by their former cto simon reich

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.959
Caption: allen and and their platform manifesto

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.558
Caption: was written in a very similar way to the

00:21:56.959 --> 00:22:00.880
Caption: agile manifesto

00:21:58.558 --> 00:22:02.719
Caption: and they talk about

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.039
Caption: the medium-term decisions over

00:22:02.719 --> 00:22:06.719
Caption: short-term thinking stable technologies

00:22:05.038 --> 00:22:10.639
Caption: over the unproven

00:22:06.719 --> 00:22:11.599
Caption: existing assets overdue development

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.880
Caption: and there&#39;s a couple of things we can

00:22:11.599 --> 00:22:15.119
Caption: learn from this

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.599
Caption: actually remember that expand extract

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:20.479
Caption: model that i showed before 3x a lot of

00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:21.760
Caption: where myob are a stable mature business

00:22:20.479 --> 00:22:23.520
Caption: they&#39;ve already gone through the

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.199
Caption: eliminating uncertainty and they&#39;re

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.400
Caption: looking to eliminate waste in their

00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:28.798
Caption: systems now they&#39;re looking to be able

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.479
Caption: to scale out their platform and what

00:22:28.798 --> 00:22:33.038
Caption: they give you the guidance their teams

00:22:30.479 --> 00:22:34.880
Caption: is to encourage decisions and actions

00:22:33.038 --> 00:22:38.079
Caption: which are not about hitting an immediate

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:41.400
Caption: goal but the long-term sustainability of

00:22:38.079 --> 00:22:41.399
Caption: their platform

00:22:41.599 --> 00:22:45.520
Caption: then also documenting what your

00:22:43.119 --> 00:22:47.520
Caption: technology radar or scope is and making

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.039
Caption: it visible to all the teams

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.200
Caption: so again with a couple of clients i have

00:22:49.038 --> 00:22:53.678
Caption: worked with a build your own radar by

00:22:51.199 --> 00:22:55.839
Caption: thoughtworks um again it&#39;s worked really

00:22:53.678 --> 00:22:57.519
Caption: well in some places not another so again

00:22:55.839 --> 00:22:59.839
Caption: use it with your own discretion your

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.080
Caption: mileage may vary but in terms of

00:22:59.839 --> 00:23:04.239
Caption: visualizing across the teams

00:23:02.079 --> 00:23:06.399
Caption: what matters and what&#39;s current in terms

00:23:04.239 --> 00:23:10.079
Caption: of adopt or trial or assess within your

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:12.159
Caption: organization can be incredibly powerful

00:23:10.079 --> 00:23:13.678
Caption: one word of warning though is have a lot

00:23:12.159 --> 00:23:15.679
Caption: of thought at the start about the level

00:23:13.678 --> 00:23:17.599
Caption: of fidelity that you want to go to

00:23:15.678 --> 00:23:19.359
Caption: including every single library used by

00:23:17.599 --> 00:23:22.319
Caption: every single team will create a huge

00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:23.918
Caption: amount of noise very little value and

00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:24.959
Caption: the last part of that is documenting

00:23:23.918 --> 00:23:26.399
Caption: decisions

00:23:24.959 --> 00:23:28.798
Caption: so if you&#39;re familiar with the

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.960
Caption: architecture decision records pattern

00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:32.639
Caption: it&#39;s very similar it&#39;s about clearly

00:23:30.959 --> 00:23:33.760
Caption: articulating what you want to achieve in

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.839
Caption: your changes

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.760
Caption: in your technology decisions assessing

00:23:35.839 --> 00:23:40.000
Caption: options as they pertain to the success

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.239
Caption: criteria and they&#39;re also defining why

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.839
Caption: you chose a certain option

00:23:42.239 --> 00:23:45.520
Caption: and that might be we would have loved to

00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:48.239
Caption: choose option a

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.239
Caption: but for time pressures or cost pressures

00:23:48.239 --> 00:23:51.839
Caption: or skills within the team we have chosen

00:23:50.239 --> 00:23:53.359
Caption: a different option

00:23:51.839 --> 00:23:54.798
Caption: and that&#39;s about building empathy for

00:23:53.359 --> 00:23:56.959
Caption: the next people who join the team to

00:23:54.798 --> 00:23:59.038
Caption: understand why you&#39;re in a current

00:23:56.959 --> 00:24:00.880
Caption: situation and it&#39;s incredibly valuable

00:23:59.038 --> 00:24:03.278
Caption: learning material for when someone joins

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.599
Caption: your team

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:07.679
Caption: and remember strategy is iterative treat

00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:09.599
Caption: this technology strategy document in the

00:24:07.678 --> 00:24:10.719
Caption: same way donate for perfection on the

00:24:09.599 --> 00:24:13.439
Caption: first pass

00:24:10.719 --> 00:24:15.119
Caption: time box it so what i did at bankwest i

00:24:13.439 --> 00:24:17.119
Caption: think we did four weeks

00:24:15.119 --> 00:24:18.558
Caption: so we did a whole lot of interviews and

00:24:17.119 --> 00:24:22.079
Caption: then shipped it for feedback that

00:24:18.558 --> 00:24:22.079
Caption: improved over a couple of iterations

00:24:23.038 --> 00:24:27.519
Caption: and the key thing is

00:24:25.678 --> 00:24:29.278
Caption: share it with people during their

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.760
Caption: inductions when someone joins your team

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:34.159
Caption: walk them through that document treat it

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.558
Caption: as a living artifact so building a

00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:38.320
Caption: review process every three months is it

00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:40.959
Caption: still current is it still adding value

00:24:38.319 --> 00:24:40.959
Caption: to the teams

00:24:41.038 --> 00:24:45.519
Caption: so a couple of takeaways

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.918
Caption: so a technology strategy should amplify

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.760
Caption: the business or user outcomes

00:24:47.918 --> 00:24:51.359
Caption: and defining a long-form technology

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.798
Caption: strategy documents is an excellent way

00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:54.640
Caption: of doing things

00:24:52.798 --> 00:24:56.959
Caption: and just like strategy and initiative

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:59.039
Caption: process the technology strategy should

00:24:56.959 --> 00:25:00.880
Caption: be defined in the same way

00:24:59.038 --> 00:25:03.038
Caption: and ensure the technology strategy is

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.039
Caption: visible it will only add value if it&#39;s

00:25:03.038 --> 00:25:08.879
Caption: visible and it&#39;s embedded in the

00:25:05.038 --> 00:25:08.879
Caption: onboarding process across addie t

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:13.839
Caption: okay probably my favorite section of

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:15.440
Caption: this talk so metrics how do you actually

00:25:13.839 --> 00:25:17.038
Caption: measure if you&#39;re going in the right

00:25:15.439 --> 00:25:19.119
Caption: direction

00:25:17.038 --> 00:25:20.399
Caption: so situational awareness incredibly

00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:23.119
Caption: powerful

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:26.159
Caption: but user needs cannot be

00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:28.880
Caption: best by just becoming aware of them

00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:30.960
Caption: that would be a think tank we have to be

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.199
Caption: able to make actions and deliver upon

00:25:30.959 --> 00:25:33.199
Caption: them

00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:36.159
Caption: and i&#39;ll

00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:37.918
Caption: read you you&#39;re not going to find this

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:40.240
Caption: in macquarie this is my personal

00:25:37.918 --> 00:25:41.918
Caption: definition of a metric and there&#39;s a few

00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:44.158
Caption: things that would like to point you your

00:25:41.918 --> 00:25:48.399
Caption: attention to so it&#39;s a quantifiable

00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:50.880
Caption: measure of the performance of a business

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.359
Caption: or a component of your business

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.918
Caption: and a change in the metric should inform

00:25:53.359 --> 00:26:00.079
Caption: whether the existing course of behavior

00:25:55.918 --> 00:26:02.880
Caption: should be continued or adjusted

00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:06.640
Caption: so a metric is only valuable if it

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.400
Caption: drives behavior within your organization

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.520
Caption: and a metric can be applied to an

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.640
Caption: application

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:16.080
Caption: a business department people process

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:18.000
Caption: system but it needs to drive behavior

00:26:16.079 --> 00:26:19.760
Caption: and let&#39;s see how that might work in

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.119
Caption: practice so if we have an evolutionary

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:24.798
Caption: system we will get at the start

00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:26.959
Caption: at any point in time we will have a

00:26:24.798 --> 00:26:28.479
Caption: number of options that are presented to

00:26:26.959 --> 00:26:30.399
Caption: us so to say we&#39;re going through the

00:26:28.479 --> 00:26:32.558
Caption: ooda loop we&#39;re assessing these options

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.640
Caption: and then we decide

00:26:32.558 --> 00:26:37.439
Caption: so as we continue down and we test and

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:39.279
Caption: we learn are these improving our core

00:26:37.439 --> 00:26:41.439
Caption: measures if they are that we take them

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:43.679
Caption: as successful candidates

00:26:41.439 --> 00:26:45.759
Caption: and we can then move to point b if they

00:26:43.678 --> 00:26:47.199
Caption: are not achieving the outcomes we would

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.919
Caption: wish to see then we have to change

00:26:47.199 --> 00:26:53.278
Caption: course change direction

00:26:49.918 --> 00:26:55.199
Caption: so metrics act as that guiding light of

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:57.119
Caption: if you&#39;re doing the right thing within

00:26:55.199 --> 00:26:59.038
Caption: your business

00:26:57.119 --> 00:27:00.719
Caption: and again at any point in time we have

00:26:59.038 --> 00:27:02.959
Caption: multiple options

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:05.520
Caption: using effective metrics to guide our

00:27:02.959 --> 00:27:07.038
Caption: path through to some arbitrary end and

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.279
Caption: of course with an evolutionary system

00:27:07.038 --> 00:27:11.359
Caption: there is no end but this is why being

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:13.440
Caption: able to have a quantifiable measure is

00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:16.319
Caption: incredibly important

00:27:13.439 --> 00:27:18.319
Caption: but again the measure is only the start

00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:19.519
Caption: it&#39;s being able to align your behavior

00:27:18.319 --> 00:27:21.439
Caption: to it

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.200
Caption: so i think i probably said metric two

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:24.719
Caption: dozen times already and i said they&#39;re

00:27:23.199 --> 00:27:27.599
Caption: really important

00:27:24.719 --> 00:27:29.918
Caption: but how should you go about choosing

00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:31.359
Caption: a good metric how do you find these

00:27:29.918 --> 00:27:33.599
Caption: things that will guide you towards

00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:34.640
Caption: success

00:27:33.599 --> 00:27:37.278
Caption: first

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:40.959
Caption: don&#39;t start with a metric

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:44.080
Caption: that&#39;s the key piece of advice so

00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:45.839
Caption: a metric should be at output so

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:47.199
Caption: if you want to begin again you go back

00:27:45.839 --> 00:27:49.599
Caption: to your work on monday figure out what&#39;s

00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:51.599
Caption: important to your organization

00:27:49.599 --> 00:27:52.880
Caption: what&#39;s one of your goals

00:27:51.599 --> 00:27:55.599
Caption: and then think of a couple of ways that

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:58.399
Caption: you might got to satisfy that goal

00:27:55.599 --> 00:27:59.839
Caption: move the needle on one of them

00:27:58.399 --> 00:28:02.480
Caption: then what work would need to be done

00:27:59.839 --> 00:28:05.678
Caption: might be there might be an existing team

00:28:02.479 --> 00:28:07.439
Caption: looking to progress one of those goals

00:28:05.678 --> 00:28:10.079
Caption: and again ideally start executing that

00:28:07.439 --> 00:28:11.599
Caption: initiative it&#39;s only at this point once

00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:14.319
Caption: you have done those first three steps

00:28:11.599 --> 00:28:16.640
Caption: that you should really think about a

00:28:14.319 --> 00:28:18.398
Caption: measure or a metric

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.399
Caption: and the good metric will be one to say

00:28:18.399 --> 00:28:22.159
Caption: whether they&#39;re making progress

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:23.520
Caption: and the single most important question

00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:24.960
Caption: you can ask yourself when you&#39;re

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.760
Caption: defining a metric or throughout this

00:28:24.959 --> 00:28:28.839
Caption: process is is this work allied with the

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.919
Caption: user

00:28:28.839 --> 00:28:34.000
Caption: need and a good metric will be what that

00:28:31.918 --> 00:28:35.918
Caption: matters what that matters to your users

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.359
Caption: or customers that you can do something

00:28:35.918 --> 00:28:39.199
Caption: about that&#39;s actionable that you could

00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:42.479
Caption: change behavior around it and that

00:28:39.199 --> 00:28:44.079
Caption: reflects your business performance

00:28:42.479 --> 00:28:46.959
Caption: so more broadly if we go to ankara

00:28:44.079 --> 00:28:48.959
Caption: metrics based on customers you can look

00:28:46.959 --> 00:28:51.678
Caption: at dave mcclure&#39;s pirate metrics which

00:28:48.959 --> 00:28:53.678
Caption: then map each phase of a customer as

00:28:51.678 --> 00:28:55.599
Caption: they might relate to your business

00:28:53.678 --> 00:28:57.359
Caption: so we can start with acquisition so how

00:28:55.599 --> 00:28:59.760
Caption: do users find you you might have certain

00:28:57.359 --> 00:29:00.798
Caption: metrics about how do you bring people to

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.479
Caption: your product

00:29:00.798 --> 00:29:04.239
Caption: once they found you how do you sign them

00:29:02.479 --> 00:29:06.239
Caption: up how do you give an excellent first

00:29:04.239 --> 00:29:08.158
Caption: experience to them

00:29:06.239 --> 00:29:10.000
Caption: that is about retention so once they&#39;ve

00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:12.159
Caption: used your product once how do you keep

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.798
Caption: them coming back how do you continue to

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:16.720
Caption: deliver value for them

00:29:14.798 --> 00:29:19.439
Caption: with referral how do you turn these

00:29:16.719 --> 00:29:21.439
Caption: users into advocates for your product

00:29:19.439 --> 00:29:24.000
Caption: how do they tell others

00:29:21.439 --> 00:29:25.918
Caption: then how do you make money from them

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.439
Caption: i should point out that these are a

00:29:25.918 --> 00:29:29.439
Caption: guiding light to be able to categorize

00:29:27.439 --> 00:29:31.678
Caption: where your users are and then think

00:29:29.439 --> 00:29:33.599
Caption: about questions or goals you would have

00:29:31.678 --> 00:29:36.239
Caption: and ultimately define the metrics off of

00:29:33.599 --> 00:29:38.158
Caption: them these are not sequential so you

00:29:36.239 --> 00:29:40.158
Caption: might have an area where revenue is

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:42.000
Caption: actually incredibly important to your

00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:43.760
Caption: business you might immediately after

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.678
Caption: activation then you&#39;re caring about

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.279
Caption: revenue and then later you might be

00:29:45.678 --> 00:29:49.119
Caption: caring about growth

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:51.039
Caption: so in this particular sequence i have

00:29:49.119 --> 00:29:53.119
Caption: said that growth is really important so

00:29:51.038 --> 00:29:56.000
Caption: i&#39;m looking for market share and then

00:29:53.119 --> 00:29:59.760
Caption: money and income is based on scale not

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.760
Caption: the percentage income per user

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.359
Caption: but being able to define metrics like

00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:06.959
Caption: this requires a certain level of data

00:30:05.359 --> 00:30:08.398
Caption: informed decisions amongst your business

00:30:06.959 --> 00:30:11.359
Caption: so again this is something i do need to

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:13.520
Caption: call out here so in my

00:30:11.359 --> 00:30:15.918
Caption: multiple years of consulting

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.000
Caption: i have seen many organizations struggle

00:30:15.918 --> 00:30:20.319
Caption: with this because you can&#39;t suddenly

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.640
Caption: start generating customer insights it

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:25.199
Caption: needs to start with data and data needs

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:27.119
Caption: to be categorized cleansed synthesized

00:30:25.199 --> 00:30:28.479
Caption: into information and then once you

00:30:27.119 --> 00:30:32.479
Caption: catalog this information you can

00:30:28.479 --> 00:30:34.640
Caption: generate insights from it

00:30:32.479 --> 00:30:36.640
Caption: and most companies don&#39;t capture the

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:40.079
Caption: data they would need to make informed

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:41.039
Caption: decisions so example in a in a banking

00:30:40.079 --> 00:30:43.519
Caption: app

00:30:41.038 --> 00:30:45.359
Caption: at bankwest we saw that when a customer

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.679
Caption: changed their name we didn&#39;t do anything

00:30:45.359 --> 00:30:49.359
Caption: about it we just saved it

00:30:47.678 --> 00:30:50.640
Caption: but a customer could change their name

00:30:49.359 --> 00:30:52.000
Caption: for multiple reasons they could be

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.239
Caption: getting married they could be getting

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.319
Caption: divorced how you would respond to that

00:30:54.239 --> 00:30:57.599
Caption: from a business context is incredibly

00:30:56.319 --> 00:30:59.439
Caption: different

00:30:57.599 --> 00:31:01.359
Caption: but again if you just do it at a crud

00:30:59.439 --> 00:31:03.518
Caption: operation you lose a lot of that

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:06.158
Caption: valuable context to understand how you

00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:07.440
Caption: should respond to it

00:31:06.159 --> 00:31:08.960
Caption: so again whenever you&#39;re building your

00:31:07.439 --> 00:31:10.558
Caption: systems think about not what you&#39;re

00:31:08.959 --> 00:31:13.278
Caption: doing in terms of a data change but the

00:31:10.558 --> 00:31:15.278
Caption: intent behind that because that will

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:18.279
Caption: then yield far greater insights down the

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:18.279
Caption: line

00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:23.039
Caption: and simon wardley so the man behind

00:31:21.199 --> 00:31:24.639
Caption: wardley maps

00:31:23.038 --> 00:31:26.639
Caption: he has also defined a set of doctrines

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.079
Caption: so universal best practices irrespective

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.440
Caption: of your industry things that we should

00:31:28.079 --> 00:31:33.678
Caption: be doing to improve the ongoing success

00:31:31.439 --> 00:31:36.079
Caption: of our business

00:31:33.678 --> 00:31:37.119
Caption: so again universal patterns

00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:39.678
Caption: and if we looked in the worlds of

00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:41.519
Caption: metrics can we find universal metrics

00:31:39.678 --> 00:31:43.839
Caption: that irrespective of your industry that

00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:45.200
Caption: are valuable to follow

00:31:43.839 --> 00:31:47.278
Caption: and i feel there are

00:31:45.199 --> 00:31:49.278
Caption: so in the work by nicole forsgren jess

00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:51.119
Caption: humble and gene kim and accelerate

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:53.279
Caption: they&#39;ve defined four devops state of the

00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:54.479
Caption: union metrics

00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:56.240
Caption: and just before we go a little bit

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:57.918
Caption: further so devops it&#39;s a set of

00:31:56.239 --> 00:31:59.519
Caption: practices that work to automate and

00:31:57.918 --> 00:32:02.319
Caption: integrate the processes between software

00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:04.000
Caption: and i t teams so they can learn faster

00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:06.319
Caption: you might see other things to go so they

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.558
Caption: can really software better it&#39;s not it&#39;s

00:32:06.319 --> 00:32:10.079
Caption: actually about amplifying feedback loops

00:32:08.558 --> 00:32:11.760
Caption: so again being able to increase the

00:32:10.079 --> 00:32:13.678
Caption: speed or cadence with which you can

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.678
Caption: release software allow you to build your

00:32:13.678 --> 00:32:17.278
Caption: situational awareness

00:32:15.678 --> 00:32:19.278
Caption: but the four metrics they&#39;ve defined are

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:22.320
Caption: as follows so deployment frequency we

00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:23.840
Caption: want the higher the number as possible

00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:25.759
Caption: lead time for change we want this to be

00:32:23.839 --> 00:32:29.038
Caption: as short as possible so the time from

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:31.039
Caption: when we go to idea to production

00:32:29.038 --> 00:32:32.639
Caption: we want mean time to recover to be as

00:32:31.038 --> 00:32:34.319
Caption: low as possible so when we have a server

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:36.719
Caption: out is how do we minimize the impact to

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:38.639
Caption: our customers and again fail change rate

00:32:36.719 --> 00:32:40.239
Caption: we want that to be as low as possible as

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.239
Caption: well so i&#39;m actually going to group

00:32:40.239 --> 00:32:44.719
Caption: these so i&#39;d say the first two as being

00:32:42.239 --> 00:32:46.558
Caption: speed focused and the second two being

00:32:44.719 --> 00:32:49.199
Caption: stability focused

00:32:46.558 --> 00:32:51.038
Caption: so again let&#39;s plot this on a graph so

00:32:49.199 --> 00:32:53.119
Caption: on the y-axis let&#39;s look at speed of

00:32:51.038 --> 00:32:55.359
Caption: productivity and on the x-axis we&#39;ll

00:32:53.119 --> 00:32:57.439
Caption: look at quality and stability and we&#39;ll

00:32:55.359 --> 00:32:58.798
Caption: plot our metrics on it

00:32:57.439 --> 00:33:00.479
Caption: and i will now introduce to you

00:32:58.798 --> 00:33:02.959
Caption: crowley&#39;s non-scientific code of

00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:05.119
Caption: balanced behavior

00:33:02.959 --> 00:33:06.640
Caption: so what we are looking at from here is

00:33:05.119 --> 00:33:09.119
Caption: as an organization with your risk

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.119
Caption: appetite how fast do you want to go so

00:33:09.119 --> 00:33:13.359
Caption: are you actually comfortable increasing

00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:15.439
Caption: your change frequency at the cost of

00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:16.959
Caption: maybe a slight increase to your failed

00:33:15.439 --> 00:33:18.959
Caption: change rate

00:33:16.959 --> 00:33:20.558
Caption: so again being able to define these

00:33:18.959 --> 00:33:22.959
Caption: metrics that are actually in positive

00:33:20.558 --> 00:33:26.158
Caption: tension with each other to then create

00:33:22.959 --> 00:33:28.239
Caption: balanced behavior within your teams

00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:30.480
Caption: and in this model based on your risk

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:35.359
Caption: appetite and maturity it is absolutely

00:33:30.479 --> 00:33:35.359
Caption: possible to have both speed and quality

00:33:35.678 --> 00:33:40.719
Caption: but success is far from guaranteed let&#39;s

00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:43.200
Caption: look at a couple of examples where you

00:33:40.719 --> 00:33:46.398
Caption: can go wrong with metrics because it is

00:33:43.199 --> 00:33:49.439
Caption: a path paved in tears

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:52.640
Caption: the first is creating metrics that only

00:33:49.439 --> 00:33:54.719
Caption: focus on avoiding errors how many people

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:57.839
Caption: have a measure within your organization

00:33:54.719 --> 00:33:59.439
Caption: that says number of p ones in the last

00:33:57.839 --> 00:34:01.839
Caption: quarter

00:33:59.439 --> 00:34:04.079
Caption: oh there&#39;s a few isn&#39;t there i actually

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:06.079
Caption: think that&#39;s a shocking measure right to

00:34:04.079 --> 00:34:10.000
Caption: be honest the only thing that&#39;s going to

00:34:06.079 --> 00:34:12.320
Caption: drive teams to do is release less

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.638
Caption: because when you do a release it injects

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.959
Caption: entropy into your environment and the

00:34:14.638 --> 00:34:18.239
Caption: chance of an incident increases so if

00:34:16.959 --> 00:34:21.118
Caption: that&#39;s the only thing you&#39;re measuring

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:22.878
Caption: your teams on it will atrophy change you

00:34:21.118 --> 00:34:24.878
Caption: need to balance it with a productivity

00:34:22.878 --> 00:34:25.678
Caption: metric as well that encourages teams to

00:34:24.878 --> 00:34:28.078
Caption: go

00:34:25.678 --> 00:34:30.158
Caption: faster

00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:32.000
Caption: so again don&#39;t build metrics on avoiding

00:34:30.158 --> 00:34:35.000
Caption: errors build metrics on achieving

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Caption: excellence

00:34:35.599 --> 00:34:38.720
Caption: there&#39;s also one of my favorites so the

00:34:36.878 --> 00:34:40.479
Caption: cobra effect and this is defining a

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:42.878
Caption: metric that is has an intent of

00:34:40.479 --> 00:34:45.118
Caption: improving a situation but actually does

00:34:42.878 --> 00:34:47.439
Caption: the complete opposite these are known as

00:34:45.118 --> 00:34:48.638
Caption: perverse incentives so let&#39;s look at an

00:34:47.439 --> 00:34:51.598
Caption: example

00:34:48.638 --> 00:34:53.598
Caption: so back in the 1990s in new york and

00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:56.079
Caption: pennsylvania they

00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:58.480
Caption: the health department started publishing

00:34:56.079 --> 00:35:00.880
Caption: stats around patients doing culinary

00:34:58.479 --> 00:35:03.760
Caption: bypasses and the idea was that if you

00:35:00.879 --> 00:35:05.598
Caption: then publish that information about

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.760
Caption: doctors who have the highest success

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:10.000
Caption: rates in this case or lowest mortality

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.280
Caption: rates that you would then see

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.118
Caption: the better doctors getting more of the

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.119
Caption: work and the doctors with a poor record

00:35:13.118 --> 00:35:17.598
Caption: getting less it makes sense win for the

00:35:15.118 --> 00:35:20.399
Caption: doctor win for the patients

00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:21.680
Caption: what we actually saw was that doctors

00:35:20.399 --> 00:35:23.598
Caption: stopped

00:35:21.679 --> 00:35:24.879
Caption: operating on really sick people

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:27.680
Caption: because really sick people have the

00:35:24.879 --> 00:35:29.039
Caption: unfortunate habit of

00:35:27.679 --> 00:35:31.118
Caption: dying

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.359
Caption: and that&#39;s absolutely horrible because

00:35:31.118 --> 00:35:35.279
Caption: it&#39;s the exact opposite of the intent of

00:35:33.358 --> 00:35:37.279
Caption: that metric but again it&#39;s like i

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.760
Caption: defined before the metric only measured

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:42.239
Caption: what axes of behavior and did not create

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.239
Caption: a balanced situation

00:35:42.239 --> 00:35:46.479
Caption: the great hanoi rap massacre is another

00:35:44.239 --> 00:35:48.239
Caption: famous example of campbell&#39;s law in

00:35:46.479 --> 00:35:50.479
Caption: action

00:35:48.239 --> 00:35:52.079
Caption: we also have vanity metrics so metrics

00:35:50.479 --> 00:35:53.919
Caption: that depict the rosiest picture possible

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:56.160
Caption: but they&#39;ll accurately reflect the key

00:35:53.919 --> 00:35:58.399
Caption: drivers of your business

00:35:56.159 --> 00:36:01.280
Caption: so unless you&#39;re

00:35:58.399 --> 00:36:03.598
Caption: making money from ad impressions then

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:07.199
Caption: total page counts or total hits is

00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:09.119
Caption: likely not going to be successful

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:12.719
Caption: cargo cult metrics

00:36:09.118 --> 00:36:15.199
Caption: choosing metrics of popular companies

00:36:12.719 --> 00:36:19.040
Caption: because they are successful even if that

00:36:15.199 --> 00:36:20.639
Caption: context does not map to your own

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.719
Caption: i&#39;m doing it because a successful

00:36:20.639 --> 00:36:24.159
Caption: company is doing it all we&#39;re doing is

00:36:22.719 --> 00:36:25.919
Caption: imitating

00:36:24.159 --> 00:36:27.439
Caption: and we&#39;re substituting imitation for

00:36:25.919 --> 00:36:29.439
Caption: understanding and it&#39;s a beguiling

00:36:27.439 --> 00:36:31.118
Caption: shortcut but it is one that is fraught

00:36:29.439 --> 00:36:32.639
Caption: in peril because you don&#39;t understand if

00:36:31.118 --> 00:36:35.358
Caption: those are actually aligned to your

00:36:32.639 --> 00:36:35.358
Caption: business drivers

00:36:35.599 --> 00:36:41.359
Caption: measuring outputs is one of the worst

00:36:38.639 --> 00:36:43.919
Caption: lines of code delivered by a developer

00:36:41.358 --> 00:36:46.559
Caption: total number of pull requests reviewed

00:36:43.919 --> 00:36:48.719
Caption: so things are outputs and not outcomes

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.760
Caption: these just create noise and add very

00:36:48.719 --> 00:36:53.439
Caption: little value across the board

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.520
Caption: possibly one of the most evil weaponized

00:36:53.439 --> 00:36:57.520
Caption: metrics and this is using metrics for

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.359
Caption: comparison and punishment rather than

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.959
Caption: for continuous improvement you might

00:36:59.358 --> 00:37:03.919
Caption: often see this from another department

00:37:00.959 --> 00:37:05.439
Caption: head saying why have you increased your

00:37:03.919 --> 00:37:07.040
Caption: fail change rate so why can&#39;t you

00:37:05.439 --> 00:37:09.040
Caption: deliver on time

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.880
Caption: so these are particularly toxic

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.719
Caption: behaviors that you can see

00:37:10.879 --> 00:37:14.078
Caption: and again there&#39;s a law for everything

00:37:12.719 --> 00:37:16.078
Caption: this is actually an example of

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:18.000
Caption: goodheart&#39;s law which states that any

00:37:16.079 --> 00:37:19.839
Caption: observed statistical regularity will

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.639
Caption: tend to collapse once pressure is placed

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:24.239
Caption: upon it for control purposes or another

00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:26.000
Caption: way of saying is

00:37:24.239 --> 00:37:28.879
Caption: when a measure becomes a target it

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.639
Caption: ceases to be a good measure so what

00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:32.639
Caption: should we do to confront this

00:37:30.639 --> 00:37:34.239
Caption: organizational anti-pattern remove

00:37:32.639 --> 00:37:36.639
Caption: information silently

00:37:34.239 --> 00:37:38.159
Caption: so again having as much broadcast across

00:37:36.639 --> 00:37:40.319
Caption: the company around the metrics is a

00:37:38.159 --> 00:37:42.000
Caption: great way to remove some of the leverage

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.920
Caption: from there ensuring that you have

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.839
Caption: metrics that create positive tension

00:37:43.919 --> 00:37:48.838
Caption: between an actor&#39;s pairs rather than

00:37:45.839 --> 00:37:51.040
Caption: skewing towards a single

00:37:48.839 --> 00:37:53.359
Caption: outcome those are some of the key

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.520
Caption: aspects that you need to first of all

00:37:53.358 --> 00:37:57.919
Caption: identify but prevent

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.079
Caption: weaponized again focused on changing

00:37:57.919 --> 00:38:01.838
Caption: behavior for personal gain rather than

00:38:00.079 --> 00:38:04.239
Caption: business outcomes

00:38:01.839 --> 00:38:05.760
Caption: so with metrics paper conversations to

00:38:04.239 --> 00:38:07.118
Caption: metrics rather than not actionable

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.880
Caption: opinions

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:11.439
Caption: customer needs user needs they&#39;re

00:38:08.879 --> 00:38:14.239
Caption: absolutely your key effective metrics

00:38:11.439 --> 00:38:18.479
Caption: often work in pairs and metrics only

00:38:14.239 --> 00:38:20.239
Caption: deliver value if they influence behavior

00:38:18.479 --> 00:38:22.159
Caption: so in the last couple of minutes that we

00:38:20.239 --> 00:38:24.479
Caption: have together what are things that you

00:38:22.159 --> 00:38:26.559
Caption: can bring back to your organization and

00:38:24.479 --> 00:38:27.919
Caption: how should your thinking be applied to

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.839
Caption: certain situations that you face

00:38:27.919 --> 00:38:31.760
Caption: yourself in

00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:33.760
Caption: and i will i will start with a disgra

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.280
Caption: disclaimer here the transition

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:37.520
Caption: between

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.479
Caption: delivery and strategic focuses

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.119
Caption: is

00:38:38.479 --> 00:38:43.118
Caption: super difficult but it is one that is

00:38:41.118 --> 00:38:45.679
Caption: worth persisting with

00:38:43.118 --> 00:38:47.919
Caption: technical ability is unlikely going to

00:38:45.679 --> 00:38:50.078
Caption: be the constraint on the ability to grow

00:38:47.919 --> 00:38:51.760
Caption: your career at some point technical

00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:53.040
Caption: ability will take you to a point and

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.280
Caption: then being able to look more broadly

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.640
Caption: around the solution will help

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.560
Caption: so invest in truly learning your

00:38:56.639 --> 00:39:00.559
Caption: business and industry and that&#39;s vital

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.320
Caption: to growing situational awareness

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.839
Caption: learn the context both within your team

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.000
Caption: your department your organization and

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:08.000
Caption: the environment this is a huge step

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.919
Caption: change thing for you and embrace

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.800
Caption: empiricism it&#39;s a great way to level up

00:39:09.919 --> 00:39:14.799
Caption: your influencing skills so base metrics

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:17.119
Caption: are the base conversations of metrics

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.520
Caption: rather than non-actionable opinions so i

00:39:17.118 --> 00:39:21.598
Caption: don&#39;t feel x understand how soon do you

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:23.679
Caption: need it when do we need that by

00:39:21.599 --> 00:39:26.079
Caption: questions like that can help drive

00:39:23.679 --> 00:39:27.598
Caption: concrete answers in that case

00:39:26.079 --> 00:39:30.079
Caption: and while you may not always have the

00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:32.079
Caption: authority to make a decision you can

00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:33.920
Caption: always champion a cause

00:39:32.079 --> 00:39:36.640
Caption: work with leaders and other people to

00:39:33.919 --> 00:39:38.719
Caption: help push that direction

00:39:36.639 --> 00:39:40.799
Caption: and build your network both inside and

00:39:38.719 --> 00:39:42.879
Caption: outside work hallway

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.479
Caption: conversations incredibly powerful when

00:39:42.879 --> 00:39:46.159
Caption: you leave this breakout session talk to

00:39:44.479 --> 00:39:47.520
Caption: your peers talk to other people in the

Caption: community and start building your

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.679
Caption: awareness of how challenges that they&#39;re

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:52.800
Caption: facing and what they&#39;re doing around it

00:39:51.679 --> 00:39:54.800
Caption: as well

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.239
Caption: if you&#39;re leading teams focus on growing

Caption: an environment that encourages the

00:39:56.239 --> 00:39:59.760
Caption: behavior you want to see and which is a

00:39:58.239 --> 00:40:01.598
Caption: quick corollary that if you&#39;re trying to

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.760
Caption: embed behaviors that run contrary to the

Caption: strategy

00:40:17.439 --> 00:40:22.318
Caption: looking at models such as 3x at the ooda

00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:24.880
Caption: loop could be key to increasing your

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:27.280
Caption: situational awareness around them

00:40:24.879 --> 00:40:29.519
Caption: metrics are key driver for delivering

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.199
Caption: value and the direction for it but be

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.800
Caption: very careful that you&#39;re applying them

00:40:31.199 --> 00:40:35.199

Caption: and the reading list which covers a lot

00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:54.640
Caption: of the material from today&#39;s talk

00:40:52.639 --> 00:40:57.439
Caption: what i&#39;ll do is questions i&#39;ll take them

00:40:54.639 --> 00:40:59.439
