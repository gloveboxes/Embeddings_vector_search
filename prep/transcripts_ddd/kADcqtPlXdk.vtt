00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:10.218
Caption: so good morning everyone welcome to DVD

00:00:07.818 --> 00:00:12.559
Caption: per and it&#39;s certainly nice to visit

00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:15.168
Caption: this part of the country I find get over

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.848
Caption: here a few times a year but the

00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:21.309
Caption: conference like this is is really good

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.560
Caption: today we&#39;re going to talk about

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:27.409
Caption: Raspberry Pi and Internet of Things but

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:30.229
Caption: here&#39;s my problem so far we all enjoyed

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:32.058
Caption: the keynote and how am I supposed to

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.889
Caption: follow a dynamic presentation like that

00:00:32.058 --> 00:00:38.448
Caption: so it&#39;s going to go downhill from here

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:40.220
Caption: going to happen what we do first is this

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.930
Caption: new technology the sponsors for the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.048
Caption: event in particular the planning partner

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.699
Caption: so Bank West and Microsoft and guru I

00:00:45.048 --> 00:00:48.650
Caption: have a check make sure I saying them

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.019
Caption: properly earlier because without those

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.548
Caption: guys events like this can&#39;t happen but

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.979
Caption: more importantly thank you to you guys

00:00:52.548 --> 00:00:57.250
Caption: because there&#39;s no point having great

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.720
Caption: sponsors if people don&#39;t turn up so and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.279
Caption: you guys need a big round of applause as

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.380
Caption: well sponsor is one thing the most

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:09.199
Caption: important time of the day is the after

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:10.368
Caption: party and them Express are proud to be

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:12.019
Caption: supporting that afterparty

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.399
Caption: and let me show how many people can get

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:16.398
Caption: to it it&#39;s going to be a lot of fun

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.750
Caption: and we&#39;re going to give away so my talk

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.149
Caption: today doesn&#39;t include anything about

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.009
Caption: Derek&#39;s press but if anybody has any

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.509
Caption: questions or be around all day and more

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.029
Caption: than have to answer things just not for

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:30.909
Caption: the next 40 minutes and I think that

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:30.908
Caption: this was typical developer part of my

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:35.779
Caption: quickly pro to myself I&#39;m Russia I&#39;ve

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:39.828
Caption: been a Technical Evangelist for

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:41.809
Caption: DevExpress for four years now and before

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.670
Caption: that I ran and still owns a software

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:45.798
Caption: company in Brisbane I&#39;ve been a

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:48.888
Caption: developer for over 26 years which makes

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.350
Caption: me feel really really old I&#39;m a

00:01:48.888 --> 00:01:53.388
Caption: Microsoft Azure MVP as you learn Asia

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:55.069
Caption: which ever we want to say I&#39;ve been that

00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:57.379
Caption: now but she is and that&#39;s pretty

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.679
Caption: exciting anybody that wants information

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:03.919
Caption: on the MVP program rule number one is

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.049
Caption: violent wild rice paid for emails I&#39;m

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:07.429
Caption: also a trainer with winter right now on

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.708
Caption: different technologies in particular

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.270
Caption: mobile things like iOS so in my

00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:14.869
Caption: development career I&#39;ve tried to focus a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.309
Caption: lot on mobile development sweet humanize

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.489
Caption: the whole thing just it&#39;s one thing for

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.949
Caption: guys to stand up here

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.040
Caption: talk about certain technologies of

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:25.979
Caption: America 18 years on 505 I&#39;m also the

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:27.449
Caption: president of a local brought them so you

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.769
Caption: know life can be quite busy when you&#39;re

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.629
Caption: traveling and fitting all those things

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.790
Caption: in thankfully almost children are adults

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.740
Caption: which again makes me feel really old

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:39.599
Caption: today&#39;s agenda we&#39;re going to have a

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.389
Caption: quick look at what IOT actually means

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.220
Caption: and then start talking about things like

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.259
Caption: the raspberry pie and how can you use

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.270
Caption: the diet II will talk about some

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:50.699
Caption: practical projects and then how you can

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.290
Caption: actually get started and then I&#39;ve got

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.539
Caption: some links which are useful resources

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:58.889
Caption: and then we can open up questions as

00:02:54.539 --> 00:03:01.379
Caption: long as you promise to be nice when the

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:03.419
Caption: actual talk was accepted it&#39;s suddenly

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.220
Caption: thinking what&#39;s the goal for a roomful

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:08.270
Caption: of people that have come in given up

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.520
Caption: their Saturday what&#39;s to take away my

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.470
Caption: number one goal is to leave you with a

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.169
Caption: pink interest that you will actually

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.479
Caption: want to go away and start looking at IOT

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:22.259
Caption: and in particular raspberry pi I need to

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:24.720
Caption: have the devices that connect to IOT for

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:26.819
Caption: me it was one thing to go and buy around

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.520
Caption: revival my first one in the UK probably

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.050
Caption: five years ago now and it was a Saturday

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.090
Caption: shop I said everybody look I&#39;ve been

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.889
Caption: around the pike if the three years I

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:37.830
Caption: didn&#39;t boot it this is like on the

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:39.630
Caption: Raspberry Pi so it&#39;s one of those things

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.040
Caption: quite awful we want to get we want to

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.110
Caption: look at technologies we want to start

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:45.750
Caption: playing with things but sometimes you

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.119
Caption: just buy it for the old shell target

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.979
Caption: trip so I want to change you can bug

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:52.339
Caption: that so the philosophy land change that

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.509
Caption: today and the second part of my goal was

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:56.309
Caption: because of the coolness of the

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.509
Caption: technology somebody is going to come up

00:03:56.309 --> 00:04:00.239
Caption: with a million-dollar idea

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:02.939
Caption: and retirement I take donations if that

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.919
Caption: happens okay big point about any of

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:10.559
Caption: those things work so what do you need to

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:14.639
Caption: know the things and I thought maybe this

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:21.089
Caption: way to talk about what it is is what

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:23.910
Caption: it&#39;s not the IOT is not a ubiquitous or

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:25.519
Caption: pervasive computing method it&#39;s not a

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.100
Caption: protocol

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:31.229
Caption: IOT is not a communication technology or

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.880
Caption: an embedded device of rivers of

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.350
Caption: as per say and it&#39;s not the applications

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.300
Caption: bisexual definition the Internet of

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.820
Caption: Things is a global network

00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:44.690
Caption: infrastructure linking physical and

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.720
Caption: virtual objects using cloud computing

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.519
Caption: data capture and network communications

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.369
Caption: it allows devices to communicate with

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:55.619
Caption: each other access information on the

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:58.589
Caption: Internet strawed store and retrieve data

00:04:55.619 --> 00:05:00.540
Caption: and then interact with users creating a

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:03.589
Caption: smarter evasive and always connected

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.490
Caption: infrastructure now when we talk about

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:07.470
Caption: accessing information on the network

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:10.319
Caption: we&#39;re not just talking about physical

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.489
Caption: devices working with relays buttons

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.130
Caption: those sorts of things

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:17.279
Caption: it can also be information like tweets

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.410
Caption: so having an IOT of the structure you

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:21.600
Caption: can have you know the lights turn on

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.940
Caption: because suddenly mention something in a

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.700
Caption: tweet so you get a big picture of these

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.580
Caption: things or you can do small projects but

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:37.410
Caption: the point is there&#39;s so many moving

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:40.470
Caption: parts to I achieve he mentioned cloud

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:44.010
Caption: computing now obviously as a Microsoft

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:47.040
Caption: Azure MVP I&#39;m going to mention Asia it

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.450
Caption: makes the points that way for those that

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:55.649
Caption: quick show of hands who&#39;s playground

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:57.930
Caption: imagine AWS pretty pretty balanced I&#39;m a

00:05:55.649 --> 00:06:00.690
Caption: big fan if you haven&#39;t already got an

00:05:57.929 --> 00:06:02.549
Caption: account but you can get a free one and a

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.760
Caption: lot of people didn&#39;t think that cloud

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:09.289
Caption: computing has to cost a lot of money my

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.290
Caption: system gets your pages

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.670
Caption: I couldn&#39;t risk you guys killing a

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:22.199
Caption: little backwards oh I&#39;m working on iron

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.290
Caption: shared advice somewhere anything can

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.290
Caption: happen

00:06:25.549 --> 00:06:30.690
Caption: okay so once you sign up as you create

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:35.160
Caption: your account it&#39;s really simple to avoid

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:39.119
Caption: a IOT hub and fact you get started you

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.220
Caption: click on that beautiful but there&#39;s a

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:42.690
Caption: simple thing quietiy hub and you can

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.369
Caption: deploy them and that start setting up

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.440
Caption: your in points now we are going to go

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:49.220
Caption: into too much technical depth here time

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.660
Caption: is too short but one of the local MVP is

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:55.200
Caption: Martin Abbott wrote a really good

00:06:51.660 --> 00:07:01.529
Caption: article about setting up as random IOT

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:04.410
Caption: so I&#39;ve got links for these things later

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:07.019
Caption: on as well but he&#39;s at his blog posts

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:10.230
Caption: Abbott thought as your web sites dotnet

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:13.829
Caption: he details a talk that he did in a local

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:16.110
Caption: computer group how to deploy what&#39;s

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:17.939
Caption: involved we need to do set up your

00:07:16.109 --> 00:07:20.729
Caption: device we&#39;re going to cover some of this

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:24.420
Caption: in today&#39;s session and then he set up a

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.890
Caption: sprinkler system connected to NASA etc

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.900
Caption: so there&#39;s certainly a lot of

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:37.590
Caption: information and ways that you can start

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:40.350
Caption: doing that inside a Joe so what about

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:43.079
Caption: the Raspberry Pi well over the years

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.429
Caption: those are big hands head start with this

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:49.939
Caption: little company with this organization

00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:49.940
Caption: invented a small powered cheap piecing

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:56.099
Caption: again what we&#39;ll do is test start with

00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:59.939
Caption: what the Raspberry Pi is not and it&#39;s

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.500
Caption: not Arduino and some people so say well

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.360
Caption: the to the same thing you&#39;ve got this

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.739
Caption: little oddly no device little board

00:08:03.359 --> 00:08:05.509
Caption: you&#39;ve got a Raspberry Pi what&#39;s the

00:08:04.739 --> 00:08:09.709
Caption: difference

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:11.580
Caption: I&#39;m hoping this is Fred this is my robot

00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:13.319
Caption: unfortunately Fred had a bit of an

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:16.819
Caption: accident recently he fell off the desk

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:20.600
Caption: and so his is very delicate right now

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:22.670
Caption: fred is built on an Arduino board okay

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.890
Caption: so under at the bottom here we&#39;ve got an

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:28.640
Caption: Arduino board controlling a series of

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:32.540
Caption: Knossos and Fred&#39;s normal job and blue

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.950
Caption: to head yet is to control or to tell me

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.779
Caption: what&#39;s happening in my security system

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.660
Caption: so friendships on my desk

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.220
Caption: anything happens at home with my home

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:43.009
Caption: automation which is connected with IOT

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:47.089
Caption: etc people actually tell me he moved his

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:49.100
Caption: head and we&#39;re going to try to say

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:53.090
Caption: Elliott he almost didn&#39;t make it all the

00:08:49.099 --> 00:08:56.059
Caption: way over here but make sure that

00:08:53.090 --> 00:09:01.940
Caption: frequent talk so and I just simply want

00:08:56.059 --> 00:09:03.320
Caption: to use it as a quick example of the use

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.119
Caption: of Y as we know and then I&#39;m going to

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.369
Caption: explain some of what happens with the

00:09:05.119 --> 00:09:13.429
Caption: other winner boards he has a nervous tic

00:09:07.369 --> 00:09:16.099
Caption: right now okay so this is some of the

00:09:13.429 --> 00:09:20.029
Caption: software that is created for teaching

00:09:16.099 --> 00:09:22.940
Caption: children robotics and I just want to run

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:25.130
Caption: out one particular program and this is

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.830
Caption: just straight USB connection serial

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:32.150
Caption: controlling that are doing a device as I

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:33.890
Caption: move the mouse around there we go

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:36.980
Caption: this is usually a head pulled up right

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:41.330
Caption: now let sounds you&#39;re going to talk

00:09:36.979 --> 00:09:43.940
Caption: cable yet okay good what one thing that

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:47.570
Caption: did break was a little speaker so there

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:49.760
Caption: we go rocket head and but it is a great

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:55.880
Caption: example of what to be achieved with the

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:58.000
Caption: other you know microprocessor okay there

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.000
Caption: we go

00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:04.639
Caption: so what&#39;s the difference between the

00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:09.279
Caption: Arduino or let&#39;s press I can talk more

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:11.390
Caption: about the Arduino and explain what it is

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.430
Caption: the opening that is an open source

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:16.369
Caption: prototyping platform based on an

00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:17.750
Caption: easy-to-use hardware software interviews

00:10:16.369 --> 00:10:20.630
Caption: being the fact that it&#39;s one simple

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:22.309
Caption: board with some can put out the pins now

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.619
Caption: there&#39;s more variable reading puts

00:10:22.309 --> 00:10:27.320
Caption: whether it be from sensors fingers on

00:10:24.619 --> 00:10:28.940
Caption: buttons everything including because

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.648
Caption: we&#39;re going to dive do things like

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.778
Caption: Twitter messages or other incoming

00:10:30.648 --> 00:10:34.698
Caption: courses and then once it takes an input

00:10:32.778 --> 00:10:38.659
Caption: it can actually do something with it

00:10:34.698 --> 00:10:40.958
Caption: being the output so you can control the

00:10:38.659 --> 00:10:43.789
Caption: motors the servos lights other things

00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:45.618
Caption: with the Arduino it&#39;s based on their own

00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:47.688
Caption: programming language and they&#39;ve got

00:10:45.619 --> 00:10:50.269
Caption: their own idea cetera really cheap to

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:54.050
Caption: get into and cool but at the end of the

00:10:50.268 --> 00:10:57.739
Caption: day there&#39;s Fred with a nose my crater

00:10:54.049 --> 00:11:00.289
Caption: nose was too at the end of the day how

00:10:57.739 --> 00:11:03.979
Caption: does that differ to the pie and why do I

00:11:00.289 --> 00:11:06.888
Caption: prefer it whether the pie so the micro

00:11:03.979 --> 00:11:09.739
Caption: is whether being a micro controller is a

00:11:06.888 --> 00:11:12.198
Caption: simple computer you can only run one

00:11:09.739 --> 00:11:14.989
Caption: program at one time over and over and

00:11:12.198 --> 00:11:16.909
Caption: over it&#39;s very easy to use simple to

00:11:14.989 --> 00:11:19.458
Caption: setup and run play words whereas the pie

00:11:16.909 --> 00:11:21.258
Caption: is a general-purpose computer usually

00:11:19.458 --> 00:11:23.328
Caption: with a Linux operating system

00:11:21.258 --> 00:11:25.118
Caption: although that&#39;s now changing and it&#39;s

00:11:23.328 --> 00:11:27.799
Caption: capable of running multiple programs

00:11:25.119 --> 00:11:31.160
Caption: that will making it more complicated or

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:33.708
Caption: complex based in that winner so enter

00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:37.428
Caption: the pipe and this one here is actually

00:11:33.708 --> 00:11:40.638
Caption: the pi3 that we&#39;re going to be giving

00:11:37.429 --> 00:11:42.470
Caption: away in the starter kit today but just

00:11:40.638 --> 00:11:46.878
Caption: take your top off we can see that it is

00:11:42.469 --> 00:11:48.258
Caption: a credit card sized machine I&#39;m going to

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:49.790
Caption: break down the anatomy shortly on the

00:11:48.258 --> 00:11:53.208
Caption: slide as well but it&#39;s a simple little

00:11:49.789 --> 00:11:56.869
Caption: device this is an official PI case wraps

00:11:53.208 --> 00:11:58.909
Caption: it up nicely and being a low powered it

00:11:56.869 --> 00:12:01.489
Caption: means that you can run it really easily

00:11:58.909 --> 00:12:03.138
Caption: with other things doesn&#39;t have to plug

00:12:01.489 --> 00:12:04.909
Caption: into the mains all the time but what&#39;s

00:12:03.138 --> 00:12:09.318
Caption: really interesting about it are all the

00:12:04.909 --> 00:12:12.018
Caption: different slots and devices it&#39;s capable

00:12:09.318 --> 00:12:18.378
Caption: of some quite amazing things it runs a

00:12:12.018 --> 00:12:21.849
Caption: version of Linux so this here is

00:12:18.379 --> 00:12:21.850
Caption: actually a Raspberry Pi

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:27.419
Caption: is the cake itself is designed by a

00:12:25.289 --> 00:12:30.119
Caption: British company called pipe up and they

00:12:27.419 --> 00:12:31.888
Caption: you want it to give you a way of working

00:12:30.119 --> 00:12:33.328
Caption: with a pie because my spice did on the

00:12:31.888 --> 00:12:36.028
Caption: shelf you&#39;ve got to hook up a power

00:12:33.328 --> 00:12:38.369
Caption: supply you&#39;ve got a bun HDMI cable

00:12:36.028 --> 00:12:39.559
Caption: display etc thinking about with the idea

00:12:38.369 --> 00:12:42.268
Caption: that you know what

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:44.429
Caption: how much more use can you get if it&#39;s

00:12:42.268 --> 00:12:46.588
Caption: self-contained now we&#39;ve got the

00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:49.229
Caption: Raspberry Pi sitting here we&#39;ve got the

00:12:46.588 --> 00:12:51.619
Caption: battery behind keyboard mouse this is

00:12:49.229 --> 00:12:54.148
Caption: running raspberry n&#39; which is the

00:12:51.619 --> 00:12:57.388
Caption: preferred default operating system port

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:59.219
Caption: and I&#39;ve also got as well as the

00:12:57.388 --> 00:13:01.289
Caption: controller something called the part of

00:12:59.219 --> 00:13:03.958
Caption: expansion board which allows me to play

00:13:01.289 --> 00:13:05.898
Caption: around with electronics and very much in

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:10.669
Caption: the same way you can do with the arduino

00:13:05.898 --> 00:13:13.919
Caption: one point tonight do not take pi top and

00:13:10.669 --> 00:13:16.768
Caption: the bag of electronics on an airplane

00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:18.119
Caption: and firing like the presentation it

00:13:16.768 --> 00:13:19.679
Caption: doesn&#39;t go down very well

00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:22.559
Caption: people start freaking out when you&#39;re

00:13:19.679 --> 00:13:25.528
Caption: putting cables and LEDs and doing this

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:27.380
Caption: on a plane okay okay

00:13:25.528 --> 00:13:29.398
Caption: learn that lesson the hard way

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.750
Caption: thankfully was domestic not

00:13:29.398 --> 00:13:32.388
Caption: international flight otherwise that

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.768
Caption: might not be here anyway

00:13:32.388 --> 00:13:38.369
Caption: what&#39;s really cool when this particular

00:13:34.768 --> 00:13:41.489
Caption: setup that I like the as well as

00:13:38.369 --> 00:13:44.188
Caption: obviously affordable I can pull the SD

00:13:41.489 --> 00:13:45.719
Caption: card out and put another operating

00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:47.399
Caption: system in there if I the one that&#39;s on

00:13:45.719 --> 00:13:49.588
Caption: here is running three operating systems

00:13:47.398 --> 00:13:51.599
Caption: so one of the cool things with for every

00:13:49.588 --> 00:13:55.278
Caption: PI I can use it as a desktop computer

00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:58.018
Caption: with processing spreadsheets browser etc

00:13:55.278 --> 00:13:59.909
Caption: or if you use it as a media center and

00:13:58.018 --> 00:14:02.518
Caption: one of the dishes I&#39;ve got on the card

00:13:59.909 --> 00:14:04.500
Caption: allows me to have a non-smoking this set

00:14:02.518 --> 00:14:07.469
Caption: up but you imagine just a little box a

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.778
Caption: really silent media center brain what I

00:14:07.469 --> 00:14:11.929
Caption: want so lots of different uses and we&#39;ll

00:14:09.778 --> 00:14:14.130
Caption: talk about some more of that shortly

00:14:11.929 --> 00:14:15.778
Caption: we&#39;ll come back to this device because

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:20.338
Caption: we&#39;re set up to do some programming as

00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:23.039
Caption: well at the same time the PI can also be

00:14:20.338 --> 00:14:25.888
Caption: used well first of all when the

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:28.648
Caption: Raspberry Pi foundation started they set

00:14:25.888 --> 00:14:30.328
Caption: up with a goal was actually designed so

00:14:28.648 --> 00:14:31.479
Caption: that they could see children all over

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:34.268
Caption: the world

00:14:31.479 --> 00:14:36.219
Caption: program on a device that was cheap so

00:14:34.268 --> 00:14:39.309
Caption: therefore affordable apparently there is

00:14:36.219 --> 00:14:41.379
Caption: a will shortage of programmers of a

00:14:39.309 --> 00:14:44.229
Caption: designing purpose you have lots of

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:46.419
Caption: people here but that new generation of

00:14:44.229 --> 00:14:48.989
Caption: children coming through there&#39;s lots of

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:52.659
Caption: programs being written and programmed in

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:54.429
Caption: teaching not software to educate

00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:56.379
Caption: children on on the joys of software

00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:58.179
Caption: development when everybody here does it

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.898
Caption: for a passion you don&#39;t do it just

00:14:58.179 --> 00:15:04.088
Caption: because you need to get paid right at

00:15:01.898 --> 00:15:07.268
Caption: the end of the day we&#39;re a special Bunch

00:15:04.088 --> 00:15:10.000
Caption: we take take an idea of nothing and

00:15:07.268 --> 00:15:13.599
Caption: create something from it so

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.698
Caption: interestingly watching the keynote and I

00:15:13.599 --> 00:15:17.768
Caption: was in real estate back in 2002 I was

00:15:15.698 --> 00:15:21.338
Caption: doing software development in a building

00:15:17.768 --> 00:15:24.099
Caption: company and I had to came up with two

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:24.760
Caption: concepts that we wanted to do inside

00:15:24.099 --> 00:15:28.088
Caption: their company

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:31.000
Caption: one was holographic display of brand-new

00:15:28.088 --> 00:15:32.409
Caption: houses on flat pieces of land so people

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.419
Caption: could see what their new houses in look

00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:37.419
Caption: like and the second was an automated

00:15:34.419 --> 00:15:39.789
Caption: replaying machine at the time I was told

00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:42.909
Caption: by my partners don&#39;t be stupid to never

00:15:39.789 --> 00:15:45.338
Caption: happen hololens and other technologies

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:47.500
Caption: means that people do now and in front of

00:15:45.338 --> 00:15:49.448
Caption: their newly purchased piece of land and

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.609
Caption: have a look at what house design is

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:54.009
Caption: going to be like that we&#39;re talking ten

00:15:51.609 --> 00:15:55.388
Caption: plus years and recently I learned there

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:58.088
Caption: to come here that you released an

00:15:55.388 --> 00:15:59.919
Caption: automatic brick laying machine so either

00:15:58.088 --> 00:16:06.239
Caption: of those I managed to patent to the

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:10.510
Caption: service for here the anatomy of a PI

00:16:06.239 --> 00:16:13.239
Caption: runs on a brooklyn quad-core cpu this is

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:15.069
Caption: the current model of pi 3 oil B you can

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:18.429
Caption: see that&#39;s got onboard bluetooth onboard

00:16:15.068 --> 00:16:20.259
Caption: Wi-Fi the micro SD card slot is where

00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:22.869
Caption: the operating system and all sorts runs

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:25.059
Caption: from it&#39;s going to display for one of my

00:16:22.869 --> 00:16:28.419
Caption: setups actually has a 7 inch touchscreen

00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:31.898
Caption: display which is great for in-car audio

00:16:28.419 --> 00:16:35.888
Caption: or other adaptive things and mounted on

00:16:31.898 --> 00:16:38.229
Caption: a wall the micro USB the full citation e

00:16:35.888 --> 00:16:42.130
Caption: paint the mi video output it&#39;s got a

00:16:38.229 --> 00:16:43.630
Caption: camera port now in term this fit is done

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.070
Caption: by the way if you want to set up a

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:48.599
Caption: Raspberry Pi and have it

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:54.729
Caption: it&#39;s a little battery-operated projector

00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:58.869
Caption: with keyboard maps and kind of like this

00:16:54.729 --> 00:17:01.148
Caption: now but this is a Raspberry Pi 3 that

00:16:58.869 --> 00:17:02.739
Caption: this little thing controls now what is

00:17:01.148 --> 00:17:05.948
Caption: boosted this one&#39;s running Windows 10

00:17:02.739 --> 00:17:07.688
Caption: IOT core ok once it&#39;s actually boots it

00:17:05.948 --> 00:17:10.150
Caption: I can now control it from any of my

00:17:07.688 --> 00:17:12.578
Caption: other devices but this one&#39;s got an 8

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.828
Caption: megapixel camera in it is using a

00:17:12.578 --> 00:17:17.708
Caption: package called a PI blocks which

00:17:14.828 --> 00:17:20.198
Caption: acceptable Lego style box is and this is

00:17:17.708 --> 00:17:24.068
Caption: part of my security setup so consider

00:17:20.198 --> 00:17:26.918
Caption: Michelle low-power and take photos what

00:17:24.068 --> 00:17:31.329
Caption: I want mounted in the office etc so

00:17:26.918 --> 00:17:32.979
Caption: we&#39;re talking devices that cost $50 $20

00:17:31.329 --> 00:17:35.949
Caption: for a camera and you&#39;ve got a fully

00:17:32.979 --> 00:17:40.119
Caption: fledged computer with a lot of

00:17:35.949 --> 00:17:44.349
Caption: capability we&#39;ve also got four USB ports

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:49.168
Caption: the Ethernet port and the extended you

00:17:44.349 --> 00:17:49.168
Caption: go Bridge for controlling other devices

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:54.790
Caption: so what about operating systems well

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:57.640
Caption: first of all most people working with it

00:17:54.790 --> 00:18:00.070
Caption: there&#39;s riparian and one of those exam

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:03.280
Caption: researchers like 28 plus versions of

00:18:00.069 --> 00:18:08.139
Caption: Linux available for the part one company

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:10.270
Caption: released recently a nap rate system

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:13.479
Caption: version of the OS so they&#39;re basically

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:16.150
Caption: figure indicating how the stack of

00:18:13.479 --> 00:18:17.949
Caption: drives low power or otherwise whatever

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.260
Caption: you&#39;ve got a network storage solution

00:18:17.949 --> 00:18:22.808
Caption: that is super cheap and you can be set

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.750
Caption: up in raid so again whether it be

00:18:22.808 --> 00:18:27.158
Caption: something like this perfect um project

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.168
Caption: imagine that with a media center high to

00:18:27.159 --> 00:18:32.049
Caption: running media center high running is a

00:18:29.168 --> 00:18:36.009
Caption: nice rate server and you&#39;ve got things

00:18:32.048 --> 00:18:38.408
Caption: that previously were quite expensive I&#39;m

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:40.089
Caption: running Windows 10 IOT core on this one

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:41.799
Caption: and that&#39;s a lot of fun

00:18:40.089 --> 00:18:44.650
Caption: and we don&#39;t have a look at some

00:18:41.798 --> 00:18:46.298
Caption: different projects lab I was reading

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.190
Caption: recently as well where Google are

00:18:46.298 --> 00:18:51.369
Caption: talking about releasing a version of

00:18:48.189 --> 00:18:52.719
Caption: Android dedicated to PI which is you

00:18:51.369 --> 00:18:54.158
Caption: know what exciting there are some hacks

00:18:52.719 --> 00:18:55.719
Caption: you can do now and actually get Android

00:18:54.159 --> 00:18:57.570
Caption: running on it but we&#39;re talking about a

00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:59.760
Caption: dedicated version

00:18:57.569 --> 00:19:02.399
Caption: Landru it so that will open things up

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.619
Caption: interesting as well not sure that Apple

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.390
Caption: want to do that way because I mentioned

00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:11.430
Caption: I think they&#39;ve got a super expensive

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:16.320
Caption: one called an Apple TV right so what

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:18.720
Caption: about real world projects one of the

00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:20.309
Caption: first thing is that pie owners tend to

00:19:18.719 --> 00:19:23.159
Caption: try and play with the spaceship they&#39;ve

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:26.040
Caption: got a bit of handyman work and human is

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.900
Caption: a smart Merritt and such an interesting

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:30.300
Caption: concept you buy a couple pieces of

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:33.239
Caption: mirror usually the acrylic one so you

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:35.130
Caption: can shape it better pros loves you buy a

00:19:33.239 --> 00:19:36.750
Caption: cheap one of them and you mount the

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:39.900
Caption: mirror on top of the monitor and you

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:42.239
Caption: mount the Raspberry Pi onto that hook it

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.550
Caption: up it&#39;s got Wi-Fi anyway and you&#39;ve got

00:19:42.239 --> 00:19:46.229
Caption: a smart Bureau so those times where

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.880
Caption: we&#39;re seeing those movies and the guys

00:19:46.229 --> 00:19:49.049
Caption: looking you know having a shave on a

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.760
Caption: morning where the ladies are getting

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.260
Caption: ready and you can actually be looking at

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.239
Caption: your Twitter feed look at your emails

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.589
Caption: you can do other things certain

00:19:54.239 --> 00:19:58.199
Caption: companies have gone further and put

00:19:55.589 --> 00:19:59.909
Caption: camera interaction with it so that they

00:19:58.199 --> 00:20:03.929
Caption: can get feedback and they can talk the

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:06.720
Caption: UI in that way or simply now that that

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:08.070
Caption: didn&#39;t expert in thing to the next page

00:20:06.719 --> 00:20:10.589
Caption: to other things so there&#39;s so many

00:20:08.069 --> 00:20:16.109
Caption: different options there another

00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:19.229
Caption: gentleman in island came up with the

00:20:16.109 --> 00:20:21.479
Caption: idea of building a camera rig that was

00:20:19.229 --> 00:20:24.929
Caption: the Raspberry Pi controlling the runners

00:20:21.479 --> 00:20:27.390
Caption: and also the caption he was doing a

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:29.369
Caption: delayed capture shots so that was

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:32.729
Caption: another way of doing it lots of

00:20:29.369 --> 00:20:35.609
Caption: different ideas in fact smart Maris

00:20:32.729 --> 00:20:38.309
Caption: media senses the nap service just

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:40.079
Caption: ascended server sprinkler control system

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:41.850
Caption: home automation the only thing that

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:44.729
Caption: limits what you can do with a PI is

00:20:41.849 --> 00:20:47.429
Caption: going to be your thinking so then how&#39;d

00:20:44.729 --> 00:20:49.469
Caption: you actually get started with develop

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:52.440
Caption: into a fire you can think about what

00:20:49.469 --> 00:20:55.520
Caption: operating system you want what you

00:20:52.439 --> 00:20:55.519
Caption: actually want to achieve with it

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.950
Caption: if you talk about Windows 10 IOT core

00:20:57.959 --> 00:21:02.349
Caption: once you visit device

00:20:59.949 --> 00:21:04.599
Caption: it&#39;s a device you can control it but

00:21:02.349 --> 00:21:06.669
Caption: it&#39;s not the same as running Linux

00:21:04.599 --> 00:21:08.679
Caption: science so it&#39;s not windows came that

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.910
Caption: you can run software do things it&#39;s just

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:14.890
Caption: the core libraries where the browser

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:16.119
Caption: interfaces we saw we&#39;re going to do is

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:19.719
Caption: step you through what&#39;s actually

00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:22.780
Caption: involved in building a Windows 10 high

00:21:19.719 --> 00:21:27.130
Caption: and then how you can connect to it and

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:30.900
Caption: do other cool things hopefully the

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:38.650
Caption: resolution is okay so there&#39;s a

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:40.180
Caption: application called the IOT dashboard if

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.710
Caption: you&#39;ve actually got any devices running

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.360
Caption: in network you can administer them

00:21:41.709 --> 00:21:45.359
Caption: directly through there&#39;s now a couple of

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:49.209
Caption: different downloadable products or

00:21:45.359 --> 00:21:50.559
Caption: looking at your devices this one is one

00:21:49.209 --> 00:21:52.569
Caption: of the lakes ponds from Microsoft is

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.480
Caption: also located in the setup we can see

00:21:52.569 --> 00:21:58.179
Caption: that right now I&#39;ve got dead PI and it&#39;s

00:21:55.479 --> 00:22:01.089
Caption: on the same shared network which is a

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:04.480
Caption: challenge when you&#39;re on mobile and if I

00:22:01.089 --> 00:22:06.579
Caption: double click I can do to change settings

00:22:04.479 --> 00:22:10.059
Caption: here quite actually open the device in

00:22:06.579 --> 00:22:13.479
Caption: the browser what&#39;s really going to lie

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:16.600
Caption: at 10 I of T 10 core Windows IOT temple

00:22:13.479 --> 00:22:19.150
Caption: is the fact that you can run any uwp

00:22:16.599 --> 00:22:22.299
Caption: application on it so give a visual

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:25.719
Caption: studio and you install the Windows 10

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:28.720
Caption: SDKs you just open up a new universal

00:22:25.719 --> 00:22:31.059
Caption: Windows platform project and you can

00:22:28.719 --> 00:22:34.059
Caption: deploy deploy that project straight to

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:36.250
Caption: your device obviously you may want some

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.660
Caption: UI just fine because it&#39;s got aged in

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.910
Caption: mind or if you&#39;re talking to other

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.950
Caption: devices you can just have it talk to the

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:45.729
Caption: devices but it&#39;s that simple Visual

00:22:41.949 --> 00:22:49.829
Caption: Studio SDK and you can connect now there

00:22:45.729 --> 00:22:53.919
Caption: is a great sample tutorial on the

00:22:49.829 --> 00:22:55.630
Caption: Microsoft website which talks about

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.859
Caption: again I&#39;ll post these links but it talks

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.930
Caption: about how to code to see our project

00:22:56.859 --> 00:23:01.599
Caption: step you through everything you need to

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:03.640
Caption: do have suckers down on how to do the

00:23:01.599 --> 00:23:06.760
Caption: deployment and debugging so it&#39;s a great

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:09.900
Caption: resource stop it very simple to get used

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.900
Caption: to get up speed with

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:21.500
Caption: what you&#39;ll notice here that&#39;s in work

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:24.049
Caption: good is inside this dashboard we&#39;ve got

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.689
Caption: access to the device itself so now once

00:23:24.048 --> 00:23:28.579
Caption: it&#39;s booted I&#39;m happy and come through I

00:23:26.689 --> 00:23:30.829
Caption: can look at what apps are installed I

00:23:28.579 --> 00:23:33.140
Caption: can install new apps I can traverse the

00:23:30.829 --> 00:23:35.239
Caption: file explorer I look at the processes I

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.829
Caption: can see how it&#39;s performing and you can

00:23:35.239 --> 00:23:39.199
Caption: see this is in real time this is the

00:23:36.829 --> 00:23:40.969
Caption: blue little device here but I get that

00:23:39.199 --> 00:23:44.418
Caption: the screen is blank you can see how the

00:23:40.969 --> 00:23:46.640
Caption: RAM is performing everything down to

00:23:44.418 --> 00:23:47.989
Caption: controls on what Bluetooth audio is set

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.719
Caption: up on there you can run the Windows

00:23:47.989 --> 00:23:52.969
Caption: updates we&#39;re warning it does take a

00:23:50.719 --> 00:23:55.640
Caption: long time or when does tend to update if

00:23:52.969 --> 00:23:57.829
Caption: you thought it was hard with a laptop so

00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.558
Caption: here is in our heart the other day for

00:23:57.829 --> 00:24:01.969
Caption: the latest update so it downloads it and

00:24:00.558 --> 00:24:05.178
Caption: then you just sit watching the little

00:24:01.969 --> 00:24:09.260
Caption: cogs go around now now so we have

00:24:05.178 --> 00:24:13.969
Caption: something else to do you can also access

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:16.219
Caption: it with an IEP so once again once a

00:24:13.969 --> 00:24:19.989
Caption: device or range of devices of booted it

00:24:16.219 --> 00:24:19.989
Caption: makes it really really easy to work with

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:40.080
Caption: Safari wants to access things now now

00:24:35.479 --> 00:24:42.140
Caption: now ok so here at quick show of hands to

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:49.949
Caption: shop developers or Microsoft stack

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:53.070
Caption: versus Linux other ok so it&#39;s really

00:24:49.949 --> 00:24:55.349
Caption: balanced and you want to get em C sharp

00:24:53.069 --> 00:24:58.649
Caption: our visual studio that&#39;s great if you&#39;re

00:24:55.349 --> 00:25:01.400
Caption: more of a Linux guy depends again what

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:05.309
Caption: you want to do I love the fact that this

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:07.410
Caption: little $50.00 computer I can see it with

00:25:05.308 --> 00:25:10.678
Caption: and I can actually use something built

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:14.130
Caption: II&#39;s in here so there&#39;s blue Java green

00:25:10.678 --> 00:25:14.849
Caption: foot there&#39;s piping ideas all part of

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.619
Caption: that this stroke

00:25:14.849 --> 00:25:18.599
Caption: I just get set and write code if I want

00:25:16.619 --> 00:25:21.298
Caption: that&#39;s cool if I&#39;m talking about doing

00:25:18.599 --> 00:25:24.959
Caption: some real apps on the actual running the

00:25:21.298 --> 00:25:29.849
Caption: next but as far as IOT one of my

00:25:24.959 --> 00:25:33.449
Caption: favorite products for working with IOT

00:25:29.849 --> 00:25:35.219
Caption: has got to be mad no dread now what I&#39;m

00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:39.209
Caption: going to try to here and this could go

00:25:35.219 --> 00:25:42.599
Caption: terribly wrong is swap this to that

00:25:39.209 --> 00:25:45.918
Caption: screen so just bear with me a sec try

00:25:42.599 --> 00:25:45.918
Caption: not to kill the robot in the meantime

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:57.449
Caption: spend whether this adapters size a good

00:25:55.209 --> 00:25:59.649
Caption: size

00:25:57.449 --> 00:26:13.000
Caption: everybody is the backside now I don&#39;t do

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:15.820
Caption: it probably not on occasion okay I&#39;ll

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.439
Caption: talk you through no read and I&#39;ll hold

00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:26.678
Caption: the screen up so you can see it just

00:26:17.439 --> 00:26:33.548
Caption: important won&#39;t be on the projector so

00:26:26.678 --> 00:26:36.219
Caption: no no red is a graphical interface for

00:26:33.548 --> 00:26:38.139
Caption: controlling IOT devices it&#39;s going to be

00:26:36.219 --> 00:26:40.239
Caption: one of the simplest ways to get your

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.709
Caption: head around talking to external

00:26:40.239 --> 00:26:42.849
Caption: components because sometimes it&#39;s

00:26:41.709 --> 00:26:44.739
Caption: developed but they&#39;re going to be cool

00:26:42.849 --> 00:26:46.510
Caption: to you know make the motor moves to run

00:26:44.739 --> 00:26:49.178
Caption: a test from a sensor to do something

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:50.949
Caption: else but we&#39;re not really interested in

00:26:49.178 --> 00:26:53.859
Caption: getting to all of the down and dirty
