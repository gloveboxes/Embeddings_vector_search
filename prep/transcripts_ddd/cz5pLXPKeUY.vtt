Caption: PowerPoint live let me tell you a little

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:19.500
Caption: bit about me that&#39;s myself and Donna

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:21.539
Caption: Boyd up here last year talking about

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.759
Caption: product ownership it was our first ever

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:26.458
Caption: conference talk and I&#39;m clearly a

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:28.559
Caption: glutton for punishment so I&#39;m back at it

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:30.839
Caption: I am an idealist

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:33.360
Caption: I never really outgrew that naive little

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:35.399
Caption: girl who wants to adopt old dogs in the

Caption: joined the United Nations

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.119
Caption: but I did realize that the best way for

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:43.679
Caption: me to make change is to focus in on the

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:45.360
Caption: things that I&#39;m good at

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:47.159
Caption: the things that I like doing the things

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.180
Caption: the world needs and things I can get

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.980
Caption: paid for

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:52.319
Caption: and that is focusing in on that

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:54.539
Caption: intersection between business technology

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.279
Caption: and social impact

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:58.139
Caption: it&#39;s because of that I&#39;m incredibly

00:02:56.279 --> 00:03:00.720
Caption: passionate about diversity and inclusion

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.699
Caption: I mean how can I not be but it&#39;s about

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.940
Caption: leveraging diversity and inclusion to

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:08.339
Caption: enable and support

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.419
Caption: sustainable High performing teams and

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.779
Caption: that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re going to talk

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.779
Caption: about today

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.559
Caption: is human

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:19.440
Caption: to learn divine

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:22.259
Caption: hindsight&#39;s always 20 20. if only we had

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.119
Caption: that in 2020

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:27.419
Caption: it&#39;s really difficult to take a moment

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:29.639
Caption: to pause and reflect on difficult times

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.619
Caption: particularly when you&#39;re right in the

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.899
Caption: middle of it now I had a lot of really

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:35.639
Caption: great ideas on how to actually run this

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:37.439
Caption: session you know I had this Vision that

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.300
Caption: I was live facilitating and you were

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.559
Caption: like screaming your frustrations out at

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.479
Caption: me and some of the worst projects that

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:44.098
Caption: you&#39;ve ever been a part of but I wasn&#39;t

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:46.259
Caption: sure that I&#39;d be able to get you angry

00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:47.458
Caption: and then calm again in 20 minutes so you

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.899
Caption: don&#39;t go outside picking fights with

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:51.479
Caption: people

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:53.220
Caption: but also you&#39;re here to listen and to

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:56.098
Caption: learn not to work

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.779
Caption: so I had that session with smaller

00:03:56.098 --> 00:04:00.360
Caption: groups of people who already had a high

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:02.220
Caption: level of psychological safety

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.080
Caption: and these are the four things that we

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.360
Caption: came up with the four top challenges

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.598
Caption: that we&#39;re going to unpack today one by

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.598
Caption: one

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:14.098
Caption: it&#39;s not my job get your remote hands up

00:04:12.238 --> 00:04:16.339
Caption: eye rolls groans if you&#39;ve heard this

00:04:14.098 --> 00:04:16.339
Caption: before

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.040
Caption: well if it&#39;s not your job whose job is

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.559
Caption: it then

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.180
Caption: if you&#39;re hearing this in your Retros or

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:26.160
Caption: in your projects towards the end of a

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:28.679
Caption: reporting cycle or whatever it might be

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.179
Caption: it basically means that there have been

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:32.339
Caption: assumptions that have gone wrong but

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:34.199
Caption: I&#39;ve been proven to be wrong someone has

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:38.119
Caption: assumed that this isn&#39;t part of their

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.119
Caption: role and you have assumed that it is

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.880
Caption: cannot assume

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.720
Caption: that people understand what their role

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.699
Caption: is

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.979
Caption: you cannot assume that people&#39;s

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.800
Caption: interpretation of their role is the same

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.959
Caption: as yours this is especially true for

00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:57.179
Caption: multivendor teams and teams where you

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:59.399
Caption: have a mix of operational project and

00:04:57.179 --> 00:05:01.019
Caption: product people we each have a different

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:02.759
Caption: lens that we bring into what our role

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:05.940
Caption: actually means and what it means to work

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.559
Caption: and how they interact with each other

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.199
Caption: and it&#39;s incredibly important that we

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:12.059
Caption: actually bring ourselves together to get

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.979
Caption: that common understanding about common

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:15.979
Caption: Clarity on how we&#39;ll work together today

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:24.479
Caption: what you need to do is First Steps do we

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.380
Caption: all actually agree on what our problem

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.239
Caption: is

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.800
Caption: do we understand what we&#39;re trying to

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:30.779
Caption: solve why are we even here in the first

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:32.819
Caption: place

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:34.739
Caption: when you have a Clarity or in that then

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.360
Caption: you can do your visioning what&#39;s that

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:38.759
Caption: desired outcome where are we heading to

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:40.978
Caption: what do we want to be in three six

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:42.539
Caption: months years time what are we trying to

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.539
Caption: get to

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.039
Caption: from there you have to understand what

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.779
Caption: are the things that you actually need to

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.940
Caption: do forget your project methodology for a

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:52.079
Caption: moment but what do you actually need to

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.179
Caption: get done

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:55.619
Caption: what&#39;s your value chain

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:57.979
Caption: that&#39;s going to get you to where you

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:57.979
Caption: want to go

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.100
Caption: when you have that value chain

00:06:00.299 --> 00:06:03.659
Caption: understood and broken down as much as

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.459
Caption: you possibly can to get your best

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.440
Caption: estimates from here you can have a look

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:09.000
Caption: around and think and talk about the kind

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.860
Caption: of project methodology you think is

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.679
Caption: better is going to suit your project the

00:06:10.859 --> 00:06:15.359
Caption: best what roles are available to you and

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:18.380
Caption: then you can agree and assign those

00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:18.379
Caption: roles and responsibilities

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.959
Caption: what&#39;s within your remit today

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.880
Caption: now you might be talking to me and like

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:28.259
Caption: might be thinking in your head we&#39;ve

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.880
Caption: done this and there&#39;s still things that

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:32.100
Caption: come up that we don&#39;t know who it

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.600
Caption: belongs to or maybe you&#39;re trying you&#39;re

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.160
Caption: thinking about well the product that

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.800
Caption: we&#39;re working on doesn&#39;t actually have a

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.419
Caption: very you know clearly defined outcome

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:42.119
Caption: well it&#39;s true we don&#39;t have a crystal

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.919
Caption: ball and we don&#39;t know always what&#39;s

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:46.979
Caption: going to come up and potentially derail

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.419
Caption: us on our journey to our end Vision or

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.039
Caption: our end goal

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.119
Caption: this is where you come together as a

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:52.739
Caption: team and you actually talk about the

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.059
Caption: roles that are available to you and your

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:56.220
Caption: team

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:58.679
Caption: what are your experiences in previous

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.940
Caption: projects in previous organizations how

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:02.399
Caption: have you worked with a project sponsored

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.839
Caption: previously what do you expect your

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:05.819
Caption: tester to do

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:07.559
Caption: are there some roles or some

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:09.239
Caption: responsibilities I should say that your

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:11.339
Caption: change manager would traditionally be

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:18.300
Caption: to do that

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:21.479

00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:23.579
Caption: the social contract that you&#39;re forming

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:25.619
Caption: someone clearly did not think it was

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:27.539
Caption: their role to clear the path before

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:30.319

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:30.319
Caption: remarkable outcome

Caption: don&#39;t care how or just make sure that

00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:40.098
Caption: you do

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:44.639
Caption: number two

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.919

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.000

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:50.098

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.199
Caption: introduce a new way of working sorry

00:07:50.098 --> 00:07:53.759
Caption: mate you must be a bit new here we don&#39;t

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:57.080
Caption: really do things that way things have

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:57.080
Caption: been working fine until you came along

00:07:57.679 --> 00:08:02.039
Caption: there&#39;s not enough angry emojis in there

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.500
Caption: but I love it

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:07.319
Caption: it can be pretty tricky to balance

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.119
Caption: Chaos and Order particularly when you&#39;re

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:10.380
Caption: trying to manage the different people&#39;s

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:12.419
Caption: expectations and their different Comfort

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.979
Caption: levels along with the type of project

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:15.419
Caption: methodology that&#39;s going to suit the

00:08:13.979 --> 00:08:16.979
Caption: organization that you&#39;re delivering to

00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:18.720
Caption: where customers are comfortable with

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:21.500
Caption: what your team&#39;s personalities are and

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.500
Caption: so on and so forth

00:08:21.598 --> 00:08:27.378
Caption: often you&#39;ll find people gravitating

00:08:23.459 --> 00:08:27.378
Caption: towards process and

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.440
Caption: um procedures in more like governance

00:08:29.878 --> 00:08:33.239

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.119

00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:38.760
Caption: particularly uncomfortable with chaos

00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:40.739
Caption: as consultants we&#39;re often asked to

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.958
Caption: bring a best practice approach to

00:08:40.739 --> 00:08:45.479
Caption: executing work and it&#39;s fantastic for us

00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.039
Caption: to be able to lean on our experiences

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:49.260
Caption: on what&#39;s worked really well before

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:51.419
Caption: other similar companies or the similar

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.040
Caption: size projects

00:08:51.419 --> 00:08:56.219
Caption: but the thing about software development

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:58.919
Caption: is the sheer number of variables means

00:08:56.219 --> 00:09:01.018
Caption: that well there&#39;s no real silver bullet

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:02.639
Caption: to delivering an outcome

00:09:01.018 --> 00:09:04.320
Caption: there&#39;s so many things that you need to

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.519
Caption: consider when deciding on what&#39;s the

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.600
Caption: best approaching technique that you can

00:09:05.518 --> 00:09:08.518
Caption: take

00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:11.278
Caption: what are the Project funding cycles and

00:09:08.518 --> 00:09:15.539
Caption: how does your team report to them

00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:18.359
Caption: what kind of legal and Regulatory bodies

00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:19.979
Caption: do you sit under there&#39;s so much that

00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:22.559
Caption: you have to consider here

00:09:19.979 --> 00:09:23.940
Caption: there&#39;s another talk about best fit and

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:26.580
Caption: best practice that I think happened

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.838
Caption: earlier today I would love to catch that

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.100
Caption: online and I highly highly recommend

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:30.898
Caption: that you do too if you weren&#39;t able to

00:09:29.099 --> 00:09:33.119
Caption: get to it because there are so many

00:09:30.898 --> 00:09:35.278
Caption: different ways to organize yourselves

00:09:33.119 --> 00:09:36.479
Caption: and execute work and someone might

00:09:35.278 --> 00:09:38.838
Caption: organize themselves in a different way

00:09:36.479 --> 00:09:38.838
Caption: to you

00:09:39.119 --> 00:09:42.479
Caption: I am talking about both the

00:09:40.979 --> 00:09:45.359
Caption: opportunities when you&#39;re trying to

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:46.199
Caption: introduce a new step in the process or

00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:47.398
Caption: when you&#39;re actually trying to take

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.440
Caption: something out

00:09:47.398 --> 00:09:51.000
Caption: I can&#39;t count the number of times that

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.338
Caption: someone&#39;s come to me with an idea to

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.260
Caption: potentially or to my team let&#39;s organize

00:09:53.338 --> 00:09:57.000
Caption: the backlog a little bit differently

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.979
Caption: or let&#39;s add a little bit more structure

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.679
Caption: to Sprint planning and it&#39;s always been

00:09:58.979 --> 00:10:02.880
Caption: met with resistance to change and that&#39;s

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:05.278
Caption: the key thing about this particular

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.320
Caption: topic as humans we aren&#39;t naturally

00:10:05.278 --> 00:10:09.539
Caption: resistant to change there&#39;s a lot of

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.580
Caption: fear there&#39;s a lot of not being able to

00:10:09.539 --> 00:10:12.958
Caption: learn something from scratch or not

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.100
Caption: performing well enough while you are

00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958
Caption: learning

00:10:14.099 --> 00:10:18.119
Caption: but in this particular instance as well

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.559
Caption: there could be some level of insecurity

00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:21.778
Caption: about you know why isn&#39;t the way that

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:23.580
Caption: we&#39;ve been working good enough

00:10:21.778 --> 00:10:27.018
Caption: what&#39;s wrong with it we&#39;ve gotten here

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.019
Caption: so um all this way so far

00:10:27.299 --> 00:10:32.880
Caption: change only happens when the pain of

00:10:30.359 --> 00:10:34.739
Caption: staying the same is greater than the

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.539
Caption: pain of change

00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:38.700
Caption: and the best thing to do in this

00:10:36.539 --> 00:10:42.359
Caption: scenario is to do something with and

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:44.040
Caption: through someone rather than to them

00:10:42.359 --> 00:10:46.679
Caption: bring your folks together and actually

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:48.419
Caption: have that Frank discussion about

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:49.919
Caption: what are the gaps that you&#39;re seeing

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:51.200
Caption: what are the blockers and the

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:53.518
Caption: bottlenecks that you want to address

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.619
Caption: chances are others are potentially

00:10:53.518 --> 00:10:57.599
Caption: feeling it too but maybe they&#39;re too

00:10:55.619 --> 00:10:59.700
Caption: nervous to speak up or maybe they&#39;re too

00:10:57.599 --> 00:11:02.838
Caption: focused on the doing to be able to pause

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.838
Caption: and reflect on how they&#39;re doing

00:11:04.018 --> 00:11:08.039
Caption: when you have people collaborating

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.440
Caption: together on the solution it actually

00:11:08.039 --> 00:11:11.940
Caption: you&#39;re actually empowering people to

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:15.739
Caption: have ownership of the changes that

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.739
Caption: you&#39;re trying to get them to adapt to

00:11:15.778 --> 00:11:20.578
Caption: ask the question though is this actually

00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:21.778
Caption: going to help or hinder us this extra

00:11:20.578 --> 00:11:23.518
Caption: step that we&#39;re going to put in before

00:11:21.778 --> 00:11:25.679
Caption: we make a decision is that going to lead

00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:28.260
Caption: to better decisions are there other ways

00:11:25.679 --> 00:11:30.239
Caption: that we can get the same outcome even if

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.479
Caption: it&#39;s not from a Playbook or a scrum

00:11:30.239 --> 00:11:32.479
Caption: guide

00:11:33.599 --> 00:11:38.239
Caption: the main thing to remember though is to

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.239
Caption: experiment

00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:44.458
Caption: give people a refund policy give them a

00:11:41.099 --> 00:11:45.419
Caption: bit of a way out basically

00:11:44.458 --> 00:11:47.700
Caption: um

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:49.679
Caption: test the waters give something a red hot

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.838
Caption: go before coming together as a team to

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:54.000
Caption: evaluate is this actually working for us

00:11:51.838 --> 00:11:55.799
Caption: maybe it&#39;s uncovered something else that

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.018
Caption: we&#39;d rather focus on

00:11:55.799 --> 00:12:00.719
Caption: building a culture of experimentation

00:11:58.018 --> 00:12:03.539
Caption: into your team early on makes it so much

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:05.879
Caption: easier for you to add incremental change

00:12:03.539 --> 00:12:07.559
Caption: into your into the way that your team

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.940
Caption: Works more often because people are

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:10.619
Caption: going to be comfortable and familiar

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.838
Caption: that change is only going to stick when

00:12:10.619 --> 00:12:16.200
Caption: it&#39;s actually working for you but

00:12:12.838 --> 00:12:17.880
Caption: experimentation also also allows you and

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.480
Caption: your team to scale as your product

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.479
Caption: matures

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.739
Caption: oh

00:12:24.898 --> 00:12:27.898
Caption: we don&#39;t get anything done we didn&#39;t

00:12:26.458 --> 00:12:29.700
Caption: finish our Sprints because you know they

00:12:27.898 --> 00:12:31.919
Caption: just kept changing their minds we can&#39;t

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.559
Caption: seem to get anything right here

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:35.820
Caption: yeah

00:12:33.559 --> 00:12:37.440
Caption: if you&#39;re hearing this let&#39;s talk about

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.600
Caption: it

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.338
Caption: scope creep changing requirements

00:12:39.599 --> 00:12:43.138
Caption: acrobatic backflipping clients it&#39;s a

00:12:41.338 --> 00:12:45.719
Caption: circus out there

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:47.159
Caption: the agile Manifesto was essentially born

00:12:45.719 --> 00:12:48.778
Caption: out of many of the challenges that we&#39;ve

00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:50.940
Caption: discussed today

00:12:48.778 --> 00:12:52.679
Caption: but this is my favorite way of

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.380
Caption: explaining why socializing your product

00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:57.239
Caption: early and often is the best way to avoid

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.979
Caption: surprises

00:12:57.239 --> 00:13:00.539
Caption: you&#39;ve probably experienced this where

00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:02.338
Caption: your ba or your product owner or your

00:13:00.539 --> 00:13:04.259
Caption: customer themselves have spoken to you

00:13:02.338 --> 00:13:06.179
Caption: about this is what we want build it

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.139
Caption: we&#39;ve gone and done the thing showed it

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:09.479
Caption: to them

00:13:07.138 --> 00:13:11.398
Caption: nah

00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:12.659
Caption: the thing about changing requirements is

00:13:11.398 --> 00:13:14.518
Caption: though or changing your mind like

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:16.379
Caption: everything in moderation like I said

00:13:14.518 --> 00:13:18.239
Caption: before we don&#39;t have a crystal ball and

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:21.380
Caption: we don&#39;t expect everyone&#39;s going to get

00:13:18.239 --> 00:13:21.380
Caption: everything right the first time

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:27.838
Caption: this is why feedback loops are so

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.359
Caption: important early and often to make sure

00:13:27.838 --> 00:13:32.338
Caption: that you&#39;ll be able to catch this

00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:34.260
Caption: sooner rather than later and be able to

00:13:32.338 --> 00:13:37.278
Caption: have that conversation and go on the

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.278
Caption: journey with your client

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:42.778
Caption: we want to create Sustainable Solutions

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.739
Caption: and happy customers and regular feedback

00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:45.739
Caption: is the best way to do that

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.018
Caption: there&#39;s no sound but that&#39;s the caption

00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:55.799
Caption: at the end of the day

00:13:53.638 --> 00:13:58.018
Caption: you can spend all the time in the world

00:13:55.799 --> 00:13:59.700
Caption: understanding your customer spending

00:13:58.018 --> 00:14:02.398
Caption: time with them showcasing your product

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.260
Caption: regularly and early

00:14:02.398 --> 00:14:06.059
Caption: you can understand their preferences and

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.220
Caption: their style and still they might keep

00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:10.078
Caption: changing their minds there could be a

00:14:08.219 --> 00:14:11.939
Caption: few underlying reasons for this that

00:14:10.078 --> 00:14:14.099
Caption: they might not be upfront about with you

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.479
Caption: maybe there&#39;s some funding issues that

00:14:14.099 --> 00:14:16.380
Caption: they&#39;re not at Liberty to discuss with

00:14:15.479 --> 00:14:17.880
Caption: you

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.440
Caption: or maybe they&#39;re just not the right

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.479
Caption: people to actually make a decision at

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.039
Caption: the end of it

00:14:21.479 --> 00:14:24.479
Caption: there&#39;s still a few things if you feel

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:28.099
Caption: like you have the ability to influence

00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:28.099
Caption: that you can still do here

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:34.440
Caption: help them build empathy for what it

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.880
Caption: costs you to deal with their change of

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.278
Caption: mind

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.198
Caption: set your boundaries firmly but gently

00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:42.059
Caption: but explain why

00:14:40.198 --> 00:14:43.500
Caption: bring them on the journey with you and

00:14:42.059 --> 00:14:46.979
Caption: don&#39;t assume

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:49.320
Caption: that they know what it costs you

00:14:46.979 --> 00:14:51.179
Caption: there&#39;s uh one of my favorite things to

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.220
Caption: do is the power of contrast

00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:54.599
Caption: I love presenting one good option that I

00:14:53.219 --> 00:14:56.759
Caption: want them to choose and then another

00:14:54.599 --> 00:14:58.518
Caption: option that&#39;s technically feasible but

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.679
Caption: otherwise potentially not quite suitable

00:14:58.518 --> 00:15:03.000
Caption: it&#39;s much easier to be able to see and

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:05.219
Caption: poke holes in something when you can

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.679
Caption: actually see it

00:15:05.219 --> 00:15:09.719
Caption: presenting multiple options is also a

00:15:07.679 --> 00:15:12.359
Caption: fantastic way to

00:15:09.719 --> 00:15:14.338
Caption: demonstrate the evolution of a product

00:15:12.359 --> 00:15:16.679
Caption: vision and the ideas that all of you

00:15:14.338 --> 00:15:18.539
Caption: have had whether it be from a user&#39;s

00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:21.059
Caption: point of view or from a technical

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:23.099
Caption: feasibility point of view

00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:24.778
Caption: I&#39;ve definitely been in scenarios when

00:15:23.099 --> 00:15:26.039
Caption: we&#39;ve been on a bit of a journey on what

00:15:24.778 --> 00:15:28.619
Caption: that product should be doing and we&#39;ve

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:30.239
Caption: got customers who tend to sort of revert

00:15:28.619 --> 00:15:32.039
Caption: to thinking that they had maybe three

00:15:30.239 --> 00:15:33.299
Caption: months ago six months ago why can&#39;t we

00:15:32.039 --> 00:15:35.219
Caption: do it that way again I can&#39;t remember

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:36.239
Caption: everyone&#39;s got a lot going on there&#39;s

00:15:35.219 --> 00:15:39.179
Caption: probably lots of projects that they&#39;re

00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:40.559
Caption: all spread across out on but presenting

00:15:39.179 --> 00:15:43.859
Caption: multiple options and being able to see

00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:45.419
Caption: that contrast can vividly show and

00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:47.458
Caption: demonstrate the difference between where

00:15:45.419 --> 00:15:49.679
Caption: we are now where we started from and

00:15:47.458 --> 00:15:52.320
Caption: clearly explaining why what is the

00:15:49.679 --> 00:15:54.179
Caption: evolution of our thought process here

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.720
Caption: don&#39;t forget to reinforce any further

00:15:54.179 --> 00:16:00.359
Caption: benefits of the current state of what

00:15:57.719 --> 00:16:02.039
Caption: you&#39;ve built and let them know about

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:03.838
Caption: ongoing support and feedback

00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:05.698
Caption: opportunities as well

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:08.659
Caption: anything you can do to ease a little bit

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:08.659
Caption: of a fear of commitment

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.639
Caption: easier said than done for most

00:16:12.778 --> 00:16:17.039
Caption: but if you don&#39;t respect your own time

00:16:14.638 --> 00:16:19.278
Caption: and your own sanity other people won&#39;t

00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:19.278
Caption: either

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.539
Caption: finally

00:16:23.278 --> 00:16:26.539
Caption: it&#39;s retro time

00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:32.039
Caption: you&#39;re talking about what you want to

00:16:28.919 --> 00:16:34.919
Caption: keep doing stop doing start doing

00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:36.179
Caption: and your team are all voting on how well

00:16:34.919 --> 00:16:37.859
Caption: this Sprint went

00:16:36.179 --> 00:16:38.880
Caption: you&#39;re getting fours and fives out of

00:16:37.859 --> 00:16:40.619
Caption: five

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.119
Caption: but maybe you didn&#39;t actually finish

00:16:40.619 --> 00:16:44.299
Caption: your stories

00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:46.739
Caption: maybe some blockers weren&#39;t escalated

00:16:44.299 --> 00:16:48.659
Caption: and dependencies on other teams were

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:50.278
Caption: left really really late

00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:52.500
Caption: now I am specifically talking about

00:16:50.278 --> 00:16:54.898
Caption: those Sprints where

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:57.179
Caption: things weren&#39;t in Tip-Top shape but your

00:16:54.898 --> 00:17:00.898
Caption: team are quite close-knit

00:16:57.179 --> 00:17:02.638
Caption: and feeling a bit self-congratulatory or

00:17:00.898 --> 00:17:04.438
Caption: maybe they&#39;re ignoring the elephants in

00:17:02.638 --> 00:17:06.298
Caption: the room or maybe they&#39;re actually

00:17:04.438 --> 00:17:07.859
Caption: voting more on how each of you as

00:17:06.298 --> 00:17:09.599
Caption: individuals dealt with the challenges

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:11.479
Caption: that your team faced rather than how the

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:14.219
Caption: Sprint actually went

00:17:11.479 --> 00:17:16.558
Caption: retrospectives are an opportunity to

00:17:14.219 --> 00:17:18.178
Caption: come together as a team and evaluate how

00:17:16.558 --> 00:17:19.140
Caption: people process and tools are coming

00:17:18.178 --> 00:17:21.479
Caption: together

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:23.099
Caption: to help you and your team deliver it&#39;s

00:17:21.479 --> 00:17:24.958
Caption: not about airing daily laundry and we&#39;re

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:26.698
Caption: not asking for people to come out and

00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:28.020
Caption: point fingers and start fights or

00:17:26.698 --> 00:17:30.660
Caption: anything like that

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.880
Caption: it is about balance and

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.979
Caption: if you have a team that seems to be

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.558
Caption: unwilling to speak about the real issues

00:17:34.979 --> 00:17:38.640
Caption: that are impacting delivery it could be

00:17:37.558 --> 00:17:40.798
Caption: a sign that they&#39;re lacking

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.780
Caption: psychological safety

00:17:40.798 --> 00:17:45.058
Caption: you don&#39;t need hardly Business Review to

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:47.580
Caption: tell you that psychological safety is

00:17:45.058 --> 00:17:50.038
Caption: the Cornerstone of high performing and

00:17:47.579 --> 00:17:52.558
Caption: multi-disciplinary teams teams I&#39;m sure

00:17:50.038 --> 00:17:55.259
Caption: each of us working day in Day Out

00:17:52.558 --> 00:17:58.319
Caption: but it&#39;s also means that cognitive

00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:00.780
Caption: diversity diversity of thought is better

00:17:58.319 --> 00:18:02.519
Caption: leveraged when people are comfortable

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:05.539
Caption: with each other and familiar with

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.539
Caption: alternative points of view

00:18:07.798 --> 00:18:12.298
Caption: building psychological safety in your

00:18:09.599 --> 00:18:15.119
Caption: team is hard work it takes time and

00:18:12.298 --> 00:18:17.038
Caption: energy but it is well worth it

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:19.439
Caption: you can start by encouraging your team

00:18:17.038 --> 00:18:21.779
Caption: to understand themselves assess

00:18:19.439 --> 00:18:24.058
Caption: themselves think about how they like to

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:27.000
Caption: think work and behave

00:18:24.058 --> 00:18:28.619
Caption: doing this helps you uncover any

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.418
Caption: cognitive biases that you might have

00:18:28.619 --> 00:18:32.099
Caption: that could potentially be contributing

00:18:30.418 --> 00:18:35.099
Caption: to the problem or the culture that you

00:18:32.099 --> 00:18:37.678
Caption: might have that you&#39;re trying to tackle

00:18:35.099 --> 00:18:40.099
Caption: understanding how you like to respond to

00:18:37.678 --> 00:18:43.558
Caption: change or how you respond to conflict

00:18:40.099 --> 00:18:45.239
Caption: can almost give you a moment to

00:18:43.558 --> 00:18:48.500
Caption: basically decide how you&#39;re going to

00:18:45.239 --> 00:18:48.500
Caption: respond to some stimulus

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.619
Caption: but simple things like taking an

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.479
Caption: interest in people&#39;s lives and actively

00:18:52.619 --> 00:18:56.099
Caption: soliciting questions from them giving

00:18:54.479 --> 00:18:57.900
Caption: them multiple channels to give feedback

00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:59.880
Caption: and to communicate depending on their

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.559
Caption: personality types these are things that

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.260
Caption: you can do no matter your position on

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:07.199
Caption: the team formal leadership or not

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.520
Caption: and if you do have a Culture of Fear

00:19:07.199 --> 00:19:10.558
Caption: that&#39;s stopping people from sharing

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.239
Caption: ideas the moments that somebody actually

00:19:10.558 --> 00:19:13.798
Caption: does

00:19:12.239 --> 00:19:16.339
Caption: you need to be ready with the positive

00:19:13.798 --> 00:19:16.339
Caption: response

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.839
Caption: if you are in a formal leadership team

00:19:19.079 --> 00:19:23.939
Caption: you have it is critical though that you

00:19:21.839 --> 00:19:25.918
Caption: are clear and precise with your

00:19:23.939 --> 00:19:28.379
Caption: expectations because this is how you

00:19:25.918 --> 00:19:29.699
Caption: build trust and build reliability within

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:33.178
Caption: your team

00:19:29.699 --> 00:19:35.399
Caption: if you make mistakes own up to them if

00:19:33.178 --> 00:19:39.659
Caption: there are changes explain them

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:41.580
Caption: be more human be divine be vulnerable

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.679
Caption: cannot underestimate the influence that

00:19:41.579 --> 00:19:46.019
Caption: you have on Team Dynamics no matter your

00:19:43.678 --> 00:19:47.699
Caption: position on the team culture is top down

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.919
Caption: but

00:19:47.699 --> 00:19:51.918
Caption: the individual behaviors basically

00:19:49.918 --> 00:19:55.199
Caption: explain to ourselves and to each other

00:19:51.918 --> 00:19:57.779
Caption: what what we&#39;re willing to accept from

00:19:55.199 --> 00:19:59.418
Caption: our colleagues and from ourselves

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.640
Caption: and people are always responsible

00:19:59.418 --> 00:20:05.239
Caption: responsive to purposeful and courageous

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.239
Caption: vulnerability

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.199
Caption: at the end of the day retrospectives are

00:20:08.099 --> 00:20:13.020
Caption: about getting a team that&#39;s so focused

00:20:10.199 --> 00:20:14.519
Caption: on the next big thing the next Sprint to

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.020
Caption: actually pause and reflect on what&#39;s

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.580
Caption: just been

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.739
Caption: they&#39;re a great way to introduce

00:20:17.579 --> 00:20:21.779
Caption: incremental change but sometimes complex

00:20:19.739 --> 00:20:24.719
Caption: problems can come up as well

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:27.239
Caption: complex problems are often the sign of a

00:20:24.719 --> 00:20:28.558
Caption: team that has uh that&#39;s letting

00:20:27.239 --> 00:20:30.178
Caption: something Fester because they don&#39;t feel

00:20:28.558 --> 00:20:33.439
Caption: comfortable talking about it until it

00:20:30.178 --> 00:20:33.439
Caption: eventually it explodes

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:39.298
Caption: every single framework to organize

00:20:36.178 --> 00:20:42.000

Caption: free market a donor economy that is

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.459
Caption: until

00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:46.459
Caption: people get involved

00:20:48.538 --> 00:20:53.038
Caption: the things that make us different

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.080
Caption: make things so complicated

00:20:53.038 --> 00:20:57.058
Caption: but the things that make us different

00:20:55.079 --> 00:20:59.219
Caption: can make us even stronger if it&#39;s

00:20:57.058 --> 00:21:01.439
Caption: harnessed appropriately

00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:04.319
Caption: each of us are a product of our

00:21:01.439 --> 00:21:06.719
Caption: experiences we&#39;ve all experienced life

00:21:04.319 --> 00:21:08.459
Caption: and work so differently and we bring

00:21:06.719 --> 00:21:10.380
Caption: that into every single interaction that

00:21:08.459 --> 00:21:12.719
Caption: we ever have

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.940
Caption: the way we respond to change the way we

00:21:12.719 --> 00:21:16.558
Caption: set boundaries or don&#39;t the way we

00:21:14.939 --> 00:21:18.719
Caption: respond to conflict

00:21:16.558 --> 00:21:20.159
Caption: each of these can be a challenge turned

00:21:18.719 --> 00:21:22.678
Caption: into an opportunity

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.020
Caption: if we just take a little bit of time out

00:21:22.678 --> 00:21:26.640
Caption: of our days to pause and reflect on

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.640
Caption: what&#39;s just been

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:32.039
Caption: who we are now and where we want to go

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.299
Caption: and if we do this together as a team we

00:21:32.038 --> 00:21:35.298
Caption: can make sure that our teams are humming
