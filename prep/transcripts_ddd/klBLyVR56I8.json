  "description": "Brain tumours are currently the number one cause of cancer related death in children worldwide. The current method of identifying childhood brain tumours is problematic at best and useless at worse for remote and budget limiting healthcare locations. But perhaps machine learning holds the key to speed and cost allowing isolated areas like Perth to diagnosis these deadly diseases locally. I will be discussing how we have addressed this problem both from machine learning software development perspective and deployment approach."
