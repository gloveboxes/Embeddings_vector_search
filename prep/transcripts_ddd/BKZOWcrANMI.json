  "description": "Launching sideways from Animation into the rapidly expanding Tech Cosmos has been the best adventure of my life. I\u2019ve found my people, my niche and I\u2019ve never felt more connected.\\n\\nBut looking all around, this little rocket ship is not yet convinced it will be an entirely smooth-sailing journey...\\n\\nWhether you\u2019re a Femme, Fabio or Face-Hugger brace yourself for a light-speed journey through the ins and outs of deciding to become a \u0027Woman in Tech\u0027.\\n\\nIncluding learning to:\\n- Burn the right Brain Fuel\\n- Dodge the \u2018Black Hole of Burnout\u2019\\n- Identify Aliens and Imposters\\n- Build a strong Ship Maintenance Crew\\n- And convince the Mother Ship to keep course\u2026 no matter what it takes.\\n\\nI don\u2019t have all the answers for creating a toolkit to increase diversity in tech. But I sure do have a damn good metaphor, decision-making trees, risk-calculating kittens, and plenty of space cake.\\n\\nSo, sit back, relax and discover why I choose to #BeHer, even if I can\u2019t always #SeeHer.\\n\\nBringing creativity, design skills and infectious enthusiasm to local tech, social impact and education spaces around WA.\\n\\n#womenintech #girlswhocode"
