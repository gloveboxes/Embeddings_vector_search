00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:08.220
Caption: just all of a sudden got very quiet

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.000
Caption: welcome back everybody we are on to our

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.340
Caption: last session for today which is our lock

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.278
Caption: note so very shortly I&#39;m going to hand

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.438
Caption: over to Chris ferry so Chris has a PHD

00:00:19.278 --> 00:00:26.159
Caption: and does a lot of work in the science

00:00:22.438 --> 00:00:27.598
Caption: field however he also writes children&#39;s

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:30.180
Caption: books

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.260
Caption: now I had an opportunity to see Chris

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.340
Caption: speak at DDD Brisbane a similar event on

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:37.439
Caption: the other side of the country a few

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.099
Caption: years ago and

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:42.599
Caption: I was actually super impressed with the

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:44.819
Caption: books and thought it was really amazing

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:46.319
Caption: I got one of the books on blockchain so

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:49.459
Caption: now I know everything about blockchain

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:49.459
Caption: from blockchain for babies

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.739
Caption: and I also want to say a huge thank you

00:00:52.738 --> 00:00:57.599
Caption: to Chris who received an email from me

00:00:55.738 --> 00:00:59.819
Caption: on Wednesday morning

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:01.860
Caption: to see if he could come and give our

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:06.298
Caption: Keynotes this afternoon

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.979
Caption: today so big thank you to Chris for

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.439
Caption: saving us at the last minute when we had

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:12.599
Caption: a few travel difficulties so I&#39;m going

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.780
Caption: to hand over to Chris thank you very

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:14.779
Caption: much

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.619
Caption: [Applause]

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:26.819
Caption: yeah so thanks for the invite thanks for

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.400
Caption: giving me lots of time to consider it uh

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:32.459
Caption: um I was going to be here for the tattoo

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.020
Caption: conference anyway so oh I thought I

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.298
Caption: might as well come by

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:39.000
Caption: yeah so I&#39;m Chris Ferry I&#39;m an associate

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.560
Caption: professor at the center for Quantum

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.180
Caption: software and information at the

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:44.819
Caption: University of Technology Sydney and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.099
Caption: that&#39;s obviously in Sydney and I lead a

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.619
Caption: research group and we do research in

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:53.279
Caption: Quantum machine learning and Quantum

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.500
Caption: control so we do like uh low-level stuff

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:58.199
Caption: with Quantum hardware and high level

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.579
Caption: Kind of Blue Sky Thinking about what

00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:00.360
Caption: we&#39;ll do with quantum computers in the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.619
Caption: future

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.119
Caption: but I thought since I have you all here

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.759
Caption: I&#39;ll just read you a story

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.160
Caption: uh it&#39;s going to be a bit awkward for me

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.720
Caption: to try to do this with the book so I&#39;ll

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.720
Caption: just show you the book on screen

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.919
Caption: I think I&#39;ll do that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.340
Caption: ah here we go okay here we go The Cat In

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.919
Caption: The Box

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:28.199
Caption: it did not sit well it was far too

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:30.899
Caption: confusing so we sat at the Blackboard

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:33.300
Caption: the two of us musing I sat with

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:35.939
Caption: Schrodinger dreaming of quantum theory

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.979
Caption: but the math of it all made both of us

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.020
Caption: dreary

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:42.779
Caption: what was it about

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.900
Caption: we were not content the trouble came

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:48.958
Caption: down to the entanglement and then a

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:50.518
Caption: knock at the door a box but who was it

00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:54.300
Caption: for

00:02:50.518 --> 00:02:57.539
Caption: we looked in and saw a cat in a box we

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.360
Caption: looked in and saw a cat that talks and

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:02.878
Caption: it said to us get me out of this box

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.399
Caption: I was happy to see it an extra mind

00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:07.679
Caption: right now we needed all the help we

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:10.500
Caption: could find

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:13.859
Caption: and then an idea with the cat&#39;s great

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.300
Caption: sight it could see a single Quantum a

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.958
Caption: Quantum of light

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.900
Caption: an excited Adam will Decay a random

00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:24.179
Caption: condition the cat might see a

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:26.878
Caption: superposition

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:30.419
Caption: Schrodinger went on next we closed the

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:34.018
Caption: lid to look in the box is what I forbid

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:36.539
Caption: the cat will see and not see an odd

00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:39.000
Caption: condition the cat will be in

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:41.219
Caption: superposition

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.220
Caption: Schrodinger used this cat in the Box to

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.018
Caption: dream up the first Quantum Paradox a

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.540
Caption: paradox is something that doesn&#39;t make

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:50.158
Caption: sense there must be an assumption that

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:52.378
Caption: is causing offense

00:03:50.158 --> 00:03:55.559
Caption: the theory has failed Schrodinger cried

00:03:52.378 --> 00:03:57.360
Caption: we must start all over and swallow our

00:03:55.559 --> 00:04:00.059
Caption: pride

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.819
Caption: but then I smiled to our own merriment

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:05.458
Caption: we have the cat box and Adam to do the

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.798
Caption: experiment the scientific method is to

00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:12.000
Caption: test hypotheses so our knowledge can

00:04:07.798 --> 00:04:14.279
Caption: grow Beyond just the ABCs

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.320
Caption: through all of this shaking its head the

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:18.660
Caption: cat quietly listened to all that was

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.000
Caption: said a Quantum superposition the cat

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.860
Caption: said with the Sigh a silly idea and I&#39;ll

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.739
Caption: tell you why but I must teach you some

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:29.459
Caption: physics and where it applies

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:31.440
Caption: the lesson began I see your intent but

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:33.779
Caption: the most important thing is the

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.699
Caption: measurement when I look at the atom to

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:38.880
Caption: see if it&#39;s spent I create in the world

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.580
Caption: a Quantum event when measurement acts

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.520
Caption: the atom itself is forced to collapse it

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:48.599
Caption: might stay excited it might Decay but

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:50.698
Caption: which it will be no one can say

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.740
Caption: but all is not lost we are not throwing

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.540
Caption: dice we can calculate some things when

00:04:52.739 --> 00:04:56.699
Caption: science gives us advice

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.300
Caption: though nothing is certain one thing is

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:04.259
Caption: key physics can tell us the probability

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:07.019
Caption: Quantum probability a tricky concept to

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.540
Caption: use it one needs to be quite Adept but

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:11.959
Caption: study the math and before long the

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.300
Caption: quantum tune you&#39;ll be singing along

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:19.259
Caption: algebra calculus and geometry the more

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:20.879
Caption: math you know the happier you&#39;ll be

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.100
Caption: the cat was not done there was more

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.259
Caption: quantum physics such a rich Theory can&#39;t

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.059
Caption: be taught in mere minutes the next

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.979
Caption: lesson I have is where the name comes

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:31.500
Caption: from I&#39;ll tell you why we call it

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.779
Caption: quantum you see said the cat when you

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.639
Caption: measure my size any number at all is due

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:37.979
Caption: to a rise

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.860
Caption: but measure an atom and what will come

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.800
Caption: out a single Quantum of energy will be

00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:46.799
Caption: brought about a photon of light will be

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:51.119
Caption: let go the atom&#39;s energy from high to

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:55.440
Caption: low the photons energy must be exact one

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:57.479
Caption: Quantum of light from the atom subtract

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.519
Caption: so you see now said the Box cat no

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.800
Caption: superposition no doubt about that when I

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:05.519
Caption: measure I break the quantum effect no

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:07.978
Caption: Paradox at all that you should suspect

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:10.019
Caption: I know all of this Schrodinger quickly

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.059
Caption: replied I invented this Theory a fact

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:13.979
Caption: none deny I&#39;m afraid it is you who&#39;s

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:16.739
Caption: missing a fact the best part of the

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:19.259
Caption: theory is due for its Act of course I am

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:22.500
Caption: talking of entanglement the source that

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.660
Caption: is giving me such bafflement

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.000
Caption: the Box will be closed just the atom and

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.000
Caption: you a large Quantum thing Becomes of the

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.699
Caption: two you and the atom entanglement a

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.279
Caption: curious State it&#39;s no accident we&#39;ll

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:37.739
Caption: open the box and ask just one question

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:40.739
Caption: what did it look like the quantum

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:43.559
Caption: connection I wish to resolve this deep

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:45.539
Caption: mystery so future scientists have less

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:48.299
Caption: misery

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:50.459
Caption: the cat disagreed it&#39;s not mysterious

00:06:48.299 --> 00:06:53.099
Caption: you have simply mixed up our experience

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:55.440
Caption: outside the box lies uncertainty but for

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.959
Caption: me in the Box I will know what I see the

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.299
Caption: light from the atom will come or will

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.380
Caption: not and not superpose as you have

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:03.899
Caption: thought

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.940
Caption: but the cat could see without doubt we

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:08.699
Caption: were not letting ready to let it get out

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.160
Caption: so the cat agreed to stay in and wait

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:13.919
Caption: for the atom inside to change its state

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:18.000
Caption: so the child began the Adam and Cat

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:20.940
Caption: Inside the Box it quietly sat

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.039
Caption: we waited too the tension was Rife we

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:26.220
Caption: decided to wait for the Adam&#39;s Half-Life

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:28.679
Caption: that is the time for the Adam&#39;s Decay to

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.660
Caption: reach the point of half what it may the

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:33.119
Caption: point of Half-Life was shown on the

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.940
Caption: clock Schrodinger knew what went on in

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:38.639
Caption: the Box two possibilities at the same

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.440
Caption: time but open the box and only one we

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:42.839
Caption: shall find

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.299
Caption: but what had gone on before the Box

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:48.119
Caption: opened from The Cat In The Box it will

00:07:45.299 --> 00:07:50.519
Caption: be spoken so we opened the box and what

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:53.039
Caption: was in there the cat sitting quietly

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:55.440
Caption: licking its hair

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:57.779
Caption: cat shouted Schrodinger what do you say

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.179
Caption: what did you see do not delay

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:02.039
Caption: it is as I said I saw the photon nothing

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:04.319
Caption: strange at all in the box has gone on

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:07.679
Caption: the atom collapsed a short time ago I

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:10.139
Caption: measured its light as it will now show

00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:12.059
Caption: for science to work repetition is key to

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:15.059
Caption: correct errors we need at least three

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:18.179
Caption: but more is better data is gold so

00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:20.399
Caption: valuable it&#39;s bought and it&#39;s sold

00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:24.359
Caption: so the cat went back in again and again

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:26.878
Caption: the cat was amused and did not complain

00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:29.399
Caption: the results were in and we had to agree

00:08:26.878 --> 00:08:31.979
Caption: there was no Quantum magic for the cat

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:33.658
Caption: to see the light from the atom came or

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:35.820
Caption: did not but never them both as

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:39.239
Caption: Schrodinger thought now we are happy

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:41.580
Caption: with no Paradox thanks to the cat

00:08:39.239 --> 00:08:43.029
Caption: The Cat In The Box

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:49.860
Caption: and

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:52.560
Caption: [Applause]

00:08:49.859 --> 00:08:55.320
Caption: okay so there was lots of words in there

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:57.000
Caption: um they upset Schrodinger I don&#39;t know

00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.778
Caption: if you know who Urban Schrodinger is

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.599
Caption: he&#39;s a German scientist Austrian I can&#39;t

00:09:00.778 --> 00:09:05.338
Caption: remember back then it didn&#39;t matter

00:09:03.599 --> 00:09:06.838
Caption: um

00:09:05.338 --> 00:09:09.479
Caption: uh

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:11.580
Caption: but he this is what he wrote It&#39;s like

00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:13.320
Caption: this obscure paper that he became famous

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.338
Caption: for and this was you know this isn&#39;t

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.859
Caption: exactly what he wrote Because he wrote

00:09:14.338 --> 00:09:19.679
Caption: it in German but this is the translation

00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:21.659
Caption: so we can read that so one can even set

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:23.940
Caption: up quite ridiculous cases a cat is

00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:25.679
Caption: penned up in a steel chamber along with

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.659
Caption: the following device which must be

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:30.958
Caption: secured against direct interference by

00:09:27.659 --> 00:09:33.359
Caption: the cat in a geiger counter that is the

00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:35.398
Caption: thing that tests radioactivity there&#39;s a

00:09:33.359 --> 00:09:37.200
Caption: little bit of radioactive substance so

00:09:35.398 --> 00:09:40.018
Caption: small that perhaps in the course of an

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.080
Caption: hour one of the atoms decays but also

00:09:40.018 --> 00:09:45.239
Caption: with equal probability perhaps none if

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.160
Caption: it happens the counter tube discharges

00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:49.398
Caption: and through a relay releases a hammer

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:52.739
Caption: that shatters a small flask of

00:09:49.398 --> 00:09:54.719
Caption: hydrocyanic acid if one has left this

00:09:52.739 --> 00:09:56.458
Caption: entire system to itself for an hour one

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:58.859
Caption: would say that the cat still lives if

00:09:56.458 --> 00:10:01.200
Caption: meanwhile no atom has decayed

00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:04.440
Caption: but the first atomic Decay would have

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.179
Caption: poisoned it the PSI function which I&#39;ll

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.359
Caption: tell you about in a minute of the entire

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:12.719
Caption: system would Express this by having in

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:15.359
Caption: the living and dead cat mixed or smeared

00:10:12.719 --> 00:10:17.699
Caption: out in equal parts

00:10:15.359 --> 00:10:18.838
Caption: um this is like early 20th century

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.958
Caption: Germany

00:10:18.838 --> 00:10:23.278
Caption: um that&#39;s probably another

00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.000
Caption: uncommon

00:10:23.278 --> 00:10:26.039
Caption: um

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.958
Caption: so I I changed it for the modern times

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:29.338
Caption: so we have this cool cat that doesn&#39;t

00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.359
Caption: die

00:10:29.338 --> 00:10:32.159
Caption: um

00:10:30.359 --> 00:10:34.979
Caption: but that you know that was one paragraph

00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:37.739
Caption: and and that&#39;s one of the most famous

00:10:34.979 --> 00:10:39.958
Caption: things that Schrodinger or the it&#39;s the

00:10:37.739 --> 00:10:41.880
Caption: most yeah it&#39;s what he&#39;s most famous for

00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:45.119
Caption: although

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:48.838
Caption: he did invent the Schrodinger equation

00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:51.059
Caption: which is still the equation that we use

00:10:48.838 --> 00:10:54.778
Caption: in quantum physics to explain the

00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:57.479
Caption: behavior of the microscopic world

00:10:54.778 --> 00:11:00.898
Caption: uh and I&#39;m going to tell you a little

00:10:57.479 --> 00:11:02.338
Caption: bit about that because today you know at

00:11:00.898 --> 00:11:04.619
Caption: this at the center for Quantum software

00:11:02.338 --> 00:11:06.479
Caption: and places all around the world we&#39;re

00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:09.778
Caption: trying to build a new kind of computing

00:11:06.479 --> 00:11:11.338
Caption: technology that&#39;s built from these

00:11:09.778 --> 00:11:12.659
Caption: things that that Schrodinger is talking

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:14.398
Caption: about

00:11:12.659 --> 00:11:16.500
Caption: um and he was really frustrated about

00:11:14.398 --> 00:11:19.278
Caption: quantum theory in fact he left quantum

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:22.799
Caption: theory to become an Irish botanist

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:24.359
Caption: which is also true and he wrote a book

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:27.000
Caption: called what is life and that became very

00:11:24.359 --> 00:11:29.000
Caption: influential to people like Francis Crick

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.760
Caption: who went on to discover

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.200
Caption: DNA after he stole photos from someone

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:39.059
Caption: um

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:41.040
Caption: so you know he&#39;s a an odd an odd

00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:43.018
Caption: character and I think he had he stayed

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:45.179
Caption: in quantum physics he probably would

00:11:43.018 --> 00:11:46.859
Caption: have figured out some of the things that

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:49.018
Caption: I&#39;m going to tell you

00:11:46.859 --> 00:11:51.059
Caption: um in a little bit

00:11:49.018 --> 00:11:52.739
Caption: okay so what&#39;s all this stuff about

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:54.419
Caption: atoms so you&#39;ve probably seen a picture

00:11:52.739 --> 00:11:57.778
Caption: like that maybe you remember it from

00:11:54.419 --> 00:12:00.200
Caption: your high school uh chemistry or science

00:11:57.778 --> 00:12:03.659
Caption: class you have this thing in the middle

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.700
Caption: and and then the electrons go around the

00:12:03.659 --> 00:12:07.919
Caption: outside and the further away they&#39;re

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:12.059
Caption: away from the center the more energy

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:14.039
Caption: they have so the lowest energy state is

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:16.739
Caption: called the ground state and the highest

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:19.078
Caption: energy state is called the excited state

00:12:16.739 --> 00:12:21.778
Caption: okay so there&#39;s two imagine two states

00:12:19.078 --> 00:12:23.278
Caption: ground state excited state

00:12:21.778 --> 00:12:25.380
Caption: if

00:12:23.278 --> 00:12:27.179
Caption: the electron goes from the excited state

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:30.539
Caption: to the ground state we call that decay

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:32.159
Caption: and when that happens energy has to be

00:12:30.539 --> 00:12:34.139
Caption: given off there&#39;s conservation of energy

00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:37.018
Caption: if you have high energy then low energy

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.940
Caption: then that energy has to go somewhere and

00:12:37.018 --> 00:12:41.219
Caption: that energy is always the same amount

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.859
Caption: and that&#39;s where the word Quantum in

00:12:41.219 --> 00:12:46.078
Caption: quantum physics comes from and we

00:12:43.859 --> 00:12:47.458
Caption: usually associate things in quantum

00:12:46.078 --> 00:12:51.119
Caption: physics at the fundamental level with

00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:55.138
Caption: particles and so it&#39;s a photon

00:12:51.119 --> 00:12:57.479
Caption: so energy from the electron gets turned

00:12:55.138 --> 00:12:59.820
Caption: into electromagnetic energy that we can

00:12:57.479 --> 00:13:01.559
Caption: detect and see

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.958
Caption: uh

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:07.260
Caption: we&#39;ll move closer to abstraction we&#39;ll

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:08.039
Caption: get rid of this picture that we draw for

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.720
Caption: um

00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:12.659
Caption: for students

00:13:09.719 --> 00:13:14.398
Caption: and in science we we think of like a

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:18.719
Caption: ladder of energy and you can step up and

00:13:14.398 --> 00:13:20.638
Caption: step down and you need to to to step to

00:13:18.719 --> 00:13:22.919
Caption: drop down you have to give away energy

00:13:20.638 --> 00:13:25.500
Caption: that&#39;s the Decay but you can also have

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:27.679
Caption: the opposite which is absorption and so

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:31.380
Caption: for something to gain energy to step up

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:35.820
Caption: then it has to accept a photon and that

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.599
Caption: amount of energy has to be exact

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.880
Caption: foreign

00:13:36.599 --> 00:13:40.859
Caption: so the picture in the book was like this

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.660
Caption: you know artistic between ground state

00:13:40.859 --> 00:13:45.479
Caption: and excited state

00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:48.419
Caption: um you know in in

00:13:45.479 --> 00:13:51.659
Caption: physics we draw this energy level

00:13:48.419 --> 00:13:54.419
Caption: diagram and

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:56.940
Caption: um since we&#39;re all comfortable with

00:13:54.419 --> 00:13:59.278
Caption: um binary numbers here let&#39;s label them

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.559
Caption: one and zero so you can see now that

00:13:59.278 --> 00:14:04.320
Caption: this atom can encode a bit of

00:14:01.559 --> 00:14:07.200
Caption: information in its energy levels

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.600
Caption: and it can do more than that

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.518
Caption: and how the the secret to quantum

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:13.559
Caption: physics is to do this

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:15.958
Caption: you put little symbols around it

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:18.000
Caption: and now it becomes what children are

00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:20.338
Caption: called a PSI function

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.018
Caption: and I&#39;ll I&#39;ll tell you why we do that in

00:14:20.338 --> 00:14:26.099
Caption: a second

00:14:22.018 --> 00:14:28.200
Caption: okay so in the book If the atom is

00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:29.578
Caption: excited then it hasn&#39;t give it hasn&#39;t

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.700
Caption: decayed and it hasn&#39;t given off this

00:14:29.578 --> 00:14:36.059
Caption: Photon so the cat can&#39;t see anything

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:40.199
Caption: uh if it decayed then the cat sees the

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:43.799
Caption: photon that was given off and the uh the

00:14:40.198 --> 00:14:47.039
Caption: electron is in the Lower State

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:48.299
Caption: but what about in the middle

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:50.398
Caption: hmm

00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:52.679
Caption: that&#39;s interesting can we do that sure

00:14:50.398 --> 00:14:54.119
Caption: why not it&#39;s quantum physics and we say

00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:57.778
Caption: that

00:14:54.119 --> 00:15:01.760
Caption: it&#39;s in a superposition so it&#39;s in both

00:14:57.778 --> 00:15:01.760
Caption: zero and one at the same time

00:15:02.578 --> 00:15:07.138
Caption: and

00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:10.380
Caption: that&#39;s the sort of secret to quantum

00:15:07.138 --> 00:15:13.018
Caption: physics so it&#39;s even though I&#39;ve labeled

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:15.239
Caption: it zero and one it it doesn&#39;t encode a

00:15:13.018 --> 00:15:18.119
Caption: bit of information anymore

00:15:15.239 --> 00:15:20.940
Caption: um technically it&#39;s a new mathematical

00:15:18.119 --> 00:15:22.440
Caption: object it&#39;s a vector and if you know

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.838
Caption: anything about vectors then you can add

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:27.838
Caption: them together so

00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:30.119
Caption: in addition to zero and one I can have

00:15:27.838 --> 00:15:34.500
Caption: any sort of a combination of zero and

00:15:30.119 --> 00:15:36.059
Caption: one as well so this is a new kind of

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.638
Caption: information

00:15:36.059 --> 00:15:42.479
Caption: that is much richer than our

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:45.239
Caption: conventional notion of bits

00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:48.119
Caption: the rule is that

00:15:45.239 --> 00:15:50.578
Caption: either when you try to when you try to

00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:52.820
Caption: go and look at this information you&#39;ll

00:15:50.578 --> 00:15:57.898
Caption: see the Lower State

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:59.518
Caption: or the higher state and what happens is

00:15:57.898 --> 00:16:01.380
Caption: determined by the rules of probability

00:15:59.518 --> 00:16:04.380
Caption: in quantum mechanics

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.119
Caption: okay but you never get to see

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.599
Caption: superpositions

00:16:06.119 --> 00:16:13.500
Caption: so that&#39;s the sort of trick

00:16:08.599 --> 00:16:15.179
Caption: so uh Quantum information is richer in

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.979
Caption: some sense but it&#39;s limiting in another

00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:19.979
Caption: sense and trying to find the balance

00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:24.000
Caption: between those uh is is part of the the

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:25.518
Caption: trick of the quantum programmer

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.799
Caption: so

00:16:25.518 --> 00:16:29.820
Caption: the the other thing that was mentioned

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:33.659
Caption: in the book

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.919
Caption: was these correlations so

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:38.458
Caption: I have

00:16:34.919 --> 00:16:39.958
Caption: the atom being in its Lower State and

00:16:38.458 --> 00:16:41.880
Caption: the cat seeing

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:43.799
Caption: and I have the atom staying in this

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.599
Caption: excited state and the cat not seeing so

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:47.638
Caption: those two events are correlated

00:16:45.599 --> 00:16:49.859
Caption: and those correlated events can be put

00:16:47.638 --> 00:16:51.778
Caption: in superposition as well why not they&#39;re

00:16:49.859 --> 00:16:52.859
Caption: vectors let&#39;s just add them together and

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:55.138
Caption: that&#39;s what&#39;s called quantum

00:16:52.859 --> 00:16:58.559
Caption: entanglement it&#39;s a coral it&#39;s a

00:16:55.138 --> 00:17:01.078
Caption: superposition of these correlations

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:02.638
Caption: uh so Schrodinger he was sitting outside

00:17:01.078 --> 00:17:04.438
Caption: the box and that&#39;s what he had in his

00:17:02.638 --> 00:17:06.838
Caption: mind okay according to Quantum Mechanics

00:17:04.438 --> 00:17:08.760
Caption: these things are correlated and I have

00:17:06.838 --> 00:17:11.219
Caption: to describe them in this way

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.900
Caption: but I only ever see this

00:17:11.219 --> 00:17:15.119
Caption: or this

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.859
Caption: so what does that other thing mean right

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:19.798
Caption: what what are these what are these

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:24.678
Caption: things inside this angle bracket and

00:17:19.798 --> 00:17:24.678
Caption: straight bracket uh back at me

00:17:24.719 --> 00:17:29.159
Caption: um

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:33.000
Caption: basically his his question was what is

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:34.739
Caption: this PSI function so yeah when we when

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.140
Caption: we write out arbitrary

00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:40.380
Caption: states of quantum information we usually

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.760
Caption: use Greek letters and we start with PSI

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.739
Caption: and then we run through them all until

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.359
Caption: we run out and then we start putting

00:17:43.739 --> 00:17:46.319
Caption: subscripts and superscripts and all

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:49.558
Caption: sorts of

00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:51.298
Caption: stuff that scares people away

00:17:49.558 --> 00:17:52.319
Caption: probably on purpose

00:17:51.298 --> 00:17:54.359
Caption: okay

00:17:52.319 --> 00:17:57.659
Caption: so the answer to the question there&#39;s

00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:59.339
Caption: two answers to the question one is this

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.400
Caption: object

00:17:59.339 --> 00:18:04.500
Caption: is in one-to-one correspondence with

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.140
Caption: what&#39;s really happening it&#39;s what

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.959
Caption: describes reality that&#39;s one way to look

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:11.539
Caption: at it if you follow that path it&#39;ll lead

00:18:09.959 --> 00:18:14.219
Caption: you towards like

00:18:11.538 --> 00:18:16.259
Caption: parallel universes many worlds the

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:16.798
Caption: Multiverse

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.859
Caption: um

00:18:16.798 --> 00:18:23.038
Caption: Marvel movies that sort of thing

00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:24.479
Caption: um a lot of philosophers and physicists

00:18:23.038 --> 00:18:25.199
Caption: like this

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:28.319
Caption: um

00:18:25.199 --> 00:18:31.500
Caption: but in the 90s well maybe like in the

00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:34.019
Caption: 80s people started to think about this

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.780
Caption: what if this object is really just

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.919
Caption: information and if we think about it in

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.799
Caption: that way

00:18:37.918 --> 00:18:42.199
Caption: then we have this we&#39;re not constrained

00:18:40.798 --> 00:18:45.418
Caption: by

00:18:42.199 --> 00:18:48.298
Caption: our physical intuition that that we

00:18:45.418 --> 00:18:51.779
Caption: require when we practice physics

00:18:48.298 --> 00:18:54.839
Caption: and so in the in the 80s people started

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.280
Caption: to think about what we could do with

00:18:54.839 --> 00:18:59.219
Caption: this information

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.619
Caption: it seems to be richer than

00:18:59.219 --> 00:19:02.400
Caption: bits

00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:03.900
Caption: um

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.960
Caption: could we

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:09.239
Caption: could we just simulate it so I saw a

00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:12.319
Caption: talk just just earlier today where

00:19:09.239 --> 00:19:16.319
Caption: someone mentioned a turing machine

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:18.719
Caption: so there&#39;s the famous Church Turing

00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:21.538
Caption: thesis that basically the physical

00:19:18.719 --> 00:19:23.159
Caption: version is a touring computer can

00:19:21.538 --> 00:19:25.619
Caption: efficiently simulate any physical

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.539
Caption: process in the universe

00:19:25.619 --> 00:19:28.798
Caption: but that doesn&#39;t seem to be true of

00:19:27.538 --> 00:19:32.699
Caption: quantum physics

00:19:28.798 --> 00:19:35.399
Caption: so in the 80s they invented the

00:19:32.699 --> 00:19:37.798
Caption: notion of a Quantum touring machine and

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.780
Caption: there&#39;s a new thesis the quantum Church

00:19:37.798 --> 00:19:43.079
Caption: during thesis by the way

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.640
Caption: um if you&#39;re ever get into quantum

00:19:43.079 --> 00:19:46.439
Caption: physics it&#39;s just an exercise in putting

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.820
Caption: the word Quantum in front of everything

00:19:46.439 --> 00:19:48.899
Caption: that everyone else has already worked

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:50.779
Caption: out

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.339
Caption: um

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.020
Caption: the quantum Church Turing thesis says

00:19:53.339 --> 00:19:57.058
Caption: that a universal quantum computer could

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.219
Caption: efficiently simulate every any physical

00:19:57.058 --> 00:20:00.719
Caption: process in the universe and we don&#39;t

00:19:59.219 --> 00:20:04.020
Caption: know we don&#39;t have an answer to that

00:20:00.719 --> 00:20:05.939
Caption: question of if there&#39;s a gap is a

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:08.900
Caption: quantum computer actually more powerful

00:20:05.939 --> 00:20:11.159
Caption: than a classical computer

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.960
Caption: you&#39;ll win a million dollars if you can

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.320
Caption: answer that question it&#39;s related to the

00:20:12.959 --> 00:20:17.819
Caption: famous P versus MP complete question

00:20:16.319 --> 00:20:19.918
Caption: um but you probably win a lot more stuff

00:20:17.819 --> 00:20:22.500
Caption: if you figure that out so we don&#39;t know

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:25.619
Caption: but we highly suspect that a quantum

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.298
Caption: computer is in some sense more powerful

00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:28.558
Caption: than a classical computer

00:20:27.298 --> 00:20:32.099
Caption: and

00:20:28.558 --> 00:20:33.538
Caption: in 1995 a guy named Peter Shore figured

00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:35.160
Caption: out that if you could build a quantum

00:20:33.538 --> 00:20:38.038
Caption: computer there&#39;s an algorithm you can

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.419
Caption: run on it called Shores algorithm now

00:20:38.038 --> 00:20:41.579
Caption: um I don&#39;t think he called it Shores

00:20:39.418 --> 00:20:42.839
Caption: algorithm but people after him called it

00:20:41.579 --> 00:20:43.380
Caption: shorts alcohol

00:20:42.839 --> 00:20:45.659
Caption: um

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:49.140
Caption: that would crack RSA

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:50.880
Caption: and so 1995 was really the cusp when

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:53.339
Caption: people started to get interested in this

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.660
Caption: because there was money and people tend

00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:58.739
Caption: to follow money

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:59.820
Caption: and we didn&#39;t have any any device at the

00:20:58.739 --> 00:21:04.020
Caption: time

00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:05.819
Caption: now we have many commercial available

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:08.039
Caption: quantum computers

00:21:05.819 --> 00:21:10.619
Caption: so at the University of Perth I think

00:21:08.038 --> 00:21:11.579
Caption: the only commercially available quantum

00:21:10.619 --> 00:21:13.500
Caption: computer

00:21:11.579 --> 00:21:16.558
Caption: uh in Australia

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:19.619
Caption: it runs on two Quantum bits called

00:21:16.558 --> 00:21:21.719
Caption: qubits so not very impressive and the

00:21:19.619 --> 00:21:26.160
Caption: largest device

00:21:21.719 --> 00:21:27.538
Caption: um is around 150 Quantum bits also

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.400
Caption: called qubits

00:21:27.538 --> 00:21:31.019
Caption: and you can access that for free over

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.460
Caption: the cloud

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.700
Caption: or you can pay

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:38.520
Caption: and those devices have been sold to

00:21:35.699 --> 00:21:40.199
Caption: governments around the world as well so

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.119
Caption: the

00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:44.939
Caption: the

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:46.739
Caption: we&#39;ve seen slow progress but in some

00:21:44.939 --> 00:21:48.239
Caption: sense that&#39;s the kind of progress you

00:21:46.739 --> 00:21:49.979
Caption: want to see for new technology you don&#39;t

00:21:48.239 --> 00:21:51.359
Caption: want to see stuff like web3 or

00:21:49.979 --> 00:21:54.599
Caption: blockchain or whatever where it&#39;s just

00:21:51.359 --> 00:21:57.599
Caption: type and then disappears this is really

00:21:54.599 --> 00:22:01.918
Caption: new transformative technology that

00:21:57.599 --> 00:22:02.900
Caption: requires a slow pace because it&#39;s very

00:22:01.918 --> 00:22:06.479
Caption: difficult

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:10.159
Caption: so it&#39;s going to require a lot of effort

00:22:06.479 --> 00:22:13.260
Caption: and now is really the time when I think

00:22:10.159 --> 00:22:16.140
Caption: people like you in the audience

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.539
Caption: might consider getting involved because

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:20.760
Caption: there are devices available

00:22:18.538 --> 00:22:23.339
Caption: and they&#39;re currently being programmed

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.558
Caption: by physicists and if you&#39;ve ever seen

00:22:23.339 --> 00:22:27.000
Caption: physicist code

00:22:25.558 --> 00:22:30.079
Caption: you can see that this is going to lead

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.079
Caption: to a huge disaster

00:22:30.178 --> 00:22:33.599
Caption: um

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:36.659
Caption: there&#39;s there&#39;s a thriving open source

00:22:33.599 --> 00:22:39.058
Caption: community in Quantum development a few

00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:41.059
Caption: of my colleagues live stream on Twitch

00:22:39.058 --> 00:22:43.260
Caption: Quantum development

00:22:41.058 --> 00:22:44.699
Caption: so it&#39;s definitely something that&#39;s

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.558
Caption: that&#39;s happening now and you can get in

00:22:44.699 --> 00:22:49.199
Caption: early

00:22:46.558 --> 00:22:50.279
Caption: um and and into this new Mason exciting

00:22:49.199 --> 00:22:51.359
Caption: field

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.820
Caption: um so that&#39;s all I wanted to tell you

00:22:51.359 --> 00:22:57.298
Caption: today and I&#39;m happy to take any any

00:22:53.819 --> 00:23:00.418
Caption: questions uh about Quantum technology or

00:22:57.298 --> 00:23:02.099
Caption: children&#39;s books

00:23:00.418 --> 00:23:07.039
Caption: thank you

00:23:02.099 --> 00:23:07.039
Caption: [Applause]

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.820
Caption: I think there&#39;s some microphones yeah

00:23:17.579 --> 00:23:23.058
Caption: there&#39;s one up way up there

00:23:19.918 --> 00:23:23.058
Caption: the furthest away

00:23:24.239 --> 00:23:27.439
Caption: go over there next

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:34.919
Caption: hi thank you very much that was a great

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.839
Caption: talk um if you do you have any

00:23:34.918 --> 00:23:38.519
Caption: recommendations on where to get started

00:23:36.839 --> 00:23:39.900
Caption: with Quantum development how to get

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.299
Caption: involved in the community anything like

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:45.239
Caption: that because it does sound interesting

00:23:42.298 --> 00:23:46.678
Caption: yeah so I I I would suggest starting

00:23:45.239 --> 00:23:50.339
Caption: with

00:23:46.678 --> 00:23:52.579
Caption: um there&#39;s there&#39;s this non-for-profit

00:23:50.339 --> 00:23:55.739
Caption: called the unitary fund

00:23:52.579 --> 00:23:58.439
Caption: and it&#39;s a it&#39;s probably the largest

00:23:55.739 --> 00:24:00.839
Caption: open source Quantum community so if you

00:23:58.439 --> 00:24:03.000
Caption: look up unitary fund

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:05.158
Caption: um and they they&#39;ll give small grants

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.439
Caption: and stuff to people who are interested

00:24:05.159 --> 00:24:10.620
Caption: in in you know

00:24:07.439 --> 00:24:13.019
Caption: adding uh you know adding small

00:24:10.619 --> 00:24:14.339
Caption: components to existing open source

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:17.339
Caption: projects

00:24:14.339 --> 00:24:19.079
Caption: yeah and and I would say

00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:21.900
Caption: the majority of people

00:24:19.079 --> 00:24:24.479
Caption: don&#39;t have a background like they&#39;re not

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.520
Caption: PhD Quantum physicists in that Community

00:24:24.479 --> 00:24:29.339
Caption: like they&#39;re people coming from outside

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.380
Caption: of of the of the more traditional

00:24:29.339 --> 00:24:34.380
Caption: Quantum Computing community

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:36.979
Caption: so it&#39;s it&#39;s a very welcoming a very

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.979
Caption: welcoming community

00:24:38.939 --> 00:24:41.779
Caption: any other questions

00:24:45.298 --> 00:24:48.500
Caption: I think there&#39;s one down here

00:24:54.538 --> 00:25:01.079
Caption: how many cubits are we looking at before

00:24:57.359 --> 00:25:03.199
Caption: RSA becomes completely useless

00:25:01.079 --> 00:25:03.199
Caption: um

00:25:03.538 --> 00:25:10.379
Caption: Millions

00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:12.239
Caption: yeah it depends on so

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.859
Caption: the problem today

00:25:12.239 --> 00:25:18.780
Caption: is that

00:25:13.859 --> 00:25:19.439
Caption: qubits are very fragile so a bit

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.559
Caption: um

00:25:19.439 --> 00:25:25.399
Caption: you know a transistor

00:25:22.558 --> 00:25:27.899
Caption: has an error like one in a billion right

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.640
Caption: so but if now that you have a billion in

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.739
Caption: your device they happen quite often so

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.599
Caption: active air correction is is important

00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:35.038
Caption: but it&#39;s far more important for for

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:36.359
Caption: qubits

00:25:35.038 --> 00:25:38.819
Caption: of

00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:41.699
Caption: where we&#39;re not at the stage where we we

00:25:38.819 --> 00:25:44.278
Caption: have error corrected qubits we don&#39;t

00:25:41.699 --> 00:25:47.219
Caption: have perfectly operating devices

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:49.919
Caption: the better we make the physical qubits

00:25:47.219 --> 00:25:52.439
Caption: the fewer we need like the less overhead

00:25:49.918 --> 00:25:55.199
Caption: we need the less redundancy we need so

00:25:52.439 --> 00:25:57.239
Caption: the estimates now are a million but it

00:25:55.199 --> 00:25:59.760
Caption: it could be could be less

00:25:57.239 --> 00:26:01.859
Caption: like that&#39;s the worst case scenario

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.500
Caption: and if you look at the trend it looks to

00:26:01.859 --> 00:26:07.859
Caption: be like a Moore&#39;s Law of qubits that&#39;s

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:09.178
Caption: maybe 30 to 50 years

00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:11.099
Caption: from now

00:26:09.178 --> 00:26:13.079
Caption: so

00:26:11.099 --> 00:26:14.579
Caption: the US government for example has moved

00:26:13.079 --> 00:26:16.979
Caption: to post Quantum cryptography already

00:26:14.579 --> 00:26:19.859
Caption: because they have 30-year Secrets

00:26:16.979 --> 00:26:21.900
Caption: probably so if you have a secret you

00:26:19.859 --> 00:26:24.119
Caption: need to keep for 30 years then

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:27.559
Caption: maybe it&#39;s maybe it&#39;s time to to think

00:26:24.119 --> 00:26:27.558
Caption: about post Quantum cryptography

00:26:29.579 --> 00:26:32.959
Caption: I have 30 year old secrets

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:40.200
Caption: is there a question up here

00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:43.860
Caption: oh over here sorry

00:26:40.199 --> 00:26:45.778
Caption: in your opinion did Google truly achieve

00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:50.038
Caption: Quantum Supremacy

00:26:45.779 --> 00:26:51.000
Caption: uh yeah so there&#39;s this idea that

00:26:50.038 --> 00:26:52.979
Caption: um

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.140
Caption: there&#39;s nothing a quantum computer can

00:26:52.979 --> 00:27:01.678
Caption: do today that my mobile phone can&#39;t do

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:03.539
Caption: as but as quantum computers get bigger

00:27:01.678 --> 00:27:07.918
Caption: every time you add a qubit

00:27:03.538 --> 00:27:11.158
Caption: uh the complexity doubles so it grows

00:27:07.918 --> 00:27:13.798
Caption: exponentially so at some point Quantum

00:27:11.159 --> 00:27:15.480
Caption: technology will overtake conventional

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:18.000
Caption: digital technology

00:27:15.479 --> 00:27:18.778
Caption: uh and Google claimed to had had done

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.599
Caption: that

00:27:18.779 --> 00:27:22.619
Caption: probably three or four years ago at this

00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:24.778
Caption: point

00:27:22.619 --> 00:27:27.599
Caption: but it&#39;s it&#39;s not something that&#39;s easy

00:27:24.779 --> 00:27:28.380
Caption: to prove right

00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:29.880
Caption: um

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.699
Caption: and

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.619
Caption: I think with hindsight we would say no

00:27:32.699 --> 00:27:38.219
Caption: that that isn&#39;t the case because people

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:40.619
Caption: have improved upon existing ways to

00:27:38.219 --> 00:27:42.959
Caption: simulate quantum computers

00:27:40.619 --> 00:27:46.020
Caption: that can easily replicate what Google

00:27:42.959 --> 00:27:48.298
Caption: did on their devices so it&#39;s a sort of

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:50.959
Caption: at the moment we&#39;re at this sort of cusp

00:27:48.298 --> 00:27:52.918
Caption: where yeah

00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:54.418
Caption: increasing the capacity of quantum

00:27:52.918 --> 00:27:56.219
Caption: technology

00:27:54.418 --> 00:27:59.759
Caption: provides a challenge for conventional

00:27:56.219 --> 00:28:01.979
Caption: technology that may easily may be easy

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.419
Caption: to overcome because you know

00:28:01.979 --> 00:28:05.219
Caption: this isn&#39;t something that people think

00:28:03.418 --> 00:28:07.380
Caption: about all the time so not a lot of

00:28:05.219 --> 00:28:08.459
Caption: effort has been put into

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.959
Caption: uh

00:28:08.459 --> 00:28:11.278
Caption: simulating

00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:14.219
Caption: circuits that are built of

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:16.320
Caption: superconductors for example but you know

00:28:14.219 --> 00:28:18.959
Caption: when smart people go and and try to

00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:21.599
Caption: figure it out that it turns out that it

00:28:18.959 --> 00:28:23.520
Caption: can be done but eventually it&#39;ll just be

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:25.798
Caption: impossible there will be

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.260
Caption: if you think about it this way

00:28:25.798 --> 00:28:30.899
Caption: if you could build the device with 300

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:33.178
Caption: qubits then the number of possible

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.859
Caption: States in that superposition that I

00:28:33.178 --> 00:28:37.918
Caption: showed you would be more than the number

00:28:34.859 --> 00:28:40.619
Caption: of particles in the universe so

00:28:37.918 --> 00:28:42.538
Caption: we won&#39;t be able to do it with with bits

00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:44.699
Caption: of information at some point

00:28:42.538 --> 00:28:47.219
Caption: where that point is I don&#39;t know it&#39;s

00:28:44.699 --> 00:28:51.418
Caption: you know it could be now it could have

00:28:47.219 --> 00:28:53.599
Caption: been two years ago with but yeah

00:28:51.418 --> 00:28:56.819
Caption: I&#39;ll also point out that

00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:59.219
Caption: they&#39;re just trying to demonstrate that

00:28:56.819 --> 00:29:01.918
Caption: their device can do something that

00:28:59.219 --> 00:29:04.260
Caption: conventional technology can&#39;t simulate

00:29:01.918 --> 00:29:07.819
Caption: like I can&#39;t use a conventional computer

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.820
Caption: to simulate what that device did

00:29:07.859 --> 00:29:11.939
Caption: that thing that the device that did was

00:29:10.199 --> 00:29:14.459
Caption: wasn&#39;t useful for anything other than to

00:29:11.939 --> 00:29:16.918
Caption: demonstrate that one thing so

00:29:14.459 --> 00:29:18.778
Caption: um it&#39;s not like it was solving actually

00:29:16.918 --> 00:29:20.278
Caption: real world problems or anything we&#39;re

00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:25.100
Caption: not there yet that&#39;s going to require

00:29:20.279 --> 00:29:25.100
Caption: thousands to millions of qubits

00:29:30.298 --> 00:29:34.079
Caption: is there any other questions

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.219
Caption: no

00:29:34.079 --> 00:29:38.158
Caption: hi

00:29:35.219 --> 00:29:41.479
Caption: oh we need a microphone

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:41.480
Caption: there&#39;s one coming from behind you

00:29:42.298 --> 00:29:46.099
Caption: oh hi

00:29:44.298 --> 00:29:48.778
Caption: that&#39;s okay

00:29:46.099 --> 00:29:51.119
Caption: quantum computer handle memory leakages

00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:54.000
Caption: sorry can you say it again can a quantum

00:29:51.119 --> 00:29:56.099
Caption: computer handle memory leakages like we

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.380
Caption: Face a lot of memory leakage issues in

00:29:56.099 --> 00:30:00.778
Caption: classical computers so can a quantum

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:02.399
Caption: computer handle that

00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:05.700
Caption: um

00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:07.559
Caption: so there are

00:30:05.699 --> 00:30:09.359
Caption: there&#39;s a there&#39;s a website it&#39;s called

00:30:07.558 --> 00:30:10.859
Caption: the quantum algorithm Zoo

00:30:09.359 --> 00:30:13.079
Caption: and it has

00:30:10.859 --> 00:30:14.579
Caption: a couple dozen

00:30:13.079 --> 00:30:16.619
Caption: problems

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:19.019
Caption: that

00:30:16.619 --> 00:30:22.439
Caption: uh Quantum Quantum algorithms exist for

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:24.359
Caption: that are better than known classical

00:30:22.439 --> 00:30:26.939
Caption: algorithms

00:30:24.359 --> 00:30:29.239
Caption: but standard things like representing

00:30:26.939 --> 00:30:32.398
Caption: data adding numbers things like that the

00:30:29.239 --> 00:30:35.399
Caption: overhead actually makes it worse so a

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:37.799
Caption: quantum computer won&#39;t be better than a

00:30:35.399 --> 00:30:39.840
Caption: classical computer at everything there

00:30:37.798 --> 00:30:43.500
Caption: are a few special problems for which

00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:45.599
Caption: that kind of new data is a more natural

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:49.099
Caption: or better representation

00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:49.099
Caption: yeah thank you

00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:52.760
Caption: I think it was up here

00:30:57.779 --> 00:31:01.980
Caption: hi thanks for the talk that was really

00:31:00.599 --> 00:31:04.678
Caption: fascinating

00:31:01.979 --> 00:31:06.839
Caption: um so I have a question uh realistically

00:31:04.678 --> 00:31:08.339
Caption: in the future how do you see quantum

00:31:06.839 --> 00:31:10.199
Caption: computers are being used will they

00:31:08.339 --> 00:31:11.579
Caption: replace all traditional Alternatives

00:31:10.199 --> 00:31:14.699
Caption: that we use now

00:31:11.579 --> 00:31:17.158
Caption: and if so what what are the top three

00:31:14.699 --> 00:31:20.579
Caption: problems that Humanity needs to solve in

00:31:17.159 --> 00:31:22.620
Caption: order to achieve that thank you right

00:31:20.579 --> 00:31:24.119
Caption: so I think the way that it will progress

00:31:22.619 --> 00:31:26.640
Caption: is

00:31:24.119 --> 00:31:30.239
Caption: um first we&#39;ll see

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.979
Caption: a cloud cloud-based devices because

00:31:30.239 --> 00:31:32.880
Caption: there will be there will be very few of

00:31:31.979 --> 00:31:36.319
Caption: them

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:38.459
Caption: and they also require

00:31:36.319 --> 00:31:41.579
Caption: if we don&#39;t make

00:31:38.459 --> 00:31:43.739
Caption: you know basically Nobel prize winning

00:31:41.579 --> 00:31:46.678
Caption: improvements in materials

00:31:43.739 --> 00:31:49.859
Caption: these things require extreme

00:31:46.678 --> 00:31:51.658
Caption: environments so ultra high vacuum like

00:31:49.859 --> 00:31:54.719
Caption: fewer fewer particles than you would

00:31:51.659 --> 00:31:57.960
Caption: find in outer space or cools with liquid

00:31:54.719 --> 00:31:59.939
Caption: helium which makes these these sort of

00:31:57.959 --> 00:32:02.579
Caption: refrigerators that they&#39;re housed in the

00:31:59.939 --> 00:32:04.859
Caption: coldest places in the universe

00:32:02.579 --> 00:32:07.979
Caption: you don&#39;t you don&#39;t want your average

00:32:04.859 --> 00:32:10.020
Caption: consumer I think to have to handle that

00:32:07.979 --> 00:32:11.579
Caption: um so there&#39;ll be cloud-based devices

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.320
Caption: initially

00:32:11.579 --> 00:32:14.699
Caption: uh

00:32:13.319 --> 00:32:18.239
Caption: but

00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:21.000
Caption: even if we end up finding a way to

00:32:18.239 --> 00:32:22.439
Caption: miniaturize it and make it work at room

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.779
Caption: temperature

00:32:22.439 --> 00:32:27.778
Caption: they&#39;ll still be special purpose

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:29.580
Caption: components it&#39;ll be like you know you

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:33.480
Caption: have your GPU and maybe you have your

00:32:29.579 --> 00:32:35.219
Caption: TPU and you&#39;ll have your qpu all you

00:32:33.479 --> 00:32:37.319
Caption: know handled by it

00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:39.199
Caption: you know your existing computer your

00:32:37.319 --> 00:32:42.058
Caption: existing CPU will just Outsource

00:32:39.199 --> 00:32:43.918
Caption: particular calculations that it knows

00:32:42.058 --> 00:32:46.199
Caption: will be more efficiently run on the

00:32:43.918 --> 00:32:49.319
Caption: quantum processor

00:32:46.199 --> 00:32:50.699
Caption: oh and you had the other question so I

00:32:49.319 --> 00:32:53.959
Caption: don&#39;t think it&#39;ll ever be used to break

00:32:50.699 --> 00:32:53.959
Caption: RSA because

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.520
Caption: we&#39;ll move Beyond uh we&#39;ll move beyond

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:03.058
Caption: that

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:06.419
Caption: the most promising application is

00:33:03.058 --> 00:33:08.158
Caption: using Quantum systems to simulate other

00:33:06.418 --> 00:33:10.139
Caption: Quantum systems

00:33:08.159 --> 00:33:12.360
Caption: so right now

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:15.299
Caption: it&#39;s very difficult to simulate chemical

00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:17.398
Caption: interactions just because again as I

00:33:15.298 --> 00:33:19.739
Caption: said you know a chemical might have more

00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:22.260
Caption: than 300 atoms in it and so the number

00:33:19.739 --> 00:33:23.899
Caption: of states it can be in is more than the

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:26.399
Caption: number of particles in the universe so

00:33:23.899 --> 00:33:29.700
Caption: conventional technology has a real hard

00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:30.720
Caption: time representing that rich data with

00:33:29.699 --> 00:33:33.239
Caption: bits

00:33:30.719 --> 00:33:36.479
Caption: and so when you&#39;re designing vaccines

00:33:33.239 --> 00:33:39.839
Caption: and drugs and stuff you&#39;re you can do

00:33:36.479 --> 00:33:41.819
Caption: some heuristic things and you can do

00:33:39.839 --> 00:33:43.018
Caption: really coarse grain simulations but

00:33:41.819 --> 00:33:45.538
Caption: ultimately

00:33:43.019 --> 00:33:48.600
Caption: you have to make a guess

00:33:45.538 --> 00:33:50.639
Caption: build the drug stick it in mice find out

00:33:48.599 --> 00:33:53.000
Caption: what happens right

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:55.200
Caption: in the future if we&#39;re able to simulate

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.659
Caption: the interaction between biological

00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:59.398
Caption: models in a virtual environment then

00:33:57.659 --> 00:34:01.559
Caption: that will just that will be truly

00:33:59.399 --> 00:34:05.519
Caption: transformational we&#39;ll be able to design

00:34:01.558 --> 00:34:07.319
Caption: new drugs new vaccines new materials all

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:10.500
Caption: in a virtual environment before we have

00:34:07.319 --> 00:34:13.138
Caption: to go out and spend the money to to

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:15.178
Caption: build the actual thing

00:34:13.138 --> 00:34:19.280
Caption: I think that&#39;ll be the number one

00:34:15.178 --> 00:34:19.280
Caption: uh yeah the number one application

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.700
Caption: where&#39;s the microphone I can&#39;t see

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.379
Caption: oh here

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:30.178
Caption: um how come you didn&#39;t say study Physics

00:34:28.378 --> 00:34:32.579
Caption: as a prerequisite to getting into

00:34:30.178 --> 00:34:33.658
Caption: Quantum computing

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:37.080
Caption: so

00:34:33.658 --> 00:34:38.819
Caption: uh quantum mechanics study Physics

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.800
Caption: physics background have a Physics degree

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:44.359
Caption: it&#39;s like studying computer science to

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:47.280
Caption: do programming Etc so fundamentals

00:34:44.358 --> 00:34:49.259
Caption: I think I mean that&#39;s just a historical

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.138
Caption: Quirk that the people who invented the

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:54.479
Caption: field were physicists and so the

00:34:52.138 --> 00:34:57.479
Caption: language in jargon is all physics jargon

00:34:54.479 --> 00:35:01.139
Caption: but that&#39;s changing so at the University

00:34:57.479 --> 00:35:03.118
Caption: of Technology Sydney you can get a

00:35:01.139 --> 00:35:06.059
Caption: Bachelor of Computer Science and major

00:35:03.118 --> 00:35:07.679
Caption: in Quantum computation so I teach

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.180
Caption: introduction to Quantum computation to

00:35:07.679 --> 00:35:10.618
Caption: people who&#39;ve never taken a Physics

00:35:09.179 --> 00:35:14.219
Caption: course at all

00:35:10.618 --> 00:35:16.679
Caption: there&#39;s no physics jargon in it and we

00:35:14.219 --> 00:35:19.020
Caption: start with programming we build a

00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:22.078
Caption: Quantum tic-tac-toe game and we run it

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:24.300
Caption: on a quantum computer and they don&#39;t

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:26.280
Caption: need to I mean I could do it without

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.260
Caption: even using the word superposition and

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:30.119
Caption: entanglement you know once you just

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:32.280
Caption: specify the rules and the grammar and

00:35:30.118 --> 00:35:33.899
Caption: the syntax of the quantum programming

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.560
Caption: language then it&#39;s just like any other

00:35:33.899 --> 00:35:36.559
Caption: computer science

00:35:38.879 --> 00:35:42.358
Caption: did the microphone

00:35:41.399 --> 00:35:44.939
Caption: hello

00:35:42.358 --> 00:35:47.519
Caption: um so schroding is cat represented an

00:35:44.939 --> 00:35:49.679
Caption: era of quantum Computing

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.179
Caption: um where we had Leaps and Bounds in

00:35:49.679 --> 00:35:54.419
Caption: Discovery and understanding but that was

00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:57.239
Caption: like the 20s like 1920s and 1930s what

00:35:54.419 --> 00:35:59.520
Caption: do you think is next for quantum theory

00:35:57.239 --> 00:36:02.659
Caption: like the next big thing

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.659
Caption: oh that&#39;s a good question

00:36:02.939 --> 00:36:06.540
Caption: so the

00:36:04.739 --> 00:36:08.639
Caption: you know the questions that Schrodinger

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.540
Caption: raised are unresolved

00:36:08.639 --> 00:36:11.159
Caption: um

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:13.260
Caption: you know we don&#39;t

00:36:11.159 --> 00:36:14.760
Caption: we don&#39;t really know what the nature of

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.280
Caption: reality is we know that quantum

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:20.280
Caption: mechanics is wrong in some sense

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.199
Caption: we have two main theories in physics

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.719
Caption: Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity

00:36:22.199 --> 00:36:26.639
Caption: which works for large-scale things

00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:30.118
Caption: and quantum mechanics which works for

00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:33.419
Caption: small scale things and they&#39;re

00:36:30.118 --> 00:36:35.399
Caption: completely incompatible so one of them

00:36:33.419 --> 00:36:39.179
Caption: is wrong or they&#39;re both wrong which is

00:36:35.399 --> 00:36:41.760
Caption: the more likely scenario uh and that&#39;s

00:36:39.179 --> 00:36:45.179
Caption: kind of what most theoretical physicists

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:46.859
Caption: think about at least the ones that

00:36:45.179 --> 00:36:49.578
Caption: um have tenure

00:36:46.858 --> 00:36:49.578
Caption: they

00:36:50.719 --> 00:36:55.618
Caption: they think about how do you bring these

00:36:54.239 --> 00:36:57.899
Caption: two things together you know it&#39;s what

00:36:55.618 --> 00:36:59.939
Caption: Einstein spent the most most of his life

00:36:57.899 --> 00:37:01.919
Caption: trying to figure out

00:36:59.939 --> 00:37:04.679
Caption: I mean he kind of invented both of the

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:07.739
Caption: theories and then spent the rest of his

00:37:04.679 --> 00:37:10.139
Caption: life trying to put them together uh

00:37:07.739 --> 00:37:12.358
Caption: so doing that or coming up with a

00:37:10.139 --> 00:37:15.118
Caption: completely new theory that supersedes

00:37:12.358 --> 00:37:16.919
Caption: both general relativity and quantum

00:37:15.118 --> 00:37:19.739
Caption: mechanics and you can get some pretty

00:37:16.919 --> 00:37:21.299
Caption: wild speculations like the universe is a

00:37:19.739 --> 00:37:24.839
Caption: hologram

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:26.640
Caption: um or you know a black hole is really a

00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:29.220
Caption: quantum computer these sorts of things

00:37:26.639 --> 00:37:31.219
Caption: uh are what people talk about at

00:37:29.219 --> 00:37:32.760
Caption: theoretical physics conferences

00:37:31.219 --> 00:37:34.858
Caption: I

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.399
Caption: I yeah

00:37:34.858 --> 00:37:37.319
Caption: um

00:37:35.399 --> 00:37:38.699
Caption: I guess I&#39;m not old and cranky enough to

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.560
Caption: think about that sort of stuff I still

00:37:38.699 --> 00:37:42.118
Caption: write

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.839
Caption: I just write research grants and

00:37:42.118 --> 00:37:44.838
Caption: children&#39;s books

00:37:50.399 --> 00:37:53.299
Caption: are there any other questions

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.119
Caption: there&#39;s one down here

00:37:59.879 --> 00:38:03.618
Caption: oh and there&#39;s one over there

00:38:05.579 --> 00:38:10.859
Caption: uh thanks for your talk I was going to

00:38:07.739 --> 00:38:13.858
Caption: change Tech and talk about your uh you

00:38:10.858 --> 00:38:15.779
Caption: know being an author can you describe a

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:18.779
Caption: bit of your creative process from being

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:21.060
Caption: a scientist to then communicating what a

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.820
Caption: quiet you know obscure or perhaps

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:26.640
Caption: esoteric Concepts to such a junior

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:28.739
Caption: audience I mean what do you how do you

00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:31.379
Caption: even start that process

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:34.919
Caption: yeah so I think

00:38:31.379 --> 00:38:38.219
Caption: the motivation obviously was to for my

00:38:34.919 --> 00:38:39.838
Caption: to read to my own kids so I have four

00:38:38.219 --> 00:38:41.820
Caption: children and

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:45.239
Caption: I wanted to

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:47.099
Caption: read science books to them and this was

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:49.020
Caption: maybe eight years ago

00:38:47.099 --> 00:38:51.000
Caption: it didn&#39;t really exist

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:52.979
Caption: so I thought well I&#39;ll just try to do it

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.260
Caption: myself and and

00:38:52.979 --> 00:38:57.060
Caption: what better thing to write about for

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.800
Caption: children than quantum physics and so I

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:01.979
Caption: wrote

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.060
Caption: I wrote quantum physics for babies and

00:39:01.979 --> 00:39:04.379
Caption: um

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:08.219
Caption: and

00:39:04.379 --> 00:39:11.459
Caption: I I kind of approached it as I would my

00:39:08.219 --> 00:39:12.540
Caption: my own sort of teaching so I don&#39;t

00:39:11.459 --> 00:39:14.760
Caption: really

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:17.400
Caption: distinguish between an audience a

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.899
Caption: physicists and an audience of children

00:39:17.399 --> 00:39:20.819
Caption: um you know just

00:39:18.899 --> 00:39:22.379
Caption: key

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:26.540
Caption: keep it simple

00:39:22.379 --> 00:39:26.539
Caption: and use bright diagrams

00:39:26.579 --> 00:39:30.479
Caption: um

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:32.699
Caption: yeah and so I did that and it seemed to

00:39:30.479 --> 00:39:34.858
Caption: work out and some of the other like the

00:39:32.699 --> 00:39:37.199
Caption: book here was kind of modeled

00:39:34.858 --> 00:39:40.559
Caption: um Loosely on

00:39:37.199 --> 00:39:42.500
Caption: um you know the cat the cat in the hat

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.479
Caption: um although

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:47.099
Caption: this isn&#39;t going to go live oh it is

00:39:45.479 --> 00:39:49.439
Caption: live

00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:51.780
Caption: so if the Dr Seuss Foundation is

00:39:49.439 --> 00:39:53.159
Caption: listening it you didn&#39;t hear that part

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:56.219
Caption: um

00:39:53.159 --> 00:39:58.979
Caption: so I you know as a physicist or as a

00:39:56.219 --> 00:40:01.379
Caption: scientist you you&#39;re just naturally

00:39:58.979 --> 00:40:04.979
Caption: attuned to taking things that people

00:40:01.379 --> 00:40:06.479
Caption: have built and and simplifying them or

00:40:04.979 --> 00:40:08.219
Caption: looking at them in a different way or

00:40:06.479 --> 00:40:10.020
Caption: building upon them

00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:11.219
Caption: um usually to make them better now I

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:13.679
Caption: don&#39;t want to say that I made something

00:40:11.219 --> 00:40:16.800
Caption: better than Dr Seuss but the point is

00:40:13.679 --> 00:40:17.879
Caption: it&#39;s much easier to take something that

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.459
Caption: exists

00:40:17.879 --> 00:40:22.618
Caption: and then put your own spin or

00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:24.239
Caption: Improvement upon it and that&#39;s kind of

00:40:22.618 --> 00:40:25.939
Caption: what scientists do all the time nobody

00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:28.500
Caption: just invents a theory and vacuum right

00:40:25.939 --> 00:40:30.479
Caption: they they build upon the previous thing

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.099
Caption: it&#39;s all incremental and so for me it

00:40:30.479 --> 00:40:35.219
Caption: seems really like it&#39;s just a natural

00:40:32.099 --> 00:40:37.339
Caption: thing for me to do to say take something

00:40:35.219 --> 00:40:42.800
Caption: that exists and I know that works well

00:40:37.339 --> 00:40:42.800
Caption: and then add my own flavor to it

00:40:45.118 --> 00:40:47.098
Caption: can I

00:40:46.439 --> 00:40:49.800
Caption: um

00:40:47.099 --> 00:40:51.359
Caption: so like we see like say AI in the last

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.420
Caption: 10 years there&#39;s been a lot of like

00:40:51.358 --> 00:40:56.639
Caption: debates about ethics ethical problems

00:40:54.419 --> 00:40:58.379
Caption: and the such is there anything any

00:40:56.639 --> 00:40:59.519
Caption: um debates of that saw in the quantum

00:40:58.379 --> 00:41:02.879
Caption: world

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:05.339
Caption: it is it&#39;s very uh there&#39;s not a lot of

00:41:02.879 --> 00:41:06.239
Caption: people thinking about it

00:41:05.339 --> 00:41:09.359
Caption: um

00:41:06.239 --> 00:41:12.239
Caption: so yeah I think there was a white paper

00:41:09.358 --> 00:41:13.319
Caption: about about Quantum ethics

00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:16.739
Caption: um

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:18.900
Caption: and you know it&#39;s largely inspired by

00:41:16.739 --> 00:41:20.520
Caption: the debate in AI

00:41:18.899 --> 00:41:22.500
Caption: and

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.339
Caption: the argument is let&#39;s get on top of this

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.800
Caption: now

00:41:23.339 --> 00:41:27.480
Caption: or we&#39;re going to end up like AI

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.060
Caption: with a whole bunch of things to fix in

00:41:27.479 --> 00:41:30.899
Caption: the future

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:32.640
Caption: but

00:41:30.899 --> 00:41:36.118
Caption: you know without

00:41:32.639 --> 00:41:38.399
Caption: I think you really you can you we&#39;re

00:41:36.118 --> 00:41:39.899
Caption: watching an experiment right and the

00:41:38.399 --> 00:41:43.139
Caption: hypothesis is

00:41:39.899 --> 00:41:44.639
Caption: does money talk and yet yes it does so

00:41:43.139 --> 00:41:45.959
Caption: there&#39;s no money being put into that

00:41:44.639 --> 00:41:48.118
Caption: effort

00:41:45.959 --> 00:41:49.800
Caption: and there&#39;s money being put into just

00:41:48.118 --> 00:41:51.358
Caption: going and moving forward as fast as

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:55.040
Caption: possible

00:41:51.358 --> 00:41:58.618
Caption: um so it&#39;s it&#39;s going to be a challenge

00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:01.260
Caption: I my suspicion is like most things so

00:41:58.618 --> 00:42:03.779
Caption: just we&#39;re going to forge ahead with a

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:06.060
Caption: lot of stuff to clean up afterward but

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:09.479
Caption: there there is there is

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:12.839
Caption: so one of the one of the differences is

00:42:09.479 --> 00:42:16.020
Caption: that the promise of quantum technology

00:42:12.839 --> 00:42:17.640
Caption: and the likely path forward is that

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:20.939
Caption: at some point in the future there&#39;d be

00:42:17.639 --> 00:42:22.919
Caption: only a handful of these devices and

00:42:20.939 --> 00:42:25.739
Caption: they&#39;ll be extremely powerful

00:42:22.919 --> 00:42:29.280
Caption: like they can break RSA

00:42:25.739 --> 00:42:31.500
Caption: so there won&#39;t be Democratic access to

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.040
Caption: these these things

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.040
Caption: um

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:37.739
Caption: because of the way things are structured

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:39.479
Caption: and so that that&#39;s sort of the the major

00:42:37.739 --> 00:42:41.339
Caption: difference

00:42:39.479 --> 00:42:45.060
Caption: um in the debate

00:42:41.339 --> 00:42:47.220
Caption: between the quantum ethics and AI ethics

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:48.540
Caption: but certainly something that people

00:42:47.219 --> 00:42:51.320
Caption: think about

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:51.320
Caption: just not enough

00:42:54.959 --> 00:42:57.560
Caption: any more questions

00:43:05.219 --> 00:43:10.199
Caption: I see one just kind of following up from

00:43:07.858 --> 00:43:11.039
Caption: that uh the what you&#39;re just talking

00:43:10.199 --> 00:43:13.560
Caption: about

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:16.199
Caption: um so what does the career like look

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.819
Caption: like in Quantum Computing for let&#39;s say

00:43:16.199 --> 00:43:20.699
Caption: a student going through one of your

00:43:17.819 --> 00:43:22.500
Caption: classes right now what is the let&#39;s just

00:43:20.699 --> 00:43:24.358
Caption: say they&#39;re in their 20s and they&#39;re

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.699
Caption: going to spend an entire career what do

00:43:24.358 --> 00:43:29.578
Caption: you what do you think it would look like

00:43:26.699 --> 00:43:31.919
Caption: yeah so the quantum industry is large

00:43:29.579 --> 00:43:34.020
Caption: enough at this point

00:43:31.919 --> 00:43:35.338
Caption: that the majority of people that are in

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.439
Caption: it

00:43:35.339 --> 00:43:41.160
Caption: um don&#39;t really know anything about

00:43:37.439 --> 00:43:43.020
Caption: Quantum Computing at all so you know a

00:43:41.159 --> 00:43:44.780
Caption: Quantum Computing company

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:48.540
Caption: so I would say a Quantum startup company

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:51.959
Caption: needs to have a website so it needs web

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:54.719
Caption: designers right and

00:43:51.959 --> 00:43:58.078
Caption: I I work closely with a couple Quantum

00:43:54.719 --> 00:44:01.078
Caption: startups and you need remarkably little

00:43:58.079 --> 00:44:03.900
Caption: knowledge about Quantum Computing to if

00:44:01.079 --> 00:44:06.660
Caption: you have if you&#39;re a talented developer

00:44:03.899 --> 00:44:09.858
Caption: then you can learn all all you need to

00:44:06.659 --> 00:44:09.858
Caption: know on the on the job

00:44:10.139 --> 00:44:16.799
Caption: in so in our degree program there&#39;s kind

00:44:14.459 --> 00:44:18.439
Caption: of two Pathways there&#39;s sort of the

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:21.420
Caption: honors

00:44:18.439 --> 00:44:24.118
Caption: higher education pathway so if you want

00:44:21.419 --> 00:44:26.939
Caption: to be like a research scientist at a

00:44:24.118 --> 00:44:30.739
Caption: Quantum company then you still need a

00:44:26.939 --> 00:44:33.358
Caption: some some higher degree probably a PhD

00:44:30.739 --> 00:44:34.739
Caption: but then there&#39;s sort of the technology

00:44:33.358 --> 00:44:39.059
Caption: pathway

00:44:34.739 --> 00:44:41.159
Caption: where you&#39;ll be a computer scientist but

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:44.400
Caption: the quantum company won&#39;t have to spend

00:44:41.159 --> 00:44:47.399
Caption: eight months on some special induction

00:44:44.399 --> 00:44:49.439
Caption: about about Quantum Computing for you so

00:44:47.399 --> 00:44:52.260
Caption: you&#39;ll already be kind of well-versed in

00:44:49.439 --> 00:44:54.419
Caption: all of the language in lingo and nuances

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.459
Caption: that you would otherwise have to learn

00:44:54.419 --> 00:44:59.219
Caption: on the job but I speak to people who

00:44:56.459 --> 00:45:01.979
Caption: work at Quantum startup companies

00:44:59.219 --> 00:45:04.379
Caption: and they&#39;re like yeah I don&#39;t know I

00:45:01.979 --> 00:45:07.079
Caption: don&#39;t know any I don&#39;t know what like I

00:45:04.379 --> 00:45:08.578
Caption: I someone told me to program this thing

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:08.940
Caption: and I did it but I have no idea what it

00:45:08.579 --> 00:45:10.560
Caption: means

00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:14.118
Caption: [Laughter]

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.119
Caption: oh yeah

00:45:15.118 --> 00:45:21.179
Caption: probably like devs have you seen devs

00:45:18.179 --> 00:45:22.500
Caption: yeah if you haven&#39;t yeah devs is

00:45:21.179 --> 00:45:24.899
Caption: probably the if you really want to

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:28.379
Caption: figure out what a Quantum startup

00:45:24.899 --> 00:45:31.799
Caption: is like watch the I think it&#39;s on uh

00:45:28.379 --> 00:45:33.539
Caption: FX in in the US and then it&#39;s

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:37.079
Caption: I don&#39;t remember what what streaming

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:40.079
Caption: service is on here but yeah it&#39;s a

00:45:37.079 --> 00:45:42.619
Caption: it&#39;s a series about a Quantum Computing

00:45:40.079 --> 00:45:42.619
Caption: startup company

00:45:46.319 --> 00:45:51.440
Caption: all right thank you very much Chris

00:45:57.858 --> 00:46:02.299
Caption: thank you again for joining us today
