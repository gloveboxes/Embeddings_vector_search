Caption: great engagement scores in from one of

00:00:38.578 --> 00:00:44.128
Caption: my teams and that&#39;s what inspired me to

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:47.128
Caption: submit this talk a little bit of

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.930
Caption: background so my journey so far I&#39;ve

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.199
Caption: been in Perth for about five years now

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.709
Caption: I&#39;m from the UK where as a software

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.020
Caption: engineer and scrum master worked in

00:00:55.709 --> 00:01:01.259
Caption: easyJet in the airline industry for some

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.389
Caption: time doing DevOps scaled agile and some

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:05.279
Caption: early clouds since coming here I&#39;ve

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:07.769
Caption: worked with some really great people and

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:10.319
Caption: there&#39;s those are really familiar faces

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:13.649
Caption: out here and I&#39;ve been lucky enough to

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:15.869
Caption: work with some great teams I have been a

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.299
Caption: Bankwest previously for a couple of

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.509
Caption: years and proud to say I&#39;ve been part of

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.180
Caption: their their agile transformation and I&#39;m

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.110
Caption: now presently working for bhp in the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.059
Caption: strategy and innovation department so in

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.629
Caption: this talk we&#39;re going to talk about how

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:36.478
Caption: to build up a team what it means to have

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:39.258
Caption: a an effective and engaged team and then

00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:41.789
Caption: how to maintain that

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:46.020
Caption: so first up I&#39;ll start with a little

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.540
Caption: story I once landed on a project with a

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:51.539
Caption: team and it became evident quickly that

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.520
Caption: the the the people that have been hired

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.709
Caption: had basically been hired because they

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:58.048
Caption: were available yesterday they had a

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.839
Caption: quick phone interview the CV looked okay

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.880
Caption: and they&#39;d land them in and needless to

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:06.658
Caption: say that project didn&#39;t go very well it

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:09.750
Caption: was a struggle and that&#39;s exactly what

00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:12.330
Caption: you shouldn&#39;t do if you try and rush

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.839
Caption: your hiring process you get a short-term

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.389
Caption: gain

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:17.878
Caption: but obviously in the longer term you

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:20.669
Caption: will pay for it so I actually really

00:02:17.878 --> 00:02:22.979
Caption: enjoy hiring and I find it really

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:25.199
Caption: satisfying when you able to spot a good

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.878
Caption: talent and bring them into a team so

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:29.518
Caption: I&#39;ll just go through some of my

00:02:26.878 --> 00:02:32.970
Caption: processes that I do first up just take

00:02:29.518 --> 00:02:35.190
Caption: your time do it for aliy obviously lots

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.598
Caption: of Seavey&#39;s go through them re-read them

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.180
Caption: a couple of times it will start to blur

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:41.639
Caption: into one after a while so you know come

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:43.348
Caption: back the next day then when you do have

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.789
Caption: the people that you&#39;re interested in I

00:02:43.348 --> 00:02:47.039
Caption: like to just give them a quick phone

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:48.328
Caption: call maybe 15 minutes half an hour you

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:52.250
Caption: don&#39;t want to waste your time all right

00:02:48.328 --> 00:02:55.229
Caption: or theirs because it is a longer process

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.750
Caption: then when you do want to interview

00:02:55.229 --> 00:03:00.690
Caption: people get them in and always interview

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.000
Caption: in pairs so you get some different

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.190
Caption: perspectives now for software engineers

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.738
Caption: it&#39;s really important to do a code test

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.988
Caption: I&#39;ve interviewed tons of people that can

00:03:07.738 --> 00:03:11.369
Caption: talk the talk have great CVS but when

00:03:09.988 --> 00:03:13.319
Caption: you put them in front of a key ball that

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:15.779
Caption: they just fall flat and the same goes

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.729
Caption: for all types as well solution

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.708
Caption: architects give them a code test as well

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:23.099
Caption: give them an exercise around a

00:03:19.708 --> 00:03:29.399
Caption: whiteboard and you know stimulate some

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:31.410
Caption: scrum if you&#39;re hiring Scott masters now

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:33.059
Caption: if you do find good talent just move

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.708
Caption: really quickly because in this industry

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:41.130
Caption: it doesn&#39;t hang along for for very for

00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:44.190
Caption: people go really quickly and start small

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.319
Caption: feel the pain before you grow too

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.809
Caption: quickly start with the key roles that

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.848
Caption: you need and then grow a bit by bit and

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:55.009
Caption: one really important thing that I always

00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:57.449
Caption: like to say is and it&#39;s a key tip is

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:59.548
Caption: always take it back to the team once

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.979
Caption: you&#39;ve got a team established ask them

00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:02.608
Caption: who they need ask them which roles are

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.259
Caption: missing

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:07.168
Caption: get them involved in the interviewing

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:09.689
Caption: process because it&#39;s their team members

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.069
Caption: at the end of the day don&#39;t suppose what

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.139
Caption: you think they need and hire that&#39;s

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.940
Caption: that&#39;s not good now when you do have the

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.809
Caption: team you want to foster this one team

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.119
Caption: mindset and to do that you need to try

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:26.519
Caption: and break down the job titles you need

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:31.949
Caption: to have a team where people will all

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:33.989
Caption: serve different roles now to be

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.580
Caption: cross-functional is important but that

00:04:33.989 --> 00:04:38.638
Caption: doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t have

00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:40.168
Caption: specialists in your team so as you can

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.210
Caption: see up here there&#39;s this analogy of

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.789
Caption: being t-shaped so this is where you have

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:46.109
Caption: people that have deep rooted

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.509
Caption: specializations in certain areas and

00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:50.459
Caption: then they&#39;ll have a wide ability of

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.529
Caption: different skill sets so given your

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:54.569
Caption: context you may need people that are

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:58.130
Caption: really good at databases you might need

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.440
Caption: front-end JavaScript skills so embrace

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.559
Caption: cross-functional teams they encourage

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.649
Caption: specialization in the right areas now

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:10.769
Caption: getting this mindset and this team takes

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:12.690
Caption: time so one way to breach that that is

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:14.759
Caption: to bring in some experience and some

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.009
Caption: really good developers people that have

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:21.449
Caption: been in hard performing teams previously

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:23.069
Caption: and one thing that&#39;s becoming more and

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.830
Caption: more popular now is the concept of

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:27.690
Caption: sticky teams instead of having a project

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:29.098
Caption: where you build up your team and then

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.979
Caption: disband them and build them up again

00:05:29.098 --> 00:05:33.718
Caption: actually fund the product longer term or

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.690
Caption: as in kind of Bankwest are doing it now

00:05:33.718 --> 00:05:39.209
Caption: these days funding experience areas

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.069
Caption: because it can take six months to really

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:43.109
Caption: get a team firing so you don&#39;t want to

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:47.789
Caption: keep chopping and changing that&#39;s really

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:50.638
Caption: wasteful now this slide is the favorite

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:54.000
Caption: side of my eight-year-old daughter so

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.610
Caption: people say there&#39;s no iron team well

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.739
Caption: that&#39;s rubbish there is bit cheesy but

00:05:56.609 --> 00:06:02.908
Caption: it&#39;s important we all have our plots

00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:05.908
Caption: part to play and we all contribute to

00:06:02.908 --> 00:06:07.139
Caption: that cohesive collective unit so what

00:06:05.908 --> 00:06:09.059
Caption: I&#39;m going to do now is I&#39;m going to talk

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.740
Caption: you through a few different character

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:14.069
Caption: types that are important if you want to

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:16.348
Caption: have a really great team and how you

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:18.809
Caption: might go about designing that into your

00:06:16.348 --> 00:06:20.908
Caption: structures so I might just read some of

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:22.949
Caption: these off if that&#39;s okay so the lead

00:06:20.908 --> 00:06:25.049
Caption: engineer so this person sits to

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.270
Caption: technical standards she will conduct

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:29.309
Caption: hardest interviews in a generally work

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:31.709
Caption: technical magic she&#39;ll raise everyone&#39;s

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:33.989
Caption: technical bar and this is usually what

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:36.959
Caption: someone says oh they mean the 10 times

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:38.848
Caption: developer type which is a bit of a

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:39.509
Caption: disputed term but I believe these

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:41.750
Caption: unicorns

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.790
Caption: do exist and have worked for something

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.320
Caption: the hustla they&#39;ll bend the rules when

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.700
Caption: they need to get stuff done they&#39;ll find

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.740
Caption: their little loopholes in the system

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.350
Caption: they&#39;ll have to give her things to

00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:55.380
Caption: extract data and they set the standard

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.690
Caption: for just getting done and they will

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.110
Caption: also challenge the team in their very

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:03.179
Caption: thinking of how to go about that now the

00:07:01.109 --> 00:07:05.669
Caption: little engine that could refuses to lose

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:09.869
Caption: she manages great things with sheer

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:11.460
Caption: determination sometimes it&#39;s hard to

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:14.279
Caption: find out this person but you can dig a

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:15.839
Caption: bit deeper in interviews and having

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:18.450
Caption: someone that listen as he makes everyone

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:21.320
Caption: more driven more focused and makes them

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:25.170
Caption: believe that great things are possible

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.450
Caption: the teacher they soak up information and

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.190
Caption: disseminate that amongst the team

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.260
Caption: they&#39;re constantly learning new

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.820
Caption: technologies or synthesizing large

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.950
Caption: amounts of information

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:39.089
Caption: now what they&#39;ll do is they&#39;re then

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:42.210
Caption: distill these critical pieces back to

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:44.369
Caption: the team given the right context over

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:46.649
Caption: time this makes everyone more productive

00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:50.760
Caption: almost immediately and over the years

00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:52.619
Caption: adds up tremendously the troops are this

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.050
Caption: is someone that&#39;s willing to call out on

00:07:52.619 --> 00:07:59.489
Caption: anyone and this is the CEO of the

00:07:55.049 --> 00:08:01.739
Caption: company or whoever need you know whoever

00:07:59.489 --> 00:08:03.690
Caption: that may be she&#39;s willing to ask the

00:08:01.739 --> 00:08:06.809
Caption: tough questions and it keeps the team

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:08.989
Caption: honest and the company transparent now

00:08:06.809 --> 00:08:13.200
Caption: this is different from being disrupt

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:15.839
Caption: disruptive or negative in it in a bad

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:19.650
Caption: way it&#39;s more about keeping people

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:21.889
Caption: honest and sticking to the facts the

00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:24.329
Caption: Energizer this is someone that froze

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:26.400
Caption: themselves into the task fully and

00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:28.649
Caption: doesn&#39;t have an off switch she gets

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:31.979
Caption: everyone to give 100% it&#39;s so infused

00:08:28.649 --> 00:08:33.419
Caption: everyone else becomes infused she sets

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.070
Caption: the bar for effort it makes everyone

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:38.340
Caption: want to work harder just they don&#39;t

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:39.479
Caption: disappoint her to extend this outside of

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.760
Caption: work this will be the kind of person

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:44.940
Caption: that&#39;s the first one to the pie and the

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.040
Caption: last one to leave now the last one in

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:50.099
Caption: the team the heart so this is the person

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:50.609
Caption: that the team misses when they&#39;re not

00:08:50.099 --> 00:08:53.009
Caption: around

00:08:50.609 --> 00:08:55.469
Caption: she&#39;ll bring cookies into the office you

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.270
Caption: remember people&#39;s birthdays and she

00:08:55.469 --> 00:09:01.589
Caption: basically makes people feel better when

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:04.230
Caption: they&#39;re down people want to come to work

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:06.240
Caption: to see this person every day and having

00:09:04.229 --> 00:09:11.639
Caption: that is obviously a massive huge

00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:15.029
Caption: productivity boost so all these

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:17.010
Caption: different character types and diversity

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.480
Caption: and world types in mindsets in the way

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.970
Caption: people think are really important

00:09:18.479 --> 00:09:24.299
Caption: because what we typically do is we look

00:09:20.969 --> 00:09:25.589
Caption: for this 10 x developer this unicorn and

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:28.799
Caption: there are studies out there that show

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:30.809
Caption: these people exist but you don&#39;t want

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:32.070
Caption: ten of them in your team because you&#39;re

00:09:30.809 --> 00:09:34.529
Caption: not really going to function very well

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:36.450
Caption: what you want is to be able to design

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.580
Caption: the team and craft it in such a way that

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.859
Caption: you create a team that&#39;s 10 times more

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.299
Caption: productive you get the right characters

00:09:40.859 --> 00:09:44.729
Caption: that work well together and are

00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:47.039
Caption: effective so this is where I think the

00:09:44.729 --> 00:09:49.260
Caption: real value is where there are people

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:53.989
Caption: that are able to craft teams and help

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.989
Caption: them collaborate and and maintain that

00:09:55.309 --> 00:10:01.919
Caption: so something to avoid the DEF March so

00:09:59.909 --> 00:10:05.729
Caption: I&#39;m going to kind of talk you through

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:08.339
Caption: this and see pattern so you land on a

00:10:05.729 --> 00:10:10.649
Caption: project straight where this panic you

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:13.020
Caption: know that it&#39;s not achievable there&#39;s

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.930
Caption: been these grand promises lauded in by

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:17.700
Caption: the pre-sales team there are estimates

00:10:15.929 --> 00:10:19.770
Caption: that have been given by some lofty

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.660
Caption: Enterprise Architect it&#39;s going to be

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.540
Caption: nowhere near your project and comes from

00:10:21.659 --> 00:10:29.429
Caption: a different division and won&#39;t have any

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:31.979
Caption: skin in the game in this one now of

00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:35.700
Caption: course it&#39;s a fixed priced engagement

00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:37.169
Caption: and any changes that are inevitable as

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.419
Caption: the customer starts to learn more about

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:42.049
Caption: the domain will be shoved off into the

00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:45.450
Caption: hotly disputed change management process

00:10:42.049 --> 00:10:47.399
Caption: you&#39;ve landed on a feature that no one

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.169
Caption: really cares about but has to be

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.000
Caption: delivered because it&#39;s in the statement

00:10:49.169 --> 00:10:55.469
Caption: of work and relies upon a payment

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.179
Caption: milestone now inevitably the client

00:10:55.469 --> 00:10:59.719
Caption: starts to learn more about the domain

00:10:57.179 --> 00:11:03.570
Caption: and wants to change things right and

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:05.789
Caption: when the project starts to slip for six

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.020
Caption: months for nine months for 12 months

00:11:05.789 --> 00:11:09.029
Caption: that&#39;s when the

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:12.270
Caption: comes in and they take these new ideas

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:14.100
Caption: and renegotiate price and so forth and

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.170
Caption: the culture starts to die a little bit

00:11:14.099 --> 00:11:17.130
Caption: you go in there it&#39;s not a fun place to

00:11:16.169 --> 00:11:20.130
Caption: be anymore

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:23.190
Caption: in fact you kind of forget why your love

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.809
Caption: of coding came about you you don&#39;t look

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.830
Caption: forward coming into working in more

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:27.450
Caption: you&#39;re thinking about a career change

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.429
Caption: you know maybe there&#39;s something else

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:32.190
Caption: you should try and throw your throw your

00:11:29.429 --> 00:11:35.580
Caption: hand at a little piece of you is

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:38.130
Caption: beginning to die inside so I don&#39;t know

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:41.640
Caption: but is that familiar to anyone out there

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:43.440
Caption: I suspect it might be well there is an

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:50.489
Caption: alternative way there is a different way

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:52.710
Caption: to deliver software so is it important

00:11:50.489 --> 00:11:55.140
Caption: for people to really understand to be

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.520
Caption: invested in what they&#39;re doing do people

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.500
Caption: want to understand the role that they

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.929
Caption: play in the software they&#39;re building do

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.510
Caption: people want to be encouraged to get out

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:04.200
Caption: of bed and come to work with a smile or

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.710
Caption: yes

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.780
Caption: sure they do this matters very much and

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.520
Caption: the great organizations I&#39;ve worked in

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.560
Caption: have done this really well so what

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.630
Caption: they&#39;ve done is that they will explain

00:12:13.559 --> 00:12:17.489
Caption: the company strategy far and wide

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.840
Caption: they&#39;ll make sure they overly

00:12:17.489 --> 00:12:20.880
Caption: communicate that that everyone

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.770
Caption: understands all the way from the senior

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:28.380
Caption: level executives to the juniors of the

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:31.170
Caption: team so there&#39;s true alignment a good

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:33.960
Caption: way a good thing is also to be open and

00:12:31.169 --> 00:12:36.239
Caption: transparent with company results know

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:40.080
Caption: how things going in the market how are

00:12:36.239 --> 00:12:42.510
Caption: things developing and so forth and it&#39;s

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.130
Caption: also important to have one pages for

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.750
Caption: your team&#39;s and for your initiatives to

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:47.789
Caption: act as terms of reference you can give

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.530
Caption: these to new starters but also acts as

00:12:47.789 --> 00:12:52.139
Caption: reference points for the team later on

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.850
Caption: and I like to go and do a little straw

00:12:52.140 --> 00:13:01.109
Caption: poll to make sure everyone&#39;s still

00:12:53.849 --> 00:13:03.599
Caption: aligned now having a right environment

00:13:01.109 --> 00:13:06.179
Caption: where you can do the build measure learn

00:13:03.599 --> 00:13:08.609
Caption: how that mindset is crucial what you

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:11.549
Caption: want to avoid is having these fudge

00:13:08.609 --> 00:13:13.700
Caption: spreadsheets that only are given to

00:13:11.549 --> 00:13:15.839
Caption: middle management you want to have

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.150
Caption: analytics for everyone and this is how

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.900
Caption: the modern companies of today startups

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.940
Caption: and some of the larger enterprises

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:25.600
Caption: built from the ground up and this

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:27.880
Caption: enables teams to actually enact and see

00:13:25.599 --> 00:13:32.279
Caption: and measure the impact of what they&#39;re

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.280
Caption: doing and that&#39;s really important so

00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:43.809
Caption: self-organization so what you want to

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:45.489
Caption: have is ideally a team of leaders you

00:13:43.809 --> 00:13:47.859
Caption: want to have a safe environment where

00:13:45.489 --> 00:13:51.369
Caption: people can speak up give their ideas

00:13:47.859 --> 00:13:53.739
Caption: challenge each other now

00:13:51.369 --> 00:13:56.559
Caption: it takes time to get a team to this

00:13:53.739 --> 00:13:58.750
Caption: stage so I find you have to adjust your

00:13:56.559 --> 00:14:00.159
Caption: leadership style sometimes if less

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.080
Caption: mature teams you have to be more

00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:05.139
Caption: directive then you can move into your

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.940
Caption: coaching mode or supporting so it&#39;s

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.450
Caption: really important to have an awareness of

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:13.030
Caption: situational leadership there&#39;s also

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:14.980
Caption: quite a few team performance models that

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:17.650
Caption: are worth reading up so there&#39;s a Dexter

00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:20.169
Caption: and sibling pouncing ball the storming

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.550
Caption: norming forming and there&#39;s another one

00:14:20.169 --> 00:14:23.799
Caption: which I quite liked called the evolution

00:14:21.549 --> 00:14:25.239
Caption: of the dev team and the end state is

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:27.849
Caption: this team that they&#39;re like a wolf pack

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:31.719
Caption: which i think is a great analogy and I

00:14:27.849 --> 00:14:34.509
Caption: really love so with the team you want

00:14:31.719 --> 00:14:37.779
Caption: them to have ownership you want them to

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:39.970
Caption: own the plan and the target and also to

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:42.520
Caption: own the estimates that they&#39;re being

00:14:39.969 --> 00:14:45.129
Caption: held account to and this is what&#39;s truly

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:47.980
Caption: powerful this is what empowers a team

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:49.239
Caption: and leads to engagement if they&#39;re the

00:14:47.979 --> 00:14:53.619
Caption: ones that are masters of their own

00:14:49.239 --> 00:14:55.419
Caption: destiny now an effective team what does

00:14:53.619 --> 00:14:55.750
Caption: that feel like well it&#39;s a fun place to

00:14:55.419 --> 00:14:59.469
Caption: be

00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:03.130
Caption: you get done you have a voice you

00:14:59.469 --> 00:15:06.969
Caption: can speak up and you also are able to to

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:09.520
Caption: try new things there are three key

00:15:06.969 --> 00:15:11.319
Caption: things in terms of what drives people to

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:15.250
Caption: perform one is purpose which you&#39;ve

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:17.650
Caption: talked about before the other is mastery

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:20.169
Caption: so being able to try new things new

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:22.690
Caption: tools new practices and also autonomy so

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:27.909
Caption: that&#39;s laid out in in the famous book by

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:29.650
Caption: Dan pink drive a great and effective

00:15:27.909 --> 00:15:31.239
Caption: team we&#39;ll also have the respect of

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.790
Caption: those around them so that would be

00:15:31.239 --> 00:15:35.589
Caption: management and it&#39;ll also be other teams

00:15:33.789 --> 00:15:41.739
Caption: and they&#39;ll have the ability to all work

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:43.690
Caption: together and swarm around problems sorry

00:15:41.739 --> 00:15:47.640
Caption: the tricky part when things are not so

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:50.859
Caption: good it&#39;s really crucial to be honest

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.690
Caption: ask people questions don&#39;t assume

00:15:50.859 --> 00:15:56.019
Caption: because we all have things going on in

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:58.650
Caption: our personal lives so take the time if

00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:00.850
Caption: someone isn&#39;t performing set

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:02.290
Caption: expectations the worst thing you can do

00:16:00.849 --> 00:16:04.559
Caption: as a leader is just nod your head and

00:16:02.289 --> 00:16:07.359
Caption: say yeah that&#39;s okay that&#39;s really toxic

00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:10.239
Caption: so sit them down be clear what you&#39;re

00:16:07.359 --> 00:16:13.869
Caption: expecting from them and help them get

00:16:10.239 --> 00:16:17.169
Caption: there if someone is truly disruptive to

00:16:13.869 --> 00:16:20.440
Caption: your team then you have to let them go

00:16:17.169 --> 00:16:22.659
Caption: if they&#39;re not delivering one good way

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:24.609
Caption: to help improve this is to have team

00:16:22.659 --> 00:16:26.409
Caption: norms or you can call it work and

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:28.440
Caption: agreements or charters but it&#39;s really

00:16:26.409 --> 00:16:30.759
Caption: important that the team own these and

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.770
Caption: they&#39;re the ones that construct this and

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.359
Caption: the sign of a good team is when they&#39;ll

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:38.050
Caption: hold each other to account on their own

00:16:34.359 --> 00:16:40.649
Caption: and their own team norms obviously

00:16:38.049 --> 00:16:44.709
Caption: retrospectives are really important here

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:46.420
Caption: I really have got into some of the

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.160
Caption: health monitors of late as well so

00:16:46.419 --> 00:16:52.029
Caption: there&#39;s a great one there by alas Ian

00:16:48.159 --> 00:16:53.949
Caption: it&#39;s really easy to run and also it&#39;s a

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:56.560
Caption: great leading indicator as well because
