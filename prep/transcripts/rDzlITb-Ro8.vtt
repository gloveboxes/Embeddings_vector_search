WEBVTT

00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.669
Caption: so all the way from the USA sike and I

00:00:12.348 --> 00:00:17.579
Caption: all right thank you for that warm

00:00:14.638 --> 00:00:20.100
Caption: welcome my name is Jennifer Mars MIT and

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:22.948
Caption: during the next 45 minutes or so I want

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.960
Caption: to talk to you about AI perks and how we

00:00:22.948 --> 00:00:26.938
Caption: can use artificial intelligence machine

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:29.129
Caption: learning and data science to be able to

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:31.618
Caption: solve hard problems that are facing our

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:34.500
Caption: world today so let&#39;s start was just like

00:00:31.618 --> 00:00:36.599
Caption: two slides to talk about the s of grant

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.398
Caption: program and then I missed for the rest

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:41.488
Caption: of the time telling you about some

00:00:38.398 --> 00:00:43.589
Caption: amazing uses of technology and machine

00:00:41.488 --> 00:00:45.959
Caption: really specifically for how you can use

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.950
Caption: that to solve some really big challenges

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:53.669
Caption: that I was facing so let me just start

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.100
Caption: with the quick background on what gives

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:59.159
Caption: answer so why work on the as workers

00:00:56.099 --> 00:01:02.099
Caption: team at Microsoft and Anna for Earth is

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.539
Caption: a grant program so back in December of

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:05.188
Caption: 2017

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.849
Caption: Brad Smith who is the president of

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.770
Caption: Microsoft at a kind of change conference

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:13.169
Caption: in Paris made a big announcement that

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:15.329
Caption: Microsoft was publicly committing 50

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:17.819
Caption: million US dollars over a took on a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.040
Caption: five-year time frame to anyone doing

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.379
Caption: machine learning or data science work in

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.340
Caption: our four focus areas of agriculture

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:28.110
Caption: water climate change and biodiversity so

00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:29.309
Caption: you can be on the screen behind that

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.290
Caption: obviously repeating really big

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:33.059
Caption: challenges in that area being able to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.000
Caption: feed the world&#39;s growing population

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:38.099
Caption: that&#39;s rapidly approaching 10 billion

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.290
Caption: people on being able to provide clean

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:42.228
Caption: water to everyone and dealing almost

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.630
Caption: with the issues that was being around

00:01:42.228 --> 00:01:49.089
Caption: flooding and drought and sancho and then

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:51.578
Caption: climate change obviously a very big

00:01:49.089 --> 00:01:53.408
Caption: we&#39;re all following and then

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.899
Caption: biodiversity the fact that species are

00:01:53.408 --> 00:01:59.589
Caption: going extinct and arrays also sometimes

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.299
Caption: what they should be and so that is the

00:01:59.589 --> 00:02:04.538
Caption: great program and the reason I&#39;m telling

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.869
Caption: you this is because Australia you guys

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.669
Caption: you are like this hub of biodiversity I

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.069
Caption: know to spend yesterday a trotta&#39;s

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:14.199
Caption: island and only goodness the water which

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.738
Caption: is a vulnerable aspects of vulnerable

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:20.860
Caption: species is just this amazing little

00:02:16.738 --> 00:02:22.690
Caption: animal and so I would actually and of

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.639
Caption: course the Great Barrier Reef and all

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.309
Caption: this other stuff so you guys are just so

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:31.059
Caption: uniquely positioned to do amazing

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:34.059
Caption: research and work to healthier so if

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:36.130
Caption: anyone knows of people were using

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.899
Caption: machine learning data science who would

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.779
Caption: like to get in on some of this grant

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:43.149
Caption: money the worst thing is the kind of

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:44.470
Caption: money that goes suspect so I just know

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.089
Caption: anyone who&#39;s doing work in the space

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.708
Caption: apply for a grant get something for

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:53.679
Caption: frankly here wonderful what is with the

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:56.649
Caption: rest of the time talking about is of the

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:58.509
Caption: grant recipients that in our network

00:02:56.649 --> 00:03:01.029
Caption: that who have done some amazing things

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:03.129
Caption: using machine learning to solve these

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:05.289
Caption: really hard problems I&#39;m gonna try to be

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.850
Caption: really explicit about who did this work

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:09.250
Caption: I want to be really clear this is not

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.829
Caption: all of my work I&#39;m not taking credit for

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.569
Caption: this some of this is my person research

00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:15.518
Caption: some of this is some of her print

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.410
Caption: recipient outside with my yourself so

00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:19.798
Caption: I&#39;ll be really clear try to call out for

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.569
Caption: each of these stories who is doing what

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:24.160
Caption: the first one I want to talk about is a

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.720
Caption: project called project premonition

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.238
Caption: anybody heard of that already cut record

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.130
Caption: initial couple people&#39;s so project

00:03:28.238 --> 00:03:32.768
Caption: premonition is something that was came

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:37.299
Caption: out of Microsoft Research and the idea

00:03:32.768 --> 00:03:39.940
Caption: behind it is how we stop outbreaks of

00:03:37.298 --> 00:03:42.069
Caption: disease before they happen so you guys

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.238
Caption: remember the Zika virus incident right

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:48.789
Caption: and then we kind of what&#39;s Nile disease

00:03:45.238 --> 00:03:51.729
Caption: that&#39;s how Wolford

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:53.769
Caption: avian flu I suppose have these really

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:56.919
Caption: big infectious diseases that and create

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.320
Caption: these big public scares and so the

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:01.270
Caption: research madness whatever we did ahead

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.300
Caption: of those and predicted before they come

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.240
Caption: and so the idea they came up with is

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.680
Caption: what if we leverage little data

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.440
Caption: collectors that are out in the

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:15.419
Caption: environment already collecting random

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.399
Caption: blood samples and those are mosquitoes

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:21.040
Caption: right they&#39;re already taking blood

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:24.009
Caption: samples from humans from animals that

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.940
Caption: these diseases are coming from and if we

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.830
Caption: have if we&#39;re able to capture a mosquito

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.290
Caption: that&#39;s consumed a blood meal we can

00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:35.139
Caption: actually use our genomics pipeline to

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.970
Caption: reverse-engineer from the DNA of that

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.220
Caption: flood and be able to tell what host

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.929
Caption: animal that died on and what diseases

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.779
Caption: they carry so that&#39;s we&#39;re gonna talk

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:45.779
Caption: about first

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:49.269
Caption: alright so this is actually just exact

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:51.040
Caption: 75% of these infectious diseases so that

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:53.289
Caption: how beautifully like those things that

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.770
Caption: you hear about Zika do originate in ear

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.270
Caption: holes

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:57.849
Caption: so they started animals are so then they

00:04:55.269 --> 00:05:01.179
Caption: sprites and humans just 75% so a fairly

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.700
Caption: significant so we can catch those either

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:06.009
Caption: stolen animals before they kind of form

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.020
Caption: outbreaks that&#39;s a really good thing and

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.240
Caption: so I already kind of mentioned exactly

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:12.160
Caption: the process but these needles were going

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:15.309
Caption: around biting animals and we can collect

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.839
Caption: them or attach to them that we can make

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:19.359
Caption: a difference to be able to actually grab

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:26.199
Caption: that one to be able to be awareness

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:29.019
Caption: there&#39;s so there&#39;s really two okay so

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.650
Caption: the way this is actually dying is two

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:31.119
Caption: keys

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:33.880
Caption: research I want to talk about each of

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:36.910
Caption: those so one of them is an intelligent

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.029
Caption: track so I&#39;ll show you a picture in just

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.750
Caption: a second we have a smart tracks and it

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:45.910
Caption: can just collect you can it has a little

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.459
Caption: classifier too many classifier on the

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.899
Caption: device so it will only capture the

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:52.239
Caption: insects that we care about so we&#39;ll talk

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:55.239
Caption: about that in just a second it&#39;s

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:57.819
Caption: essentially a cylinder that&#39;s about that

00:05:55.239 --> 00:06:00.309
Caption: maybe this wide around and it&#39;s got a

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.740
Caption: little little hole in the center and

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:04.690
Caption: then you can stick a lure in the hole

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:07.349
Caption: and because everything is a couple of

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.699
Caption: different types of lures we&#39;ve used

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.979
Caption: light because insects return to the

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:14.529
Caption: light co2 because we exhale carbon

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.419
Caption: dioxide and insects love to are

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:19.119
Caption: attracted right to that only see some

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.369
Caption: sense of rightness of things and then

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:24.190
Caption: there&#39;s actually an hour on the outside

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:25.630
Caption: of 64 individual little cells and each

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.910
Caption: one of them have its it&#39;s a little

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.220
Caption: trapdoor and so what happens is an

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.559
Caption: insect can fly in check out the lure and

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.179
Caption: then fly away and within seven

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:36.459
Caption: milliseconds it will actually make a

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:38.679
Caption: decision of is this the kind of insects

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:41.489
Caption: we want to trap and then if it is we

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:43.539
Caption: will close that door and catch it and

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:45.489
Caption: it&#39;s actually really interesting I

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:47.799
Caption: didn&#39;t know predators work but the

00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:49.479
Caption: treatment use you know that carries West

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:50.888
Caption: Nile does actually different than this

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.869
Caption: you know that carry Zika virus

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.479
Caption: so Zika virus is carried by a mosquito

00:06:52.869 --> 00:07:00.098
Caption: called by the species ABC chip diet and

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:02.500
Caption: then on the West Nile is actually by the

00:07:00.098 --> 00:07:04.869
Caption: Jewish Jesus so we can actually

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.540
Caption: differentiate between those two skills

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:07.820
Caption: like nine

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.740
Caption: as an actress so it&#39;s very very very

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.570
Caption: good so you can track just what you want

00:07:09.739 --> 00:07:14.269
Caption: we move on test-fitting the riotous

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.130
Caption: things and that there&#39;s an accuracy

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:17.599
Caption: right there so let&#39;s dive into this to

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:21.679
Caption: research controversial so the first of

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:24.679
Caption: the smart tracker and a little look at

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:26.299
Caption: that left-hand side so you can see and

00:07:24.679 --> 00:07:27.979
Caption: that could in lights as a lure in the

00:07:26.299 --> 00:07:30.619
Caption: middle you can see attempt looks like a

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.760
Caption: circular apartment building almost where

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:33.139
Caption: there&#39;s all the little individual

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.690
Caption: windows and each one of those has a

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.610
Caption: little trapdoor and then once the trap

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.899
Caption: door closes it doesn&#39;t kill the insect

00:07:37.609 --> 00:07:42.619
Caption: or anything they&#39;re just trapped in

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:44.660
Caption: there and so it&#39;s it&#39;s in there and were

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:47.570
Caption: able to capture it and be able to then

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.670
Caption: use it to study about what edit area so

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.250
Caption: very great it&#39;s worth specifically blood

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.320
Caption: feeding enzymes the second key

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.600
Caption: contribution of this work is once you

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.279
Caption: have the skills you need to be able to

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.869
Caption: actually drive interesting information

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:03.889
Caption: with them and so that&#39;s where our

00:07:59.869 --> 00:08:05.809
Caption: metagenomics pipeline comes in so we can

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:09.020
Caption: utilize that blood meal that was

00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:10.160
Caption: consumed take that concentrated DNA and

00:08:09.019 --> 00:08:12.559
Caption: be able to run that through a DNA

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.440
Caption: sequencer and then be able to tell what

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:17.660
Caption: the host animal that fed off of as well

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.299
Caption: as diseases that were carried and to

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.660
Caption: what was interesting how we can get down

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:22.659
Caption: to that level

00:08:23.799 --> 00:08:29.839
Caption: thanks buddy you&#39;re perfect go on and

00:08:28.549 --> 00:08:32.510
Caption: eat it too engine on you this is

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:35.690
Caption: something that activist was so pretty we

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:38.479
Caption: can&#39;t manage what we can&#39;t measure right

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.309
Caption: and what is so crazy to me about this

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:44.419
Caption: whole thing since I started diving into

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:46.250
Caption: this research what is that we know how

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:46.519
Caption: with the species that are on earth right

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.890
Caption: now

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.350
Caption: Randy and so if we&#39;re trying to manage

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:53.239
Caption: like this biodiversity and these species

00:08:51.349 --> 00:08:55.039
Caption: going extinct like how could we think

00:08:53.239 --> 00:08:56.619
Caption: about you know with engineers this is

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:58.029
Caption: driving you crazy

00:08:56.619 --> 00:09:00.820
Caption: that&#39;s that you even have a good

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.500
Caption: catalogue what exists now like how are

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.059
Caption: we supposed to track that well that&#39;s

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.739
Caption: one that really makes me crazy if you

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:10.529
Caption: look at the numbers up here dress my

00:09:05.739 --> 00:09:10.529
Caption: word grace so those are land-dwelling

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:14.559
Caption: tresco art supplies those are such a big

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.970
Caption: bug there&#39;s an S can attend to the six

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:18.130
Caption: species but we really took all of them

00:09:15.969 --> 00:09:20.109
Caption: and the bacteria knows there&#39;s an

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.950
Caption: estimated tens of the six to ten to the

00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:24.309
Caption: die

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:26.410
Caption: species of bacteria viruses and if I

00:09:24.309 --> 00:09:27.909
Caption: explain narrow that down to just viruses

00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:29.769
Caption: per second you guys know how many named

00:09:27.909 --> 00:09:36.819
Caption: virus is actually exist right now

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:41.320
Caption: viruses are things 4,500 insane will

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:43.150
Caption: have mates with 4,500 viruses so it&#39;s

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.479
Caption: just there&#39;s so much to learn there&#39;s so

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:48.369
Caption: much that we can do here okay so here is

00:09:46.479 --> 00:09:50.979
Caption: a look this is using its the right

00:09:48.369 --> 00:09:52.839
Caption: camera so it shows you the the little

00:09:50.979 --> 00:09:57.669
Caption: traffic actress if you watch that Center

00:09:52.840 --> 00:10:00.270
Caption: cell right there so just keep watching

00:09:57.669 --> 00:10:02.440
Caption: that Center self units day but it&#39;ll

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.970
Caption: insect there&#39;s a lure in the middle that

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.460
Caption: since we&#39;re kind of hoping around and

00:10:03.969 --> 00:10:08.559
Caption: then I&#39;ve actually come to the sever one

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:12.160
Caption: there is there is and it closed you see

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:13.840
Caption: so that&#39;s exactly how it works is it

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:18.479
Caption: goes in it was actually happening there

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.480
Caption: under the covers is that there&#39;s a small

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.799
Caption: LED beam right there and then add it

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.800
Caption: passes through it&#39;s basically taking

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:29.019
Caption: time series data of imagine are like

00:10:26.799 --> 00:10:31.029
Caption: have us a single pixel light beam

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.220
Caption: tightness and so that as it moves

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.330
Caption: through its gathering that data so it

00:10:33.219 --> 00:10:36.969
Caption: can sense almost like

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.160
Caption: ladies is what it&#39;s it&#39;s measuring there

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:40.989
Caption: so as things go in we can use that data

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:43.089
Caption: that time series data that&#39;s cooking off

00:10:40.989 --> 00:10:45.969
Caption: of that that little sensor to be able to

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.200
Caption: tell what kind of executives and then

00:10:45.969 --> 00:10:49.089
Caption: the other thing that&#39;s kind of cool

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.179
Caption: about this is because they are trapped

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:56.080
Caption: and you can use this you could utilize

00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:57.339
Caption: that in there that&#39;s an example of one

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.880
Caption: of the mosquitoes that was actually

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:02.800
Caption: caught using on this trap in Houston

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.929
Caption: Texas in one of our field sites with

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:09.190
Caption: Houston was had under the gazebo

00:11:04.929 --> 00:11:11.200
Caption: concerns and if you are an entomologist

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.970
Caption: and if you study bugs would be so

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.520
Caption: excited about that because that mosquito

00:11:12.969 --> 00:11:17.079
Caption: is it like pristine condition right the

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.239
Caption: state of your bug traps they are right

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.970
Caption: now use actually both super to use like

00:11:19.239 --> 00:11:23.500
Caption: suction or fans so a lot of times by the

00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:25.959
Caption: time the book gets through the section

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.309
Caption: of sand it&#39;s all like crazy looking it&#39;s

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.800
Caption: good it&#39;s not going to makes a good

00:11:27.309 --> 00:11:32.229
Caption: sample and so right you&#39;re all those

00:11:29.799 --> 00:11:34.959
Caption: little group it traps it so you have

00:11:32.229 --> 00:11:37.449
Caption: this nice not they simple to use so very

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.790
Caption: very cool stuff here all right

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:42.340
Caption: um the main point I want to make on this

00:11:39.789 --> 00:11:44.349
Caption: slide is the fact that this is a really

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:48.850
Caption: great example of using machine learning

00:11:44.349 --> 00:11:51.130
Caption: on edge we obviously are mosquitoes

00:11:48.849 --> 00:11:53.889
Caption: aren&#39;t as great as your quads that will

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.809
Caption: close for selfies in a wonderful way but

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.940
Caption: misuse our just like they&#39;re in they&#39;re

00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:58.630
Caption: out there in big overly care and if

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.580
Caption: you&#39;re like so

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.440
Caption: up to the cloud waiting for response and

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.480
Caption: all that or you may or may not have

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:08.549
Caption: network connectivity you can tell this

00:12:04.479 --> 00:12:10.599
Caption: is actually a really remote area and um

00:12:08.549 --> 00:12:11.769
Caption: it&#39;s really weird you could tell think

00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:14.139
Caption: you have cell phone coverage that the

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:16.600
Caption: woman isn&#39;t talking on her cell phone so

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.130
Caption: you have some footage with the Wi-Fi

00:12:16.599 --> 00:12:19.419
Caption: it&#39;s a little sketchy whew this is a

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.820
Caption: pretty remote village which is only

00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:25.329
Caption: actually accessible by boat oh wait on

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:27.489
Caption: our to sit there and so you can get a

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.020
Caption: sense for this is a minute really looks

00:12:27.489 --> 00:12:30.789
Caption: better when you don&#39;t have to depend on

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:34.660
Caption: an internet and just stick it somewhere

00:12:30.789 --> 00:12:37.059
Caption: and then be able to utilize the machine

00:12:34.659 --> 00:12:39.429
Caption: learning right on the device so it is

00:12:37.059 --> 00:12:41.260
Caption: all that ml is happening right on device

00:12:39.429 --> 00:12:43.630
Caption: and it does happen within seven

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.520
Caption: milliseconds the other one I get is just

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.349
Caption: the relative size you could kind of see

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.450
Caption: what it looks like right there it&#39;s not

00:12:47.349 --> 00:12:50.859
Caption: about 200 tripods so you can see it

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:55.000
Caption: there right in the context of the

00:12:50.859 --> 00:12:56.559
Caption: village and all right so let&#39;s talk a

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.049
Caption: little bit more about the data that were

00:12:56.559 --> 00:13:02.619
Caption: collecting here so I have three little

00:12:59.049 --> 00:13:04.269
Caption: friends that reflected right here and I

00:13:02.619 --> 00:13:06.400
Caption: already mentioned I was an accuracy of

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:09.580
Caption: about a three percent accuracy at

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:13.660
Caption: separating West Nile mosquitoes from the

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:16.480
Caption: zero speedos and these particular guys

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:18.669
Caption: the one on the left is by taxi flight

00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:20.889
Caption: and they are known to carry African

00:13:18.669 --> 00:13:23.619
Caption: sleeping sickness the middle guy is

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:26.290
Caption: scared you know who is a violent eater

00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:29.380
Caption: as well as an agricultural cast and then

00:13:26.289 --> 00:13:32.559
Caption: the guy on the right very rare breed of

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:35.410
Caption: mosquito that we actually found doing

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:37.059
Caption: work with on Jake got off of work that

00:13:35.409 --> 00:13:38.739
Caption: she does with eat all day with the chips

00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:41.349
Caption: this is one of the guy there&#39;s feeding

00:13:38.739 --> 00:13:42.880
Caption: opportunity and there so a lot of a lot

00:13:41.349 --> 00:13:44.769
Caption: of Google information and if you take a

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.169
Caption: look at these each of these charts so

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:49.000
Caption: the first turn that exceed the that&#39;s

00:13:47.169 --> 00:13:51.820
Caption: the time series data that&#39;s coming

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.739
Caption: that little LED so as they fly into and

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.090
Caption: check out the more like I can see the

00:13:53.739 --> 00:13:57.159
Caption: different tribesmen you can see they

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.170
Caption: each one of those looks distinct so

00:13:57.159 --> 00:14:01.839
Caption: essentially different maybe patterns and

00:13:59.169 --> 00:14:03.279
Caption: how they slide creates a different data

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.170
Caption: signature that allows us to

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.480
Caption: differentiate between these insects and

00:14:05.169 --> 00:14:09.880
Caption: then the chart below that is actually

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:12.369
Caption: the same thing of that that same kind of

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.780
Caption: beam deep data only incentive in the

00:14:12.369 --> 00:14:16.119
Caption: trying to mean it&#39;s in the frequency

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:21.070
Caption: domain so it&#39;s just an FFT of the data

00:14:16.119 --> 00:14:23.739
Caption: bucket and then the little dots there to

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:26.530
Caption: show you which of the 64 cells it flew

00:14:23.739 --> 00:14:28.630
Caption: into if it&#39;s that matters and then

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.610
Caption: there&#39;s a whole bunch of other data that

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.739
Caption: is listed below which is other stuff

00:14:30.609 --> 00:14:34.929
Caption: that we collect every time an insect

00:14:32.739 --> 00:14:36.429
Caption: rose so essentially every time an insect

00:14:34.929 --> 00:14:38.320
Caption: flies and flies out even if we don&#39;t

00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:40.390
Caption: catch it we can collect a bunch of data

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.100
Caption: about encounter so we might even just

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.330
Caption: choose to say like baby duck is it&#39;s

00:14:42.099 --> 00:14:44.679
Caption: something like something that&#39;s not a

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.080
Caption: bloodsucker where it&#39;s like useful to

00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:49.450
Caption: catch it and obviously what you can also

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.670
Caption: just monitor the insect population in an

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:54.369
Caption: area and see what kind of insects are

00:14:51.669 --> 00:14:57.369
Caption: our present and such and then adds it

00:14:54.369 --> 00:14:59.529
Caption: and these Pro happens it captures things

00:14:57.369 --> 00:15:01.500
Caption: like lettuce you thought it to you or

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:04.120
Caption: that if they want to do at the time a

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:07.960
Caption: whole bunch of weather take elements so

00:15:04.119 --> 00:15:09.070
Caption: very much pressure light wind other

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.600
Caption: things you can better provide the

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.859
Caption: sensors on there and have it just

00:15:10.599 --> 00:15:13.209
Caption: capture all that data

00:15:11.859 --> 00:15:15.130
Caption: and so that actually gives us a lot of

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:17.230
Caption: good information about kind of the

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:20.849
Caption: presence of what these insects when

00:15:17.229 --> 00:15:20.849
Caption: they&#39;re most active that sort of thing

00:15:21.239 --> 00:15:27.138
Caption: so this is actual data that we took that

00:15:24.429 --> 00:15:29.688
Caption: was useful from the fund infusions

00:15:27.138 --> 00:15:32.118
Caption: he actually had a honey Houston during

00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:33.949
Caption: the secon traders and what&#39;s kind of

00:15:32.119 --> 00:15:36.949
Caption: interesting about this is this is charts

00:15:33.948 --> 00:15:39.979
Caption: that show for two three IDs in mosquito

00:15:36.948 --> 00:15:41.958
Caption: so the one in the turquoise is the ABC

00:15:39.979 --> 00:15:43.909
Caption: chip die so that&#39;s their thirty bucks

00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:45.828
Caption: and then the one in the orangish is a

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:47.659
Caption: Hewlett&#39;s miss you know which is the one

00:15:45.828 --> 00:15:48.948
Caption: that carries West Nile and so people

00:15:47.659 --> 00:15:52.039
Caption: have all kinds of questions about like

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:54.078
Caption: in which would be you know everyone was

00:15:52.039 --> 00:15:55.958
Caption: many bucks crazy crazy at that point but

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:58.758
Caption: like what was interesting it in the

00:15:55.958 --> 00:16:00.229
Caption: Harris County the Department of Public

00:15:58.758 --> 00:16:02.628
Caption: Health actually worked really closely

00:16:00.229 --> 00:16:04.578
Caption: with us on this and they were amazing to

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:07.069
Caption: work with but this actually was able to

00:16:04.578 --> 00:16:10.128
Caption: give them like the most precise like

00:16:07.068 --> 00:16:11.838
Caption: down to the minute look how these was

00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:13.669
Caption: usable behaving because I think they&#39;re

00:16:11.838 --> 00:16:15.739
Caption: you know prior to that everything like

00:16:13.669 --> 00:16:17.660
Caption: some general advice released about like

00:16:15.739 --> 00:16:19.309
Caption: oh the mosquitoes are most active at

00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:20.868
Caption: this time of day you know Dave versus

00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:23.179
Caption: magnet evening ones versus the morning

00:16:20.869 --> 00:16:25.399
Caption: ones but with this data we actually got

00:16:23.179 --> 00:16:27.350
Caption: a minute-by-minute who is kind of what

00:16:25.398 --> 00:16:28.938
Caption: these behaviors look like you can see

00:16:27.349 --> 00:16:31.909
Caption: some interesting things if you look at

00:16:28.939 --> 00:16:34.189
Caption: this one in particular you can see that

00:16:31.909 --> 00:16:35.688
Caption: it doesn&#39;t affect that she looks with

00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:37.160
Caption: either that much of that that&#39;s that

00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:39.559
Caption: particular one is tracking barometric

00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:41.479
Caption: pressure and you can see absolutely no

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:43.489
Caption: effect Felix is kind of does not care

00:16:41.479 --> 00:16:47.328
Caption: about their interpreter but there&#39;s a

00:16:43.489 --> 00:16:50.749
Caption: huge it very much is affecting behavior

00:16:47.328 --> 00:16:52.758
Caption: and how active how many how many of

00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:54.769
Caption: Egypt dynasties were out there and those

00:16:52.758 --> 00:16:56.808
Caption: with the Zika carriers and so with that

00:16:54.768 --> 00:16:58.398
Caption: data we can actually go and public

00:16:56.809 --> 00:17:00.019
Caption: health officials could spray in the best

00:16:58.398 --> 00:17:00.578
Caption: times to make sure that they were

00:17:00.018 --> 00:17:02.289
Caption: killing

00:17:00.578 --> 00:17:06.390
Caption: most accurately those in a time when

00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:09.250
Caption: they were at the right place all right

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:11.558
Caption: okay so that&#39;s kind of the physicals

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.010
Caption: track all the cool stuff that we can do

00:17:11.558 --> 00:17:14.109
Caption: there

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:16.088
Caption: however it&#39;s some point you need to get

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:17.739
Caption: beyond the physical characteristics as

00:17:16.088 --> 00:17:19.958
Caption: you know and kids out to the genomics

00:17:17.739 --> 00:17:22.328
Caption: level to be able to understand what

00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:23.769
Caption: exactly is happening in what animal you

00:17:22.328 --> 00:17:27.219
Caption: know what diseases are actually

00:17:23.769 --> 00:17:29.140
Caption: happening here and so what we do is we

00:17:27.219 --> 00:17:31.178
Caption: take the mosquitoes that are caught in

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.919
Caption: the traps and because you have so bloody

00:17:31.178 --> 00:17:34.449
Caption: mosquitoes over there and essentially

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:37.768
Caption: turn them into mosquito juice

00:17:34.449 --> 00:17:42.189
Caption: so they are very concentrated in the DNA

00:17:37.769 --> 00:17:44.739
Caption: of the mosquito and then what we&#39;re

00:17:42.189 --> 00:17:46.538
Caption: trying to do as fast as possible is take

00:17:44.739 --> 00:17:48.369
Caption: that DNA sample so that comes out of

00:17:46.538 --> 00:17:50.829
Caption: them and put it into a gene sequencer

00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:52.779
Caption: and then basically were mask matching it

00:17:50.829 --> 00:17:55.000
Caption: against this huge you know public

00:17:52.779 --> 00:17:57.909
Caption: database of all partial a sequence life

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.159
Caption: forms in the Tree of Life which is crazy

00:17:57.909 --> 00:18:01.389
Caption: as fast as possible we&#39;re trying to come

00:18:00.159 --> 00:18:04.179
Caption: up with an output that looks something

00:18:01.389 --> 00:18:06.130
Caption: like this so a computed recipe of you

00:18:04.178 --> 00:18:08.469
Caption: know what is this DNA profile and it&#39;s

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:15.219
Caption: going to be so mix of here&#39;s like what

00:18:08.469 --> 00:18:17.500
Caption: example 90% egypt i which is the

00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:20.199
Caption: mosquito around this room was about five

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.329
Caption: percent Homo sapiens of five percent

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:24.579
Caption: didn&#39;t even before it was capture and

00:18:22.329 --> 00:18:27.579
Caption: they finally very small perfect was this

00:18:24.579 --> 00:18:31.630
Caption: novel rabid virus before you panicked

00:18:27.579 --> 00:18:33.638
Caption: remember only 4500 viruses have names so

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.409
Caption: it doesn&#39;t in calculators discover

00:18:33.639 --> 00:18:37.600
Caption: that&#39;s actually not that scary it&#39;s just

00:18:35.409 --> 00:18:38.960
Caption: done okay and February sections to the

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:42.859
Caption: babies day okay

00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:44.089
Caption: was carrying something akin to rabies so

00:18:42.859 --> 00:18:46.189
Caption: that&#39;s what we think was right so

00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:48.169
Caption: basically it&#39;s kind of a hard thing

00:18:46.189 --> 00:18:50.659
Caption: right it&#39;s almost like imagine that you

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:52.369
Caption: can walk to the to the bar or a pump or

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:55.070
Caption: a tavern or whatever you say here and

00:18:52.369 --> 00:18:58.400
Caption: you can be really tasty drink with your

00:18:55.069 --> 00:18:59.869
Caption: friends right and you&#39;re like this is

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.640
Caption: really good because you don&#39;t know any

00:18:59.869 --> 00:19:03.979
Caption: of the dancers drink things because you

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:06.589
Caption: spent university and the library like a

00:19:03.979 --> 00:19:08.719
Caption: good girl like a stimulus is pretty good

00:19:06.589 --> 00:19:12.709
Caption: I&#39;m gonna make it work juice and then is

00:19:08.719 --> 00:19:13.579
Caption: that you&#39;re trying to deconstruct that

00:19:12.709 --> 00:19:14.989
Caption: as fast as I can

00:19:13.579 --> 00:19:16.699
Caption: essentially that&#39;s what our Secret

00:19:14.989 --> 00:19:18.140
Caption: Service doing is trying to given this

00:19:16.699 --> 00:19:20.539
Caption: what are the little ingredients that

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.400
Caption: made them we do that as fast as possible

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.710
Caption: it what makes it possible to do that so

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.979
Caption: quickly it&#39;s you take on the over the

00:19:24.709 --> 00:19:29.449
Caption: cold snap and this was developed in

00:19:27.979 --> 00:19:31.849
Caption: conjunction between Microsoft Research

00:19:29.449 --> 00:19:34.909
Caption: and UC Berkeley University of California

00:19:31.849 --> 00:19:36.949
Caption: Berkeley and it is a free algorithm that

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:39.650
Caption: allows you to come to like this much

00:19:36.949 --> 00:19:43.369
Caption: faster and using some they don&#39;t and it

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:44.839
Caption: does take things but essentially we are

00:19:43.369 --> 00:19:46.040
Caption: able to run this and these numbers are

00:19:44.839 --> 00:19:48.619
Caption: even better than this but essentially

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.750
Caption: something is complex as a genome there

00:19:48.619 --> 00:19:53.780
Caption: this that&#39;s a very big big data problem

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:55.400
Caption: and so perfect for cloud right exactly

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.260
Caption: the kind of thing you want to toddler so

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.630
Caption: you can throw that analysis of an azure

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:02.449
Caption: we give them to run around like 250

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:04.400
Caption: notes or more or less and then we do it

00:20:02.449 --> 00:20:06.349
Caption: idiots respond within a couple of hours

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.849
Caption: and so this was really really cool

00:20:06.349 --> 00:20:09.559
Caption: because with the cloud airship took a

00:20:07.849 --> 00:20:10.439
Caption: process that used to take used to take

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.210
Caption: like 30 days

00:20:10.439 --> 00:20:13.739
Caption: something to sequence like one thing and

00:20:12.209 --> 00:20:16.138
Caption: now we&#39;ve got that down to like a matter

00:20:13.739 --> 00:20:19.079
Caption: of hours so it&#39;s really really exciting

00:20:16.139 --> 00:20:20.489
Caption: to see what could be done and then some

00:20:19.079 --> 00:20:22.949
Caption: machine learning that&#39;s happening here

00:20:20.489 --> 00:20:25.788
Caption: absolutely using Bayesian mixture models

00:20:22.949 --> 00:20:28.378
Caption: and so what that does is you couldn&#39;t

00:20:25.788 --> 00:20:30.359
Caption: see this okay but essentially there&#39;s a

00:20:28.379 --> 00:20:32.729
Caption: cup there&#39;s a lot of similarities in the

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:35.398
Caption: Tree of Life all right so imagine like a

00:20:32.729 --> 00:20:37.288
Caption: rat and a box oh how does the DNA is

00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:39.509
Caption: very very similar than some of it is

00:20:37.288 --> 00:20:42.569
Caption: different and so what this does is these

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:44.489
Caption: niche models allow you to be able to

00:20:42.569 --> 00:20:45.658
Caption: essentially boost the signal of the

00:20:44.489 --> 00:20:47.609
Caption: correct thing by looking it

00:20:45.659 --> 00:20:49.740
Caption: probabilistically what&#39;s more likely and

00:20:47.609 --> 00:20:52.109
Caption: that kind of dampens the signal of of

00:20:49.739 --> 00:20:54.239
Caption: the things that aren&#39;t correct so helps

00:20:52.109 --> 00:20:55.979
Caption: you be more effective there and you can

00:20:54.239 --> 00:20:57.778
Caption: see how can you measure this probably

00:20:55.979 --> 00:21:00.449
Caption: your next question right so we have a

00:20:57.779 --> 00:21:04.110
Caption: couple things right here so if we up to

00:21:00.449 --> 00:21:05.819
Caption: a complete synthetic test we can achieve

00:21:04.109 --> 00:21:09.239
Caption: 90 like right now my accuracy so what

00:21:05.819 --> 00:21:12.508
Caption: that means is we take so like here

00:21:09.239 --> 00:21:15.989
Caption: Sestito DNA and randomly sample from

00:21:12.509 --> 00:21:17.580
Caption: those genomes and then we take so some

00:21:15.989 --> 00:21:19.259
Caption: host animal or human or whatever and

00:21:17.579 --> 00:21:22.258
Caption: randomly sample some of that and then

00:21:19.259 --> 00:21:24.330
Caption: randomly sampled from a some viruses and

00:21:22.259 --> 00:21:26.609
Caption: mix that all together and throw it there

00:21:24.329 --> 00:21:28.648
Caption: they can predict with 99.9% accuracy

00:21:26.609 --> 00:21:31.469
Caption: count us and then if we could same thing

00:21:28.649 --> 00:21:34.019
Caption: only in second life we incorporate not

00:21:31.469 --> 00:21:35.788
Caption: all viruses so we take some places to

00:21:34.019 --> 00:21:37.080
Caption: these unnamed ones in it okay here

00:21:35.788 --> 00:21:39.298
Caption: something looks a little different how

00:21:37.079 --> 00:21:40.739
Caption: well it did not do precise of a train on

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:42.808
Caption: that type of data and we still get

00:21:40.739 --> 00:21:45.538
Caption: around 97% accuracy for that one and

00:21:42.808 --> 00:21:47.459
Caption: then finally we do actual lab tasks as

00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:48.579
Caption: well or means eveness you know real

00:21:47.459 --> 00:21:50.589
Caption: blood

00:21:48.579 --> 00:21:52.479
Caption: the real process knowing what that data

00:21:50.589 --> 00:21:55.719
Caption: is and you can see chapters in there is

00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:57.428
Caption: good as well alright so if you would

00:21:55.719 --> 00:21:59.199
Caption: like any more information about this you

00:21:57.428 --> 00:22:00.939
Caption: can feel free to check out the Microsoft

00:21:59.199 --> 00:22:02.768
Caption: research page that is the lead

00:22:00.939 --> 00:22:05.528
Caption: researcher even Jack steps right there

00:22:02.769 --> 00:22:09.630
Caption: and it&#39;s Microsoft that comments like

00:22:05.529 --> 00:22:11.919
Caption: premonition so that story number one

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:13.750
Caption: next let&#39;s talk about something called

00:22:11.918 --> 00:22:15.969
Caption: farming meat sitting in their farm eats

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:24.089
Caption: this is an open microsoft research in

00:22:15.969 --> 00:22:27.250
Caption: agriculture space all right so today is

00:22:24.089 --> 00:22:29.109
Caption: how can we help enable it and feed the

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:32.380
Caption: world&#39;s growing population so in the end

00:22:29.109 --> 00:22:33.969
Caption: of the United Nations in 2009 it was

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:36.609
Caption: actually stated that we need to double

00:22:33.969 --> 00:22:38.079
Caption: our current rate of production if we&#39;re

00:22:36.609 --> 00:22:39.579
Caption: going to be able to keep up with the

00:22:38.079 --> 00:22:41.589
Caption: tomato so it&#39;s kind of the growing

00:22:39.579 --> 00:22:43.599
Caption: population so we used to the right 2016

00:22:41.589 --> 00:22:47.079
Caption: 8 2015 3 to double our current food

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:48.609
Caption: production rate and so how do we do not

00:22:47.079 --> 00:22:51.518
Caption: like who could we use technology to

00:22:48.609 --> 00:22:53.709
Caption: enable farmers and coastal health with

00:22:51.519 --> 00:22:55.809
Caption: more data to the farming and so that was

00:22:53.709 --> 00:22:57.069
Caption: the intent behind our peas and the

00:22:55.808 --> 00:22:58.479
Caption: principal research runs are so they get

00:22:57.069 --> 00:23:00.339
Caption: this is another Microsoft Research one

00:22:58.479 --> 00:23:02.288
Caption: and the principal research on this one

00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:03.788
Caption: is a gentleman named Randhir Chandra and

00:23:02.288 --> 00:23:05.888
Caption: so when I joined the anti-terrorist team

00:23:03.788 --> 00:23:07.329
Caption: I was you know really excited about this

00:23:05.889 --> 00:23:10.619
Caption: one they&#39;re talking around here about it

00:23:07.329 --> 00:23:13.028
Caption: and asking a ton of questions and the

00:23:10.619 --> 00:23:15.069
Caption: really what they&#39;re trying to enable

00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:15.850
Caption: some legal precision agriculture and so

00:23:15.069 --> 00:23:18.069
Caption: if you&#39;re not familiar position

00:23:15.849 --> 00:23:19.569
Caption: agriculture ok I think that is so

00:23:18.069 --> 00:23:21.278
Caption: precision agriculture is the become for

00:23:19.569 --> 00:23:23.168
Caption: a long time and within if there&#39;s a lot

00:23:21.279 --> 00:23:24.119
Caption: of things like decision irrigation on

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:27.579
Caption: precision

00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:29.619
Caption: pesticides decision you know light

00:23:27.579 --> 00:23:32.489
Caption: distribution to the amount of each

00:23:29.619 --> 00:23:35.048
Caption: levels all those kind of things and so

00:23:32.489 --> 00:23:36.428
Caption: what that means is instead of the same

00:23:35.048 --> 00:23:37.510
Caption: precision irrigation because of the

00:23:36.428 --> 00:23:39.309
Caption: principle example

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:42.310
Caption: instead of homogeneously water in a

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:44.800
Caption: field with big sprinklers like usually

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:47.130
Caption: done today I said it&#39;s giving as refer

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:50.830
Caption: to feel the exact same amount of water

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:52.329
Caption: instead only water the amounts the field

00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:53.919
Caption: that really needs it right because this

00:23:52.329 --> 00:23:55.929
Caption: little dating people tips in the land

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.030
Caption: and water runs down on it and they do

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.890
Caption: disperse water more than this part so

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:02.020
Caption: you can actually use that to be able to

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:03.369
Caption: save it in reducing conserve the amounts

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.589
Caption: of water and the transportation of the

00:24:03.369 --> 00:24:06.790
Caption: water called that the other thing

00:24:05.589 --> 00:24:08.319
Caption: although I like the thought that my

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:11.440
Caption: sleep I&#39;d like the precision agriculture

00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:13.269
Caption: wanna get some precision pesticides you

00:24:11.439 --> 00:24:15.849
Caption: guys cuz that&#39;s like a win-win all the

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:17.739
Caption: way around because the pesticides are

00:24:15.849 --> 00:24:19.599
Caption: great for the environment they&#39;re not

00:24:17.739 --> 00:24:21.550
Caption: great for us we&#39;re eating the food and

00:24:19.599 --> 00:24:23.469
Caption: it&#39;s actually not made for the farmer to

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:25.150
Caption: be spraying a ton of those designs every

00:24:23.469 --> 00:24:28.719
Caption: there because that&#39;s a really expensive

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:30.540
Caption: right so instead what they can do is

00:24:28.719 --> 00:24:33.609
Caption: actually just spray pesticides where

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:35.680
Caption: pests are going to be and then if you

00:24:33.609 --> 00:24:38.589
Caption: learning to predict that great and then

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:40.510
Caption: you&#39;re using a fewer about our less of

00:24:38.589 --> 00:24:43.419
Caption: that which is a win we win all barrels

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.650
Caption: into precision agriculture so if we were

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.359
Caption: to tackle something at precision

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.070
Caption: irrigation that seems fairly

00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:50.290
Caption: straightforward right any people do like

00:24:48.069 --> 00:24:51.579
Caption: IOT right so you can have like a subset

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.900
Caption: sitting in their backpack right now that

00:24:51.579 --> 00:24:55.260
Caption: they&#39;re properly measured water levels

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:58.359
Caption: and the guy the moisture one that I

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.829
Caption: played this before and so great they

00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:01.000
Caption: seemed somebody to talk with us we just

00:24:59.829 --> 00:25:02.798
Caption: sensors in the ground would be to

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.449
Caption: monitor things like pH level and water

00:25:02.798 --> 00:25:05.949
Caption: and stuff like that and so what I&#39;m

00:25:04.449 --> 00:25:07.808
Caption: getting super excited up with something

00:25:05.949 --> 00:25:08.979
Caption: I&#39;m talking to Randy and maybe there&#39;s

00:25:07.808 --> 00:25:10.449
Caption: something that&#39;s fresh problems actually

00:25:08.979 --> 00:25:13.298
Caption: that it&#39;s costing about a thousand

00:25:10.449 --> 00:25:14.949
Caption: dollars per sensor and that&#39;s so crazy

00:25:13.298 --> 00:25:17.079
Caption: to you guys because that&#39;s one didn&#39;t

00:25:14.949 --> 00:25:18.788
Caption: wake you have like no no maybe you&#39;re

00:25:17.079 --> 00:25:22.449
Caption: not looking at the same website I&#39;m like

00:25:18.788 --> 00:25:25.538
Caption: have you ever heard of comment rather of

00:25:22.449 --> 00:25:27.339
Caption: course he was aware in the problem is

00:25:25.538 --> 00:25:27.729
Caption: not actually the cost of the sensor

00:25:27.339 --> 00:25:29.890
Caption: itself

00:25:27.729 --> 00:25:32.500
Caption: sensors are really in the tens of

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:36.539
Caption: dollars so what could be causing that

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:39.459
Caption: that money and pasta like some magazines

00:25:36.538 --> 00:25:41.048
Caption: well the next thing it has power right

00:25:39.459 --> 00:25:43.778
Caption: maybe you know these things are at farm

00:25:41.048 --> 00:25:45.250
Caption: so is it the idea of so can we you know

00:25:43.779 --> 00:25:47.529
Caption: how do you charge them right how many

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.089
Caption: those things charge and it turns out I

00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:52.299
Caption: was wrong about that once it wasn&#39;t the

00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:54.638
Caption: powder we actually do solar panels and

00:25:52.298 --> 00:25:57.760
Caption: the solar panels cost roughly like 50 to

00:25:54.639 --> 00:25:59.889
Caption: 100 US dollars for a solar count so

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.119
Caption: again we&#39;re talking like hundred now per

00:25:59.889 --> 00:26:03.760
Caption: sensor that we&#39;re still not gonna

00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:06.010
Caption: thousand and just kind of see a tangent

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:08.349
Caption: perfectly this is what our setup looks

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:10.119
Caption: like you can see the the board really

00:26:08.349 --> 00:26:11.768
Caption: cheap although there&#39;s a low competition

00:26:10.119 --> 00:26:14.199
Caption: that actually gives it include

00:26:11.769 --> 00:26:16.149
Caption: waterproof casing and then there&#39;s some

00:26:14.199 --> 00:26:18.489
Caption: leaves that stand out and it&#39;s about to

00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:20.679
Caption: be comes at the base of that pole which

00:26:18.489 --> 00:26:22.630
Caption: has a solar panel on top it charges

00:26:20.678 --> 00:26:24.219
Caption: everything and then you very illusive

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.808
Caption: leaves sneaking out but you can bury the

00:26:24.219 --> 00:26:28.119
Caption: leaves in the ground to like measure the

00:26:25.808 --> 00:26:29.859
Caption: temperature at different depths or a on

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:31.918
Caption: water levels and all kinds of things I

00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:34.119
Caption: don&#39;t do for ducks and we also have a

00:26:31.918 --> 00:26:35.829
Caption: camera mounted on the science

00:26:34.119 --> 00:26:39.099
Caption: so that they could get a real-time view

00:26:35.829 --> 00:26:41.949
Caption: of the farm and it takes pictures in RGB

00:26:39.099 --> 00:26:43.719
Caption: natural color as well as infrared so you

00:26:41.949 --> 00:26:45.158
Caption: get a nice kind of T determine to look

00:26:43.719 --> 00:26:48.428
Caption: at your farm as well with it different

00:26:45.159 --> 00:26:50.799
Caption: places all over the farm okay so maybe

00:26:48.428 --> 00:26:52.288
Caption: it&#39;s like $200 percent right so where is

00:26:50.798 --> 00:26:55.750
Caption: the rest of this money coming from

00:26:52.288 --> 00:26:58.449
Caption: turns out the problem was connectivity

00:26:55.750 --> 00:27:01.209
Caption: all right it was getting the data off of

00:26:58.449 --> 00:27:02.709
Caption: those sensors and into the cloud we did

00:27:01.209 --> 00:27:06.398
Caption: aggravated and actually do something

00:27:02.709 --> 00:27:10.538
Caption: useful with it and so the reason for

00:27:06.399 --> 00:27:11.130
Caption: that is we think about a large of the

00:27:10.538 --> 00:27:13.389
Caption: Pepa

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.668
Caption: if you&#39;ve ever been doing a very rural

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:17.979
Caption: area and let&#39;s say if you guys are

00:27:15.668 --> 00:27:20.408
Caption: making women across Australia has her

00:27:17.979 --> 00:27:22.418
Caption: cell phone signal there you get great

00:27:20.409 --> 00:27:26.049
Caption: coverage all the way across I&#39;m guessing

00:27:22.418 --> 00:27:29.079
Caption: no and from the looks of them

00:27:26.048 --> 00:27:30.699
Caption: so what same thing the Ohio rural areas

00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:32.798
Caption: those healthy carriers are at such

00:27:30.699 --> 00:27:34.808
Caption: ability to provide and it very sparsely

00:27:32.798 --> 00:27:37.028
Caption: populated areas and a lot of farmland

00:27:34.808 --> 00:27:39.609
Caption: tends to be more sparsely populated area

00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:41.590
Caption: so cell phone coverage is typically not

00:27:39.609 --> 00:27:43.239
Caption: great so a lot of times if you have to

00:27:41.589 --> 00:27:45.369
Caption: do this you have to layer up a custom

00:27:43.239 --> 00:27:47.199
Caption: cellular solution which tends to be very

00:27:45.369 --> 00:27:49.479
Caption: expensive so that&#39;s really where the

00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:51.099
Caption: thousand dollars per sensor is coming so

00:27:49.479 --> 00:27:53.709
Caption: so they&#39;ll tell you there&#39;s one option

00:27:51.099 --> 00:27:55.719
Caption: another things Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi is the

00:27:53.709 --> 00:27:57.459
Caption: great technology but the only problem is

00:27:55.719 --> 00:28:02.048
Caption: it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t stretch very far

00:27:57.459 --> 00:28:03.969
Caption: right like I have a my child&#39;s bus stops

00:28:02.048 --> 00:28:05.408
Caption: literally right across the street from

00:28:03.969 --> 00:28:08.469
Caption: my house right

00:28:05.409 --> 00:28:09.700
Caption: however when I like you know leave by my

00:28:08.469 --> 00:28:13.119
Caption: office and walk across the street to

00:28:09.699 --> 00:28:15.278
Caption: pick her up from the bus stop literally

00:28:13.119 --> 00:28:16.839
Caption: a lot of Wi-Fi range like just across

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:19.029
Caption: the street from my house I can&#39;t even

00:28:16.839 --> 00:28:21.099
Caption: reach my home Wi-Fi so

00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:22.480
Caption: Wi-Fi you need so many computers they&#39;re

00:28:21.099 --> 00:28:25.428
Caption: talking about these acres and acres of

00:28:22.479 --> 00:28:28.729
Caption: farmland you need so many reviews

00:28:25.428 --> 00:28:31.669
Caption: so two solutions to this solution number

00:28:28.729 --> 00:28:35.359
Caption: one is can we use fewer sensors and then

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:37.820
Caption: be able to extrapolate that data to

00:28:35.359 --> 00:28:40.699
Caption: learn more from from lives essentially

00:28:37.819 --> 00:28:43.069
Caption: into essentially what we&#39;re doing is

00:28:40.699 --> 00:28:44.750
Caption: we&#39;re coupling doing fewer sensors and

00:28:43.069 --> 00:28:47.239
Caption: then we&#39;re coupling that with aerial

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:49.459
Caption: imagery overhead and primarily we use

00:28:47.239 --> 00:28:51.079
Caption: drones for that and there&#39;s actually

00:28:49.459 --> 00:28:52.189
Caption: some really cool I&#39;d love to get into

00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:53.599
Caption: the job work too because they&#39;re doing

00:28:52.189 --> 00:28:55.369
Caption: all kinds of battery optimizations that

00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:56.959
Caption: are really neat but the drone to ask me

00:28:55.369 --> 00:28:58.729
Caption: about that later on your mark but

00:28:56.959 --> 00:29:00.020
Caption: there&#39;s essentially the drones fly

00:28:58.729 --> 00:29:02.150
Caption: overhead they take the aerial imagery

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.160
Caption: and then the machine learning model

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:06.710
Caption: takes that aerial imagery from drone

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.150
Caption: footage or so if some cases where

00:29:06.709 --> 00:29:09.289
Caption: there&#39;s fall out of regulations and

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:13.280
Caption: drones are not a feasible solution

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:15.619
Caption: they&#39;ll use a essentially a big helium

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:17.239
Caption: balloon and tether it to the ground with

00:29:15.619 --> 00:29:19.699
Caption: the camera and then the camera I like

00:29:17.239 --> 00:29:21.140
Caption: make silicon and cannot take pictures of

00:29:19.699 --> 00:29:23.479
Caption: all of that and either walk with it on a

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:27.109
Caption: lead or just planted somewhere as it&#39;s

00:29:23.479 --> 00:29:29.058
Caption: not big enough so we take that aerial

00:29:27.109 --> 00:29:31.219
Caption: imagery from usually drones sometimes

00:29:29.058 --> 00:29:32.569
Caption: the balloons and then take that from the

00:29:31.219 --> 00:29:34.489
Caption: data with the sensors that we do have

00:29:32.569 --> 00:29:36.469
Caption: you can feed those both into a machine

00:29:34.489 --> 00:29:40.428
Caption: learning model and then that is able to

00:29:36.469 --> 00:29:41.928
Caption: predict the information that we can ask

00:29:40.428 --> 00:29:44.000
Caption: and so those machine learning models are

00:29:41.928 --> 00:29:46.189
Caption: actually based on Gaussian processes and

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.589
Caption: it&#39;s essentially conceptually you can

00:29:46.189 --> 00:29:52.369
Caption: think about other but it is easy to keep

00:29:48.589 --> 00:29:53.270
Caption: mixed what is the spatial similarity

00:29:52.369 --> 00:29:54.800
Caption: right so things

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:57.950
Caption: farmland that tends to be close together

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.809
Caption: tends to have similar values usually the

00:29:57.949 --> 00:30:02.750
Caption: other conceptual thing is visual

00:29:59.808 --> 00:30:04.599
Caption: similarity so if I have a dark patch of

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:06.099
Caption: land right here on a dark patch

00:30:04.599 --> 00:30:07.569
Caption: here maybe they were both freshly he

00:30:06.099 --> 00:30:09.699
Caption: repeated and have similar moisture

00:30:07.569 --> 00:30:11.259
Caption: levels and that tends to work as well so

00:30:09.699 --> 00:30:13.149
Caption: those allow you to construct a machine

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:15.130
Caption: learning Maps to figure out like that

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.479
Caption: moisture levels of an entire field even

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.300
Caption: if you don&#39;t have sensors on the whole

00:30:16.479 --> 00:30:20.530
Caption: field all right

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:22.239
Caption: so putting that all together that

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.830
Caption: enables all kinds of cool things if you

00:30:22.239 --> 00:30:26.280
Caption: have all this data coming in off your

00:30:23.829 --> 00:30:29.679
Caption: barbecue enable on precision irrigation

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:31.570
Caption: where to best do fertilizer applications

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.460
Caption: predicting yield all kinds of stuff you

00:30:31.569 --> 00:30:36.219
Caption: can do with this great kind of temporal

00:30:33.459 --> 00:30:37.599
Caption: spatial avanti of the farm now this one

00:30:36.219 --> 00:30:39.579
Caption: other solution I want to mention because

00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:40.689
Caption: we you know we talked about how how do

00:30:39.579 --> 00:30:42.039
Caption: we get to stay off the farm and the

00:30:40.689 --> 00:30:42.459
Caption: connectivity challenges that sort of

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.380
Caption: thing

00:30:42.459 --> 00:30:46.000
Caption: so reducing the number of sensors we

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.619
Caption: have as women solutions that there at

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.819
Caption: Richmond is the second one and we still

00:30:47.619 --> 00:30:51.040
Caption: need to get the data through sensors we

00:30:48.819 --> 00:30:52.239
Caption: do have into the cloud right so what

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.780
Caption: just looked answered that connectivity

00:30:52.239 --> 00:30:56.079
Caption: challenge and so this is actually really

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.300
Caption: cool

00:30:56.079 --> 00:31:01.329
Caption: they&#39;re pioneering the use of something

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:04.330
Caption: called television white spaces so the

00:31:01.329 --> 00:31:07.659
Caption: idea behind this is traditional Wi-Fi

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:11.380
Caption: operates at approximately five leaders

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:12.729
Caption: all right and so that&#39;s awesome but we

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.650
Caption: think about something like a TV

00:31:12.729 --> 00:31:17.199
Caption: broadcast or a television broadcast

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:19.000
Caption: that&#39;s operating at a much lower

00:31:17.199 --> 00:31:20.739
Caption: frequency if you&#39;re remembering science

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.479
Caption: you know what&#39;s lower frequencies you

00:31:20.739 --> 00:31:24.040
Caption: know the way from stretch much further

00:31:22.479 --> 00:31:29.020
Caption: right much much longer

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:32.200
Caption: and so the idea is to actually turn only

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.940
Caption: used television cameras so these are

00:31:32.199 --> 00:31:35.889
Caption: likely we call these television white

00:31:33.939 --> 00:31:38.079
Caption: spaces so basically frequencies where

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:41.290
Caption: these are faint broadcast on television

00:31:38.079 --> 00:31:44.439
Caption: spectrum just to create an Internet to

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:46.570
Caption: send data packets over unused television

00:31:44.439 --> 00:31:48.819
Caption: stations they can&#39;t just do this you

00:31:46.569 --> 00:31:52.149
Caption: have to work the local government and

00:31:48.819 --> 00:31:52.869
Caption: ensure that this is okay but you can

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.680
Caption: actually start

00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:59.410
Caption: I lived this in Kenya and we think at

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.880
Caption: doing this and like alcohol about urban

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.500
Caption: areas as well just to enable like a

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:04.540
Caption: whole city with with Internet and that

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.670
Caption: sort of thing so that&#39;s do PMI

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.859
Caption: television white-spaces and so what&#39;s

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:11.830
Caption: really cool about this is that one

00:32:08.859 --> 00:32:14.410
Caption: television likewise these router just

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:18.130
Caption: broadcast so far so imagine like you

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:20.020
Caption: live like 16 kilometres away you can

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:22.030
Caption: still access your home internet from

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.219
Caption: here like how cool would that be right

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:26.349
Caption: so really really neat out there one

00:32:24.219 --> 00:32:28.150
Caption: television whitespace router can usually

00:32:26.349 --> 00:32:30.280
Caption: service you know eat those acres of

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.989
Caption: farmland so a nice and nice solution

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:35.050
Caption: that Robert pioneering that&#39;s worked

00:32:31.989 --> 00:32:36.760
Caption: quite well all right so all that&#39;s

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:38.920
Caption: happened about a bunch of pilot cities

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.239
Caption: going on and there&#39;s kind of the overall

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.859
Caption: architecture that I talked about so that

00:32:40.239 --> 00:32:43.808
Caption: is farming also that Microsoft Research

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:47.380
Caption: all right the next time I want something

00:32:43.808 --> 00:32:49.058
Caption: close to spot so spot is a systemic

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:53.140
Caption: motion detection the problem we&#39;re

00:32:49.058 --> 00:32:55.390
Caption: trying to solve here is the poaching is

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:58.660
Caption: a very very very real concern and so

00:32:55.390 --> 00:33:00.459
Caption: here&#39;s our Balam from NPR and if you

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:05.920
Caption: kind of zoom in on this video the date

00:33:00.459 --> 00:33:08.229
Caption: is September 3rd 2017 all right so this

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.460
Caption: was within the last year so this is not

00:33:08.229 --> 00:33:11.140
Caption: something that used to happen there but

00:33:09.459 --> 00:33:15.669
Caption: I think this is still very much a real

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:17.229
Caption: problem today and just to kind of talk

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:19.270
Caption: about how why this is such a problem

00:33:17.229 --> 00:33:21.189
Caption: here&#39;s a quick look at one of these

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:23.260
Caption: wildlife sanctuaries these these animals

00:33:21.189 --> 00:33:24.369
Caption: we talk about rhinos and elephants and

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.709
Caption: some of these large animals that our

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:29.209
Caption: coach since there are such big animals

00:33:26.709 --> 00:33:31.339
Caption: they have a very wide range of

00:33:29.209 --> 00:33:32.869
Caption: where they were they wrong and so when

00:33:31.339 --> 00:33:35.179
Caption: you consider the problem of Omega this

00:33:32.869 --> 00:33:37.309
Caption: we have all over a limited resource of

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.810
Caption: Park Rangers thanks so much space like

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:39.860
Caption: how do we best predict where the

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.300
Caption: butchers are going to be bring the

00:33:39.859 --> 00:33:43.869
Caption: animals are going to be and make sure

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:47.300
Caption: they can get out in front of it so

00:33:43.869 --> 00:33:48.829
Caption: poaching is a is a huge industry I know

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.360
Caption: people are like that wouldn&#39;t even do

00:33:48.829 --> 00:33:52.760
Caption: this that&#39;s so crazy but when you look

00:33:50.359 --> 00:33:54.140
Caption: at kind of the economy here sisters why

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.320
Caption: this is happening

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:59.030
Caption: the average per-capita income economy so

00:33:57.319 --> 00:34:01.459
Caption: Saharan Africa is about seven hundred

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:03.349
Caption: and sixty two dollars if you look at the

00:34:01.459 --> 00:34:07.459
Caption: amount of money enough for a single

00:34:03.349 --> 00:34:09.739
Caption: apartment right no more it&#39;s literally

00:34:07.459 --> 00:34:11.869
Caption: worth more than gold of in terms of it

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:14.629
Caption: per pound and same thing with the ivory

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:17.000
Caption: is that far but it&#39;s still a one-person

00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:20.119
Caption: elephant will give you basically a

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.979
Caption: lifetime&#39;s worth of income so this is a

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:24.800
Caption: very real issue and state of the art

00:34:21.979 --> 00:34:27.469
Caption: right now how we fight it is drones

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.330
Caption: flying overhead and the drones are

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:31.609
Caption: sending back streaming data in real time

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.050
Caption: and that there are treatments sitting at

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:35.510
Caption: screens that have to monitor the drones

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:39.140
Caption: and have to look and recognize okay

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:41.360
Caption: here is the here is the this is use the

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:44.479
Caption: data coming in this is really hard for a

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:46.280
Caption: number of reasons number one you can&#39;t

00:34:44.479 --> 00:34:47.629
Caption: scale well right it&#39;s a few more drones

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.010
Caption: when you put more drones in the air who

00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:51.919
Caption: have to have more Cubans watching the

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:54.339
Caption: screens moment only so many screens look

00:34:51.919 --> 00:34:55.989
Caption: out and then a lot of

00:34:54.339 --> 00:34:57.400
Caption: at night so a lot of types of people

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:59.618
Caption: that are monitoring that they have to

00:34:57.399 --> 00:35:00.159
Caption: work overnight and fatigue is a real

00:34:59.618 --> 00:35:02.318
Caption: thing

00:35:00.159 --> 00:35:04.899
Caption: so the implement that is this seems like

00:35:02.319 --> 00:35:06.729
Caption: a great thing for provision right how do

00:35:04.899 --> 00:35:08.588
Caption: we do how do we take by using computer

00:35:06.729 --> 00:35:11.468
Caption: vision to solve that problem that will

00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:13.960
Caption: scale and computers don&#39;t get tired so

00:35:11.468 --> 00:35:15.789
Caption: the problem is it&#39;s just a harder

00:35:13.959 --> 00:35:17.348
Caption: problem it&#39;s very hard computer vision

00:35:15.789 --> 00:35:20.289
Caption: problems right number of reasons so

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:22.599
Caption: number one we&#39;re the fitter just coming

00:35:20.289 --> 00:35:24.999
Caption: back with infrared footage so infrared

00:35:22.599 --> 00:35:26.319
Caption: looks something like like that so that&#39;s

00:35:24.999 --> 00:35:29.609
Caption: kind of what we&#39;re looking at here is

00:35:26.319 --> 00:35:32.289
Caption: this gray and black and white blobs and

00:35:29.608 --> 00:35:35.318
Caption: the first thing is actually the original

00:35:32.289 --> 00:35:36.939
Caption: image then we have unfresh cooling right

00:35:35.319 --> 00:35:38.710
Caption: there where it&#39;s popping things that are

00:35:36.939 --> 00:35:40.929
Caption: above a certain threshold it makes them

00:35:38.709 --> 00:35:42.519
Caption: later and then it also doesn&#39;t work to

00:35:40.929 --> 00:35:44.739
Caption: stabilize for frame differences and

00:35:42.519 --> 00:35:46.599
Caption: what&#39;s what that means is the drone is

00:35:44.739 --> 00:35:48.339
Caption: moving overhead as well as sometimes the

00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:49.809
Caption: animals are moving below but we have

00:35:48.339 --> 00:35:52.119
Caption: animals moving that&#39;s actually been

00:35:49.809 --> 00:35:54.130
Caption: indicator that it&#39;s now but I need to do

00:35:52.118 --> 00:35:55.149
Caption: some work to do some fun math to just

00:35:54.129 --> 00:35:57.248
Caption: make sure that when one thing is moving

00:35:55.149 --> 00:35:59.409
Caption: another thing is moving you can

00:35:57.249 --> 00:36:02.289
Caption: calculate that all that okay all right

00:35:59.409 --> 00:36:04.389
Caption: but this is very very hard because first

00:36:02.289 --> 00:36:06.160
Caption: of all the drones putting on the height

00:36:04.389 --> 00:36:07.808
Caption: of the drones and where they can fly it

00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:10.209
Caption: can get very very slick but it could be

00:36:07.809 --> 00:36:12.130
Caption: like a you know a couple pixels of where

00:36:10.209 --> 00:36:14.199
Caption: the actual animals is in them in there

00:36:12.129 --> 00:36:15.879
Caption: and the motion that motion of the

00:36:14.199 --> 00:36:17.108
Caption: stabilization actually makes it tricky

00:36:15.879 --> 00:36:19.058
Caption: too and one thing that&#39;s moving and a

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:20.409
Caption: second thing is moving as well and then

00:36:19.059 --> 00:36:23.049
Caption: just the fact that these are kind of

00:36:20.409 --> 00:36:24.999
Caption: thermal infrared images like it&#39;s hard I

00:36:23.049 --> 00:36:26.739
Caption: mean do you guys see it&#39;s right there in

00:36:24.999 --> 00:36:27.479
Caption: out of the boxes and the less so that&#39;s

00:36:26.739 --> 00:36:30.870
Caption: the

00:36:27.479 --> 00:36:33.060
Caption: real folk jerison because I sure didn&#39;t

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:34.890
Caption: I don&#39;t have that expertise so it&#39;s

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.390
Caption: really hard to pick out real butchers

00:36:34.889 --> 00:36:38.969
Caption: I&#39;m in his situation so it&#39;s a tough

00:36:36.389 --> 00:36:40.469
Caption: problem but a bunch of researchers that

00:36:38.969 --> 00:36:43.260
Caption: this is work that&#39;s being done at home

00:36:40.469 --> 00:36:45.659
Caption: by the University of Southern California

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:48.179
Caption: and their research they&#39;re actually

00:36:45.659 --> 00:36:50.309
Caption: using Azure to be able to do some of

00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:52.530
Caption: this processing so they basically if

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:55.770
Caption: they have a stable internet connection

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:58.739
Caption: to the data center real time to a like a

00:36:55.770 --> 00:37:01.649
Caption: GPU laptop that they have they&#39;re on in

00:36:58.739 --> 00:37:03.119
Caption: the field and then if if they have good

00:37:01.649 --> 00:37:04.319
Caption: Wi-Fi connection they&#39;ll set it up to

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.730
Caption: address for processing and they trade

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.130
Caption: the models there and then otherwise

00:37:05.729 --> 00:37:09.750
Caption: they&#39;ll just use the actual laptop to do

00:37:08.129 --> 00:37:11.099
Caption: to get results because this is something

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.929
Caption: that also has to be difficult time

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.430
Caption: because once the poacher shoots the

00:37:12.929 --> 00:37:16.979
Caption: animal it&#39;s game over

00:37:14.429 --> 00:37:20.669
Caption: you can&#39;t undo that so it has to be done

00:37:16.979 --> 00:37:22.080
Caption: about footsy as well so that&#39;s here&#39;s a

00:37:20.669 --> 00:37:23.969
Caption: quick video that shows that one of a

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.380
Caption: field tests that they did and you can

00:37:23.969 --> 00:37:27.239
Caption: see that when I had the little boxes

00:37:25.379 --> 00:37:30.000
Caption: surrounded it&#39;s accurately recognizes

00:37:27.239 --> 00:37:33.239
Caption: the people and so they are running and

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.909
Caption: we&#39;re almost there thank you mate

00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:38.010
Caption: all right one one one other story is

00:37:35.909 --> 00:37:39.780
Caption: some people I guess so this is one I

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:42.510
Caption: would love to see catch on in Australia

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:44.580
Caption: so I am sure this is a group that is

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:47.100
Caption: nonprofits this is another not Microsoft

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:48.959
Caption: story and they basically collect data

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:51.989
Caption: there&#39;s a little app that allows you to

00:37:48.959 --> 00:37:55.649
Caption: take a picture of any flora or fauna and

00:37:51.989 --> 00:37:57.629
Caption: then it takes that image it wants you to

00:37:55.649 --> 00:38:00.419
Caption: label it so it&#39;s a labels data set which

00:37:57.629 --> 00:38:02.219
Caption: is awesome and then give me the time and

00:38:00.419 --> 00:38:03.569
Caption: the location of the observation and then

00:38:02.219 --> 00:38:04.800
Caption: uploads there and then they take that

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.600
Caption: they said they make it publicly

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.520
Caption: available to researchers and

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.800
Caption: conservation biologists and all these

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:13.320
Caption: people to have this great index and what

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.840
Caption: so it&#39;s like a crowdsourced version of

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.670
Caption: that so that is my naturalism which is

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.739
Caption: there it&#39;s a big thriving community a

00:38:17.669 --> 00:38:21.000
Caption: lot of people use it but why but the

00:38:19.739 --> 00:38:23.399
Caption: reason I wanted mention she specifically

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.439
Caption: is that we&#39;ve actually trained the model

00:38:23.399 --> 00:38:26.879
Caption: based on the natural estate up and then

00:38:25.439 --> 00:38:28.829
Caption: I was working with some researchers at

00:38:26.879 --> 00:38:33.569
Caption: unnatural University who are trying to

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:35.430
Caption: recognize these specific and we were I

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.570
Caption: trying to use this and I hope to trying

00:38:35.429 --> 00:38:38.429
Caption: to use the one that we trade on that

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:40.800
Caption: data and it totally didn&#39;t work because

00:38:38.429 --> 00:38:42.719
Caption: people like financials is really popular

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.250
Caption: in North America so there&#39;s a huge North

00:38:42.719 --> 00:38:46.409
Caption: American bias to the data that&#39;s

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:48.780
Caption: currently there and human says crazy

00:38:46.409 --> 00:38:50.760
Caption: bees here man so if your piece look very

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.650
Caption: different than our little team bees so

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.270
Caption: if it wasn&#39;t performing almost I would

00:38:52.649 --> 00:38:55.949
Caption: love to get more people like tell your

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:58.860
Caption: friends download it I use this all the

00:38:55.949 --> 00:39:11.250
Caption: time and I need you watch with my kids

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:13.890
Caption: oh it&#39;s true yeah you know there&#39;s no

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.969
Caption: people where either I was the first one

00:39:13.889 --> 00:39:17.849
Caption: that came to mind because I saw one

00:39:14.969 --> 00:39:19.500
Caption: yesterday so those little things

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.729
Caption: I know Birds I don&#39;t know anything but

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.379
Caption: my kids actually just grabbed this one

00:39:20.729 --> 00:39:24.060
Caption: for me now I want to learn what this is

00:39:22.379 --> 00:39:26.579
Caption: and like they love it because if you see

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:28.770
Caption: a crazy squirrel or little animals or

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.600
Caption: any plants you can learn and actually

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:34.320
Caption: see what they are using the classifier

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:36.239
Caption: so it takes this step out to provide a

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.070
Caption: label one that just has been a picture

00:39:36.239 --> 00:39:40.020
Caption: of her but one thing I thought what kind

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:41.670
Caption: of bird it is so how can I provide with

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:44.100
Caption: labels data if I don&#39;t know what kind of

00:39:41.669 --> 00:39:45.750
Caption: art it is into a machine learning so we

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.070
Caption: trained a classifier on a bunch of you

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.439
Caption: literally existent and then use that

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:51.449
Caption: classifier that when you actually use

00:39:49.439 --> 00:39:53.739
Caption: the app you can click something called

00:39:51.449 --> 00:39:55.780
Caption: view suggestions and then if you

00:39:53.739 --> 00:39:57.520
Caption: machine learning classifiers which uses

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.320
Caption: the image of the picture that you chunk

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:03.820
Caption: so it&#39;s using computer vision plus if we

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:06.160
Caption: use data on the actual location and feed

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:08.320
Caption: those together to make it available so

00:40:06.159 --> 00:40:09.760
Caption: that&#39;s what&#39;s happening right there and

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.840
Caption: then just to jump to the example let me

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.669
Caption: just make it look good so this is a

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.380
Caption: picture I took in Stockholm and so

00:40:12.669 --> 00:40:16.449
Caption: here&#39;s what it looks like when you put

00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:18.639
Caption: it in the app it asks what did you see

00:40:16.449 --> 00:40:20.050
Caption: you actually open it will grab this

00:40:18.639 --> 00:40:21.368
Caption: right from the camera if you take the

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:23.320
Caption: picture right in the app and give you

00:40:21.368 --> 00:40:25.299
Caption: the location the date time and then if

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.590
Caption: you took that what did you see you two

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.929
Caption: suggestions if you don&#39;t know what it is

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:31.119
Caption: it invokes this PC search and you can

00:40:28.929 --> 00:40:32.949
Caption: see here I&#39;m annoyed you with that bird

00:40:31.118 --> 00:40:35.379
Caption: because I was guessing maybe Ukraine or

00:40:32.949 --> 00:40:37.149
Caption: maybe a heron and it was able to tell me

00:40:35.379 --> 00:40:39.399
Caption: yeah I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s an errand and

00:40:37.149 --> 00:40:41.618
Caption: then here&#39;s kind of the top tips easy

00:40:39.399 --> 00:40:43.659
Caption: suggestions and if you click into each

00:40:41.618 --> 00:40:46.839
Caption: one of these it actually shows you more

00:40:43.659 --> 00:40:48.579
Caption: detail of the great herring and you

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.739
Caption: herring it so I was able to correct and

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:52.570
Caption: say oh this one is nearby and it&#39;s the

00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:54.310
Caption: it looks you cover like that so psyched

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:57.100
Caption: and then I was able to submit up and

00:40:54.310 --> 00:41:00.850
Caption: make that available a lot for for the

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:02.500
Caption: world so really really quick look about

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:03.910
Caption: we did train something with that and

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.409
Caption: you&#39;re welcome to check that out if you

00:41:03.909 --> 00:41:06.819
Caption: want and put a little demo but we took

00:41:05.409 --> 00:41:08.889
Caption: the items as soon as I can freedom to

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:11.140
Caption: species possibly hdpi and if it&#39;s just

00:41:08.889 --> 00:41:13.510
Caption: the 5,000 most popular animals and

00:41:11.139 --> 00:41:16.569
Caption: trained antiproton along that so you can

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:18.130
Caption: actually go here and classify and see

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:20.560
Caption: how it works and this case you&#39;re

00:41:18.129 --> 00:41:22.329
Caption: something that looks like it can tell I

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.160
Caption: can differentiate that this is a coyote

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:26.150
Caption: and it actually knew that as opposed to

00:41:24.159 --> 00:41:29.520
Caption: wolf and a lot of other things

00:41:26.149 --> 00:41:31.520
Caption: so happy to show that in more detail

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:34.409
Caption: later but I wanna be like us enough time

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.780
Caption: one last story I wanna show you is a

00:41:34.409 --> 00:41:39.299
Caption: group called wild meat so what they&#39;re

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:42.300
Caption: trying to do is solve the problem with

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:44.010
Caption: apples happy right so there was a verbal

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.590
Caption: spritz with National Geographic we&#39;re

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:48.510
Caption: really rare mail found people went to

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:50.520
Caption: tag it in the process of tagging it

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.870
Caption: ending up tragically killing the animal

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.120
Caption: which was the opposite of what they

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:57.750
Caption: wanted to do because it was rare amazing

00:41:54.120 --> 00:42:00.210
Caption: animals so what they said was you know

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:01.679
Caption: can we do better right you guys know

00:42:00.209 --> 00:42:04.020
Caption: that as human beings we can uniquely

00:42:01.679 --> 00:42:07.229
Caption: identifying fingerprints right when you

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:09.300
Caption: say does advanced fingerprints well the

00:42:07.229 --> 00:42:10.439
Caption: same is true for zebras and their

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.120
Caption: strengths you guys may have heard that

00:42:10.439 --> 00:42:15.209
Caption: right then seekers have unique strengths

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:17.640
Caption: hunters it&#39;s also true for large cats

00:42:15.209 --> 00:42:19.139
Caption: and their spot patterns for giraffes in

00:42:17.639 --> 00:42:21.959
Caption: the works and their necks all of these

00:42:19.139 --> 00:42:24.629
Caption: types of things so what they can do is

00:42:21.959 --> 00:42:26.489
Caption: actually take you like that and the

00:42:24.629 --> 00:42:28.679
Caption: state bases thousands of animals and

00:42:26.489 --> 00:42:30.149
Caption: then be able to uniquely do that and you

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:32.399
Caption: can identify this individual pound of

00:42:30.149 --> 00:42:34.559
Caption: muscle the last thing I wanna say that

00:42:32.399 --> 00:42:36.179
Caption: is so cool about this so that is a

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.610
Caption: really cool computer vision story right

00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:42.179
Caption: really really cool they&#39;re able to make

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:44.160
Caption: take this data and do some aviation but

00:42:42.179 --> 00:42:46.020
Caption: what it takes a story from good to great

00:42:44.159 --> 00:42:48.329
Caption: if they actually augment their data

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:50.159
Caption: using social media all right so let&#39;s

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:52.170
Caption: say I explain one of the things whale

00:42:50.159 --> 00:42:54.239
Caption: whales hurt that works they are uniquely

00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:56.010
Caption: can identify whale sharks and so we

00:42:54.239 --> 00:42:56.840
Caption: private random person I don&#39;t want to

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:58.909
Caption: Kim and I

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.890
Caption: video and I upload that to YouTube they

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:02.959
Caption: actually have an intelligent agent that

00:43:00.889 --> 00:43:04.909
Caption: wakes up at 10 a.m. every night it

00:43:02.959 --> 00:43:07.040
Caption: searches the web it uses an NLP you can

00:43:04.909 --> 00:43:09.289
Caption: find things related to will sharks take

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:11.090
Caption: that video extract the keyframes and

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:13.850
Caption: then it&#39;s able to identify and match

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:15.950
Caption: those against its database and find even

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:18.229
Caption: more new whale sharks and then with that

00:43:15.949 --> 00:43:20.389
Caption: data it gets us to make population

00:43:18.229 --> 00:43:24.409
Caption: densities as well as track individual

00:43:20.389 --> 00:43:25.819
Caption: migration patterns whales in social

00:43:24.409 --> 00:43:30.020
Caption: media for like Instagram in your food

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:32.030
Caption: like I just think it&#39;s such a cool use

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.500
Caption: so that&#39;s kind of what the process looks

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.850
Caption: like and then they can use that there

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.350
Caption: and I&#39;m happy to show you guys a demo

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:37.489
Caption: about later alright so we&#39;ve covered a

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:40.640
Caption: lot of different things we see

00:43:37.489 --> 00:43:42.379
Caption: mosquitoes agriculture poaching from us

00:43:40.639 --> 00:43:44.419
Caption: first own species identification as well

00:43:42.379 --> 00:43:46.399
Caption: as identify different kinds of animals

00:43:44.419 --> 00:43:48.079
Caption: if you want to learn any more about this

00:43:46.399 --> 00:43:49.339
Caption: research papers any of that there&#39;s a

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.229
Caption: ton of great links right there

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.820
Caption: and then don&#39;t forget to tell people

00:43:51.229 --> 00:43:53.929
Caption: about the I first grant program as well

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:56.479
Caption: if you&#39;re doing any work on machine

00:43:53.929 --> 00:43:57.800
Caption: learning because together hopefully we

00:43:56.479 --> 00:43:59.929
Caption: could use machine learning and

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.400
Caption: technology to make a difference thank

00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:03.668
Caption: you

00:44:00.399 --> 00:44:03.668
Caption: [Applause]

00:44:09.689 --> 00:44:11.750
Caption: you
