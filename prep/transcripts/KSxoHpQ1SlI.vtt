Caption: welcome everyone I hope you&#39;ve been

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:07.739
Caption: enjoying the event

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:10.079
Caption: um and managed to get something tasty to

00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:12.539
Caption: eat for lunch now our next speaker is

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:15.598
Caption: Trent Jones his talk is going to be

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:18.118
Caption: about architecture for all Trent from AI

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:20.359
Caption: media has been designing building and

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:23.219
Caption: testing software for over 10 years

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:25.500
Caption: across a wide wide variety of Industries

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:28.198
Caption: he has a passion for devops and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.659
Caption: inclusive software along with a lifelong

00:00:28.198 --> 00:00:32.959
Caption: love of sharing and learning over to

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.959
Caption: Trent

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.760
Caption: foreign

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.139
Caption: [Applause]

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:42.359
Caption: thank you everyone for for joining me

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:44.639
Caption: today so uh this is a little talk I&#39;ve

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.899
Caption: been developing across a number of

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:46.738
Caption: different

00:00:45.898 --> 00:00:49.199
Caption: um

00:00:46.738 --> 00:00:50.398
Caption: engagements in my previous life I was a

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.920
Caption: consultant so I did a lot of

00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:56.878
Caption: architecture diagramming and

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:59.099
Caption: um the various likes uh so thank you for

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.079
Caption: joining me um first off thank you to all

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:02.398
Caption: the sponsors today wouldn&#39;t be possible

00:01:01.078 --> 00:01:04.260
Caption: without them all so it&#39;s really

00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:07.199
Caption: appreciated I know they they Rock up

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.180
Caption: year after year so yeah really

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:10.379
Caption: appreciate them

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.779
Caption: um so I thought I&#39;d start off with a

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:14.759
Caption: quote architecture represents the

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:17.879
Caption: significant design decisions that shape

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.619
Caption: a system where significance is measured

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:21.478
Caption: by the cost of change

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.880
Caption: and the really important part here for

00:01:21.478 --> 00:01:26.339
Caption: me is that last

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:28.798
Caption: part of the sentence significant is

00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:30.599
Caption: measured by the cost of change these

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.939
Caption: decisions in your architecture diagrams

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:35.339
Caption: in your architecture

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.280
Caption: um you know they have a cost associated

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:40.199
Caption: with them changing them is not as simple

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:42.000
Caption: as just swapping a component now

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:44.519
Caption: generally speaking maybe you&#39;ve got

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.139
Caption: micro services and it is easy but

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:47.758
Caption: generally speaking they&#39;re quite complex

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.978
Caption: tasks

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.759
Caption: um so I really like that quote it&#39;s a

00:01:49.978 --> 00:01:52.459
Caption: great

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.460
Caption: setting

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:58.438
Caption: so on to diagrams whose audience

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.579
Caption: audience participation who&#39;s done a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.899
Caption: diagram before who&#39;s done an

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.240
Caption: architecture one

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.619
Caption: nice how many of you have done it on a

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.599
Caption: whiteboard

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.639
Caption: no external whiteboard yeah how many

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:10.800
Caption: have done like more professional used a

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.059
Caption: bit of software and had to store it in

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.738
Caption: the system where everyone references

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:15.899
Caption: cool so we&#39;re all pretty familiar with

00:02:13.738 --> 00:02:19.139
Caption: architecture diagram sets

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:22.919
Caption: um so some examples uh

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:25.619
Caption: this one lots of boxes barely any labels

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.839
Caption: there&#39;s a bunch of arrows in the middle

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:30.238
Caption: there that are so close together you

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:32.160
Caption: can&#39;t even see where they&#39;re going

00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:33.419
Caption: um I&#39;m probably guilty of doing this at

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.238
Caption: some point in time there&#39;s been some

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:38.039
Caption: complex systems in the past uh

00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:39.899
Caption: but overall you don&#39;t get a great

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:42.539
Caption: picture of what&#39;s going on here there&#39;s

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:45.179
Caption: there&#39;s lots of lots of pretty colors

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:46.799
Caption: and lots of a few arrows but not much

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:49.378
Caption: else to really tell you what this system

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.238
Caption: does or how it behaves

00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:52.679
Caption: uh what about this one

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:54.179
Caption: same sort of thing

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:56.399
Caption: um it&#39;s a little bit more spread out so

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.659
Caption: it&#39;s got that going for it

00:02:56.399 --> 00:03:00.539
Caption: um a bit better use of colors

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.199
Caption: objectively maybe perhaps

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.419
Caption: um

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.979
Caption: a few more labels again perhaps there&#39;s

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.619
Caption: there&#39;s actually a label on one of the

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:09.779
Caption: arrows there which may or may not be

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:11.878
Caption: useful to you but at the end of the day

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.979
Caption: it&#39;s still kind of difficult to see

00:03:11.878 --> 00:03:15.360
Caption: what&#39;s going on with this architecture

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:18.059
Caption: diagram

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.860
Caption: um and then lastly I have this pretty

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:22.139
Caption: whiteboard drawing

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.878
Caption: um this is probably honestly the best

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.238
Caption: out of all of them it&#39;s even got some

00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:29.279
Caption: users in there down the bottom in green

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:31.738
Caption: lots of the the arrows and the data flow

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:33.000
Caption: is actually labeled

00:03:31.738 --> 00:03:34.800
Caption: um

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.199
Caption: but yeah they&#39;re old at the end of the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.180
Caption: day they&#39;re all just boxes that&#39;s boring

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:41.639
Caption: what the hell are these compo what are

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:45.359
Caption: these actual components is it like a an

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:47.878
Caption: ec2 box running uh Java spring boot or

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.979
Caption: is it a Lambda micro service like what&#39;s

00:03:47.878 --> 00:03:51.658
Caption: actually going on in this architecture

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:56.360
Caption: who knows

00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:56.360
Caption: um so stop it don&#39;t do it anymore

00:03:57.298 --> 00:04:00.779
Caption: um

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:03.860
Caption: this is a site that I didn&#39;t delete when

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:06.479
Caption: I was meant to so let&#39;s skip that one uh

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.378
Caption: my purging last night clearly missed a

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.458
Caption: slide

00:04:07.378 --> 00:04:09.598
Caption: um so I wanted to talk through a

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:11.580
Caption: scenario because I thought that was the

00:04:09.598 --> 00:04:13.199
Caption: best way to kind of illustrate how we

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.779
Caption: might go about designing better

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.940
Caption: architecture diagrams so I came up with

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:21.419
Caption: a cannery don&#39;t ask me why my brain

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.919
Caption: works in weird ways uh so products are

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.360
Caption: randomly sampled as they go along the

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.940
Caption: conveyor belt they&#39;re tested for

00:04:24.359 --> 00:04:28.379
Caption: anomalies and we take some action right

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.320
Caption: so there&#39;s there&#39;s something that does

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.600
Caption: that randomly random sampling uh there&#39;s

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.479
Caption: something that detects that random

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.119
Caption: sample event and actually makes a change

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.600
Caption: in the system we have to do something to

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:44.220
Caption: take that sample from the product and

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.380
Caption: then we get results back we get a parcel

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.360
Caption: fail from that sample and again we have

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.639
Caption: to take action

00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:52.559
Caption: um if it fails if it&#39;s good then we

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.259
Caption: continue doing whatever it is a cannery

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:57.479
Caption: does and we profit hopefully

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.279
Caption: uh so

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.619
Caption: this is a plausible architecture right

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:03.899
Caption: it&#39;s not a good one I&#39;ll give you that

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:06.899
Caption: but it&#39;s a plausible architecture we

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:08.759
Caption: have a sensor it&#39;s sending some sort of

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:10.799
Caption: data to a sampling engine there we have

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.979
Caption: a pretty box the box I said don&#39;t do

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:15.239
Caption: because boxes are not good if the sample

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.080
Caption: fails

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:20.819
Caption: it goes around to a staff member

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:23.279
Caption: don&#39;t know what sort of staff member is

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.020
Caption: it the the cleaner or is it the manager

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:28.079
Caption: like who are we actually sending that to

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:29.279
Caption: is it the CEO that gets the message

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:31.319
Caption: um and then

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.519
Caption: the staff member sends something back to

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.899
Caption: the center what are they sending back to

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:35.339
Caption: the sensor

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:38.339
Caption: um there&#39;s not a lot of information

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:39.899
Caption: going on here but

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:41.519
Caption: I can almost guarantee that there&#39;s

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:42.720
Caption: architecture diagrams like this out in

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:43.559
Caption: the wild

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.799
Caption: um

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:49.799
Caption: so all we can oh we can really tell from

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:52.739
Caption: this with any great certainty is that

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:53.940
Caption: when we get sample results back we we do

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:57.660
Caption: something with those sample results

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.639
Caption: right we could see those uh those data

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.100
Caption: flow labels the sample pass and Sample

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.860
Caption: failed that&#39;s the only real certainty we

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.259
Caption: can get out of this architecture diagram

00:06:04.859 --> 00:06:09.119
Caption: um so let&#39;s iterate

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.519
Caption: so now we have a production line we can

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.779
Caption: see what&#39;s actually happening here from

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:15.539
Caption: the production line there&#39;s there&#39;s

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:17.940
Caption: two-way data flow between the random

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:21.059
Caption: sample sensor which has a better name

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.100
Caption: now by the way it&#39;s not just a sensor

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:25.739
Caption: it&#39;s a random sample sensor we&#39;ve got

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.279
Caption: really descriptive

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:30.779
Caption: um labels associated with these things

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:31.859
Caption: uh the random sample sensor we still

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:34.319
Caption: don&#39;t know what it&#39;s doing it&#39;s just

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:36.478
Caption: passing something into a black box

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.119
Caption: sampling engine we we still don&#39;t know

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.160
Caption: what that sampling engine does

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:43.259
Caption: um we can see when it passes we actually

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.539
Caption: go and restart the or restart or

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:47.819
Caption: continue the production line we that

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:50.160
Caption: label might need some work

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:52.679
Caption: um and we can see the manager at some

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.919
Caption: point presses the start button but we

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:58.859
Caption: don&#39;t really know when that is so

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.639
Caption: arguably better maybe worse

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:01.319
Caption: um

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:04.319
Caption: hopefully it illustrates a point though

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:07.139
Caption: so now we can see that we&#39;ve got

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.579
Caption: something generating a sample event we

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:11.520
Caption: we know a bit more about what&#39;s

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:13.019
Caption: happening in this system from from this

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:14.339
Caption: um there&#39;s probably a few other bullet

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:15.720
Caption: points we could include there we know

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:18.660
Caption: that it&#39;s running against a production

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.239
Caption: line we know that it&#39;s a manager that

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.899
Caption: takes action on this system

00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:24.059
Caption: um

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:27.299
Caption: overall we&#39;re starting to get a better

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:29.519
Caption: picture of what this whole system does

00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:31.379
Caption: but we can do better so

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:34.198
Caption: let&#39;s try

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.160
Caption: um so now we have a lot a lot more going

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:36.300
Caption: on here

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.019
Caption: um I try to run through it really

00:07:36.299 --> 00:07:41.698
Caption: quickly for you uh of keynote is we no

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:43.440
Caption: longer have that black box sampling

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:46.619
Caption: engine right we have individual

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:49.080
Caption: components we have an sqs queue we have

00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:52.440
Caption: a Lambda that takes the sample and does

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:55.019
Caption: something with it we have a uh we can

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:58.259
Caption: see that the sample goes and goes

00:07:55.019 --> 00:07:59.339
Caption: through some sort of analyzing system

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:01.799
Caption: um

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:04.619
Caption: don&#39;t know what I&#39;m not a canary manager

00:08:01.799 --> 00:08:06.598
Caption: so don&#39;t ask me uh and then it gets

00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:09.119
Caption: processed by another Lambda so we know

00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:11.399
Caption: instead of that single black box that we

00:08:09.119 --> 00:08:13.319
Caption: thought we had we actually have three

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:15.359
Caption: arguably four different components there

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:18.119
Caption: which is massive amounts more

00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:20.758
Caption: information that we can convey to our

00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:23.579
Caption: our users our stakeholders anyone who&#39;s

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:25.679
Caption: interested in this system brand new devs

00:08:23.579 --> 00:08:28.079
Caption: that join the team you can go oh yeah

00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:31.619
Caption: cool we work with you know two lambdas

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:33.778
Caption: and an sqsq instead of just there&#39;s this

00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:35.940
Caption: black box and you&#39;ll eventually figure

00:08:33.778 --> 00:08:38.700
Caption: out what it does there&#39;s tons more

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.739
Caption: information here uh we can see when it

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.718
Caption: fails we actually send a notification to

00:08:40.739 --> 00:08:45.719
Caption: the manager it just it doesn&#39;t just

00:08:42.718 --> 00:08:48.778
Caption: nebulously somehow get to the manager

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:50.759
Caption: uh who then analyzes the results and

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:52.919
Caption: there&#39;s some subjectivity here clearly

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.440
Caption: because otherwise we wouldn&#39;t need to

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:58.018
Caption: analyze the results the manager probably

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.419
Caption: wouldn&#39;t even need to be involved uh and

00:08:58.018 --> 00:09:01.859
Caption: then you can see that based on analyzing

00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:03.239
Caption: the results they&#39;ll restart the

00:09:01.859 --> 00:09:04.979
Caption: production line perhaps there&#39;s other

00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:06.479
Caption: steps they have to take before they can

00:09:04.979 --> 00:09:09.119
Caption: do that I would assume they have to

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:11.760
Caption: remove the crappy product before they

00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:14.338
Caption: restart it again I don&#39;t actually know

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.000
Caption: how cannery&#39;s work

00:09:14.338 --> 00:09:17.039
Caption: um

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.979
Caption: but that&#39;s the basic premise right we

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:21.898
Caption: want to we want to convey exactly what&#39;s

00:09:19.979 --> 00:09:25.440
Caption: happening in this system

00:09:21.898 --> 00:09:27.599
Caption: uh clear labels for everything your

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.640
Caption: components it&#39;s not just a Lambda it&#39;s a

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:32.518
Caption: Lambda that takes a sample it&#39;s a Lambda

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.559
Caption: that processes sample results it&#39;s very

00:09:32.518 --> 00:09:36.539
Caption: clear what those individual components

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:37.979
Caption: are doing

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:39.898
Caption: um

00:09:37.979 --> 00:09:41.760
Caption: and that then helps you to convey

00:09:39.898 --> 00:09:43.260
Caption: meaning to the rest of the people

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.179
Caption: involved in the project

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.979
Caption: so uh

00:09:45.179 --> 00:09:49.080
Caption: this is a real world example this is

00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:51.479
Caption: something that I used

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:55.019
Caption: um at a at a client this is actually

00:09:51.479 --> 00:09:57.898
Caption: part of a smaller bit of a smaller part

00:09:55.018 --> 00:09:59.880
Caption: of a larger architecture so this is one

00:09:57.898 --> 00:10:03.599
Caption: component out of

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:05.518
Caption: four six there was multiple vpcs peering

00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:07.619
Caption: going on

00:10:05.518 --> 00:10:10.919
Caption: and it was all Illustrated in the

00:10:07.619 --> 00:10:12.359
Caption: diagram we I used a little pipe symbol

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:15.239
Caption: to indicate that there was peering

00:10:12.359 --> 00:10:17.159
Caption: between the various vpcs

00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:18.778
Caption: um you know use your imagination here

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:21.778
Caption: use some descript some something

00:10:18.778 --> 00:10:24.659
Caption: descriptive that&#39;s not just a box and an

00:10:21.778 --> 00:10:26.219
Caption: arrow to get your point across in this

00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:28.679
Caption: particular case we&#39;re talking about a

00:10:26.219 --> 00:10:30.958
Caption: step function you can see we&#39;re using

00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:33.599
Caption: the diamonds to indicate decision points

00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:35.880
Caption: in the process the

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:37.699
Caption: gray box I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s great it&#39;s gray

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.979
Caption: on my screen a bit in the middle there

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:45.059
Caption: with the map states is actually a

00:10:40.979 --> 00:10:46.859
Caption: parallel state where it takes multiple

00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:47.940
Caption: results and Spins up multiple lambdas

00:10:46.859 --> 00:10:50.299
Caption: concurrently

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:52.739
Caption: uh not sure that&#39;s the best

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:54.479
Caption: representation but at least it gets the

00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:56.159
Caption: point across that something different is

00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:58.018
Caption: happening at that particular part of the

00:10:56.159 --> 00:11:00.179
Caption: process which is the goal here is we

00:10:58.018 --> 00:11:02.278
Caption: want to communicate exactly what&#39;s

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:04.320
Caption: happening and you can start a discussion

00:11:02.278 --> 00:11:06.539
Caption: around that point you can go hey product

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.398
Caption: owner we&#39;re actually spinning up 20

00:11:06.539 --> 00:11:10.320
Caption: lambdas here right this is very

00:11:08.398 --> 00:11:11.578
Caption: different to just spinning up one Lambda

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.220
Caption: they&#39;re all processing things

00:11:11.578 --> 00:11:16.679
Caption: concurrently and we have to take certain

00:11:14.219 --> 00:11:17.398
Caption: actions as a result

00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:19.859
Caption: um

00:11:17.398 --> 00:11:22.859
Caption: down the bottom you&#39;ve got external

00:11:19.859 --> 00:11:24.419
Caption: Integrations with mulesoft that&#39;s as far

00:11:22.859 --> 00:11:26.278
Caption: as I went with this particular diagram

00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:28.919
Caption: you could go further the mulesoft

00:11:26.278 --> 00:11:32.219
Caption: actually pointed it at sap whether that

00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:35.299
Caption: adds value or not is is up to you the

00:11:32.219 --> 00:11:38.099
Caption: one thing this doesn&#39;t include is people

00:11:35.299 --> 00:11:39.898
Caption: uh that said this system doesn&#39;t

00:11:38.099 --> 00:11:41.940
Caption: actually really have people in the

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:43.859
Caption: process it&#39;s a fully automated system so

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.958
Caption: perhaps not the best example but I

00:11:43.859 --> 00:11:49.500
Caption: thought it would be interesting to

00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:51.200
Caption: include include a more beefier example

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.099
Caption: of what I&#39;m

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.140
Caption: trying to

00:11:53.099 --> 00:12:00.179
Caption: get across here

00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:02.338
Caption: uh cool I&#39;m going really quick of course

00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:05.099
Caption: so look you see really quick that&#39;s

00:12:02.338 --> 00:12:08.039
Caption: that&#39;s basically the end of my talk so

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:10.380
Caption: um the key takeaways here are build

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:13.018
Caption: Build architecture design architecture

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.700
Caption: that includes everyone don&#39;t build these

00:12:13.018 --> 00:12:17.760
Caption: little black boxes that only the

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:20.220
Caption: technical experts understand you lose so

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.540
Caption: much value your your POS they don&#39;t know

00:12:20.219 --> 00:12:23.759
Caption: what&#39;s going on with these little black

00:12:21.539 --> 00:12:25.979
Caption: boxes you tell them there&#39;s a Lambda

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.320
Caption: that&#39;s doing something instantly they go

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:30.119
Caption: oh cool I actually understand what that

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.160
Caption: is you might have to explain them how a

00:12:30.119 --> 00:12:33.659
Caption: lambd explained to them how a Lambda

00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:35.159
Caption: works but they&#39;re going to feel more

00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:36.359
Caption: connected to the project they&#39;re going

00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:38.518
Caption: to be more interested in what&#39;s

00:12:36.359 --> 00:12:41.958
Caption: happening I&#39;ve seen it time and time

00:12:38.518 --> 00:12:44.458
Caption: again the good POS even the mediocre POS

00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:47.700
Caption: they are way more involved in the

00:12:44.458 --> 00:12:50.578
Caption: process if you encourage them and

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.018
Caption: include them in the whole thing they

00:12:50.578 --> 00:12:53.398
Caption: want to be involved in this at the end

00:12:52.018 --> 00:12:55.440
Caption: of the day that&#39;s their product right

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:57.898
Caption: they they want to know what&#39;s happening

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.720
Caption: with their product they are the owners

00:12:57.898 --> 00:13:03.599
Caption: so really encourage them

00:13:00.719 --> 00:13:05.819
Caption: to to get involved in this process and

00:13:03.599 --> 00:13:09.359
Caption: build a process build a build a diagram

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.078
Caption: that does encourage them to do so

00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:11.760
Caption: um

00:13:10.078 --> 00:13:14.278
Caption: things that will help you do this single

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.799
Caption: responsibility principle right that

00:13:14.278 --> 00:13:19.559
Caption: single black box was split into two

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:21.539
Caption: lambdas and a queue and they all did one

00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:22.799
Caption: thing there was a Lambda that took a

00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:24.299
Caption: sample

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:26.760
Caption: um I don&#39;t know how that works on a

00:13:24.299 --> 00:13:29.398
Caption: cannery Factory maybe they activate a

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.139
Caption: different conveyor belt who knows but it

00:13:29.398 --> 00:13:33.659
Caption: that&#39;s all it does it just takes a

00:13:31.138 --> 00:13:35.699
Caption: sample when it responds to that random

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:38.219
Caption: sampling event and then the other Lambda

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.958
Caption: that processes the results and says it&#39;s

00:13:38.219 --> 00:13:41.638
Caption: a pass or a fail right that&#39;s all it

00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:44.638
Caption: does it figures out whether the results

00:13:41.638 --> 00:13:47.578
Caption: are a pass or a fail it is very simple

00:13:44.638 --> 00:13:49.679
Caption: architecture it&#39;s easy to understand

00:13:47.578 --> 00:13:51.119
Caption: and everybody can understand it which is

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:54.119
Caption: the whole point we want people to

00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:56.278
Caption: understand we want people to go oh can I

00:13:54.119 --> 00:13:59.398
Caption: add this particular component what&#39;s the

00:13:56.278 --> 00:14:01.619
Caption: impact of this particular feature or

00:13:59.398 --> 00:14:03.778
Caption: change to the system and if they

00:14:01.619 --> 00:14:05.518
Caption: understand the whole system they&#39;re

00:14:03.778 --> 00:14:07.078
Caption: going to be able to have more of a

00:14:05.518 --> 00:14:08.898
Caption: meaningful discussion with you about

00:14:07.078 --> 00:14:11.159
Caption: that

00:14:08.898 --> 00:14:13.260
Caption: readability and discoverability I

00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:16.379
Caption: mentioned earlier in the talk new devs

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:19.859
Caption: new devs are going to understand

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:23.700
Caption: this a lot quicker than if I just did

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:25.440
Caption: that black box outside or maybe the the

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.480
Caption: um event bridge and the step function

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.898
Caption: right having all the individual

00:14:27.479 --> 00:14:32.638
Caption: components is going to be way easier to

00:14:30.898 --> 00:14:33.719
Caption: understand and get them up to speed and

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:35.398
Caption: that&#39;s what we want right we don&#39;t want

00:14:33.719 --> 00:14:36.898
Caption: to have to spend a month teaching the

00:14:35.398 --> 00:14:39.239
Caption: new Dev all the different parts of the

00:14:36.898 --> 00:14:41.638
Caption: system we&#39;re going to go hey we need to

00:14:39.239 --> 00:14:42.958
Caption: make this change to Lambda XYZ go make

00:14:41.638 --> 00:14:46.679
Caption: that change and they can go do it

00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:49.198
Caption: without any other involvement so

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:51.000
Caption: it&#39;s a really great way of onboarding

00:14:49.198 --> 00:14:52.799
Caption: people quick and everyone getting up to

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.900
Caption: speed and everyone understanding the

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:54.539
Caption: system

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.199
Caption: [Music]

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:56.880
Caption: um

00:14:55.198 --> 00:14:58.500
Caption: and the last thing I&#39;ve kind of already

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.299
Caption: touched on this opportunity to enhance

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.500
Caption: your workflow right you&#39;re not always

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:03.239
Caption: going to see everything just because

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.159
Caption: you&#39;re the architect doesn&#39;t mean you

00:15:03.239 --> 00:15:07.380
Caption: always know best just because you&#39;re the

00:15:05.159 --> 00:15:10.018
Caption: senior Dev or the tech lead just because

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.359
Caption: you&#39;re the PO doesn&#39;t mean you know the

00:15:10.018 --> 00:15:14.820
Caption: best workflow here by having an

00:15:12.359 --> 00:15:17.099
Caption: architecture that everybody understands

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:20.160
Caption: you can all work together and spot

00:15:17.099 --> 00:15:22.679
Caption: opportunities to improve the workflow to

00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:25.859
Caption: enhance the workflow to add new business

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:26.760
Caption: cases and value to that workflow

00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:29.820
Caption: um

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:32.100
Caption: and that&#39;s it that&#39;s me so uh thank you

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.359
Caption: very much for coming to my tour and

00:15:32.099 --> 00:15:40.768
Caption: question time

00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:40.768
Caption: [Applause]

00:15:40.859 --> 00:15:46.859
Caption: sorry thank you very much Trent so it&#39;s

00:15:44.698 --> 00:15:48.419
Caption: not only about making inclusive software

00:15:46.859 --> 00:15:51.239
Caption: for your customers it&#39;s about making

00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:53.039
Caption: inclusive systems so you can basically

00:15:51.239 --> 00:15:54.838
Caption: communicate better with the team of

00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:57.719
Caption: people that you&#39;re working with all the

00:15:54.838 --> 00:16:00.359
Caption: way through from exec to um your Junior

00:15:57.719 --> 00:16:01.859
Caption: developer very good thank you now we&#39;re

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:05.479
Caption: going to open the floor up for some q

00:16:01.859 --> 00:16:05.479
Caption: and A&#39;s uh has anyone got a question

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.018
Caption: just up the front

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:18.419
Caption: possibly a loaded question

00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:21.059
Caption: um have you have you heard of the C4

00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:22.440
Caption: model of architecture diagrams recently

00:16:21.059 --> 00:16:24.778
Caption: yes yes okay

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.198
Caption: um yeah very similar I I considered

00:16:24.778 --> 00:16:30.419
Caption: adding that to this talk and you could

00:16:27.198 --> 00:16:32.278
Caption: uh if we look at uh say this particular

00:16:30.419 --> 00:16:34.260
Caption: model you could you could probably apply

00:16:32.278 --> 00:16:36.778
Caption: that here and say the um you know the

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:39.059
Caption: two big black boxes are one level of the

00:16:36.778 --> 00:16:41.698
Caption: C4 and then you drill down another level

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:43.320
Caption: and you get a a view of the uh event

00:16:41.698 --> 00:16:44.940
Caption: bridge and the step function and the

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.679
Caption: database and then another level when you

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.539
Caption: get the internals of the step function

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:53.219
Caption: and that would apply there

00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:54.719
Caption: um but yeah uh organically came to the

00:16:53.219 --> 00:16:55.919
Caption: same conclusions apparently I only

00:16:54.719 --> 00:16:57.799
Caption: discovered it in the last couple of

00:16:55.919 --> 00:17:00.000
Caption: months you&#39;ve reinvented it

00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:01.979
Caption: we discovered it ourselves about a year

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.678
Caption: ago oh nice yeah how&#39;s it working for

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:06.599
Caption: you that&#39;s brilliant nice excellent

00:17:04.678 --> 00:17:08.938
Caption: yeah it&#39;s basically what you showed

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:11.578
Caption: there it really opens up the magic Black

00:17:08.938 --> 00:17:13.318
Caption: Box yeah um

00:17:11.578 --> 00:17:15.479
Caption: and uh yeah more people can understand

00:17:13.318 --> 00:17:16.859
Caption: the system yeah great once you do that

00:17:15.479 --> 00:17:20.280
Caption: more people can go oh hang on actually

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:21.780
Caption: it&#39;s a bit crap yeah yeah yeah it leads

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.338
Caption: leads to an improved system though when

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:26.280
Caption: they say that right so yeah it&#39;s good

00:17:23.338 --> 00:17:29.719
Caption: cool thank you

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.719
Caption: any more questions any more questions

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.880
Caption: um have you got any advice for people

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.919
Caption: who are reviewing someone else&#39;s

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.479
Caption: architecture diagram any sort of red

00:17:37.918 --> 00:17:42.269
Caption: flags to look out for and that sort of

00:17:39.479 --> 00:17:45.119
Caption: thing oh yeah that&#39;s a good one no boxes

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:49.320
Caption: [Laughter]

00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:50.760
Caption: um yeah look I uh

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:54.659
Caption: uh I can&#39;t think of anything off the top

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:57.178
Caption: I&#39;ve not done a lot of reviews right I

00:17:54.660 --> 00:18:00.599
Caption: um I tend to either pick something up

00:17:57.178 --> 00:18:02.459
Caption: and uh try and figure out what&#39;s going

00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:04.798
Caption: on or I&#39;ll be building the diagram

00:18:02.459 --> 00:18:08.699
Caption: myself I guess the only thing I would

00:18:04.798 --> 00:18:10.859
Caption: perhaps consider when doing a review is

00:18:08.699 --> 00:18:12.599
Caption: maybe build it yourself do the diagram

00:18:10.859 --> 00:18:15.239
Caption: yourself and see what the differences

00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:17.660
Caption: are and make sure that you have actually

00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:19.918
Caption: captured all the aspects of the system

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:23.220
Caption: might be a good way of doing it but yeah

00:18:19.918 --> 00:18:26.839
Caption: I&#39;ve never done reviews before so that&#39;s

00:18:23.219 --> 00:18:26.839
Caption: um purely guesswork unfortunately

00:18:27.479 --> 00:18:30.140
Caption: any more questions

00:18:38.819 --> 00:18:44.339
Caption: um are there any particular tools that

00:18:42.479 --> 00:18:47.538
Caption: you found sort of helpful or useful in

00:18:44.339 --> 00:18:50.819
Caption: terms of your architecture diagrams

00:18:47.538 --> 00:18:52.439
Caption: uh yeah look I mean there&#39;s definitely

00:18:50.819 --> 00:18:54.178
Caption: tools out there that will generate a lot

00:18:52.439 --> 00:18:56.279
Caption: of this stuff for you

00:18:54.178 --> 00:18:57.599
Caption: um there was

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.039
Caption: I can&#39;t remember the name of it there

00:18:57.599 --> 00:19:01.678
Caption: was a recent one that works really well

00:18:59.038 --> 00:19:03.479
Caption: with arm templates and and the Azure

00:19:01.678 --> 00:19:06.538
Caption: system I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s

00:19:03.479 --> 00:19:09.119
Caption: equivalent for AWS uh these particular

00:19:06.538 --> 00:19:11.699
Caption: diet or the um the big real world

00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:13.199
Caption: diagram I did that in sorry I just

00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:16.798
Caption: realized I&#39;m not on the screen it&#39;s

00:19:13.199 --> 00:19:19.439
Caption: there uh the big real world diagram I

00:19:16.798 --> 00:19:21.239
Caption: did that in Vizio uh it has all the nice

00:19:19.439 --> 00:19:23.939
Caption: icons and everything else to work with

00:19:21.239 --> 00:19:27.298
Caption: whatever platform you&#39;re using but

00:19:23.939 --> 00:19:30.058
Caption: drawer IO as well free open source has

00:19:27.298 --> 00:19:32.339
Caption: same set of pitches and diagrams and

00:19:30.058 --> 00:19:34.500
Caption: everything else and you can sync it to

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:37.558
Caption: Dropbox and OneDrive and all the rest

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:39.380
Caption: and and they&#39;re really useful tools

00:19:37.558 --> 00:19:42.000
Caption: um

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.739
Caption: I haven&#39;t used Lucid but I do I do know

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.400
Caption: of lucid yeah yeah

00:19:43.739 --> 00:19:46.739
Caption: um

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.039
Caption: yeah they&#39;re they&#39;re the most tools I

00:19:46.739 --> 00:19:49.038
Caption: know about

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.539
