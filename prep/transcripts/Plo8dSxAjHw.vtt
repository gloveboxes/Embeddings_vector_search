00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.279
Caption: originally called this

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.960
Caption: refactoring components and then one of

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:07.039
Caption: my co-workers pointed out that that was

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.638
Caption: pretty boring and i was missing out an

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:11.039
Caption: opportunity to go

00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:13.598
Caption: getting on the refactor tractor

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.519
Caption: so that&#39;s what we&#39;re going with

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:18.559
Caption: um

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.479
Caption: my name is erin i work for the company

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:22.239
Caption: formerly known as square

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:23.518
Caption: which is now known as block and i

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.278
Caption: specifically work building a product

00:00:23.518 --> 00:00:27.118
Caption: called cash up which you may not have

00:00:25.278 --> 00:00:29.278
Caption: heard of because it&#39;s not currently

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:31.920
Caption: available in australia but our aim is

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:34.078
Caption: basically to fix the truly atrocious

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.680
Caption: situation that is the banking sector in

00:00:34.078 --> 00:00:39.199
Caption: the us you think we&#39;ve got it bad here

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.959
Caption: um but we do have offices here in

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.479
Caption: australia and we are very remote

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:44.799
Caption: friendly so if you&#39;re looking for a

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:47.039
Caption: change maybe come have a chat

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:49.038
Caption: um like i said i will have my knitting

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.319
Caption: needles around i i&#39;ll be knitting socks

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.920
Caption: because

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:53.439
Caption: this year i decided for some reason i

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:55.279
Caption: was going to knit everyone&#39;s socks for

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:56.959
Caption: christmas um so now i&#39;m going to knit

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:58.718
Caption: like 10 pairs of socks by the end of the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:00.878
Caption: year and there&#39;s no like

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.399
Caption: no going back from that yet right

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.159
Caption: i&#39;m stuck

00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:06.319
Caption: um and if you would like to follow along

00:01:04.158 --> 00:01:08.879
Caption: uh at home these slides are available at

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:10.400
Caption: refactortractor.ez.codes

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:13.438
Caption: and they really are there this time not

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.479
Caption: like at the last talk i gave

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.840
Caption: all right so today we&#39;re going to talk

00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:18.478
Caption: about refactoring we&#39;re going to start

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:19.758
Caption: with factoring is and when we might want

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.519
Caption: to do it

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.000
Caption: we&#39;re going to look at some occupational

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:25.519
Caption: health and safety so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.879
Caption: some tools that we can use to ensure

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:30.000
Caption: that our refactoring happens safely

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:31.438
Caption: we&#39;re going to look at some additional

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.959
Caption: tools we&#39;ve got available for working

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.040
Caption: with jsx

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.360
Caption: and we&#39;re going to do lots of live

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.239
Caption: examples because i like living

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.479
Caption: dangerously

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:43.839
Caption: all right so what is refactoring uh

00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:45.919
Caption: refactoring is when we change the

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:47.359
Caption: implementation without changing the

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:49.040
Caption: functionality right so we&#39;re changing

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.919
Caption: the code but we&#39;re not changing what it

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.919
Caption: does

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:53.360
Caption: there&#39;s a few reasons we might do that

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:54.478
Caption: we might want to make the code easier to

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.079
Caption: understand

00:01:54.478 --> 00:01:57.599
Caption: we might want to wait want to make it

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.200
Caption: easier to test

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.599
Caption: or mostly we want to make it easier to

00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:01.599
Caption: change

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.200
Caption: um so

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.719
Caption: some things that we might do while we&#39;re

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:08.319
Caption: refactoring are things like renaming

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.440
Caption: variables right maybe the variable names

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.440
Caption: we&#39;ve got out of sync with what&#39;s

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.119
Caption: actually going on and the cut the code

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.319
Caption: is hard to understand rename the

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:15.839
Caption: variables make it a bit easier to

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.759
Caption: understand

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:19.360
Caption: we might take long functions and split

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.958
Caption: them up into smaller functions which

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.160
Caption: also makes the code easier to understand

00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.679
Caption: because it&#39;s easier to reason about the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.598
Caption: smaller pieces

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:27.439
Caption: as well as making it easier to test

00:02:25.598 --> 00:02:29.279
Caption: because we can test the parts

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.559
Caption: independently

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.399
Caption: and we might do things like we&#39;ve got

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:34.080
Caption: some repeated code we might

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:35.679
Caption: factor it out so it&#39;s just in one place

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.040
Caption: which makes it easier to change right

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:39.598
Caption: it&#39;s going to have to change it in one

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:39.598
Caption: place later

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:43.360
Caption: if you&#39;re interested in this kind of

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.598
Caption: nitty-gritty details of refactoring i

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.919
Caption: highly recommend that you check out

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:49.598
Caption: martin fowler&#39;s book refactoring um he&#39;s

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.399
Caption: got like a whole taxonomy there like the

00:02:49.598 --> 00:02:51.839
Caption: different

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.598
Caption: always like the different moves that you

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:55.440
Caption: can make in refactoring and like how to

00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:56.720
Caption: do them and all like when you might want

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.680
Caption: to do those different things but we&#39;re

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.639
Caption: not going to get into quite that

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:02.479
Caption: nitty-gritty detail today

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.119
Caption: okay so now we know what refactoring is

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.639
Caption: when should we do it um and my sort of

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:09.279
Caption: cop-out answer is

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.759
Caption: when the benefits outweigh the costs um

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:14.080
Caption: and i say that&#39;s a common answer because

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:16.319
Caption: that&#39;s when you do anything right when

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.000
Caption: the benefits outweigh the costs

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.679
Caption: so what are the benefits and the costs

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Caption: of refactoring

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:23.839
Caption: so the benefits of refactoring uh most

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.839
Caption: importantly the biggest benefit you&#39;re

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.878
Caption: going to get from it is faster future

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.878
Caption: development

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:30.479
Caption: right if you spend some time refactoring

00:03:28.878 --> 00:03:32.559
Caption: your currencies it&#39;s easier to build

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.238
Caption: chain to build things change things fix

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:36.238
Caption: bugs later on that&#39;s a huge benefit of

00:03:34.238 --> 00:03:39.039
Caption: refactoring

00:03:36.238 --> 00:03:41.039
Caption: refraction also often leads to less bugs

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.878
Caption: if we&#39;re making code that&#39;s easier to

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.479
Caption: test then it&#39;s easier to find the bugs

00:03:42.878 --> 00:03:45.839
Caption: that we do put in there but also if

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.119
Caption: we&#39;re making our code easy to understand

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:49.518
Caption: we&#39;re less likely to put the bugs in

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.798
Caption: there in the first place

00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:52.559
Caption: and finally

00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:54.238
Caption: refactoring is a lot of fun

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.199
Caption: i don&#39;t know about you but i get a real

00:03:54.238 --> 00:03:57.679
Caption: thrill

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.720
Caption: out of um taking some code that&#39;s a huge

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:00.639
Caption: big mess

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.559
Caption: and cleaning it all up

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:06.878
Caption: um but maybe that&#39;s just me i don&#39;t know

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:08.958
Caption: there are some costs though the biggest

00:04:06.878 --> 00:04:11.360
Caption: cost of refactoring is time

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.878
Caption: if we spent a day refactoring our code

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.039
Caption: and that&#39;s a day that we&#39;re not spending

00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:16.720
Caption: building new features or fixing existing

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.000
Caption: bugs right so we need to take that into

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.720
Caption: account we need to make sure that that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.359
Caption: trade-off exists

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.600
Caption: and there&#39;s also some risks with factory

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:27.679
Caption: so i found this delightful haiku on

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.360
Caption: twitter by another person named erin i

00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:30.959
Caption: was pretty happy to see

00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:32.719
Caption: um and she says

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:35.199
Caption: this courage used to work

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.000
Caption: hey i should refactor it

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.679
Caption: now

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Caption: it does not work

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:41.199
Caption: which i found very relatable

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.799
Caption: um

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.239
Caption: she was a woman on twitter so obviously

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:45.918
Caption: what she got was a bunch of men telling

00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:47.759
Caption: her that she should just different

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.800
Caption: better tests

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.959
Caption: um

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:52.799
Caption: which is easy to say but it can be quite

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:55.519
Caption: difficult right it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to write

00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:56.959
Caption: tests for code when you don&#39;t

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:58.399
Caption: know what it was intending to do in the

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:59.679
Caption: first place right it&#39;s quite tricky to

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.959
Caption: write those tests

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:02.720
Caption: and also when you are writing those

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:05.519
Caption: tests often you&#39;ll pick up existing bugs

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.119
Caption: in the code and sort of you can&#39;t just

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:08.720
Caption: go around fixing them

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:10.000
Caption: because often

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.440
Caption: like if you&#39;ve got bugs in your code

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.959
Caption: your users might have workarounds that

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.399
Caption: they&#39;ve built to deal with those bugs

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:16.799
Caption: when you fix the bugs you&#39;re going to

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:19.359
Caption: break those workarounds um the best sort

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:21.359
Caption: of example i can think of with really

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:22.719
Caption: regards to that is internet explorer

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:26.000
Caption: which was basically

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.000
Caption: one big bug but

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.759
Caption: the way that it was written if microsoft

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.359
Caption: had gone in and fixed all of the bugs in

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.119
Caption: internet explorer it would have broken

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:34.638
Caption: millions of websites around the world

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:36.880
Caption: right so

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.199
Caption: ie had its issues but they their hands

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.360
Caption: were tied to some degree about the buggy

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.919
Caption: behavior

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:46.399
Caption: okay so as an example of some code that

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.600
Caption: i did not refactor this piece of code

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:49.600
Caption: comes from a code base that i was

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.039
Caption: working on last year um it was in this

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.119
Caption: component it&#39;s like a huge component

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.880
Caption: like a thousand lines long

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:56.559
Caption: favorite

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.000
Caption: and i was working in a different part of

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:01.039
Caption: the component that this particular

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.720
Caption: function now i hate this function this

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.399
Caption: this upsets me immensely this should be

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.360
Caption: like three lines of code there is no

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:09.600
Caption: need for any of this but it also worth

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:11.839
Caption: refactoring it like i wasn&#39;t doing

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.880
Caption: anything with a bit of code but also it

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:15.199
Caption: works

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.479
Caption: it&#39;s easy to understand it&#39;s easy to

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.239
Caption: test

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.679
Caption: apart from the way that it annoys me

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:21.759
Caption: there&#39;s not really anything wrong with

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:23.759
Caption: it so i never didn&#39;t didn&#39;t touch it

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.679
Caption: resisted the urge as far as i know it&#39;s

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.839
Caption: still in the code base but i don&#39;t have

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:29.279
Caption: to look at it anymore

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:31.279
Caption: okay so as a general rule i only

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.199
Caption: refactor code if

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:34.799
Caption: i&#39;m doing some change some other change

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.119
Caption: at the same time or someone else in my

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:39.519
Caption: team is doing some other change so that

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:40.559
Caption: has the advantage that first of all i

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:42.239
Caption: know that

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:43.759
Caption: the refactor is going to be worthwhile

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:45.359
Caption: because it is going to speed up the

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.639
Caption: feature work that i&#39;m doing

00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:48.079
Caption: but also it means that there&#39;s a bunch

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.600
Caption: of people with their eyes on this code

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:51.359
Caption: at the moment right the other people in

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.759
Caption: my team our product managers our

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:55.119
Caption: designers everyone&#39;s looking at

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.039
Caption: what&#39;s going on in this part of the code

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:58.479
Caption: base our users are expecting a change

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:59.839
Caption: anyway there&#39;s a better chance that if i

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.679
Caption: do accidentally break something or

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.880
Caption: accidentally fix something that

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:04.319
Caption: somebody&#39;s get somebody&#39;s going to

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.479
Caption: notice and we can deal with it

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.440
Caption: appropriately

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:08.880
Caption: okay

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.399
Caption: so

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.360
Caption: we&#39;ve sat down we&#39;ve made our decision

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:13.839
Caption: and we&#39;ve decided we&#39;re going to

00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:15.598
Caption: refactor some code

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:17.199
Caption: the particular effect of the specific

00:07:15.598 --> 00:07:19.598
Caption: refactor we&#39;re going to do is our code

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:21.360
Caption: base is using moment.js for handling

00:07:19.598 --> 00:07:23.519
Caption: date times

00:07:21.359 --> 00:07:25.758
Caption: moment.js was an absolutely fantastic

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:28.000
Caption: library for managing dates and times in

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.559
Caption: javascript when it was invented i think

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.880
Caption: 10 years ago but these days it&#39;s a

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:34.319
Caption: little bit heavy weight it&#39;s got uses

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.720
Caption: mutable dates which sort of result in

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:38.160
Caption: bugs and the managers at moment also

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.519
Caption: suggest that perhaps moment is not the

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.919
Caption: library to be using for you so we&#39;ve

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:44.879
Caption: decided that we&#39;re going to switch to

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:47.199
Caption: date functions date fns

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.720
Caption: and the specific code

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:51.199
Caption: is this function here

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.440
Caption: so it&#39;s a function which formats a date

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:55.119
Caption: takes a date if the date is falsy it

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.959
Caption: returns an empty string

00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:58.959
Caption: otherwise it&#39;s user&#39;s moment

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:14.160
Caption: behavior is

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:15.519
Caption: then we&#39;re going to refactor the code

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.959
Caption: and then we&#39;re going to write our

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:18.638
Caption: feature and we&#39;re not going to do step

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:20.479
Caption: three today because i&#39;m assuming you are

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:22.000
Caption: all already really great at writing new

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:25.360
Caption: features and we&#39;re just going to

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.878
Caption: concentrate on the first two steps

00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:28.799
Caption: so the way that we&#39;re going to determine

00:08:26.878 --> 00:08:30.878
Caption: the current behavior is using something

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:33.039
Caption: called characterization tests so

00:08:30.878 --> 00:08:35.039
Caption: characterization tests come from a book

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:37.518
Caption: called working effectively with legacy

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:40.158
Caption: code by michael feathers

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:42.079
Caption: if you do work with legacy code and you

00:08:40.158 --> 00:08:43.598
Caption: would like to do it effectively this

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.320
Caption: could be the book for you

00:08:43.598 --> 00:08:45.359
Caption: but

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.440
Caption: today we&#39;re just going to talk about

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:49.760
Caption: characterization tests

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.039
Caption: so characterization tests work a little

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.000
Caption: bit differently to the tests that you

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:53.440
Caption: would normally write when you&#39;re

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.799
Caption: building a feature so when you&#39;re

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.760
Caption: normally building a feature what you

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:56.958
Caption: would do

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.200
Caption: is you would write a test with some

00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.559
Caption: expectations

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.838
Caption: and then you write the code to make the

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:03.518
Caption: test pass

00:09:01.838 --> 00:09:04.958
Caption: assuming you&#39;re doing tdd i don&#39;t know

00:09:03.518 --> 00:09:06.239
Caption: if you don&#39;t do tdd i guess you write

00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.200
Caption: the test you write the code then you

00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:09.359
Caption: write the test and you realize the

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.559
Caption: code&#39;s wrong you go back change the code

00:09:09.359 --> 00:09:12.640
Caption: wonder why you didn&#39;t just write tests

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:14.479
Caption: first i don&#39;t know

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.799
Caption: a characterization test though is the

00:09:14.479 --> 00:09:19.599
Caption: other sort of way around i guess we

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:21.760
Caption: write a test with no expectations

00:09:19.599 --> 00:09:23.599
Caption: and then we change the test until the

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.200
Caption: expect we change the expectations until

00:09:23.599 --> 00:09:27.518
Caption: the test passes

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.200
Caption: so with feature tests the code changes

00:09:27.518 --> 00:09:30.958
Caption: but the test stays the same with

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.040
Caption: characterization tests the tests change

00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:34.559
Caption: but the code stays the same the most

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:35.919
Caption: important thing is that we&#39;re only ever

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:37.200
Caption: changing one or the other right you&#39;re

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:40.398
Caption: either changing the code or you&#39;re

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.040
Caption: changing the test never both at once

00:09:40.398 --> 00:09:45.919
Caption: so what does that look like

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:45.919
Caption: oh wrong way

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.679
Caption: uh here we have can everybody see that

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.440
Caption: because

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:52.958
Caption: yeah cool because i can&#39;t make it any

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.640
Caption: bigger than that i don&#39;t think

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.159
Caption: so that&#39;s lucky

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.519
Caption: so we have our function here and we&#39;re

00:09:56.159 --> 00:09:59.359
Caption: ready to write some tests for it so

00:09:57.518 --> 00:10:01.760
Caption: we&#39;re going to describe our format date

00:09:59.359 --> 00:10:01.760
Caption: function

00:10:02.479 --> 00:10:07.919
Caption: now uh when i&#39;m writing tests i like to

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:11.838
Caption: start with the very simplest case

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:14.000
Caption: so when we pass in nothing

00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:16.000
Caption: and what&#39;s going to happen then

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.599
Caption: it&#39;s and this is a characterization test

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.039
Caption: right so we don&#39;t know what it&#39;s going

00:10:17.599 --> 00:10:22.559
Caption: to do i guess it&#39;s going to return

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:24.799
Caption: something returns we don&#39;t know

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:25.919
Caption: and then we can write the actual test is

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:27.518
Caption: going to be

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:28.559
Caption: expect

00:10:27.518 --> 00:10:29.440
Caption: format

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:31.119
Caption: date

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.880
Caption: passed in nothing

00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:34.640
Caption: to be

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.398
Caption: and again we don&#39;t know

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.720
Caption: so what happens when we run the test we

00:10:36.398 --> 00:10:40.479
Caption: can see that it fails because i guess

00:10:38.719 --> 00:10:42.559
Caption: unsurprisingly

00:10:40.479 --> 00:10:44.000
Caption: our date function doesn&#39;t return two

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:45.200
Caption: question marks

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.958
Caption: and we can see that what it does return

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.958
Caption: is an empty string so now we can update

00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.719
Caption: our test and say it returns an

00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.679
Caption: empty string

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:54.879
Caption: and

00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:57.200
Caption: the test and now the test passes

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.078
Caption: okay so then we can do that for our

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.760
Caption: other

00:10:58.078 --> 00:11:01.518
Caption: scenarios

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.720
Caption: so the next one is going to be when we

00:11:01.518 --> 00:11:04.639
Caption: pass in

00:11:02.719 --> 00:11:05.759
Caption: uh date so the things that we can pass

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.239
Caption: into this function are sort of

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.000
Caption: determined by what you can pass into the

00:11:08.239 --> 00:11:13.278
Caption: date constructor so it&#39;s going to be a

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.039
Caption: date a string or a number

00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:16.799
Caption: so we can pass on a date

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:18.239
Caption: um again we don&#39;t know what it&#39;s going

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:20.559
Caption: to return

00:11:18.239 --> 00:11:22.078
Caption: um we&#39;ll pass a new date when i&#39;m doing

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:24.159
Caption: this kind of thing i like to use dates

00:11:22.078 --> 00:11:25.919
Caption: that i like have all the numbers below

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:28.719
Caption: 10 so that we can see where the padding

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:31.359
Caption: is going to end up

00:11:28.719 --> 00:11:35.039
Caption: and we can see that fails because it

00:11:31.359 --> 00:11:35.039
Caption: returns this formatted string

00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:41.119
Caption: so we can say it returns a formatted

00:11:39.119 --> 00:11:44.078
Caption: date i guess

00:11:41.119 --> 00:11:46.398
Caption: um cool so that&#39;s our date scenario and

00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:48.880
Caption: then we have the strings

00:11:46.398 --> 00:11:50.880
Caption: so when we pass in a

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.119
Caption: so with strings there&#39;s kind of three

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.559
Caption: scenarios that we can have here the

00:11:53.119 --> 00:11:56.159
Caption: first is that we can have a valid date

00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:58.078
Caption: string

00:11:56.159 --> 00:11:59.919
Caption: which is just going to look like

00:11:58.078 --> 00:12:01.199
Caption: our date and i&#39;m just going to like go

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:02.479
Caption: out on a wild limb here and say that

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.760
Caption: this returns the same thing as the

00:12:02.479 --> 00:12:07.359
Caption: previous one which it does

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.440
Caption: we can also pass in

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:12.719
Caption: a string that

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.638
Caption: looks like a date but isn&#39;t

00:12:12.719 --> 00:12:16.879
Caption: so an invalid

00:12:14.638 --> 00:12:19.199
Caption: pass in an invalid date string so that&#39;s

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.919
Caption: going to be something like

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.398
Caption: the

00:12:19.919 --> 00:12:23.599
Caption: 31st of february

00:12:22.398 --> 00:12:25.760
Caption: right so we don&#39;t know what that&#39;s going

00:12:23.599 --> 00:12:28.078
Caption: to return

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.559
Caption: oops

00:12:28.078 --> 00:12:31.679
Caption: um it turns out that it actually formats

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:33.278
Caption: the date for us and turns it into a

00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:35.278
Caption: valid date so again it returns a

00:12:33.278 --> 00:12:38.078
Caption: formatted date

00:12:35.278 --> 00:12:41.679
Caption: um apparently the 31st of february is

00:12:38.078 --> 00:12:41.679
Caption: just the 3rd of march

00:12:43.119 --> 00:12:47.760
Caption: makes sense i guess

00:12:45.919 --> 00:12:49.679
Caption: um the other thing that we can pass in

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.200
Caption: is a string that just isn&#39;t

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:54.559
Caption: a date at all so um it returns we don&#39;t

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.958
Caption: know

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:58.958
Caption: um and a thing that isn&#39;t a date

00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:02.000
Caption: would be like say a banana that&#39;s a

00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:04.479
Caption: completely different kind of fruit

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.638
Caption: and what&#39;s that going to return

00:13:04.479 --> 00:13:08.880
Caption: it is going to return the string invalid

00:13:06.638 --> 00:13:08.880
Caption: date

00:13:09.679 --> 00:13:13.599
Caption: so we can stick that in

00:13:13.838 --> 00:13:16.799
Caption: and we&#39;re going to expect it to be

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.320
Caption: invalid

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:20.958
Caption: excellent so that just leaves one more

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.359
Caption: scenario which is the case where we pass

00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.479
Caption: in a number so again there&#39;s sort of

00:13:23.359 --> 00:13:27.119
Caption: three

00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:29.919
Caption: number scenarios to consider

00:13:27.119 --> 00:13:31.599
Caption: so when we pass in a

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:33.278
Caption: number so when we pass a number to the

00:13:31.599 --> 00:13:34.880
Caption: date constructor what we&#39;re passing in

00:13:33.278 --> 00:13:36.719
Caption: is the number of milliseconds that have

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.638
Caption: passed since midnight on the first of

00:13:36.719 --> 00:13:41.199
Caption: january 1970

00:13:38.638 --> 00:13:43.359
Caption: because of course it is

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.000
Caption: um

00:13:43.359 --> 00:13:49.119
Caption: so we can get that value just by pulling

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Caption: get time on an on a valid date

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:55.200
Caption: oh no it didn&#39;t work

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.958
Caption: because you have to put

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.720
Caption: oh it has to be a new date you have to

00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.000
Caption: put all of the things in right you have

00:13:58.719 --> 00:14:01.919
Caption: to actually make it a date you can&#39;t

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.159
Caption: just call get time on a string doesn&#39;t

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:04.159
Caption: work

00:14:07.359 --> 00:14:10.159
Caption: all right have all the brackets lined up

00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:12.719
Caption: yes

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:14.398
Caption: okay so then the other two cases well

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:16.239
Caption: the first of the other two cases for a

00:14:14.398 --> 00:14:17.599
Caption: number is if we pass in a negative

00:14:16.239 --> 00:14:19.278
Caption: number

00:14:17.599 --> 00:14:21.119
Caption: uh so in this case a negative number is

00:14:19.278 --> 00:14:23.198
Caption: going to be one that was before the

00:14:21.119 --> 00:14:24.638
Caption: first of january 1970

00:14:23.198 --> 00:14:29.239
Caption: i don&#39;t know if anybody can imagine a

00:14:24.638 --> 00:14:29.239
Caption: date that long ago but

00:14:30.239 --> 00:14:34.638
Caption: so that&#39;s just going to format that&#39;s

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.958
Caption: the way that you would expect

00:14:34.638 --> 00:14:38.638
Caption: this um this kind of testing really gets

00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.398
Caption: you to exercise those copy and paste

00:14:38.638 --> 00:14:43.198
Caption: skills it&#39;s

00:14:40.398 --> 00:14:45.359
Caption: exactly what we&#39;ve been training for

00:14:43.198 --> 00:14:47.759
Caption: um cool and then the last case that i

00:14:45.359 --> 00:14:49.119
Caption: always used to like to test with numbers

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.078
Caption: is the number

00:14:49.119 --> 00:14:53.198
Caption: zero so when we pass in

00:14:52.078 --> 00:14:54.559
Caption: zero

00:14:53.198 --> 00:14:56.398
Caption: um

00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:58.799
Caption: it&#39;s going to return i don&#39;t know it

00:14:56.398 --> 00:15:02.159
Caption: could be anything

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:02.159
Caption: let&#39;s just pass in zero here

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.638
Caption: is the suspense really getting to

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:11.278
Caption: everyone yes

00:15:08.638 --> 00:15:13.119
Caption: okay so this has failed and what it&#39;s

00:15:11.278 --> 00:15:16.159
Caption: actually returned is an empty string

00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:17.919
Caption: right so this is a bug in our code

00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:19.440
Caption: and the reason that this bug is there is

00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:21.039
Caption: because we&#39;ve got this test right at the

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.119
Caption: start that says if the date is falsy

00:15:21.039 --> 00:15:25.679
Caption: return empty string and zero is of

00:15:23.119 --> 00:15:27.599
Caption: course a falsie value

00:15:25.679 --> 00:15:29.278
Caption: and we could go ahead and fix this but

00:15:27.599 --> 00:15:31.359
Caption: like i said we try not to do that when

00:15:29.278 --> 00:15:33.278
Caption: we&#39;re refactoring so instead we&#39;re just

00:15:31.359 --> 00:15:36.638
Caption: going to document the fact that it has

00:15:33.278 --> 00:15:36.638
Caption: this odd behavior

00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:41.198
Caption: in our test here and the reason that i

00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:43.198
Caption: wouldn&#39;t fix this even though it would

00:15:41.198 --> 00:15:44.559
Caption: be low risk um it&#39;s unlikely to break

00:15:43.198 --> 00:15:45.919
Caption: anything if i fix it but there could be

00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:47.119
Caption: people in our code base who are using

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:48.638
Caption: this function

00:15:47.119 --> 00:15:50.239
Caption: and who have written some work around

00:15:48.638 --> 00:15:51.838
Caption: code and their work around code isn&#39;t

00:15:50.239 --> 00:15:54.479
Caption: going to make any sense once we fix the

00:15:51.838 --> 00:15:56.078
Caption: bug so it would sort of just be you know

00:15:54.479 --> 00:15:58.719
Caption: saving a bit of tech that if before we

00:15:56.078 --> 00:16:00.638
Caption: fix this bug we go and check who else is

00:15:58.719 --> 00:16:01.838
Caption: using it so we&#39;ll write up a jira card

00:16:00.638 --> 00:16:04.559
Caption: stick it on the board someone else&#39;s

00:16:01.838 --> 00:16:04.559
Caption: problem for later

00:16:05.278 --> 00:16:09.518
Caption: all right so that&#39;s all of the tests

00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:11.119
Caption: that i would write for this um we could

00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:12.479
Caption: keep going right it&#39;s javascript so we

00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:14.479
Caption: could write a test for what happens if

00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:15.518
Caption: you&#39;re passing a boolean and the result

00:16:14.479 --> 00:16:16.799
Caption: of that would actually be kind of

00:16:15.518 --> 00:16:18.559
Caption: interesting because if we passed in

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:20.799
Caption: false or we get into empty string but if

00:16:18.559 --> 00:16:22.559
Caption: we passed in true we&#39;d get invalid date

00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:23.758
Caption: um but i&#39;m not going to do that for two

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:27.599
Caption: reasons first of all if this was

00:16:23.758 --> 00:16:27.599
Caption: production code i just use typescript

00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:30.320
Caption: the only reason i&#39;m not using typescript

00:16:29.119 --> 00:16:32.159
Caption: here is because it&#39;s real long and it

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.759
Caption: takes up too much space but yeah just

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:36.078
Caption: use typescript and the other reason is

00:16:33.758 --> 00:16:37.518
Caption: that if if you&#39;re in your code base

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:39.758
Caption: you&#39;ve got to the point where people are

00:16:37.518 --> 00:16:42.880
Caption: passing booleans into date formatting

00:16:39.758 --> 00:16:44.239
Caption: functions you&#39;ve got bigger problems

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.320
Caption: um maybe

00:16:44.239 --> 00:16:48.159
Caption: deal with those

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.838
Caption: okay so now finally we&#39;re ready to do

00:16:48.159 --> 00:16:51.599
Caption: our

00:16:48.838 --> 00:16:54.638
Caption: refactor um so like i said we&#39;re going

00:16:51.599 --> 00:16:57.518
Caption: to use the date fns i feel like it&#39;s

00:16:54.638 --> 00:16:58.958
Caption: pronounced date functions so

00:16:57.518 --> 00:17:00.078
Caption: date fins

00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:04.798
Caption: um

00:17:00.078 --> 00:17:06.640
Caption: format from date fins

00:17:04.798 --> 00:17:08.558
Caption: um we&#39;re going to replace moment with

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.719
Caption: that so date functions the format

00:17:08.558 --> 00:17:12.719
Caption: function is going to take a date um just

00:17:10.719 --> 00:17:14.719
Caption: like moment did and it&#39;s going to take a

00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:16.640
Caption: formatting string as a second argument

00:17:14.719 --> 00:17:18.400
Caption: but it&#39;s a slightly different library so

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.958
Caption: obviously it needs to use a slightly

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.400
Caption: different rendering formatting string

00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.160
Caption: because it wouldn&#39;t be javascript if we

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.359
Caption: didn&#39;t

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.359
Caption: and we can see that all of our tests

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:31.119
Caption: have passed except for one and the one

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:33.439
Caption: that&#39;s failed is the invalid string

00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:35.359
Caption: you can see that there it is actually

00:17:33.439 --> 00:17:37.199
Caption: throwing an error rather than returning

00:17:35.359 --> 00:17:40.079
Caption: a string this is i would argue that this

00:17:37.199 --> 00:17:41.439
Caption: is actually better behavior but

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:42.959
Caption: like i said we&#39;re not trying to change

00:17:41.439 --> 00:17:44.798
Caption: anything here we&#39;re just trying to keep

00:17:42.959 --> 00:17:47.839
Caption: it all the same so we can just wrap this

00:17:44.798 --> 00:17:47.839
Caption: in a try catch

00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:57.519
Caption: and instead return

00:17:58.798 --> 00:18:04.639
Caption: invalid date is it capital letter

00:18:02.558 --> 00:18:05.918
Caption: we&#39;ll find out

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.239
Caption: no

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:09.439
Caption: okay so that&#39;s our refactor done now you

00:18:08.239 --> 00:18:11.520
Caption: might ask

00:18:09.439 --> 00:18:13.439
Caption: was this really worth the effort right

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.679
Caption: this is like eight tests or something

00:18:13.439 --> 00:18:17.918
Caption: for four lines of code

00:18:15.678 --> 00:18:19.199
Caption: and the answer to that is

00:18:17.918 --> 00:18:21.918
Caption: um just like with everything else in

00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:24.000
Caption: software development it depends

00:18:21.918 --> 00:18:25.439
Caption: uh if this function was used by like one

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.959
Caption: component and we always knew what was

00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:28.558
Caption: going to go into it no of course i

00:18:26.959 --> 00:18:29.839
Caption: wouldn&#39;t write all these tests just

00:18:28.558 --> 00:18:32.000
Caption: maybe write one

00:18:29.839 --> 00:18:34.159
Caption: maybe cover it by the component test but

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.400
Caption: if this was like the formatting function

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.239
Caption: that&#39;s used across our entire code base

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.239
Caption: um so i made a change like this in a

00:18:38.239 --> 00:18:41.839
Caption: real live code base recently and the the

00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:43.439
Caption: function in question was used in over

00:18:41.839 --> 00:18:45.839
Caption: 300 places

00:18:43.439 --> 00:18:49.199
Caption: um so to me it&#39;s seven eight tests for

00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:50.479
Caption: 300 usages that seems like pretty fair

00:18:49.199 --> 00:18:52.079
Caption: um so yeah you&#39;re always going to have

00:18:50.479 --> 00:18:53.199
Caption: to make that that call for yourself and

00:18:52.079 --> 00:18:57.038
Caption: work out

00:18:53.199 --> 00:18:58.639
Caption: just how many tests you need

00:18:57.038 --> 00:19:01.038
Caption: okay so that&#39;s how characterization

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.678
Caption: tests work

00:19:01.038 --> 00:19:06.798
Caption: um but the next question here is how do

00:19:03.678 --> 00:19:08.159
Caption: we do this with jsx right jsx works a

00:19:06.798 --> 00:19:10.319
Caption: bit differently

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.320
Caption: how is that going to work so imagine we

00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:14.000
Caption: have this component here it&#39;s a user

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:15.519
Caption: info component it&#39;s going to take in

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.359
Caption: some user details

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.719
Caption: and it&#39;s going to print out the username

00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:22.558
Caption: was born on and then the date formatted

00:19:20.719 --> 00:19:24.798
Caption: using our format date function we just

00:19:22.558 --> 00:19:27.199
Caption: refracted and also the day of the week

00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:30.639
Caption: right so bob was born on the 1st of 1st

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:32.959
Caption: january 19th 8th 1990 um which was a

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.959
Caption: monday

00:19:34.239 --> 00:19:38.880
Caption: okay so how does that work so we have

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.640
Caption: our function here

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.760
Caption: we can describe

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.799
Caption: user

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.798
Caption: info component

00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:52.000
Caption: and we just say it

00:19:47.599 --> 00:19:54.640
Caption: does something we don&#39;t know what

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.319
Caption: um so we can render the components

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.320
Caption: oh you got to put all the brackets in

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:05.839
Caption: and the user is going to have a name

00:20:02.558 --> 00:20:08.239
Caption: and a birthday

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:11.038
Caption: which we can say is the 1st of january

00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:11.038
Caption: 1990.

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:16.558
Caption: um okay so how can we test this well the

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:21.799
Caption: first thing that we can do is we can

00:20:16.558 --> 00:20:21.798
Caption: grab a reference to the container

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:25.918
Caption: so the when we

00:20:24.319 --> 00:20:27.839
Caption: render a component with test library it

00:20:25.918 --> 00:20:31.678
Caption: gets rendered inside a div and this

00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:33.918
Caption: container just points div

00:20:31.678 --> 00:20:35.599
Caption: and then we can expect the text content

00:20:33.918 --> 00:20:39.519
Caption: of that container to be something so we

00:20:35.599 --> 00:20:41.760
Caption: can expect container

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.280
Caption: to have text content

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.798
Caption: and we don&#39;t know what it&#39;s going to be

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.239
Caption: so we can run our test

00:20:44.798 --> 00:20:47.439
Caption: and just like with our standard

00:20:46.239 --> 00:20:49.119
Caption: javascript

00:20:47.439 --> 00:20:51.839
Caption: and the test will fail but it tells us

00:20:49.119 --> 00:20:51.839
Caption: what to expect

00:20:52.798 --> 00:20:58.719
Caption: so we can pop that in there

00:20:55.599 --> 00:21:01.280
Caption: and we can say that it renders the user

00:20:58.719 --> 00:21:01.280
Caption: details

00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:06.079
Caption: okay so that works great um

00:21:03.918 --> 00:21:07.599
Caption: so it works well in cases where you can

00:21:06.079 --> 00:21:08.880
Caption: just expect the text content to be a

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:10.640
Caption: specific thing

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.558
Caption: um if you&#39;ve got large complicated

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.839
Caption: components it can get a bit messy or if

00:21:12.558 --> 00:21:16.880
Caption: you&#39;re expecting different kinds of

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:18.959
Caption: behavior this perhaps isn&#39;t going to be

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.719
Caption: an easy way to do things

00:21:18.959 --> 00:21:22.798
Caption: um so the good news is we do have

00:21:20.719 --> 00:21:25.678
Caption: another tool available to us

00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:27.519
Caption: and that tool is snapshot tests

00:21:25.678 --> 00:21:29.199
Caption: so snapshot tests if you&#39;re not familiar

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.719
Caption: with them and i&#39;m guessing you are

00:21:29.199 --> 00:21:33.918
Caption: because you seemed very happy about them

00:21:32.719 --> 00:21:35.280
Caption: uh if you&#39;re not familiar with snapshot

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:37.359
Caption: tests the way that they work is that

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.039
Caption: when you first run your test uh it

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:40.798
Caption: generates a snapshot and a snapshot is

00:21:39.038 --> 00:21:41.918
Caption: just a text representation of your

00:21:40.798 --> 00:21:43.199
Caption: component

00:21:41.918 --> 00:21:45.359
Caption: and then you go ahead and you make your

00:21:43.199 --> 00:21:47.038
Caption: changes do whatever you need to do and

00:21:45.359 --> 00:21:48.479
Caption: then when you run the test again it&#39;s

00:21:47.038 --> 00:21:50.319
Caption: going to generate another snapshot and

00:21:48.479 --> 00:21:51.439
Caption: it&#39;s going to compare the original one

00:21:50.319 --> 00:21:52.719
Caption: with the new one and it&#39;s going to tell

00:21:51.439 --> 00:21:54.319
Caption: you if they match or if they&#39;re

00:21:52.719 --> 00:21:56.640
Caption: different

00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:59.839
Caption: so let&#39;s try that

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.839
Caption: so here we can grab

00:22:00.079 --> 00:22:03.038
Caption: the same test again

00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:06.400
Caption: um and the test that we&#39;re doing now is

00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:07.678
Caption: we&#39;re just going to say that it matches

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.960
Caption: the snapshot

00:22:07.678 --> 00:22:12.558
Caption: that matches the snapshot

00:22:10.959 --> 00:22:14.798
Caption: and then instead of testing whether it

00:22:12.558 --> 00:22:17.038
Caption: has text content we can just say we can

00:22:14.798 --> 00:22:18.798
Caption: expect it to match

00:22:17.038 --> 00:22:20.558
Caption: snapshot

00:22:18.798 --> 00:22:22.000
Caption: cool and now when we run this you see

00:22:20.558 --> 00:22:24.079
Caption: the test passes you can see down the

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.839
Caption: bottom here one snapshot written

00:22:24.079 --> 00:22:27.519
Caption: and we can see we&#39;ve got this new folder

00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:30.000
Caption: here called underscore underscore

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:32.159
Caption: snapshots underscore underscore

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.678
Caption: um and a

00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:35.440
Caption: file that has the same name as our test

00:22:33.678 --> 00:22:36.959
Caption: file with dot snap on the end

00:22:35.439 --> 00:22:38.879
Caption: and in here you can see this is the text

00:22:36.959 --> 00:22:40.640
Caption: representation of our component that&#39;s

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.440
Caption: been generated

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.200
Caption: if we jump back into our test and change

00:22:43.439 --> 00:22:47.599
Caption: something so we say actually it turns

00:22:45.199 --> 00:22:50.239
Caption: out bob was born on the second january

00:22:47.599 --> 00:22:52.959
Caption: we rerun the test this time it fails it

00:22:50.239 --> 00:22:54.558
Caption: says that the snapshot failed

00:22:52.959 --> 00:22:56.640
Caption: um and it shows us what the difference

00:22:54.558 --> 00:22:57.760
Caption: is right it was rendering the first now

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.200
Caption: it&#39;s rendering the second it was

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.839
Caption: rendering monday now it&#39;s rendering

00:22:59.199 --> 00:23:03.678
Caption: tuesday now we know that that&#39;s actually

00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:05.760
Caption: correct because we just changed value so

00:23:03.678 --> 00:23:07.359
Caption: we can just hit u and update the

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.359
Caption: snapshot and now if we look at our

00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:11.038
Caption: snapshot you can see it says tuesday

00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:14.079
Caption: everything&#39;s happy our test is great we

00:23:11.038 --> 00:23:14.079
Caption: know we haven&#39;t broken anything

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:18.240
Caption: all right cool so snapshot tests are

00:23:16.558 --> 00:23:20.719
Caption: very handy for this kind of thing but

00:23:18.239 --> 00:23:22.640
Caption: they do have some limitations

00:23:20.719 --> 00:23:24.000
Caption: so the first is that you lose a lot of

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.079
Caption: clarity when you&#39;re using a snapshot

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.678
Caption: test so imagine that we have this

00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:29.279
Caption: component called the increment that

00:23:27.678 --> 00:23:31.038
Caption: we&#39;re testing we&#39;ve got a snapshot test

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.479
Caption: on the left

00:23:31.038 --> 00:23:34.239
Caption: um and all we do is we render the

00:23:32.479 --> 00:23:36.479
Caption: component and then we

00:23:34.239 --> 00:23:38.319
Caption: expect it to match the snapshot then we

00:23:36.479 --> 00:23:39.678
Caption: click a button and we expect it to match

00:23:38.319 --> 00:23:41.678
Caption: the snapshot but there&#39;s not really

00:23:39.678 --> 00:23:43.119
Caption: information there about what&#39;s going on

00:23:41.678 --> 00:23:45.839
Caption: whereas if we wrote a more traditional

00:23:43.119 --> 00:23:47.760
Caption: kind of test what we get is we render

00:23:45.839 --> 00:23:49.199
Caption: the components and then we expect it to

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.880
Caption: have the number four which just so

00:23:49.199 --> 00:23:52.399
Caption: happens to be that same as that initial

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.918
Caption: number that we passed in so that&#39;s

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.679
Caption: probably a good hint that it&#39;s rendering

00:23:53.918 --> 00:23:57.519
Caption: out the number we passed in

00:23:55.678 --> 00:23:59.279
Caption: then we click the button and we expect

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.119
Caption: it to have five which is a good hint

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:04.400
Caption: that probably this component called

00:24:01.119 --> 00:24:06.880
Caption: increment incremented the number that

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.320
Caption: um so there&#39;s just a lot more sort of

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.159
Caption: detail for the next person who&#39;s looking

00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:11.599
Caption: at this component in a more traditional

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:14.480
Caption: test

00:24:11.599 --> 00:24:17.199
Caption: which can you know have pros and cons

00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:18.719
Caption: um also snapshots don&#39;t render all of

00:24:17.199 --> 00:24:20.719
Caption: the information about the component that

00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:21.520
Caption: you might expect them to

00:24:20.719 --> 00:24:22.959
Caption: so

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.479
Caption: imagine this component this is called

00:24:22.959 --> 00:24:27.199
Caption: clicky magic

00:24:24.479 --> 00:24:29.038
Caption: clicking magic renders a text box onto

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:30.798
Caption: the screen when you click the text block

00:24:29.038 --> 00:24:32.479
Caption: the checkbox it waits two seconds and

00:24:30.798 --> 00:24:34.639
Caption: then it unchecks the checkbox

00:24:32.479 --> 00:24:36.640
Caption: i can&#39;t imagine any situation where this

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.520
Caption: would be useful

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.919
Caption: but

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.320
Caption: i wrote a test for it anyway

00:24:39.918 --> 00:24:44.000
Caption: so this test is using snapshots it&#39;s

00:24:42.319 --> 00:24:45.599
Caption: going to use fake timers because we need

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.359
Caption: to handle that two second delay it&#39;s

00:24:45.599 --> 00:24:49.119
Caption: going to render our components we&#39;re

00:24:47.359 --> 00:24:50.400
Caption: going to check the checkbox

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:52.158
Caption: we&#39;re going to check that it matches the

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.520
Caption: snapshot then we&#39;re going to wait two

00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:55.200
Caption: seconds and then we&#39;re going to check

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.039
Caption: that it matches the snapshot again and

00:24:55.199 --> 00:24:58.719
Caption: this test will pass

00:24:57.038 --> 00:25:00.399
Caption: and this test will pass even if we take

00:24:58.719 --> 00:25:02.000
Caption: out the weight for two seconds

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.440
Caption: this test will pass even if we break the

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.599
Caption: component so that it does do anything

00:25:03.439 --> 00:25:07.278
Caption: other than render a checkbox

00:25:05.599 --> 00:25:09.439
Caption: and the reason for that is that the

00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:10.799
Caption: snapshot that gets rendered looks like

00:25:09.439 --> 00:25:13.199
Caption: this

00:25:10.798 --> 00:25:15.278
Caption: right it just says that there&#39;s an input

00:25:13.199 --> 00:25:16.959
Caption: with a checkbox we&#39;ve got no information

00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:18.799
Caption: about the state of the checkbox in there

00:25:16.959 --> 00:25:20.079
Caption: so it&#39;s just something to be careful of

00:25:18.798 --> 00:25:21.599
Caption: i&#39;ve run into similar issues with

00:25:20.079 --> 00:25:23.199
Caption: snapshot tests where people had written

00:25:21.599 --> 00:25:24.719
Caption: the snapshot

00:25:23.199 --> 00:25:27.199
Caption: but the component loaded everything

00:25:24.719 --> 00:25:29.359
Caption: asynchronously so there were all these

00:25:27.199 --> 00:25:31.119
Caption: tests but all they were was like this

00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:33.439
Caption: empty component and

00:25:31.119 --> 00:25:34.880
Caption: they weren&#39;t really testing anything so

00:25:33.439 --> 00:25:36.239
Caption: just make sure that your snapshots do

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.918
Caption: contain the information that you need

00:25:36.239 --> 00:25:40.158
Caption: them to

00:25:37.918 --> 00:25:42.959
Caption: uh and the third limitation of snapshot

00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:45.200
Caption: tests is that you can&#39;t do tdd with them

00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:46.719
Caption: you might say i don&#39;t care i hate tdd

00:25:45.199 --> 00:25:48.798
Caption: and that&#39;s fair enough

00:25:46.719 --> 00:25:51.119
Caption: um or why do we care about tdd we&#39;re

00:25:48.798 --> 00:25:53.119
Caption: refactoring at the moment and yes that&#39;s

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:55.678
Caption: true but we&#39;re refactoring remember

00:25:53.119 --> 00:25:57.119
Caption: because we&#39;re intending to make change

00:25:55.678 --> 00:25:58.640
Caption: and when we go to make that change the

00:25:57.119 --> 00:26:00.239
Caption: snapshot tests aren&#39;t going to provide

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.279
Caption: us a good basis for those new feature

00:26:00.239 --> 00:26:03.520
Caption: tests that we&#39;re going to write because

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:05.279
Caption: they do like that clarity that&#39;s not to

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.640
Caption: say that they don&#39;t have a place

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:08.320
Caption: but it&#39;s probably worth considering

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.400
Caption: whether you need other kinds of tests as

00:26:08.319 --> 00:26:12.558
Caption: well

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.320
Caption: okay snapshot tests are really excellent

00:26:12.558 --> 00:26:16.399
Caption: in two situations though

00:26:14.319 --> 00:26:18.158
Caption: and the first is when you have those big

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.839
Caption: thousand line components and you don&#39;t

00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:22.159
Caption: want to test every single thing that&#39;s

00:26:19.839 --> 00:26:23.599
Caption: going on in there snapshot tests are

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:25.440
Caption: excellent for that

00:26:23.599 --> 00:26:26.479
Caption: um and the other place i quite like them

00:26:25.439 --> 00:26:28.000
Caption: is things that have got a lot of

00:26:26.479 --> 00:26:29.599
Caption: presentation logic i don&#39;t know if

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.558
Caption: you&#39;ve ever tried to write tests for a

00:26:29.599 --> 00:26:33.199
Caption: table

00:26:30.558 --> 00:26:36.079
Caption: but they&#39;re a mess they&#39;re brittle um

00:26:33.199 --> 00:26:37.439
Caption: and they don&#39;t really have that good

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:39.119
Caption: information in them right so this is a

00:26:37.439 --> 00:26:42.000
Caption: good use to just use a snapshot test

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:42.000
Caption: instead it&#39;s simpler

00:26:42.239 --> 00:26:47.520
Caption: okay so that brings us to the example

00:26:45.678 --> 00:26:50.079
Caption: part of the whole thing so we&#39;re going

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:52.558
Caption: to look at an app called the old farm

00:26:50.079 --> 00:26:54.079
Caption: shop the older farmer shopper

00:26:52.558 --> 00:26:56.880
Caption: the important thing to remember here is

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:59.519
Caption: that letter at the start isn&#39;t a y

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.959
Caption: it&#39;s a thorn and it&#39;s pronounced

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.279
Caption: so in english we used to have this

00:27:00.959 --> 00:27:04.479
Caption: letter thorn then the dutch or whoever

00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:05.520
Caption: it was came along with their printing

00:27:04.479 --> 00:27:06.959
Caption: press and they were like we don&#39;t have

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.640
Caption: that letter you don&#39;t get to have it

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:10.399
Caption: anymore get rid of it

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.079
Caption: um and it sort of looks like a lot of

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.000
Caption: why so people started using the letter y

00:27:12.079 --> 00:27:16.640
Caption: and then we ended up with this situation

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.199
Caption: but it is legitimately pronounced the

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.279
Caption: older farmer

00:27:19.199 --> 00:27:22.639
Caption: it&#39;s important okay what does that look

00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:24.320
Caption: like

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.119
Caption: this is our app we&#39;re selling farm

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:28.399
Caption: produce so you can buy plants

00:27:27.119 --> 00:27:30.798
Caption: you can buy

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.960
Caption: seed packets or seedlings

00:27:30.798 --> 00:27:34.719
Caption: and you can pick different numbers don&#39;t

00:27:32.959 --> 00:27:35.520
Caption: buy zero that would be weird

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:36.959
Caption: um

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.719
Caption: and you&#39;re going to get

00:27:36.959 --> 00:27:40.079
Caption: sort of the unit price in this little

00:27:38.719 --> 00:27:43.918
Caption: label here

00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:45.678
Caption: um a subtotal a postage cost and a total

00:27:43.918 --> 00:27:48.239
Caption: and we&#39;re all good with that it&#39;s not

00:27:45.678 --> 00:27:50.079
Caption: too complicated cool

00:27:48.239 --> 00:27:52.798
Caption: we&#39;ve got some new requirements so we

00:27:50.079 --> 00:27:54.880
Caption: want to add a third product type so we

00:27:52.798 --> 00:27:56.079
Caption: want to add a new radio button that says

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.440
Caption: plants

00:27:56.079 --> 00:27:58.798
Caption: and we&#39;re going to show the unit price

00:27:57.439 --> 00:27:59.918
Caption: and the total price for a plant and

00:27:58.798 --> 00:28:00.839
Caption: we&#39;re going to calculate the postage for

00:27:59.918 --> 00:28:03.199
Caption: a

00:28:00.839 --> 00:28:04.158
Caption: plant um so it&#39;ll start looking like

00:28:03.199 --> 00:28:07.199
Caption: this

00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:08.480
Caption: now we could in theory implement these

00:28:07.199 --> 00:28:10.239
Caption: requirements in the order that they were

00:28:08.479 --> 00:28:11.918
Caption: given but we&#39;re not going to do that and

00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:14.239
Caption: the reason for that is that if we

00:28:11.918 --> 00:28:15.678
Caption: implement that radio button first

00:28:14.239 --> 00:28:18.079
Caption: then we&#39;ve got to do the whole thing in

00:28:15.678 --> 00:28:19.119
Caption: one go right we can&#39;t we can&#39;t stop

00:28:18.079 --> 00:28:21.278
Caption: halfway

00:28:19.119 --> 00:28:22.479
Caption: whereas if we start with the label we

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:24.000
Caption: can just implement the change we need

00:28:22.479 --> 00:28:25.520
Caption: for the label we could merge that in it

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.599
Caption: can go to production without the rest of

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.599
Caption: it and it&#39;ll be fine

00:28:27.599 --> 00:28:31.839
Caption: um so it&#39;s sort of like a cheating

00:28:29.599 --> 00:28:34.079
Caption: feature flag i guess

00:28:31.839 --> 00:28:35.439
Caption: um you could argue that this is a very

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:36.880
Caption: small change and you could just do it

00:28:35.439 --> 00:28:38.479
Caption: all in one go and you&#39;re absolutely

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.399
Caption: right but like we&#39;ve got time limits on

00:28:38.479 --> 00:28:41.678
Caption: this talk and i&#39;m not confident that i&#39;m

00:28:40.399 --> 00:28:45.840
Caption: going to get through the whole thing so

00:28:41.678 --> 00:28:45.839
Caption: we&#39;re just going to start with the label

00:28:46.319 --> 00:28:49.519
Caption: all right

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.000
Caption: now

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.760
Caption: here is the component

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.520
Caption: that

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.719
Caption: renders this page

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.799
Caption: it&#39;s not

00:28:56.719 --> 00:29:00.479
Caption: an amazing bit of work

00:28:58.798 --> 00:29:02.239
Caption: but it&#39;s what we&#39;re working with

00:29:00.479 --> 00:29:04.319
Caption: so the bit that we care about is this

00:29:02.239 --> 00:29:06.000
Caption: label here except actually it&#39;s these

00:29:04.319 --> 00:29:07.839
Caption: two labels here because we&#39;ve just

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.199
Caption: repeated all this code

00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:10.880
Caption: for both this is actually some

00:29:09.199 --> 00:29:13.839
Caption: production code that&#39;s had its identity

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:16.239
Caption: changed to protect the innocent but this

00:29:13.839 --> 00:29:18.798
Caption: this was real code in production

00:29:16.239 --> 00:29:20.479
Caption: um so we don&#39;t want to write another

00:29:18.798 --> 00:29:21.918
Caption: block like this right

00:29:20.479 --> 00:29:23.359
Caption: um because we don&#39;t want to have more

00:29:21.918 --> 00:29:25.759
Caption: repetitive code in there but also

00:29:23.359 --> 00:29:28.000
Caption: because we can&#39;t write a test for

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.359
Caption: changing the label with the code all

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.119
Caption: glommed into one component like this

00:29:29.359 --> 00:29:32.959
Caption: right we need to separate it out

00:29:31.119 --> 00:29:34.640
Caption: so we&#39;re going to start by creating a

00:29:32.959 --> 00:29:35.918
Caption: new label component that is separate to

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.760
Caption: everything else

00:29:35.918 --> 00:29:39.278
Caption: before we do that though we&#39;re going to

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.359
Caption: write some component tests uh some

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:42.080
Caption: characterization tests

00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:44.158
Caption: so

00:29:42.079 --> 00:29:45.038
Caption: this is going to be the product

00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:48.320
Caption: test

00:29:45.038 --> 00:29:49.759
Caption: dot jsx do not accidentally write tsx

00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:52.479
Caption: because yes code will be like oh it&#39;s a

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:56.558
Caption: type project like actually it&#39;s not

00:29:52.479 --> 00:29:56.558
Caption: um and it&#39;ll lead to sadness

00:29:57.119 --> 00:30:00.479
Caption: okay so we&#39;re gonna test our product

00:29:58.558 --> 00:30:02.079
Caption: component now we&#39;ve got four scenarios

00:30:00.479 --> 00:30:04.158
Caption: that we need to test not seven or eight

00:30:02.079 --> 00:30:06.079
Caption: like the last one this is four so that&#39;s

00:30:04.159 --> 00:30:07.840
Caption: going to be when we&#39;ve got seed packets

00:30:06.079 --> 00:30:09.119
Caption: selected and we&#39;ve got no amount entered

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:10.880
Caption: when we&#39;ve got seed packets and an

00:30:09.119 --> 00:30:12.880
Caption: amount when we&#39;ve got seedlings and no

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.239
Caption: amount and seedlings and an amount it&#39;s

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.079
Caption: going to be a lot of copy and pasting i

00:30:14.239 --> 00:30:17.278
Caption: promise

00:30:16.079 --> 00:30:19.038
Caption: so when

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:23.440
Caption: seed

00:30:19.038 --> 00:30:26.158
Caption: packets is selected and no amount

00:30:23.439 --> 00:30:26.158
Caption: is entered

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.399
Caption: it&#39;s now this we&#39;ve got a great big

00:30:28.798 --> 00:30:31.760
Caption: component we only compare about care

00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:34.239
Caption: about a small part of it this is an

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:37.839
Caption: excellent use for snapshot tests so it

00:30:34.239 --> 00:30:37.839
Caption: matches the snapshot

00:30:39.359 --> 00:30:44.640
Caption: all right so we need to grab a reference

00:30:41.678 --> 00:30:44.640
Caption: to our container

00:30:45.038 --> 00:30:48.398
Caption: screen.get

00:30:46.798 --> 00:30:51.519
Caption: no not screen we want to render the

00:30:48.399 --> 00:30:53.840
Caption: component first

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:56.799
Caption: um product

00:30:53.839 --> 00:30:59.599
Caption: product which takes a

00:30:56.798 --> 00:31:02.079
Caption: proper product we&#39;re going to do because

00:30:59.599 --> 00:31:02.079
Caption: why not

00:31:02.239 --> 00:31:07.439
Caption: um we need to import that

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.239
Caption: yep import it

00:31:07.439 --> 00:31:10.239
Caption: yeah all right

00:31:10.319 --> 00:31:12.558
Caption: okay

00:31:16.079 --> 00:31:22.880
Caption: no not that one okay we got there no

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.479
Caption: thanks to uvs code

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.319
Caption: uh we want to grab a reference to that

00:31:24.479 --> 00:31:30.479
Caption: radio button so that&#39;s gonna be seed

00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:32.798
Caption: packets equals screened okay by roll

00:31:30.479 --> 00:31:34.319
Caption: and the roll of a radio button is radio

00:31:32.798 --> 00:31:35.918
Caption: nice and easy but there&#39;s a couple of

00:31:34.319 --> 00:31:39.518
Caption: radio buttons on the screen so let&#39;s

00:31:35.918 --> 00:31:39.518
Caption: pass it in a name as well

00:31:40.719 --> 00:31:44.880
Caption: um and then you want to

00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:47.679
Caption: click

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.558
Caption: that radio button

00:31:47.678 --> 00:31:52.880
Caption: all right um we need to import screen as

00:31:50.558 --> 00:31:52.880
Caption: well

00:31:53.199 --> 00:31:57.518
Caption: and that&#39;s it then we can expect our

00:31:55.519 --> 00:32:01.640
Caption: container

00:31:57.519 --> 00:32:01.640
Caption: to match the snapshot

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Caption: and we do that we get a snapshot

00:32:03.439 --> 00:32:07.359
Caption: generated and everything is great

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.279
Caption: okay so then we&#39;ve got our second

00:32:07.359 --> 00:32:12.079
Caption: scenario

00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:15.440
Caption: which looks a lot like the first one

00:32:12.079 --> 00:32:17.439
Caption: um except an amount is entered

00:32:15.439 --> 00:32:18.239
Caption: so we&#39;re going to grab a reference to

00:32:17.439 --> 00:32:19.759
Caption: the

00:32:18.239 --> 00:32:21.839
Caption: well i think it&#39;s called number or count

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.079
Caption: or something like i remember

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:26.640
Caption: um i&#39;m going to do screen.get by roll

00:32:24.079 --> 00:32:29.599
Caption: now this time the it&#39;s an input of type

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.839
Caption: number so as everybody knows the aria

00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:34.798
Caption: rule for that is

00:32:31.839 --> 00:32:34.798
Caption: yes spin button

00:32:36.719 --> 00:32:40.640
Caption: there&#39;s only one on the screen so we

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.640
Caption: won&#39;t worry about a name

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:46.319
Caption: and we&#39;re going to pass in four say

00:32:44.319 --> 00:32:47.359
Caption: all right now the snapshot written

00:32:46.319 --> 00:32:48.880
Caption: excellent

00:32:47.359 --> 00:32:52.719
Caption: then we just need to do the same thing

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.719
Caption: all over again but with the seedlings

00:32:53.359 --> 00:32:57.760
Caption: so if we

00:32:54.839 --> 00:33:00.398
Caption: when see links is selected and no

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.640
Caption: amounts then grab

00:33:00.399 --> 00:33:04.880
Caption: seedlings i guess we should rename this

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.880
Caption: too

00:33:07.839 --> 00:33:13.119
Caption: and when seedlings seed

00:33:10.479 --> 00:33:15.439
Caption: lings is selected and an amounts this is

00:33:13.119 --> 00:33:18.079
Caption: going to be seedlings

00:33:15.439 --> 00:33:18.079
Caption: seed kings

00:33:19.359 --> 00:33:23.519
Caption: and seedlings

00:33:22.239 --> 00:33:27.359
Caption: all right we&#39;re going to run the

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:27.359
Caption: snapshots oh something failed

00:33:29.599 --> 00:33:32.239
Caption: the name

00:33:33.038 --> 00:33:36.398
Caption: the next one

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:38.398
Caption: this one

00:33:36.399 --> 00:33:40.480
Caption: ah well spotted especially when it

00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:42.000
Caption: wasn&#39;t on the screen

00:33:40.479 --> 00:33:44.158
Caption: all right so we got all of our snapshots

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.760
Caption: written everything looks great except

00:33:44.159 --> 00:33:46.880
Caption: actually we have this warning that&#39;s

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.479
Caption: being thrown

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.839
Caption: and if you&#39;ve spent much time writing

00:33:48.479 --> 00:33:51.199
Caption: test react you&#39;ve probably seen this

00:33:49.839 --> 00:33:53.599
Caption: morning before

00:33:51.199 --> 00:33:55.599
Caption: this morning is a lie

00:33:53.599 --> 00:33:57.918
Caption: it has nothing to do with anything being

00:33:55.599 --> 00:34:00.079
Caption: wrapped in an act and it&#39;s very

00:33:57.918 --> 00:34:02.000
Caption: misleading but important

00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:04.398
Caption: so what&#39;s good what what causes this

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.959
Caption: warning is when the component state is

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:10.239
Caption: or the component state is updated after

00:34:06.959 --> 00:34:12.239
Caption: the test has finished so in our case

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:15.358
Caption: we change the number

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:17.839
Caption: of things which changes

00:34:15.358 --> 00:34:19.439
Caption: which cause this state which calls this

00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:21.280
Caption: use effect which causes calculate

00:34:19.439 --> 00:34:22.638
Caption: postage function

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.678
Caption: and when it&#39;s

00:34:22.638 --> 00:34:26.719
Caption: seed

00:34:23.678 --> 00:34:28.638
Caption: links and it&#39;s not zero it gets down to

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:30.560
Caption: this postage calculation which causes

00:34:28.638 --> 00:34:32.239
Caption: asynchronous function so we call this

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.320
Caption: asynchronous function it goes off and

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:36.158
Caption: does its asynchronous thing then our

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.479
Caption: test finishes

00:34:36.158 --> 00:34:40.398
Caption: then the asynchronous function returns

00:34:38.479 --> 00:34:42.000
Caption: then the state is updated and then react

00:34:40.398 --> 00:34:43.760
Caption: is like oh my god i&#39;m going to tell you

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.439
Caption: lies about act

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.520
Caption: um so that&#39;s what&#39;s causing the warning

00:34:45.439 --> 00:34:49.199
Caption: like it&#39;s a little a legitimate warning

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.040
Caption: it&#39;s just that it&#39;s not very helpfully

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:53.439
Caption: worded

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:56.239
Caption: um so the way that we can deal with that

00:34:53.439 --> 00:34:57.439
Caption: is we can just kind of wait for

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:59.280
Caption: um

00:34:57.439 --> 00:35:00.879
Caption: it not to be zero

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.280
Caption: so we look at the snapshot for instance

00:35:00.879 --> 00:35:05.519
Caption: we can see

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.520
Caption: uh

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.199
Caption: let&#39;s see

00:35:07.919 --> 00:35:12.319
Caption: postage

00:35:09.199 --> 00:35:12.320
Caption: total note the next one

00:35:12.639 --> 00:35:16.959
Caption: we can see that the seed no that seed

00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:19.838
Caption: packets oh my god when ceilings are

00:35:16.959 --> 00:35:21.598
Caption: selected and an amount that&#39;s the one

00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:23.280
Caption: okay we can see the number is eight but

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:26.000
Caption: the postage is zero

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.000
Caption: so we can say

00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:31.439
Caption: uh the postage equals

00:35:28.959 --> 00:35:32.959
Caption: screen dot get by

00:35:31.439 --> 00:35:35.040
Caption: text

00:35:32.959 --> 00:35:38.639
Caption: um let&#39;s just do a quick regex because

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:42.239
Caption: nothing ever goes wrong when you do that

00:35:38.639 --> 00:35:45.039
Caption: and then we can uh await

00:35:42.239 --> 00:35:46.560
Caption: i wait for

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.560
Caption: um

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.199
Caption: and then expect

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.199
Caption: postage

00:35:53.439 --> 00:35:58.399
Caption: but to have text content and i

00:35:57.199 --> 00:36:01.118
Caption: whatever it&#39;s going to be we can just

00:35:58.399 --> 00:36:01.118
Caption: run the test and see

00:36:03.199 --> 00:36:08.800
Caption: oh you have to make it an async function

00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:08.799
Caption: all the time

00:36:10.239 --> 00:36:14.479
Caption: okay so we can see the postage is

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.479
Caption: actually 32

00:36:14.479 --> 00:36:17.679
Caption: so we can change that

00:36:16.479 --> 00:36:19.679
Caption: and this is a slightly hacky way of

00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:21.838
Caption: doing this but you get get the idea so

00:36:19.679 --> 00:36:24.719
Caption: now snapshots failed because instead of

00:36:21.839 --> 00:36:26.560
Caption: zero dollars it&#39;s 32 instead of 32 the

00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:29.439
Caption: total is now 64. that&#39;s what we were

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:31.199
Caption: expecting so let&#39;s update the snapshot

00:36:29.439 --> 00:36:33.919
Caption: okay so now we&#39;ve got our

00:36:31.199 --> 00:36:35.679
Caption: characterization tests we can do our

00:36:33.919 --> 00:36:36.719
Caption: refactor

00:36:35.679 --> 00:36:39.358
Caption: now i&#39;m just going to write the new

00:36:36.719 --> 00:36:40.959
Caption: component sort of inside here because

00:36:39.358 --> 00:36:43.279
Caption: it&#39;s going to make it easier to copy and

00:36:40.959 --> 00:36:43.280
Caption: paste

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.839
Caption: um but in the real world you&#39;d probably

00:36:46.239 --> 00:36:50.159
Caption: put it in its own file and it could have

00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:51.680
Caption: its own like independent life and be

00:36:50.159 --> 00:36:52.879
Caption: happy

00:36:51.679 --> 00:36:55.040
Caption: so we&#39;re just going to return the same

00:36:52.879 --> 00:36:56.399
Caption: value we have here now in this case you

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.160
Caption: can see we&#39;ve got two bits of text that

00:36:56.399 --> 00:37:00.399
Caption: are essentially the same thing so rather

00:36:58.159 --> 00:37:02.959
Caption: than having it all repeated

00:37:00.399 --> 00:37:04.879
Caption: let&#39;s kind of parameterize it

00:37:02.959 --> 00:37:06.719
Caption: so we can pull out those names and we

00:37:04.879 --> 00:37:08.479
Caption: can say seed packets

00:37:06.719 --> 00:37:11.118
Caption: is going to be

00:37:08.479 --> 00:37:14.000
Caption: seed packets

00:37:11.118 --> 00:37:17.039
Caption: and seedlings

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.280
Caption: is going to be seedlings

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:23.359
Caption: and we can get rid of all of

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:25.520
Caption: that and we can just say number of

00:37:23.358 --> 00:37:28.159
Caption: uh names

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.159
Caption: product type

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.119
Caption: oh don&#39;t put a dollar sign there you&#39;re

00:37:32.479 --> 00:37:35.118
Caption: out of control

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.599
Caption: um and again here instead of this being

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.839
Caption: seed packets it can just be

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:43.680
Caption: product type

00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:46.000
Caption: um oh then we need to pass in product

00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:46.000
Caption: type

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:51.439
Caption: and we need to pass in count

00:37:49.118 --> 00:37:54.719
Caption: because we&#39;re using that here

00:37:51.439 --> 00:37:57.358
Caption: and we just change this one more

00:37:54.719 --> 00:37:57.358
Caption: product type

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.560
Caption: and then we get rid of all of that we

00:38:00.399 --> 00:38:04.239
Caption: put one more closing bracket we wish

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.359
Caption: we&#39;d set up prettier so that it

00:38:04.239 --> 00:38:10.719
Caption: reformatted everything

00:38:07.358 --> 00:38:14.399
Caption: um oh and it does doesn&#39;t do anything

00:38:10.719 --> 00:38:14.399
Caption: okay so now we can replace all of this

00:38:14.479 --> 00:38:20.079
Caption: with our new label component

00:38:16.639 --> 00:38:20.078
Caption: which takes a product type

00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:24.479
Caption: and account

00:38:26.959 --> 00:38:31.439
Caption: and we run our snapshot tests again they

00:38:29.358 --> 00:38:33.838
Caption: all fail but the only reason they fail

00:38:31.439 --> 00:38:35.520
Caption: is that the the white space has changed

00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:36.800
Caption: because we&#39;ve added in all of those

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.520
Caption: interpolations

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.800
Caption: so we can just update that and it&#39;s fine

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.159
Caption: cool so this is looking pretty good

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.400
Caption: except there is one more little

00:38:42.159 --> 00:38:47.598
Caption: dependency in here that&#39;s not super

00:38:44.399 --> 00:38:48.959
Caption: obvious but this id on this input uh

00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:51.359
Caption: needs to match

00:38:48.959 --> 00:38:52.959
Caption: the html4 on this label

00:38:51.358 --> 00:38:54.399
Caption: um and we like we need those two things

00:38:52.959 --> 00:38:56.479
Caption: to be the same there&#39;s a couple of ways

00:38:54.399 --> 00:38:57.520
Caption: we could deal with that we could just

00:38:56.479 --> 00:38:59.598
Caption: hope

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.239
Caption: that no one changes it

00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:04.400
Caption: uh we could pass the id into the label

00:39:02.239 --> 00:39:06.159
Caption: um which could work but what i would

00:39:04.399 --> 00:39:08.239
Caption: suggest that we do is we kind of accept

00:39:06.159 --> 00:39:10.559
Caption: that these two this label and this input

00:39:08.239 --> 00:39:11.760
Caption: are very tightly coupled and probably

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.959
Caption: the best thing to do is just to put them

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.800
Caption: all into the component together

00:39:14.959 --> 00:39:18.320
Caption: so now instead of this being a label

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.320
Caption: component it&#39;s going to be a number

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.760
Caption: input component

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.760
Caption: and we&#39;re going to wrap it in div

00:39:25.439 --> 00:39:30.239
Caption: get rid of that bracket

00:39:27.439 --> 00:39:32.399
Caption: and paste all of that in

00:39:30.239 --> 00:39:36.479
Caption: um and the closing div

00:39:32.399 --> 00:39:36.479
Caption: oh don&#39;t you wish i&#39;d installed prettier

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:42.959
Caption: okay so this is now just missing this

00:39:40.479 --> 00:39:44.560
Caption: handle count change um how to handle

00:39:42.959 --> 00:39:48.239
Caption: count change is kind of a weird name for

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.239
Caption: a prop so let&#39;s just call it on change

00:39:49.118 --> 00:39:53.199
Caption: all right so now that&#39;s all good we can

00:39:51.358 --> 00:39:56.078
Caption: go back up here we can change this to

00:39:53.199 --> 00:39:58.639
Caption: our number input we can pass it the on

00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:58.640
Caption: change

00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:05.199
Caption: um and then we can get rid of all of

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.320
Caption: this

00:40:05.199 --> 00:40:07.760
Caption: this is my

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:11.199
Caption: more favorite thing than refactoring is

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.800
Caption: deleting code

00:40:11.199 --> 00:40:14.560
Caption: um and our snapshot test will pass so

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.199
Caption: that&#39;s all good everything

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.119
Caption: is great um and now we&#39;re actually ready

00:40:17.199 --> 00:40:21.760
Caption: to write our feature

00:40:19.118 --> 00:40:23.358
Caption: um except one small thing before i did

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.199
Caption: that like i said i don&#39;t like having

00:40:23.358 --> 00:40:27.439
Caption: snapshot tests as the basis for my

00:40:25.199 --> 00:40:28.879
Caption: feature tests um we could go with that

00:40:27.439 --> 00:40:30.319
Caption: but what we have here is sort of

00:40:28.879 --> 00:40:32.078
Caption: snapshot tests that cover the whole

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.680
Caption: product component we don&#39;t have any

00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:36.320
Caption: tests that are specific

00:40:33.679 --> 00:40:37.919
Caption: to our new number input component so i

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:40.880
Caption: would start by actually replicating our

00:40:37.919 --> 00:40:42.479
Caption: snapshot tests into like a specific set

00:40:40.879 --> 00:40:44.399
Caption: of tests for the number

00:40:42.479 --> 00:40:47.118
Caption: the number input i&#39;m not going to make

00:40:44.399 --> 00:40:50.399
Caption: you watch me do that though

00:40:47.118 --> 00:40:51.760
Caption: um i have a set of tests here already

00:40:50.399 --> 00:40:53.838
Caption: um you can see they&#39;re the same

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.959
Caption: scenarios that we wrote before

00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:57.040
Caption: for the two different types and the

00:40:54.959 --> 00:40:59.598
Caption: amount and no amount and then one

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.119
Caption: additional test which checks that will

00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:02.400
Caption: be on change handler because now that

00:41:01.118 --> 00:41:03.919
Caption: these two things are separated out we

00:41:02.399 --> 00:41:06.559
Caption: just need to test that integration is

00:41:03.919 --> 00:41:07.520
Caption: working

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.280
Caption: um

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.719
Caption: now you might argue that this is a waste

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.319
Caption: of time we already had these tests i

00:41:10.719 --> 00:41:13.760
Caption: don&#39;t need to do all this and i look i

00:41:12.319 --> 00:41:15.119
Caption: don&#39;t know how busy you are but i did

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.118
Caption: time myself when i wrote this test

00:41:15.118 --> 00:41:20.318
Caption: initially and it took four minutes

00:41:17.118 --> 00:41:23.279
Caption: so it&#39;s like just gotta those copy and

00:41:20.319 --> 00:41:25.359
Caption: paste fingers going fast

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.640
Caption: okay so now we&#39;ve got these tests here

00:41:25.358 --> 00:41:28.318
Caption: we&#39;re ready to write the test for our

00:41:26.639 --> 00:41:29.919
Caption: new feature

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.800
Caption: which honestly is going to look just

00:41:29.919 --> 00:41:32.239
Caption: like

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.319
Caption: the existing ones except we&#39;re going to

00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:36.079
Caption: replace

00:41:34.319 --> 00:41:39.359
Caption: everything with plants so when the

00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:41.200
Caption: product type is plants

00:41:39.358 --> 00:41:43.838
Caption: it&#39;s going to be plants

00:41:41.199 --> 00:41:45.118
Caption: it&#39;s going to show the number of

00:41:43.839 --> 00:41:46.880
Caption: plants

00:41:45.118 --> 00:41:50.799
Caption: and plants as i&#39;m sure you all remember

00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:53.598
Caption: from the spec cost 15 each

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.959
Caption: and again we&#39;re going to make plants

00:41:53.599 --> 00:41:56.319
Caption: we&#39;re going to have 12 of them we&#39;re

00:41:54.959 --> 00:42:00.239
Caption: going to make plants

00:41:56.319 --> 00:42:01.440
Caption: and 15 times 12 is of course

00:42:00.239 --> 00:42:03.839
Caption: anyone no

00:42:01.439 --> 00:42:06.000
Caption: 180 yeah

00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:07.920
Caption: um we run those tests they fail because

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.760
Caption: we haven&#39;t written that code

00:42:07.919 --> 00:42:11.679
Caption: but now when we actually go to write our

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.199
Caption: feature it&#39;s going to be

00:42:11.679 --> 00:42:16.959
Caption: so easy

00:42:13.199 --> 00:42:19.358
Caption: all we need to do is add plants to our

00:42:16.959 --> 00:42:21.199
Caption: little names here

00:42:19.358 --> 00:42:23.679
Caption: and then there&#39;s a little config file

00:42:21.199 --> 00:42:25.760
Caption: here that has the prices in it and we

00:42:23.679 --> 00:42:28.000
Caption: can add the plants here

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.520
Caption: and our tests will pass so how fast was

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.118
Caption: that after we did that refactoring so

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.599
Caption: this component is now super easy to

00:42:31.118 --> 00:42:36.000
Caption: change super easy to work with

00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:37.839
Caption: okay so what did we learn today some

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.358
Caption: important things we learned to think

00:42:37.839 --> 00:42:41.040
Caption: about when we should refactor because

00:42:39.358 --> 00:42:42.318
Caption: even though it&#39;s fun sometimes we maybe

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.040
Caption: shouldn&#39;t do it

00:42:42.319 --> 00:42:44.640
Caption: we&#39;ve learned how to write

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.400
Caption: characterization tests to ensure our

00:42:44.639 --> 00:42:48.078
Caption: refractors are safe

00:42:46.399 --> 00:42:49.199
Caption: um we&#39;ve learned about snapshot tests

00:42:48.079 --> 00:42:51.359
Caption: and how we can use those to write

00:42:49.199 --> 00:42:53.040
Caption: refactoring tests and most importantly

00:42:51.358 --> 00:42:55.279
Caption: of all we learned that this thing that

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:56.479
Caption: looks like actually pronounced the and

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.000
Caption: that&#39;s what a thorn sort of looks like

00:42:56.479 --> 00:43:00.319

Caption: i did a talk at the brisbane data

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:33.039
Caption: science meetup one of my favorites hi

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.879
Caption: enrique if you&#39;re watching online um

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:37.120

Caption: with kind of a speed

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.439
Caption: chart redesign

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:41.120
Caption: uh

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:42.560
Caption: that is on youtube as well at a

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.759
Caption: conference called data edge bytes you

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.439
Caption: might have heard of it

01:08:43.758 --> 01:08:47.278
Caption: really really cool conference also not

Caption: and i admit uh i i did give it give a

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:57.439
Caption: talk on uh inclusive presentations uh at

01:08:54.159 --> 01:09:00.319
Caption: uh fenders on wednesday um

01:08:57.439 --> 01:09:02.318
Caption: those talks were uh not the most not the

01:09:00.318 --> 01:09:04.838
Caption: most accessible talk so i&#39;m always

01:09:02.318 --> 01:09:07.838
Caption: learning along the way

01:09:04.838 --> 01:09:08.718
Caption: um and uh so

01:09:07.838 --> 01:09:10.718
Caption: um

Caption: i won&#39;t be covering a whole lot of very

01:09:10.719 --> 01:09:17.040
Caption: in-depth kind of accessibility data vis

01:09:14.879 --> 01:09:18.718
Caption: basics today

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:20.318
Caption: but if you want to kind of learn more

01:09:18.719 --> 01:09:22.560
Caption: and find out kind of the details please

01:09:20.318 --> 01:09:24.158
Caption: i&#39;ve got a bunch of resources at the end

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:25.279
Caption: um

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:27.120
Caption: that

01:09:25.278 --> 01:09:29.278
Caption: that you can go and have a look at if if

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:30.080
Caption: this is interesting to you and helpful

01:09:29.278 --> 01:09:31.198
Caption: to you

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.520
Caption: um

01:09:31.199 --> 01:09:34.799
Caption: so the talk that i did the meet up in

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:36.239
Caption: brisbane was called inclusive

01:09:34.798 --> 01:09:38.798
Caption: storytelling with data and it only

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:40.238
Caption: focused on static charts or images of

01:09:38.798 --> 01:09:41.758
Caption: charts so i didn&#39;t talk about the

01:09:40.238 --> 01:09:43.439
Caption: interaction at all and i made a big

01:09:41.758 --> 01:09:45.520
Caption: promise that i would do a follow-up one

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:47.838
Caption: about dynamic charts and here i am two

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:49.838
Caption: years later

01:09:47.838 --> 01:09:52.879
Caption: and so this is a bit of a reprise of

01:09:49.838 --> 01:09:54.560
Caption: that talk and i&#39;m very very excited

01:09:52.879 --> 01:09:57.919
Caption: uh

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.800
Caption: i think i have internet but um

01:09:57.919 --> 01:10:01.520
Caption: so

01:09:58.799 --> 01:10:04.158
Caption: uh the big kind of trigger for this

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.760
Caption: topic and the big light bulb moment for

01:10:04.159 --> 01:10:08.159
Caption: me was reading a book called

01:10:05.759 --> 01:10:10.799
Caption: storytelling with data um

01:10:08.159 --> 01:10:12.640
Caption: by cole nassbaumer netflix

01:10:10.799 --> 01:10:14.238
Caption: amazing amazing

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.360
Caption: database

01:10:14.238 --> 01:10:18.079
Caption: expert who worked at google um and ended

01:10:17.359 --> 01:10:19.678
Caption: up

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.879
Caption: her whole job being teaching people how

01:10:19.679 --> 01:10:22.400
Caption: to communicate better with data at

01:10:20.879 --> 01:10:24.319
Caption: google um

01:10:22.399 --> 01:10:27.279
Caption: and i really really recommend reading

01:10:24.319 --> 01:10:29.198
Caption: that book before anything else uh really

01:10:27.279 --> 01:10:30.479
Caption: a really awesome book on the kind of

01:10:29.199 --> 01:10:33.040
Caption: basics of design

01:10:30.479 --> 01:10:34.020
Caption: and data communication

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.120
Caption: and

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:36.640
Caption: [Music]

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.879
Caption: if you want to make accessible data

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.479
Caption: visualizations as that book will mention

01:10:38.879 --> 01:10:42.000
Caption: you do need to learn a little bit about

01:10:40.479 --> 01:10:44.080
Caption: design

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.279
Caption: a well-designed data visualization is

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:49.439
Caption: easy to interpret and understand and

01:10:47.279 --> 01:10:52.399
Caption: good design takes into the account

01:10:49.439 --> 01:10:53.839
Caption: it takes into account the needs of users

01:10:52.399 --> 01:10:55.520
Caption: and some of those users will have

01:10:53.839 --> 01:10:57.119
Caption: disabilities

01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:00.879
Caption: and

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:03.360
Caption: so accessible design is inclusive design

01:11:00.879 --> 01:11:06.000
Caption: and inclusive design is the key to good

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:08.718
Caption: design uh where it considers not only

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.279
Caption: disability but language culture gender

01:11:08.719 --> 01:11:12.560
Caption: age and other forms of human difference

01:11:11.279 --> 01:11:13.919
Caption: if you haven&#39;t heard of inclusive design

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.600
Caption: before

01:11:13.919 --> 01:11:18.479
Caption: there&#39;s a

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.600
Caption: very often uh very very popular diagram

01:11:18.479 --> 01:11:20.799
Caption: that i&#39;ve got on the screen at the

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.640
Caption: moment

01:11:20.799 --> 01:11:24.718
Caption: about inclusive design from microsoft

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.880
Caption: you may have seen it before or you may

01:11:24.719 --> 01:11:28.880
Caption: have known of it before so it&#39;s a table

01:11:26.879 --> 01:11:30.319
Caption: with three column and four rows

01:11:28.879 --> 01:11:32.399
Caption: and the columns

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:34.319
Caption: refer to examples of permanent temporary

01:11:32.399 --> 01:11:36.640
Caption: and situational disability

01:11:34.319 --> 01:11:39.119
Caption: uh and the rows refer to sensors such as

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.800
Caption: uh human senses such as motor vision

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.040
Caption: hearing and speech

01:11:40.799 --> 01:11:44.799
Caption: so an example in the in the diagram is a

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:46.799
Caption: permanent motor disability is maybe an

01:11:44.799 --> 01:11:48.879
Caption: amputee with a missing arm

01:11:46.799 --> 01:11:50.799
Caption: and while a temporary motor disability

01:11:48.879 --> 01:11:53.919
Caption: is having a broken arm and a situational

01:11:50.799 --> 01:11:55.040
Caption: disability is perhaps a parent carrying

01:11:53.919 --> 01:11:57.198
Caption: a newborn

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:59.280
Caption: um and you can come up with your own

01:11:57.199 --> 01:12:00.640
Caption: examples for the others uh the goal of

01:11:59.279 --> 01:12:02.799
Caption: this graphic is to illustrate that if

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.520
Caption: disability is viewed as a mismatch

01:12:02.799 --> 01:12:07.040
Caption: between a person that disability&#39;s views

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.479
Caption: can be viewed as a mismatch between a

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:10.479
Caption: person and their environment the

01:12:08.479 --> 01:12:12.879
Caption: environment is actually just disabling

01:12:10.479 --> 01:12:15.120
Caption: the person

01:12:12.879 --> 01:12:17.919
Caption: and designing for disability actually

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:20.080
Caption: benefits everybody

01:12:17.919 --> 01:12:22.640
Caption: so to design a chart accessibly

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:25.280
Caption: accessibly will help your database be

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.479
Caption: understood by more and more people um if

01:12:25.279 --> 01:12:27.839
Caption: you want to learn more about inclusive

01:12:26.479 --> 01:12:29.199
Caption: design please please do check out

01:12:27.839 --> 01:12:30.959
Caption: microsoft&#39;s

01:12:29.199 --> 01:12:34.880
Caption: inclusive design toolkit and i believe

01:12:30.959 --> 01:12:34.879
Caption: they are also a sponsor of ddd perth

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:38.239
Caption: so uh

01:12:36.479 --> 01:12:40.000
Caption: one thing i do want to note um and a

01:12:38.238 --> 01:12:42.000
Caption: common misconception if you are new to

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.319
Caption: accessibility is accessibility is not

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.600
Caption: one size fits all it&#39;s not trying to

01:12:44.319 --> 01:12:48.718
Caption: kind of craft uh everyone to go through

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.840
Caption: the same

01:12:48.719 --> 01:12:54.239
Caption: ui flow

01:12:51.839 --> 01:12:58.080
Caption: it is providing multiple pathways that

01:12:54.238 --> 01:13:01.599
Caption: not every user might kind of take

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.600
Caption: so an example is

01:13:02.839 --> 01:13:09.520
Caption: um uh brain freeze um so for for the

01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:11.439
Caption: example of data visualizations uh

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.959
Caption: folks might prefer that visual folks

01:13:11.439 --> 01:13:17.520
Caption: might prefer to look at a chart um or a

01:13:14.959 --> 01:13:19.279
Caption: data visualization and maybe people who

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.959
Caption: prefer uh looking at the data and

01:13:19.279 --> 01:13:23.359
Caption: understanding the data would prefer to

01:13:20.959 --> 01:13:25.120
Caption: have a table presented to them instead

01:13:23.359 --> 01:13:27.198
Caption: so that they can do their own analysis

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.879
Caption: on the data um so that is a that is an

01:13:27.199 --> 01:13:30.560
Caption: example of being flexible and providing

01:13:28.879 --> 01:13:34.479
Caption: multiple pathways for the same outcome

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:37.839
Caption: you want people to understand or to

01:13:34.479 --> 01:13:37.839
Caption: consume your data

01:13:38.959 --> 01:13:42.238
Caption: and so

01:13:40.959 --> 01:13:44.799
Caption: one of the big

01:13:42.238 --> 01:13:46.479
Caption: problems is that

01:13:44.799 --> 01:13:47.919
Caption: and and the reason for kind of kicking

01:13:46.479 --> 01:13:50.640
Caption: off this

01:13:47.919 --> 01:13:52.399
Caption: talk and this uh

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.840
Caption: kind of meetup group in data

01:13:52.399 --> 01:13:56.319
Caption: visualization is there&#39;s not a whole lot

01:13:53.839 --> 01:13:58.639
Caption: of resources out there to

01:13:56.319 --> 01:13:59.678
Caption: uh or there wasn&#39;t there is now actually

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.640
Caption: um

01:13:59.679 --> 01:14:06.000
Caption: to learn how to make the interactive

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:07.760
Caption: dynamic database accessible and what i

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.359
Caption: mean by that is

01:14:07.759 --> 01:14:13.599
Caption: most data visualizations

01:14:11.359 --> 01:14:14.718
Caption: able to be accessed using a mouse

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.040
Caption: and

01:14:14.719 --> 01:14:18.560
Caption: and for sighted folks but if it when it

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.120
Caption: comes down to people who cannot use a

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.919
Caption: mouse they only use the keyboard maybe

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:25.360
Caption: or people who use screen readers

01:14:23.919 --> 01:14:29.439
Caption: they

01:14:25.359 --> 01:14:33.198
Caption: are not able to look at the data at all

01:14:29.439 --> 01:14:33.198
Caption: and so i have a video from

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.080
Caption: a

01:14:34.319 --> 01:14:38.079
Caption: a talk kind of on a 101 data

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.839
Caption: visualization just to show an example

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.760
Caption: and hopefully it plays

01:14:39.839 --> 01:14:44.479
Caption: of what it is like for a screen reader

01:14:41.759 --> 01:14:45.599
Caption: user to access a an inaccessible chart

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:49.199
Caption: so

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:51.520
Caption: um a lot of this blew up because uh

01:14:49.199 --> 01:14:54.239
Caption: when when kind of covered

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:56.959
Caption: began it was also the u.s election and

01:14:54.238 --> 01:14:59.359
Caption: so there was an incredible amount of

01:14:56.959 --> 01:15:02.080
Caption: data visualization and especially kind

01:14:59.359 --> 01:15:04.000
Caption: of um the advancements and also data

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:07.120
Caption: visualization libraries kind of anybody

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.879
Caption: could kind of put together a um

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.560
Caption: a really shiny looking data

01:15:08.879 --> 01:15:12.399
Caption: visualization

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:14.159
Caption: or something that&#39;s super interactive

01:15:12.399 --> 01:15:16.718
Caption: and super cool which they were but

01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:17.920
Caption: unfortunately

01:15:16.719 --> 01:15:20.920
Caption: they weren&#39;t the best experience for

01:15:17.919 --> 01:15:20.919
Caption: everyone

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.479
Caption: on internet

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.120
Caption: something else that&#39;s more technical is

01:15:28.479 --> 01:15:33.040
Caption: making it work for a screen reader

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.560
Caption: screen reader such as for example

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.000
Caption: voiceover for mac

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.319
Caption: they will read what&#39;s displayed on the

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.640
Caption: page and unless you&#39;re using a database

01:15:38.319 --> 01:15:42.959
Caption: library that already puts a lot of focus

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.560
Caption: in screen reader accessibility you will

01:15:42.959 --> 01:15:45.759
Caption: have to do quite a bit of technical work

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.000
Caption: there yourself

01:15:45.759 --> 01:15:50.559
Caption: let&#39;s take a look at an example

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.399
Caption: this is from fox news

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:54.319
Caption: during the elections they had a page

01:15:52.399 --> 01:15:56.238
Caption: that live updated as the electoral

01:15:54.319 --> 01:15:58.560
Caption: college votes given

01:15:56.238 --> 01:15:59.678
Caption: and the progress bar underneath

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:02.560
Caption: would show

01:15:59.679 --> 01:16:04.479
Caption: how many votes from each states each of

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:07.760
Caption: the candidates had gathered already and

01:16:04.479 --> 01:16:09.600
Caption: how close they were to getting the 270

01:16:07.759 --> 01:16:11.119
Caption: that they needed to win

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.560
Caption: however

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:15.199
Caption: let&#39;s listen to what it&#39;s like for a

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:18.800
Caption: screen reader

01:16:15.199 --> 01:16:22.159

01:16:45.439 --> 01:16:48.000
Caption: i think you get the idea that goes on

01:16:46.719 --> 01:16:49.760
Caption: for another five minutes so i&#39;m not

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.640
Caption: going to

01:16:49.759 --> 01:16:53.839
Caption: keep that one playing

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.120
Caption: oops

01:16:53.839 --> 01:16:57.040
Caption: oh

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.719
Caption: apologies

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.719
Caption: okay

01:16:58.719 --> 01:17:03.199
Caption: um so

01:17:00.719 --> 01:17:04.000
Caption: as you could probably hear uh that was

01:17:03.199 --> 01:17:05.520
Caption: not

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.479
Caption: a terribly good experience for screen

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:11.199
Caption: reader users uh it it was even kind of

01:17:08.479 --> 01:17:12.640
Caption: lucky that that particular uh data

01:17:11.199 --> 01:17:14.800
Caption: visualization or that website actually

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:18.159
Caption: had some labels on the data so that you

01:17:14.799 --> 01:17:19.198
Caption: could hear votes votes votes how many

01:17:18.159 --> 01:17:21.760
Caption: votes

01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:24.880
Caption: often it&#39;s just image image image image

01:17:21.759 --> 01:17:26.639
Caption: image or something else

01:17:24.879 --> 01:17:30.158
Caption: so

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:32.320
Caption: how do we make an accessible html chart

01:17:30.159 --> 01:17:33.760
Caption: so luckily in the last few years

01:17:32.319 --> 01:17:36.158
Caption: one particular company has made it

01:17:33.759 --> 01:17:36.959
Caption: really really easy

01:17:36.159 --> 01:17:38.640
Caption: so

01:17:36.959 --> 01:17:40.479
Caption: the

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:42.640
Caption: the advice that i have is

01:17:40.479 --> 01:17:44.718
Caption: use the high charts javascript charting

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.320
Caption: library and add a couple of

01:17:44.719 --> 01:17:48.400
Caption: accessibility modules that they include

01:17:46.319 --> 01:17:50.799
Caption: in there and that&#39;s it that&#39;s the end of

01:17:48.399 --> 01:17:50.799
Caption: my talk

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:57.600
Caption: but jokes aside unless you have a really

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.800
Caption: really giant development team

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.479
Caption: you probably don&#39;t want to be writing

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:02.079
Caption: your own database library

01:18:00.479 --> 01:18:03.120
Caption: unless you really need to

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:05.439
Caption: especially if you want to make it

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.679
Caption: accessible it is quite easy to kind of

01:18:05.439 --> 01:18:09.198
Caption: get it to the mouse hover point

01:18:07.679 --> 01:18:10.640
Caption: where you can have tool tips showing on

01:18:09.199 --> 01:18:12.640
Caption: mouse hover

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:14.000
Caption: but there is quite a bit more work to do

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.880
Caption: after that

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.879
Caption: um

01:18:14.879 --> 01:18:18.238
Caption: and high charts isn&#39;t the only library

01:18:16.879 --> 01:18:20.879
Caption: out there but is one of the most fully

01:18:18.238 --> 01:18:22.639
Caption: featured and best developer experiences

01:18:20.879 --> 01:18:25.359
Caption: i found other libraries that you may

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.479
Caption: have heard of such as am charts

01:18:25.359 --> 01:18:28.238
Caption: couldn&#39;t quite

01:18:26.479 --> 01:18:31.839
Caption: work out as easily how to get the

01:18:28.238 --> 01:18:31.839
Caption: accessibility module going in that

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:40.159
Caption: and

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:41.359
Caption: so a few years ago i built a dynamic

01:18:40.159 --> 01:18:44.479
Caption: chart when i worked for a logging

01:18:41.359 --> 01:18:46.080
Caption: company so on the screen i have

01:18:44.479 --> 01:18:47.919
Caption: a

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.600
Caption: column chart there and this chart is to

01:18:47.919 --> 01:18:52.839
Caption: show effective log retention how

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:55.919
Caption: effective log retention policies are

01:18:52.839 --> 01:18:58.319
Caption: um uh on keeping kind of disk space to a

01:18:55.919 --> 01:19:01.359
Caption: maintainable level um

01:18:58.319 --> 01:19:04.639
Caption: so uh it was a column chart that ended

01:19:01.359 --> 01:19:06.238
Caption: up being at least keyboard accessible um

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.159
Caption: and uh this was kind of working with the

01:19:06.238 --> 01:19:09.678
Caption: knowledge i i had at the time i was

01:19:08.159 --> 01:19:11.040
Caption: still learning and still trying to

01:19:09.679 --> 01:19:12.560
Caption: understand what makes an accessible data

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.879
Caption: visualization

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:17.199
Caption: a dynamic one

01:19:14.879 --> 01:19:19.520
Caption: and i had a really good crack at making

01:19:17.199 --> 01:19:20.800
Caption: it screen reader accessible

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.959
Caption: but it was probably a horrendous

01:19:20.799 --> 01:19:24.879
Caption: experience for them

01:19:22.959 --> 01:19:27.040
Caption: similar to kind of the

01:19:24.879 --> 01:19:28.479
Caption: video that i just played and

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:29.839
Caption: unfortunately it wasn&#39;t tested with real

01:19:28.479 --> 01:19:31.759
Caption: users which

01:19:29.839 --> 01:19:33.599
Caption: is really really important and and

01:19:31.759 --> 01:19:38.000
Caption: absolutely

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:40.000
Caption: must must do uh so on the screen as a

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.319
Caption: thing most of you all of you cannot see

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.199
Caption: because it&#39;s tiny font um

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:46.718
Caption: is

01:19:43.199 --> 01:19:49.040
Caption: the accessibility tree of the chart that

01:19:46.719 --> 01:19:53.040
Caption: i just displayed and

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:53.040
Caption: um i actually can&#39;t even read it

01:19:53.359 --> 01:19:58.718
Caption: and what i&#39;m trying to demonstrate in

01:19:55.359 --> 01:20:00.718
Caption: this screenshot is um that i added aria

01:19:58.719 --> 01:20:01.840
Caption: labels to each of those bars or each of

01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:06.080
Caption: those columns

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:08.238
Caption: and it was really repetitive the first

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:11.359
Caption: the first part of the a

01:20:08.238 --> 01:20:13.198
Caption: label was the same for every single

01:20:11.359 --> 01:20:14.959
Caption: bar and so for a screen reader user

01:20:13.199 --> 01:20:17.679
Caption: who&#39;s trying to cycle through

01:20:14.959 --> 01:20:20.000
Caption: all of the data in the chart uh they

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:22.239
Caption: will just hear the same first five words

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.359
Caption: for the um

01:20:22.238 --> 01:20:26.959
Caption: for the chart and then only the uh

01:20:25.359 --> 01:20:29.919
Caption: only the numbers changed at the very end

01:20:26.959 --> 01:20:31.359
Caption: of the sentence so uh past me was trying

01:20:29.919 --> 01:20:34.000
Caption: to be descriptive

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:36.399
Caption: and but unfortunately it made it a quite

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.560
Caption: a bad experience so that&#39;s one example

01:20:36.399 --> 01:20:40.319
Caption: of why it&#39;s so important to test with

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:41.919
Caption: actual screen reader users

01:20:40.319 --> 01:20:44.560
Caption: um

01:20:41.919 --> 01:20:46.479
Caption: apologies if the internet is going to

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:50.640
Caption: load um

01:20:46.479 --> 01:20:52.238
Caption: so alternatively so i did that in d3.js

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:54.959
Caption: um i&#39;ve completely forgotten how to use

01:20:52.238 --> 01:20:56.959
Caption: d3.js and it keeps happening every time

01:20:54.959 --> 01:20:59.040
Caption: d3js is like a library that helps you

01:20:56.959 --> 01:21:01.359
Caption: build svgs uh

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:03.120
Caption: easier um

01:21:01.359 --> 01:21:04.718
Caption: so alternatively a bunch of research

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.719
Caption: user testing has gone into the high

01:21:04.719 --> 01:21:08.800
Caption: charts products and uh the head of

01:21:06.719 --> 01:21:10.400
Caption: accessibility and another um co-worker

01:21:08.799 --> 01:21:12.559
Caption: of his actually joined the database

01:21:10.399 --> 01:21:14.799
Caption: accessibility group that we virtually

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:18.080
Caption: met up with once a month and they were

01:21:14.799 --> 01:21:20.158
Caption: so cool so i&#39;m a huge fan um

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.679
Caption: and so they&#39;ve done

01:21:20.159 --> 01:21:23.679
Caption: a bunch of work so that you don&#39;t have

01:21:21.679 --> 01:21:24.880
Caption: to so if you&#39;re not already sold on

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:26.640
Caption: using high charts it&#39;s really

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:27.678
Caption: customizable they haven&#39;t paid me for

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:29.280
Caption: this

01:21:27.679 --> 01:21:31.920
Caption: it&#39;s just they&#39;ve made it really really

01:21:29.279 --> 01:21:33.839
Caption: easy and nice experience and and it&#39;s

01:21:31.919 --> 01:21:36.238
Caption: pretty accessible still do usability

01:21:33.839 --> 01:21:36.238
Caption: testing

01:21:37.279 --> 01:21:39.839
Caption: so

01:21:38.879 --> 01:21:41.040
Caption: you do still have to do some

01:21:39.839 --> 01:21:43.839
Caption: configuration but you don&#39;t have to

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.839
Caption: build it from scratch

01:21:44.479 --> 01:21:48.479
Caption: all right so let&#39;s make a graph

01:21:49.759 --> 01:21:52.479
Caption: but

01:21:50.719 --> 01:21:55.040
Caption: first i wanted to talk to you

01:21:52.479 --> 01:21:56.879
Caption: quickly just just through

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:58.159
Caption: graphs that are images just to start off

01:21:56.879 --> 01:22:00.560
Caption: with

01:21:58.159 --> 01:22:03.840
Caption: and then we&#39;ll move on into html charts

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:05.760
Caption: so on the screen i have an image of a

01:22:03.839 --> 01:22:07.839
Caption: line graph

01:22:05.759 --> 01:22:10.079
Caption: there&#39;s three lines three data series or

01:22:07.839 --> 01:22:11.520
Caption: three lines on it

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:13.919
Caption: you might be able to see that there&#39;s

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:15.279
Caption: jaws nvda and voiceover so we&#39;re talking

01:22:13.919 --> 01:22:17.120
Caption: about three different types of screen

01:22:15.279 --> 01:22:19.359
Caption: readers and

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:20.560
Caption: there&#39;s a y-axis and an x-axis axis and

01:22:19.359 --> 01:22:22.479
Caption: you&#39;re probably already picking up that

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.479
Caption: there are a few things missing from this

01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:26.399
Caption: chart if you are into data

01:22:24.479 --> 01:22:28.238
Caption: um

01:22:26.399 --> 01:22:29.919
Caption: so um

01:22:28.238 --> 01:22:32.559
Caption: there are a few steps to kind of begin

01:22:29.919 --> 01:22:34.959
Caption: with to make the chart accessible

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.639
Caption: so a little quick checklist of checks

01:22:34.959 --> 01:22:39.040
Caption: that we can do for a static image which

01:22:36.639 --> 01:22:40.639
Caption: also kind of carry on to dynamic charts

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:42.080
Caption: or html charts so we&#39;ve got to get these

01:22:40.639 --> 01:22:43.679
Caption: ones right first and then we can make it

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:45.040
Caption: interactive

01:22:43.679 --> 01:22:47.199
Caption: so

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.639
Caption: i&#39;ve kind of split it into three

01:22:47.199 --> 01:22:50.159
Caption: three different categories the first

01:22:48.639 --> 01:22:52.719
Caption: test is content

01:22:50.159 --> 01:22:53.840
Caption: and i usually do this first because uh

01:22:52.719 --> 01:22:56.000
Caption: thinking about the content and how to

01:22:53.839 --> 01:22:56.959
Caption: make the content accessible and uh cole

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.879
Caption: talks a lot about this in the

01:22:56.959 --> 01:23:01.279
Caption: storytelling we&#39;ve done a book you might

01:22:58.879 --> 01:23:02.638
Caption: end up changing the chart completely and

01:23:01.279 --> 01:23:04.079
Caption: you don&#39;t want to kind of work on all

01:23:02.639 --> 01:23:04.959
Caption: the other accessibility parts of the

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.399
Caption: chart

01:23:04.959 --> 01:23:08.399
Caption: and then end up changing the chart and

01:23:06.399 --> 01:23:10.319
Caption: then having to go through and

01:23:08.399 --> 01:23:12.238
Caption: work through all the rest of the visual

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:13.599
Caption: and non-visual accessibility needs of

01:23:12.238 --> 01:23:14.959
Caption: the chart after that

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.760
Caption: um

01:23:14.959 --> 01:23:21.198
Caption: so making sure that there&#39;s a title

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:23.919
Caption: uh a descriptive title even and axes are

01:23:21.199 --> 01:23:26.239
Caption: labeled appropriately and uh one thing

01:23:23.919 --> 01:23:28.238
Caption: uh is number formatting making it a nice

01:23:26.238 --> 01:23:30.879
Caption: experience putting commas making sure

01:23:28.238 --> 01:23:32.559
Caption: units are correct uh making the chart uh

01:23:30.879 --> 01:23:35.120
Caption: and reducing the cognitive load for

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:36.639
Caption: anyone looking or

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:38.159
Caption: inspecting the chart

01:23:36.639 --> 01:23:40.880
Caption: the next test after that is visual

01:23:38.159 --> 01:23:42.239
Caption: testing so uh the things that probably

01:23:40.879 --> 01:23:43.678
Caption: we&#39;re all

01:23:42.238 --> 01:23:45.359
Caption: kind of think of first when we think of

01:23:43.679 --> 01:23:47.600
Caption: accessibility of charts is contrast

01:23:45.359 --> 01:23:48.479
Caption: making sure the contrast is okay meets

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:51.520
Caption: um

01:23:48.479 --> 01:23:53.199
Caption: the kind of uh usual requirements

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:55.839
Caption: if you&#39;re familiar with wikag or the web

01:23:53.199 --> 01:23:58.400
Caption: content accessibility guidelines um but

01:23:55.839 --> 01:24:03.198
Caption: in in summary just has to kind of not be

01:23:58.399 --> 01:24:03.198
Caption: bright yellow or a really light pastel

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.760
Caption: and

01:24:04.319 --> 01:24:08.000
Caption: making sure that we&#39;re not relying

01:24:05.759 --> 01:24:10.079
Caption: solely on color or giving the option to

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.159
Caption: be able to you know add patterns to the

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:14.159
Caption: chart

01:24:12.159 --> 01:24:17.040
Caption: that&#39;s that alternative pathways again

01:24:14.159 --> 01:24:18.800
Caption: if someone can use color then um

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.560
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s fine but making sure that

01:24:18.799 --> 01:24:21.919
Caption: we provide the other the other

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.239
Caption: alternative

01:24:21.919 --> 01:24:25.919
Caption: um and and a font is a big one is to

01:24:24.238 --> 01:24:28.879
Caption: making sure that the font is legible not

01:24:25.919 --> 01:24:32.399
Caption: using like very fancy arty fonts sans

01:24:28.879 --> 01:24:34.238
Caption: serif or the uh the ariel or helvetica

01:24:32.399 --> 01:24:38.000
Caption: or anything that doesn&#39;t have the little

01:24:34.238 --> 01:24:39.919
Caption: extra bits on on parts of the font um

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.359
Caption: uh

01:24:39.919 --> 01:24:42.959
Caption: more accessible to folks who may have

01:24:41.359 --> 01:24:44.479
Caption: dyslexia

01:24:42.959 --> 01:24:47.439
Caption: um

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:48.560
Caption: and uh and uh finally non-visual making

01:24:47.439 --> 01:24:50.718
Caption: sure that the

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:52.719
Caption: uh chart has alternative text or an

01:24:50.719 --> 01:24:54.400
Caption: image description um you might be

01:24:52.719 --> 01:24:58.600
Caption: familiar with this in html is adding the

01:24:54.399 --> 01:24:58.600
Caption: alt tag on the image element

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:04.000
Caption: so

01:25:02.159 --> 01:25:06.560
Caption: um

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.639
Caption: writing uh so one of the hardest bits is

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:11.919
Caption: writing alt text for charts

01:25:08.639 --> 01:25:13.760
Caption: but someone in the database community

01:25:11.919 --> 01:25:16.158
Caption: has written an

01:25:13.759 --> 01:25:18.079
Caption: incredibly awesome article on just

01:25:16.159 --> 01:25:20.080
Caption: giving a simple template to be able to

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:22.159
Caption: just take this template fill in what you

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.600
Caption: need and that&#39;s a really really good

01:25:22.159 --> 01:25:26.400
Caption: description of an image of a chart

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.000
Caption: and

01:25:26.399 --> 01:25:30.319
Caption: usually folks are including images on

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.799
Caption: charts to complement an article that

01:25:30.319 --> 01:25:34.079
Caption: might be um to support some sort of

01:25:32.799 --> 01:25:36.158
Caption: factual point that they are making in

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:37.760
Caption: that article and the chart is not really

01:25:36.159 --> 01:25:41.520
Caption: something that people are actually using

01:25:37.759 --> 01:25:44.479
Caption: to kind of explore or get data from

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:46.000
Caption: so describing what the chart is and

01:25:44.479 --> 01:25:47.759
Caption: something that is really really

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.919
Caption: important is making sure to have a link

01:25:47.759 --> 01:25:52.079
Caption: to the data source that alternative

01:25:49.919 --> 01:25:54.399
Caption: pathways again so a download to a csv

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.080
Caption: file or maybe a html table on another

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:57.040
Caption: page

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:59.520
Caption: so that

01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.799
Caption: if a person is not able to

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.279
Caption: pass the

01:26:00.799 --> 01:26:05.759
Caption: visual chart they can go and

01:26:03.279 --> 01:26:07.198
Caption: inspect the data themselves

01:26:05.759 --> 01:26:08.959
Caption: if they would like

01:26:07.199 --> 01:26:12.639
Caption: so

01:26:08.959 --> 01:26:14.238
Caption: even if you have an interactive chart uh

01:26:12.639 --> 01:26:15.840
Caption: if you&#39;re not quite sure how to make it

01:26:14.238 --> 01:26:17.439
Caption: accessible with all the keyboard and all

01:26:15.839 --> 01:26:18.879
Caption: the javascript and

01:26:17.439 --> 01:26:20.879
Caption: all the screen reader stuff what you can

01:26:18.879 --> 01:26:22.399
Caption: do is kind of wrap this chart wrap the

01:26:20.879 --> 01:26:23.759
Caption: chart in an image

01:26:22.399 --> 01:26:26.000
Caption: um

01:26:23.759 --> 01:26:27.678
Caption: image roll and give it

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Caption: alt text and then make sure that you

01:26:27.679 --> 01:26:32.479
Caption: have that uh absolutely make sure that

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.080
Caption: you have that um link to the data so

01:26:32.479 --> 01:26:35.679
Caption: that they can download it or inspect it

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:37.760
Caption: in a table so that&#39;s that&#39;s a great

01:26:35.679 --> 01:26:39.520
Caption: start if

01:26:37.759 --> 01:26:40.238
Caption: you&#39;re not quite sure how to how to make

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.679
Caption: it

01:26:40.238 --> 01:26:44.000
Caption: accessible in terms of screen readers

01:26:41.679 --> 01:26:44.000
Caption: and things

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:49.599
Caption: all right and my favorite reminder is if

01:26:47.439 --> 01:26:51.439
Caption: you are tweeting

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.679
Caption: and you&#39;re not aware that you can add

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:54.639
Caption: alternative texts to your dvd perth

01:26:53.679 --> 01:26:57.199
Caption: tweets

01:26:54.639 --> 01:26:59.679
Caption: um i

01:26:57.199 --> 01:27:01.120
Caption: don&#39;t quite remember how to do it

01:26:59.679 --> 01:27:03.440
Caption: but i think when you take a photo

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.840
Caption: there&#39;s a little alt button somewhere on

01:27:03.439 --> 01:27:07.919
Caption: your phone and you can click on that and

01:27:05.839 --> 01:27:09.839
Caption: you can

01:27:07.919 --> 01:27:11.520
Caption: describe your image as well

01:27:09.839 --> 01:27:13.599
Caption: so

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.959
Caption: you may have seen that twitter has also

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.600
Caption: brought out

01:27:14.959 --> 01:27:20.080
Caption: the alt button feature so that you can

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.600
Caption: inspect other people&#39;s alt text uh so if

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:23.199
Caption: you are new to writing alt text it is

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:25.040
Caption: actually not that easy it takes a bit of

01:27:23.199 --> 01:27:27.040
Caption: practice um

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:29.120
Caption: you can kind of cheat and look at what

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:31.600
Caption: other people are describing the images

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:34.320
Caption: as um on twitter without having to you

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:37.840
Caption: know switch on your screen reader um and

01:27:34.319 --> 01:27:37.839
Caption: and try to inspect the image that way

01:27:38.719 --> 01:27:45.199
Caption: all right back to database so

01:27:41.359 --> 01:27:46.718
Caption: how to make accessible html charts

01:27:45.199 --> 01:27:48.479
Caption: um

01:27:46.719 --> 01:27:50.800
Caption: so what if we can&#39;t make do with an

01:27:48.479 --> 01:27:50.799
Caption: image

01:27:52.959 --> 01:27:56.959
Caption: so for example most people

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:59.280
Caption: here probably have

01:27:56.959 --> 01:28:00.639
Caption: a banking or other finance app this is

01:27:59.279 --> 01:28:03.039
Caption: the example that we&#39;re going to go with

01:28:00.639 --> 01:28:03.040
Caption: it&#39;s quite

01:28:03.359 --> 01:28:06.638
Caption: quite a simple one

01:28:05.439 --> 01:28:08.319
Caption: so

01:28:06.639 --> 01:28:10.959
Caption: have you ever thought about what the

01:28:08.319 --> 01:28:14.399
Caption: html or javascript might be behind those

01:28:10.959 --> 01:28:15.600
Caption: charts and i know combank uh

01:28:14.399 --> 01:28:17.198
Caption: i actually haven&#39;t tested it but i&#39;m

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.239
Caption: pretty sure combank&#39;s

01:28:17.199 --> 01:28:20.479
Caption: kind of

01:28:18.238 --> 01:28:22.399
Caption: income outcome that&#39;s not the right

01:28:20.479 --> 01:28:24.959
Caption: words

01:28:22.399 --> 01:28:27.600
Caption: incoming and outgoing expenses are quite

01:28:24.959 --> 01:28:29.679
Caption: accessible yeah

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.840
Caption: and uh

01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:34.400
Caption: um so

01:28:31.839 --> 01:28:35.599
Caption: oh sorry um

01:28:34.399 --> 01:28:37.279
Caption: yeah have you ever thought about like

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.679
Caption: what what is the html that is behind

01:28:37.279 --> 01:28:40.479
Caption: those charts

01:28:39.679 --> 01:28:43.360
Caption: uh

01:28:40.479 --> 01:28:45.040
Caption: but first usually uh

01:28:43.359 --> 01:28:47.119
Caption: we have a table of data whether or not

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:48.799
Caption: it&#39;s in excel or it&#39;s made possibly in a

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:50.320
Caption: json uh

01:28:48.799 --> 01:28:53.119
Caption: payload that&#39;s coming back from some

01:28:50.319 --> 01:28:57.198
Caption: service um you we usually have some data

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:58.320
Caption: in some sort of kind of tabular format

01:28:57.199 --> 01:28:59.840
Caption: and

01:28:58.319 --> 01:29:02.238
Caption: which is handy you should keep this

01:28:59.839 --> 01:29:02.238
Caption: around

01:29:02.479 --> 01:29:07.120
Caption: and now is actually a good time to ask

01:29:04.719 --> 01:29:09.440
Caption: with this table of data

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:12.000
Caption: do we really need a chart for this

01:29:09.439 --> 01:29:13.839
Caption: or can we just leave it as a table and

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.080
Caption: like that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty good

01:29:13.839 --> 01:29:18.799
Caption: these are not real numbers or anything i

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:18.800
Caption: just made them up

01:29:20.879 --> 01:29:24.959
Caption: so if the answer is yes then all you

01:29:23.359 --> 01:29:28.238
Caption: need to do is make sure that the html

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:28.238
Caption: table is is accessible

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:34.159
Caption: and voila a accessible dynamic data

01:29:32.479 --> 01:29:36.080
Caption: visualization

01:29:34.159 --> 01:29:39.679
Caption: so on the screen i have

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:43.439
Caption: a table of data with um

01:29:39.679 --> 01:29:45.920
Caption: two headers of incoming and outgoing um

01:29:43.439 --> 01:29:47.439
Caption: and uh three rows of the months of july

01:29:45.919 --> 01:29:50.879
Caption: august and september

01:29:47.439 --> 01:29:54.560
Caption: and uh some dollar figures um in there

01:29:50.879 --> 01:29:57.678
Caption: and so let&#39;s have a look at how

01:29:54.560 --> 01:30:00.639
Caption: to code this successfully

01:29:57.679 --> 01:30:02.479
Caption: oh that is very small

01:30:00.639 --> 01:30:04.239
Caption: um

01:30:02.479 --> 01:30:05.600
Caption: so i&#39;ll try to talk through it as best

01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:07.359
Caption: that i can

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:10.200
Caption: so

01:30:07.359 --> 01:30:11.919
Caption: just some things to remember is uh so

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:14.639
Caption: [Music]

01:30:11.919 --> 01:30:17.359
Caption: oh firstly the um

01:30:14.639 --> 01:30:19.199
Caption: the quickest way is to head to the wai

01:30:17.359 --> 01:30:21.439
Caption: w3c site and have a look at the tables

01:30:19.199 --> 01:30:23.040
Caption: tutorial has excellent every type of

01:30:21.439 --> 01:30:24.639
Caption: table you can think of like where you

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.239
Caption: have like a header row and a header

01:30:24.639 --> 01:30:28.159
Caption: column or you just have a header row or

01:30:26.238 --> 01:30:29.678
Caption: you have some random

01:30:28.159 --> 01:30:31.760
Caption: headers

01:30:29.679 --> 01:30:32.479
Caption: here there and everywhere

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:34.638
Caption: but

01:30:32.479 --> 01:30:36.560
Caption: the the one thing that i&#39;ve noticed

01:30:34.639 --> 01:30:37.840
Caption: folks forget the most is making sure to

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:41.439
Caption: add scope

01:30:37.839 --> 01:30:43.040
Caption: um to use th when when uh a cell is a

01:30:41.439 --> 01:30:45.520
Caption: header

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.879
Caption: um and using scope equals coal if the

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:49.439
Caption: header is along the top and it&#39;s

01:30:46.879 --> 01:30:51.600
Caption: referring to the column

01:30:49.439 --> 01:30:53.439
Caption: and

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:55.520
Caption: referring to scope equal and adding

01:30:53.439 --> 01:30:59.678
Caption: scope equals row

01:30:55.520 --> 01:31:01.839
Caption: when a cell is a th in the the header of

01:30:59.679 --> 01:31:03.760
Caption: a row so this is a table with a row

01:31:01.839 --> 01:31:04.879
Caption: header and a column header and column

01:31:03.759 --> 01:31:06.638
Caption: headers

01:31:04.879 --> 01:31:08.879
Caption: um

01:31:06.639 --> 01:31:10.959
Caption: and

01:31:08.879 --> 01:31:14.638
Caption: a little bit of kind of extra extra

01:31:10.959 --> 01:31:16.399
Caption: niceties to make numbers easier to read

01:31:14.639 --> 01:31:18.560
Caption: in this table we&#39;ve also

01:31:16.399 --> 01:31:20.638
Caption: added a class to make sure that we right

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:22.560
Caption: align the numbers because it is uh been

01:31:20.639 --> 01:31:24.080
Caption: known and researched that it&#39;s easier to

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.919
Caption: read numbers that are that are right

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:28.080
Caption: aligned

01:31:25.919 --> 01:31:30.639
Caption: um and have commas and and all that good

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:33.600
Caption: ux stuff

01:31:30.639 --> 01:31:33.600
Caption: all right so

01:31:35.199 --> 01:31:39.679
Caption: onto a

01:31:36.799 --> 01:31:41.119
Caption: dynamic data visualize the data

01:31:39.679 --> 01:31:42.400
Caption: visualization

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.879
Caption: so

01:31:42.399 --> 01:31:47.678
Caption: we decided no we don&#39;t want a table we

01:31:44.879 --> 01:31:49.919
Caption: want to go a little bit fancier uh so on

01:31:47.679 --> 01:31:51.600
Caption: the screen i have an interactive chart

01:31:49.919 --> 01:31:52.799
Caption: and um

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:55.679
Caption: you wouldn&#39;t know it but it&#39;s not

01:31:52.799 --> 01:31:58.399
Caption: actually interactive yet

01:31:55.679 --> 01:32:01.440
Caption: so what i&#39;ve got is a link before the

01:31:58.399 --> 01:32:02.799
Caption: chart and a link after the chart

01:32:01.439 --> 01:32:04.639
Caption: i think julie is cringing because i

01:32:02.799 --> 01:32:07.198
Caption: forgot to put underlines in the css to

01:32:04.639 --> 01:32:09.120
Caption: show that they are links apologies and

01:32:07.199 --> 01:32:10.880
Caption: i&#39;ve got a big chart in the middle that

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:14.000
Caption: is a column chart that

01:32:10.879 --> 01:32:16.560
Caption: is the chart uh chart representation of

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.439
Caption: the data uh that we just had in the

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:21.600
Caption: table on the previous slide and so i

01:32:19.439 --> 01:32:24.718
Caption: will uh firstly do start off with using

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:24.719
Caption: keyboard to test

01:32:24.879 --> 01:32:29.198
Caption: so hopefully

01:32:26.719 --> 01:32:29.199
Caption: i can

01:32:30.238 --> 01:32:33.839
Caption: the focus styles will come up

01:32:35.199 --> 01:32:37.920
Caption: they will not

01:32:38.399 --> 01:32:43.678
Caption: maybe if i get out of full screen mode

01:32:41.839 --> 01:32:45.520
Caption: escape

01:32:43.679 --> 01:32:48.800
Caption: all right

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:50.799
Caption: oh the focus styles are very faint

01:32:48.799 --> 01:32:52.799
Caption: that is not great i&#39;m going to switch to

01:32:50.799 --> 01:32:55.198
Caption: chrome apologies

01:32:52.799 --> 01:32:56.879
Caption: uh we will need safari later to test

01:32:55.199 --> 01:32:59.280
Caption: with the screen reader and i will switch

01:32:56.879 --> 01:32:59.279
Caption: to chrome

01:33:07.679 --> 01:33:12.560
Caption: okay

01:33:08.799 --> 01:33:14.879
Caption: and we&#39;re back and hopefully

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:16.800
Caption: there we go uh hopefully those that can

01:33:14.879 --> 01:33:19.279
Caption: see the screen can see the focus outline

01:33:16.799 --> 01:33:21.359
Caption: on the first link before the chart

01:33:19.279 --> 01:33:23.119
Caption: and we are expecting to be able to tab

01:33:21.359 --> 01:33:24.000
Caption: into the chart and kind of interact with

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:26.399
Caption: it so

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.719
Caption: uh if we hover over it with our mouse we

01:33:26.399 --> 01:33:31.198
Caption: can see oh fantastic there&#39;s some uh

01:33:28.719 --> 01:33:33.600
Caption: really cool kind of uh it fades out the

01:33:31.199 --> 01:33:34.880
Caption: other data and and and fades in the data

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.479
Caption: that you are looking at all the columns

01:33:34.879 --> 01:33:37.839
Caption: that you&#39;re looking at and there&#39;s

01:33:36.479 --> 01:33:39.679
Caption: little tiny tooltips that you probably

01:33:37.839 --> 01:33:40.799
Caption: can&#39;t read from back there

01:33:39.679 --> 01:33:42.639
Caption: but they are

01:33:40.799 --> 01:33:44.238
Caption: tooltips that have all the information

01:33:42.639 --> 01:33:45.840
Caption: so that if you were someone who might

01:33:44.238 --> 01:33:47.759
Caption: use screen magnification if you are

01:33:45.839 --> 01:33:49.040
Caption: zoomed right into that tool tip you have

01:33:47.759 --> 01:33:50.638
Caption: all the information that you need and

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:52.879
Caption: you don&#39;t need to kind of

01:33:50.639 --> 01:33:56.320
Caption: scroll across to the axes to to kind of

01:33:52.879 --> 01:33:58.959
Caption: guess what this uh what the what the

01:33:56.319 --> 01:34:00.638
Caption: y-axis and the x-axis categories are so

01:33:58.959 --> 01:34:03.198
Caption: everything you need is in that tooltip

01:34:00.639 --> 01:34:07.199
Caption: which is great

01:34:03.199 --> 01:34:08.960
Caption: and uh and we can uh click on the legend

01:34:07.199 --> 01:34:10.080
Caption: to toggle on and off that&#39;s a nice

01:34:08.959 --> 01:34:12.319
Caption: feature

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:14.800
Caption: um straight out of high charts uh

01:34:12.319 --> 01:34:16.399
Caption: everything you ever wanted in uh data

01:34:14.799 --> 01:34:17.439
Caption: visualization

01:34:16.399 --> 01:34:18.879
Caption: um

01:34:17.439 --> 01:34:21.520
Caption: so

01:34:18.879 --> 01:34:23.279
Caption: let&#39;s try and see so i can&#39;t use a mouse

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.799
Caption: let&#39;s say uh let&#39;s try and interact with

01:34:23.279 --> 01:34:25.839
Caption: that chart

01:34:24.799 --> 01:34:27.839
Caption: oh

01:34:25.839 --> 01:34:30.238
Caption: uh it skipped to the link straight under

01:34:27.839 --> 01:34:32.399
Caption: the chart there is no way that i can

01:34:30.238 --> 01:34:34.479
Caption: get to that chart the focus outline is

01:34:32.399 --> 01:34:37.759
Caption: going up and down up and down so how do

01:34:34.479 --> 01:34:40.399
Caption: we fix that uh so unfortunately um high

01:34:37.759 --> 01:34:42.399
Caption: charts does not uh out of the box

01:34:40.399 --> 01:34:45.759
Caption: um give you the accessibility straight

01:34:42.399 --> 01:34:46.799
Caption: away uh i really wish that it did

01:34:45.759 --> 01:34:49.759
Caption: so

01:34:46.799 --> 01:34:53.198
Caption: i will add it uh i&#39;m using a framework

01:34:49.759 --> 01:34:56.319
Caption: called reveal.js for the slides um

01:34:53.199 --> 01:34:58.800
Caption: and so i can just add that module

01:34:56.319 --> 01:35:00.479
Caption: in the code that i&#39;ve preferred earlier

01:34:58.799 --> 01:35:03.119
Caption: um

01:35:00.479 --> 01:35:04.399
Caption: so i will

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:07.439
Caption: you don&#39;t need to pay too much attention

01:35:04.399 --> 01:35:12.560
Caption: to us i will just

01:35:07.439 --> 01:35:12.560
Caption: uncomment out some javascript modules to

01:35:12.719 --> 01:35:15.920
Caption: show

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:17.679
Caption: how few steps it is so i&#39;m uncommenting

01:35:15.919 --> 01:35:19.600
Caption: out i actually only need to uncomment

01:35:17.679 --> 01:35:21.360
Caption: out one line of uh javascript modules

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:22.560
Caption: but i&#39;ve added the other two so that i

01:35:21.359 --> 01:35:24.560
Caption: can talk through them at the same time

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:28.199
Caption: as well

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:28.199
Caption: um all right

01:35:28.639 --> 01:35:32.320
Caption: so i should probably save it

01:35:34.159 --> 01:35:37.280
Caption: uh

01:35:35.199 --> 01:35:38.639
Caption: and i&#39;m back into safari i want to go

01:35:37.279 --> 01:35:40.559
Caption: into

01:35:38.639 --> 01:35:43.919
Caption: chrome

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:46.080
Caption: main chrome yes i&#39;ll do a refresh

01:35:43.919 --> 01:35:47.520
Caption: all right uh

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:49.280
Caption: you may or may not have noticed

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:51.040
Caption: something change on the screen uh if you

01:35:49.279 --> 01:35:52.799
Caption: didn&#39;t there&#39;s a little menu on the top

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:54.080
Caption: right hand corner now i&#39;ll talk about

01:35:52.799 --> 01:35:56.879
Caption: that later but let&#39;s see if it&#39;s

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:58.719
Caption: keyboard accessible oh my goodness so we

01:35:56.879 --> 01:36:01.120
Caption: are in so i&#39;ve just tabbed from the link

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:04.000
Caption: before the chart into the chart and it&#39;s

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:07.760
Caption: focused on the first column

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.759
Caption: that is the incoming

01:36:08.319 --> 01:36:15.279
Caption: the monthly income for july 2022

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:18.000
Caption: and if i press tab again it focuses on

01:36:15.279 --> 01:36:22.319
Caption: the legend which has incoming as a light

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:24.719
Caption: blue kind of color and outgoing as a

01:36:22.319 --> 01:36:27.678
Caption: very dark gray color and if i tab one

01:36:24.719 --> 01:36:30.239
Caption: more time it focuses me to the menu

01:36:27.679 --> 01:36:33.840
Caption: hamburger icon on the top

01:36:30.238 --> 01:36:35.599
Caption: and then one last time uh to the link

01:36:33.839 --> 01:36:38.638
Caption: after the chart

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:40.239
Caption: and so uh notice that um so i&#39;m just

01:36:38.639 --> 01:36:42.239
Caption: pressing tab and

01:36:40.238 --> 01:36:43.919
Caption: um it doesn&#39;t actually take me through

01:36:42.238 --> 01:36:45.118
Caption: each individual data point because if

01:36:43.919 --> 01:36:46.879
Caption: there were a lot of those that would

01:36:45.119 --> 01:36:48.080
Caption: take a person a very long time to tab

01:36:46.879 --> 01:36:50.799
Caption: all the way through

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.839
Caption: um and uh and get to kind of the rest of

01:36:50.799 --> 01:36:53.118
Caption: the article if they don&#39;t really care

01:36:51.839 --> 01:36:54.959
Caption: about the chart

01:36:53.119 --> 01:36:56.000
Caption: all the rest of the app

01:36:54.959 --> 01:36:57.279
Caption: um

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.359
Caption: so

01:36:57.279 --> 01:37:02.079
Caption: what they have added in here and

01:36:59.359 --> 01:37:02.959
Caption: um this is all quite new and not really

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:04.719
Caption: uh

01:37:02.959 --> 01:37:06.238
Caption: as several libraries have kind of done

01:37:04.719 --> 01:37:07.840
Caption: different things there&#39;s also another

01:37:06.238 --> 01:37:10.000
Caption: awesome accessible accessible chart

01:37:07.839 --> 01:37:12.879
Caption: library from visa called the visa chart

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.119
Caption: components library i think

01:37:12.879 --> 01:37:17.439
Caption: and so they have different kind of

01:37:15.119 --> 01:37:19.119
Caption: keyboard behaviors

01:37:17.439 --> 01:37:22.959
Caption: but i really really like the high charts

01:37:19.119 --> 01:37:25.679
Caption: one it&#39;s really simple and um

01:37:22.959 --> 01:37:27.119
Caption: and uh so

01:37:25.679 --> 01:37:29.920
Caption: i&#39;ve kind of used that one as a

01:37:27.119 --> 01:37:32.000
Caption: reference if i was to build my own again

01:37:29.919 --> 01:37:33.359
Caption: and when i built that one

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.040
Caption: way back when

01:37:33.359 --> 01:37:36.399
Caption: so the way to get to different data

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:38.000
Caption: series is using the

01:37:36.399 --> 01:37:39.439
Caption: data points is using the arrow key so

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.399
Caption: i&#39;ve just hit right arrow it&#39;s gone to

01:37:39.439 --> 01:37:42.399
Caption: the next

01:37:40.399 --> 01:37:44.158
Caption: column of the same data series or

01:37:42.399 --> 01:37:45.439
Caption: incoming

01:37:44.159 --> 01:37:47.520

Caption: income i don&#39;t know why what word i&#39;m

01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:50.159
Caption: looking for um

01:37:49.119 --> 01:37:52.800
Caption: and then

01:37:50.159 --> 01:37:55.199
Caption: uh hitting right right arrow again is

01:37:52.799 --> 01:37:57.118
Caption: focused on the third

01:37:55.199 --> 01:37:59.600
Caption: column um

01:37:57.119 --> 01:38:03.520
Caption: and so how do i get to the

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:05.119
Caption: next data series or the outgoings uh i

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:06.560
Caption: hit right arrow again just then and it

01:38:05.119 --> 01:38:07.760
Caption: focused on the outgoing and if i keep

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.000
Caption: hitting the right arrow and the left

01:38:07.759 --> 01:38:11.118
Caption: arrow i can go between all of those

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.119
Caption: columns

01:38:11.119 --> 01:38:14.959
Caption: but i can also switch between series by

01:38:13.119 --> 01:38:16.959
Caption: pressing up and down arrow so that&#39;s a

01:38:14.959 --> 01:38:18.479
Caption: really really nice

01:38:16.959 --> 01:38:19.679
Caption: kind of behavior that high charts has

01:38:18.479 --> 01:38:21.199
Caption: come up with

01:38:19.679 --> 01:38:22.560
Caption: i&#39;m sure talking with lots of folks in

01:38:21.199 --> 01:38:24.479
Caption: the accessibility and the disability

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:25.919
Caption: community

01:38:24.479 --> 01:38:27.199
Caption: um

01:38:25.919 --> 01:38:29.040
Caption: all right

01:38:27.199 --> 01:38:30.639
Caption: so same thing with the legend i can

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.639
Caption: change between each

01:38:30.639 --> 01:38:34.239
Caption: so i&#39;ve just tabbed the legend using

01:38:32.639 --> 01:38:37.439
Caption: left and right arrow to kind of switch

01:38:34.238 --> 01:38:40.559
Caption: between toggling them on and off

01:38:37.439 --> 01:38:43.279
Caption: and going to the button

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:44.639
Caption: i can press the space bar

01:38:43.279 --> 01:38:46.718
Caption: or press enter

01:38:44.639 --> 01:38:48.719
Caption: um i can press the space bar

01:38:46.719 --> 01:38:51.360
Caption: and i use the arrow keys to scroll

01:38:48.719 --> 01:38:53.920
Caption: through the menu but drop down uh menu

01:38:51.359 --> 01:38:56.319
Caption: accessibility is a whole nother talk

01:38:53.919 --> 01:38:58.479
Caption: but basically you can press space or

01:38:56.319 --> 01:39:01.439
Caption: enter and escape to

01:38:58.479 --> 01:39:02.479
Caption: get out of the slides not the menu

01:39:01.439 --> 01:39:03.839
Caption: so

01:39:02.479 --> 01:39:06.238
Caption: and there&#39;s a bunch of options that they

01:39:03.839 --> 01:39:08.399
Caption: added in here in here in particular

01:39:06.238 --> 01:39:10.079
Caption: being able to export the data in a

01:39:08.399 --> 01:39:12.399
Caption: format that you like so they have csv

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:14.399
Caption: they have excel they have a viewer data

01:39:12.399 --> 01:39:16.319
Caption: table which um

01:39:14.399 --> 01:39:18.158
Caption: uh will actually show a data table i

01:39:16.319 --> 01:39:20.560
Caption: can&#39;t show it in the presentation

01:39:18.159 --> 01:39:20.560
Caption: because

01:39:20.959 --> 01:39:25.839
Caption: it conflicts too much with the css of

01:39:22.959 --> 01:39:28.959
Caption: the reveal js but i do have a code pen

01:39:25.839 --> 01:39:28.959
Caption: if we get time at the end

01:39:29.119 --> 01:39:31.119
Caption: but

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.040
Caption: a lot of

01:39:31.119 --> 01:39:35.840
Caption: really awesome options so really really

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.839
Caption: fully featured

01:39:37.759 --> 01:39:41.718
Caption: data visualization library

01:39:42.959 --> 01:39:47.119
Caption: okay

01:39:44.319 --> 01:39:49.359
Caption: so the screen reader experience

01:39:47.119 --> 01:39:51.199
Caption: let&#39;s have a look at that

01:39:49.359 --> 01:39:53.439
Caption: live screen reader demos are not my

01:39:51.199 --> 01:39:54.400
Caption: forte let&#39;s see how this goes oh i gotta

01:39:53.439 --> 01:39:56.080
Caption: swap this

01:39:54.399 --> 01:39:57.600
Caption: application safari

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:59.119
Caption: safari inclusive storytelling with

01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:00.159
Caption: dynamic data window inclusive

01:39:59.119 --> 01:40:03.119
Caption: storytelling with dynamic data where

01:40:00.159 --> 01:40:04.560
Caption: content has keyboard focus is that okay

01:40:03.119 --> 01:40:05.520
Caption: yep

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:08.800
Caption: all right

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.799
Caption: uh so if i press tab

01:40:13.119 --> 01:40:18.959
Caption: okay and then i&#39;m going to press uh

01:40:16.479 --> 01:40:22.879
Caption: control option and use the arrow keys

01:40:18.959 --> 01:40:24.959
Caption: and so this is a common misconception uh

01:40:22.879 --> 01:40:26.959
Caption: is that there is such a thing called a

01:40:24.959 --> 01:40:29.359
Caption: virtual cursor for screen reader for

01:40:26.959 --> 01:40:31.919
Caption: screen readers if you um are not

01:40:29.359 --> 01:40:33.520
Caption: so familiar with screen readers so it

01:40:31.919 --> 01:40:36.639
Caption: doesn&#39;t actually

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:39.199
Caption: send any focus or hover or or anything

01:40:36.639 --> 01:40:40.560
Caption: to the chart itself so you won&#39;t see

01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:42.560
Caption: the same

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:44.719
Caption: um focus

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.639
Caption: styles happening when i navigate around

01:40:44.719 --> 01:40:48.080
Caption: using the screen reader

01:40:46.639 --> 01:40:50.159
Caption: and that is the reason why it doesn&#39;t

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:52.959
Caption: send any sort of

01:40:50.159 --> 01:40:55.520
Caption: actions to the chart and it relies

01:40:52.959 --> 01:40:58.000
Caption: solely on having the correct aria rolls

01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:59.600
Caption: or the semantic html in the back to

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.600
Caption: but you will see the

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:03.439
Caption: square blocks if you can see

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:05.439
Caption: the square box of where this virtual

01:41:03.439 --> 01:41:07.439
Caption: cursor is so you can get a bit of an

01:41:05.439 --> 01:41:09.279
Caption: idea of what&#39;s going on um and you will

01:41:07.439 --> 01:41:11.119
Caption: notice that there is a lot more to this

01:41:09.279 --> 01:41:12.319

01:41:49.679 --> 01:41:54.000

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.600

Caption: okay so uh quickly to to kind of wrap up

01:44:18.319 --> 01:44:22.319
Caption: um just speaking through kind of what&#39;s

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:24.719
Caption: under the hood of what&#39;s made this

01:44:22.319 --> 01:44:24.718
Caption: accessible

01:44:24.879 --> 01:44:28.238
Caption: and i do recommend to take the time to

01:44:26.879 --> 01:44:32.000
Caption: kind of look at what&#39;s going on if you

01:44:28.238 --> 01:44:33.599
Caption: do try out high charts inspect the dom

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.359
Caption: turn on the accessibility tree it&#39;s in

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.800
Caption: your developer tools you can google how

01:44:35.359 --> 01:44:38.158
Caption: to turn on the accessibility tree in

01:44:36.799 --> 01:44:39.359
Caption: either chrome or

01:44:38.159 --> 01:44:41.439
Caption: uh

01:44:39.359 --> 01:44:42.718
Caption: or firefox or whatever whatever browser

01:44:41.439 --> 01:44:46.639
Caption: you use um if you understand the

01:44:42.719 --> 01:44:50.080
Caption: accessibility tree um super helpful um

01:44:46.639 --> 01:44:52.560
Caption: but uh in in kind of the the

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:55.119
Caption: step by step firstly using javascript to

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:56.399
Caption: add um mouse and keyboard interactivity

01:44:55.119 --> 01:44:58.800
Caption: uh it is something that you have to

01:44:56.399 --> 01:45:00.000
Caption: deliberately do extra um not for high

01:44:58.799 --> 01:45:01.599
Caption: charts it&#39;s what&#39;s being done in high

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.080
Caption: charts um but if you were doing it

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:07.199
Caption: yourself and adding aria to the parts of

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:08.639
Caption: the svg to give it meaning so

01:45:07.199 --> 01:45:10.719
Caption: for example and

01:45:08.639 --> 01:45:13.520
Caption: we might have missed that with the demo

01:45:10.719 --> 01:45:14.880
Caption: just now uh hijaz has actually marked up

01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:16.479
Caption: the columns

01:45:14.879 --> 01:45:18.158
Caption: as images

01:45:16.479 --> 01:45:20.319
Caption: and then added an aria label to those

01:45:18.159 --> 01:45:21.840
Caption: images

01:45:20.319 --> 01:45:24.879
Caption: as it kind of represents what it is it

01:45:21.839 --> 01:45:26.560
Caption: is an image on a screen

01:45:24.879 --> 01:45:28.238
Caption: and then adding that non-visual content

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:30.000
Caption: to describe the chart for the screen

01:45:28.238 --> 01:45:33.359
Caption: reader user

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.359
Caption: and it&#39;s also great for seo

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.719
Caption: and

01:45:34.479 --> 01:45:37.839
Caption: and last but not least back to the start

01:45:36.719 --> 01:45:39.600
Caption: of the talk when we&#39;re talking about

01:45:37.839 --> 01:45:41.359
Caption: just working on accessibility for an

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:44.239
Caption: image of a chart don&#39;t forget about the

01:45:41.359 --> 01:45:46.080
Caption: content and visual accessibility as well

01:45:44.238 --> 01:45:47.039
Caption: um so that applies for both interactive

01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:48.959
Caption: charts

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:51.520
Caption: um keyboard navigation is tabbing to the

01:45:48.959 --> 01:45:52.959
Caption: main bits um so don&#39;t make them tab

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.639
Caption: through absolutely every data point

01:45:52.959 --> 01:45:56.718
Caption: arrow keys between the data points or

01:45:54.639 --> 01:45:58.479
Caption: space or enter for buttons

01:45:56.719 --> 01:46:01.520
Caption: and for a screen reader front load the

01:45:58.479 --> 01:46:03.439
Caption: info give them um

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.959
Caption: give screen reader users uh kind of as

01:46:03.439 --> 01:46:05.919
Caption: much info as possible that they can pick

01:46:04.959 --> 01:46:07.198
Caption: through

01:46:05.919 --> 01:46:08.799
Caption: and but also make sure you give them the

01:46:07.199 --> 01:46:10.880
Caption: choice to kind of skip all of that so

01:46:08.799 --> 01:46:13.040
Caption: make sure you have your headings

01:46:10.879 --> 01:46:13.040
Caption: on

01:46:13.839 --> 01:46:18.959
Caption: or even a skip chart button is something

01:46:16.479 --> 01:46:21.520
Caption: that we&#39;ve used before as well

01:46:18.959 --> 01:46:23.759
Caption: and don&#39;t get too creative with arya

01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:26.479
Caption: the first rule of aria is don&#39;t use arya

01:46:23.759 --> 01:46:29.359
Caption: a few accessibility folks

01:46:26.479 --> 01:46:31.919
Caption: familiar with that um please

01:46:29.359 --> 01:46:34.000
Caption: use the high charts or other frameworks

01:46:31.919 --> 01:46:35.839
Caption: that have tested with real folks as a

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.600
Caption: reference

01:46:35.839 --> 01:46:40.959
Caption: and if you do roll your own and i&#39;ve

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:43.520
Caption: spelt roll wrong on the screen uh

01:46:40.959 --> 01:46:45.198
Caption: please make sure you engage usability

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:48.399
Caption: testing with screen reader users and and

01:46:45.199 --> 01:46:50.880
Caption: other assistive technology users

01:46:48.399 --> 01:46:52.479
Caption: all right a note on color

01:46:50.879 --> 01:46:55.919
Caption: this is a big one and i&#39;ve

01:46:52.479 --> 01:46:57.919
Caption: left it to kind of a little tiny gap

01:46:55.919 --> 01:47:00.000
Caption: don&#39;t use color alone to differentiate

01:46:57.919 --> 01:47:01.040
Caption: data or differentiate different data

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.159
Caption: series

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:05.359
Caption: so there&#39;s

01:47:02.159 --> 01:47:07.439
Caption: lots of talks about using patterns

01:47:05.359 --> 01:47:09.279
Caption: you can use different shape markers and

01:47:07.439 --> 01:47:10.238
Caption: different patterns and stuff like that

01:47:09.279 --> 01:47:11.678
Caption: but

01:47:10.238 --> 01:47:13.039
Caption: high trust has also done research on

01:47:11.679 --> 01:47:16.239
Caption: this and they say to use monochrome

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:17.760
Caption: palettes if possible and so this helps

01:47:16.238 --> 01:47:20.238
Caption: everyone not just kind of red cream

01:47:17.759 --> 01:47:22.718
Caption: color blind folks

01:47:20.238 --> 01:47:25.118
Caption: and it&#39;s also got cool kind of

01:47:22.719 --> 01:47:26.560
Caption: side effects like you can print tactile

01:47:25.119 --> 01:47:28.239
Caption: charts if you make sure that you use a

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.919
Caption: monochrome palette

01:47:28.238 --> 01:47:31.678
Caption: um

01:47:29.919 --> 01:47:34.479
Caption: and also be careful with patterns they

01:47:31.679 --> 01:47:36.880
Caption: can make it worse so

01:47:34.479 --> 01:47:39.040
Caption: and um i i haven&#39;t noticed that myself

01:47:36.879 --> 01:47:41.118
Caption: so don&#39;t just go stick a pattern on it

01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:43.679
Caption: done um have a little take a little bit

01:47:41.119 --> 01:47:45.439
Caption: time to think about it

01:47:43.679 --> 01:47:47.600
Caption: all right and i have a whole bunch of

01:47:45.439 --> 01:47:50.319
Caption: resources on there um

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:53.280
Caption: chartability i highly recommend it is

01:47:50.319 --> 01:47:55.279
Caption: like a cag for charts or or a checklist

01:47:53.279 --> 01:47:57.439
Caption: of tests that is really deep and really

01:47:55.279 --> 01:47:59.839
Caption: really useful for charts

01:47:57.439 --> 01:48:01.520
Caption: and accessibility of database but i will

01:47:59.839 --> 01:48:03.439

01:53:25.439 --> 01:53:28.159

01:53:26.799 --> 01:53:30.079

01:53:28.159 --> 01:53:33.400

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:14.600
Caption: about distributed databases why what and

01:57:11.759 --> 01:57:20.559
Caption: how so please make him welcome

01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:23.040
Caption: [Applause]

01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:24.639
Caption: thanks hi i&#39;m todd

01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:26.639
Caption: i&#39;m a principal software engineer at

01:57:24.639 --> 01:57:28.800
Caption: family zone which is a local perth-based

01:57:26.639 --> 01:57:30.320
Caption: company in the field of cyber safety for

01:57:28.799 --> 01:57:32.000
Caption: children

01:57:30.319 --> 01:57:34.479
Caption: and so first i&#39;d like to thank the

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:38.719
Caption: sponsors of dg perth 2022 i&#39;m grateful

01:57:34.479 --> 01:57:39.679
Caption: to be up here to speak to you today

01:57:38.719 --> 01:57:41.760
Caption: i&#39;m going to be talking about

01:57:39.679 --> 01:57:43.599
Caption: distributed databases

01:57:41.759 --> 01:57:45.678
Caption: and first a distributed database refers

01:57:43.599 --> 01:57:47.439
Caption: to a database that just uses more than

01:57:45.679 --> 01:57:48.560
Caption: one network computer or a cluster of

01:57:47.439 --> 01:57:50.159
Caption: computers

01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:51.839
Caption: this allows them to scale up to handle

01:57:50.159 --> 01:57:53.199
Caption: more work and more data than a single

01:57:51.839 --> 01:57:55.598
Caption: computer can do

01:57:53.199 --> 01:57:57.280
Caption: but why why talk about this well

01:57:55.599 --> 01:57:58.959
Caption: the amount of data that&#39;s been collected

01:57:57.279 --> 01:58:01.118
Caption: and managed has grown immensely over the

01:57:58.959 --> 01:58:03.359
Caption: past couple of decades the rise of the

01:58:01.119 --> 01:58:04.959
Caption: internet and the proliferation of

01:58:03.359 --> 01:58:07.279
Caption: devices in that time has driven the

01:58:04.959 --> 01:58:08.959
Caption: development of more advanced software to

01:58:07.279 --> 01:58:10.559
Caption: handle that data

01:58:08.959 --> 01:58:12.000
Caption: but as tech professionals we don&#39;t often

01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:13.919
Caption: need to actually use this kind of

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.359
Caption: database system and the majority of

01:58:13.919 --> 01:58:17.919
Caption: software just works well with a

01:58:15.359 --> 01:58:19.759
Caption: traditional relational database

01:58:17.919 --> 01:58:22.718
Caption: but if we do use a distributed database

01:58:19.759 --> 01:58:25.039
Caption: we may not truly understand how it works

01:58:22.719 --> 01:58:27.599
Caption: or what its strengths and weaknesses are

01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:29.599
Caption: and how to use it most effectively

01:58:27.599 --> 01:58:31.439
Caption: so distributed databases however are a

01:58:29.599 --> 01:58:34.239
Caption: vast and complex subject and my short

01:58:31.439 --> 01:58:35.198
Caption: talk can only barely skim the surface my

01:58:34.238 --> 01:58:36.718
Caption: aim is to give you a little

01:58:35.199 --> 01:58:39.199
Caption: understanding of some of the concepts

01:58:36.719 --> 01:58:42.560
Caption: which may help evaluate a distributed

01:58:39.199 --> 01:58:42.560
Caption: database for solving your problem

01:58:42.719 --> 01:58:46.159
Caption: relational databases have been around

01:58:44.319 --> 01:58:47.759
Caption: since the mid-1970s

01:58:46.159 --> 01:58:49.599
Caption: and this model has proven incredibly

01:58:47.759 --> 01:58:51.598
Caption: flexible and useful for solving any

01:58:49.599 --> 01:58:53.439
Caption: number of problems and in my opinion

01:58:51.599 --> 01:58:56.080
Caption: this tech has been a cornerstone of why

01:58:53.439 --> 01:58:57.919
Caption: software now runs much of the world

01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:59.679
Caption: a crucial feature of these databases

01:58:57.919 --> 01:59:01.439
Caption: isn&#39;t apparent in the name and that&#39;s

01:58:59.679 --> 01:59:03.199
Caption: acid transactions

01:59:01.439 --> 01:59:05.198
Caption: i won&#39;t go through the full definitions

01:59:03.199 --> 01:59:06.880
Caption: right now but to paraphrase these

01:59:05.199 --> 01:59:09.280
Caption: properties provide guarantees on the

01:59:06.879 --> 01:59:11.040
Caption: correctness and reliability of your data

01:59:09.279 --> 01:59:13.439
Caption: and they prevent transactions from

01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:15.760
Caption: interfering with each other

01:59:13.439 --> 01:59:18.080
Caption: structured query language or sql was

01:59:15.759 --> 01:59:20.399
Caption: also invented at the end of the 1970s to

01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:23.119
Caption: make good use of relational databases

01:59:20.399 --> 01:59:25.279
Caption: and still very popular today

01:59:23.119 --> 01:59:29.959
Caption: so these dbs dominated the landscape for

01:59:25.279 --> 01:59:29.959
Caption: 40 years and are still prevalent today

01:59:31.119 --> 01:59:34.560
Caption: however towards the turn of the century

01:59:33.279 --> 01:59:37.039
Caption: people started to find that they were

01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:38.479
Caption: needing more and more powerful systems

01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:39.919
Caption: they were reading sorry they were

01:59:38.479 --> 01:59:41.439
Caption: reaching the limit of how much computing

01:59:39.919 --> 01:59:42.718
Caption: power they could throw at any particular

01:59:41.439 --> 01:59:44.479
Caption: data set

01:59:42.719 --> 01:59:46.320
Caption: but data was still being produced at an

01:59:44.479 --> 01:59:48.159
Caption: increasing rate

01:59:46.319 --> 01:59:50.000
Caption: so some vendors did produce large

01:59:48.159 --> 01:59:52.479
Caption: specialized computers like mainframes

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.319
Caption: but they&#39;re extremely expensive and they

01:59:52.479 --> 01:59:56.000
Caption: require that big upfront investment for

01:59:54.319 --> 01:59:57.279
Caption: your peak capacity

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.799
Caption: but some of the big companies that we

01:59:57.279 --> 02:00:00.959
Caption: know today like google and amazon were

01:59:58.799 --> 02:00:03.118
Caption: just just starting to experience their

02:00:00.959 --> 02:00:05.279
Caption: rise so they needed to find ways to

02:00:03.119 --> 02:00:07.119
Caption: scale up in a big way to cope with their

02:00:05.279 --> 02:00:08.479
Caption: new demand

02:00:07.119 --> 02:00:10.399
Caption: they didn&#39;t want to use expensive

02:00:08.479 --> 02:00:12.238
Caption: specialized hardware if they were going

02:00:10.399 --> 02:00:13.599
Caption: to scale they would need to do it with

02:00:12.238 --> 02:00:14.799
Caption: the commodity hardware that was readily

02:00:13.599 --> 02:00:16.560
Caption: available

02:00:14.799 --> 02:00:18.158
Caption: so as the saying goes necessity is the

02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:19.760
Caption: mother of invention

02:00:18.159 --> 02:00:21.920
Caption: and the needs of these first internet

02:00:19.759 --> 02:00:24.000
Caption: scale companies led to innovation in

02:00:21.919 --> 02:00:25.520
Caption: this area and new systems were built

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.839
Caption: that could share the load across many

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:27.839
Caption: computers

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.319
Caption: so a wave of new databases appeared to

02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:35.199
Caption: help solve the problem

02:00:32.319 --> 02:00:36.959
Caption: in 2006 and 2007 google published the

02:00:35.199 --> 02:00:38.400
Caption: big table paper and amazon published the

02:00:36.959 --> 02:00:40.159
Caption: dynamo paper

02:00:38.399 --> 02:00:42.238
Caption: and these seminal papers seeded the

02:00:40.159 --> 02:00:43.599
Caption: generation of new systems that were

02:00:42.238 --> 02:00:44.879
Caption: inspired by them

02:00:43.599 --> 02:00:46.800
Caption: and they were pushing the boundaries of

02:00:44.879 --> 02:00:49.439
Caption: what was possible at the time

02:00:46.799 --> 02:00:50.959
Caption: most importantly they were very scalable

02:00:49.439 --> 02:00:52.718
Caption: they all had some things in common they

02:00:50.959 --> 02:00:54.399
Caption: didn&#39;t use sql for reading and writing

02:00:52.719 --> 02:00:55.679
Caption: data and they didn&#39;t use the relational

02:00:54.399 --> 02:00:57.040
Caption: model at all

02:00:55.679 --> 02:00:58.560
Caption: there were lots of different approaches

02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:00.080
Caption: to modeling the data

02:00:58.560 --> 02:01:01.679
Caption: each originally targeted at solving a

02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:04.879
Caption: specific problem

02:01:01.679 --> 02:01:07.679
Caption: so for example key value databases graph

02:01:04.879 --> 02:01:09.759
Caption: wide column and document etc

02:01:07.679 --> 02:01:11.199
Caption: the era of the purpose-built data store

02:01:09.759 --> 02:01:13.118
Caption: had begun

02:01:11.199 --> 02:01:15.920
Caption: choose to suit your specific need rather

02:01:13.119 --> 02:01:17.760
Caption: than a one-size-fits-all approach

02:01:15.919 --> 02:01:20.080
Caption: the data modeling is denormalized and

02:01:17.759 --> 02:01:22.319
Caption: flexible some were optimized for very

02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:24.639
Caption: right-heavy workloads some are optimized

02:01:22.319 --> 02:01:26.238
Caption: for read heavy workloads

02:01:24.639 --> 02:01:29.520
Caption: and this shift away from the relational

02:01:26.238 --> 02:01:31.359
Caption: model and from sql led to the term nosql

02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:35.359
Caption: being coined to emphasize that they&#39;re

02:01:31.359 --> 02:01:37.598
Caption: not in sql or not only sql systems

02:01:35.359 --> 02:01:40.638
Caption: but they had real limitations as well

02:01:37.599 --> 02:01:42.320
Caption: they didn&#39;t support asset transactions

02:01:40.639 --> 02:01:44.239
Caption: generally and they did not replace

02:01:42.319 --> 02:01:47.439
Caption: relational databases and some of the

02:01:44.238 --> 02:01:49.039
Caption: reasons for that why i&#39;ll cover

02:01:47.439 --> 02:01:52.159
Caption: computer scientists were a little ahead

02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:53.839
Caption: of this need so in 1999 eric bureau

02:01:52.159 --> 02:01:55.599
Caption: published the cap principle which became

02:01:53.839 --> 02:01:57.118
Caption: the cap theorem and i mentioned it

02:01:55.599 --> 02:01:58.719
Caption: because the cap theorem has heavily

02:01:57.119 --> 02:02:00.399
Caption: influenced the design

02:01:58.719 --> 02:02:02.239
Caption: of many distributed data stores since

02:02:00.399 --> 02:02:04.000
Caption: that time

02:02:02.238 --> 02:02:05.759
Caption: it says that any distributed data store

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Caption: can only provide two of the following

02:02:05.759 --> 02:02:11.359
Caption: three guarantees consistency

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:13.759
Caption: availability and partition tolerance

02:02:11.359 --> 02:02:15.919
Caption: now consistency we&#39;re familiar with from

02:02:13.759 --> 02:02:17.919
Caption: asset transactions

02:02:15.919 --> 02:02:19.919
Caption: partition tolerance and availability are

02:02:17.919 --> 02:02:24.158
Caption: concepts that only exist in distributed

02:02:19.919 --> 02:02:24.158
Caption: systems with multiple separate computers

02:02:24.238 --> 02:02:29.359
Caption: a cp system is one that gives up

02:02:26.639 --> 02:02:30.959
Caption: availability to guarantee consistency if

02:02:29.359 --> 02:02:34.158
Caption: you write value a

02:02:30.959 --> 02:02:35.839
Caption: all subsequent reads will read value a

02:02:34.159 --> 02:02:37.280
Caption: if there&#39;s network problem

02:02:35.839 --> 02:02:39.439
Caption: it may prevent you from writing or

02:02:37.279 --> 02:02:40.879
Caption: writing data that if it might cause

02:02:39.439 --> 02:02:42.799
Caption: problems later

02:02:40.879 --> 02:02:45.520
Caption: an ap system is one that gives up

02:02:42.799 --> 02:02:47.520
Caption: consistency to be available you&#39;ll

02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:48.879
Caption: always get an answer even if the data

02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:50.639
Caption: could be stale

02:02:48.879 --> 02:02:52.399
Caption: and if there&#39;s a network problem it&#39;ll

02:02:50.639 --> 02:02:54.639
Caption: accept your rights and reads even if

02:02:52.399 --> 02:02:55.919
Caption: there&#39;s a chance for it to be lost later

02:02:54.639 --> 02:02:57.360
Caption: or even

02:02:55.919 --> 02:02:59.198
Caption: stale

02:02:57.359 --> 02:03:01.279
Caption: theoretically a ca system would give up

02:02:59.199 --> 02:03:03.199
Caption: neither but it&#39;s generally considered

02:03:01.279 --> 02:03:05.039
Caption: infeasible

02:03:03.199 --> 02:03:06.639
Caption: this way of thinking became the de facto

02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:08.319
Caption: way to categorize these distributed

02:03:06.639 --> 02:03:10.560
Caption: databases because it answers the

02:03:08.319 --> 02:03:12.799
Caption: important question if something starts

02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:15.040
Caption: to fail can i rely on the database to

02:03:12.799 --> 02:03:17.118
Caption: say consistent no matter what

02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:20.479
Caption: or can i rely on the database to stay

02:03:17.119 --> 02:03:20.479
Caption: available as much as it can

02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:24.959
Caption: before distributed databases people are

02:03:23.439 --> 02:03:26.560
Caption: already dealing with scale problems with

02:03:24.959 --> 02:03:28.959
Caption: the concept of partitioning which you

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:30.560
Caption: may have heard of partitioning is the

02:03:28.959 --> 02:03:32.718
Caption: name for just splitting up a data set

02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:34.719
Caption: into smaller subsets or pieces

02:03:32.719 --> 02:03:37.520
Caption: and this is for improved performance or

02:03:34.719 --> 02:03:39.119
Caption: easier management of the data

02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:40.639
Caption: for petitioning to work there needs to

02:03:39.119 --> 02:03:42.479
Caption: be a way of deciding where a particular

02:03:40.639 --> 02:03:44.080
Caption: piece of data belongs and this is

02:03:42.479 --> 02:03:45.359
Caption: usually done by taking a key from your

02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:47.280
Caption: data

02:03:45.359 --> 02:03:48.718
Caption: and this is called the partition key and

02:03:47.279 --> 02:03:50.799
Caption: the choice of partition key can be

02:03:48.719 --> 02:03:53.599
Caption: crucial in determining the performance

02:03:50.799 --> 02:03:53.598
Caption: of your workload

02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:57.439
Caption: partitioning using a time field is a

02:03:55.679 --> 02:03:59.520
Caption: good choice for data sets to continually

02:03:57.439 --> 02:04:01.198
Caption: grow over time

02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:02.879
Caption: by petitioning for the range of time

02:04:01.199 --> 02:04:05.360
Caption: means that one partition can&#39;t grow

02:04:02.879 --> 02:04:07.359
Caption: forever and if you need to prune off the

02:04:05.359 --> 02:04:09.598
Caption: oldest times you can just drop the

02:04:07.359 --> 02:04:12.479
Caption: oldest partitions

02:04:09.599 --> 02:04:14.879
Caption: but for petitioning a regular string key

02:04:12.479 --> 02:04:16.799
Caption: and imagine in this example that your

02:04:14.879 --> 02:04:18.799
Caption: keys only start with the 26 letters of

02:04:16.799 --> 02:04:20.638
Caption: the english alphabet if you wanted to

02:04:18.799 --> 02:04:23.118
Caption: split this into three partitions you

02:04:20.639 --> 02:04:24.400
Caption: could just simply take a to g for

02:04:23.119 --> 02:04:26.560
Caption: partition one

02:04:24.399 --> 02:04:29.279
Caption: h to p for partition two and q to z for

02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:29.280
Caption: partition three

02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:34.320
Caption: hash partitioning is another common type

02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:36.320
Caption: where a hash function&#39;s used applied to

02:04:34.319 --> 02:04:38.399
Caption: the key and the result is used to work

02:04:36.319 --> 02:04:40.238
Caption: out what partition to use

02:04:38.399 --> 02:04:41.919
Caption: this is similar to how hash table works

02:04:40.238 --> 02:04:43.519
Caption: which you&#39;ve probably come across but

02:04:41.919 --> 02:04:45.599
Caption: good hash functions are excellent at

02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:47.679
Caption: spreading your keys across out across

02:04:45.599 --> 02:04:49.599
Caption: any range even if you have keys that are

02:04:47.679 --> 02:04:52.320
Caption: very similar which might not have worked

02:04:49.599 --> 02:04:54.239
Caption: in the alphabetical example for a

02:04:52.319 --> 02:04:56.319
Caption: distributed database to spread the load

02:04:54.238 --> 02:04:58.319
Caption: across multiple computers clearly you

02:04:56.319 --> 02:05:00.238
Caption: need to spread the data across these

02:04:58.319 --> 02:05:02.799
Caption: computers or nodes as well

02:05:00.238 --> 02:05:04.399
Caption: if each node had a full copy of the data

02:05:02.799 --> 02:05:06.638
Caption: it would limit the size of your database

02:05:04.399 --> 02:05:08.319
Caption: somewhat defeating the purpose so what

02:05:06.639 --> 02:05:10.479
Caption: makes sense is to divide the divider

02:05:08.319 --> 02:05:12.238
Caption: sorry is to divide the data up

02:05:10.479 --> 02:05:13.439
Caption: and share it across those multiple

02:05:12.238 --> 02:05:15.678
Caption: computers

02:05:13.439 --> 02:05:17.198
Caption: this sounds like partitioning well it is

02:05:15.679 --> 02:05:18.639
Caption: there&#39;s also another name for this

02:05:17.199 --> 02:05:20.239
Caption: sharding

02:05:18.639 --> 02:05:22.080
Caption: they&#39;re often used interchangeably but

02:05:20.238 --> 02:05:24.000
Caption: strictly sharding is partitioning data

02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:26.800
Caption: across multiple computers or multiple

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.479
Caption: database instances

02:05:26.799 --> 02:05:30.479
Caption: a common sharding technique is known as

02:05:28.479 --> 02:05:32.560
Caption: consistent hashing

02:05:30.479 --> 02:05:34.399
Caption: and this type of hash partitioning

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:35.520
Caption: is designed to avoid an awkward scaling

02:05:34.399 --> 02:05:37.439
Caption: problem

02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:39.439
Caption: if you take this simple approach with

02:05:37.439 --> 02:05:41.439
Caption: the formula on screen

02:05:39.439 --> 02:05:42.879
Caption: if we want to add a new node or remove a

02:05:41.439 --> 02:05:45.119
Caption: node

02:05:42.879 --> 02:05:48.158
Caption: the shard count in this formula changes

02:05:45.119 --> 02:05:49.840
Caption: and what that means though is that most

02:05:48.159 --> 02:05:51.520
Caption: of the keys now go to a different chart

02:05:49.839 --> 02:05:53.040
Caption: number it means your data needs to be

02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:55.040
Caption: moved from many nodes to many other

02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:57.280
Caption: nodes essentially you can&#39;t scale up or

02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:59.599
Caption: down

02:05:57.279 --> 02:06:01.598
Caption: way back in 1997 akamai technologies

02:05:59.599 --> 02:06:03.520
Caption: invented consistent hashing

02:06:01.599 --> 02:06:06.080
Caption: so what it does differently is that it

02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:07.919
Caption: instead assigns each node an equal range

02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:09.520
Caption: of that hash space and this is

02:06:07.919 --> 02:06:11.599
Caption: visualized as being distributed around

02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:13.919
Caption: the outside of a ring which is where the

02:06:11.599 --> 02:06:15.919
Caption: term hash ring comes from

02:06:13.919 --> 02:06:17.839
Caption: you can imagine that each node is inside

02:06:15.919 --> 02:06:19.759
Caption: an equal piece of the pi

02:06:17.839 --> 02:06:22.080
Caption: and the output of the hash function is

02:06:19.759 --> 02:06:24.158
Caption: mapped onto the ring and this maps it to

02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:25.760
Caption: a node

02:06:24.159 --> 02:06:27.439
Caption: the major advantage that this approach

02:06:25.759 --> 02:06:30.000
Caption: has is that if a node is added or

02:06:27.439 --> 02:06:31.520
Caption: removed then far less the data needs to

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:34.159
Caption: be moved between the nodes just the

02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:35.839
Caption: overlapping sections of your ring

02:06:34.159 --> 02:06:37.439
Caption: and this overhead is relatively low and

02:06:35.839 --> 02:06:39.198
Caption: manageable

02:06:37.439 --> 02:06:41.040
Caption: the process of moving this data around

02:06:39.199 --> 02:06:42.560
Caption: is usually called rebalancing and this

02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:44.560
Caption: is an important thing for a database to

02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:46.959
Caption: do if it wants to allow scaling up or

02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:49.280
Caption: down without rebuilding the database and

02:06:46.959 --> 02:06:50.799
Caption: while data is being moved the db might

02:06:49.279 --> 02:06:54.078
Caption: need to reroute requests internally

02:06:50.799 --> 02:06:55.598
Caption: until the rebalance is complete

02:06:54.079 --> 02:06:57.599
Caption: in a distributed data system there&#39;s

02:06:55.599 --> 02:06:59.679
Caption: often several copies of the data on

02:06:57.599 --> 02:07:01.280
Caption: multiple nodes as well to guard against

02:06:59.679 --> 02:07:03.520
Caption: losing one of them

02:07:01.279 --> 02:07:05.598
Caption: this gives the benefit of redundancy but

02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:08.799
Caption: plus higher availability should one of

02:07:05.599 --> 02:07:10.560
Caption: the copies become unavailable

02:07:08.799 --> 02:07:13.359
Caption: because this this also reduces the need

02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:15.760
Caption: for ultra expensive reliable hardware

02:07:13.359 --> 02:07:18.000
Caption: because failures do happen anyway so if

02:07:15.759 --> 02:07:21.598
Caption: they&#39;re embraced and handled this is a

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.599
Caption: win for reliability and cost

02:07:22.319 --> 02:07:26.479
Caption: okay we&#39;ve talked a bit about how data

02:07:23.919 --> 02:07:27.839
Caption: is logically distributed but how do the

02:07:26.479 --> 02:07:29.199
Caption: nodes actually know what&#39;s going on

02:07:27.839 --> 02:07:31.439
Caption: elsewhere in the cluster and what what

02:07:29.199 --> 02:07:32.800
Caption: makes them a team

02:07:31.439 --> 02:07:35.279
Caption: they might need to know where a piece of

02:07:32.799 --> 02:07:37.118
Caption: data belongs who&#39;s responsible for it

02:07:35.279 --> 02:07:39.439
Caption: who else has a copy

02:07:37.119 --> 02:07:40.320
Caption: are the other nodes healthy failing shut

02:07:39.439 --> 02:07:42.159
Caption: down

02:07:40.319 --> 02:07:43.678
Caption: there&#39;s been a node added or removed how

02:07:42.159 --> 02:07:45.360
Caption: does it learn of all this

02:07:43.679 --> 02:07:47.280
Caption: this needs to be shared and this can&#39;t

02:07:45.359 --> 02:07:48.799
Caption: always be configured upfront and never

02:07:47.279 --> 02:07:49.919
Caption: change

02:07:48.799 --> 02:07:53.198
Caption: so i&#39;m going to talk about two

02:07:49.919 --> 02:07:53.198
Caption: techniques that are used for this

02:07:53.759 --> 02:07:57.598
Caption: if you can tolerate a slight delay

02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:59.199
Caption: before all of your nodes are in sync say

02:07:57.599 --> 02:08:00.560
Caption: less than 10 seconds

02:07:59.199 --> 02:08:02.400
Caption: then a common approach is to use a

02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:04.239
Caption: gossip protocol

02:08:02.399 --> 02:08:06.079
Caption: a gossip protocol is sometimes also

02:08:04.238 --> 02:08:07.198
Caption: called an epidemic protocol

02:08:06.079 --> 02:08:09.599
Caption: because it&#39;s similar to the way the

02:08:07.199 --> 02:08:11.119
Caption: epidemic&#39;s spread

02:08:09.599 --> 02:08:13.199
Caption: when a node receives a new piece of

02:08:11.119 --> 02:08:15.119
Caption: gossip it randomly picks one or more

02:08:13.199 --> 02:08:17.040
Caption: other nodes to pass it onto

02:08:15.119 --> 02:08:18.959
Caption: and this piece of gossip spreads until

02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:20.879
Caption: all of the nodes have it

02:08:18.959 --> 02:08:24.238
Caption: this can happen surprisingly quickly and

02:08:20.879 --> 02:08:26.399
Caption: large clusters can converge in seconds

02:08:24.238 --> 02:08:28.319
Caption: why bother with this trouble though

02:08:26.399 --> 02:08:30.879
Caption: can we just tell all of the other nodes

02:08:28.319 --> 02:08:32.399
Caption: directly or maybe our network supports a

02:08:30.879 --> 02:08:34.238
Caption: broadcast

02:08:32.399 --> 02:08:36.560
Caption: the problem with that is that it doesn&#39;t

02:08:34.238 --> 02:08:38.638
Caption: scale very well as the number of nodes

02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:40.800
Caption: increases the amount of network traffic

02:08:38.639 --> 02:08:42.320
Caption: goes up exponentially until the system

02:08:40.799 --> 02:08:44.158
Caption: collapses

02:08:42.319 --> 02:08:46.000
Caption: so gossip protocol instead keeps the

02:08:44.159 --> 02:08:48.159
Caption: overhead on the network and each node to

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.079
Caption: a pretty constant level even for very

02:08:48.159 --> 02:08:52.639
Caption: large clusters you just sacrifice a

02:08:50.079 --> 02:08:54.239
Caption: little time

02:08:52.639 --> 02:08:56.560
Caption: but you might also think why can&#39;t they

02:08:54.238 --> 02:08:58.959
Caption: just be a coordinator or a leader and

02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:01.040
Caption: the nodes stay in sync with this leader

02:08:58.959 --> 02:09:03.198
Caption: absolutely that works very well for

02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:04.719
Caption: mostly smaller clusters and there are

02:09:03.199 --> 02:09:07.360
Caption: plenty of distributed databases out

02:09:04.719 --> 02:09:09.119
Caption: there that operate with this model

02:09:07.359 --> 02:09:10.638
Caption: but we&#39;ve introduced a weakness what

02:09:09.119 --> 02:09:11.919
Caption: happens when the leader becomes

02:09:10.639 --> 02:09:13.439
Caption: unavailable

02:09:11.919 --> 02:09:16.399
Caption: the system can&#39;t share any new

02:09:13.439 --> 02:09:17.599
Caption: information until that&#39;s resolved

02:09:16.399 --> 02:09:19.439
Caption: okay let&#39;s make the coordinators

02:09:17.599 --> 02:09:20.320
Caption: redundant have three of them

02:09:19.439 --> 02:09:22.159
Caption: but

02:09:20.319 --> 02:09:24.238
Caption: how do they stay in perfect sync and how

02:09:22.159 --> 02:09:25.679
Caption: do they decide on a leader so we&#39;ve come

02:09:24.238 --> 02:09:28.319
Caption: up against the problem of distributed

02:09:25.679 --> 02:09:28.320
Caption: consensus

02:09:29.119 --> 02:09:33.280
Caption: so one way to decide on something is to

02:09:30.719 --> 02:09:35.360
Caption: have a simple vote a simple majority is

02:09:33.279 --> 02:09:37.359
Caption: enough to decide on the outcome but

02:09:35.359 --> 02:09:40.158
Caption: computers and networks can fail at any

02:09:37.359 --> 02:09:41.919
Caption: moment and this can skew the voting

02:09:40.159 --> 02:09:45.199
Caption: it&#39;s a pretty fundamental need to be

02:09:41.919 --> 02:09:47.359
Caption: sure of what has happened in your system

02:09:45.199 --> 02:09:49.679
Caption: in 1990 leslie lampert first wrote a

02:09:47.359 --> 02:09:51.598
Caption: paper describing the paxos algorithm

02:09:49.679 --> 02:09:52.959
Caption: which is the seminal work on distributed

02:09:51.599 --> 02:09:54.639
Caption: consensus

02:09:52.959 --> 02:09:56.718
Caption: but it turned out to be hard to

02:09:54.639 --> 02:09:59.119
Caption: implement and hard to understand and

02:09:56.719 --> 02:10:01.760
Caption: left a lot to be solved by developers so

02:09:59.119 --> 02:10:03.040
Caption: much later in 2013 the raft algorithm

02:10:01.759 --> 02:10:05.279
Caption: was published

02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:07.439
Caption: it&#39;s based on paxos but but easier to

02:10:05.279 --> 02:10:10.638
Caption: understand and to to work with and so

02:10:07.439 --> 02:10:10.639
Caption: it&#39;s been popular since then

02:10:11.599 --> 02:10:16.879
Caption: so consistency in a distributed system

02:10:14.238 --> 02:10:18.799
Caption: needs global agreement on changes

02:10:16.879 --> 02:10:20.638
Caption: but how does it work if instead we chose

02:10:18.799 --> 02:10:22.238
Caption: to give up strong consistency to be

02:10:20.639 --> 02:10:25.119
Caption: available

02:10:22.238 --> 02:10:27.039
Caption: we can&#39;t just let changes be lost can we

02:10:25.119 --> 02:10:30.159
Caption: so instead practical systems are instead

02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:31.520
Caption: what&#39;s called eventually consistent

02:10:30.159 --> 02:10:33.360
Caption: this means that the different nodes in

02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:35.839
Caption: this system asynchronously replicate

02:10:33.359 --> 02:10:37.919
Caption: data to each other and then converge on

02:10:35.839 --> 02:10:38.959
Caption: one just just one value for any piece of

02:10:37.919 --> 02:10:41.119
Caption: data

02:10:38.959 --> 02:10:43.759
Caption: in the meantime it&#39;s sometimes possible

02:10:41.119 --> 02:10:45.119
Caption: to read a value that&#39;s out of date

02:10:43.759 --> 02:10:46.718
Caption: a new value has been written somewhere

02:10:45.119 --> 02:10:49.199
Caption: else in the system but it&#39;s not yet

02:10:46.719 --> 02:10:51.119
Caption: visible to me but if i wait it will

02:10:49.199 --> 02:10:52.960
Caption: arrive

02:10:51.119 --> 02:10:55.280
Caption: but how long is eventually

02:10:52.959 --> 02:10:57.839
Caption: of course the answer is it depends

02:10:55.279 --> 02:11:00.479
Caption: it&#39;s milliseconds or often seconds but

02:10:57.839 --> 02:11:03.439
Caption: it could be hours when recovering from

02:11:00.479 --> 02:11:03.439
Caption: complex failures

02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:07.919
Caption: there also needs to be a way to decide

02:11:05.439 --> 02:11:09.439
Caption: how to convert these conflicting changes

02:11:07.919 --> 02:11:11.198
Caption: into one result

02:11:09.439 --> 02:11:12.879
Caption: the simplest approach is just last

02:11:11.199 --> 02:11:14.159
Caption: writer wins

02:11:12.879 --> 02:11:16.560
Caption: and this is a common choice in

02:11:14.159 --> 02:11:19.360
Caption: eventually consistent systems because

02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:21.040
Caption: you just compare the time stamps and

02:11:19.359 --> 02:11:21.919
Caption: take the latest one and discard the

02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:24.079
Caption: others

02:11:21.919 --> 02:11:25.839
Caption: it&#39;s intuitive enough but for it to be

02:11:24.079 --> 02:11:28.560
Caption: practical it depends on servers having

02:11:25.839 --> 02:11:30.479
Caption: fairly synchronized clocks

02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:32.879
Caption: algorithms exist to detect conflicts

02:11:30.479 --> 02:11:34.238
Caption: like logical clocks or vector clocks

02:11:32.879 --> 02:11:36.319
Caption: but they don&#39;t automatically resolve

02:11:34.238 --> 02:11:38.799
Caption: these conflicts necessarily and so a lot

02:11:36.319 --> 02:11:41.040
Caption: of ap systems design decided not to use

02:11:38.799 --> 02:11:41.040
Caption: them

02:11:42.238 --> 02:11:46.479
Caption: the reality is often never as simple as

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:50.238
Caption: a choice between these two opposites

02:11:46.479 --> 02:11:52.639
Caption: and this is true of cap the cp versus ap

02:11:50.238 --> 02:11:55.439
Caption: trade-off is more of a spectrum and

02:11:52.639 --> 02:11:56.959
Caption: databases exist somewhere in there

02:11:55.439 --> 02:11:58.959
Caption: a very important real-world factor

02:11:56.959 --> 02:12:00.159
Caption: that&#39;s missing from cap theorem is l for

02:11:58.959 --> 02:12:02.399
Caption: latency

02:12:00.159 --> 02:12:04.800
Caption: however how quick it is to read or write

02:12:02.399 --> 02:12:06.238
Caption: your data is often very important

02:12:04.799 --> 02:12:08.000
Caption: unfortunately there&#39;s a fundamental

02:12:06.238 --> 02:12:10.559
Caption: trade-off between consistency

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:12.319
Caption: availability and latency

02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:14.159
Caption: a big motivation for building these

02:12:12.319 --> 02:12:15.678
Caption: database systems to begin with was scale

02:12:14.159 --> 02:12:17.920
Caption: and performance

02:12:15.679 --> 02:12:19.760
Caption: amazon designed dynamo to serve its

02:12:17.919 --> 02:12:21.678
Caption: shopping cart

02:12:19.759 --> 02:12:24.399
Caption: google built bigtable to serve and store

02:12:21.679 --> 02:12:27.760
Caption: web search maps etc facebook built

02:12:24.399 --> 02:12:30.079
Caption: cassandra to power its inbox search

02:12:27.759 --> 02:12:31.919
Caption: linkedin and yahoo have similar examples

02:12:30.079 --> 02:12:33.679
Caption: these systems needed scalability and

02:12:31.919 --> 02:12:37.359
Caption: performance and this is a big part of

02:12:33.679 --> 02:12:39.119
Caption: why they were ap systems

02:12:37.359 --> 02:12:40.479
Caption: the potential trade-off you make as we

02:12:39.119 --> 02:12:42.639
Caption: discussed is the chance of reading

02:12:40.479 --> 02:12:44.560
Caption: inconsistent data

02:12:42.639 --> 02:12:46.639
Caption: this may be a non-issue when your data

02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:48.159
Caption: doesn&#39;t change much these systems will

02:12:46.639 --> 02:12:50.639
Caption: be a great fit for collecting mostly

02:12:48.159 --> 02:12:51.920
Caption: immutable data like telemetry events

02:12:50.639 --> 02:12:53.280
Caption: messages

02:12:51.919 --> 02:12:54.959
Caption: and they&#39;re also great for use cases

02:12:53.279 --> 02:12:56.238
Caption: where you&#39;re okay with the occasional

02:12:54.959 --> 02:12:57.839
Caption: glitch

02:12:56.238 --> 02:12:59.519
Caption: i&#39;m sure that on the rare occasion an

02:12:57.839 --> 02:13:01.759
Caption: item has just mysteriously disappeared

02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:03.679
Caption: from someone&#39;s amazon shopping cart

02:13:01.759 --> 02:13:06.078
Caption: has this hurt amazon&#39;s reputation or

02:13:03.679 --> 02:13:07.440
Caption: profits no

02:13:06.079 --> 02:13:09.119
Caption: and not every business who made this

02:13:07.439 --> 02:13:10.560
Caption: trade-off feels the same way though uber

02:13:09.119 --> 02:13:13.040
Caption: is one example that i&#39;ll talk about

02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:13.040
Caption: surely

02:13:13.199 --> 02:13:15.760
Caption: after a while working with these

02:13:14.399 --> 02:13:17.359
Caption: databases people were starting to

02:13:15.759 --> 02:13:19.439
Caption: realize the cap theorem while

02:13:17.359 --> 02:13:21.678
Caption: technically true and insightful wasn&#39;t

02:13:19.439 --> 02:13:23.599
Caption: really nuanced enough for them

02:13:21.679 --> 02:13:25.840
Caption: it&#39;s only an algorithmic property it

02:13:23.599 --> 02:13:27.919
Caption: doesn&#39;t guarantee that ap systems are

02:13:25.839 --> 02:13:29.678
Caption: actually up all the time

02:13:27.919 --> 02:13:30.639
Caption: so the other other ways to think about

02:13:29.679 --> 02:13:33.119
Caption: it

02:13:30.639 --> 02:13:35.520
Caption: so rick houlihan introduced this tasty

02:13:33.119 --> 02:13:36.880
Caption: concept called the pie theorem

02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:39.599
Caption: you can choose two of these three

02:13:36.879 --> 02:13:42.319
Caption: desirable properties of your data store

02:13:39.599 --> 02:13:43.520
Caption: pattern flexibility infinite scale and

02:13:42.319 --> 02:13:45.118
Caption: efficiency

02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:46.879
Caption: and we called it the iron triangle of

02:13:45.119 --> 02:13:48.800
Caption: purpose

02:13:46.879 --> 02:13:51.359
Caption: so for some examples a relational

02:13:48.799 --> 02:13:52.959
Caption: database is a pe system it&#39;s very

02:13:51.359 --> 02:13:54.319
Caption: flexible to query it&#39;s usually quite

02:13:52.959 --> 02:13:56.159
Caption: efficient but it definitely has a

02:13:54.319 --> 02:13:59.040
Caption: scaling cap

02:13:56.159 --> 02:14:01.520
Caption: a nosql database is an ie system

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:04.319
Caption: typically because it scales very well

02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:06.239
Caption: it&#39;s got great efficiency but you can&#39;t

02:14:04.319 --> 02:14:07.839
Caption: produce you can&#39;t do flexible queries

02:14:06.238 --> 02:14:09.039
Caption: that you haven&#39;t planned for to begin

02:14:07.839 --> 02:14:11.198
Caption: with

02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:15.280
Caption: a queryable data lake might be an ip

02:14:11.199 --> 02:14:16.960
Caption: system huge scale low efficiency

02:14:15.279 --> 02:14:18.399
Caption: so when you next need to choose a data

02:14:16.959 --> 02:14:20.560
Caption: store you should consider this model as

02:14:18.399 --> 02:14:20.560
Caption: well

02:14:21.119 --> 02:14:25.119
Caption: in addition people some people learnt

02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:26.479
Caption: the hard way that eventually consistent

02:14:25.119 --> 02:14:28.079
Caption: systems could be more troubled than

02:14:26.479 --> 02:14:30.560
Caption: their worth for instance google

02:14:28.079 --> 02:14:32.959
Caption: published this and i&#39;ll paraphrase it&#39;s

02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:34.560
Caption: hard to build bug-free systems

02:14:32.959 --> 02:14:37.279
Caption: when the database doesn&#39;t guarantee

02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:37.280
Caption: consistency

02:14:39.119 --> 02:14:43.280
Caption: the dynamodb offered by aws has the

02:14:41.439 --> 02:14:44.238
Caption: option of strong consistency within a

02:14:43.279 --> 02:14:46.078
Caption: region

02:14:44.238 --> 02:14:48.078
Caption: azure&#39;s cosmos db has the option of

02:14:46.079 --> 02:14:50.399
Caption: strong consistency google&#39;s three main

02:14:48.079 --> 02:14:52.079
Caption: databases for internal and external use

02:14:50.399 --> 02:14:54.000
Caption: they all offer some form of consistent

02:14:52.079 --> 02:14:56.159
Caption: strong consistency

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:58.879
Caption: some no sql data stores have since been

02:14:56.159 --> 02:15:01.199
Caption: extended or even custom built

02:14:58.879 --> 02:15:02.319
Caption: to support full asset transactions

02:15:01.199 --> 02:15:04.639
Caption: for example

02:15:02.319 --> 02:15:07.598
Caption: apple open source foundation db which is

02:15:04.639 --> 02:15:10.239
Caption: a highly scalable nosql database that

02:15:07.599 --> 02:15:12.320
Caption: supports full asset transactions

02:15:10.238 --> 02:15:13.919
Caption: and it powers apple&#39;s cloud kit service

02:15:12.319 --> 02:15:16.560
Caption: and snowflake uses it to store their

02:15:13.919 --> 02:15:16.560
Caption: metadata

02:15:17.439 --> 02:15:21.678
Caption: research continued in big tech as well

02:15:19.359 --> 02:15:23.359
Caption: as academia and a new generation of

02:15:21.679 --> 02:15:24.479
Caption: databases has emerged in the recent

02:15:23.359 --> 02:15:27.520
Caption: decade

02:15:24.479 --> 02:15:30.000
Caption: and these have been dubbed new sql

02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:31.839
Caption: it&#39;s a play on nosql but it represents

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.560
Caption: that they&#39;re a new generation of sql

02:15:31.839 --> 02:15:36.879
Caption: databases they can provide much higher

02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:38.479
Caption: scalability and availability

02:15:36.879 --> 02:15:40.560
Caption: without giving up the advantages of a

02:15:38.479 --> 02:15:42.718
Caption: relational database

02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:45.679
Caption: and this was seeded again by more papers

02:15:42.719 --> 02:15:47.440
Caption: released by google f1 and spanner

02:15:45.679 --> 02:15:48.959
Caption: this was novel and it

02:15:47.439 --> 02:15:51.279
Caption: inspired the creation of a number of

02:15:48.959 --> 02:15:54.238
Caption: similar databases

02:15:51.279 --> 02:15:56.399
Caption: some of these are cockroachdb thaidb and

02:15:54.238 --> 02:15:58.078
Caption: gigabyte db

02:15:56.399 --> 02:16:00.560
Caption: so i mentioned a little startup you

02:15:58.079 --> 02:16:02.479
Caption: might have heard of earlier uber

02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:04.719
Caption: uber handles billions of transactions

02:16:02.479 --> 02:16:06.718
Caption: per day now on their core order tracking

02:16:04.719 --> 02:16:08.159
Caption: system if you&#39;ve ordered an uber or an

02:16:06.719 --> 02:16:09.360
Caption: ubereats it&#39;s probably been through

02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:10.800
Caption: there

02:16:09.359 --> 02:16:13.198
Caption: and this was originally built on the

02:16:10.799 --> 02:16:14.959
Caption: cassandra database and they embraced

02:16:13.199 --> 02:16:17.360
Caption: eventual consistency in this system in

02:16:14.959 --> 02:16:19.439
Caption: order to get the scale they needed

02:16:17.359 --> 02:16:21.759
Caption: however they were still frustrated by

02:16:19.439 --> 02:16:23.359
Caption: occasional consistency problems

02:16:21.759 --> 02:16:24.638
Caption: and the complexity that&#39;s added to their

02:16:23.359 --> 02:16:26.079
Caption: code

02:16:24.639 --> 02:16:28.079
Caption: they&#39;ve publicly talked about this and

02:16:26.079 --> 02:16:30.079
Caption: how they&#39;ve done a full rewrite now to

02:16:28.079 --> 02:16:31.760
Caption: move to a consistent store

02:16:30.079 --> 02:16:34.080
Caption: and they&#39;re using google cloud spanner

02:16:31.759 --> 02:16:35.839
Caption: as the primary db

02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:36.959
Caption: as more examples netflix have blogged

02:16:35.839 --> 02:16:38.398
Caption: about how they&#39;re making use of

02:16:36.959 --> 02:16:40.160
Caption: cockroachdb

02:16:38.399 --> 02:16:42.399
Caption: and we&#39;re using cogrege to be at family

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:42.399
Caption: zone

02:16:43.359 --> 02:16:46.559
Caption: this all sounds too complicated why

02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:48.160
Caption: should i bother with the distributed

02:16:46.558 --> 02:16:50.478
Caption: database

02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:52.559
Caption: well if you don&#39;t have a need for high

02:16:50.478 --> 02:16:55.039
Caption: scalability and high availability you

02:16:52.558 --> 02:16:56.398
Caption: probably don&#39;t need one

02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:57.439
Caption: however more and more apps find

02:16:56.399 --> 02:16:58.959
Caption: themselves

02:16:57.439 --> 02:17:00.960
Caption: needing to handle bigger and bigger data

02:16:58.959 --> 02:17:04.478
Caption: sets and sometimes said that the common

02:17:00.959 --> 02:17:04.478
Caption: app is becoming a big data app

02:17:04.638 --> 02:17:08.318
Caption: the distributed databases that exist

02:17:06.399 --> 02:17:10.399
Caption: today are the culmination of decades of

02:17:08.319 --> 02:17:12.959
Caption: research and development so you can have

02:17:10.399 --> 02:17:15.599
Caption: your cake and eat it too with scalable

02:17:12.959 --> 02:17:18.240
Caption: transactional databases that support sql

02:17:15.598 --> 02:17:19.518
Caption: and the relational model

02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:20.399
Caption: and there are choices available out

02:17:19.518 --> 02:17:22.079
Caption: there

02:17:20.399 --> 02:17:24.800
Caption: in addition to what&#39;s offered up by your

02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:24.799
Caption: cloud provider

02:17:25.598 --> 02:17:29.678
Caption: beware of giving up strong consistency

02:17:27.518 --> 02:17:32.079
Caption: or at least be sure why you don&#39;t need

02:17:29.678 --> 02:17:33.919
Caption: it before you give it up

02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:35.598
Caption: if you need to work around the database

02:17:33.919 --> 02:17:38.718
Caption: then perhaps it wasn&#39;t the ideal choice

02:17:35.598 --> 02:17:38.718
Caption: for your problem

02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:42.240
Caption: despite these these breakthroughs

02:17:40.638 --> 02:17:44.879
Caption: there&#39;s still no one-size-fits-all

02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:46.559
Caption: distributed database solution

02:17:44.879 --> 02:17:48.080
Caption: there are generally purpose-built data

02:17:46.558 --> 02:17:49.598
Caption: stores that might be ideal for your

02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:51.439
Caption: particular workload

02:17:49.598 --> 02:17:53.120
Caption: perhaps an analytical database was what

02:17:51.439 --> 02:17:54.880
Caption: you actually needed or even a graph

02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:57.359
Caption: database

02:17:54.879 --> 02:17:59.200
Caption: so do your research before you jump

02:17:57.359 --> 02:18:01.919

02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:39.200
Caption: i think there&#39;s probably

02:18:36.799 --> 02:18:40.478
Caption: a lot of nuance to that but

02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:41.599
Caption: i think

02:18:40.478 --> 02:18:44.000
Caption: if you&#39;re

02:18:41.598 --> 02:18:45.839
Caption: if your organization justifies it so you

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:47.439
Caption: have a big enough need

02:18:45.839 --> 02:18:49.040
Caption: for using more than one database because

02:18:47.439 --> 02:18:50.240
Caption: you need people that understand the

02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:51.678
Caption: different technologies you need to

02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:53.839
Caption: maintain those different technologies so

02:18:51.678 --> 02:18:55.200
Caption: if you need the scale yes if you don&#39;t

02:18:53.839 --> 02:18:58.000
Caption: need the scale

02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:59.599
Caption: that&#39;s where i&#39;d consider just making do

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.518
Caption: with one but

02:18:59.598 --> 02:19:03.759
Caption: absolutely if you

02:19:01.518 --> 02:19:06.558
Caption: the point was that they&#39;re purpose-built

02:19:03.759 --> 02:19:08.240
Caption: so if one suits your need very well

02:19:06.558 --> 02:19:11.199
Caption: use it for that need

02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:13.599
Caption: um but you know that&#39;s easy to say and

02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:15.359
Caption: and reality usually dictates that only

02:19:13.598 --> 02:19:18.000
Caption: if it it&#39;s got the money behind it to

02:19:15.359 --> 02:19:18.000
Caption: justify it

02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:22.638

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.719

02:24:38.719 --> 02:24:43.839

Caption: i&#39;ve put this together because

02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:53.359
Caption: i&#39;m i think that it&#39;s

02:29:51.839 --> 02:29:55.519
Caption: while it seems so simple it&#39;s a text

02:29:53.359 --> 02:29:56.880
Caption: editor there&#39;s so many hidden things in

02:29:55.519 --> 02:29:59.519
Caption: it um but

02:29:56.879 --> 02:30:00.959
Caption: to get started i&#39;m going to just make

02:29:59.519 --> 02:30:02.799
Caption: sure that you know for those of you that

02:30:00.959 --> 02:30:04.879
Caption: haven&#39;t used vs code before or you

02:30:02.799 --> 02:30:06.160
Caption: haven&#39;t had um i had much experience

02:30:04.879 --> 02:30:08.160

Caption: vs code um i&#39;ve got a project of mine

02:30:14.478 --> 02:30:17.438

02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:19.200
Caption: text it&#39;s not particularly interesting

02:30:17.439 --> 02:30:20.479
Caption: or relevant um but what i&#39;m going to do

02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:23.759
Caption: is i want to break down the core

02:30:20.478 --> 02:30:26.239

02:30:32.399 --> 02:30:35.600
Caption: but the interesting thing about the vs

02:30:33.919 --> 02:30:37.519
Caption: code one is that

02:30:35.599 --> 02:30:39.040
Caption: it&#39;s highly customizable in fact like

02:30:37.519 --> 02:30:41.039
Caption: everything in vs code is highly

02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:43.200
Caption: customizable so at the top it&#39;s got

02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:44.559
Caption: things like there the file name um of

02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:46.640
Caption: the file that we&#39;ve currently got open

02:30:44.559 --> 02:30:47.759
Caption: it&#39;s got the the um information about

02:30:46.639 --> 02:30:48.719
Caption: the

02:30:47.759 --> 02:30:51.279
Caption: repo

02:30:48.719 --> 02:30:53.040
Caption: this is connected to i&#39;m connected to a

02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:54.640
Caption: remote vs code instance so i&#39;m using it

02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:56.799
Caption: with wsl so it&#39;s got that information in

02:30:54.639 --> 02:30:58.318
Caption: there but you can actually edit that and

02:30:56.799 --> 02:30:59.679
Caption: change you know strip out information

02:30:58.319 --> 02:31:01.359
Caption: you don&#39;t think is going to be needed or

02:30:59.679 --> 02:31:03.679
Caption: you don&#39;t want to display in there and

02:31:01.359 --> 02:31:06.080
Caption: this can be really uh really useful some

02:31:03.679 --> 02:31:08.879
Caption: someone that has um maybe some attention

02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:10.719
Caption: uh issues or some um some neurodiversion

02:31:08.879 --> 02:31:12.559
Caption: in that regards i can strip out the

02:31:10.719 --> 02:31:13.679
Caption: stuff that isn&#39;t like i don&#39;t need to

02:31:12.559 --> 02:31:15.438
Caption: have it there i don&#39;t need to tell me

02:31:13.679 --> 02:31:17.438
Caption: i&#39;m in vs code because i know i&#39;m in vs

02:31:15.439 --> 02:31:19.359
Caption: code um for example you can you can

02:31:17.439 --> 02:31:21.680
Caption: modify it to be the editor that you need

02:31:19.359 --> 02:31:23.760
Caption: it to be

02:31:21.679 --> 02:31:25.519
Caption: we have the sidebar um on the left hand

02:31:23.759 --> 02:31:28.080
Caption: side um i actually hit mine on the right

02:31:25.519 --> 02:31:30.478
Caption: hand side and no i&#39;ll show you uh why

02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:32.319
Caption: when uh jump into actually editor but

02:31:30.478 --> 02:31:33.839
Caption: this is where we have like our files and

02:31:32.319 --> 02:31:35.359
Caption: our folder structure that&#39;s all there

02:31:33.839 --> 02:31:37.919
Caption: it&#39;s where we get to the debugger we get

02:31:35.359 --> 02:31:41.120
Caption: to source control so we can um like make

02:31:37.919 --> 02:31:42.478
Caption: our commits into the git repo or um

02:31:41.120 --> 02:31:45.600
Caption: is there any other source control that

02:31:42.478 --> 02:31:46.879
Caption: people still use i&#39;m like it&#39;s like

02:31:45.599 --> 02:31:50.639
Caption: svn

02:31:46.879 --> 02:31:52.639
Caption: oh now now am i really dating myself cvs

02:31:50.639 --> 02:31:53.679
Caption: anyone anyone cbs

02:31:52.639 --> 02:31:54.559
Caption: yeah

02:31:53.679 --> 02:31:56.239
Caption: um

02:31:54.559 --> 02:31:58.079
Caption: but so the other thing with the sidebar

02:31:56.240 --> 02:32:00.319
Caption: is that uh extensions that you can add

02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:01.599
Caption: to vs code um can also introduce things

02:32:00.319 --> 02:32:03.200
Caption: in here uh so i&#39;ve got a couple of

02:32:01.599 --> 02:32:04.799
Caption: additional icons down the bottom there

02:32:03.200 --> 02:32:07.439
Caption: the azure extension a docker extension

02:32:04.799 --> 02:32:09.438
Caption: and a few things like that so that um

02:32:07.439 --> 02:32:10.479
Caption: there&#39;s functionality specific to that

02:32:09.439 --> 02:32:12.720
Caption: and a

02:32:10.478 --> 02:32:13.599
Caption: complex extension like the azure one

02:32:12.719 --> 02:32:14.719
Caption: that allows you work with azure

02:32:13.599 --> 02:32:15.839
Caption: resources

02:32:14.719 --> 02:32:17.358
Caption: it&#39;s all there and i can do it with

02:32:15.839 --> 02:32:19.839
Caption: inside of the editor so the actual goes

02:32:17.359 --> 02:32:21.120
Caption: beyond just being a

02:32:19.839 --> 02:32:23.280
Caption: text editing

02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:25.120
Caption: place it&#39;s also a more complex tool

02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:25.919
Caption: there are seats up the front feel like

02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:28.959
Caption: you don&#39;t feel like you need to

02:32:25.919 --> 02:32:28.959
Caption: awkwardly stand around the back

02:32:29.759 --> 02:32:33.200
Caption: um down the bottom we have our status

02:32:31.359 --> 02:32:35.600
Caption: bar and this is again showing just a

02:32:33.200 --> 02:32:38.160
Caption: whole bunch of uh like little quick

02:32:35.599 --> 02:32:40.559
Caption: quick pieces of information um things

02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:42.479
Caption: like what branch we on in the the git

02:32:40.559 --> 02:32:44.799
Caption: repo that we&#39;ve got open are there any

02:32:42.478 --> 02:32:47.358
Caption: errors or warnings in the project that

02:32:44.799 --> 02:32:49.679
Caption: i&#39;ve got open um you know what&#39;s the

02:32:47.359 --> 02:32:51.200
Caption: what&#39;s the lining coatings because

02:32:49.679 --> 02:32:53.599
Caption: that&#39;s a painful thing there are still

02:32:51.200 --> 02:32:54.879
Caption: seats please do come in um

02:32:53.599 --> 02:32:56.559
Caption: don&#39;t you don&#39;t feel like you need to

02:32:54.879 --> 02:32:59.919
Caption: stand in the doorway

02:32:56.559 --> 02:33:01.279
Caption: um no uh and like what what uh language

02:32:59.919 --> 02:33:02.799
Caption: service is being used so this is it&#39;s a

02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:04.799
Caption: html file that&#39;s got open so terminates

02:33:02.799 --> 02:33:06.160
Caption: html but i can change that to what and

02:33:04.799 --> 02:33:09.759
Caption: that indicates then and that can be

02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:12.959
Caption: useful if you you&#39;ve uh working with

02:33:09.759 --> 02:33:15.679
Caption: multiple languages that uh maybe uh more

02:33:12.959 --> 02:33:17.040
Caption: esoteric than uh kind of just

02:33:15.679 --> 02:33:18.719
Caption: your common run-of-the-mill sort of

02:33:17.040 --> 02:33:20.879
Caption: stuff but again you can turn as much of

02:33:18.719 --> 02:33:22.080
Caption: this stuff off as you want because again

02:33:20.879 --> 02:33:24.080
Caption: you might not want that information you

02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:26.719
Caption: might not need it there because you know

02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:28.240
Caption: it&#39;s contextually irrelevant to you or

02:33:26.719 --> 02:33:30.799
Caption: you find it distracting to have that

02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:32.720
Caption: kind of stuff all there

02:33:30.799 --> 02:33:33.839
Caption: then we&#39;ve got our terminal across the

02:33:32.719 --> 02:33:35.599
Caption: bottom so there&#39;s an integrated terminal

02:33:33.839 --> 02:33:37.040
Caption: in vs code um

02:33:35.599 --> 02:33:39.199
Caption: that we can we can open up we can open

02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:40.879
Caption: up as many terminal windows as we can um

02:33:39.200 --> 02:33:42.080
Caption: when i&#39;m working i tend to have just vs

02:33:40.879 --> 02:33:43.438
Caption: code open and i don&#39;t even have a

02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:44.879
Caption: separate terminal app running anymore i

02:33:43.439 --> 02:33:46.880
Caption: just pop the terminal up

02:33:44.879 --> 02:33:48.879
Caption: run my npm commands or run my git

02:33:46.879 --> 02:33:51.200
Caption: installs oh sorry get my commands and

02:33:48.879 --> 02:33:53.519
Caption: stuff like that um all within here also

02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:56.640
Caption: interestingly um if you do run like a

02:33:53.519 --> 02:33:57.438
Caption: node uh command so like an um npm start

02:33:56.639 --> 02:33:59.519
Caption: to

02:33:57.439 --> 02:34:01.120
Caption: how to run a web server from the vs go

02:33:59.519 --> 02:34:02.959
Caption: terminal it will automatically attach a

02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:04.799
Caption: debugger for you you don&#39;t even have to

02:34:02.959 --> 02:34:07.040
Caption: like do anything extra to get debugging

02:34:04.799 --> 02:34:09.280
Caption: running for like a node application

02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:11.759
Caption: yeah npm start there&#39;s your debugger

02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:13.359
Caption: already ready to go

02:34:11.759 --> 02:34:14.959
Caption: um and then there&#39;s actually a text

02:34:13.359 --> 02:34:16.240
Caption: editing surface as well

02:34:14.959 --> 02:34:17.519
Caption: like

02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:18.879
Caption: it&#39;s been like five minutes and i

02:34:17.519 --> 02:34:21.119
Caption: haven&#39;t talked about the fact that you

02:34:18.879 --> 02:34:22.959
Caption: can edit a text document

02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:25.280
Caption: in a text editor

02:34:22.959 --> 02:34:27.200
Caption: but i mean you can it&#39;s it&#39;s obviously

02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:28.319
Caption: the core feature um

02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:29.600
Caption: it does all the things you&#39;d expect from

02:34:28.319 --> 02:34:32.560
Caption: a text editor it does syntax

02:34:29.599 --> 02:34:33.759
Caption: highlighting um i have like errors and

02:34:32.559 --> 02:34:35.438
Caption: stuff like that will appear if the

02:34:33.759 --> 02:34:38.080
Caption: language service that you&#39;re using is um

02:34:35.439 --> 02:34:39.840
Caption: is surfacing that information up um

02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:41.919
Caption: and then this is a html file

02:34:39.839 --> 02:34:43.358
Caption: it&#39;s got a variety of colors in there to

02:34:41.919 --> 02:34:44.398
Caption: indicate the different things inside of

02:34:43.359 --> 02:34:46.399
Caption: that

02:34:44.399 --> 02:34:48.240
Caption: and lastly we have our mini map view of

02:34:46.399 --> 02:34:50.560
Caption: the file so there&#39;s like a 10 000 view

02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:51.919
Caption: of the file that you&#39;re in um and this

02:34:50.559 --> 02:34:53.119
Caption: is not a particularly long file so it&#39;s

02:34:51.919 --> 02:34:55.759
Caption: all condensed up the top and you can see

02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:57.120
Caption: even like the colorization appears there

02:34:55.759 --> 02:34:59.200
Caption: but this can be useful if you&#39;re

02:34:57.120 --> 02:35:01.759
Caption: scrolling through a

02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:03.520
Caption: thousand long thousands of like a file

02:35:01.759 --> 02:35:05.200
Caption: that&#39;s like a thousand lines long

02:35:03.519 --> 02:35:06.639
Caption: not that anyone&#39;s writing like single

02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.799
Caption: files that are like

02:35:06.639 --> 02:35:10.318
Caption: like several thousands lines no no one

02:35:08.799 --> 02:35:12.240
Caption: does that do they

02:35:10.319 --> 02:35:15.359
Caption: no i see some i see some awkward uh

02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:16.399
Caption: awkward nodding of the head there

02:35:15.359 --> 02:35:18.560
Caption: um

02:35:16.399 --> 02:35:21.200
Caption: all right so that&#39;s vs code in a very

02:35:18.559 --> 02:35:22.719
Caption: quick nutshell uh and kind of like all

02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:25.439
Caption: like all the different aspects obvious

02:35:22.719 --> 02:35:27.279
Caption: code and the things that are in there so

02:35:25.439 --> 02:35:29.120
Caption: let&#39;s now

02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:31.359
Caption: talk about like how can we use it to be

02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:34.560
Caption: productive and for me being productive

02:35:31.359 --> 02:35:36.160
Caption: means keyboard like i&#39;m i&#39;m a keyboard

02:35:34.559 --> 02:35:37.759
Caption: user i i

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:39.439
Caption: don&#39;t have an external mouse like when

02:35:37.759 --> 02:35:40.639
Caption: i&#39;m when i&#39;m using my laptop i don&#39;t use

02:35:39.439 --> 02:35:41.760
Caption: an external mouse i don&#39;t use an

02:35:40.639 --> 02:35:42.719
Caption: external mouse at home because i have a

02:35:41.759 --> 02:35:45.358
Caption: desktop

02:35:42.719 --> 02:35:46.879
Caption: but i so i&#39;ve done everything i can to

02:35:45.359 --> 02:35:48.399
Caption: try and memorize as many keyboard

02:35:46.879 --> 02:35:50.478
Caption: shortcuts as i can

02:35:48.399 --> 02:35:51.920
Caption: um i know a scary amount of word

02:35:50.478 --> 02:35:53.199
Caption: shortcuts

02:35:51.919 --> 02:35:54.559
Caption: so like

02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:57.520
Caption: i can power using my way through

02:35:54.559 --> 02:35:59.199
Caption: microsoft word um but yeah also in vs

02:35:57.519 --> 02:36:00.398
Caption: code um

02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:02.080
Caption: and

02:36:00.399 --> 02:36:03.280
Caption: let&#39;s jump over

02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:05.520
Caption: there&#39;s enough slides for a moment let&#39;s

02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:06.959
Caption: jump over and actually have a look at vs

02:36:05.519 --> 02:36:09.358
Caption: code and some stuff that we&#39;ve got in

02:36:06.959 --> 02:36:12.160
Caption: here so i&#39;m i&#39;ve got a a couple of

02:36:09.359 --> 02:36:13.600
Caption: different vs codes this is open um

02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:15.520
Caption: the the you should be able to read the

02:36:13.599 --> 02:36:17.358
Caption: text but again don&#39;t worry about the

02:36:15.519 --> 02:36:18.879
Caption: text in there this is mostly my notes so

02:36:17.359 --> 02:36:21.520
Caption: feel free to read ahead and just then

02:36:18.879 --> 02:36:24.080
Caption: zone out to me uh because this is what

02:36:21.519 --> 02:36:27.519
Caption: i&#39;m going to be covering uh but

02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:29.040
Caption: if there is only one shortcut key in vs

02:36:27.519 --> 02:36:31.119
Caption: code that you learn

02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:33.599
Caption: it is control p

02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:36.160
Caption: this brings up um the defaults to the

02:36:33.599 --> 02:36:38.239
Caption: file picker so i can use this to find

02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:40.399
Caption: the readme file hit enter it opens the

02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:43.359
Caption: file i&#39;m currently in um but we can also

02:36:40.399 --> 02:36:44.720
Caption: use uh this to say type a question mark

02:36:43.359 --> 02:36:47.760
Caption: and here are all the other things that

02:36:44.719 --> 02:36:49.358
Caption: we can get from this um

02:36:47.759 --> 02:36:51.599
Caption: it moves on from being just a file a

02:36:49.359 --> 02:36:53.840
Caption: file picker to being a command palette

02:36:51.599 --> 02:36:55.279
Caption: so i could do a greater than symbol and

02:36:53.839 --> 02:36:56.959
Caption: then these are all the things like the

02:36:55.280 --> 02:36:58.879
Caption: actions i can form within

02:36:56.959 --> 02:37:01.519
Caption: this code i can

02:36:58.879 --> 02:37:02.398
Caption: open the settings or i can go

02:37:01.519 --> 02:37:05.438
Caption: to

02:37:02.399 --> 02:37:07.280
Caption: uh like so i&#39;ve actually traveled on a

02:37:05.439 --> 02:37:09.280
Caption: thing called screencast mode uh so as i

02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:11.040
Caption: type the keyboard shortcuts uh they&#39;ll

02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:12.399
Caption: pop up quickly on the screen so you know

02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:14.559
Caption: i&#39;m like here&#39;s the keyboard shortcut

02:37:12.399 --> 02:37:16.840
Caption: you&#39;re like i can&#39;t see the keyboard

02:37:14.559 --> 02:37:19.438
Caption: aaron you&#39;re up there and there&#39;s a

02:37:16.839 --> 02:37:21.438
Caption: screen um so i&#39;ve got that turned on so

02:37:19.439 --> 02:37:23.280
Caption: you can see uh so

02:37:21.439 --> 02:37:25.200
Caption: ctrl p comes to the file picker control

02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:27.600
Caption: shift p

02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:30.399
Caption: if i hit the correct keys um go straight

02:37:27.599 --> 02:37:31.599
Caption: to the actions so uh this is just like

02:37:30.399 --> 02:37:33.359
Caption: it&#39;s a quick one because this is

02:37:31.599 --> 02:37:35.279
Caption: probably the most common thing that you

02:37:33.359 --> 02:37:37.200
Caption: tend to do from the file picker uh so

02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:38.959
Caption: from from the the command palette

02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:41.520
Caption: um other things i like like if i type

02:37:38.959 --> 02:37:43.599
Caption: view and get to the sidebar um on the

02:37:41.519 --> 02:37:44.639
Caption: right hand side there oh if i fall to

02:37:43.599 --> 02:37:46.398
Caption: the left-hand side i move it to the

02:37:44.639 --> 02:37:49.199
Caption: right-hand side because

02:37:46.399 --> 02:37:51.040
Caption: if i expand it and collapse it

02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:52.799
Caption: it pops in and out if i have it on the

02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:54.879
Caption: left let&#39;s see if i can remember how to

02:37:52.799 --> 02:37:56.000
Caption: move it to the left

02:37:54.879 --> 02:37:58.000
Caption: i actually can&#39;t remember how to move it

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:59.839
Caption: to the left it&#39;s somewhere in settings

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Caption: it&#39;s been so long since i&#39;ve done that

02:37:59.839 --> 02:38:02.959
Caption: oh was it

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:05.919
Caption: ah

02:38:02.959 --> 02:38:08.080
Caption: excellent there we go um control b hides

02:38:05.919 --> 02:38:10.160
Caption: and shows it but this is really annoying

02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:12.399
Caption: for me because you now you your your

02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:15.040
Caption: focal point is um is shifting because

02:38:12.399 --> 02:38:17.840
Caption: the the editor&#39;s surface is moving so

02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:20.879
Caption: that&#39;s why i move mine to the right

02:38:17.839 --> 02:38:23.679
Caption: um anyway so ctrl p view and then i can

02:38:20.879 --> 02:38:27.280
Caption: go to explorer pop up into this bit or

02:38:23.679 --> 02:38:29.519
Caption: control b p view uh debug

02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:31.280
Caption: and get to the debug section

02:38:29.519 --> 02:38:33.279
Caption: um so i don&#39;t have to maybe like

02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:35.040
Caption: memorize um the shortcut keys i think

02:38:33.280 --> 02:38:36.959
Caption: that&#39;s well

02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:40.160
Caption: f5 i think might get you to that i

02:38:36.959 --> 02:38:43.679
Caption: forget but i just do control p view um

02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:46.319
Caption: but also then i can say in explorer

02:38:43.679 --> 02:38:48.799
Caption: if i was in explorer i can then go to

02:38:46.319 --> 02:38:51.200
Caption: like the uh the folders or the outline

02:38:48.799 --> 02:38:53.679
Caption: view or um you know so i can actually

02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:56.719
Caption: navigate the sub menus within all the

02:38:53.679 --> 02:38:58.799
Caption: subsections with inside of um the the

02:38:56.719 --> 02:39:00.719
Caption: sidebar um using the command palette

02:38:58.799 --> 02:39:02.000
Caption: again just all off the off the keyboard

02:39:00.719 --> 02:39:05.200
Caption: there

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:06.719
Caption: other one um term for uh quick access to

02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:08.560
Caption: anything to do with terminals

02:39:06.719 --> 02:39:09.919
Caption: and create a new terminal

02:39:08.559 --> 02:39:11.839
Caption: that one&#39;s to be down there i&#39;m going to

02:39:09.919 --> 02:39:13.120
Caption: turn

02:39:11.839 --> 02:39:13.919
Caption: whoops

02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:15.600
Caption: turn

02:39:13.919 --> 02:39:17.839
Caption: and then i can create

02:39:15.599 --> 02:39:20.239
Caption: another terminal

02:39:17.839 --> 02:39:22.318
Caption: and then i can swap between them

02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:23.839
Caption: um but with terminals

02:39:22.319 --> 02:39:25.680
Caption: they&#39;re all called zsh because that&#39;s

02:39:23.839 --> 02:39:27.280
Caption: the shell that i&#39;m using in this case uh

02:39:25.679 --> 02:39:29.358
Caption: but it&#39;s like well which one which one&#39;s

02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:30.720
Caption: which how do i easily know that well

02:39:29.359 --> 02:39:32.000
Caption: ctrl shift p

02:39:30.719 --> 02:39:34.239
Caption: command palette and then we&#39;re going to

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:35.519
Caption: go terminal rename and we&#39;ll call this

02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:37.280
Caption: one we&#39;ll call this git because i&#39;m

02:39:35.519 --> 02:39:39.759
Caption: going to use that for my git operations

02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:41.200
Caption: and now if i go control p term i can

02:39:39.759 --> 02:39:43.200
Caption: type git

02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:44.240
Caption: and jump to that particular terminal so

02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:46.000
Caption: this is usually if you&#39;ve got a couple

02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:47.280
Caption: opens maybe you&#39;re maybe you&#39;re building

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.799
Caption: an application that&#39;s got a like a front

02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:50.080
Caption: end and a back end and you&#39;ve got a

02:39:48.799 --> 02:39:52.398
Caption: couple of terminals open ones running

02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:54.799
Caption: the back end like the npm command to run

02:39:52.399 --> 02:39:55.920
Caption: the back end the others uh the the front

02:39:54.799 --> 02:39:58.000
Caption: end web application so you&#39;ve got

02:39:55.919 --> 02:40:00.240
Caption: multiple um terminals running node

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:01.599
Caption: processors well you can rename them so

02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:03.040
Caption: that you can jump back and forth and you

02:40:01.599 --> 02:40:04.639
Caption: can see the uh

02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:06.399
Caption: which one like the log messages from the

02:40:04.639 --> 02:40:08.239
Caption: right one um easily

02:40:06.399 --> 02:40:09.840
Caption: from there

02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:12.080
Caption: all right um

02:40:09.839 --> 02:40:12.080
Caption: so

02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:17.040
Caption: yeah uh control p probably like the

02:40:15.359 --> 02:40:20.840
Caption: number one shortcut to take away and to

02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:20.839
Caption: remember from this

02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:23.439
Caption: now

02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:24.799
Caption: i&#39;m talking about screencast mode which

02:40:23.439 --> 02:40:26.800
Caption: i&#39;ve got turned on and we can get to

02:40:24.799 --> 02:40:29.519
Caption: that from settings control comma we&#39;ll

02:40:26.799 --> 02:40:31.040
Caption: get to settings we type screen

02:40:29.519 --> 02:40:33.519
Caption: casts

02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:36.000
Caption: and i have that turned on here you can

02:40:33.519 --> 02:40:38.478
Caption: actually hide terminals uh control

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.679
Caption: backtick will collapse the terminals um

02:40:38.478 --> 02:40:42.398
Caption: area at the bottom

02:40:39.679 --> 02:40:45.279
Caption: hide and show short backtick uh and so

02:40:42.399 --> 02:40:47.040
Caption: control b to collapse that um so with uh

02:40:45.280 --> 02:40:48.399
Caption: with screencast mode um

02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:50.240
Caption: this can be good for pair programming as

02:40:48.399 --> 02:40:53.359
Caption: well uh so you&#39;re uh whether you&#39;re

02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:54.560
Caption: doing it like as a um like a remote pair

02:40:53.359 --> 02:40:56.000
Caption: programming session or you&#39;ve just got

02:40:54.559 --> 02:40:57.040
Caption: someone um that&#39;s sitting next to you

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.160
Caption: and you don&#39;t want them kind of

02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:00.000
Caption: breathing down your neck trying to work

02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:01.600
Caption: out well i see what you&#39;re doing um and

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:03.599
Caption: just tonguing it on can be a useful

02:41:01.599 --> 02:41:05.599
Caption: thing but you can you know it can be a

02:41:03.599 --> 02:41:07.919
Caption: little bit annoying because like every

02:41:05.599 --> 02:41:09.358
Caption: key stroke is getting captured in here

02:41:07.919 --> 02:41:11.040
Caption: but i can change that

02:41:09.359 --> 02:41:12.479
Caption: and say that i only want it to show just

02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:14.160
Caption: like the commands so if i&#39;m using the

02:41:12.478 --> 02:41:15.839
Caption: command or i&#39;ll sort those kind of keys

02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:17.200
Caption: it&#39;ll just show those up

02:41:15.839 --> 02:41:18.559
Caption: and that can be a bit more useful i

02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:19.839
Caption: guess if you&#39;re doing demos and stuff

02:41:18.559 --> 02:41:22.159
Caption: like that

02:41:19.839 --> 02:41:24.879
Caption: change font size change styling all that

02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:24.879
Caption: kind of stuff there

02:41:25.759 --> 02:41:29.040
Caption: another useful

02:41:27.679 --> 02:41:32.799
Caption: mode of

02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:35.200
Caption: vs code is zen mode control k zed

02:41:32.799 --> 02:41:36.559
Caption: yeah you just like you you want to kind

02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:38.160
Caption: of turn off as many of the distractions

02:41:36.559 --> 02:41:39.599
Caption: as you&#39;ve got because you you know you

02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:41.359
Caption: you&#39;re in you&#39;re in the moment like

02:41:39.599 --> 02:41:43.199
Caption: you&#39;re trying to you know get through a

02:41:41.359 --> 02:41:44.640
Caption: bug or whatever the case may be

02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:45.919
Caption: um this

02:41:44.639 --> 02:41:46.959
Caption: as you can see it&#39;s hidden pretty much

02:41:45.919 --> 02:41:49.359
Caption: everything we&#39;ve hit in the sidebar

02:41:46.959 --> 02:41:51.519
Caption: we&#39;ve hidden the status bar um the the

02:41:49.359 --> 02:41:52.720
Caption: top menus um hidden like we don&#39;t even

02:41:51.519 --> 02:41:54.079
Caption: have the you can&#39;t even see the

02:41:52.719 --> 02:41:55.679
Caption: different files we&#39;ve got open i only

02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:57.679
Caption: have one file open at the moment anyway

02:41:55.679 --> 02:41:59.438
Caption: but like you would you can control tab

02:41:57.679 --> 02:42:01.199
Caption: to get between the the files but yeah

02:41:59.439 --> 02:42:03.120
Caption: this is like you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a

02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:05.040
Caption: focus mode like we&#39;ve hidden everything

02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:06.560
Caption: that could be a potential distraction

02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:08.639
Caption: just so we can focus on the thing that

02:42:06.559 --> 02:42:11.438
Caption: we&#39;re currently trying to do

02:42:08.639 --> 02:42:13.358
Caption: uh ctrl k said to get back out of that

02:42:11.439 --> 02:42:15.359
Caption: uh there are a bunch of settings for zen

02:42:13.359 --> 02:42:16.479
Caption: mode as well so let&#39;s say that it&#39;s

02:42:15.359 --> 02:42:18.800
Caption: actually maybe a little bit too

02:42:16.478 --> 02:42:21.199
Caption: aggressive i do still want to have uh

02:42:18.799 --> 02:42:22.799
Caption: line numbers in here i can

02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:23.759
Caption: say that well no don&#39;t hide the line

02:42:22.799 --> 02:42:25.679
Caption: numbers

02:42:23.759 --> 02:42:26.879
Caption: go back into z mode

02:42:25.679 --> 02:42:28.799
Caption: so i can still have my line numbers in

02:42:26.879 --> 02:42:30.719
Caption: there because i like i find now useful

02:42:28.799 --> 02:42:32.398
Caption: so i can navigate up and down or i know

02:42:30.719 --> 02:42:34.080
Caption: where uh where i&#39;m at and things like

02:42:32.399 --> 02:42:36.160
Caption: that

02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:38.959
Caption: customize it for the way that you want

02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:40.959
Caption: to use it it&#39;s not just the it&#39;s not

02:42:38.959 --> 02:42:43.280
Caption: just trying to be an editor that is

02:42:40.959 --> 02:42:44.399
Caption: generic and you like it it forces you to

02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:46.240
Caption: work in a particular way now you

02:42:44.399 --> 02:42:47.600
Caption: customize it for the needs that you&#39;ve

02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:48.959
Caption: got

02:42:47.599 --> 02:42:49.599
Caption: uh and i&#39;m just going to turn that back

02:42:48.959 --> 02:42:53.200
Caption: on

02:42:49.599 --> 02:42:54.559
Caption: so that my zen mode is nice

02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:55.759
Caption: clean

02:42:54.559 --> 02:42:56.559
Caption: um

02:42:55.759 --> 02:42:59.040
Caption: from

02:42:56.559 --> 02:43:00.318
Caption: uh from an accessibility standpoint uh

02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:02.000
Caption: there&#39;s been a lot of work in vs code to

02:43:00.319 --> 02:43:04.479
Caption: make that uh

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:05.519
Caption: an easy editor to use um and something

02:43:04.478 --> 02:43:08.000
Caption: that

02:43:05.519 --> 02:43:09.919
Caption: i think that people don&#39;t consider um

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:11.120
Caption: too much and and what and i know i

02:43:09.919 --> 02:43:13.759
Caption: didn&#39;t consider this for a long time but

02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:16.240
Caption: i used to work with a colleague who um

02:43:13.759 --> 02:43:18.240
Caption: has albinoism and he had very poor

02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:21.200
Caption: eyesight as a result of that so he had

02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:23.200
Caption: to have his font um incredibly large so

02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:24.719
Caption: that he could read it and and that kind

02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:26.719
Caption: of stuff but

02:43:24.719 --> 02:43:28.879
Caption: that can be a problem when you&#39;re

02:43:26.719 --> 02:43:30.000
Caption: working on code files because we tend to

02:43:28.879 --> 02:43:32.000
Caption: well

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:34.478
Caption: i&#39;m lazy so i just you know write things

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:37.040
Caption: as long as i can like i&#39;ve got a giant

02:43:34.478 --> 02:43:39.759
Caption: screen at home and a reasonable enough

02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:41.359
Caption: eyesight so i&#39;m quite content to have

02:43:39.759 --> 02:43:43.519
Caption: you know hundreds and hundreds of

02:43:41.359 --> 02:43:45.120
Caption: characters spread across a 32 inch

02:43:43.519 --> 02:43:46.079
Caption: monitor because that&#39;s like that&#39;s my

02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:47.839
Caption: working

02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:48.799
Caption: experience but that might not be great

02:43:47.839 --> 02:43:50.959
Caption: for everyone

02:43:48.799 --> 02:43:53.040
Caption: on the team so we can turn on editor

02:43:50.959 --> 02:43:55.919
Caption: rules in uh

02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:58.080
Caption: vs code whoops let me just control

02:43:55.919 --> 02:44:01.359
Caption: control k control u to comment and

02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:04.319
Caption: uncomment um so control uh yeah control

02:44:01.359 --> 02:44:07.040
Caption: k is there okay you is uncommon control

02:44:04.319 --> 02:44:08.640
Caption: k c is to comment um but there we go so

02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:10.879
Caption: i&#39;ve turned on some editor rules um and

02:44:08.639 --> 02:44:12.559
Caption: so you can see these uh lines there or

02:44:10.879 --> 02:44:14.639
Caption: you can maybe make it a bit like get

02:44:12.559 --> 02:44:16.159
Caption: that real retro experience and just have

02:44:14.639 --> 02:44:17.599
Caption: a whole heap of scan lines across the

02:44:16.160 --> 02:44:19.520
Caption: screen

02:44:17.599 --> 02:44:20.959
Caption: i mean you then customize the colors for

02:44:19.519 --> 02:44:22.719
Caption: the minute and it can be useful it&#39;s

02:44:20.959 --> 02:44:24.478
Caption: like oh well we want to keep to it like

02:44:22.719 --> 02:44:26.160
Caption: an 80 character width because you know

02:44:24.478 --> 02:44:27.519
Caption: we know that there&#39;s someone on our team

02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:30.240
Caption: that

02:44:27.519 --> 02:44:31.839
Caption: that&#39;s kind of the the width of

02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:33.919
Caption: code that they can show at any point in

02:44:31.839 --> 02:44:35.679
Caption: time so we just want to be mindful of

02:44:33.919 --> 02:44:37.599
Caption: that so we you know we have an indicator

02:44:35.679 --> 02:44:39.040
Caption: in there or you know you&#39;re you&#39;re

02:44:37.599 --> 02:44:40.398
Caption: working on something that&#39;s got to be

02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:42.399
Caption: shipped to a mainframe and it is

02:44:40.399 --> 02:44:43.279
Caption: actually like an 80 character width uh

02:44:42.399 --> 02:44:44.720
Caption: terminal that they&#39;re going to be

02:44:43.279 --> 02:44:46.640
Caption: working with so so you want to know

02:44:44.719 --> 02:44:48.478
Caption: where 80 characters is or you&#39;re one of

02:44:46.639 --> 02:44:50.398
Caption: those people that is militant about no

02:44:48.478 --> 02:44:53.119
Caption: it doesn&#39;t matter that we can have a

02:44:50.399 --> 02:44:54.640
Caption: curved 49-inch monitor around us i am

02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:56.160
Caption: going to have a fixed width of 80

02:44:54.639 --> 02:44:58.478
Caption: characters in my text editor because

02:44:56.160 --> 02:45:00.879
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s what i grew up with uh

02:44:58.478 --> 02:45:02.398
Caption: coding um but yeah it&#39;s just like it&#39;s

02:45:00.879 --> 02:45:04.000
Caption: it&#39;s kind of one of those random little

02:45:02.399 --> 02:45:05.760
Caption: features that i think

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:08.399
Caption: um can be useful particularly when

02:45:05.759 --> 02:45:10.160
Caption: you&#39;re uh considering

02:45:08.399 --> 02:45:13.120
Caption: uh how other people

02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:14.959
Caption: are also going to be working on um

02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:16.319
Caption: by a code base or or something like that

02:45:14.959 --> 02:45:17.200
Caption: for you um but we&#39;ll turn them off

02:45:16.319 --> 02:45:18.879
Caption: because they might be a little bit

02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:21.120
Caption: distracting

02:45:18.879 --> 02:45:23.279
Caption: uh another kind of actually i should

02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:26.000
Caption: have kept that open ctrl shift t

02:45:23.279 --> 02:45:29.600
Caption: open the last file

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:31.279
Caption: another thing that uh is um

02:45:29.599 --> 02:45:33.759
Caption: is is useful and

02:45:31.279 --> 02:45:35.760
Caption: uh i tend to forget to to turn it on

02:45:33.759 --> 02:45:37.919
Caption: because i i add it for like the demos

02:45:35.759 --> 02:45:38.559
Caption: that i do then i take it out because um

02:45:37.919 --> 02:45:40.719
Caption: i

02:45:38.559 --> 02:45:41.839
Caption: don&#39;t try to clean up my uh my workspace

02:45:40.719 --> 02:45:44.239
Caption: beforehand and then forget to have it

02:45:41.839 --> 02:45:46.639
Caption: put it back in uh they&#39;re called code

02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:49.600
Caption: actions on save so you want to perform

02:45:46.639 --> 02:45:50.719
Caption: something when uh when the file is being

02:45:49.599 --> 02:45:52.959
Caption: saved

02:45:50.719 --> 02:45:55.599
Caption: that&#39;s what code action&#39;s on save code

02:45:52.959 --> 02:45:57.679
Caption: action on save

02:45:55.599 --> 02:45:59.358
Caption: and

02:45:57.679 --> 02:46:01.679
Caption: we can get it to do a variety of

02:45:59.359 --> 02:46:04.160
Caption: different things so what

02:46:01.679 --> 02:46:05.278
Caption: control space one of those is organize

02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:07.439
Caption: imports

02:46:05.279 --> 02:46:09.120
Caption: so we&#39;re going to hit set that to true

02:46:07.439 --> 02:46:11.359
Caption: so let&#39;s say that we&#39;re working on like

02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:14.799
Caption: a javascript file

02:46:11.359 --> 02:46:16.880
Caption: one here uh and we&#39;ve got a like a

02:46:14.799 --> 02:46:18.160
Caption: a linkedin rule where we have to we want

02:46:16.879 --> 02:46:19.839
Caption: to keep the order of our imports in an

02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:22.319
Caption: alphabetical banner that&#39;s a it&#39;s a

02:46:19.839 --> 02:46:24.559
Caption: fairly common olympic rule well i i&#39;ve

02:46:22.319 --> 02:46:26.160
Caption: got them a bit uh backwards here um

02:46:24.559 --> 02:46:27.438
Caption: because i want the distractor imports at

02:46:26.160 --> 02:46:30.120
Caption: the very top

02:46:27.439 --> 02:46:32.399
Caption: so i can go ctrl shift p and then uh

02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:35.279
Caption: organize imports

02:46:32.399 --> 02:46:36.720
Caption: or shift alt o is the default shortcut

02:46:35.279 --> 02:46:37.919
Caption: key for that one

02:46:36.719 --> 02:46:40.959
Caption: i can hit it and it&#39;s going to do that

02:46:37.919 --> 02:46:42.879
Caption: for me or with code actions on save

02:46:40.959 --> 02:46:44.080
Caption: now as soon as i hit ctrl s to save the

02:46:42.879 --> 02:46:45.519
Caption: file

02:46:44.080 --> 02:46:47.919
Caption: it&#39;s going to just run that for me you

02:46:45.519 --> 02:46:49.039
Caption: know it just like it&#39;s a useful little

02:46:47.919 --> 02:46:50.240
Caption: thing particularly if like those are the

02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:52.160
Caption: sorts of things that you&#39;re putting in

02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:53.759
Caption: your like your lending rules um there&#39;s

02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:56.719
Caption: also another one in there for uh for fix

02:46:53.759 --> 02:46:58.318
Caption: all um so it&#39;ll uh if you&#39;ve got a like

02:46:56.719 --> 02:47:00.799
Caption: a linter installed that is going to be

02:46:58.319 --> 02:47:03.439
Caption: applying um fixing rules uh it can try

02:47:00.799 --> 02:47:05.438
Caption: and run those for you so like eslimps um

02:47:03.439 --> 02:47:08.319
Caption: it&#39;ll try and apply those fixes to the

02:47:05.439 --> 02:47:10.399
Caption: file as you hit save so yeah just like

02:47:08.319 --> 02:47:12.720
Caption: little quality of life improvements that

02:47:10.399 --> 02:47:12.720
Caption: are there

02:47:13.759 --> 02:47:17.278
Caption: let&#39;s come back um

02:47:17.839 --> 02:47:23.200
Caption: oh uh the last one from a setting

02:47:20.639 --> 02:47:26.559
Caption: standpoint that could be useful is this

02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:28.879
Caption: default editor language um

02:47:26.559 --> 02:47:32.079
Caption: what it will do is it will attempt to

02:47:28.879 --> 02:47:34.319
Caption: work out from the workspace

02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:36.399
Caption: what is the most common programming

02:47:34.319 --> 02:47:38.240
Caption: language of the files that are in there

02:47:36.399 --> 02:47:40.560
Caption: and when you do control n to create a

02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:42.319
Caption: new file it will assign that language

02:47:40.559 --> 02:47:44.000
Caption: service to the new file so you

02:47:42.319 --> 02:47:46.080
Caption: immediately get your

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Caption: code completion turned on for the file

02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:49.279
Caption: you immediately get the correct color

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:51.679
Caption: like syntax highlighting and

02:47:49.279 --> 02:47:53.279
Caption: colorizations and stuff like that um but

02:47:51.679 --> 02:47:55.679
Caption: you can actually override that setting

02:47:53.279 --> 02:47:58.319
Caption: uh so yeah no i want new files in this

02:47:55.679 --> 02:48:00.639
Caption: repo to be always defaulted to mark now

02:47:58.319 --> 02:48:02.560
Caption: for example i do that for my

02:48:00.639 --> 02:48:04.159
Caption: my blog is rendering markdown so i

02:48:02.559 --> 02:48:06.000
Caption: default the files to always be marked

02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:08.879
Caption: down unless i change the

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:11.919
Caption: the the file with control k m

02:48:08.879 --> 02:48:13.599
Caption: ctrl k m not control k control n control

02:48:11.919 --> 02:48:15.759
Caption: k m and that&#39;s how we can change the

02:48:13.599 --> 02:48:17.919
Caption: language of a file um

02:48:15.759 --> 02:48:19.519
Caption: so yeah but you can you can set you can

02:48:17.919 --> 02:48:20.799
Caption: let vs code attempt to figure out what

02:48:19.519 --> 02:48:22.959
Caption: should be the default language for a new

02:48:20.799 --> 02:48:24.160
Caption: file or you can force that uh with

02:48:22.959 --> 02:48:26.799
Caption: settings

02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:30.000
Caption: um active active editor language is the

02:48:26.799 --> 02:48:32.240
Caption: default that&#39;s there

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.240
Caption: right

02:48:32.559 --> 02:48:36.159
Caption: we&#39;ll come back to slides for a minute

02:48:36.959 --> 02:48:42.879
Caption: because i want to talk about extensions

02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:45.839
Caption: vs code has a huge amount of

02:48:42.879 --> 02:48:47.358
Caption: extensibility um and

02:48:45.839 --> 02:48:49.599
Caption: out of that has grown a massive

02:48:47.359 --> 02:48:51.279
Caption: extensions ecosystem everyone&#39;s going to

02:48:49.599 --> 02:48:52.959
Caption: have their favorite extension that you

02:48:51.279 --> 02:48:54.959
Caption: should have installed

02:48:52.959 --> 02:48:57.120
Caption: that they believe is the it&#39;s going to

02:48:54.959 --> 02:48:59.040
Caption: change the way that you use vs code

02:48:57.120 --> 02:49:00.479
Caption: and there are literally thousands of

02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:01.599
Caption: extensions so i am not going to cover

02:49:00.478 --> 02:49:03.679
Caption: them all off in here i&#39;m just going to

02:49:01.599 --> 02:49:05.519
Caption: talk about a couple that i think

02:49:03.679 --> 02:49:08.398
Caption: are really useful and that i&#39;ve got

02:49:05.519 --> 02:49:11.039
Caption: installed on my machine um and they&#39;re

02:49:08.399 --> 02:49:12.880
Caption: generic ones they&#39;re not um

02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:14.799
Caption: they&#39;re not specific to a particular

02:49:12.879 --> 02:49:17.200
Caption: programming language or anything like

02:49:14.799 --> 02:49:20.160
Caption: that so these are these are six um top

02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:22.319
Caption: ones for me um editor config for vs code

02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:24.959
Caption: so editor config if you&#39;re unfamiliar

02:49:22.319 --> 02:49:28.399
Caption: with it is a file that you can put into

02:49:24.959 --> 02:49:29.438
Caption: a repo that we&#39;re that you use to define

02:49:28.399 --> 02:49:31.920
Caption: the

02:49:29.439 --> 02:49:33.600
Caption: set default things about a file like

02:49:31.919 --> 02:49:36.000
Caption: what is the default line encoding how

02:49:33.599 --> 02:49:38.318
Caption: many are we using tabs or spaces now

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:41.040
Caption: what&#39;s the default indentation depth and

02:49:38.319 --> 02:49:42.399
Caption: you can then set that for um uh like

02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:45.120
Caption: different for different files so maybe

02:49:42.399 --> 02:49:46.880
Caption: your your your bash files um they need

02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:49.120
Caption: to have an lf as the default line

02:49:46.879 --> 02:49:51.040
Caption: encoding whereas other files you might

02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:53.600
Caption: want to have a crlf as the the line

02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:55.120
Caption: encoding and then you can and so that

02:49:53.599 --> 02:49:56.639
Caption: that one&#39;s a useful one just to enforce

02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:57.759
Caption: standardization with inside of a code

02:49:56.639 --> 02:49:58.559
Caption: base

02:49:57.759 --> 02:50:00.559
Caption: uh

02:49:58.559 --> 02:50:02.639
Caption: get up pull requests and issues uh just

02:50:00.559 --> 02:50:04.000
Caption: manage all your github stuff uh what

02:50:02.639 --> 02:50:06.318
Caption: pull requests and issues aspects of

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:08.160
Caption: github from within vs code don&#39;t have to

02:50:06.319 --> 02:50:11.359
Caption: jump out to the website don&#39;t have to

02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:11.359
Caption: jump out to the the github

02:50:11.439 --> 02:50:15.680
Caption: desktop application or anything like

02:50:12.719 --> 02:50:17.278
Caption: that um just do it from vs code um rest

02:50:15.679 --> 02:50:20.879
Caption: client if you&#39;re doing anything that

02:50:17.279 --> 02:50:23.200
Caption: involves calling apis rest client is

02:50:20.879 --> 02:50:24.799
Caption: so useful um it&#39;s the same as like

02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:26.319
Caption: postman and insomniac and all those

02:50:24.799 --> 02:50:29.358
Caption: sorts of tools so it allows you to

02:50:26.319 --> 02:50:31.680
Caption: invoke http um requests

02:50:29.359 --> 02:50:34.080
Caption: but the advantage of rest client is that

02:50:31.679 --> 02:50:35.759
Caption: you create a file um and then

02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:38.479
Caption: you just execute the things out of that

02:50:35.759 --> 02:50:40.559
Caption: file so you can have you know your

02:50:38.478 --> 02:50:41.839
Caption: examples of how to call an api as a file

02:50:40.559 --> 02:50:43.040
Caption: then you just check in part of your git

02:50:41.839 --> 02:50:45.040
Caption: repo

02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:46.799
Caption: and then you like it&#39;s it&#39;s all there

02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:48.479
Caption: it&#39;s all in one location and you can

02:50:46.799 --> 02:50:51.120
Caption: then execute those from within sort of

02:50:48.478 --> 02:50:52.318
Caption: vs code uh peacock this was actually

02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:55.359
Caption: written by a colleague of mine at

02:50:52.319 --> 02:50:57.359
Caption: microsoft uh and it&#39;s it&#39;s what a uh

02:50:55.359 --> 02:51:00.560
Caption: what it does is it changes the colors of

02:50:57.359 --> 02:51:03.760
Caption: like the borders of vs code so you

02:51:00.559 --> 02:51:05.040
Caption: would have seen uh the one that i had uh

02:51:03.759 --> 02:51:07.599
Caption: where is it

02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:09.359
Caption: it&#39;s my lovely background

02:51:07.599 --> 02:51:11.358
Caption: uh so see how this has got the green

02:51:09.359 --> 02:51:12.880
Caption: around it uh peacock&#39;s done that so if

02:51:11.359 --> 02:51:15.040
Caption: you&#39;ve got a couple of vs code instances

02:51:12.879 --> 02:51:16.240
Caption: open maybe you want to um you set

02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:18.639
Caption: different colors on them so you know

02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:22.319
Caption: which one it is as you&#39;re all tabbing um

02:51:18.639 --> 02:51:23.199
Caption: between your uh between your windows

02:51:22.319 --> 02:51:25.040
Caption: uh

02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:27.839
Caption: code spell checker

02:51:25.040 --> 02:51:30.160
Caption: funny story was uh when i was working

02:51:27.839 --> 02:51:31.200
Caption: for a company a number of years ago we

02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:33.200
Caption: were

02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:35.040
Caption: we were building a custom crm and we

02:51:33.200 --> 02:51:36.479
Caption: needed to keep track of uh person name

02:51:35.040 --> 02:51:38.160
Caption: history uh

02:51:36.478 --> 02:51:39.679
Caption: because if someone changed their name we

02:51:38.160 --> 02:51:42.560
Caption: needed to track that so we created a

02:51:39.679 --> 02:51:43.759
Caption: table called person name history

02:51:42.559 --> 02:51:44.879
Caption: well so we thought that&#39;s what we named

02:51:43.759 --> 02:51:46.318
Caption: the table

02:51:44.879 --> 02:51:47.279
Caption: it wasn&#39;t until several months later

02:51:46.319 --> 02:51:50.879
Caption: that we realized that we&#39;d actually

02:51:47.279 --> 02:51:52.479
Caption: named the table person named his troy

02:51:50.879 --> 02:51:54.080
Caption: we&#39;d also written custom orm it had

02:51:52.478 --> 02:51:55.839
Caption: generated a whole bunch of c sharp code

02:51:54.080 --> 02:51:58.240
Caption: from the database so we had all these

02:51:55.839 --> 02:52:00.000
Caption: classes called person name his troy

02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:02.399
Caption: uh you would get back person

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:04.399
Caption: collection a person named his troyes uh

02:52:02.399 --> 02:52:05.520
Caption: and all that kind of stuff um

02:52:04.399 --> 02:52:07.359
Caption: it was then

02:52:05.519 --> 02:52:08.559
Caption: like this was then in in testing and it

02:52:07.359 --> 02:52:09.760
Caption: was just it was too hard to go back and

02:52:08.559 --> 02:52:11.040
Caption: fix it so we&#39;re like oh well we&#39;re

02:52:09.759 --> 02:52:13.599
Caption: shipping to production with person name

02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:13.599
Caption: his choice

02:52:13.679 --> 02:52:17.278
Caption: you want an extension like this one like

02:52:15.519 --> 02:52:19.199
Caption: code spell check to

02:52:17.279 --> 02:52:22.240
Caption: make sure you don&#39;t do that

02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:24.000
Caption: um i i and i&#39;m just horrendously bad at

02:52:22.240 --> 02:52:25.600
Caption: spelling it at the best of times so i

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:27.679
Caption: use that on my blog and it just like

02:52:25.599 --> 02:52:29.839
Caption: it&#39;s just so nice and uh that i could

02:52:27.679 --> 02:52:31.438
Caption: just not have to worry about that

02:52:29.839 --> 02:52:32.398
Caption: uh and then the last one is to do

02:52:31.439 --> 02:52:34.240
Caption: highlight

02:52:32.399 --> 02:52:36.880
Caption: so to do highlight actually like to use

02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:38.799
Caption: with uh the github uh one so where you

02:52:36.879 --> 02:52:40.719
Caption: put like whack i&#39;ll like put a comment

02:52:38.799 --> 02:52:43.519
Caption: in you know to do i&#39;m totally gonna fix

02:52:40.719 --> 02:52:45.438
Caption: this code later i can and you totally

02:52:43.519 --> 02:52:47.119
Caption: got to come back and do that right um

02:52:45.439 --> 02:52:48.800
Caption: what what to do highlight will do is it

02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:50.639
Caption: will actually find all those and give

02:52:48.799 --> 02:52:51.919
Caption: you a list of that like you can see that

02:52:50.639 --> 02:52:53.120
Caption: with inside of vs code like here&#39;s all

02:52:51.919 --> 02:52:54.160
Caption: the tools you&#39;ve got with inside of the

02:52:53.120 --> 02:52:55.919
Caption: solution

02:52:54.160 --> 02:52:58.319
Caption: but then i combine that with the github

02:52:55.919 --> 02:53:00.240
Caption: full request and issues uh so that you

02:52:58.319 --> 02:53:02.160
Caption: can just select that to do uh and then

02:53:00.240 --> 02:53:04.160
Caption: immediately create a github issue out of

02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:05.279
Caption: that so that it&#39;s not just in the code

02:53:04.160 --> 02:53:06.879
Caption: base that you&#39;re totally gonna fix it

02:53:05.279 --> 02:53:07.919
Caption: later it&#39;s also in your github issues

02:53:06.879 --> 02:53:08.959
Caption: that you&#39;re totally gonna come back and

02:53:07.919 --> 02:53:10.559
Caption: fix

02:53:08.959 --> 02:53:12.000
Caption: and it just gets de-prioritized down the

02:53:10.559 --> 02:53:14.318
Caption: back

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:16.000
Caption: um yeah uh

02:53:14.319 --> 02:53:17.439
Caption: these sticks are like yeah they&#39;re ones

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.799
Caption: that i find really useful and like i

02:53:17.439 --> 02:53:19.920
Caption: said these aren&#39;t specific to any kind

02:53:18.799 --> 02:53:22.719
Caption: of programming like whether you&#39;re

02:53:19.919 --> 02:53:25.839
Caption: writing markdown or python or net or

02:53:22.719 --> 02:53:28.080
Caption: whatever these can all help out there

02:53:25.839 --> 02:53:30.160
Caption: but i&#39;m a web developer at heart so i

02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:33.359
Caption: want to talk about a couple of um my

02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:35.919
Caption: favorite uh web developer or javascript

02:53:33.359 --> 02:53:38.560
Caption: developer extensions um

02:53:35.919 --> 02:53:41.040
Caption: and i linked my animations are not quite

02:53:38.559 --> 02:53:43.839
Caption: right uh so um

02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:46.559
Caption: prettier so uh if you&#39;re if you&#39;re doing

02:53:43.839 --> 02:53:48.000
Caption: javascript uh projects prettier is kind

02:53:46.559 --> 02:53:50.239
Caption: of like it&#39;s the de facto standard i

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Caption: think at the moment for doing um code

02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:53.520
Caption: formatting uh for javascript

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:55.599
Caption: applications it also does like html and

02:53:53.519 --> 02:53:57.519
Caption: css and i think a couple other languages

02:53:55.599 --> 02:53:59.759
Caption: markdown and stuff like that uh there is

02:53:57.519 --> 02:54:02.559
Caption: an extension for vs code so that uh like

02:53:59.759 --> 02:54:04.879
Caption: you don&#39;t have to um do anything it just

02:54:02.559 --> 02:54:07.438
Caption: uh it includes it and then it you can

02:54:04.879 --> 02:54:09.358
Caption: set that as the default format formatter

02:54:07.439 --> 02:54:11.840
Caption: for fi for the right files are your

02:54:09.359 --> 02:54:13.359
Caption: javascript files so when you um in vs

02:54:11.839 --> 02:54:15.120
Caption: code you tell it to format the file it

02:54:13.359 --> 02:54:16.880
Caption: will execute prettier for you

02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:18.479
Caption: um combine that with eslint so then you

02:54:16.879 --> 02:54:20.719
Caption: can get your linting

02:54:18.478 --> 02:54:22.159
Caption: rules uh the the linking information

02:54:20.719 --> 02:54:23.200
Caption: surfaced up with inside of the editor so

02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:24.879
Caption: you can quickly jump around and find

02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:26.799
Caption: those without having to wait until the

02:54:24.879 --> 02:54:29.438
Caption: ci build has failed because you didn&#39;t

02:54:26.799 --> 02:54:30.559
Caption: run uh npm no you didn&#39;t run your lintel

02:54:29.439 --> 02:54:33.439
Caption: before pushing

02:54:30.559 --> 02:54:35.438
Caption: uh npm um this is a just a useful

02:54:33.439 --> 02:54:37.200
Caption: extension uh for working with npm it

02:54:35.439 --> 02:54:40.160
Caption: will like when you&#39;re working a package

02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:41.680
Caption: json file uh you can do control space uh

02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:43.439
Caption: on the version and we&#39;ll show you the

02:54:41.679 --> 02:54:45.519
Caption: the version um

02:54:43.439 --> 02:54:48.960
Caption: versions available for that package and

02:54:45.519 --> 02:54:50.799
Caption: also give you like the december um

02:54:48.959 --> 02:54:54.160
Caption: syntax for it so like do you want the

02:54:50.799 --> 02:54:56.000
Caption: the the hat or do you want a

02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:57.600
Caption: star or whatever the case may be um so

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:59.040
Caption: yeah you can uh

02:54:57.599 --> 02:55:01.839
Caption: make sure you&#39;re locking packages at the

02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:04.479
Caption: right point uh and the last one is um uh

02:55:01.839 --> 02:55:07.040
Caption: we we shipped uh for vs code a bunch of

02:55:04.478 --> 02:55:10.478
Caption: extent an extension for uh edge so that

02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:12.559
Caption: you can do um like work with the browser

02:55:10.478 --> 02:55:14.079
Caption: from vs code and i&#39;m gonna have a crack

02:55:12.559 --> 02:55:16.000
Caption: at actually testing that one out now

02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:19.200
Caption: because i totally didn&#39;t just try and do

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:21.439
Caption: this before okay before i came to uh

02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:23.439
Caption: into the room for the session i totally

02:55:21.439 --> 02:55:25.439
Caption: this was all pre-planned and done um

02:55:23.439 --> 02:55:29.359
Caption: this is the dna perth website

02:55:25.439 --> 02:55:30.720
Caption: i put it down um let&#39;s do npm start

02:55:29.359 --> 02:55:32.880
Caption: and we&#39;ll see

02:55:30.719 --> 02:55:34.719
Caption: if that works there we go

02:55:32.879 --> 02:55:36.478
Caption: um and i do have the edge extension

02:55:34.719 --> 02:55:39.200
Caption: installed so the edge extension i think

02:55:36.478 --> 02:55:41.599
Caption: it also works with chrome to a degree so

02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:42.560
Caption: because it&#39;s chromium browsers

02:55:41.599 --> 02:55:44.559
Caption: but

02:55:42.559 --> 02:55:47.438
Caption: this is

02:55:44.559 --> 02:55:49.669
Caption: not working fantastic

02:55:47.439 --> 02:55:50.880
Caption: all right um well the

02:55:49.669 --> 02:55:53.040
Caption: [Music]

02:55:50.879 --> 02:55:55.519
Caption: oh i had to do like npm build i think

02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:57.040
Caption: npm run build

02:55:55.519 --> 02:55:58.398
Caption: i totally didn&#39;t read that readme either

02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:00.240
Caption: so i was just like i can clone this run

02:55:58.399 --> 02:56:01.600
Caption: npm install and yeah like everything

02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:03.200
Caption: will be fine

02:56:01.599 --> 02:56:05.119
Caption: yeah yeah

02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:07.200
Caption: that might not be fine that&#39;s gonna take

02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:09.520
Caption: a while um uh

02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:13.359
Caption: let&#39;s try uh i&#39;ll show i&#39;ll show us um a

02:56:09.519 --> 02:56:14.559
Caption: slightly different uh one of it uh that

02:56:13.359 --> 02:56:16.720
Caption: does work

02:56:14.559 --> 02:56:19.599
Caption: but not quite as much as i wanted there

02:56:16.719 --> 02:56:21.200
Caption: uh so oh another one from there task and

02:56:19.599 --> 02:56:22.959
Caption: then these are uh scripts that i&#39;ve

02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:25.200
Caption: already got inside of my repo that i can

02:56:22.959 --> 02:56:26.160
Caption: run uh this is my this is my blog i&#39;m

02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:28.879
Caption: just going to

02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:31.200
Caption: run the the little web server for that

02:56:28.879 --> 02:56:32.639
Caption: it&#39;s open and now i&#39;m going to use the

02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:33.839
Caption: edge extension which i&#39;ve got installed

02:56:32.639 --> 02:56:35.519
Caption: here

02:56:33.839 --> 02:56:36.959
Caption: and there it is

02:56:35.519 --> 02:56:38.839
Caption: i have my website there and i want to

02:56:36.959 --> 02:56:41.599
Caption: hit

02:56:38.839 --> 02:56:43.120
Caption: open there we go

02:56:41.599 --> 02:56:46.080
Caption: i do apologize that it is going to be

02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:48.000
Caption: very cramped because it&#39;s all zoomed in

02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:49.839
Caption: for the editor but

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.839
Caption: there&#39;s my there&#39;s my website on one

02:56:49.839 --> 02:56:56.160
Caption: side and there&#39;s a dom inspector on the

02:56:51.839 --> 02:56:57.358
Caption: other side so i could go hey let&#39;s find

02:56:56.160 --> 02:56:59.839
Caption: that element

02:56:57.359 --> 02:57:01.359
Caption: so i can like i can ins like

02:56:59.839 --> 02:57:04.478
Caption: all that dom inspectory goodness that&#39;s

02:57:01.359 --> 02:57:06.479
Caption: there i have the the css um information

02:57:04.478 --> 02:57:07.839
Caption: there uh you probably can&#39;t read that

02:57:06.478 --> 02:57:09.919
Caption: unless you&#39;re in the front few rows but

02:57:07.839 --> 02:57:12.318
Caption: uh i&#39;m actually using sas

02:57:09.919 --> 02:57:14.319
Caption: to instead of like raw css so i&#39;m

02:57:12.319 --> 02:57:17.439
Caption: compiling that down to css and that&#39;s

02:57:14.319 --> 02:57:19.600
Caption: telling me this is uh banner.scss file

02:57:17.439 --> 02:57:20.840
Caption: um and

02:57:19.599 --> 02:57:23.040
Caption: if i

02:57:20.839 --> 02:57:24.080
Caption: wasn&#39;t using it in the way that i&#39;m

02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:25.359
Caption: using it i could actually click through

02:57:24.080 --> 02:57:27.040
Caption: to that file and we&#39;ll go to the file

02:57:25.359 --> 02:57:28.880
Caption: and disk unfortunately it&#39;s not working

02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:30.160
Caption: in this particular vs code instance

02:57:28.879 --> 02:57:33.519
Caption: because i&#39;m

02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:35.120
Caption: connected to a remote machine uh and it

02:57:33.519 --> 02:57:37.278
Caption: doesn&#39;t like so it can&#39;t access the file

02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:38.399
Caption: system uh properly to do that password

02:57:37.279 --> 02:57:40.160
Caption: that&#39;s why i was trying to get this one

02:57:38.399 --> 02:57:41.040
Caption: up and running and it&#39;s a good idea i

02:57:40.160 --> 02:57:43.439
Caption: didn&#39;t wait for that because it&#39;s still

02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:45.279
Caption: building um but like if if you&#39;re

02:57:43.439 --> 02:57:46.800
Caption: working with it just like directly on

02:57:45.279 --> 02:57:49.600
Caption: your mac or windows machine or linux

02:57:46.799 --> 02:57:51.599
Caption: machine then um like like you can click

02:57:49.599 --> 02:57:54.080
Caption: through to that file if you edit in the

02:57:51.599 --> 02:57:56.318
Caption: styles editor with inside of um this

02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:59.040
Caption: extension here it will actually push

02:57:56.319 --> 02:58:00.879
Caption: those to the file on disk um so like

02:57:59.040 --> 02:58:02.319
Caption: just like full real-time uh feedback

02:58:00.879 --> 02:58:04.719
Caption: loop that you get there

02:58:02.319 --> 02:58:05.919
Caption: yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a really nifty

02:58:04.719 --> 02:58:07.358
Caption: extension and i&#39;m not just trying to

02:58:05.919 --> 02:58:08.559
Caption: pimp it because i work for microsoft and

02:58:07.359 --> 02:58:10.880
Caption: i think edge is actually a decent

02:58:08.559 --> 02:58:13.119
Caption: browser um like being able to like have

02:58:10.879 --> 02:58:16.000
Caption: like having everything contextually in

02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:16.839
Caption: the one location i find is quite useful

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:19.679
Caption: all

02:58:16.839 --> 02:58:21.679
Caption: right now

02:58:19.679 --> 02:58:24.160
Caption: i did consulting work for nearly a

02:58:21.679 --> 02:58:26.318
Caption: decade before joining microsoft and

02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:28.799
Caption: something that was always frustrating

02:58:26.319 --> 02:58:31.040
Caption: when i was doing my consulting work was

02:58:28.799 --> 02:58:34.160
Caption: that i would come to a new client

02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:35.919
Caption: and like cool um welcome um here&#39;s your

02:58:34.160 --> 02:58:38.160
Caption: machine

02:58:35.919 --> 02:58:39.919
Caption: boom big pile of paper uh that&#39;s the

02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:41.839
Caption: setup guide for your machine we&#39;ll see

02:58:39.919 --> 02:58:43.438
Caption: you at the end of the week who&#39;s who&#39;s

02:58:41.839 --> 02:58:45.358
Caption: experienced something like that i&#39;ve

02:58:43.439 --> 02:58:47.920
Caption: seen i&#39;ve seen a lot of heads nod yeah

02:58:45.359 --> 02:58:49.600
Caption: it and you&#39;re just like

02:58:47.919 --> 02:58:52.478
Caption: i feel bad because like i know how much

02:58:49.599 --> 02:58:53.519
Caption: i&#39;m billing for you to be here and

02:58:52.478 --> 02:58:55.278
Caption: you&#39;re telling me it&#39;s going to take me

02:58:53.519 --> 02:58:57.119
Caption: a week before i can be productive

02:58:55.279 --> 02:58:58.399
Caption: because i&#39;ve got to you know like and

02:58:57.120 --> 02:59:00.719
Caption: you go through it and then it doesn&#39;t

02:58:58.399 --> 02:59:03.200
Caption: work anyway oh yeah sorry it turns out

02:59:00.719 --> 02:59:05.278
Caption: that um no we&#39;re actually using the the

02:59:03.200 --> 02:59:06.719
Caption: the newer version of red sorry just not

02:59:05.279 --> 02:59:08.319
Caption: like not the old version that&#39;s listed

02:59:06.719 --> 02:59:10.879
Caption: in there can you actually download the

02:59:08.319 --> 02:59:13.919
Caption: new can you can you upgrade that or um

02:59:10.879 --> 02:59:15.120
Caption: oh yeah we we forgot to add this step or

02:59:13.919 --> 02:59:16.799
Caption: actually

02:59:15.120 --> 02:59:18.080
Caption: can you go talk to

02:59:16.799 --> 02:59:19.759
Caption: this person on the other side of the

02:59:18.080 --> 02:59:21.200
Caption: room because they&#39;re going to have to

02:59:19.759 --> 02:59:22.318
Caption: help you um because yeah we haven&#39;t

02:59:21.200 --> 02:59:24.240
Caption: documented some of the new stuff that

02:59:22.319 --> 02:59:25.279
Caption: they&#39;ve added to the uh the environment

02:59:24.240 --> 02:59:28.160
Caption: and

02:59:25.279 --> 02:59:30.640
Caption: it&#39;s just it&#39;s so frustrating um but

02:59:28.160 --> 02:59:32.000
Caption: with vs code um

02:59:30.639 --> 02:59:34.318
Caption: one of the one of the things we can do

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:35.759
Caption: with that is uh i mentioned before like

02:59:34.319 --> 02:59:37.040
Caption: editor config and things like that just

02:59:35.759 --> 02:59:38.639
Caption: to enforce them like code

02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:39.919
Caption: standardization but you can even do that

02:59:38.639 --> 02:59:41.438
Caption: to the point of like editor

02:59:39.919 --> 02:59:42.398
Caption: standardization

02:59:41.439 --> 02:59:45.520
Caption: where

02:59:42.399 --> 02:59:48.720
Caption: um where we can have inside of our dot

02:59:45.519 --> 02:59:50.000
Caption: vs code folder uh we can include things

02:59:48.719 --> 02:59:52.318
Caption: like

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:54.959
Caption: settings so settings that are specific

02:59:52.319 --> 02:59:56.959
Caption: for this repo so when you open this repo

02:59:54.959 --> 02:59:59.759
Caption: in vs code these settings are going to

02:59:56.959 --> 03:00:01.438
Caption: be applied so like if if you&#39;ve got

02:59:59.759 --> 03:00:03.358
Caption: like a you know

03:00:01.439 --> 03:00:05.120
Caption: default file extension you want to set

03:00:03.359 --> 03:00:06.160
Caption: you can set that just for this project

03:00:05.120 --> 03:00:08.319
Caption: so that you opened up you&#39;re not having

03:00:06.160 --> 03:00:09.439
Caption: to set this on a machine wide wide

03:00:08.319 --> 03:00:12.720
Caption: config

03:00:09.439 --> 03:00:14.640
Caption: um another one i don&#39;t have it in this

03:00:12.719 --> 03:00:18.080
Caption: one but i think i might have it in

03:00:14.639 --> 03:00:20.318
Caption: actually i&#39;ll have it in here maybe

03:00:18.080 --> 03:00:21.439
Caption: i have so many oh there&#39;s so many things

03:00:20.319 --> 03:00:25.200
Caption: open

03:00:21.439 --> 03:00:28.000
Caption: uh whoops let&#39;s collapse that now

03:00:25.200 --> 03:00:29.200
Caption: uh you can also include uh

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.160
Caption: i don&#39;t have extensions in this one

03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:32.240
Caption: either

03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:34.399
Caption: ah but i know where it was i did see one

03:00:32.240 --> 03:00:36.560
Caption: earlier

03:00:34.399 --> 03:00:38.399
Caption: inside of this vs code folder

03:00:36.559 --> 03:00:40.318
Caption: extensions so these are recommended

03:00:38.399 --> 03:00:42.800
Caption: extensions that you should have to work

03:00:40.319 --> 03:00:44.080
Caption: on this particular project so they&#39;re um

03:00:42.799 --> 03:00:45.759
Caption: they encourage you to install the chrome

03:00:44.080 --> 03:00:47.359
Caption: debugger which ironically is actually

03:00:45.759 --> 03:00:48.959
Caption: deprecated

03:00:47.359 --> 03:00:51.120
Caption: um they&#39;re recommending that you install

03:00:48.959 --> 03:00:53.120
Caption: editor config and printer and

03:00:51.120 --> 03:00:55.520
Caption: uh eslint so what will happen is when

03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:57.200
Caption: you open up this uh this folder in vs

03:00:55.519 --> 03:00:58.719
Caption: code if you don&#39;t have those extensions

03:00:57.200 --> 03:01:00.240
Caption: installed you&#39;ll get a notice saying

03:00:58.719 --> 03:01:01.679
Caption: there are recommended extensions would

03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:02.879
Caption: you like to install them

03:01:01.679 --> 03:01:04.799
Caption: so that way you can make sure that

03:01:02.879 --> 03:01:07.839
Caption: everyone&#39;s kind of got that same sort of

03:01:04.799 --> 03:01:07.839
Caption: development experience

03:01:08.319 --> 03:01:13.279
Caption: but

03:01:10.080 --> 03:01:13.279
Caption: let&#39;s go back into the slides

03:01:13.599 --> 03:01:16.959
Caption: in a moment there we go

03:01:15.519 --> 03:01:18.799
Caption: but there&#39;s another level we can take

03:01:16.959 --> 03:01:22.000
Caption: this to and that&#39;s with a feature of vs

03:01:18.799 --> 03:01:23.040
Caption: code uh called uh dev containers

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:26.080
Caption: so

03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:27.359
Caption: a dev container is a way to dockerize

03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:29.120
Caption: the development environment that you&#39;re

03:01:27.359 --> 03:01:31.520
Caption: working in or

03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:33.120
Caption: dockerize the

03:01:31.519 --> 03:01:35.438
Caption: yeah the thing that you&#39;re you&#39;re

03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:37.359
Caption: building with uh and

03:01:35.439 --> 03:01:38.960
Caption: then because it&#39;s in a your

03:01:37.359 --> 03:01:41.279
Caption: environment&#39;s in a docking container you

03:01:38.959 --> 03:01:43.200
Caption: can control what&#39;s there so you can

03:01:41.279 --> 03:01:45.520
Caption: pre-install like the correct version of

03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:47.439
Caption: node or net or go or whatever

03:01:45.519 --> 03:01:51.519
Caption: runtime you&#39;re working with you can

03:01:47.439 --> 03:01:53.040
Caption: pre-install like a database yeah um and

03:01:51.519 --> 03:01:55.039
Caption: i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna keep just dropping

03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:56.599
Caption: in and out of my slides

03:01:55.040 --> 03:01:59.520
Caption: uh so

03:01:56.599 --> 03:02:01.278
Caption: this project yep this one here so this

03:01:59.519 --> 03:02:02.959
Caption: is one of my open source projects it&#39;s a

03:02:01.279 --> 03:02:04.479
Caption: f sharp project if anyone wants to talk

03:02:02.959 --> 03:02:05.759
Caption: f sharp come see me i&#39;m like probably

03:02:04.478 --> 03:02:07.278
Caption: the only person here that actually cares

03:02:05.759 --> 03:02:10.318
Caption: about that but it&#39;s awesome and if

03:02:07.279 --> 03:02:12.080
Caption: you&#39;re a dotnet developer learn f sharp

03:02:10.319 --> 03:02:14.319
Caption: um but this is a project for working

03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:16.479
Caption: with uh cosmos db

03:02:14.319 --> 03:02:18.000
Caption: uh from f sharp but for local

03:02:16.478 --> 03:02:20.079
Caption: development well i don&#39;t have to spin up

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:21.919
Caption: an azure resource for for cosmos db or

03:02:20.080 --> 03:02:24.160
Caption: if someone wants to come along

03:02:21.919 --> 03:02:25.519
Caption: and contribute a fix to it or a feature

03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:27.040
Caption: or anything like that i don&#39;t want them

03:02:25.519 --> 03:02:29.519
Caption: to have to stand up an azure account

03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:31.439
Caption: stand up of a cosmos instance inside of

03:02:29.519 --> 03:02:34.559
Caption: there so i have a dev container that

03:02:31.439 --> 03:02:37.120
Caption: does that for you um this one is using

03:02:34.559 --> 03:02:38.079
Caption: docker compose so it has the environment

03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:39.919
Caption: that you&#39;re going to be actually

03:02:38.080 --> 03:02:41.359
Caption: developing with inside of so this will

03:02:39.919 --> 03:02:43.759
Caption: preinstall the net

03:02:41.359 --> 03:02:45.680
Caption: runtime for you the correct version

03:02:43.759 --> 03:02:47.759
Caption: because i&#39;m working on.net six um so

03:02:45.679 --> 03:02:50.639
Caption: that&#39;ll all be pre-installed for you

03:02:47.759 --> 03:02:53.519
Caption: plus um a few tools make uh for working

03:02:50.639 --> 03:02:55.199
Caption: with f sharp um but then i have a

03:02:53.519 --> 03:02:56.639
Caption: another docker container that started up

03:02:55.200 --> 03:03:00.640
Caption: next to it which is going to be the

03:02:56.639 --> 03:03:02.318
Caption: cosmos dvd emulator i then also so when

03:03:00.639 --> 03:03:03.438
Caption: i open nvs code it detects this dev

03:03:02.319 --> 03:03:05.040
Caption: container says hey do you want to run

03:03:03.439 --> 03:03:07.520
Caption: this as a dev container

03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:08.879
Caption: you do that it will start this all up

03:03:07.519 --> 03:03:12.318
Caption: um it will start up the the docker

03:03:08.879 --> 03:03:14.000
Caption: container side by side and now i i can

03:03:12.319 --> 03:03:16.240
Caption: do full local development and i haven&#39;t

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:19.519
Caption: had to install anything other than

03:03:16.240 --> 03:03:21.200
Caption: docker and vs code um and then if i when

03:03:19.519 --> 03:03:23.839
Caption: i&#39;m finished working on this delete the

03:03:21.200 --> 03:03:25.359
Caption: repo off my machine and i don&#39;t have to

03:03:23.839 --> 03:03:26.879
Caption: uninstall

03:03:25.359 --> 03:03:28.319
Caption: the cosmos emulator i don&#39;t have to when

03:03:26.879 --> 03:03:30.719
Caption: i saw the net framework or anything like

03:03:28.319 --> 03:03:32.240
Caption: that it&#39;s all isolated uh and what this

03:03:30.719 --> 03:03:34.239
Caption: means is that yeah like it&#39;s very easy

03:03:32.240 --> 03:03:36.799
Caption: to come across as like an open source

03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:39.439
Caption: contributor pick up a project clone it

03:03:36.799 --> 03:03:41.519
Caption: open it and have all this like all the

03:03:39.439 --> 03:03:42.800
Caption: environment ready to go you haven&#39;t had

03:03:41.519 --> 03:03:44.478
Caption: to read like a

03:03:42.799 --> 03:03:45.519
Caption: massive contributing guide or anything

03:03:44.478 --> 03:03:48.879
Caption: like that

03:03:45.519 --> 03:03:51.119
Caption: um the the next kind of power of this is

03:03:48.879 --> 03:03:52.959
Caption: that if you&#39;re working with github code

03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:54.799
Caption: spaces uh

03:03:52.959 --> 03:03:56.559
Caption: when you open it in code spaces it will

03:03:54.799 --> 03:03:57.759
Caption: detect the dev container and provision

03:03:56.559 --> 03:04:00.239
Caption: the code space

03:03:57.759 --> 03:04:02.478
Caption: through those specifications for you um

03:04:00.240 --> 03:04:04.399
Caption: the the github folks um over the the

03:04:02.478 --> 03:04:05.839
Caption: booth actually have this running uh with

03:04:04.399 --> 03:04:09.359
Caption: another project of mine where it is

03:04:05.839 --> 03:04:10.879
Caption: running a cosmos dba emulator and uh a

03:04:09.359 --> 03:04:12.319
Caption: docking container side by side inside of

03:04:10.879 --> 03:04:14.240
Caption: code spaces and they&#39;re running that

03:04:12.319 --> 03:04:16.240
Caption: from a raspberry pi so you&#39;re like doing

03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:19.040
Caption: full development with two running docker

03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:21.040
Caption: containers off a raspberry pi um but

03:04:19.040 --> 03:04:22.559
Caption: dev containers are really useful for

03:04:21.040 --> 03:04:26.000
Caption: doing um

03:04:22.559 --> 03:04:27.519
Caption: is yeah like this remote uh so this

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:29.839
Caption: pre-provisioned environment and it can

03:04:27.519 --> 03:04:32.159
Caption: save so much time you know having to you

03:04:29.839 --> 03:04:33.919
Caption: know install this

03:04:32.160 --> 03:04:35.679
Caption: keep these docs up to date this is the

03:04:33.919 --> 03:04:37.279
Caption: right version of whatever the dependency

03:04:35.679 --> 03:04:39.839
Caption: is that we need to install you have it

03:04:37.279 --> 03:04:42.800
Caption: all there um uh pre-built and combined

03:04:39.839 --> 03:04:42.799
Caption: into this one folder

03:04:42.959 --> 03:04:46.559
Caption: um all right

03:04:44.639 --> 03:04:47.679
Caption: we&#39;ve got about

03:04:46.559 --> 03:04:50.239
Caption: um i&#39;m gonna leave some time for

03:04:47.679 --> 03:04:52.398
Caption: questions at the end um so uh we&#39;ll go

03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:54.319
Caption: for about probably i think like 10

03:04:52.399 --> 03:04:55.359
Caption: minutes left i think

03:04:54.319 --> 03:04:57.040
Caption: yeah

03:04:55.359 --> 03:04:58.560
Caption: i&#39;m getting some vagueness on that i&#39;m

03:04:57.040 --> 03:05:01.679
Caption: also the thing that&#39;s standing between

03:04:58.559 --> 03:05:02.879
Caption: everyone and lunch so uh

03:05:01.679 --> 03:05:06.239
Caption: um

03:05:02.879 --> 03:05:08.080
Caption: i talked a bit about code spaces but

03:05:06.240 --> 03:05:11.200
Caption: there is

03:05:08.080 --> 03:05:13.200
Caption: one other thing that i will

03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:16.000
Caption: show off because i think it is super

03:05:13.200 --> 03:05:17.439
Caption: cool particularly in um

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:19.200
Caption: in the fact that a lot more of us are

03:05:17.439 --> 03:05:21.680
Caption: working from home now i&#39;ve got to find

03:05:19.200 --> 03:05:23.759
Caption: the right vs code instance that i have

03:05:21.679 --> 03:05:26.639
Caption: open

03:05:23.759 --> 03:05:28.478
Caption: where is it here here and

03:05:26.639 --> 03:05:30.839
Caption: i have so many vs codes where are all

03:05:28.478 --> 03:05:33.199
Caption: the vs codes it&#39;s not that

03:05:30.839 --> 03:05:35.358
Caption: one was it this one

03:05:33.200 --> 03:05:36.799
Caption: no no i don&#39;t have it on any of them um

03:05:35.359 --> 03:05:40.720
Caption: there&#39;s an extension that i&#39;m going to

03:05:36.799 --> 03:05:40.719
Caption: install called live share

03:05:41.519 --> 03:05:45.599
Caption: and this should actually install pretty

03:05:42.879 --> 03:05:48.478
Caption: quickly because i already have it done

03:05:45.599 --> 03:05:51.679
Caption: live share there we go okay so liveshare

03:05:48.478 --> 03:05:53.759
Caption: is a extension that uh

03:05:51.679 --> 03:05:55.759
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s a

03:05:53.759 --> 03:05:58.959
Caption: i guess you&#39;d call it a product um

03:05:55.759 --> 03:06:01.599
Caption: we created microsoft for uh

03:05:58.959 --> 03:06:04.319
Caption: doing um

03:06:01.599 --> 03:06:04.318
Caption: uh remote

03:06:04.399 --> 03:06:07.760
Caption: pair programming i guess it&#39;s probably a

03:06:06.160 --> 03:06:10.319
Caption: good way to do it a good way to describe

03:06:07.759 --> 03:06:12.318
Caption: it so with live share i&#39;m going to hit

03:06:10.319 --> 03:06:13.919
Caption: share now that i&#39;ve installed that

03:06:12.319 --> 03:06:17.200
Caption: and what it&#39;s going to do is it&#39;s going

03:06:13.919 --> 03:06:19.279
Caption: to start up a collaboration session from

03:06:17.200 --> 03:06:21.520
Caption: my machine and

03:06:19.279 --> 03:06:22.399
Caption: uh it&#39;s going to this is probably going

03:06:21.519 --> 03:06:24.159
Caption: to

03:06:22.399 --> 03:06:25.840
Caption: not go as fast as i would like it to go

03:06:24.160 --> 03:06:28.479
Caption: and that&#39;s going to be very depressing

03:06:25.839 --> 03:06:30.879
Caption: but by by doing this i can i&#39;ll then end

03:06:28.478 --> 03:06:32.639
Caption: up with a url that i can give out to you

03:06:30.879 --> 03:06:34.398
Caption: know someone that i might be pair

03:06:32.639 --> 03:06:37.199
Caption: programming with and they can connect

03:06:34.399 --> 03:06:39.520
Caption: from their machine uh to

03:06:37.200 --> 03:06:41.200
Caption: essentially by vs code instance

03:06:39.519 --> 03:06:42.318
Caption: but they don&#39;t actually have to have vs

03:06:41.200 --> 03:06:44.080
Caption: code installed they can do it directly

03:06:42.319 --> 03:06:45.439
Caption: from the browser uh they could open it

03:06:44.080 --> 03:06:47.919
Caption: up in full visual studio uh and

03:06:45.439 --> 03:06:51.359
Caption: liveshare actually works with um

03:06:47.919 --> 03:06:54.160
Caption: visual studio as well as vs code um

03:06:51.359 --> 03:06:57.840
Caption: let&#39;s hit share again ah there we go oh

03:06:54.160 --> 03:06:57.839
Caption: cool we&#39;re gonna do a sign-in dance

03:06:59.599 --> 03:07:03.599
Caption: everyone&#39;s going to learn my password to

03:07:01.120 --> 03:07:03.600
Caption: github

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:07.759
Caption: nope i should be already authenticated

03:07:05.759 --> 03:07:08.799
Caption: uh so it&#39;s done okay

03:07:07.759 --> 03:07:10.959
Caption: um

03:07:08.799 --> 03:07:12.160
Caption: it&#39;s collaboration session come on there

03:07:10.959 --> 03:07:13.519
Caption: we go okay so

03:07:12.160 --> 03:07:14.399
Caption: that is open

03:07:13.519 --> 03:07:16.318
Caption: uh

03:07:14.399 --> 03:07:17.760
Caption: we don&#39;t need that i want to grab the

03:07:16.319 --> 03:07:20.080
Caption: url

03:07:17.759 --> 03:07:22.879
Caption: when it starts

03:07:20.080 --> 03:07:25.279
Caption: here we go okay

03:07:22.879 --> 03:07:26.398
Caption: session details

03:07:25.279 --> 03:07:28.800
Caption: copy link

03:07:26.399 --> 03:07:31.200
Caption: excellent now

03:07:28.799 --> 03:07:33.438
Caption: i&#39;m going to paste this into the browser

03:07:31.200 --> 03:07:33.439
Caption: and

03:07:33.519 --> 03:07:36.559
Caption: it&#39;s going to start

03:07:34.879 --> 03:07:39.759
Caption: vs code in the browser

03:07:36.559 --> 03:07:41.679
Caption: so here we go

03:07:39.759 --> 03:07:43.120
Caption: uh and it&#39;s going to take a few minutes

03:07:41.679 --> 03:07:43.839
Caption: uh or hopefully not a few minutes it&#39;s

03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:46.000
Caption: going to take a little bit of time

03:07:43.839 --> 03:07:48.240
Caption: because what it&#39;s doing is it&#39;s talking

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:49.759
Caption: into my laptop which is actually going

03:07:48.240 --> 03:07:51.040
Caption: i&#39;m going to continue on the web which

03:07:49.759 --> 03:07:53.599
Caption: is going over the 5g connection on my

03:07:51.040 --> 03:07:56.399
Caption: phone continuous anonymous

03:07:53.599 --> 03:07:59.358
Caption: yeah we&#39;ll call that guest user uh and

03:07:56.399 --> 03:08:00.880
Caption: they are going to be able to uh see like

03:07:59.359 --> 03:08:01.680
Caption: all the files on my machine they&#39;re also

03:08:00.879 --> 03:08:03.839
Caption: going to be able to connect to the

03:08:01.679 --> 03:08:05.120
Caption: locally running web server that i&#39;ve got

03:08:03.839 --> 03:08:07.200
Caption: so they can

03:08:05.120 --> 03:08:08.399
Caption: view the the website well which happens

03:08:07.200 --> 03:08:10.160
Caption: to be my blog

03:08:08.399 --> 03:08:12.160
Caption: there we go so there&#39;s all the files

03:08:10.160 --> 03:08:13.600
Caption: starting to come in

03:08:12.160 --> 03:08:15.839
Caption: i can open up

03:08:13.599 --> 03:08:17.759
Caption: let&#39;s just pick a random file let&#39;s pick

03:08:15.839 --> 03:08:20.240
Caption: this package json

03:08:17.759 --> 03:08:22.240
Caption: it&#39;s going to have syntax highlighting

03:08:20.240 --> 03:08:24.319
Caption: and colorization

03:08:22.240 --> 03:08:26.240
Caption: and all that kind of stuff in there

03:08:24.319 --> 03:08:28.240
Caption: but then as the as the host of this

03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:30.319
Caption: collaboration session i can see here&#39;s

03:08:28.240 --> 03:08:34.839
Caption: guest user seven they&#39;re on that file in

03:08:30.319 --> 03:08:34.840
Caption: that line i can go follow participant

03:08:36.559 --> 03:08:42.239
Caption: let&#39;s just close off some of these okay

03:08:39.599 --> 03:08:44.318
Caption: that&#39;s it oh sorry focus participant no

03:08:42.240 --> 03:08:46.560
Caption: follow to the side

03:08:44.319 --> 03:08:49.120
Caption: and there we go i can see that&#39;s where

03:08:46.559 --> 03:08:51.679
Caption: guest user is now there&#39;s a little

03:08:49.120 --> 03:08:51.679
Caption: purple

03:08:51.919 --> 03:08:59.679
Caption: carrot here which is uh where they are

03:08:55.439 --> 03:09:00.479
Caption: put these side by side-ish

03:08:59.679 --> 03:09:04.080
Caption: and

03:09:00.478 --> 03:09:06.478
Caption: where let&#39;s go come on let&#39;s need more

03:09:04.080 --> 03:09:09.040
Caption: space on my screen

03:09:06.478 --> 03:09:10.879
Caption: so zoomed in uh okay and

03:09:09.040 --> 03:09:12.719
Caption: you can see as that guest user clicks

03:09:10.879 --> 03:09:15.519
Caption: around we can see what they&#39;re doing

03:09:12.719 --> 03:09:18.559
Caption: uh and then if i was to come into let&#39;s

03:09:15.519 --> 03:09:20.879
Caption: go into here i want to come into

03:09:18.559 --> 03:09:22.079
Caption: my graphql file

03:09:20.879 --> 03:09:23.519
Caption: here we go

03:09:22.080 --> 03:09:25.679
Caption: so i i can like

03:09:23.519 --> 03:09:27.759
Caption: remotely that person like i can see in

03:09:25.679 --> 03:09:30.559
Caption: real time what&#39;s happening um if i&#39;m

03:09:27.759 --> 03:09:32.639
Caption: making changes in one uh

03:09:30.559 --> 03:09:35.199
Caption: in one editor those will be reflected so

03:09:32.639 --> 03:09:36.639
Caption: uh if we yeah if if i was to do that

03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:38.879
Caption: like that those changes be reflected

03:09:36.639 --> 03:09:40.959
Caption: across i said they get full debugging um

03:09:38.879 --> 03:09:43.120
Caption: they can set breakpoints and all that

03:09:40.959 --> 03:09:45.679
Caption: sort of stuff um which is really useful

03:09:43.120 --> 03:09:47.839
Caption: if you&#39;re doing like yeah remote stuff

03:09:45.679 --> 03:09:50.719
Caption: um

03:09:47.839 --> 03:09:53.358
Caption: pair programming pull requests reviews

03:09:50.719 --> 03:09:55.040
Caption: you just jump on a call using whatever

03:09:53.359 --> 03:09:56.959
Caption: conference calling platform your choice

03:09:55.040 --> 03:09:58.559
Caption: and just be like hey can we walk through

03:09:56.959 --> 03:10:00.559
Caption: this together here&#39;s a live share link

03:09:58.559 --> 03:10:02.398
Caption: actually live chat has built-in audio

03:10:00.559 --> 03:10:03.679
Caption: support as well so you don&#39;t even need a

03:10:02.399 --> 03:10:05.120
Caption: separate conference calling platform but

03:10:03.679 --> 03:10:07.199
Caption: yeah it&#39;s like let&#39;s just walk through

Caption: the perth branch has only launched in

04:55:03.919 --> 04:55:09.359
Caption: august of 2021 so it&#39;s it&#39;s reasonably

04:55:06.718 --> 04:55:11.601
Caption: new uh for perth at least

04:55:09.359 --> 04:55:12.796

Caption: us

04:55:12.798 --> 04:55:16.638
Caption: and it&#39;s been upon us for some time now

04:55:14.560 --> 04:55:18.958
Caption: but the game has definitely changed in

04:55:16.638 --> 04:55:21.521
Caption: order to combat closed borders

04:55:18.957 --> 04:55:22.558
Caption: restricted travel and just a

04:55:21.519 --> 04:55:25.359
Caption: generally

04:55:22.560 --> 04:55:27.679
Caption: adverse attitude towards changing jobs

04:55:25.359 --> 04:55:29.439

04:55:38.638 --> 04:55:42.798
Caption: main challenge for a lot of businesses

04:55:40.957 --> 04:55:45.439
Caption: pretty much all technology businesses in

04:55:42.798 --> 04:55:48.798
Caption: perth is how do we attract and retain

04:55:45.439 --> 04:55:50.478
Caption: the best possible talent in the market

04:55:48.798 --> 04:55:51.919
Caption: as a business we&#39;re still working on

04:55:50.480 --> 04:55:53.361
Caption: this we&#39;re still fine-tuning this

04:55:51.919 --> 04:55:54.400
Caption: process

04:55:53.359 --> 04:55:56.240
Caption: but there&#39;s a number of talent

04:55:54.400 --> 04:55:58.958
Caption: acquisition strategies that we&#39;ve put in

04:55:56.240 --> 04:56:01.519
Caption: place over the last 12 or so months

04:55:58.957 --> 04:56:03.839
Caption: to grow from a team of four to a team of

04:56:01.519 --> 04:56:07.279
Caption: 31 technical consultants working with

04:56:03.839 --> 04:56:09.279
Caption: some of the latest in cloud technology

04:56:07.279 --> 04:56:12.240
Caption: i walked into the serving office in

04:56:09.279 --> 04:56:14.398
Caption: august of 2021 um

04:56:12.240 --> 04:56:15.839
Caption: i probably didn&#39;t do my due diligence at

04:56:14.400 --> 04:56:18.160
Caption: the time and didn&#39;t actually realize how

04:56:15.839 --> 04:56:19.279
Caption: small the team was so i walked into the

04:56:18.160 --> 04:56:20.560
Caption: building

04:56:19.279 --> 04:56:23.759
Caption: and one of the principal consultants

04:56:20.560 --> 04:56:24.718
Caption: said yep this is it all four of us

04:56:23.759 --> 04:56:26.957
Caption: great

04:56:24.718 --> 04:56:28.958
Caption: um so at that point i really i knew two

04:56:26.957 --> 04:56:31.039
Caption: things one i wasn&#39;t going to be made

04:56:28.957 --> 04:56:33.439
Caption: redundant any time soon

04:56:31.039 --> 04:56:34.318
Caption: and two we&#39;ve got a lot of work ahead of

04:56:33.439 --> 04:56:36.558
Caption: us

04:56:34.320 --> 04:56:39.201
Caption: i was essentially tasked with building

04:56:36.560 --> 04:56:40.480
Caption: the perth team from the ground up the

04:56:39.199 --> 04:56:42.080
Caption: regional partner at the time had

04:56:40.480 --> 04:56:44.400
Caption: basically said to me look if you can

04:56:42.080 --> 04:56:46.958
Caption: find a couple of you know software

04:56:44.400 --> 04:56:50.400
Caption: professionals or devops engineers in the

04:56:46.957 --> 04:56:51.759
Caption: first 12 months great fantastic now i&#39;d

04:56:50.400 --> 04:56:54.480
Caption: heard along the grapevine that our

04:56:51.759 --> 04:56:56.240
Caption: brisbane office had gone from zero to 65

04:56:54.480 --> 04:56:57.121
Caption: technical consultants in about three

04:56:56.240 --> 04:56:59.201
Caption: years

04:56:57.119 --> 04:57:01.039
Caption: i was not going to let brisbane beat me

04:56:59.199 --> 04:57:03.679
Caption: apparently recruiters by nature are very

04:57:01.039 --> 04:57:06.478
Caption: competitive people

04:57:03.679 --> 04:57:07.839
Caption: so yeah look you know 12 months later

04:57:06.480 --> 04:57:10.958
Caption: we&#39;ve been able to successfully build a

04:57:07.839 --> 04:57:12.876
Caption: team of 31 technical consultants across

04:57:10.957 --> 04:57:15.359
Caption: data engineering devops engineering

04:57:12.878 --> 04:57:16.798
Caption: cloud engineering cyber security and

04:57:15.359 --> 04:57:18.398
Caption: software development

04:57:16.798 --> 04:57:20.480
Caption: so again why is this presentation to

04:57:18.400 --> 04:57:21.839
Caption: every relevant to everybody in the room

04:57:20.480 --> 04:57:23.041
Caption: well all we have to do is just look at

04:57:21.839 --> 04:57:25.279
Caption: seek and look at some of the adverts

04:57:23.039 --> 04:57:27.199
Caption: that are currently advertised

04:57:25.279 --> 04:57:28.957
Caption: now before we get stuck in let&#39;s just

04:57:27.199 --> 04:57:30.636
Caption: take a second to have a look at the

04:57:28.957 --> 04:57:32.398
Caption: perth market in terms of the perth

04:57:30.638 --> 04:57:34.320
Caption: technology market

04:57:32.400 --> 04:57:35.361
Caption: please keep in mind that this was a

04:57:34.320 --> 04:57:37.439
Caption: study

04:57:35.359 --> 04:57:39.039
Caption: that i did actually with thank you to

04:57:37.439 --> 04:57:40.796
Caption: the rob walters team who helped me with

04:57:39.039 --> 04:57:42.716
Caption: some of the insights

04:57:40.798 --> 04:57:45.041
Caption: but this is based on statistics that are

04:57:42.718 --> 04:57:47.361
Caption: only available on linkedin so

04:57:45.039 --> 04:57:48.796
Caption: if a person hasn&#39;t got their profile on

04:57:47.359 --> 04:57:51.359
Caption: linkedin they&#39;re obviously not included

04:57:48.798 --> 04:57:51.361
Caption: in the study

04:57:52.240 --> 04:57:59.359
Caption: so according to linkedin we have 3241

04:57:56.957 --> 04:58:01.279
Caption: software professionals in perth

04:57:59.359 --> 04:58:02.478
Caption: so that&#39;s not a whole heap much to my

04:58:01.279 --> 04:58:04.716
Caption: disappointment probably everyone&#39;s

04:58:02.480 --> 04:58:06.320
Caption: disappointment software developers don&#39;t

04:58:04.718 --> 04:58:08.958
Caption: grow on trees

04:58:06.320 --> 04:58:10.958
Caption: um of the 3241

04:58:08.957 --> 04:58:15.199
Caption: software professionals in perth in the

04:58:10.957 --> 04:58:18.876
Caption: last 12 months we&#39;ve had 749 change job

04:58:15.199 --> 04:58:21.679
Caption: which is about 23 of the perth market

04:58:18.878 --> 04:58:24.400
Caption: 16 of the perth software professional

04:58:21.679 --> 04:58:26.560
Caption: market identifies female and the average

04:58:24.400 --> 04:58:28.958
Caption: tenure with any organization is one and

04:58:26.560 --> 04:58:30.560
Caption: a half years this is just a quick

04:58:28.957 --> 04:58:32.876
Caption: breakdown on

04:58:30.560 --> 04:58:35.121
Caption: the actual dynamics of the um the

04:58:32.878 --> 04:58:37.521
Caption: software dev market so we&#39;ve got

04:58:35.119 --> 04:58:40.000
Caption: about 2 000 software developers about

04:58:37.519 --> 04:58:41.439
Caption: 700 or so senior software engineers and

04:58:40.000 --> 04:58:43.199
Caption: a couple of other positions in there as

04:58:41.439 --> 04:58:45.519
Caption: well

04:58:43.199 --> 04:58:47.199
Caption: let&#39;s have a look at data engineers

04:58:45.519 --> 04:58:50.876
Caption: so again these stats are only based on

04:58:47.199 --> 04:58:52.876
Caption: what&#39;s actually out there on linkedin

04:58:50.878 --> 04:58:56.638
Caption: so you can see here that we&#39;ve got a

04:58:52.878 --> 04:58:58.240
Caption: total of 263 data engineers senior data

04:58:56.638 --> 04:59:00.480
Caption: engineers and other related data

04:58:58.240 --> 04:59:02.718
Caption: professional titles in the market

04:59:00.480 --> 04:59:05.201

Caption: 94 have changed jobs in the last 12

04:59:05.199 --> 04:59:11.679
Caption: months which is pretty staggering that&#39;s

04:59:07.679 --> 04:59:13.599
Caption: 35 36 percent of the entire market has

04:59:11.679 --> 04:59:16.080
Caption: moved the job within data engineering in

04:59:13.599 --> 04:59:18.080
Caption: the last 12 months

04:59:16.080 --> 04:59:20.000
Caption: diversity probably fares slightly better

04:59:18.080 --> 04:59:22.480
Caption: with 26 percent of the market

04:59:20.000 --> 04:59:24.400
Caption: identifying as female and again the

04:59:22.480 --> 04:59:28.320
Caption: average median temperature with any

04:59:24.400 --> 04:59:28.320
Caption: organization is one and a half years

04:59:28.480 --> 04:59:32.240
Caption: this is a scary one we&#39;ve only got 52

04:59:30.480 --> 04:59:33.919
Caption: senior data engineers in perth i feel

04:59:32.240 --> 04:59:36.080
Caption: like there&#39;s something wrong with that

04:59:33.919 --> 04:59:37.439
Caption: but

04:59:36.080 --> 04:59:38.958
Caption: lastly we&#39;ll have a look at another

04:59:37.439 --> 04:59:42.400
Caption: really challenging skill set to hire in

04:59:38.957 --> 04:59:44.558
Caption: perth which is cloud professionals

04:59:42.400 --> 04:59:46.160
Caption: so again according to linkedin the cloud

04:59:44.560 --> 04:59:49.281
Caption: technology market tells us that there

04:59:46.160 --> 04:59:51.041
Caption: are 253 cloud technology professionals

04:59:49.279 --> 04:59:53.039
Caption: listed on linkedin

04:59:51.039 --> 04:59:55.279
Caption: of the 253

04:59:53.039 --> 04:59:57.119
Caption: 69 have changed job in the past 12

04:59:55.279 --> 04:59:59.359
Caption: months 12 percent of the market

04:59:57.119 --> 05:00:01.519
Caption: identifies female and again the at the

04:59:59.359 --> 05:00:05.080
Caption: median tenure with an organization is

05:00:01.519 --> 05:00:05.080
Caption: one and a half years

05:00:06.240 --> 05:00:08.878
Caption: so

05:00:07.119 --> 05:00:11.519
Caption: what does this tell us about the tech

05:00:08.878 --> 05:00:13.441
Caption: market in perth

05:00:11.519 --> 05:00:14.796
Caption: it&#39;s pretty tight

05:00:13.439 --> 05:00:16.080
Caption: it&#39;s pretty tall i think that we can all

05:00:14.798 --> 05:00:17.441
Caption: agree that

05:00:16.080 --> 05:00:18.878

05:00:20.240 --> 05:00:23.599
Caption: interesting projects

05:00:22.080 --> 05:00:25.599

Caption: same sorts of professionals to help us

05:00:25.599 --> 05:00:30.320
Caption: on that journey

05:00:26.957 --> 05:00:30.318
Caption: so how do we overcome this challenge

05:00:30.480 --> 05:00:33.519
Caption: maths and relationships

05:00:32.798 --> 05:00:35.681
Caption: so

05:00:33.519 --> 05:00:38.480
Caption: back when i first started in recruitment

05:00:35.679 --> 05:00:39.919

05:00:46.000 --> 05:00:48.798
Caption: recruitment didn&#39;t really believe it too

05:00:47.679 --> 05:00:50.320
Caption: much but

05:00:48.798 --> 05:00:52.240
Caption: looking back on it now that i&#39;ve matured

05:00:50.320 --> 05:00:54.080
Caption: a little bit more i very much believe

05:00:52.240 --> 05:00:56.400
Caption: that effective recruitment in today&#39;s

05:00:54.080 --> 05:00:59.119
Caption: market especially in perth consists of

05:00:56.400 --> 05:01:00.839
Caption: two really key elements and that is

05:00:59.119 --> 05:01:03.759
Caption: maths and

05:01:00.839 --> 05:01:05.119
Caption: relationships but ryan how does maths

05:01:03.759 --> 05:01:06.638
Caption: relate to recruitment don&#39;t you just

05:01:05.119 --> 05:01:08.478
Caption: call people up and ask them about

05:01:06.638 --> 05:01:10.638
Caption: opportunities and jobs

05:01:08.480 --> 05:01:13.041
Caption: it&#39;s a great question

05:01:10.638 --> 05:01:14.560
Caption: so i&#39;d be interested to hear maybe some

05:01:13.039 --> 05:01:16.078
Caption: stats from the people in the crowd

05:01:14.560 --> 05:01:18.480
Caption: especially recruiters and talent

05:01:16.080 --> 05:01:20.080
Caption: acquisition specialists in the room um

05:01:18.480 --> 05:01:21.361
Caption: maybe at a later date but look for the

05:01:20.080 --> 05:01:23.279
Caption: time being i&#39;m happy to use my

05:01:21.359 --> 05:01:24.876
Caption: statistics with serbian as a bit of an

05:01:23.279 --> 05:01:25.839
Caption: example

05:01:24.878 --> 05:01:28.160
Caption: so

05:01:25.839 --> 05:01:32.080
Caption: in the last 12 months serbian perth has

05:01:28.160 --> 05:01:33.679
Caption: had 1200 applications across a number of

05:01:32.080 --> 05:01:35.839
Caption: different professions so software

05:01:33.679 --> 05:01:39.839
Caption: development data engineering

05:01:35.839 --> 05:01:39.839
Caption: devops cloud and cyber security

05:01:39.919 --> 05:01:46.240
Caption: of those 1210 applications will take 243

05:01:43.679 --> 05:01:47.919
Caption: through to the first round of interview

05:01:46.240 --> 05:01:49.759
Caption: 90 will make it through to the technical

05:01:47.919 --> 05:01:52.560
Caption: exercise that we have so we get everyone

05:01:49.759 --> 05:01:55.279
Caption: to undergo a technical exercise

05:01:52.560 --> 05:01:58.240
Caption: and of the 220 that take the exercise

05:01:55.279 --> 05:02:00.478
Caption: only 118 will pass

05:01:58.240 --> 05:02:02.240
Caption: 118 will go through to the second round

05:02:00.480 --> 05:02:03.759
Caption: of interview which is with one of our

05:02:02.240 --> 05:02:05.679
Caption: principal consultants

05:02:03.759 --> 05:02:07.359
Caption: 61 making it through to the final round

05:02:05.679 --> 05:02:09.839
Caption: of interview

05:02:07.359 --> 05:02:13.119
Caption: so it brings us to a grand total of 39

05:02:09.839 --> 05:02:15.679
Caption: being offered and 28 accepting

05:02:13.119 --> 05:02:18.158
Caption: so what does the maths tell us

05:02:15.679 --> 05:02:20.480
Caption: so look let&#39;s work it back let&#39;s let&#39;s

05:02:18.160 --> 05:02:22.638
Caption: look at what does it take to hire 28

05:02:20.480 --> 05:02:24.320
Caption: talented technologists across a 12 month

05:02:22.638 --> 05:02:27.160
Caption: period

05:02:24.320 --> 05:02:29.439
Caption: i&#39;ll need to speak to roughly

05:02:27.160 --> 05:02:31.759
Caption: 25.521 candidates a week which is

05:02:29.439 --> 05:02:34.478
Caption: roughly five candidates a day

05:02:31.759 --> 05:02:37.519
Caption: i&#39;ll need to interview 5.06 qualified

05:02:34.480 --> 05:02:40.240
Caption: candidates a week one a day

05:02:37.519 --> 05:02:42.480
Caption: i need to have at least 2.46 candidates

05:02:40.240 --> 05:02:44.878
Caption: at a second round interview

05:02:42.480 --> 05:02:47.281
Caption: and 1.27 candidates at a final round

05:02:44.878 --> 05:02:49.281
Caption: interview

05:02:47.279 --> 05:02:51.759
Caption: so in order to hire two or three

05:02:49.279 --> 05:02:53.119
Caption: candidates per month

05:02:51.759 --> 05:02:55.039
Caption: that&#39;s sort of what we need to do in

05:02:53.119 --> 05:02:56.796
Caption: terms of process from an interview and

05:02:55.039 --> 05:02:58.078
Caption: recruitment point of view

05:02:56.798 --> 05:02:59.601
Caption: now if you&#39;re wondering you know we&#39;ve

05:02:58.080 --> 05:03:01.679
Caption: got a talent acquisition team we&#39;ve got

05:02:59.599 --> 05:03:03.199
Caption: a recruitment team um maybe why are they

05:03:01.679 --> 05:03:05.199
Caption: not looking at or why they&#39;re not

05:03:03.199 --> 05:03:07.359
Caption: getting the same sorts of results from

05:03:05.199 --> 05:03:09.359
Caption: my internal team i&#39;d probably encourage

05:03:07.359 --> 05:03:11.279
Caption: you just to have a look at i suppose

05:03:09.359 --> 05:03:12.796
Caption: working at backwards and re-engineering

05:03:11.279 --> 05:03:14.716
Caption: that process

05:03:12.798 --> 05:03:17.121
Caption: you know looking at how efficient how

05:03:14.718 --> 05:03:18.638
Caption: effective that process is

05:03:17.119 --> 05:03:19.919
Caption: and hopefully the answers should lie in

05:03:18.638 --> 05:03:21.441
Caption: there for you

05:03:19.919 --> 05:03:23.839
Caption: now in addition to this

05:03:21.439 --> 05:03:26.796
Caption: we&#39;ve highlighted just how

05:03:23.839 --> 05:03:28.400
Caption: tight the perth market can be

05:03:26.798 --> 05:03:32.121
Caption: so we need to really be thinking about

05:03:28.400 --> 05:03:35.361
Caption: how our brand is engaging with those

05:03:32.119 --> 05:03:38.080
Caption: 3241 software developers in perth how am

05:03:35.359 --> 05:03:40.080
Caption: i managing relationships with the 263

05:03:38.080 --> 05:03:43.041
Caption: data engineers or how am i being

05:03:40.080 --> 05:03:45.519
Caption: perceived by the 253 cloud professionals

05:03:43.039 --> 05:03:45.519
Caption: in perth

05:03:45.759 --> 05:03:50.080
Caption: so we know what the challenges are

05:03:47.599 --> 05:03:51.279
Caption: finding talent&#39;s really hard

05:03:50.080 --> 05:03:53.041
Caption: through the pandemic there&#39;s been some

05:03:51.279 --> 05:03:55.279
Caption: real constraints around the movement of

05:03:53.039 --> 05:03:56.957
Caption: human capital

05:03:55.279 --> 05:03:59.199
Caption: and now that things are sort of returned

05:03:56.957 --> 05:04:01.119
Caption: to a level of normality

05:03:59.199 --> 05:04:03.039
Caption: i don&#39;t know about you but 263 data

05:04:01.119 --> 05:04:05.759
Caption: engineers in perth is that&#39;s just not

05:04:03.039 --> 05:04:07.679
Caption: enough as according to linkedin so the

05:04:05.759 --> 05:04:09.359
Caption: challenge for us is how do we open up

05:04:07.679 --> 05:04:12.796
Caption: this talent pool how do we how do we

05:04:09.359 --> 05:04:14.716
Caption: widen the market that we currently have

05:04:12.798 --> 05:04:17.521
Caption: so

05:04:14.718 --> 05:04:20.798
Caption: let&#39;s explore interstate talent

05:04:17.519 --> 05:04:22.636
Caption: perth is a pretty cool place to live

05:04:20.798 --> 05:04:24.240
Caption: reasonably

05:04:22.638 --> 05:04:26.160
Caption: i suppose

05:04:24.240 --> 05:04:27.919
Caption: the standard of living is is pretty good

05:04:26.160 --> 05:04:29.199
Caption: house prizes aren&#39;t the same as what

05:04:27.919 --> 05:04:30.560
Caption: they are in sydney

05:04:29.199 --> 05:04:32.160
Caption: so straight away i think we&#39;ve got some

05:04:30.560 --> 05:04:33.521
Caption: really good things going for us as a

05:04:32.160 --> 05:04:37.359
Caption: state

05:04:33.519 --> 05:04:37.359
Caption: i reckon i would have probably

05:04:37.439 --> 05:04:41.359
Caption: one in ten candidates come through the

05:04:39.439 --> 05:04:43.199
Caption: process that will come from

05:04:41.359 --> 05:04:45.039
Caption: melbourne or sydney

05:04:43.199 --> 05:04:47.599
Caption: and they&#39;ll come to us with the reasons

05:04:45.039 --> 05:04:49.679
Caption: of perth is a great place to live it&#39;s a

05:04:47.599 --> 05:04:50.876
Caption: great place to raise a family i can

05:04:49.679 --> 05:04:52.480
Caption: afford a house

05:04:50.878 --> 05:04:54.240
Caption: that&#39;s a really good start

05:04:52.480 --> 05:04:55.679
Caption: in addition to that

05:04:54.240 --> 05:04:56.958
Caption: you know let&#39;s look at maybe some of the

05:04:55.679 --> 05:04:58.400
Caption: um the skilled migrants that we could

05:04:56.957 --> 05:04:59.519
Caption: potentially explore

05:04:58.400 --> 05:05:01.041
Caption: so

05:04:59.519 --> 05:05:02.240
Caption: earlier this year the west australian

05:05:01.039 --> 05:05:03.679
Caption: government and the federal government

05:05:02.240 --> 05:05:05.919
Caption: put in place

05:05:03.679 --> 05:05:08.080
Caption: some changes to the legislation around

05:05:05.919 --> 05:05:09.519
Caption: easing of movement for skilled migrants

05:05:08.080 --> 05:05:12.160
Caption: so the perth metro region was

05:05:09.519 --> 05:05:14.240
Caption: essentially reclassified as a regional

05:05:12.160 --> 05:05:16.718
Caption: area so this has really opened the door

05:05:14.240 --> 05:05:18.400
Caption: for a number of different migrants from

05:05:16.718 --> 05:05:20.080
Caption: all over the country who are keen to

05:05:18.400 --> 05:05:23.679
Caption: work in australia but are obviously

05:05:20.080 --> 05:05:24.638
Caption: limited with regards to opportunities

05:05:23.679 --> 05:05:26.320
Caption: and

05:05:24.638 --> 05:05:28.160
Caption: it&#39;s an interesting thing to think about

05:05:26.320 --> 05:05:30.718
Caption: prior to this you know yes you could

05:05:28.160 --> 05:05:32.080
Caption: potentially come and work in in perth

05:05:30.718 --> 05:05:33.919
Caption: as a devops engineer but you&#39;d have to

05:05:32.080 --> 05:05:35.759
Caption: go and work in the bush which wouldn&#39;t

05:05:33.919 --> 05:05:37.039
Caption: really make a lot of sense especially

05:05:35.759 --> 05:05:38.716
Caption: you know when you&#39;re trying to build

05:05:37.039 --> 05:05:39.439
Caption: collaborative teams

05:05:38.718 --> 05:05:41.201
Caption: so

05:05:39.439 --> 05:05:44.400
Caption: the changes made by the wa government

05:05:41.199 --> 05:05:46.080
Caption: basically enabled priority processing of

05:05:44.400 --> 05:05:48.718
Caption: regional visas and perth has now been

05:05:46.080 --> 05:05:50.878
Caption: reclassified as a regional zone

05:05:48.718 --> 05:05:52.400
Caption: in addition to that access to regional

05:05:50.878 --> 05:05:54.560
Caption: occupations list which has obviously

05:05:52.400 --> 05:05:56.080
Caption: been opened out so there&#39;s more jobs

05:05:54.560 --> 05:05:59.201
Caption: that have actually been included on that

05:05:56.080 --> 05:06:01.119
Caption: list of potential um employability

05:05:59.199 --> 05:06:03.199
Caption: um so as a result of this i found we&#39;ve

05:06:01.119 --> 05:06:05.359
Caption: had a real influx of people looking to

05:06:03.199 --> 05:06:06.957
Caption: actually fast track some of their visas

05:06:05.359 --> 05:06:08.636
Caption: um you know in melbourne and sydney

05:06:06.957 --> 05:06:11.599
Caption: people can be waiting upwards of six to

05:06:08.638 --> 05:06:13.281
Caption: nine months for a potential visa but

05:06:11.599 --> 05:06:15.119
Caption: with the west australian government

05:06:13.279 --> 05:06:18.000
Caption: sending out invitations to apply for the

05:06:15.119 --> 05:06:19.359
Caption: 190 visa they really are trying to drive

05:06:18.000 --> 05:06:20.718
Caption: a lot of people at you know getting

05:06:19.359 --> 05:06:24.398
Caption: across the state or getting across the

05:06:20.718 --> 05:06:26.000
Caption: country into wa

05:06:24.400 --> 05:06:28.320
Caption: so whilst we&#39;re on the topic of

05:06:26.000 --> 05:06:30.160
Caption: international candidates or

05:06:28.320 --> 05:06:31.359
Caption: people relocating

05:06:30.160 --> 05:06:34.480
Caption: i had a really good interesting

05:06:31.359 --> 05:06:36.716
Caption: conversation with one of our senior

05:06:34.480 --> 05:06:38.798
Caption: devops engineers who&#39;s just joined us

05:06:36.718 --> 05:06:40.240
Caption: not so long ago

05:06:38.798 --> 05:06:43.121
Caption: i was asking sort of about his

05:06:40.240 --> 05:06:44.320
Caption: experience and just a bit of context so

05:06:43.119 --> 05:06:46.957
Caption: gcp

05:06:44.320 --> 05:06:48.798
Caption: aws like five or six years of experience

05:06:46.957 --> 05:06:50.716
Caption: just a brilliant guy

05:06:48.798 --> 05:06:52.560
Caption: um you know a skill set that is really

05:06:50.718 --> 05:06:55.041
Caption: highly in demand especially in the perth

05:06:52.560 --> 05:06:57.599
Caption: market but really any market

05:06:55.039 --> 05:07:00.398
Caption: and i was talking to him about his his

05:06:57.599 --> 05:07:02.240
Caption: um how he felt about our process and

05:07:00.400 --> 05:07:03.839
Caption: you know i put the question to him of

05:07:02.240 --> 05:07:05.759
Caption: were you interviewing with anybody else

05:07:03.839 --> 05:07:07.519
Caption: any other organizations in australia

05:07:05.759 --> 05:07:09.119
Caption: when you were looking to make the move

05:07:07.519 --> 05:07:11.759
Caption: and he said to me that he&#39;d applied for

05:07:09.119 --> 05:07:14.398
Caption: 51 51 positions

05:07:11.759 --> 05:07:15.839
Caption: and he&#39;d heard back from two

05:07:14.400 --> 05:07:17.201
Caption: which is us

05:07:15.839 --> 05:07:18.796
Caption: who snagged him

05:07:17.199 --> 05:07:23.199
Caption: and there was one other organisation in

05:07:18.798 --> 05:07:24.958
Caption: melbourne so this is a devops and cloud

05:07:23.199 --> 05:07:26.796
Caption: professional who&#39;s applied for devops

05:07:24.957 --> 05:07:29.199
Caption: and cloud related positions and he&#39;s

05:07:26.798 --> 05:07:29.919
Caption: only heard back from two organizations

05:07:29.199 --> 05:07:31.919
Caption: so

05:07:29.919 --> 05:07:34.080
Caption: i think like this is a really

05:07:31.919 --> 05:07:35.599
Caption: old-school way of thinking um you know

05:07:34.080 --> 05:07:37.839
Caption: we&#39;re shutting we&#39;re we&#39;re crying out as

05:07:35.599 --> 05:07:40.000

05:08:41.919 --> 05:08:45.839
Caption: across a four year period straight away

05:08:44.638 --> 05:08:47.601

05:08:45.839 --> 05:08:49.679
Caption: i suppose we we fight back against two

05:08:47.599 --> 05:08:51.199

05:08:49.679 --> 05:08:52.957

05:08:51.199 --> 05:08:54.636

05:08:54.638 --> 05:08:58.638

Caption: median tenure with an organisation

05:08:58.638 --> 05:09:02.798

05:09:01.359 --> 05:09:03.759
Caption: with an organization for one and a half

05:09:02.798 --> 05:09:05.761
Caption: years

05:09:03.759 --> 05:09:07.839
Caption: the visa obviously we&#39;re investing in

05:09:05.759 --> 05:09:10.000
Caption: them they&#39;re investing in us with us for

05:09:07.839 --> 05:09:11.359
Caption: a period of about four years or so

05:09:10.000 --> 05:09:12.638

05:09:11.359 --> 05:09:14.558
Caption: into

05:09:12.638 --> 05:09:17.041

Caption: talent attracts talent

05:09:17.039 --> 05:09:21.119
Caption: so you know in order to sort of attract

05:09:19.519 --> 05:09:23.679
Caption: good talent we need to understand what

05:09:21.119 --> 05:09:25.119
Caption: motivates talent now how do we do this

05:09:23.679 --> 05:09:27.599
Caption: it&#39;s pretty easy

05:09:25.119 --> 05:09:29.839
Caption: honest transparent conversations with

Caption: what they&#39;re doing what they want to do

05:09:32.000 --> 05:09:35.839

05:09:33.919 --> 05:09:37.359
Caption: strategy together to get them where they

05:09:35.839 --> 05:09:38.876

05:09:37.359 --> 05:09:40.240

Caption: with the business we can put these

05:09:41.919 --> 05:09:45.759

05:09:43.759 --> 05:09:47.039

Caption: business

05:09:47.039 --> 05:09:50.158
Caption: um another really important aspect of

05:09:48.957 --> 05:09:52.238
Caption: this is being able to provide a

05:09:50.160 --> 05:09:54.000
Caption: financial incentive

05:09:52.240 --> 05:09:56.080
Caption: this should always come in in a monetary

05:09:54.000 --> 05:09:58.400

05:09:56.080 --> 05:10:00.798

05:10:05.359 --> 05:10:09.679
Caption: motivate people to have conversations

05:10:07.759 --> 05:10:11.919
Caption: with old colleagues

05:10:09.679 --> 05:10:15.439
Caption: and and get people to flip me the cv and

05:10:11.919 --> 05:10:18.000
