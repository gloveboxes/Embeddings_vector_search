  "description": "Depending on who you ask, 15-20% of the world\u0027s population has some form of disability. Despite this, the vast majority of software isn\u0027t fully accessible. Building truly accessible systems starts with asking questions. What does it mean to be disabled? How do we know whether people can use our website? And what if our users have access issues that we don\u0027t know about?\\n\\nMany of these core concepts are covered by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, which are the governing standard for web accessibility. However, some scenarios require us to dig a little deeper. We\u0027ll look at situations where you might need to think beyond the guidelines, and some of the resources and tools that you can use to help you do so.\\n\\nFinally, we\u0027ll learn how to meet a variety of different accessibility requirements by breaking down a series of real-world case studies. We\u0027ll take a magnifying glass to a large tech company\u0027s user interfaces, time travel back to the GeoCities era, apply some concepts from emergency press conferences to online content delivery, hack a life-saving medical device, and attempt to navigate technical events (and stairs). By the end of the talk, you should understand why it\u0027s important to evaluate the accessibility of your software, what goes wrong when assessments don\u0027t happen, and how to apply these lessons to design systems that work for everyone.\\n\\nNo experience necessary\\n45 mins\\nDesign \\u0026 UX\\nDawn likes to tinker with cloud infrastructure and security, and regularly goes down rabbit holes in a futile search for ways to develop systems that are both reliable and impenetrable. As well as accidental accessibility advocacy, Dawn can regularly be found sharing knowledge within the Melbourne cloud infrastructure and DevOps communities.\\n\\nOutside work, Dawn is an occasional author, kitchen alchemist, and raging sportsball fan.\\n\\n\u0027This recording is licensed under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode).
