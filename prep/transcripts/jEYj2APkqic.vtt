Caption: um are they aware the Project&#39;s coming

Caption: um okay cool now I recall when we spoke

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:46.378
Caption: previously you said you wanted this to

00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:48.779
Caption: be an agile project so the IT team and

00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:52.378
Caption: the business familiar with agile not

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:55.098
Caption: exactly but that&#39;s why we have you

00:02:52.378 --> 00:02:55.098
Caption: right

00:02:55.279 --> 00:03:00.000
Caption: so have we at least got a product owner

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:01.619
Caption: yeah I&#39;ve got great news we&#39;ve got a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.018
Caption: product owner called Robert he&#39;s from

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:06.720
Caption: records and he&#39;s an up-and-coming star

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:08.399
Caption: here&#39;s what you might call an SME

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.378
Caption: um he knows a lot about our business and

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:12.238
Caption: was involved in the last incarnation of

00:03:10.378 --> 00:03:13.800
Caption: this project

00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:15.598
Caption: it doesn&#39;t sound like Robert&#39;s very

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.518
Caption: senior though can he make the decisions

00:03:15.598 --> 00:03:18.779
Caption: that need to be made oh that&#39;s fine

00:03:17.518 --> 00:03:21.360
Caption: Robert will have to work with the

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:24.119
Caption: committee on all decisions

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.738
Caption: so we have a committee then yeah we&#39;ve

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:28.799
Caption: got our standard board and they meet

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:30.119
Caption: monthly we can have an urgent decision

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.919
Caption: meeting but no more than once a

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:33.360
Caption: fortnight

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.220
Caption: right

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.080
Caption: um I&#39;ve got to say I&#39;m a bit concerned

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.518
Caption: about this because you know in an agile

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.759
Caption: project we need to be able to make

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:43.319
Caption: decisions almost on the spot

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:45.238
Caption: um but anyway

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.679
Caption: um you mentioned a previous Incarnation

00:03:45.238 --> 00:03:49.559
Caption: what happened with that why didn&#39;t it

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:51.000
Caption: succeed well it was a new technology the

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:53.098
Caption: IT team didn&#39;t know what they were doing

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.259
Caption: it dragged on and took forever so we

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:57.539
Caption: kind of canceled it I also don&#39;t think

00:03:55.259 --> 00:04:00.899
Caption: the project manager was very good

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:01.979
Caption: poor project manager luckily we have you

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:04.458
Caption: this time

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.458
Caption: laughs

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.378
Caption: um all right so I&#39;d like to start

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.419
Caption: talking to the business if I can because

00:04:10.378 --> 00:04:14.639
Caption: this this Project&#39;s actually going to

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.500
Caption: impact a lot of people so the sooner I

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.540
Caption: can start talking to them better so can

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.699
Caption: you tell me who I should talk to there&#39;s

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.100
Caption: no need to talk to the business the IT

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.899
Caption: team know exactly what we need this is a

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.880
Caption: like for like replacement of our current

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:29.299
Caption: system so we have all the requirements

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.300
Caption: laid out

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:35.519
Caption: oh dear this is gonna be good

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:37.619
Caption: I really think we need to talk to the

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:40.198
Caption: business because you know there&#39;s going

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:41.639
Caption: to be a huge change impact here

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.320
Caption: um do we at least have an internal

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.660
Caption: change management team that I can

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.580
Caption: leverage we&#39;ve got a corporate comms

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.679
Caption: team and they can manage most of that

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:52.019
Caption: and for anything else I&#39;m sure you can

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:54.239
Caption: handle it anyway I&#39;ve got a meeting to

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:57.799
Caption: run to nice chat

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:57.799
Caption: thanks trends

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:05.220
Caption: [Applause]

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.199
Caption: and P.S Trent would never say any of

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.479
Caption: those things he actually he actually

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.699
Caption: heads up our design crew so you know

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.779
Caption: business engagement user experience all

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.779
Caption: those things are pretty important

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:21.299
Caption: so is this project destined to become

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:23.339
Caption: project insanity if it could go wrong it

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:27.418
Caption: will go wrong in this there is so many

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:28.859
Caption: things that are big red flags now In

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.080
Caption: fairness it&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;re going

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:33.478
Caption: to walk into a project which has all of

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:36.179
Caption: them but I&#39;m sure every single one of us

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:39.660
Caption: in this room has experienced many of

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:42.239
Caption: those particular scenarios before

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.639
Caption: so the reality is though there&#39;s a few

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:46.559
Caption: themes that come out when you actually

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.720
Caption: look at it so whilst there was a lot of

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:51.600
Caption: things that we raised there there were

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.940
Caption: some key themes that we talked about

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.360
Caption: so the first one&#39;s actually around

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:00.179
Caption: funding so there&#39;s no business case for

00:05:57.359 --> 00:06:01.739
Caption: this it&#39;s part of the Legacy replacement

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:03.899
Caption: fund

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:06.779
Caption: so what we&#39;ve got money to actually

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:08.880
Caption: change a system but we&#39;ve got no money

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:11.100
Caption: for anything else

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.739
Caption: nothing else on me I&#39;m the project

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.440
Caption: manager I&#39;m funded you know but what

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:18.839
Caption: about the rest of the team there&#39;s no

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.459
Caption: funding for additional resources we&#39;re

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:22.319
Caption: going to need some change management on

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:24.660
Caption: this we&#39;re replacing a legacy system

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.579
Caption: with something new how can we manage

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.220
Caption: without some change management it is

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:31.258
Caption: going to impact the business

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.419
Caption: and there&#39;s no budget allocated for the

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.739
Caption: internal resources either so if you

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:38.220
Caption: think about it we&#39;re going to use the

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:39.299
Caption: BAU resources fantastic but they&#39;ve got

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.059
Caption: a day job

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:44.159
Caption: and given that they have a day job

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:46.319
Caption: somebody&#39;s still got to do it that job

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.759
Caption: doesn&#39;t go away so if we want to use

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.440
Caption: those people then they&#39;re going to need

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.519
Caption: to be backfilled so we need some money

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.759
Caption: for it

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:55.019
Caption: so but money budget in this particular

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.600
Caption: scenario

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:59.459
Caption: the next one&#39;s resourcing so resourcing

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.759
Caption: generally is a big issue on this one

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:04.919
Caption: we&#39;ve got a product owner good news

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:07.979
Caption: he doesn&#39;t really he&#39;s not a product

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:11.160
Caption: owner he&#39;s a great guy clearly he knows

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:13.199
Caption: stuff he&#39;s only allocated 50 of the time

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.419
Caption: but he can&#39;t make any decisions

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.839
Caption: so how good a product owner is he going

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:17.839
Caption: to be

00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:21.419
Caption: the resources don&#39;t even know this is

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.399
Caption: coming yet

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:24.959
Caption: so yeah we&#39;re going to use the IT team

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:26.579
Caption: I&#39;ve just got to go talk to their

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:30.559
Caption: managers and get them on board that&#39;s

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:30.559
Caption: going to be easy yeah right

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:37.079
Caption: and they&#39;re only part-time

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:40.619
Caption: when you have resources who are only

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:44.698
Caption: part-time dedicated to a project it&#39;s

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:46.739
Caption: always a sign of potential issue and the

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:49.259
Caption: reason I say that is because if they&#39;ve

00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:50.519
Caption: got a BAU responsibility on one side of

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:52.679
Caption: the fence and they&#39;ve got a project

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:55.440
Caption: responsibility on another side of the

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:59.098
Caption: fence when they are trying when there&#39;s

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:02.459
Caption: a fire in BAU land guess what takes

00:07:59.098 --> 00:08:04.979
Caption: priority every time they will go back to

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:07.399
Caption: their BAU work and your project will

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:07.399
Caption: suffer

00:08:07.799 --> 00:08:12.899
Caption: so the next theme is around decision

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:15.539
Caption: making we&#39;ve got a committee yay

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:18.779
Caption: once a month we can get a decision that

00:08:15.539 --> 00:08:21.660
Caption: they want this to be agile hello this is

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:24.779
Caption: not going to happen right once a month

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.279
Caption: board decision and what&#39;s worse we all

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:28.919
Caption: know that with committees invariably

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:31.500
Caption: they don&#39;t make a decision straight away

00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:35.098
Caption: so it might be two months before you can

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:37.619
Caption: even get a decision or three even worse

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:40.140
Caption: and like I said before the product

00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:42.539
Caption: owners just not senior enough to make

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.338
Caption: decisions he&#39;s not a decision maker he&#39;s

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.919
Caption: not somebody that the organization will

00:08:44.338 --> 00:08:49.260
Caption: respect and agree to his decisions there

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:52.559
Caption: needs to be somebody at a very senior

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:55.880
Caption: level who other people will adhere to

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:55.880
Caption: the decisions that they&#39;re made

00:08:55.979 --> 00:09:01.320
Caption: business engagement

00:08:57.739 --> 00:09:04.320
Caption: no need to engage the business it know

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.720
Caption: what they want gotta love it how many

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.838
Caption: times have you heard that the IT team

00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:11.699
Caption: know exactly what the business wants

00:09:09.838 --> 00:09:14.700
Caption: how can they

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.739
Caption: sure they may know some of the things

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.660
Caption: that are wrong with the existing systems

00:09:16.739 --> 00:09:20.039
Caption: and they know some of the gripes that

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:22.440
Caption: come out of the business but they don&#39;t

00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:24.299
Caption: know everybody&#39;s job and all the things

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.398
Caption: that they do in their day-to-day job

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:29.159
Caption: they don&#39;t know the things that drive

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:30.659
Caption: those people insane because of what they

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:33.419
Caption: have to do with the systems they&#39;re

00:09:30.659 --> 00:09:37.518
Caption: doing they don&#39;t know the processes they

00:09:33.419 --> 00:09:37.518
Caption: do not know what the requirements are

00:09:37.739 --> 00:09:44.880
Caption: no ux gotta love this one

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:47.760
Caption: as Trent actually said recently there&#39;s

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:51.179
Caption: no such thing as no ux if you&#39;ve got

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.040
Caption: people involved and a system there is a

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:56.039
Caption: user experience

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:58.979
Caption: if you don&#39;t design for it it will be a

00:09:56.039 --> 00:10:01.199
Caption: bad experience you need to design for it

00:09:58.979 --> 00:10:03.679
Caption: to make sure that it&#39;s a good user

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.679
Caption: experience

00:10:03.778 --> 00:10:07.679
Caption: no change management yay we&#39;ve got a

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:09.838
Caption: comms team

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:11.159
Caption: so good they can send out some emails

00:10:09.838 --> 00:10:13.979
Caption: and they can put something up on their

00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:16.919
Caption: internet that&#39;s going to be really cool

00:10:13.979 --> 00:10:18.898
Caption: but that&#39;s not change management change

00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:21.659
Caption: management involves bringing people

00:10:18.898 --> 00:10:25.018
Caption: along the journey so that when they get

00:10:21.659 --> 00:10:26.879
Caption: to the end they Embrace whatever it is

00:10:25.018 --> 00:10:29.760
Caption: whatever technology it is that you&#39;re

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.799
Caption: trying to put in

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.479
Caption: like I said corporate comms are not

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:35.219
Caption: change managers

00:10:33.479 --> 00:10:36.479
Caption: and they&#39;ve got a very busy workload

00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:38.398
Caption: anyway so they&#39;re not going to be able

00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:41.398
Caption: to do very much

00:10:38.398 --> 00:10:44.099
Caption: and then the final bit

00:10:41.398 --> 00:10:46.739
Caption: agile they&#39;ve got no idea what agile is

00:10:44.099 --> 00:10:48.359
Caption: this is going to be an agile project yay

00:10:46.739 --> 00:10:50.219
Caption: if you&#39;re going to try and run an agile

00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:52.320
Caption: project for an organization that&#39;s never

00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:54.539
Caption: done agile before you&#39;re going to spend

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.338
Caption: an awful lot of time in coaching and

00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:58.199
Caption: training just to bring them along that

00:10:56.338 --> 00:10:59.700
Caption: Journey which is going to eat into the

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.320
Caption: time for the project

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.540
Caption: so in this particular case the

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.859
Caption: organization is very immature they don&#39;t

00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:05.940
Caption: know what they&#39;re letting themselves in

00:11:04.859 --> 00:11:07.078
Caption: for they don&#39;t even know what they&#39;ve

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.958
Caption: asked for

00:11:07.078 --> 00:11:12.500
Caption: and out of the box how many times have

00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:15.179
Caption: you heard this it&#39;s out of the box

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.979
Caption: no because customization it&#39;s just

00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:19.679
Caption: configuration and that&#39;s why we don&#39;t

00:11:16.979 --> 00:11:22.559
Caption: need to talk to the users hello have you

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:24.479
Caption: ever seen a legacy system replaced by

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:27.059
Caption: something off the shelf that&#39;s exactly

00:11:24.479 --> 00:11:30.000
Caption: the same that follows exactly the same

00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:32.578
Caption: processes as the previous one and why

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.578
Caption: would you do that anyway because the

00:11:32.578 --> 00:11:38.880
Caption: reason for changing is to improve things

00:11:35.578 --> 00:11:40.199
Caption: so either you&#39;re going to have to do a

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.599
Caption: lot of change management around

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:45.000
Caption: processes and organizations and how

00:11:42.599 --> 00:11:46.799
Caption: people work or you&#39;re going to have to

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.320
Caption: customize the heck out of this piece of

00:11:46.799 --> 00:11:51.419
Caption: software in order to make it feel like

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.760
Caption: the one they had before

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:55.260
Caption: and it&#39;s always configuration and how do

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.100
Caption: you configure it unless you talk to the

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.820
Caption: business

00:11:56.099 --> 00:12:04.619
Caption: you don&#39;t know what to configure it with

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:06.539
Caption: so lots and lots of red flags in here

00:12:04.619 --> 00:12:08.640
Caption: it&#39;s no wonder the last one failed if

00:12:06.539 --> 00:12:12.838
Caption: they followed the same premise last time

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:15.359
Caption: there it was never going to succeed

00:12:12.838 --> 00:12:17.640
Caption: so what can we do about it

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:20.640
Caption: as the project manager on this there are

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.200
Caption: a number of things that I can do

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.700
Caption: um well when my pictures have all gone

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.579
Caption: there we go there are a number of things

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:29.640
Caption: that I can do the first one

00:12:26.578 --> 00:12:32.578
Caption: is actually to do

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:36.679
Caption: to Define what success is

00:12:32.578 --> 00:12:41.639
Caption: right at the moment success is replace

00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:43.739
Caption: XYZ Legacy system with project insanity

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.720
Caption: and all will be well

00:12:43.739 --> 00:12:47.940
Caption: replacement of a system is not a

00:12:45.719 --> 00:12:51.000
Caption: definition of success

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.440
Caption: for success to happen it&#39;s got to be

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.820
Caption: measurable

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:58.619
Caption: so this is the success maybe people are

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:02.160
Caption: now more efficient

00:12:58.619 --> 00:13:05.039
Caption: that the organization makes more money

00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:07.500
Caption: that we can do more with less

00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:08.518
Caption: whatever it is but it has to be

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.039
Caption: measurable

00:13:08.518 --> 00:13:14.159
Caption: replacing a legacy system with something

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:16.199
Caption: new is not a definition of success and

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:18.000
Caption: in this scenario sure you can go and

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.119
Caption: create something new but it won&#39;t work

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.398
Caption: it won&#39;t be successful because the

00:13:21.119 --> 00:13:24.898
Caption: people aren&#39;t involved because the

00:13:23.398 --> 00:13:27.380
Caption: organization doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re

00:13:24.898 --> 00:13:27.380
Caption: getting into

00:13:27.778 --> 00:13:35.778
Caption: next thing project management 101 have a

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:39.119
Caption: plan we all know the old adage plan

00:13:35.778 --> 00:13:42.479
Caption: failed to plan and you plan to fail in

00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:45.719
Caption: this scenario that is so true the plan

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:47.880
Caption: will need to be really really robust

00:13:45.719 --> 00:13:49.979
Caption: and the schedule needs to Encompass

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.660
Caption: everything that you know needs to happen

00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:55.699
Caption: not just what they think needs to happen

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:55.699
Caption: but what you know needs to happen

00:13:55.919 --> 00:14:01.919
Caption: and then once you&#39;ve done that and this

00:13:58.799 --> 00:14:04.739
Caption: is the most critical step

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:06.958
Caption: is to actually run a risk workshop with

00:14:04.739 --> 00:14:09.599
Caption: all the key stakeholders

00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:12.419
Caption: you need to get them in a room and help

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:15.599
Caption: them to identify all the risks and you

00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:17.820
Caption: need to be very very granular so we

00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:19.679
Caption: can&#39;t have a risk that says resources

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:22.919
Caption: aren&#39;t available

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:26.219
Caption: the risk has to be we can&#39;t get the

00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:30.359
Caption: resources from Finance when we need them

00:14:26.219 --> 00:14:34.679
Caption: to be able to do whatever it is or the

00:14:30.359 --> 00:14:37.919
Caption: BAU I.T resources get pulled off onto

00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:39.359
Caption: BAU activities and off the project all

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:40.979
Caption: of those are different risks and you

00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:43.739
Caption: need a different risk for every single

00:14:40.979 --> 00:14:45.599
Caption: resource issue and the reason you need a

00:14:43.739 --> 00:14:48.419
Caption: different risk is is that you then need

00:14:45.599 --> 00:14:50.638
Caption: to get an owner for all of those risks

00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:52.859
Caption: so the owner for the one about the

00:14:50.638 --> 00:14:54.898
Caption: finance people would be the finance

00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:57.958
Caption: manager the owner for the one about the

00:14:54.898 --> 00:14:59.698
Caption: IT people would be the it manager

00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:02.219
Caption: and then

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:04.259
Caption: more important still they have to take

00:15:02.219 --> 00:15:07.259
Caption: some action to make sure that it is

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:10.139
Caption: mitigated so Define the risks identify

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.359
Caption: the mitigation and the owner and then

00:15:10.138 --> 00:15:14.398
Caption: make it happen

00:15:12.359 --> 00:15:16.320
Caption: and then you can come up with a budget

00:15:14.398 --> 00:15:17.479
Caption: because we&#39;ve just doubled the cost of

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.619
Caption: this project

00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:21.719
Caption: with the schedule that I would have come

00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:22.440
Caption: up with in this particular scenario at

00:15:21.719 --> 00:15:25.259
Caption: least

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.880
Caption: in order to make it work agree the

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:29.160
Caption: budget if you can&#39;t get agreement on the

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.859
Caption: budget which includes backfilling your

00:15:29.159 --> 00:15:34.859
Caption: BAU resources or whatever it is

00:15:31.859 --> 00:15:37.619
Caption: great time to walk away

00:15:34.859 --> 00:15:38.940
Caption: because it won&#39;t succeed it will go over

00:15:37.619 --> 00:15:41.039
Caption: budget and then everyone will be

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:43.138
Caption: screaming at you

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:44.518
Caption: and and bear in mind I&#39;m taking this

00:15:43.138 --> 00:15:46.919
Caption: from the perspective of a project

00:15:44.518 --> 00:15:49.500
Caption: manager but even as a team member on the

00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:51.599
Caption: team you can help identify those risks

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:54.479
Caption: and help to work to mitigate those risks

00:15:51.599 --> 00:15:55.799
Caption: and to you know take ownership of some

00:15:54.479 --> 00:15:58.380
Caption: of those risks so it&#39;s not just the

00:15:55.799 --> 00:16:01.260
Caption: project manager and the project manager

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.458
Caption: cannot own the risks they must be owned

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.160
Caption: by someone who could do something about

00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:07.260
Caption: it so I&#39;ve seen project risk schedules

00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:11.059
Caption: this big the owner of all of them&#39;s the

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.059
Caption: project manager still won&#39;t work

00:16:11.219 --> 00:16:15.299
Caption: and there&#39;s a whole load of others which

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:17.759
Caption: I don&#39;t really have time to do deal with

00:16:15.299 --> 00:16:20.099
Caption: but um you know agree rays of working

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.859
Caption: engage the business you got to talk to

00:16:20.099 --> 00:16:27.380
Caption: them demonstrate bad ux and get the

00:16:22.859 --> 00:16:27.380
Caption: people who who are on site to see it

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:33.479
Caption: so I&#39;ll leave you with two things the

00:16:29.578 --> 00:16:37.018
Caption: first is is that it projects rarely fail

00:16:33.479 --> 00:16:39.958
Caption: because of the technology

00:16:37.018 --> 00:16:43.138
Caption: IT projects generally fail because of

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:46.799
Caption: all of the things around it it&#39;s the

00:16:43.138 --> 00:16:48.838
Caption: people and process and money aspects

00:16:46.799 --> 00:16:50.578
Caption: that make it fail so we&#39;re talking

00:16:48.838 --> 00:16:52.018
Caption: people we&#39;re talking the resourcing

00:16:50.578 --> 00:16:54.898
Caption: we&#39;re talking the business engagement

00:16:52.018 --> 00:16:57.419
Caption: money is obvious the funding one and the

00:16:54.898 --> 00:16:59.518
Caption: process how decisions are made how

00:16:57.419 --> 00:17:02.219
Caption: you&#39;re going to work on the project if

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:04.260
Caption: you don&#39;t get all of those things right

00:17:02.219 --> 00:17:07.140
Caption: that&#39;s what will cause the project to

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:09.540
Caption: fail not the lack of the technology to

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.640
Caption: do its job because we&#39;ve got some really

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.919
Caption: really clever technical folk out here

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:17.299
Caption: who can make it work and they&#39;ll always

00:17:13.918 --> 00:17:17.298
Caption: overcome those challenges

00:17:18.058 --> 00:17:23.938
Caption: and at the end of the day the

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:27.720
Caption: stakeholders need to acknowledge that

00:17:23.938 --> 00:17:31.500
Caption: the is there are risks they need to

00:17:27.719 --> 00:17:35.579
Caption: accept ownership for those risks

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:37.699
Caption: and then they need to action those risks

00:17:35.579 --> 00:17:40.319
Caption: and if you can get them to do all that

00:17:37.699 --> 00:17:42.959
Caption: you&#39;ve got the best possible chance of

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:45.599
Caption: success in this scenario you still might

00:17:42.959 --> 00:17:48.239
Caption: not you still might fail but it&#39;ll give

00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:50.079
Caption: you the best possible chance of success

00:17:48.239 --> 00:17:53.079
Caption: thank you

00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:56.219
Caption: [Applause]

00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:56.219
Caption: [Music]

00:17:57.719 --> 00:18:02.339
Caption: thank you so much for that amazing talk

00:17:59.939 --> 00:18:04.500
Caption: I know that I&#39;ve definitely learned a

00:18:02.339 --> 00:18:06.239
Caption: few things I&#39;ll be on the lookout in the

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:11.058
Caption: next project that I&#39;m joining in

00:18:06.239 --> 00:18:11.058
Caption: hopefully not quite as many red flags
