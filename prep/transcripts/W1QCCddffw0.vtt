00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.040
Caption: knowledge that we have

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:15.779

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:17.039
Caption: been pretty well known and in the east

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:19.500
Caption: coast we&#39;ve been around for about 15

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:22.439
Caption: years but the Perth branch has only

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.619
Caption: launched in August of 2021 so it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.020
Caption: reasonably new uh for Perth at least

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:29.039
Caption: so the Great War for technology is upon

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.900
Caption: us

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:33.119
Caption: and it&#39;s been upon us for some time now

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:35.519
Caption: but the game has definitely changed in

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:38.539
Caption: order to combat closed borders uh

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.400
Caption: restricted travel and just a generally

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:44.159
Caption: adverse attitude towards changing jobs

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:45.958
Caption: amid a pandemic as you&#39;d expect the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.958
Caption: Perth technology Market has really had

00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:50.819
Caption: to undergo an evolution in terms of

00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:53.098
Caption: talent

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.139
Caption: um and serbian&#39;s no different from any

00:02:53.098 --> 00:02:56.598
Caption: other business in the room you know the

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.220
Caption: main challenge for a lot of businesses

00:02:56.598 --> 00:03:01.679
Caption: pretty much all technology businesses in

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.040
Caption: Perth is how do we attract and retain

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:06.839
Caption: the best possible talent in the market

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.279
Caption: as a business we&#39;re still working on

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:10.800
Caption: this we&#39;re still fine-tuning this

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:12.720
Caption: process but there&#39;s a number of talent

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.598
Caption: acquisition strategies that we&#39;ve put in

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.300
Caption: place over the last 12 or so months to

00:03:15.598 --> 00:03:20.458
Caption: grow from a team of four to a team of 31

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.518
Caption: technical consultants working with some

00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:25.800
Caption: of the latest in Cloud technology

00:03:23.518 --> 00:03:28.259
Caption: I walked into the serving office in

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.720
Caption: August of 2021

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:32.039
Caption: um I probably didn&#39;t do my due diligence

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.378
Caption: at the time and didn&#39;t actually realize

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:36.479
Caption: how small the team was so I walked into

00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:38.458
Caption: the building and one of the principal

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.839
Caption: Consultants said Yep this is it all four

00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:41.458
Caption: of us

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.259
Caption: great

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:45.238
Caption: um so at that point I really I knew two

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:48.720
Caption: things one I wasn&#39;t going to be made

00:03:45.238 --> 00:03:50.518
Caption: redundant anytime soon and two we&#39;ve got

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.738
Caption: a lot of work ahead of us

00:03:50.518 --> 00:03:55.679
Caption: I was essentially tasked with building

00:03:52.738 --> 00:03:57.000
Caption: the per team from the ground up the

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:58.559
Caption: regional partner at the time had

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.779
Caption: basically said to me look if you can

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:03.419
Caption: find a couple of you know software

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:06.720
Caption: professionals or devops engineers in the

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:08.158
Caption: first 12 months great fantastic now I&#39;d

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.738
Caption: heard along the Grapevine that our

00:04:08.158 --> 00:04:12.598
Caption: Brisbane office had gone from zero to 65

00:04:10.738 --> 00:04:15.059
Caption: technical consultants in about three

00:04:12.598 --> 00:04:17.279
Caption: years I was not gonna let Brisbane beat

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:19.679
Caption: me apparently recruiters by Nature are

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:22.220
Caption: very competitive people

00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:24.299
Caption: um so yeah look you know 12 months later

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.179
Caption: we&#39;ve been able to successfully build a

00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:29.099
Caption: team of 31 technical consultants across

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:31.739
Caption: data engineering devops engineering

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.059
Caption: Cloud engineering cyber security and

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:35.039
Caption: software development

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:37.079
Caption: so again why is this presentation every

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.460
Caption: relevant to everybody in the room well

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:39.659
Caption: all we have to do is just look at seek

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:41.579
Caption: and look at some of the adverts that are

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.619
Caption: currently advertised

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:45.359
Caption: now before we get stuck in let&#39;s just

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:47.160
Caption: take a second to have a look at the

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:49.559
Caption: Perth market in terms of the Perth

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.320
Caption: technology Market please keep in mind

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:54.059
Caption: that this was a study that I did

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.740
Caption: actually with thank you to the Robert

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:58.259
Caption: Walters team who helped me with some of

00:04:55.739 --> 00:05:00.119
Caption: the insights but this is based on

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:03.179
Caption: statistics that are only available on

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:04.619
Caption: LinkedIn so if a person hasn&#39;t got their

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:07.699
Caption: profile on LinkedIn they&#39;re obviously

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:07.699
Caption: not included in the study

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:15.660
Caption: so according to LinkedIn we have

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:17.698
Caption: 3241 software Professionals in Perth

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.899
Caption: so that&#39;s not a whole heap much to my

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.119
Caption: disappointment and probably everyone&#39;s

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:23.039
Caption: disappointment software developers don&#39;t

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:24.139
Caption: grow on trees

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.360
Caption: um of the

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:30.960
Caption: 3241 software Professionals in Perth in

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:34.019
Caption: the last 12 months we&#39;ve had 749 change

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:35.160
Caption: job which is about 23 of the Perth

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:38.160
Caption: Market

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.679
Caption: 16 of the Perth software professional

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.080
Caption: Market identifies female and the average

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:44.279
Caption: tenure with any organization is one and

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:47.459
Caption: a half years

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:49.679
Caption: this is just a quick breakdown on the

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:52.440
Caption: actual dynamics of the um the software

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:54.720
Caption: Dev market so we&#39;ve got about 2 000

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.699
Caption: software developers about 700 or so

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.399
Caption: senior software engineers and a couple

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.800
Caption: of other positions in there as well

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:03.539
Caption: let&#39;s have a look at data engineers

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:06.359
Caption: so again these stats are only based on

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.079
Caption: what&#39;s actually out there on LinkedIn

00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:09.299
Caption: um

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:13.019
Caption: so you can see here that we&#39;ve got a

00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:14.698
Caption: total of 263 data Engineers senior data

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:16.679
Caption: engineers and other related data

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:21.300
Caption: professional titles in the market

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:23.039
Caption: of the 263 94 have changed jobs in the

00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:26.940
Caption: last 12 months which is pretty

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:29.519
Caption: staggering that&#39;s 35 36 percent of the

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.339
Caption: entire Market has moved job within data

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:34.138
Caption: Engineering in the last 12 months

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:36.899
Caption: um diversity probably fares slightly

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.539
Caption: better with 26 of the market identifying

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:42.059
Caption: as female and again the average median

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:44.220
Caption: tenature with any organization is one

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:46.859
Caption: and a half years

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.720
Caption: uh this is a scary one we&#39;ve only got 52

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:50.339
Caption: senior data engineers in Perth I feel

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.600
Caption: like there&#39;s something wrong with that

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.819
Caption: but

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.440
Caption: um lastly we&#39;ll have a look at another

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.679
Caption: really challenging skill set to hire in

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.899
Caption: Perth which is cloud professionals

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:02.639
Caption: so again according to LinkedIn the cloud

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:05.519
Caption: technology Market tells us that there

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:07.199
Caption: are 253 Cloud technology professionals

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:11.279
Caption: listed on LinkedIn

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:13.380
Caption: of the 253 C 69 have changed job in the

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:15.779
Caption: past 12 months 12 of the market

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.880
Caption: identifies female and again the the

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:20.660
Caption: median tenure with an organization is

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.660
Caption: one and a half years

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:27.839
Caption: so what does this tell us about the tech

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:30.598
Caption: Market in Perth

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:32.639
Caption: it&#39;s pretty tight it&#39;s pretty tight I

00:07:30.598 --> 00:07:34.079
Caption: think that we can all agree that you

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.580
Caption: know we&#39;re all hiring these skill sets

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:37.019
Caption: they&#39;re all very similar sorts of skill

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:38.339
Caption: sets we&#39;re all doing really interesting

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:39.899
Caption: projects

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:41.759
Caption: um so naturally we&#39;re all looking for

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:43.199
Caption: the same sorts of professionals to help

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:46.580
Caption: us on that Journey

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:46.580
Caption: so how do we overcome this challenge

00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:51.359
Caption: maths and relationships

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:54.720
Caption: so back when I first started in

00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:58.198
Caption: recruitment my boss at the time Jody

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.479
Caption: hi she told me that the math doesn&#39;t lie

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:02.399
Caption: when it comes to recruitment now when I

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:04.139
Caption: was 23 years old and was six months into

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:06.239
Caption: recruitment didn&#39;t really believe it too

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:08.160
Caption: much but looking back on it now that

00:08:06.239 --> 00:08:09.779
Caption: I&#39;ve matured a little bit more I very

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.819
Caption: much believe that effective recruitment

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:14.759
Caption: in today&#39;s market especially in Perth

00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:18.000
Caption: consists of two really key elements and

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:20.639
Caption: that is maths and relationships

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.959
Caption: but Ryan how does maths relate to

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:23.759
Caption: recruitment don&#39;t you just call people

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:24.779
Caption: up and ask them about opportunities and

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:26.878
Caption: jobs

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:29.399
Caption: it&#39;s a great question

00:08:26.878 --> 00:08:30.839
Caption: so I&#39;d be interested to hear maybe some

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:32.520
Caption: stats from the people in the crowd

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:34.799
Caption: especially recruiters and and talent

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.360
Caption: acquisition specialists in the room

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.739
Caption: um maybe at a later date but look for

00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:39.658
Caption: the time being I&#39;m happy to use my

00:08:37.739 --> 00:08:41.098
Caption: statistics with Serbian as a bit of an

00:08:39.658 --> 00:08:44.458
Caption: example

00:08:41.098 --> 00:08:48.119
Caption: so in the last 12 months Serbian Perth

00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:49.500
Caption: has had 1 210 applications across a

00:08:48.119 --> 00:08:51.679
Caption: number of different professions so

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:55.940
Caption: software development data engineering

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:55.940
Caption: devops cloud and cyber security

00:08:56.039 --> 00:09:02.398
Caption: of those 1210 applications will take 243

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.260
Caption: through to the first round of interview

00:09:02.398 --> 00:09:05.940
Caption: 90 will make it through to the technical

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.700
Caption: exercise that we have so we we get

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:11.278
Caption: everyone to undergo a technical exercise

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:14.760
Caption: and of the 220 that take the exercise

00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:16.679
Caption: only 118 will pass

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.540
Caption: 118 will go through to the second round

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:20.159
Caption: of interview which is with one of our

00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:21.958
Caption: principal Consultants

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:23.639
Caption: 61 making it through to the final round

00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:26.219
Caption: of interview

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:29.338
Caption: so it brings us to a grand total of 39

00:09:26.219 --> 00:09:32.699
Caption: being offered and 28 accepting

00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:34.979
Caption: so what does the maths tell us so look

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.320
Caption: let&#39;s work it back let&#39;s let&#39;s look at

00:09:34.979 --> 00:09:40.559
Caption: what does it take to hire 28 talented

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:43.398
Caption: technologists across a 12-month period

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:45.838
Caption: I&#39;ll need to speak to roughly

00:09:43.398 --> 00:09:48.000
Caption: 25.521 candidates a week which is

00:09:45.838 --> 00:09:50.700
Caption: roughly five candidates a day

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.760
Caption: I need to interview 5.06 qualified

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:56.398
Caption: candidates a week one a day

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.739
Caption: I need to have at least 2.46 candidates

00:09:56.398 --> 00:10:01.200
Caption: at a second round interview

00:09:58.739 --> 00:10:02.958
Caption: and 1.27 candidates at a final round

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.640
Caption: interview

00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:07.799
Caption: so in order to hire two or three

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.600
Caption: candidates per month

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:11.398
Caption: um that&#39;s sort of what we need to do in

00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:12.958
Caption: terms of process from an interview and

00:10:11.398 --> 00:10:14.518
Caption: recruitment point of view

00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958
Caption: now if you&#39;re wondering you know we&#39;ve

00:10:14.518 --> 00:10:18.059
Caption: got a talent acquisition team we&#39;ve got

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.559
Caption: a recruitment team maybe why are they

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:21.299
Caption: not looking at or why they&#39;re not

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:23.338
Caption: getting the same sorts of results

00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:25.500
Caption: um from my internal team I&#39;d probably

00:10:23.338 --> 00:10:26.580
Caption: encourage you just to have a look at I

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.159
Caption: suppose working it backwards and

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.200
Caption: re-engineering that process

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:34.018
Caption: um you know looking at how efficient how

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.059
Caption: effective that process is and hopefully

00:10:34.018 --> 00:10:38.278
Caption: the answers should lie in there for you

00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:40.080
Caption: now in addition to this we&#39;ve

00:10:38.278 --> 00:10:43.619
Caption: highlighted just how

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.600
Caption: tight the Perth Market can be so we need

00:10:43.619 --> 00:10:48.380
Caption: to really be thinking about how our

00:10:45.599 --> 00:10:51.719
Caption: brand is engaging with those

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:54.299
Caption: 3241 software developers in Perth how am

00:10:51.719 --> 00:10:56.458
Caption: I managing relationships with the 263

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:59.219
Caption: data Engineers or how am I being

00:10:56.458 --> 00:11:01.940
Caption: perceived by the 253 Cloud Professionals

00:10:59.219 --> 00:11:01.939
Caption: in Perth

00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:05.820
Caption: so we know what the challenges are

00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:07.739
Caption: finding talents really hard

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.539
Caption: through the pandemic there&#39;s been some

00:11:07.739 --> 00:11:10.940
Caption: real constraints around the movement of

00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:13.380
Caption: human capital

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.239
Caption: and now that things are sort of returned

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.578
Caption: to a level of normality

00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:19.500
Caption: yeah I don&#39;t know about you but 263 data

00:11:17.578 --> 00:11:22.199
Caption: engineers in Perth is that&#39;s just not

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:24.059
Caption: enough as according to LinkedIn so the

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.739
Caption: challenge for us is how do we open up

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:28.919
Caption: this talent pool how do we how do we

00:11:25.739 --> 00:11:30.479
Caption: widen the market that we currently have

00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:33.539
Caption: so

00:11:30.479 --> 00:11:37.018
Caption: let&#39;s explore Interstate Talent

00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:40.440
Caption: um Perth is a pretty cool place to live

00:11:37.018 --> 00:11:42.299
Caption: reasonably I suppose

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.338
Caption: the standard of living is is pretty good

00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:46.559
Caption: house prices aren&#39;t the same as what

00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:47.760
Caption: they are in Sydney so seratoway I think

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:51.119
Caption: we&#39;ve got some really good things going

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.540
Caption: for us as a state I reckon I would have

00:11:51.119 --> 00:11:53.539
Caption: probably

00:11:53.578 --> 00:11:58.380
Caption: one in ten candidates come through the

00:11:55.979 --> 00:11:59.398
Caption: process that will come from Melbourne or

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.958
Caption: Sydney

00:11:59.398 --> 00:12:02.159
Caption: um and they&#39;ll come to us with the

00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.078
Caption: reasons of

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:06.119
Caption: Perth is a great place to live it&#39;s a

00:12:04.078 --> 00:12:07.919
Caption: great place to raise a family I can

00:12:06.119 --> 00:12:10.619
Caption: afford a house that&#39;s a really good

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:11.940
Caption: start in addition to that

00:12:10.619 --> 00:12:13.260
Caption: um you know let&#39;s look at maybe some of

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.640
Caption: the um the skilled migrants that we

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.458
Caption: could potentially explore

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.420
Caption: so earlier this year the West Australian

00:12:17.458 --> 00:12:20.880
Caption: government and the federal government

00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:23.099
Caption: put in place some changes to the

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.200
Caption: legislation around easing of movement

00:12:23.099 --> 00:12:27.958
Caption: for skilled migrants so the Perth Metro

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.359
Caption: region was essentially reclassified as a

00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.859
Caption: regional area so this has really opened

00:12:30.359 --> 00:12:34.380
Caption: the door for a number of different

00:12:31.859 --> 00:12:36.119
Caption: migrants from all over the country who

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.739
Caption: are Keen to work in Australia but are

00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:39.000
Caption: obviously limited with regards to

00:12:37.739 --> 00:12:39.838
Caption: Opportunities

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.419
Caption: um

00:12:39.838 --> 00:12:44.518
Caption: and it&#39;s an interesting thing to think

00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:46.078
Caption: about prior to this you know yes you

00:12:44.518 --> 00:12:48.359
Caption: could potentially come and work in in

00:12:46.078 --> 00:12:49.859
Caption: Perth as a devops engineer but you&#39;d

00:12:48.359 --> 00:12:51.239
Caption: have to go and work in the bush

00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:53.099
Caption: wouldn&#39;t really make a lot of sense

00:12:51.239 --> 00:12:54.898
Caption: especially you know when you&#39;re trying

00:12:53.099 --> 00:12:57.419
Caption: to build collaborative teams

00:12:54.898 --> 00:13:00.778
Caption: so the changes made by the wa government

00:12:57.419 --> 00:13:02.458
Caption: basically enabled priority processing of

00:13:00.778 --> 00:13:05.099
Caption: regional visas and Perth has now been

00:13:02.458 --> 00:13:06.838
Caption: reclassified as a regional Zone

00:13:05.099 --> 00:13:08.518
Caption: um in addition to that access to

00:13:06.838 --> 00:13:10.559
Caption: Regional occupations list which has

00:13:08.518 --> 00:13:11.578
Caption: obviously been opened out so there&#39;s

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:13.700
Caption: more jobs that have actually been

00:13:11.578 --> 00:13:17.219
Caption: included on that list of potential

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.898
Caption: employability so as a result of this I

00:13:17.219 --> 00:13:20.939
Caption: found we&#39;ve had a real influx of people

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:22.260
Caption: looking to actually Fast Track some of

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.398
Caption: their visas

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.018
Caption: um you know in Melbourne and Sydney

00:13:23.398 --> 00:13:27.539
Caption: people can be waiting upwards of six to

00:13:25.018 --> 00:13:29.578
Caption: nine months for a potential Visa but

00:13:27.539 --> 00:13:31.559
Caption: with the West Australian government

00:13:29.578 --> 00:13:33.719
Caption: sending out invitations to apply for the

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:36.059
Caption: 190 Visa they really are trying to drive

00:13:33.719 --> 00:13:37.379
Caption: a lot of people you know getting across

00:13:36.059 --> 00:13:40.219
Caption: the state or getting across the country

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.220
Caption: into wa

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:44.940
Caption: so whilst we&#39;re on the topic of

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:47.278
Caption: international candidates or people

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:50.638
Caption: relocating I had a really good

00:13:47.278 --> 00:13:52.260
Caption: interesting conversation with one of our

00:13:50.638 --> 00:13:54.898
Caption: senior devops Engineers who&#39;s just

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.578
Caption: joined us not so long ago

00:13:54.898 --> 00:13:59.179
Caption: um I was asking sort of about his

00:13:56.578 --> 00:14:02.940
Caption: experience and just a bit of context so

00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:05.700
Caption: gcp AWS like five or six years of

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.138
Caption: experience just a brilliant guy

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.059
Caption: um you know a skill set that is really

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:11.940
Caption: highly in demand especially in the Perth

00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:14.338
Caption: Market but really any market and I was

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.979
Caption: talking to him about his his

00:14:14.338 --> 00:14:18.898
Caption: um how he felt about our process and you

00:14:16.979 --> 00:14:20.458
Caption: know I put the question to him of were

00:14:18.898 --> 00:14:22.380
Caption: you interviewing with anybody else any

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:24.239
Caption: other organizations in Australia when

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:27.000
Caption: you were looking to make the move and he

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:30.539
Caption: said to me that he&#39;d applied for 51 51

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:34.078
Caption: positions and he&#39;d heard back from two

00:14:30.539 --> 00:14:36.299
Caption: which is us who snagged him and there

00:14:34.078 --> 00:14:39.018
Caption: was one other organization in Melbourne

00:14:36.299 --> 00:14:41.278
Caption: so this is a devops and Cloud

00:14:39.018 --> 00:14:43.078
Caption: professional who&#39;s applied for devops

00:14:41.278 --> 00:14:45.359
Caption: and Cloud related positions and he&#39;s

00:14:43.078 --> 00:14:47.719
Caption: only heard back from two organizations

00:14:45.359 --> 00:14:50.099
Caption: so I think like this is a really

00:14:47.719 --> 00:14:51.659
Caption: old-school way of thinking

00:14:50.099 --> 00:14:53.819

00:15:51.778 --> 00:15:55.739
Caption: look at this you know in the grand

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:57.599
Caption: scheme of things you break that 14 Grand

00:15:55.739 --> 00:15:59.518

00:15:57.599 --> 00:16:02.940
Caption: dollars a year across a four year period

00:15:59.518 --> 00:16:04.979
Caption: straight away we also I suppose we we

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.898
Caption: fight back against two of the really key

00:16:04.979 --> 00:16:08.398
Caption: challenges that we&#39;re facing as an

00:16:06.898 --> 00:16:10.198
Caption: industry which is broadening out that

00:16:08.398 --> 00:16:13.198
Caption: talent pool outside of just Perth and wa

00:16:10.198 --> 00:16:16.018
Caption: and we also beat the um the median

00:16:13.198 --> 00:16:18.000
Caption: tenure with an organization because the

00:16:16.018 --> 00:16:19.380
Caption: market dictates people stay with an

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.198
Caption: organization for one and a half years

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.359
Caption: the Visa obviously we&#39;re investing in

00:16:22.198 --> 00:16:26.518
Caption: them they&#39;re investing in us with us for

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:28.859
Caption: a period of about four years or so so

00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:30.838
Caption: it&#39;s a really handy thing to look into

00:16:28.859 --> 00:16:33.239
Caption: now this is an important one

00:16:30.838 --> 00:16:35.698
Caption: Talent attracts Talent

00:16:33.239 --> 00:16:37.559
Caption: so you know in order to sort of attract

00:16:35.698 --> 00:16:40.018
Caption: good talent we need to understand what

00:16:37.559 --> 00:16:41.278
Caption: motivates Talent now how do we do this

00:16:40.018 --> 00:16:43.919
Caption: it&#39;s pretty easy

00:16:41.278 --> 00:16:45.719
Caption: honest transparent conversations with

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:48.179
Caption: our distinguished technologists about

00:16:45.719 --> 00:16:50.398
Caption: what they&#39;re doing what they want to do

00:16:48.179 --> 00:16:52.198
Caption: and how we can put a roadmap and a

00:16:50.398 --> 00:16:53.578
Caption: strategy together to get them where they

00:16:52.198 --> 00:16:55.258
Caption: want to go

00:16:53.578 --> 00:16:56.458
Caption: once we understand you know what our

00:16:55.258 --> 00:16:58.379
Caption: people want to do in their experience

00:16:56.458 --> 00:17:00.179
Caption: with the business we can put these

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.160
Caption: things in place and we really want to

00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:03.778
Caption: empower them to be ambassadors for our

00:17:02.159 --> 00:17:05.400
Caption: business

00:17:03.778 --> 00:17:06.660
Caption: um another really important aspect of

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.640
Caption: this is being able to provide a

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.319
Caption: financial incentive

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.479
Caption: um this should always come in a monetary

00:17:10.318 --> 00:17:14.698
Caption: form and the successful referral of

00:17:12.479 --> 00:17:17.219
Caption: candidates to our business at all levels

00:17:14.698 --> 00:17:18.958
Caption: of seniority attracts an 8 000 referral

00:17:17.219 --> 00:17:21.479
Caption: bonus

00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:24.000
Caption: um which I find is well and truly enough

00:17:21.479 --> 00:17:26.938
Caption: to motivate people to have conversations

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.859
Caption: with old colleagues and and get people

00:17:26.938 --> 00:17:31.619
Caption: to flick me the CV and have a just a

00:17:28.859 --> 00:17:34.199
Caption: general conversation

00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:36.719
Caption: so if we&#39;re recruiting for technologists

00:17:34.199 --> 00:17:38.880
Caption: in Perth whether we like it or not we&#39;re

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.099

00:18:01.739 --> 00:18:06.119
Caption: at the moment and recruiters love

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.739

Caption: Talent at the moment

00:18:07.739 --> 00:18:12.418
Caption: I fundamentally believe this statement&#39;s

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.900
Caption: wrong it&#39;s actually not that hard it&#39;s

00:18:12.418 --> 00:18:17.159
Caption: challenging yes it&#39;s not easy at times

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.320
Caption: but if you actually take the time to

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.419
Caption: think outside of the box you know adopt

00:18:19.319 --> 00:18:22.798
Caption: different ways of doing things and

00:18:21.418 --> 00:18:24.178
Caption: change the way that you&#39;re approaching

00:18:22.798 --> 00:18:27.439

Caption: um that&#39;s a really big one like for us

00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:27.418
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:19:25.619 --> 00:19:28.678
Caption: about problem solving you know it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:19:27.418 --> 00:19:30.538
Caption: the ability to be able to break

00:19:28.678 --> 00:19:32.640
Caption: something down and logically work

00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:34.379
Caption: through it to come up with a solution so

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.058
Caption: that&#39;s a really big green light the

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.280
Caption: other one&#39;s sort of passion for what

00:19:36.058 --> 00:19:39.479
Caption: they&#39;re doing so don&#39;t show me about

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.979
Caption: don&#39;t tell me about stuff that you&#39;re

00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:42.660
Caption: doing in work tell me about the stuff

00:19:40.979 --> 00:19:43.918
Caption: you&#39;re doing outside of work um because

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.679
Caption: that&#39;s obviously where passion shines

00:19:43.918 --> 00:19:49.219
Caption: through and communication is the other

00:19:46.678 --> 00:19:49.219
Caption: really key one

00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:01.039
Caption: become some recruiters give other

00:19:58.439 --> 00:20:01.038
Caption: recruiters

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:07.700
Caption: and yeah can we say like not all

00:20:03.418 --> 00:20:07.699
Caption: recruiters but what do you think is

00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:12.119
Caption: good

00:20:09.418 --> 00:20:15.959
Caption: and what do you think

00:20:12.119 --> 00:20:18.959
Caption: oh good question I&#39;ve met both I like to

00:20:15.959 --> 00:20:21.058
Caption: think I&#39;m one over the other

00:20:18.959 --> 00:20:22.678
Caption: um what makes a good tech recruiter is

00:20:21.058 --> 00:20:23.640
Caption: someone that&#39;s not looking to close a

00:20:22.678 --> 00:20:26.038
Caption: sale

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.719
Caption: I think that&#39;s a really big one

00:20:26.038 --> 00:20:29.159
Caption: um so yeah someone that&#39;s not looking to

00:20:27.719 --> 00:20:31.500
Caption: close a sale someone that&#39;s looking to

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.239
Caption: build relationships over the long term

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.280
Caption: um and put the candidate first that&#39;s

00:20:33.239 --> 00:20:37.380
Caption: that&#39;s going to be the main like the

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.520
Caption: number one thing and I think that&#39;s the

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.500
Caption: trouble with recruitment because it&#39;s

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.558
Caption: Recruitment and sort of sales as well so

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:46.439
Caption: sometimes the sales aspect can be to

00:20:43.558 --> 00:20:48.599
Caption: detriment of the candidate what makes a

00:20:46.439 --> 00:20:51.418
Caption: bad recruiter someone that doesn&#39;t do

00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:53.459
Caption: that someone that pings you know 100

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:55.859
Caption: messages out on LinkedIn just to try and

00:20:53.459 --> 00:20:56.520
Caption: take a bit of a phishing approach

00:20:55.859 --> 00:20:59.119
Caption: um

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.119
Caption: yeah

00:21:13.819 --> 00:21:19.558
Caption: and they have a certain budget

00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:22.939
Caption: what in your opinion how should they

00:21:19.558 --> 00:21:22.939
Caption: what what&#39;s the best way for

00:21:23.939 --> 00:21:26.239
Caption: eign

00:21:39.359 --> 00:21:43.140
Caption: best return on investment for driving

00:21:41.579 --> 00:21:45.178
Caption: recruitment

Caption: um like we we take the approach of

00:21:47.579 --> 00:21:51.058
Caption: you know the the best candidate is the

00:21:49.439 --> 00:21:53.099
Caption: best candidate doesn&#39;t matter how they

00:21:51.058 --> 00:21:54.779
Caption: come we want to try and enable as many

00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:57.239
Caption: channels as possible to open that up

00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:00.359
Caption: every business is going to be different

00:21:57.239 --> 00:22:01.859
Caption: um I&#39;m a big fan of investing in the TA

00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:03.780
Caption: team internally

00:22:01.859 --> 00:22:05.579

Caption: from what I found they can do the job of

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.059
Caption: three agencies combined because they

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.079

Caption: on a little bit more of a personal level

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.539
Caption: at least that&#39;s what I found you know

00:22:19.319 --> 00:22:24.839
Caption: when I started at Serbian there was a

00:22:21.538 --> 00:22:26.879
Caption: big shift in mindset from agency to

00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:44.460
