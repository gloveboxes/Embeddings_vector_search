Caption: before we do go any further I would

00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:48.959
Caption: really like for us to just pause and to

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:51.419

Caption: indigenous land

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:24.719

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.180
Caption: encourage you to just take this moment

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:41.458
Caption: to also consider the people of the

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:44.719
Caption: culture and the culture of the land that

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:44.720

Caption: in this room so I want to talk to you a

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.878
Caption: little bit about my career Journey

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.860
Caption: because it&#39;s not probably the most

00:03:11.878 --> 00:03:16.080
Caption: typical career Journey you would take to

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.639
Caption: become a developer and then from there

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.900
Caption: we&#39;re going to go into how did all the

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.658
Caption: teaching and mentoring that I&#39;ve done

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:23.458
Caption: help me to become a better developer

00:03:21.658 --> 00:03:24.720
Caption: and from that what are the tips and

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:26.699
Caption: tricks that I&#39;ve learned to help you

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.860
Caption: become an Effective Teacher or Mentor

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:31.440
Caption: while you&#39;re also working as a Dev or

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.300
Caption: just in Tech in general and how does all

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.779
Caption: of this come together to help us improve

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.819
Caption: the diversity in our industry

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:42.298
Caption: so let me tell you a little bit about my

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.518
Caption: career and where I am today so at the

00:03:42.298 --> 00:03:46.619
Caption: moment I am a senior engineer and

00:03:44.518 --> 00:03:49.500
Caption: developer Mentor at envato

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:51.119
Caption: has anybody heard of envato

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.798
Caption: yeah we&#39;ve got shocking brand

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:54.720
Caption: recognition recognition we&#39;re trying to

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:58.559
Caption: do something about it but basically we

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.319
Caption: sell uh well we provide stock footage or

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:03.298
Caption: photos or fonts or presentations we

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.098
Caption: basically create and sell creative stock

00:04:03.298 --> 00:04:07.979
Caption: so even if you haven&#39;t heard of us you

00:04:05.098 --> 00:04:09.298
Caption: have definitely seen us being used and

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:11.279
Caption: we support

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:13.199
Caption: thousands of authors around the world

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:15.119
Caption: who might be photographers or make

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.220
Caption: really cool animations and whatnot and

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:19.079
Caption: we sell their what they create on our

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.760
Caption: platforms and so far we have paid

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.440
Caption: millions and millions of dollars towards

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.180
Caption: authors and we have supported thousands

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.360
Caption: and thousands of creators

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:29.100
Caption: so we are big on community which is

00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:31.918
Caption: probably why I work there because the

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.360
Caption: values align really closely to mine but

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.339
Caption: also I work there because I have a

00:04:33.359 --> 00:04:38.399
Caption: really cool job so I&#39;m a developer

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:41.040
Caption: Mentor which means that we hire

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:42.660
Caption: Apprentice developers and they get to

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.940
Caption: spend nine months with me or another

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.399
Caption: developer Mentor just training and

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.160
Caption: learning how to become a effective

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:52.440
Caption: developer on a delivery team at envato

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.940
Caption: and then they get hired into a team at

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.500
Caption: envato of their choice and then we take

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.940
Caption: two new apprentices and they get to hang

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.859
Caption: out with the developer mentor and do the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.399
Caption: same and this program has existed at

00:04:58.859 --> 00:05:04.079
Caption: envato for about five years now

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:06.479
Caption: and I just joined about six months ago

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:08.159
Caption: to help grow the program

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.300
Caption: so we&#39;re going to circle back to that in

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.600
Caption: a little bit

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:14.759
Caption: so my career journey I have been in tech

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.639
Caption: for about nine years which I think is

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:21.119
Caption: really impressive because I&#39;m only 25

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:23.039
Caption: and so in that nine years I have had the

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:26.220
Caption: same goals but basically the whole time

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:29.160
Caption: one of them was I wanted to feel

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.320
Caption: confident in my role as a developer I

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.759
Caption: got into Tech when I was 16 and I didn&#39;t

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.139
Caption: know what I was doing and I definitely

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.119
Caption: knew that I didn&#39;t know what I was doing

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.759
Caption: and so I&#39;ve spent a lot of my career

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:41.880
Caption: just wanting one day to feel confident

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:43.440
Caption: and like I do know what I&#39;m doing and I

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.360
Caption: think it&#39;s only like maybe six months

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.639
Caption: ago when I joined envato that I finally

00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:50.159
Caption: started to actually feel confident and

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.779
Caption: that yeah I am actually a developer but

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.139
Caption: the other goal that I&#39;ve had in my

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:57.419
Caption: career is I want and have done a lot of

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.300
Caption: work towards helping other women to get

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.320
Caption: into our industry in technical roles in

00:06:00.299 --> 00:06:03.239
Caption: particular

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.679
Caption: and the reason that I&#39;ve had this goal

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:06.779
Caption: is because every time I joined a Dev

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:08.639
Caption: team or worked at a tech company I would

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:10.559
Caption: love it I would have so much fun being a

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.020
Caption: developer but over time I&#39;ll just get

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:15.179
Caption: more and more bitter about how many men

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:17.819
Caption: are on my team and how few women are on

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:19.979
Caption: the team and so I would then bounce back

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.539
Caption: to working in education so I&#39;ve spent

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.759
Caption: about half of my career in education

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.500
Caption: half of my career in Tech and I don&#39;t

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.000
Caption: mean that I went and got a degree in

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.500
Caption: teaching and I taught in school so it&#39;s

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.899
Caption: not what I did I&#39;ve worked with

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.380
Caption: companies like she codes to just Mentor

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:35.759
Caption: other women in Tech of various ages and

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.979
Caption: not just at Chico it&#39;s through various

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.720
Caption: organizations and so through that I have

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.819
Caption: mentored people who are like five years

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.399
Caption: old all the way up to people who are

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:46.139
Caption: very near retirement age so I have a lot

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:48.059
Caption: of experience in teaching people about

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.440
Caption: tech and helping people find roles in

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:51.660
Caption: the tech industry

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.179
Caption: but this created a bit of a different

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.699
Caption: kind of problem for me and that was I&#39;ve

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:59.639
Caption: bounced between education and Tech so

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:01.080
Caption: much but I started feeling like I don&#39;t

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.240
Caption: know how to build my own technical

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:05.939
Caption: skills while I&#39;m spending so much time

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:07.739
Caption: focused on teaching fundamentals because

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.319
Caption: I&#39;ve spent so much time teaching people

00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:12.359
Caption: up until their first role in Tech and I

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:13.739
Caption: haven&#39;t spent any time teaching you know

00:07:12.359 --> 00:07:15.599
Caption: divs who have been in the industry for

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:17.039
Caption: like 15 years that&#39;s just not what I do

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.959
Caption: and so

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:20.699
Caption: throughout my career I&#39;ve had moments of

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:21.959
Caption: imposter syndrome creeping because I

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:24.059
Caption: think oh I&#39;ve spent too long in

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:25.619
Caption: education and I&#39;m starting to not

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:27.299
Caption: understand what my dear friends are

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:29.399
Caption: talking about so now I&#39;m feeling behind

00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:30.779
Caption: and I&#39;d have a small panic and then I&#39;d

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:32.098
Caption: go back and tick but then I&#39;d be in Tech

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:33.479
Caption: and think oh there&#39;s so many dudes here

00:07:32.098 --> 00:07:35.459
Caption: and there&#39;s no woman so then I&#39;d go back

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:37.440
Caption: to education and the cycle just repeated

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:39.839
Caption: itself

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.339
Caption: so part of this was because I was

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:42.779
Caption: feeling like oh I&#39;m spending so much

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:44.759
Caption: time teaching

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:47.098
Caption: and I&#39;m not really spending time working

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:49.440
Caption: on my skills and I had this perception

00:07:47.098 --> 00:07:51.779
Caption: that in order to become a better

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.940
Caption: engineer and in order to improve my

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:55.500
Caption: engineering skills I had to spend a lot

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:57.720
Caption: of time doing what I could engineering

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.940
Caption: things so for me that was programming

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.799
Caption: and I think this makes sense like the

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.839
Caption: more time you spend programming probably

00:08:01.799 --> 00:08:05.039
Caption: you&#39;re going to get better at it and so

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:06.839
Caption: your engineering skills are going to

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:08.940
Caption: improve but I realized that this is

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:10.319
Caption: quite a narrow-minded approach to being

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.360
Caption: an engineer

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:14.160
Caption: and so I&#39;ve adapted this over the last

00:08:12.359 --> 00:08:16.500
Caption: few months I&#39;m from my Roland and butter

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.000
Caption: I&#39;ve realized that this is actually what

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.679
Caption: it is to improve your skills in

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.359
Caption: engineering you&#39;ve got to spend a little

00:08:19.679 --> 00:08:23.098
Caption: bit of time teaching you&#39;ve got to spend

00:08:21.359 --> 00:08:24.959
Caption: a little bit of time programming but if

00:08:23.098 --> 00:08:26.519
Caption: ultimately if you want to really rapidly

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:28.199
Caption: improve your own skills you&#39;ve got to

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:30.299
Caption: spend a lot of time programming and

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:33.598
Caption: teaching you can&#39;t just do one and

00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:35.218
Caption: expect your skills to improve and the

00:08:33.598 --> 00:08:37.200
Caption: reason that I think I&#39;ve had this

00:08:35.218 --> 00:08:39.539
Caption: realization over the last six months is

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.859
Caption: because when I was hired at envato like

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.898
Caption: I went through the interview process to

00:08:40.859 --> 00:08:45.778
Caption: be a developer Mentor but to fit into

00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:47.219
Caption: you know their structure of well how do

00:08:45.778 --> 00:08:48.838
Caption: we pay you and how do we compare you to

00:08:47.219 --> 00:08:52.379
Caption: other people that gave me the role

00:08:48.838 --> 00:08:54.359
Caption: senior engineer and I was so scared

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.679
Caption: because I have never taken on a role

00:08:54.359 --> 00:08:57.778
Caption: that had seen you in the front of it

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:59.278
Caption: before and I was thinking oh my gosh I

00:08:57.778 --> 00:09:01.619
Caption: haven&#39;t been a Dev for actually that

00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:02.940
Caption: long I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing why&#39;d

00:09:01.619 --> 00:09:04.799
Caption: they call me a senior they&#39;re going to

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.880
Caption: find me out so I&#39;m going to be demoted

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:07.500
Caption: I&#39;m going to be fight like all the

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.479
Caption: imposters it just just came everywhere

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:13.619
Caption: but as soon as I started

00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:17.458
Caption: I realized that my career in education

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:20.159
Caption: had prepared me so well into stepping

00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:21.838
Caption: into the role of senior engineer and I

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:23.879
Caption: notice it in the other Engineers that I

00:09:21.838 --> 00:09:25.619
Caption: work with and I notice that in all the

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.838
Caption: engineers I interact with through

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:30.599
Caption: mentoring other programs and also

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:32.278
Caption: through just being on other Dev teams in

00:09:30.599 --> 00:09:34.199
Caption: the past and I&#39;ve realized that the

00:09:32.278 --> 00:09:36.119
Caption: engineers who have dedicated more of

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.160
Caption: their career towards teaching or

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:39.958
Caption: mentoring or generally helping somebody

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:41.159
Caption: else in their team are the better

00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.380
Caption: engineers

00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:45.838
Caption: which shouldn&#39;t sound too shocking but

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.880
Caption: this was quite a realization that I had

00:09:45.838 --> 00:09:50.580
Caption: so I want to unpack this a little bit

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:53.099
Caption: and I want us to have a little chat

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.778
Caption: about how did teaching actually help me

00:09:53.099 --> 00:09:56.219
Caption: to be a better developer and therefore

00:09:54.778 --> 00:09:58.080
Caption: how can it actually help you to be a

00:09:56.219 --> 00:09:59.278
Caption: better developer

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.440
Caption: um and I&#39;m just going to interject here

00:09:59.278 --> 00:10:03.778
Caption: like I said in my blurb I&#39;m going to use

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.159
Caption: a lot of examples about engineering but

00:10:03.778 --> 00:10:06.719
Caption: this could have played as far as I&#39;m

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:08.338
Caption: concerned to anyone in any industry

00:10:06.719 --> 00:10:09.958
Caption: doing any kind of job just my

00:10:08.338 --> 00:10:11.398
Caption: experiences in engineering so that&#39;s

00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:14.219
Caption: what I&#39;m going to roll with

00:10:11.398 --> 00:10:15.659
Caption: so how did teaching help me to be a

00:10:14.219 --> 00:10:18.719
Caption: better Dev

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:20.879
Caption: I have learned that you end up with a

00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:23.278
Caption: much deeper understanding of a concept

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.018
Caption: if you are bracing yourself for someone

00:10:23.278 --> 00:10:27.000
Caption: to ask you why

00:10:25.018 --> 00:10:28.500
Caption: so if you know that you&#39;re going to

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.299
Caption: learn something and next week someone&#39;s

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.338
Caption: going to say oh why did you do that why

00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:34.559
Caption: did you use that why did you put it in

00:10:32.338 --> 00:10:36.539
Caption: that context what would you use instead

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:40.018
Caption: when you know that you&#39;re going to be

00:10:36.539 --> 00:10:42.898
Caption: asked this just absolute massive pile of

00:10:40.018 --> 00:10:44.760
Caption: questions you end up preparing for it so

00:10:42.898 --> 00:10:46.078
Caption: when I go and learn A New Concept I

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.660
Caption: don&#39;t just learn the thing and then

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:51.179
Caption: implement it I learned the thing I learn

00:10:48.659 --> 00:10:53.338
Caption: what alternatives I could use instead I

00:10:51.179 --> 00:10:54.958
Caption: learned where other where else I could

00:10:53.338 --> 00:10:57.000
Caption: implement this thing I learned what the

00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.679
Caption: trade-offs are of this thing and then I

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.179
Caption: go ahead and actually use it and it

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:02.458
Caption: means that the next week when someone

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:04.078
Caption: asks me why I did that like I&#39;m braced

00:11:02.458 --> 00:11:05.278
Caption: for the answer like I know what I want

00:11:04.078 --> 00:11:08.338
Caption: to say

00:11:05.278 --> 00:11:10.078
Caption: and that&#39;s entirely because the more

00:11:08.338 --> 00:11:12.239
Caption: Junior someone is in their career as an

00:11:10.078 --> 00:11:13.919
Caption: engineer so harder their questions are

00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:15.239
Caption: and the more intense the questions are

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:18.119
Caption: and the more they just start to

00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:19.979
Caption: absolutely Grill you I&#39;ve found with the

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:21.778
Caption: the more senior someone is in their

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:23.338
Caption: career the more if I give a confident

00:11:21.778 --> 00:11:25.078
Caption: answer they&#39;re just gonna go yeah okay

00:11:23.338 --> 00:11:26.159
Caption: and they just roll with it whereas the

00:11:25.078 --> 00:11:28.500
Caption: Junior&#39;s gonna be like that&#39;s not good

00:11:26.159 --> 00:11:30.179
Caption: enough I need more and so you end up

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.940
Caption: having to understand something way

00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:34.799
Caption: deeper than you would otherwise

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.958
Caption: hopefully this one&#39;s obvious but it

00:11:34.799 --> 00:11:39.719
Caption: really helps with communication skills

00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:41.760
Caption: because I cannot tell you the number of

00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:43.559
Caption: times in my career I have taught someone

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.278
Caption: what a for Loop is

00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:49.260
Caption: and that doesn&#39;t sound hard but trust me

00:11:47.278 --> 00:11:51.419
Caption: I know this from experience when you

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:55.078
Caption: first start learning to code for Loops

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:57.659
Caption: are like mind-blowing they&#39;re absolutely

00:11:55.078 --> 00:12:00.359
Caption: magical so I&#39;d say 90 of the people

00:11:57.659 --> 00:12:02.278
Caption: learning them and I&#39;d say 50 of the

00:12:00.359 --> 00:12:04.260
Caption: people learning them do not understand

00:12:02.278 --> 00:12:05.760
Caption: the way that I&#39;ve explained it the first

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.078
Caption: time and it doesn&#39;t matter which way I

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.100
Caption: pick to explain it they&#39;re not going to

00:12:07.078 --> 00:12:10.679
Caption: get it they need to hear it a few

00:12:08.099 --> 00:12:12.299
Caption: different ways and so through the

00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:14.398
Caption: process of teaching somebody else a

00:12:12.299 --> 00:12:16.679
Caption: particular skill you end up explaining

00:12:14.398 --> 00:12:18.898
Caption: that same thing over and over again but

00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:20.458
Caption: in different ways every single time and

00:12:18.898 --> 00:12:22.200
Caption: it ends up building up to really good

00:12:20.458 --> 00:12:24.239
Caption: practice for your communication skills

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.859
Caption: so now when I&#39;m working on a Dev team

00:12:24.239 --> 00:12:27.359
Caption: and I try and explain something to

00:12:25.859 --> 00:12:28.679
Caption: somebody else I know that I&#39;m probably

00:12:27.359 --> 00:12:30.239
Caption: going to be able to explain it really

00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:32.099
Caption: well first time and they&#39;re going to

00:12:30.239 --> 00:12:33.958
Caption: actually understand what I&#39;m saying and

00:12:32.099 --> 00:12:35.880
Caption: that&#39;s all from just practice of

00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.200
Caption: teaching people who ask me questions of

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.239
Caption: why but how does that work I don&#39;t

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.380
Caption: understand it&#39;s just from practice of

00:12:39.239 --> 00:12:42.380
Caption: dealing with that for so long

00:12:42.778 --> 00:12:46.919
Caption: it&#39;s also helped me in that I&#39;ve learned

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.380
Caption: that I really have to walk the walk and

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:51.898
Caption: actually do what I tell my apprentices

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:54.958
Caption: and my juniors or whoever I have to do

00:12:51.898 --> 00:12:56.518
Caption: what I tell them to do so I tell the

00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:58.739
Caption: apprentices that I work at envato at the

00:12:56.518 --> 00:13:01.018
Caption: moment I tell them all the time just ask

00:12:58.739 --> 00:13:02.219
Caption: questions just ask the question if you

00:13:01.018 --> 00:13:04.260
Caption: don&#39;t know something just ask the

00:13:02.219 --> 00:13:06.359
Caption: question but then I found that I would

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.040
Caption: have a question and I would open our

00:13:06.359 --> 00:13:10.500
Caption: engineering slack Channel and think oh

00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:11.518
Caption: there&#39;s 150 engineers in here I don&#39;t

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.138
Caption: want to ask the question because I&#39;m

00:13:11.518 --> 00:13:14.398
Caption: going to feel stupid and someone&#39;s going

00:13:13.138 --> 00:13:15.719
Caption: to roll their eyes like why are you us

00:13:14.398 --> 00:13:17.039
Caption: but I just realized you know what I

00:13:15.719 --> 00:13:18.299
Caption: would tell my apprentices to post this

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:19.919
Caption: question so I&#39;m just going to post the

00:13:18.299 --> 00:13:21.359
Caption: question and no one has ever messaged me

00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:23.159
Caption: saying la la that was a dumb question

00:13:21.359 --> 00:13:24.659
Caption: like that doesn&#39;t happen what usually

00:13:23.159 --> 00:13:25.859
Caption: happens is someone says oh I&#39;m following

00:13:24.659 --> 00:13:27.599
Caption: this thread because I also don&#39;t know

00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:30.659
Caption: the answer to this question so it&#39;s

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:32.099
Caption: really helped me to get over my fear of

00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:33.419
Caption: asking questions like I just do it

00:13:32.099 --> 00:13:35.638
Caption: because I tell them to so I should

00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:38.760
Caption: probably do the same

00:13:35.638 --> 00:13:40.018
Caption: it&#39;s also really helped me with imposter

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.578
Caption: syndrome which is what I mentioned at

00:13:40.018 --> 00:13:43.859
Caption: the start of my talk this is why I feel

00:13:41.578 --> 00:13:47.099
Caption: like I finally like feel confident as a

00:13:43.859 --> 00:13:48.359
Caption: developer because I&#39;ve had to coach so

00:13:47.099 --> 00:13:50.219
Caption: many other people through imposter

00:13:48.359 --> 00:13:51.838
Caption: syndrome particularly because most of my

00:13:50.219 --> 00:13:53.578
Caption: career has been focused on helping women

00:13:51.838 --> 00:13:55.859
Caption: get into Tech in particular and we&#39;re

00:13:53.578 --> 00:13:58.199
Caption: atrocious for imposter syndrome so

00:13:55.859 --> 00:14:00.539
Caption: coaching other people through that so

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.700
Caption: often I finally started internalizing it

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:04.799
Caption: to myself and my internal monologue has

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.179
Caption: changed from oh what if they find out

00:14:04.799 --> 00:14:08.099
Caption: I&#39;m not really a senior and I don&#39;t know

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:09.838
Caption: what I&#39;m doing to they hired me as a

00:14:08.099 --> 00:14:11.578
Caption: senior so I mustn&#39;t be so I&#39;ll just call

00:14:09.838 --> 00:14:13.078
Caption: myself one of those now and so the

00:14:11.578 --> 00:14:14.699
Caption: internal monologue it&#39;s totally

00:14:13.078 --> 00:14:15.778
Caption: different now and imposter syndrome is

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.880
Caption: not really something that I struggle

00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:19.260
Caption: with anymore except before this talk I

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.578
Caption: mean I&#39;m starting to freak out of oh

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.338
Caption: what if no one comes so thank you so

00:14:20.578 --> 00:14:26.820
Caption: much for coming foreign

00:14:23.338 --> 00:14:28.559
Caption: I&#39;ve also become way more forgiving of

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.359
Caption: my own knowledge gaps

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:32.398
Caption: because when you first start teaching or

00:14:30.359 --> 00:14:33.659
Caption: mentoring someone else especially if

00:14:32.398 --> 00:14:35.159
Caption: you&#39;re doing this like if you&#39;re giving

00:14:33.659 --> 00:14:37.799
Caption: a presentation or a workshop or

00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:40.078
Caption: something like I feel like your biggest

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:42.239
Caption: fear is someone&#39;s going to ask me a

00:14:40.078 --> 00:14:44.940
Caption: question and I&#39;m gonna have to Google it

00:14:42.239 --> 00:14:46.559
Caption: in front of everybody and that&#39;s really

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.179
Caption: scary because what if you can&#39;t figure

00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:50.638
Caption: it out and then you get all flustered

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:53.159
Caption: but now I&#39;ve learned that actually when

00:14:50.638 --> 00:14:55.259
Caption: someone asks me something and I don&#39;t

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:58.018
Caption: know the answer which realistically is

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.639
Caption: most of the time I now just go cool this

00:14:58.018 --> 00:15:01.198
Caption: is now an exercise in learning how to

00:14:59.638 --> 00:15:02.578
Caption: Google things together so we&#39;re going to

00:15:01.198 --> 00:15:04.259
Caption: go and do this research and see if we

00:15:02.578 --> 00:15:05.698
Caption: can figure it out together and this

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.440
Caption: literally happened a couple weeks ago

00:15:05.698 --> 00:15:08.940
Caption: the apprentices were so obsessed with

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.039
Caption: trying to figure out how to use this

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.260
Caption: hook and react and I haven&#39;t used react

00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:15.599
Caption: in like 18 months so I didn&#39;t know how

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.398
Caption: to do it so we spent two hours Googling

00:15:15.599 --> 00:15:19.018
Caption: trying to implement it didn&#39;t even

00:15:17.398 --> 00:15:20.398
Caption: figure it out in the end but I feel like

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:23.578
Caption: they forgot that we were trying to make

00:15:20.398 --> 00:15:25.260
Caption: it work so it kind of ended up okay so I

00:15:23.578 --> 00:15:26.880
Caption: have become way more forgiving of my own

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.380
Caption: knowledge gaps when they asked me that

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.778
Caption: question and I thought I don&#39;t know how

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.578
Caption: to shoes it just became an exercise and

00:15:30.778 --> 00:15:34.799
Caption: let&#39;s unpack this together and see if we

00:15:32.578 --> 00:15:36.898
Caption: can work it out together

00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:38.458
Caption: and I&#39;m just while the slides on I&#39;m

00:15:36.898 --> 00:15:40.078
Caption: going to Chuck out a dangerous word

00:15:38.458 --> 00:15:42.359
Caption: there where I feel like a lot of people

00:15:40.078 --> 00:15:43.739
Caption: they go the other way so instead of

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:44.880
Caption: being scared of your knowledge gaps and

00:15:43.739 --> 00:15:47.099
Caption: being scared have asked a question

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.380
Caption: you&#39;ve got way too much confidence and

00:15:47.099 --> 00:15:51.000
Caption: that mansplainer comes out in you so you

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.500
Caption: think I don&#39;t know the answer but I&#39;m

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.820
Caption: not going to show them so I&#39;m going to

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.979
Caption: talk with confidence about something

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.500
Caption: completely irrelevant and then they

00:15:55.979 --> 00:16:00.539
Caption: won&#39;t notice which is not true and it is

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.578
Caption: not helpful so I&#39;ve become more

00:16:00.539 --> 00:16:05.518
Caption: comfortable with my own knowledge gaps I

00:16:02.578 --> 00:16:07.859
Caption: don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been a mansplainer

00:16:05.518 --> 00:16:09.958
Caption: but I I don&#39;t think I have or a woman&#39;s

00:16:07.859 --> 00:16:11.578
Caption: planer if you like but I certainly would

00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.719
Caption: never do it now because I&#39;m okay with

00:16:11.578 --> 00:16:13.919
Caption: just saying let&#39;s just Google it and

00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:16.559
Caption: let&#39;s just figure this out or just I

00:16:13.919 --> 00:16:18.958
Caption: don&#39;t know let&#39;s go ask someone else

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:21.659
Caption: so if that in mind

00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:23.698
Caption: I want to talk about how can you be an

00:16:21.659 --> 00:16:26.940
Caption: effective Mentor because clearly these

00:16:23.698 --> 00:16:28.919
Caption: skills are helpful like I feel like I&#39;m

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.539
Caption: a pretty decent engineer and it&#39;s

00:16:28.919 --> 00:16:33.778
Caption: because I&#39;ve spent so much time teaching

00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:35.458
Caption: other people so let&#39;s unpack what do I

00:16:33.778 --> 00:16:37.078
Caption: actually do that&#39;s made me a good

00:16:35.458 --> 00:16:38.698
Caption: teacher and therefore helped me with

00:16:37.078 --> 00:16:40.078
Caption: those skills um and hopefully therefore

00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:42.299
Caption: you can go back to work and feel like

00:16:40.078 --> 00:16:44.099
Caption: you can be a good Mentor as well

00:16:42.299 --> 00:16:47.458
Caption: so something I would like to point out

00:16:44.099 --> 00:16:49.138
Caption: is that simply having knowledge does not

00:16:47.458 --> 00:16:51.000
Caption: make you a good teacher

00:16:49.138 --> 00:16:53.638
Caption: and I actually put this in the slides

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.559
Caption: because a couple weeks ago I was showing

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:57.119
Caption: these slides to the apprentices and I

00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:58.739
Caption: said hey could you give me some ideas

00:16:57.119 --> 00:17:02.099
Caption: what do you think I should mention in

00:16:58.739 --> 00:17:03.958
Caption: here and one of them instantly rolled

00:17:02.099 --> 00:17:06.359
Caption: her eyes in the most dramatic fashion I

00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:07.979
Caption: have ever seen and said oh

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:10.078
Caption: I hate it when you meet those engineers

00:17:07.979 --> 00:17:12.359
Caption: and they&#39;ve been in tech for like 15

00:17:10.078 --> 00:17:14.880
Caption: years and so they think that they can

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:17.938
Caption: teach and they can&#39;t and clearly this

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.099
Caption: person has been burned and and I think

00:17:17.938 --> 00:17:21.779
Caption: we all have I think everybody can

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:23.640
Caption: probably think about that person that

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.739
Caption: they&#39;ve interacted with who clearly

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.660
Caption: thinks they are the absolute bee&#39;s knees

00:17:25.739 --> 00:17:29.640
Caption: because they know everything about this

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:31.559
Caption: one particular topic but they could not

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.058
Caption: explain it to you to save their life but

00:17:31.558 --> 00:17:35.459
Caption: they have the confidence to think they

00:17:33.058 --> 00:17:37.619
Caption: can so I would like to point out that

00:17:35.459 --> 00:17:38.939
Caption: having knowledge does not make you a

00:17:37.619 --> 00:17:40.918
Caption: good teacher

00:17:38.939 --> 00:17:45.418
Caption: which leads me to this dumb expression

00:17:40.918 --> 00:17:47.819
Caption: those who can&#39;t do teach this is such an

00:17:45.418 --> 00:17:51.298
Caption: embarrassing excuse this is what I like

00:17:47.819 --> 00:17:54.839
Caption: to say instead those who know do those

00:17:51.298 --> 00:17:57.239
Caption: that understand teach it is one thing to

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:59.699
Caption: know about a particular concept or

00:17:57.239 --> 00:18:01.739
Caption: library or whatever it is another thing

00:17:59.699 --> 00:18:04.199
Caption: to have the understanding and have the

00:18:01.739 --> 00:18:05.459
Caption: skills to actually teach it to somebody

00:18:04.199 --> 00:18:07.439
Caption: else

00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:09.779
Caption: these are not the same thing

00:18:07.439 --> 00:18:11.459
Caption: and I get so angry when people say those

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.080
Caption: who can&#39;t do teach because I am a

00:18:11.459 --> 00:18:14.520
Caption: teacher and I know what I&#39;m doing and I

00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:15.959
Caption: have a pretty good understanding usually

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.339
Caption: of the things that I&#39;m teaching because

00:18:15.959 --> 00:18:18.839
Caption: I&#39;ve got that deeper understanding

00:18:17.339 --> 00:18:20.579
Caption: because I was prepared for that really

00:18:18.839 --> 00:18:23.279
Caption: terrifying why did you do that question

00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:25.678
Caption: so those who know do those who

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.900
Caption: understand can also teach

00:18:25.678 --> 00:18:30.239
Caption: so with that in mind how do you become

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.619
Caption: an effective Mentor so maybe you have

00:18:30.239 --> 00:18:33.719
Caption: all the knowledge but how do you

00:18:31.619 --> 00:18:36.538
Caption: actually have enough understanding to

00:18:33.719 --> 00:18:39.418
Caption: teach that to someone else

00:18:36.538 --> 00:18:40.558
Caption: so before we run through these skills I

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:41.579
Caption: just want to point out that there are

00:18:40.558 --> 00:18:44.099
Caption: lots of different places where

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:45.479
Caption: mentorship happens because after I give

00:18:44.099 --> 00:18:47.099
Caption: a talk like this someone always comes

00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:50.520
Caption: and asks me for an opportunity so here

00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:52.918
Caption: they are so at work you might have an

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.080
Caption: informal or formal mentorship program we

00:18:52.918 --> 00:18:57.298
Caption: actually do this at envato I mean I have

00:18:55.079 --> 00:18:58.979
Caption: two little mentees at the moment and

00:18:57.298 --> 00:19:01.500
Caption: that comes about just because usually

00:18:58.979 --> 00:19:03.538
Caption: someone says to their manager I&#39;m

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.339
Caption: feeling like I&#39;m missing skills in this

00:19:03.538 --> 00:19:07.019
Caption: particular thing and the manager goes

00:19:05.339 --> 00:19:08.939
Caption: great well I probably can&#39;t help you but

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.099
Caption: maybe we could find someone who can and

00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:12.959
Caption: Bam suddenly I&#39;m getting a DM and now I

00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:15.058
Caption: have a mentee so at the moment I&#39;m

00:19:12.959 --> 00:19:17.520
Caption: mentoring someone on how to speak at

00:19:15.058 --> 00:19:19.260
Caption: conferences so give me some good

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.820
Caption: feedback so I can go back into that next

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:24.058
Caption: mentoring situation some confidence

00:19:20.819 --> 00:19:26.699
Caption: please and also someone wants to upskill

00:19:24.058 --> 00:19:28.739
Caption: their um their knowledge of Ruby on

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:30.479
Caption: Rails and so very different things I&#39;m

00:19:28.739 --> 00:19:33.839
Caption: not an expert in either of those things

00:19:30.479 --> 00:19:34.979
Caption: but I know how to be a good Mentor so if

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:36.779
Caption: you are at work and there&#39;s something

00:19:34.979 --> 00:19:38.459
Caption: that you want to learn or maybe you see

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.320
Caption: someone has a knowledge Gaff or maybe an

00:19:38.459 --> 00:19:41.760
Caption: em is mentioned to you or sorry an

00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:43.079
Caption: engineering manager has mentioned to you

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.400
Caption: hey do you think you&#39;ll be able to help

00:19:43.079 --> 00:19:46.558
Caption: this person with this particular thing

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.660
Caption: that&#39;s an opportunity to actually create

00:19:46.558 --> 00:19:50.819
Caption: some kind of system around it and create

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.440
Caption: some more formalized mentoring

00:19:50.819 --> 00:19:54.058
Caption: there&#39;s also you could pair with other

00:19:52.439 --> 00:19:55.859
Caption: less experienced developers on your team

00:19:54.058 --> 00:19:58.678
Caption: which I really hope that you already do

00:19:55.859 --> 00:20:00.359
Caption: so if someone&#39;s stuck with something you

00:19:58.678 --> 00:20:01.558
Caption: can have a peering session with them to

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:04.079
Caption: work it out

00:20:01.558 --> 00:20:05.760
Caption: onboarding new team members is the best

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:07.079
Caption: opportunity because someone who&#39;s brand

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.280
Caption: new to the team doesn&#39;t know what

00:20:07.079 --> 00:20:09.599
Caption: they&#39;re doing and doesn&#39;t know all the

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.820
Caption: systems they need so this is a really

00:20:09.599 --> 00:20:13.798
Caption: great opportunity to practice mentoring

00:20:11.819 --> 00:20:15.779
Caption: and you could also give team

00:20:13.798 --> 00:20:18.538
Caption: presentations so maybe you have a

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:20.460
Caption: company that is like lunch and learns or

00:20:18.538 --> 00:20:22.678
Caption: maybe you&#39;ve just created a really

00:20:20.459 --> 00:20:24.000
Caption: complicated PR so instead of just

00:20:22.678 --> 00:20:25.319
Caption: putting the pr up and hoping for the

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.819
Caption: best maybe you could run a presentation

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:28.259
Caption: of actually running people through that

00:20:26.819 --> 00:20:30.538
Caption: PR

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.940
Caption: so that&#39;s at work there&#39;s also Community

00:20:30.538 --> 00:20:34.619
Caption: opportunities to be a mentor so for

00:20:32.939 --> 00:20:36.538
Caption: example you could speak up meetups or

00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:38.339
Caption: conferences this feels like a good

00:20:36.538 --> 00:20:40.678
Caption: enough example of that you can also

00:20:38.339 --> 00:20:42.239
Caption: tutor at public coding workshops or you

00:20:40.678 --> 00:20:44.640
Caption: could tutor or teacher things like boot

00:20:42.239 --> 00:20:46.020
Caption: camps so off the top of my head I came

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.760
Caption: up with a list of places like that that

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.799
Caption: do that so she codes General Assembly

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.479
Caption: code Camp codemaster Institute I think

00:20:49.798 --> 00:20:54.178
Caption: all of those places have opportunities

00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:55.619
Caption: in Perth to actually Mentor she codes in

00:20:54.178 --> 00:20:57.119
Caption: particular they&#39;re like literally around

00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:58.260
Caption: the corner go and ask them when they&#39;re

00:20:57.119 --> 00:20:59.579
Caption: next Workshop is because they&#39;re always

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.140
Caption: looking for mentors

00:20:59.579 --> 00:21:02.459
Caption: can you tell I used to work there I&#39;m

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.799
Caption: just slightly biased

00:21:02.459 --> 00:21:07.140
Caption: so there are plenty of opportunities to

00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:10.139
Caption: be a mentor saying I haven&#39;t had the

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:12.419
Caption: opportunity is not good enough there are

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:15.780
Caption: opportunities all around you

00:21:12.418 --> 00:21:18.239
Caption: so what is your actual role as a mentor

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:20.640
Caption: like what is your job as a mentor

00:21:18.239 --> 00:21:24.000
Caption: your job is to help a mentee discover

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:27.178
Caption: ideas and solve problems for themselves

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.520
Caption: so in other words it&#39;s not your job to

00:21:27.178 --> 00:21:31.500
Caption: provide Solutions that&#39;s not useful your

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.058
Caption: job is to help somebody else to figure

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.280
Caption: out what problems they&#39;re actually

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:37.500
Caption: facing and then figure out how to solve

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.119
Caption: those problems so if you&#39;re a visual

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.979
Caption: person person

00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:43.619
Caption: this is this is what I don&#39;t want you to

00:21:40.979 --> 00:21:45.178
Caption: do so sometimes someone needs help with

00:21:43.619 --> 00:21:46.260
Caption: something maybe they&#39;ve got a bug and

00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:47.038
Caption: they can&#39;t get their code running or

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.199
Caption: whatever

00:21:47.038 --> 00:21:50.759
Caption: you provide a solution the code is

00:21:49.199 --> 00:21:52.918
Caption: running and you put yourself on the back

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.678
Caption: and goes sweet I solved the problem I

00:21:52.918 --> 00:21:58.439
Caption: mean great but you actually didn&#39;t

00:21:54.678 --> 00:22:00.000
Caption: really help anyone you solve this one

00:21:58.439 --> 00:22:01.558
Caption: particular problem but did you give them

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.538
Caption: the skills to be able to figure out how

00:22:01.558 --> 00:22:05.219
Caption: to solve it next time I don&#39;t think so

00:22:03.538 --> 00:22:08.519
Caption: did you get anything out of that

00:22:05.219 --> 00:22:10.079
Caption: interaction like did you learn how this

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.459
Caption: person learns and so how you might

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:13.678
Caption: better come at them with solving a

00:22:11.459 --> 00:22:15.719
Caption: problem next time I don&#39;t think so in

00:22:13.678 --> 00:22:17.939
Caption: general this is a really quick fix and

00:22:15.719 --> 00:22:19.859
Caption: it helps no one in the long run

00:22:17.939 --> 00:22:21.779
Caption: so I&#39;m going to show you instead a

00:22:19.859 --> 00:22:23.280
Caption: flowchart of what I use to Mentor other

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.539
Caption: people and it&#39;s a little bit

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.400
Caption: intimidating but it&#39;s okay we&#39;re going

00:22:24.538 --> 00:22:28.979
Caption: to walk through it I did my best

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.659
Caption: so this is what happens whenever someone

00:22:28.979 --> 00:22:32.339
Caption: at work comes to me with a problem that

00:22:30.659 --> 00:22:34.440
Caption: they would like help with

00:22:32.339 --> 00:22:36.719
Caption: so they come to me they&#39;re confused

00:22:34.439 --> 00:22:38.519
Caption: about a particular concept or task so

00:22:36.719 --> 00:22:39.900
Caption: we&#39;re gonna oh I can do this we&#39;re going

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.260
Caption: to start up here so they come to me

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:45.539
Caption: confused about a particular contig

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:48.000
Caption: concept or task so the very first thing

00:22:45.538 --> 00:22:49.798
Caption: that I&#39;m going to do oh I can do this is

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.760
Caption: I&#39;m not going to grab the laptop and

00:22:49.798 --> 00:22:51.839
Caption: start digging and figure out what&#39;s

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.119
Caption: going on I&#39;m going to ask them some

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:56.038
Caption: clarifying questions and the reason I&#39;m

00:22:54.119 --> 00:22:57.658
Caption: going to do that is because quite often

00:22:56.038 --> 00:22:59.819
Caption: when I&#39;m mentoring there&#39;s a couple

00:22:57.659 --> 00:23:01.919
Caption: things that happen someone might use a

00:22:59.819 --> 00:23:03.418
Caption: bunch of really fancy terminology but it

00:23:01.918 --> 00:23:05.158
Caption: turns out that they actually don&#39;t know

00:23:03.418 --> 00:23:06.538
Caption: what those words meant and it&#39;s

00:23:05.159 --> 00:23:08.580
Caption: impressive that they managed to get the

00:23:06.538 --> 00:23:10.859
Caption: sentence together it would be really

00:23:08.579 --> 00:23:11.939
Caption: easy to fall for that and think that

00:23:10.859 --> 00:23:13.678
Caption: that means that they know what they&#39;re

00:23:11.939 --> 00:23:15.239
Caption: talking about and I&#39;m not trying to

00:23:13.678 --> 00:23:17.219
Caption: shame the person in this situation

00:23:15.239 --> 00:23:19.020
Caption: because great they used a bunch of

00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:20.880
Caption: really cool terminology what I&#39;m trying

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.799
Caption: to figure out is how far back do I need

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.000
Caption: to go to actually explain things so if

00:23:22.798 --> 00:23:26.219
Caption: they&#39;ve picked up a word but they&#39;ve

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.599
Caption: used it in the wrong context you need to

00:23:26.219 --> 00:23:29.699
Caption: help them with that you need to solve

00:23:27.599 --> 00:23:31.798
Caption: that so they don&#39;t do that again

00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:34.199
Caption: well the other thing that can happen is

00:23:31.798 --> 00:23:35.939
Caption: someone has the concept figured out but

00:23:34.199 --> 00:23:37.739
Caption: they don&#39;t have the words to describe it

00:23:35.939 --> 00:23:39.599
Caption: so in this case they know the concept

00:23:37.739 --> 00:23:41.400
Caption: they don&#39;t know the terminology to use

00:23:39.599 --> 00:23:43.979
Caption: which makes it really hard to actually

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.539
Caption: form a question so in that case you&#39;re

00:23:43.979 --> 00:23:47.520
Caption: going to ask them some more clarifying

00:23:45.538 --> 00:23:49.319
Caption: questions to figure out which of those

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.940
Caption: categories does this person fit into if

00:23:49.319 --> 00:23:53.158
Caption: either of them and you&#39;re going to work

00:23:50.939 --> 00:23:55.199
Caption: out what are they actually asking me

00:23:53.159 --> 00:23:57.480
Caption: what do they need help with

00:23:55.199 --> 00:23:59.219
Caption: and your job and actually this is

00:23:57.479 --> 00:24:01.979
Caption: something that again a printer said to

00:23:59.219 --> 00:24:04.558
Caption: me a couple weeks ago is it&#39;s a real

00:24:01.979 --> 00:24:05.939
Caption: skill to meet someone at the level that

00:24:04.558 --> 00:24:08.459
Caption: they are at

00:24:05.939 --> 00:24:10.259
Caption: just because you feel super confident in

00:24:08.459 --> 00:24:11.760
Caption: this particular concept it doesn&#39;t mean

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.798
Caption: that you get to go on a rant about how

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.719
Caption: this thing works your job is to figure

00:24:13.798 --> 00:24:17.579
Caption: out what this person is actually asking

00:24:15.719 --> 00:24:19.798
Caption: and then give them the answer

00:24:17.579 --> 00:24:22.199
Caption: appropriate to their level and even if

00:24:19.798 --> 00:24:23.939
Caption: you&#39;re like itching to tell them more

00:24:22.199 --> 00:24:25.439
Caption: and tell tell them about the founder who

00:24:23.939 --> 00:24:27.000
Caption: wrote this thing in the history of

00:24:25.439 --> 00:24:28.798
Caption: owning this happen and then we merge

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.479
Caption: this new version 12 is blah not useful

00:24:28.798 --> 00:24:31.558
Caption: your job is to match the level that

00:24:30.479 --> 00:24:33.418
Caption: they&#39;re at and give them the exact

00:24:31.558 --> 00:24:35.579
Caption: amount of information that they need

00:24:33.418 --> 00:24:37.859
Caption: which leads us to The Next Step so I

00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:41.099
Caption: want you to provide an explanation so

00:24:37.859 --> 00:24:42.359
Caption: once you&#39;ve figured out what uh what

00:24:41.099 --> 00:24:43.739
Caption: they&#39;re actually asking you because

00:24:42.359 --> 00:24:46.319
Caption: you&#39;ve asked those clarifying questions

00:24:43.739 --> 00:24:48.359
Caption: you&#39;re going to provide an explanation

00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:50.279
Caption: and if you don&#39;t know the answer to the

00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:52.020
Caption: question you&#39;re not going to act with

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.700
Caption: confidence and just give them an

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.679
Caption: explanation you&#39;re going to Google it

00:24:53.699 --> 00:24:57.298
Caption: with them and together you&#39;re going to

00:24:55.678 --> 00:25:00.538
Caption: build an explanation and you&#39;re going to

00:24:57.298 --> 00:25:02.219
Caption: try and work out how to actually explain

00:25:00.538 --> 00:25:04.259
Caption: the thing that they don&#39;t understand and

00:25:02.219 --> 00:25:05.819
Caption: I do this all the time I say I have no

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.039
Caption: idea what you&#39;re talking about but the

00:25:05.819 --> 00:25:09.658
Caption: internet does and so we go and we look

00:25:08.038 --> 00:25:11.639
Caption: up some blog posts or find some YouTube

00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:14.039
Caption: videos we learn about it together and

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.839
Caption: then we unpack it together

00:25:14.038 --> 00:25:18.418
Caption: so once you&#39;ve done that you&#39;re then

00:25:15.839 --> 00:25:19.859
Caption: going to do you&#39;re thinking to confirm

00:25:18.418 --> 00:25:21.298
Caption: oh God you&#39;re going to confirm

00:25:19.859 --> 00:25:23.579
Caption: understanding

00:25:21.298 --> 00:25:25.739
Caption: so you&#39;re not just going to go and read

00:25:23.579 --> 00:25:27.839
Caption: blog posts figure it out give a

00:25:25.739 --> 00:25:29.520
Caption: monologue assume they understood and

00:25:27.839 --> 00:25:31.798
Caption: then carry on you&#39;re going to ask them

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.299
Caption: some more questions you&#39;re going to make

00:25:31.798 --> 00:25:35.339
Caption: sure they actually understood what you

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:36.839
Caption: just unpacked and quite often I&#39;ll ask

00:25:35.339 --> 00:25:38.819
Caption: them the exact same question that they

00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:41.400
Caption: came to me with and if they can answer

00:25:38.819 --> 00:25:43.678
Caption: it confidently sweet I&#39;ve done my job

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.419
Caption: they Now understand this thing but if

00:25:43.678 --> 00:25:47.099
Caption: they&#39;re if they can mostly pull an

00:25:45.418 --> 00:25:48.479
Caption: answer together but maybe they still use

00:25:47.099 --> 00:25:49.678
Caption: some wrong terminology maybe they&#39;ve

00:25:48.479 --> 00:25:51.119
Caption: forgotten a word maybe it doesn&#39;t

00:25:49.678 --> 00:25:53.099
Caption: actually quite make sense in this

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:54.900
Caption: particular context in other words

00:25:53.099 --> 00:25:56.699
Caption: they&#39;re still confused then you&#39;re going

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.020
Caption: to ask them some more questions you&#39;re

00:25:56.699 --> 00:26:00.239
Caption: going to try and figure out where are

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.739
Caption: they at now and what blanks do I need to

00:26:00.239 --> 00:26:03.479
Caption: fill in now

00:26:01.739 --> 00:26:06.000
Caption: and you might go through this process

00:26:03.479 --> 00:26:07.558
Caption: many times so you ask a question you

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.239
Caption: give an explanation you&#39;ll confirm the

00:26:07.558 --> 00:26:10.558
Caption: understanding they&#39;re still confused so

00:26:09.239 --> 00:26:12.479
Caption: you&#39;re going to go ask questions again

00:26:10.558 --> 00:26:14.219
Caption: and that&#39;s where that skill of being

00:26:12.479 --> 00:26:16.619
Caption: able to explain something in multiple

00:26:14.219 --> 00:26:18.599
Caption: different ways comes in because you

00:26:16.619 --> 00:26:19.859
Caption: can&#39;t just give an explanation confirm

00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:21.538
Caption: understanding find out they&#39;re still

00:26:19.859 --> 00:26:23.640
Caption: confused and give the exact same

00:26:21.538 --> 00:26:25.739
Caption: explanation and expect there to be a

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.839
Caption: different result it&#39;s literally the

00:26:25.739 --> 00:26:29.158
Caption: definition of insanity so you&#39;re going

00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:31.739
Caption: to practice giving a different kind of

00:26:29.159 --> 00:26:33.840
Caption: explanation instead

00:26:31.739 --> 00:26:35.278
Caption: so once you&#39;ve finally confirmed their

00:26:33.839 --> 00:26:36.778
Caption: understanding

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:38.220
Caption: and I&#39;d like to point out that even

00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:39.419
Caption: though I&#39;ve written makes sense there

00:26:38.219 --> 00:26:41.339
Caption: you&#39;re going to confirm their

00:26:39.418 --> 00:26:43.619
Caption: understanding by doing anything except

00:26:41.339 --> 00:26:45.119
Caption: asking does that make sense because

00:26:43.619 --> 00:26:46.199
Caption: chances are the person&#39;s just going to

00:26:45.119 --> 00:26:47.760
Caption: say yes because that feels like how

00:26:46.199 --> 00:26:49.319
Caption: you&#39;re meant to answer that question not

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.699
Caption: useful so you can ask them a bunch of

00:26:49.319 --> 00:26:52.199
Caption: other questions and determine for

00:26:50.699 --> 00:26:53.519
Caption: yourself whether that seems to have made

00:26:52.199 --> 00:26:54.719
Caption: sense for them

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.640
Caption: and then you&#39;re going to move on to

00:26:54.719 --> 00:26:58.439
Caption: actually solving the problem if there is

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.299
Caption: one because at this point they might

00:26:58.439 --> 00:27:01.918
Caption: have a solution just the explanation

00:27:00.298 --> 00:27:04.319
Caption: that you&#39;ve given might have given them

00:27:01.918 --> 00:27:06.479
Caption: enough information to go with so they

00:27:04.319 --> 00:27:08.759
Caption: have a solution so they need to move on

00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:10.500
Caption: otherwise if they don&#39;t have a solution

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.419
Caption: now you&#39;re going to guide them to one

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.339
Caption: and again you might be pulling out blog

00:27:12.418 --> 00:27:16.319
Caption: posts you might be finding other files

00:27:14.339 --> 00:27:17.520
Caption: in the repo to share them to but you&#39;re

00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:19.319
Caption: going to help them figure out a

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.459
Caption: potential solution you&#39;re not going to

00:27:19.319 --> 00:27:21.899
Caption: give it to them you&#39;re going to have

00:27:20.459 --> 00:27:23.399
Caption: chats you&#39;re going to have brainstorms

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.500
Caption: you&#39;re going to help them figure it out

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.000
Caption: for themselves but before you leave them

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.859
Caption: you&#39;re going to confirm their

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Caption: understanding again you&#39;re going to make

00:27:28.859 --> 00:27:32.099
Caption: sure that they understand what they

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.319
Caption: actually need to do now to solve that

00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:35.520
Caption: problem so they might even tell you the

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:36.418
Caption: exact same thing that you just told them

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.099
Caption: but they might be a little bit more

00:27:36.418 --> 00:27:39.239
Caption: confidence in their voice so you can say

00:27:38.099 --> 00:27:40.558
Caption: I&#39;m going to go look at this particular

00:27:39.239 --> 00:27:42.298
Caption: repo I&#39;m going to find this example

00:27:40.558 --> 00:27:43.619
Caption: because I know that we did it here I&#39;m

00:27:42.298 --> 00:27:45.119
Caption: going to look at this PR that put it up

00:27:43.619 --> 00:27:46.798
Caption: to see the notes so they might give you

00:27:45.119 --> 00:27:48.418
Caption: a full explanation great that means

00:27:46.798 --> 00:27:50.339
Caption: they&#39;ve understood if they&#39;re still a

00:27:48.418 --> 00:27:51.599
Caption: bit hazy they&#39;re not okay to be left

00:27:50.339 --> 00:27:52.979
Caption: alone yet because you&#39;re just going to

00:27:51.599 --> 00:27:54.359
Caption: leave them in a state of confusion which

00:27:52.979 --> 00:27:55.619
Caption: is not what you want to do so you might

00:27:54.359 --> 00:27:57.418
Caption: go through this cycle over and over

00:27:55.619 --> 00:27:59.699
Caption: again as well

00:27:57.418 --> 00:28:01.259
Caption: so finally once they have a solution and

00:27:59.699 --> 00:28:02.699
Caption: they feel confident you&#39;re going to time

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.279
Caption: box them

00:28:02.699 --> 00:28:07.139
Caption: so depending on the complexity of the

00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:08.700
Caption: tasks that you&#39;re giving them that time

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.279
Caption: box could be I&#39;m going to come back to

00:28:08.699 --> 00:28:13.139
Caption: you in 10 minutes it could be I&#39;m going

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:14.700
Caption: to ask in you know tomorrow how that

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.079
Caption: thing went so you&#39;re just going to judge

00:28:14.699 --> 00:28:18.178
Caption: it for yourself to see a complex the

00:28:16.079 --> 00:28:20.819
Caption: thing is so for example a couple weeks

00:28:18.178 --> 00:28:21.959
Caption: ago I was paired with someone who was

00:28:20.819 --> 00:28:24.298
Caption: stuck on something to do with our build

00:28:21.959 --> 00:28:26.939
Caption: pipeline

00:28:24.298 --> 00:28:28.918
Caption: um and as I went through this process

00:28:26.939 --> 00:28:29.879
Caption: uh it probably took me longer than it

00:28:28.918 --> 00:28:31.500
Caption: should have but as we went through this

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.000
Caption: process I realized oh this person

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.099
Caption: actually doesn&#39;t know where build kite

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.418
Caption: fits in and how that connects to GitHub

00:28:35.099 --> 00:28:39.418
Caption: and how these things talk to each other

00:28:36.418 --> 00:28:40.558
Caption: so I&#39;m going to give her 10 minutes and

00:28:39.418 --> 00:28:41.939
Caption: I&#39;m going to say I need you to go do

00:28:40.558 --> 00:28:43.918
Caption: some reading on this particular thing

00:28:41.939 --> 00:28:45.538
Caption: here&#39;s the page of the docs I&#39;d suggest

00:28:43.918 --> 00:28:47.639
Caption: you read in 10 minutes I&#39;m going to come

00:28:45.538 --> 00:28:49.859
Caption: back and we&#39;re just going to see see how

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.419
Caption: you&#39;re going and 10 minutes since you

00:28:49.859 --> 00:28:53.038
Caption: could explain it she had that a half

00:28:51.418 --> 00:28:55.139
Caption: moment everything sunken she now

00:28:53.038 --> 00:28:56.519
Caption: understood which was great it means that

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.558
Caption: we could repeat this process all over

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:00.779
Caption: again so you&#39;re going to time box a task

00:28:58.558 --> 00:29:02.339
Caption: so for me that was go read these dogs

00:29:00.779 --> 00:29:03.720
Caption: then once you&#39;ve done that and you&#39;ve

00:29:02.339 --> 00:29:06.418
Caption: checked in with them you&#39;re now going to

00:29:03.719 --> 00:29:08.880
Caption: consider frustration versus fun is this

00:29:06.418 --> 00:29:10.678
Caption: person still having fun cat was having

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.298
Caption: the best time because she&#39;s really into

00:29:10.678 --> 00:29:14.880
Caption: infrastructure and having that a half

00:29:12.298 --> 00:29:17.278
Caption: moment was great for her so she was

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.140
Caption: ready to just ask the next question be

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:21.720
Caption: guided to a solution and then carry on

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:24.239
Caption: time box another 20 minutes move on

00:29:21.719 --> 00:29:26.158
Caption: the person is no longer if the person is

00:29:24.239 --> 00:29:27.719
Caption: no longer having fun so they&#39;re really

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:29.399
Caption: frustrated and they&#39;re feeling kind of

00:29:27.719 --> 00:29:31.619
Caption: dumb they felt like they haven&#39;t made

00:29:29.399 --> 00:29:34.080
Caption: progress well then you&#39;re not just gonna

00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:35.520
Caption: put them into this Loop of continuing to

00:29:34.079 --> 00:29:36.719
Caption: feel dumb you&#39;re going to go back to the

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.979
Caption: very beginning you&#39;re going to ask them

00:29:36.719 --> 00:29:39.719
Caption: more questions because maybe you didn&#39;t

00:29:37.979 --> 00:29:41.099
Caption: nail it the first time maybe they didn&#39;t

00:29:39.719 --> 00:29:42.778
Caption: actually know what they needed to ask

00:29:41.099 --> 00:29:44.520
Caption: the first time so you&#39;re gonna go back

00:29:42.779 --> 00:29:46.260
Caption: through it all over again but this time

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.459
Caption: you&#39;re going to give some more hints

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.199
Caption: you&#39;re going to give them a little bit

00:29:47.459 --> 00:29:50.939
Caption: more clues you&#39;re going to give them the

00:29:49.199 --> 00:29:52.859
Caption: specific section of the docs the

00:29:50.939 --> 00:29:54.298
Caption: specific line and the file the specific

00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:55.678
Caption: part of that PR or whatever you&#39;re

00:29:54.298 --> 00:29:56.880
Caption: sharing with them you&#39;re going to give

00:29:55.678 --> 00:29:58.918
Caption: them more clues and you&#39;re going to go

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.899
Caption: through the process again

00:29:58.918 --> 00:30:03.479
Caption: if you do and you get to the end and the

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:04.919
Caption: person is now just properly upset and

00:30:03.479 --> 00:30:06.538
Caption: ready to throw their laptop out the

00:30:04.918 --> 00:30:07.798
Caption: window because we have all been there

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:09.898
Caption: then you&#39;re just going to give them the

00:30:07.798 --> 00:30:12.239
Caption: solution and I&#39;m going to tell you that

00:30:09.899 --> 00:30:14.399
Caption: sometimes even though I said don&#39;t do

00:30:12.239 --> 00:30:16.619
Caption: this sometimes you just have to give

00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:18.840
Caption: them the solution it&#39;s not their day

00:30:16.619 --> 00:30:20.520
Caption: it&#39;s Friday afternoon and they&#39;re really

00:30:18.839 --> 00:30:22.260
Caption: tired because learning how to do these

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.719
Caption: things it&#39;s really complicated that&#39;s

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:26.880
Caption: totally fine the chances are they have

00:30:24.719 --> 00:30:28.500
Caption: learned something from this process but

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.239
Caption: they&#39;re now fatigued of learning new

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.859
Caption: things and you need to help them out a

00:30:30.239 --> 00:30:33.239
Caption: little bit more but now you&#39;ve both

00:30:31.859 --> 00:30:35.398
Caption: built this relationship and understand

00:30:33.239 --> 00:30:37.500
Caption: this process of how you&#39;re supposed or

00:30:35.399 --> 00:30:38.700
Caption: what is a useful way to help someone so

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.439
Caption: you&#39;re still going to try it again next

00:30:38.699 --> 00:30:41.819
Caption: time and chances are they&#39;re going to be

00:30:40.439 --> 00:30:43.139
Caption: a bit fresher they&#39;re going to come in

00:30:41.819 --> 00:30:46.558
Caption: knowing you&#39;re about to ask me a bunch

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:48.239
Caption: of questions so I&#39;ve got the answers to

00:30:46.558 --> 00:30:49.798
Caption: those questions ready which in a printer

00:30:48.239 --> 00:30:51.778
Caption: surprised me with because she did that

00:30:49.798 --> 00:30:54.000
Caption: to me a couple of weeks ago so this

00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:56.279
Caption: process works

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.079
Caption: until someone&#39;s really frustrated in

00:30:56.279 --> 00:30:59.220
Caption: which case it&#39;s totally fine just give

00:30:58.079 --> 00:31:01.678
Caption: them the answer

00:30:59.219 --> 00:31:03.658
Caption: just next time you&#39;ll try again we&#39;ve

00:31:01.678 --> 00:31:05.219
Caption: all been in that situation where for me

00:31:03.659 --> 00:31:06.840
Caption: it&#39;s Monday mornings I don&#39;t know my

00:31:05.219 --> 00:31:09.479
Caption: brain&#39;s not on like I&#39;m not learning

00:31:06.839 --> 00:31:10.678
Caption: anything so just give me the answer

00:31:09.479 --> 00:31:12.359
Caption: and while you&#39;re going through this

00:31:10.678 --> 00:31:14.099
Caption: process there&#39;s a couple of things that

00:31:12.359 --> 00:31:15.839
Caption: I want you to remember

00:31:14.099 --> 00:31:17.158
Caption: so I want you to remember to have

00:31:15.839 --> 00:31:19.798
Caption: compassion

00:31:17.159 --> 00:31:22.799
Caption: the earlier someone is in their career

00:31:19.798 --> 00:31:24.839
Caption: the easier it is to suffer with it oh

00:31:22.798 --> 00:31:27.178
Caption: I&#39;m so dumb and everybody else knows

00:31:24.839 --> 00:31:28.500
Caption: more than me and the longer you&#39;ve been

00:31:27.178 --> 00:31:29.939
Caption: in your career probably the more that

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.159
Caption: you&#39;ve forgotten that this was you too

00:31:29.939 --> 00:31:33.839
Caption: like for example

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:35.640
Caption: do you remember what it was like

00:31:33.839 --> 00:31:37.558
Caption: navigating your code editor for the

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.140
Caption: first time you opened a repository with

00:31:37.558 --> 00:31:42.239
Caption: thousands of files in it

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:44.219
Caption: really not but to someone who&#39;s just

00:31:42.239 --> 00:31:47.760
Caption: done that for the first time

00:31:44.219 --> 00:31:49.020
Caption: that is so hard even if they&#39;ve you know

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.219
Caption: they&#39;ve done a boot camp and they&#39;ve

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.558
Caption: learned how to use this particular

00:31:50.219 --> 00:31:54.418
Caption: framework that is not the same when

00:31:52.558 --> 00:31:56.219
Caption: there are thousands and files in there

00:31:54.418 --> 00:31:58.979
Caption: instead of 20. it&#39;s really hard

00:31:56.219 --> 00:32:01.079
Caption: navigating a code editor so while you&#39;re

00:31:58.979 --> 00:32:03.000
Caption: explaining perhaps a really technical

00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:05.459
Caption: concept remember the earlier someone is

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.199
Caption: in their career just the harder they&#39;re

00:32:05.459 --> 00:32:09.058
Caption: going to struggle just because you know

00:32:07.199 --> 00:32:11.099
Caption: it&#39;s not muscle memory to use those

00:32:09.058 --> 00:32:13.439
Caption: shortcuts to jump between files that

00:32:11.099 --> 00:32:14.939
Caption: that hasn&#39;t been developed yet depending

00:32:13.439 --> 00:32:16.500
Caption: on the level that they&#39;re at so while

00:32:14.939 --> 00:32:18.298
Caption: you&#39;re mentoring someone have compassion

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.439
Caption: really think about where they are in

00:32:18.298 --> 00:32:21.719
Caption: their career and what they&#39;re good at

00:32:19.439 --> 00:32:23.699
Caption: and what they still need help with and

00:32:21.719 --> 00:32:26.459
Caption: adjust the language that you use and the

00:32:23.699 --> 00:32:28.139
Caption: pace that you go at to suit them

00:32:26.459 --> 00:32:29.459
Caption: I also want you to talk about your

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.099
Caption: failures

00:32:29.459 --> 00:32:34.798
Caption: this is really important because it&#39;s

00:32:32.099 --> 00:32:36.058
Caption: really easy to feel like oh I messed up

00:32:34.798 --> 00:32:37.079
Caption: and I don&#39;t want to be judged so I&#39;m

00:32:36.058 --> 00:32:39.000
Caption: going to hide it I&#39;m not going to tell

00:32:37.079 --> 00:32:40.439
Caption: anyone no we don&#39;t want that that&#39;s how

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.119
Caption: prod gets broken and everyone feels

00:32:40.439 --> 00:32:43.739
Caption: confused so I want you to talk about

00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:46.739
Caption: your failures

00:32:43.739 --> 00:32:49.380
Caption: I broke prod a few weeks ago and I broke

00:32:46.739 --> 00:32:50.880
Caption: it in a very bad way because we have

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.380
Caption: this little toast that comes up in the

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.000
Caption: corner and when you click it you go to a

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.380
Caption: site that where people sign up and

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.178
Caption: actually give us money so envato

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:59.099
Caption: actually makes money from it and I

00:32:57.178 --> 00:33:02.760
Caption: accidentally got rid of the toast and no

00:32:59.099 --> 00:33:03.719
Caption: one noticed and that was bad so instead

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.820
Caption: of

00:33:03.719 --> 00:33:07.619
Caption: you know trying to bury them like oh

00:33:05.819 --> 00:33:10.380
Caption: just fix this I went to the team like

00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:12.418
Caption: hey team I messed up and so we fixed it

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.640
Caption: right but then what was important about

00:33:12.418 --> 00:33:16.798
Caption: that process is that I then went to the

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.739
Caption: apprentices like oh here&#39;s what I did

00:33:16.798 --> 00:33:21.479
Caption: yesterday I really messed up and so we

00:33:19.739 --> 00:33:23.760
Caption: actually did our own little post-mortem

00:33:21.479 --> 00:33:25.018
Caption: about oh what went wrong and how about

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.519
Caption: we dig through the code and figure out

00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:27.779
Caption: how that happened and let&#39;s talk about

00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:29.340
Caption: the process that we went through to

00:33:27.779 --> 00:33:30.960
Caption: discover that this thing was actually an

00:33:29.339 --> 00:33:32.158
Caption: issue by the way when you&#39;re doing

00:33:30.959 --> 00:33:34.079
Caption: something like that check that it

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:36.299
Caption: actually works on prod because no one

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:38.459
Caption: did and no one noticed so talk about

00:33:36.298 --> 00:33:40.558
Caption: your failures with them quite often

00:33:38.459 --> 00:33:41.880
Caption: they&#39;re going to ask you proven

00:33:40.558 --> 00:33:44.099
Caption: questions that are going to make you

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:46.019
Caption: realize yeah maybe we should adjust our

00:33:44.099 --> 00:33:47.339
Caption: process maybe I should have checked prod

00:33:46.019 --> 00:33:48.720
Caption: when I deployed this thing rather than

00:33:47.339 --> 00:33:50.398
Caption: thinking Broad and staging we&#39;re going

00:33:48.719 --> 00:33:51.658
Caption: to be the same state because that&#39;s

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:54.299
Caption: ridiculous

00:33:51.659 --> 00:33:55.980
Caption: they&#39;re never the same state oh yeah

00:33:54.298 --> 00:33:57.558
Caption: there was it was a whole problem it was

00:33:55.979 --> 00:34:00.298
Caption: a whole thing staging was

00:33:57.558 --> 00:34:01.798
Caption: this is the state that I was in that day

00:34:00.298 --> 00:34:02.819
Caption: when I broke that thing it was not a fun

00:34:01.798 --> 00:34:04.739
Caption: day

00:34:02.819 --> 00:34:06.058
Caption: I also want you to remember to provide

00:34:04.739 --> 00:34:07.319
Caption: meaningful work with meaningless

00:34:06.058 --> 00:34:09.719
Caption: deadlines

00:34:07.319 --> 00:34:11.338
Caption: and this is something that I think we do

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:14.158
Caption: really well at envato with our

00:34:11.339 --> 00:34:15.720
Caption: apprentices so we go we actually sit on

00:34:14.158 --> 00:34:16.979
Caption: delivery teams we send we spend about

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.959
Caption: six weeks on a team and then we hop

00:34:16.979 --> 00:34:21.418
Caption: around and while we&#39;re on those delivery

00:34:18.959 --> 00:34:24.118
Caption: teams our premises are given real cards

00:34:21.418 --> 00:34:25.678
Caption: that do contribute to the products that

00:34:24.118 --> 00:34:27.418
Caption: actually make a difference but they&#39;re

00:34:25.678 --> 00:34:29.158
Caption: given cards specifically that aren&#39;t

00:34:27.418 --> 00:34:31.378
Caption: urgent they have absolutely no deadline

00:34:29.158 --> 00:34:32.760
Caption: attached in fact the earlier they are on

00:34:31.378 --> 00:34:34.678
Caption: in their apprenticeship the more likely

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:36.898
Caption: that in their first six weeks they will

00:34:34.678 --> 00:34:40.260
Caption: not finish that card and instead our

00:34:36.898 --> 00:34:42.118
Caption: goal is to go on tangents learn a bunch

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.859
Caption: of stuff in the process and make sure we

00:34:42.118 --> 00:34:46.079
Caption: do a really good Handover with the team

00:34:43.858 --> 00:34:48.000
Caption: when we leave the team and what that

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.899
Caption: ends up doing is it just takes away the

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.418
Caption: pressure

00:34:48.898 --> 00:34:52.618
Caption: there&#39;s no like oh I need to learn this

00:34:51.418 --> 00:34:54.060
Caption: thing but there&#39;s things to do next week

00:34:52.618 --> 00:34:55.319
Caption: so Haley can you just tell us so we can

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:57.479
Caption: feel like we&#39;re making progress it takes

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.859
Caption: all that away but at the same time they

00:34:57.479 --> 00:35:00.118
Caption: get to feel like they&#39;re actually making

00:34:58.858 --> 00:35:02.219
Caption: a difference on the products that

00:35:00.118 --> 00:35:04.739
Caption: they&#39;re working on so meaningful work

00:35:02.219 --> 00:35:07.439
Caption: meaning meaningless deadlines is

00:35:04.739 --> 00:35:09.479
Caption: probably if you take one thing away this

00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:11.399
Caption: is this should be it this makes a

00:35:09.479 --> 00:35:14.579
Caption: significant difference when you&#39;re

00:35:11.399 --> 00:35:16.139
Caption: onboarding someone new to your team

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:18.420
Caption: and finally I&#39;d also like you to

00:35:16.139 --> 00:35:20.819
Caption: remember to leave your ego at the door

00:35:18.419 --> 00:35:23.098
Caption: just because you&#39;re a contributor to

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:24.359
Caption: Django doesn&#39;t mean that you need to you

00:35:23.099 --> 00:35:25.859
Caption: know throw your weight around and say oh

00:35:24.358 --> 00:35:27.299
Caption: but I wrote it so I know that it works

00:35:25.858 --> 00:35:29.519
Caption: this way so you need to do it this way

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.859
Caption: like in a mentoring session totally not

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:34.679
Caption: useful totally not encouraging totally

00:35:31.858 --> 00:35:36.059
Caption: not friendly so leave your ego at the

00:35:34.679 --> 00:35:37.679
Caption: door it doesn&#39;t matter how much

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.239
Caption: experience you have when you&#39;re

00:35:37.679 --> 00:35:41.040
Caption: mentoring someone you&#39;re focused on them

00:35:39.239 --> 00:35:42.540
Caption: you&#39;re not focused on your experience

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.939
Caption: you&#39;re focused on them and what they

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:48.000
Caption: need to learn

00:35:44.939 --> 00:35:49.800
Caption: so we&#39;ve talked about how mentoring can

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Caption: help you to be a better Dev we&#39;ve talked

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.979
Caption: about how it can help you to Be an

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.479
Caption: Effective mentor and now I want us to

00:35:52.979 --> 00:35:56.159
Caption: talk about how can you actually use all

00:35:54.479 --> 00:35:58.139
Caption: these skills to make a difference in our

00:35:56.159 --> 00:36:00.000
Caption: industry

00:35:58.139 --> 00:36:01.739
Caption: so I would like to point out that only

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.139
Caption: training those that are already in

00:36:01.739 --> 00:36:05.699
Caption: engineering doesn&#39;t really help with our

00:36:04.139 --> 00:36:08.399
Caption: diversity issue

00:36:05.699 --> 00:36:09.899
Caption: like if you look around this room how

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:12.479
Caption: many women in here and how many dudes

00:36:09.899 --> 00:36:14.459
Caption: are here like if you only train the

00:36:12.479 --> 00:36:16.500
Caption: cohort of people in this room are we

00:36:14.459 --> 00:36:19.139
Caption: helping to produce more Role Models or

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.339
Caption: improve the diversity in Industry no we

00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:21.539
Caption: are doing a great thing because we&#39;re

00:36:20.339 --> 00:36:23.520
Caption: helping each other and we&#39;re helping

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:25.380
Caption: build our community to upskill and

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.599
Caption: that&#39;s fantastic but you&#39;re not helping

00:36:25.379 --> 00:36:29.879
Caption: with diversity so I want you to use

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:31.500
Caption: these skills to actually shift the

00:36:29.879 --> 00:36:34.739
Caption: needle and get some more interesting and

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:36.419
Caption: different teams built in our industry

00:36:34.739 --> 00:36:37.979
Caption: so I want you to consider taking on

00:36:36.419 --> 00:36:40.139
Caption: Career changes

00:36:37.979 --> 00:36:42.659
Caption: for diversity of thought and experience

00:36:40.139 --> 00:36:44.879
Caption: and what I mean by this is

00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:47.338
Caption: so many places go to like a university

00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:48.659
Caption: for the main recruitment drive you look

00:36:47.339 --> 00:36:50.700
Caption: at the number of people who are in

00:36:48.659 --> 00:36:53.159
Caption: University or Tafe or even boot camps

00:36:50.699 --> 00:36:55.020
Caption: they&#39;re they are predominantly men this

00:36:53.159 --> 00:36:57.358
Caption: is not a secret so if that is where

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:59.159
Caption: you&#39;re primarily going to recruit then

00:36:57.358 --> 00:37:01.439
Caption: you are primarily attempting to recruit

00:36:59.159 --> 00:37:02.939
Caption: men and you are leaving women behind so

00:37:01.439 --> 00:37:04.260
Caption: I want you to consider taking on Career

00:37:02.939 --> 00:37:06.179
Caption: changes people who have taught

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:08.219
Caption: themselves at home and maybe done a few

00:37:06.179 --> 00:37:09.419
Caption: workshops and they&#39;re feeling confident

00:37:08.219 --> 00:37:11.699
Caption: and they&#39;re feeling like they&#39;re ready

00:37:09.419 --> 00:37:13.020
Caption: to learn and you might think oh but do

00:37:11.699 --> 00:37:14.639
Caption: they have the experience they haven&#39;t

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.560
Caption: done this training if someone is

00:37:14.639 --> 00:37:18.239
Caption: prepared to change careers I can

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.099
Caption: guarantee you they are prepared to learn

00:37:18.239 --> 00:37:21.839
Caption: and they&#39;re going to be dedicated they

00:37:20.099 --> 00:37:23.940
Caption: will be a great person to hire and train

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:26.099
Caption: yourself

00:37:23.939 --> 00:37:28.078
Caption: I&#39;d also like you to consider upskilling

00:37:26.099 --> 00:37:29.579
Caption: those that are gender diverse to create

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:32.520
Caption: more role models

00:37:29.579 --> 00:37:34.920
Caption: and how might you do that so at envato

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:38.040
Caption: we like to see our Apprentice program

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:39.598
Caption: isn&#39;t equal but it is fair and we say

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.199
Caption: that because our Apprentice program

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:45.359
Caption: actually only takes on people who

00:37:42.199 --> 00:37:48.000
Caption: identify as women we do not take CIS men

00:37:45.358 --> 00:37:49.979
Caption: into The Apprentice program and at first

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.618
Caption: thought and I&#39;d be at someone in here is

00:37:49.979 --> 00:37:55.800
Caption: really outraged about that right now so

00:37:52.618 --> 00:37:57.479
Caption: yes you are right it is not equal but

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.579
Caption: quite often someone says well that&#39;s not

00:37:57.479 --> 00:38:01.560
Caption: fair and what I would like to point out

00:37:59.579 --> 00:38:04.619
Caption: to you is that if you go to university

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:06.359
Caption: or Tafe or a boot camp you&#39;ll see plenty

00:38:04.618 --> 00:38:08.760
Caption: of men and you&#39;ll see hardly a new woman

00:38:06.358 --> 00:38:10.799
Caption: men have every opportunity to get into

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.320
Caption: this industry it is much harder to be a

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.359
Caption: woman in this industry it is much much

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.800
Caption: harder to break into this industry it is

00:38:15.358 --> 00:38:18.179
Caption: much harder to get over your imposter

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.679
Caption: syndrome in this industry it is much

00:38:18.179 --> 00:38:21.899
Caption: harder to find a role model in this

00:38:19.679 --> 00:38:24.239
Caption: industry and if you would like to argue

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:26.760
Caption: with me on that later I am more than

00:38:24.239 --> 00:38:28.919
Caption: happy to because this rant can go on a

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.839
Caption: lot longer than this one slide so I

00:38:28.919 --> 00:38:32.760
Caption: would like you to consider when you go

00:38:30.839 --> 00:38:34.020
Caption: in highest someone who&#39;s new to this

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.179
Caption: industry

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:37.560
Caption: could you be more diverse in your hiring

00:38:36.179 --> 00:38:39.659
Caption: practices

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:42.359
Caption: could you maybe remove names from CVS

00:38:39.659 --> 00:38:45.239
Caption: for example and just take out you know

00:38:42.358 --> 00:38:46.618
Caption: the burden of oh I&#39;ve seen their name so

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:48.719
Caption: I know this person&#39;s a woman I know this

00:38:46.618 --> 00:38:49.979
Caption: person it&#39;s a man and just hire on you

00:38:48.719 --> 00:38:51.780
Caption: know the experience and what they bring

00:38:49.979 --> 00:38:52.919
Caption: to the team and how willing they are to

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.540
Caption: learn

00:38:52.919 --> 00:38:56.639
Caption: rather than

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:58.020
Caption: going to your universities and going to

00:38:56.639 --> 00:38:59.219
Caption: tapes and going to your boot camps

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.679
Caption: unless it&#39;s she codes because that&#39;s for

00:38:59.219 --> 00:39:03.060
Caption: women because then you&#39;re already you&#39;ve

00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:05.098
Caption: got a problem in your hiring pipeline

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.900
Caption: already

00:39:05.099 --> 00:39:08.520
Caption: and quickly I&#39;d also like us to run

00:39:06.899 --> 00:39:10.618
Caption: through just what are the other benefits

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.479
Caption: of upscaling internally

00:39:10.618 --> 00:39:14.519
Caption: you can teach people the habits you want

00:39:12.479 --> 00:39:16.979
Caption: especially if you&#39;re hiring someone and

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.540
Caption: this is their very first role in Tech if

00:39:16.979 --> 00:39:20.040
Caption: you hire a senior that person&#39;s coming

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.859
Caption: with opinions

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:24.599
Caption: and that person&#39;s coming with biases I

00:39:22.858 --> 00:39:26.519
Caption: don&#39;t like that Tech I live in the

00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:28.740
Caption: Google space Oh you use teams I&#39;ll never

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:31.560
Caption: be I&#39;ll never work for you

00:39:28.739 --> 00:39:33.239
Caption: you know or oh I&#39;m a react person I

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.800
Caption: couldn&#39;t possibly like we&#39;re not going

00:39:33.239 --> 00:39:37.199
Caption: to do this new project review because we

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:39.000
Caption: like react like a senior has opinions a

00:39:37.199 --> 00:39:40.379
Caption: junior doesn&#39;t a Junior&#39;s going to hear

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.639
Caption: that you love react and think yeah I

00:39:40.379 --> 00:39:44.219
Caption: love react too

00:39:41.639 --> 00:39:45.838
Caption: so teach you know the more Junior you

00:39:44.219 --> 00:39:47.338
Caption: hire the more opportunity you&#39;ve got to

00:39:45.839 --> 00:39:49.140
Caption: teach people the habits that you want

00:39:47.339 --> 00:39:50.520
Caption: them to have which sounds really evil

00:39:49.139 --> 00:39:51.719
Caption: but like it&#39;s really good for your

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.000
Caption: company

00:39:51.719 --> 00:39:55.858
Caption: it also I want you to think of it as an

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.199
Caption: investment so this is an opportunity to

00:39:55.858 --> 00:40:01.319
Caption: give your reputation a boost within

00:39:58.199 --> 00:40:03.899
Caption: envato our Apprentice program is really

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:06.000
Caption: well recognized and people are excited

00:40:03.899 --> 00:40:07.799
Caption: about our Apprentice program because the

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.079
Caption: apprentices that we create

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:13.439
Caption: like they are exceptional developers

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:15.960
Caption: they do extremely well at envato and it

00:40:13.439 --> 00:40:18.179
Caption: generally just kind of helps boost just

00:40:15.959 --> 00:40:20.338
Caption: the morale around the company like

00:40:18.179 --> 00:40:21.959
Caption: whenever we get new apprentices in if

00:40:20.339 --> 00:40:23.520
Caption: everybody&#39;s like we&#39;re a virtual

00:40:21.959 --> 00:40:25.379
Caption: community but somehow everyone&#39;s kind of

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.119
Caption: a bit like oh my God the apprentices are

00:40:25.379 --> 00:40:28.799
Caption: starting today or Apprentice graduation

00:40:27.118 --> 00:40:30.118

Caption: company

00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:35.339
Caption: and as a result we also get longer

00:40:33.118 --> 00:40:37.078
Caption: tenures the apprentices that we train in

00:40:35.339 --> 00:40:39.660
Caption: envato stay with us for a really long

00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:42.000

Caption: people at envato they talk about when we

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.358

Caption: assigning them a developer mentor and

00:40:58.919 --> 00:41:02.819
