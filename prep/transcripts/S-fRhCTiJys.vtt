Caption: [Applause]

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:07.258
Caption: thank you very much

00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:09.479
Caption: um wow that was allowed uh okay um so

00:00:07.258 --> 00:00:10.739
Caption: yeah look I&#39;m here to talk about web3

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:13.079
Caption: the great con

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:15.239
Caption: um uh look I yeah I&#39;m the CTO and

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.038
Caption: co-founder at climate clever

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:19.680
Caption: um I love JavaScript

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:21.420
Caption: um all things JavaScript uh and have a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.799
Caption: big bit of a passion for environment and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.778
Caption: privacy

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:27.180
Caption: um I just obviously like to start by

00:00:24.778 --> 00:00:28.438
Caption: acknowledging uh the traditional owners

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.260
Caption: of the land that were gathered on here

00:00:28.438 --> 00:00:34.319
Caption: today and pay my respects to Elders past

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.540
Caption: present and emerging okay so I think

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:38.340
Caption: it&#39;s really really important to just set

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.440
Caption: the tone before I jump into this talk

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.760
Caption: because I&#39;ve already had some

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:44.939
Caption: interesting

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:46.859
Caption: feedback so it&#39;s okay if you disagree

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:49.259
Caption: with the things that I say in this talk

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.120
Caption: we&#39;re allowed to disagree we don&#39;t all

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:53.699
Caption: have to think the same thing

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:57.058
Caption: however what I&#39;m really going to be

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.739
Caption: talking about today is not really my

00:00:57.058 --> 00:01:00.718
Caption: opinion although there&#39;s a little bit of

00:00:58.738 --> 00:01:02.578
Caption: my opinion sprinkled in there most of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.979
Caption: these are facts and issues that we

00:01:02.578 --> 00:01:07.139
Caption: actually need to look at and they need

00:01:04.978 --> 00:01:10.319
Caption: addressing we can&#39;t just ignore them

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:11.760
Caption: so yeah just keep that in mind we&#39;re

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:13.379
Caption: allowed to disagree if you want to come

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.840
Caption: talk to me later about stuff you&#39;re more

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:17.519
Caption: than welcome to but you won&#39;t be able to

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:18.539
Caption: change my mind hopefully I can change

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:21.419
Caption: yours

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.799
Caption: um but hey let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s just um

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:25.559
Caption: let&#39;s have a quick look at what we&#39;re

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.259
Caption: going over today oh that was weird uh

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:29.040
Caption: that&#39;s why is it hang on a sec seems to

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.119
Caption: be

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.119
Caption: just

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.000
Caption: going itself so strange

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.619
Caption: let&#39;s let&#39;s try again Okay cool so

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.959
Caption: agenda so I&#39;m going to give you a little

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.000
Caption: overview of blockchain crypto nft and

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:45.360
Caption: web3 uh we&#39;re going to talk about

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.959
Caption: ransomware uh energy use proof of stake

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.419
Caption: fraud decentralization censorship

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.639
Caption: privacy and we&#39;re going to end with the

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:56.459
Caption: financialization of everything now

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:58.619
Caption: that&#39;s a lot and these are all very deep

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.360
Caption: big topics that deserve their own talk

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.639
Caption: so we&#39;re going to dip into them a little

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.020
Caption: bit just so you can walk away with some

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:05.219
Caption: good knowledge

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:08.220
Caption: okay

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.779
Caption: so let&#39;s talk about blockchain what does

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.520
Caption: that even mean for those of you who

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:14.458
Caption: don&#39;t know so the best way to think

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.160
Caption: about it is a Excel sheet right so an

00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:19.319
Caption: Excel sheet can sort of simulate a

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.419
Caption: blockchain and every row that&#39;s added to

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.339
Caption: that Excel sheet is like another Block

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.738
Caption: in the chain right so it&#39;s like a it&#39;s

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:27.539
Caption: like a ledger a digital Ledger and the

00:02:25.738 --> 00:02:29.759
Caption: best way to also think about it is that

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:32.159
Caption: each row added in the Excel sheet or

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:34.199
Caption: each block added to the chain normally

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.300
Caption: refers to the block that came before it

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.458
Caption: and it does that using some form of

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.098
Caption: cryptography or cryptography always get

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:42.300
Caption: those two words mixed around okay and

00:02:41.098 --> 00:02:44.098
Caption: another thing to think about is

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.260
Caption: transactions are normally irreversible

00:02:44.098 --> 00:02:47.940
Caption: so if a block has been added to the

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:49.738
Caption: chain and you want to change it you

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.540
Caption: normally have to change every single

00:02:49.738 --> 00:02:53.399
Caption: block that comes after it and that&#39;s

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:56.159
Caption: often referred to as forking the chain

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:58.378
Caption: so that&#39;s a very brief overview of what

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.480
Caption: blockchain is so let&#39;s talk about crypto

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:03.958
Caption: because that&#39;s probably the biggest use

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:05.819
Caption: of blockchain okay and where shall we

00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:08.220
Caption: start we&#39;ll start with Bitcoin which is

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.598
Caption: the biggest and the original so uh for

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.238
Caption: those of you old enough to remember we

00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:14.819
Caption: had the wonderful banking crisis in 2008

00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:16.559
Caption: uh where the banks basically ripped us

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.839
Caption: all off and the governments failed to

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:21.179
Caption: regulate them properly so out of that

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:23.098
Caption: arose Bitcoin it was supposed to be an

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:25.378
Caption: end to centralize banking so

00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:27.598
Caption: peer-to-peer currency and your crypto

00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:29.940
Caption: wallet would work like a bank but the

00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:32.699
Caption: biggest difference is that it would be

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.699
Caption: protected and safe against cash crises

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:38.399
Caption: like inflation or deflation that we

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.658
Caption: experience with centralized currency so

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.579
Caption: it was supposed to be you know this

00:03:39.658 --> 00:03:44.580
Caption: thing that would liberate us all now

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.819
Caption: obviously its biggest and best probably

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.040
Caption: first use was uh Silk Road where you

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.798
Caption: could buy drugs online and get them in

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:54.719
Caption: the post a week later now uh Crypt

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:57.598
Caption: blockchain itself and Bitcoin at this

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.158
Caption: point were slow and expensive to use so

00:03:57.598 --> 00:04:01.378
Caption: the trade-off for getting drugs in the

00:03:59.158 --> 00:04:03.479
Caption: post with those High transaction fees

00:04:01.378 --> 00:04:04.819
Caption: and slow transaction times was kind of

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:07.139
Caption: worth it

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.720
Caption: obviously Silk Road was eventually shut

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.598
Caption: down now Bitcoin also uses something

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.500
Caption: called proof of work to add blocks to

00:04:12.598 --> 00:04:16.320
Caption: the chain

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.699
Caption: so in real simple terms

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.160
Caption: what that means is that the minor nodes

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:25.500
Caption: compete to solve an algorithm based on

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.940
Caption: the data inside the block and then it

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.919
Caption: gets added to the chain and that&#39;s

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.619
Caption: called proof of work but that Pro

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.679
Caption: process of you know Computing the data

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:35.880
Caption: in the algorithm is energy intensive and

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:37.799
Caption: that&#39;s why it&#39;s called proof of work

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.139
Caption: because you have to prove that you&#39;ve

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:41.879
Caption: wasted some time and done some work and

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.600
Caption: we&#39;ll talk a bit more about that in a

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.520
Caption: bit

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.500
Caption: okay so let&#39;s talk about ethereum so

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:49.138
Caption: probably the second biggest crypto

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.299
Caption: blockchain thing after Bitcoin um so

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.059
Caption: it&#39;s created by vitalik butarian and

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:55.619
Caption: launched in 2014 there were other

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:57.779
Caption: co-founders

00:04:55.619 --> 00:05:00.959
Caption: um involved as well it boasted lower

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:02.820
Caption: fees and faster transactional times and

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:05.459
Caption: the interesting about ethereum is it

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.040
Caption: could track blocks of data not just the

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:10.919
Caption: ethereum coin and these blocks of data

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.600
Caption: can be used to store programs often

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.119
Caption: um you know little bits of code whatever

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.800
Caption: whatever you can think of and vitalik

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:18.479
Caption: had a vision you know he envisioned a

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:21.019
Caption: future with the whole internet was

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.360
Caption: Rewritten where it was all decentralized

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:26.339
Caption: bypassing governments and Banks and

00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:28.859
Caption: other centralized Services you know your

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:29.820
Caption: very identity could be stored on the

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:31.859
Caption: Chain

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.960
Caption: um a term that comes up a lot and we&#39;re

00:05:31.859 --> 00:05:37.258
Caption: going to talk about it is banking the

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:39.000
Caption: young banked and the Forgotten which

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.440
Caption: personally I&#39;m not too sure what that

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.380
Caption: actually means but we&#39;ll talk about it

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.239
Caption: okay so I&#39;ve shared this quote from it&#39;s

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.320
Caption: doing that sorry I do apologize it&#39;s

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:47.638
Caption: doing that thing where it&#39;s like

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.559
Caption: skipping

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.660
Caption: slides

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:53.759
Caption: okay so I&#39;ve shared this quote from

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.399
Caption: vitalik so I&#39;ll read it to you I cried

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.799
Caption: myself to sleep and on that day I

00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:01.259
Caption: realized what Horrors centralized

00:05:58.799 --> 00:06:03.359
Caption: Services can bring now that sounds

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.320
Caption: pretty drastic right so you&#39;d think he&#39;d

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:09.359
Caption: be talking about something absolutely

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.160
Caption: devastating but it turns out he&#39;s

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:13.079
Caption: talking about World of Warcraft so he

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.539
Caption: used to play World of Warcraft

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:17.459
Caption: and he logs on one day to find that his

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.739
Caption: favorite Mage wizard character&#39;s

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:21.720
Caption: favorite spell has been nerfed by the

00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:23.759
Caption: dev team because the dev team thought it

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.559
Caption: was too effective and that was his

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.239
Caption: reaction and I haven&#39;t posted this to

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:29.699
Caption: make fun of him like we&#39;ve all got way

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:31.138
Caption: attached to something in our lives I&#39;ve

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.660
Caption: definitely got attached to video games

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.399
Caption: in the past but it&#39;s just I think it&#39;s

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.440
Caption: worth sharing because it&#39;s interesting

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:40.019
Caption: looking at the sort of thought process

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.339
Caption: that&#39;s happening inside the head of a

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:43.198
Caption: lot of the people working in the web 3

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:46.500
Caption: space

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:49.020
Caption: okay so nfts I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ve all

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.079
Caption: seen nfts over the last few years they

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:54.418
Caption: really exploded during covid

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:56.220
Caption: um or non-fungible tokens is their full

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:58.199
Caption: name it&#39;s a way of proving that

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.479
Caption: something is unique from a technical

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:03.360
Caption: perspective they&#39;re just this serial

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:05.940
Caption: number that can&#39;t be split into smaller

00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:07.559
Caption: parts right so you know if you have two

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.539
Caption: nfts of the same thing they&#39;re going to

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:11.039
Caption: have different serial numbers so if you

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.500
Caption: took a picture of me right now away from

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.880
Caption: my arms and we turn that into an nft the

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.319
Caption: first one would have one serial number

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.720
Caption: the second one would have another serial

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.919
Caption: number and it&#39;s a bit like Prince of a

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.899
Caption: painting so you know when you have a

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.759
Caption: painting and you make prints the first

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:25.319
Caption: one is worth the most the second one a

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:28.440
Caption: little bit less and third and so on and

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:30.359
Caption: so forth now nfts

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.000
Caption: often referred to as tokens that

00:07:30.359 --> 00:07:35.758
Caption: digitalize something can also store

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.799
Caption: small packets of data or code and these

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.979
Caption: are often referred to as smart contracts

00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:42.478
Caption: now nfts are supposed to be a revolution

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:44.039
Caption: where they could liberate artists from

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:47.759
Caption: the gig economy they could be used for

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:49.619
Caption: identity tickets ownership and more

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:51.299
Caption: and I&#39;m just going to once again just

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:53.399
Caption: step out of our little timeline here to

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:56.879
Caption: talk about another tweet from someone in

00:07:53.399 --> 00:08:00.359
Caption: the nft space which I just find a little

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.119
Caption: confusing so nfts equal identity 2.0

00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:05.879
Caption: can&#39;t remember the last time I used my

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:08.098
Caption: picture on the left and I&#39;ll read these

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.619
Caption: out to you emphasis on physical traits

00:08:08.098 --> 00:08:12.679
Caption: genetic Lottery prone to bias and

00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:16.079
Caption: Prejudice and then under his nft

00:08:12.679 --> 00:08:19.199
Caption: identity by choice unique and digitally

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:21.299
Caption: scarce representation of values and

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:23.878
Caption: beliefs now I&#39;m going to put aside the

00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:25.978
Caption: fact that the nft looks like something

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:26.819
Caption: that we used to make in Ms pain at High

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:29.639
Caption: School

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:31.378
Caption: and the thing is Santiago has a vested

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:34.320
Caption: interest in you believing this is the

00:08:31.378 --> 00:08:36.359
Caption: case because he paid the equivalent of a

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.718
Caption: hundred and seventy one thousand US

00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:41.098
Caption: dollars for that nft on the right so

00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:43.200
Caption: quite interesting

00:08:41.098 --> 00:08:45.359
Caption: okay so last technical term and then

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:49.018
Caption: we&#39;re gonna delve into the

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:50.940
Caption: um the juicy bits um so web3 so web one

00:08:49.018 --> 00:08:53.219
Caption: is like static content you know the web

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.018
Caption: in the early days where you would read

00:08:53.219 --> 00:08:57.479
Caption: stuff you know on the internet you

00:08:55.018 --> 00:08:59.760
Caption: didn&#39;t interact with it web 2 is users

00:08:57.479 --> 00:09:02.398
Caption: creating content so like YouTube social

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.260
Caption: media we make videos we make posts you

00:09:02.398 --> 00:09:07.440
Caption: know it&#39;s a much more service orientated

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.838
Caption: internet web3 is supposed to be this new

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.820
Caption: Revolution in the crypto space where

00:09:09.838 --> 00:09:14.580
Caption: users control their data and content

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:17.220
Caption: things are more distributed and it&#39;s not

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.898
Caption: controlled by big corporations now the

00:09:17.219 --> 00:09:20.518
Caption: thing is I actually agree with some of

00:09:18.898 --> 00:09:22.080
Caption: that you know terminology being used

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:24.359
Caption: there I do believe we should all control

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.338
Caption: our own data and I also believe that

00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:29.338
Caption: having all the power in a few tech

00:09:26.338 --> 00:09:31.619
Caption: companies is a bad idea but I really

00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:35.159
Caption: disagree with the execution

00:09:31.619 --> 00:09:37.859
Caption: okay so time to spread some fud what&#39;s

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:40.259
Caption: fud Alex um so in the crypto space when

00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:42.419
Caption: you spread negative thoughts or

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.000
Caption: sentiment or point out critical issues

00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:47.159
Caption: in a project you often get accused of

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.320
Caption: spreading fud you know you&#39;re preventing

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:51.059
Caption: us all going to the moon and buying

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.440
Caption: Lambos or whatever they say so let&#39;s

00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:54.599
Caption: spread some fud

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:58.018
Caption: okay let&#39;s talk about ransomware really

00:09:54.599 --> 00:10:01.679
Caption: quickly ransomware is a terrible thing

00:09:58.018 --> 00:10:04.979
Caption: right we are seeing schools hospitals

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:07.320
Caption: energy Supply pipelines being held to

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:09.059
Caption: Ransom by cyber criminals and most of

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.559
Caption: the time they have to pay in Bitcoin to

00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:12.659
Caption: get their data back once it&#39;s been

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:15.599
Caption: stolen and encrypted we even have

00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:17.219
Caption: individuals I mean I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some

00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:19.619
Caption: of you in this room with grandparents

00:10:17.219 --> 00:10:21.838
Caption: that have had their data stolen and been

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:25.500
Caption: you know held at Ransom it happens all

00:10:21.838 --> 00:10:28.320
Caption: the time and this is a 5.2 billion

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.179
Caption: dollar a year industry that is insane in

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.160
Caption: fact that number has probably gone up

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:34.559
Caption: since I made this slide

00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:37.500
Caption: and it&#39;s worth pointing out that this

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:39.479
Caption: industry is only as big as it is because

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.000
Caption: of things like Bitcoin

00:10:39.479 --> 00:10:44.518
Caption: because the thing is if you get held to

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.679
Caption: Ransom with your data and they say

00:10:44.518 --> 00:10:48.958
Caption: transfer twenty thousand dollars to us

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:51.059
Caption: please if you go down to your bank to do

00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:53.458
Caption: that online or in person they&#39;re going

00:10:51.059 --> 00:10:54.898
Caption: to have questions about transferring

00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:56.578
Caption: twenty thousand dollars they&#39;re not

00:10:54.898 --> 00:10:58.380
Caption: going to just let you do it

00:10:56.578 --> 00:11:00.539
Caption: and the thing is if they know that the

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.000
Caption: receiver is a known criminal or on their

00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:04.919
Caption: sanctions list they&#39;re also not going to

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.898
Caption: do it the thing is by creating things

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:08.940
Caption: like Bitcoin we&#39;ve actually created

00:11:06.898 --> 00:11:11.099
Caption: loopholes around our centralized

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.380
Caption: Services allowing Industries like this

00:11:11.099 --> 00:11:15.239
Caption: to flourish now look I&#39;m not going to be

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.220
Caption: the first one to defend Banks they have

00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:19.739
Caption: screwed us over a lot you know just look

00:11:17.219 --> 00:11:21.719
Caption: at 2008 for example but the thing is

00:11:19.739 --> 00:11:24.419
Caption: centralized Services exist for a reason

00:11:21.719 --> 00:11:26.518
Caption: you know security sanctions and laws

00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:29.099
Caption: need to be paid attention to and look

00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:31.440
Caption: they&#39;re not always perfect but the thing

00:11:29.099 --> 00:11:33.838
Caption: is we do have democratic governments so

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.700
Caption: we can try and get people elected that

00:11:33.838 --> 00:11:38.099
Caption: make it better rather than creating

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.440
Caption: loopholes that create Industries as

00:11:38.099 --> 00:11:42.179
Caption: predatory as this

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.220
Caption: so let&#39;s talk about energy and

00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:46.260
Caption: environment possibly my favorite topic

00:11:44.219 --> 00:11:48.299
Caption: because I work in the climate space now

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.040
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk about Bitcoin first

00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:52.018
Caption: and for those of you who work in the

00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:54.239
Caption: space don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll get to

00:11:52.018 --> 00:11:56.458
Caption: environmentally friendly crypto coins as

00:11:54.239 --> 00:11:59.159
Caption: well but we need to talk about Bitcoin

00:11:56.458 --> 00:12:03.000
Caption: because it is the biggest and the worst

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:05.819
Caption: right so Bitcoin uses 0.5 of the world&#39;s

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.099
Caption: power just for Bitcoin that is a

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:11.220
Caption: tremendous amount of energy it uses more

00:12:08.099 --> 00:12:13.139
Caption: energy annually than Argentina and then

00:12:11.219 --> 00:12:15.179
Caption: the second factor that I think is really

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.760
Caption: really important it produces more

00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:21.239
Caption: E-Waste than the Netherlands right so

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:24.660
Caption: Bitcoin is responsible for uh supply

00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:26.940
Caption: shortages in chips ssds and more right

00:12:24.659 --> 00:12:28.619
Caption: so when the PS5 came out and you

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.659
Caption: couldn&#39;t get one I mean obviously covet

00:12:28.619 --> 00:12:33.179
Caption: played a part but it was also due to

00:12:30.659 --> 00:12:36.239
Caption: bitcoin miners using all these chips

00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:37.919
Caption: that&#39;s why people couldn&#39;t get a PS5 and

00:12:36.239 --> 00:12:39.359
Caption: you know personally I don&#39;t want to live

00:12:37.919 --> 00:12:42.059
Caption: in a world where you can&#39;t get a

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:42.719
Caption: PlayStation 5 when you want one

00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:44.278
Caption: um

00:12:42.719 --> 00:12:46.379
Caption: and there&#39;s something else to be said

00:12:44.278 --> 00:12:48.000
Caption: now I&#39;m not going to debate this climate

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.440
Caption: change is real if you don&#39;t believe this

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.239
Caption: then you can ignore this part of the

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.518
Caption: talk but we have to transition to

00:12:51.239 --> 00:12:54.719
Caption: renewable energy in Australia I mean in

00:12:53.518 --> 00:12:56.578
Caption: other countries they may have to use

00:12:54.719 --> 00:12:58.799
Caption: nuclear but in other parts of the world

00:12:56.578 --> 00:13:01.440
Caption: we&#39;ve all got to transition right we

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:03.479
Caption: have to do it and there is only so much

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.039
Caption: energy in the world and one of my

00:13:03.479 --> 00:13:07.260
Caption: arguments here is you really can&#39;t

00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:09.898
Caption: afford to waste energy on a speculative

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:12.540
Caption: system like Bitcoin when we have to

00:13:09.898 --> 00:13:14.578
Caption: transition to save our future and it&#39;s

00:13:12.539 --> 00:13:16.799
Caption: also worth noting that only a few days

00:13:14.578 --> 00:13:18.838
Caption: ago just as I was doing another practice

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:20.278
Caption: the White House tweeted that they are

00:13:18.838 --> 00:13:22.380
Caption: actually looking at proof of work

00:13:20.278 --> 00:13:23.880
Caption: blockchains and considering Banning them

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.320
Caption: because they&#39;re going to prevent them

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.500
Caption: from reaching reaching their

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:31.320
Caption: environmental targets and Bitcoin is

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:34.380
Caption: really bad so many dormant or near

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:38.160
Caption: dormant fossil fuel fired power plants

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.838
Caption: are restarted to mine Bitcoin a power

00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:42.838
Caption: plant in New York increased its

00:13:39.838 --> 00:13:45.000
Caption: emissions by six percent and heated up a

00:13:42.838 --> 00:13:47.219
Caption: local Lake when they started mining

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.200
Caption: Bitcoin and we&#39;re seeing this all the

00:13:47.219 --> 00:13:51.479
Caption: time there&#39;s so much green washing going

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.419
Caption: on we&#39;ve got fossil fuel companies

00:13:51.479 --> 00:13:56.458
Caption: bringing in Big Rigs of Bitcoin Miners

00:13:54.419 --> 00:13:58.078
Caption: and attaching it to gas burn off to

00:13:56.458 --> 00:14:01.518
Caption: power it we&#39;re making fossil fuel

00:13:58.078 --> 00:14:05.338
Caption: companies more profitable

00:14:01.518 --> 00:14:07.380
Caption: so you know inevitably people like Alex

00:14:05.338 --> 00:14:09.119
Caption: keep talking about Bitcoin and which

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.760
Caption: uses proof of work which remember is

00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:14.659
Caption: that complicated algorithm process to

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:17.119
Caption: add a block to a chain now there are

00:14:14.659 --> 00:14:19.500
Caption: environmentally friendly

00:14:17.119 --> 00:14:21.179
Caption: cryptocurrencies as well and they tend

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.859
Caption: to use thing called proof of stake so

00:14:21.179 --> 00:14:24.778
Caption: it&#39;s more efficient because it doesn&#39;t

00:14:22.859 --> 00:14:26.880
Caption: scale in cost and time like proof of

00:14:24.778 --> 00:14:30.838
Caption: work but it does make participation

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:33.898
Caption: expensive so basically validation is

00:14:30.838 --> 00:14:35.940
Caption: achieved by how much a user has to stake

00:14:33.898 --> 00:14:37.799
Caption: so for example you need to hold a

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.260
Caption: certain amount of the crypto or tokens

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:42.179
Caption: to be able to add blocks to the chain so

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.660
Caption: that makes it really easy for someone

00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:48.479
Caption: with a lot of money to own the entire

00:14:45.659 --> 00:14:50.698
Caption: chain which begs the question is it

00:14:48.479 --> 00:14:52.380
Caption: really decentralized then

00:14:50.698 --> 00:14:55.138
Caption: um so it&#39;s not secure as proof of work

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.880
Caption: now ethereum currently uses proof of

00:14:55.138 --> 00:14:58.859
Caption: work and is apparently going to be

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.198

00:14:58.859 --> 00:15:02.698

Caption: month that they&#39;re finally going to do

00:15:04.138 --> 00:15:08.759
Caption: it and it looks like they might actually

00:15:06.359 --> 00:15:10.440
Caption: do it this time and that would make

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:15.119
Caption: ethereum environmentally friendly

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:17.518

00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:19.260

Caption: you know a company raises tokens and

00:15:45.539 --> 00:15:49.739
Caption: then makes a run for the door with

Caption: all these tokens and then they just cash

00:16:10.979 --> 00:16:14.880

00:17:03.838 --> 00:17:06.359
Caption: worth addressing

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.239
Caption: so

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:12.119
Caption: Celsius network is like a Bank savings

00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:14.040
Caption: account except the idea is you put your

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:16.678
Caption: crypto in it so if I have some Bitcoin

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:19.078
Caption: or ethereum I can lend it to Celsius in

00:17:16.678 --> 00:17:21.599
Caption: like their account and they loan it out

00:17:19.078 --> 00:17:23.698
Caption: to other people and I earn interest on

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:26.400

Caption: June and then in July they filed for

00:17:36.359 --> 00:17:41.339
Caption: bankruptcy now they&#39;ve been accused of

00:17:39.178 --> 00:17:43.439
Caption: being a Ponzi scheme but during their

00:17:41.339 --> 00:17:45.839
Caption: bankruptcy hearings people have written

00:17:43.439 --> 00:17:48.418
Caption: in to explain the losses that they&#39;ve

00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:50.819
Caption: suffered now I&#39;ve stayed up late at

Caption: suicide and really dark things now I&#39;ve

00:17:58.079 --> 00:18:02.038
Caption: filtered out some of the darkest ones

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.479
Caption: but I&#39;ve included three that I want to

00:18:02.038 --> 00:18:06.659
Caption: read to you because I feel it&#39;s

00:18:03.479 --> 00:18:09.479

Caption: times that Celsius is safer and better

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.780
Caption: than a bank and those sentiments were

00:19:10.739 --> 00:19:14.819
Caption: reflected in their advertising

Caption: single mother I scrimped and saved for

00:19:42.298 --> 00:19:47.880

Caption: citizen I face kidney dialysis

00:19:52.798 --> 00:19:57.418
Caption: additionally I&#39;ll be forced to sell my

00:19:54.959 --> 00:19:58.798
Caption: home return to work and possibly rely on

00:19:57.418 --> 00:19:59.819
Caption: government relief to make up for this

00:19:58.798 --> 00:20:03.000
Caption: deception

00:19:59.819 --> 00:20:05.159
Caption: now I know that some of you in this room

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.400
Caption: will be thinking hey you should only

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:10.140
Caption: invest what you can afford to lose

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.419
Caption: and I think it&#39;s really really important

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.760
Caption: to hear to point out that that is victim

00:20:12.418 --> 00:20:18.058
Caption: blaming Celsius lied to these people

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:21.058
Caption: they defrauded them they sold them false

00:20:18.058 --> 00:20:23.459
Caption: promises they told them things were safe

00:20:21.058 --> 00:20:26.339
Caption: and their money was in good hands they

00:20:23.459 --> 00:20:27.959
Caption: were lied to so if this pops into your

00:20:26.339 --> 00:20:30.239
Caption: head please just throw it away because

00:20:27.959 --> 00:20:32.880
Caption: it&#39;s an invalid argument it is victim

00:20:30.239 --> 00:20:34.619
Caption: blaming and I think another thing to

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.020
Caption: think about here is we live in a society

00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:39.599
Caption: which isn&#39;t fair there are systems that

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.520
Caption: when you end up in poverty keep you down

00:20:39.599 --> 00:20:43.260
Caption: and the chances are most of you in this

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.660
Caption: room might never have experienced

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.880
Caption: poverty we work in Tech which gives us

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.799
Caption: access to a relatively good lifestyle

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.020
Caption: but the thing is when you&#39;re in poverty

00:20:49.798 --> 00:20:53.219
Caption: all you can do is think about how am I

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.260
Caption: going to get out of this where&#39;s my next

00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:57.298
Caption: meal going to come from and when someone

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.099
Caption: comes along promising the world and

00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.599
Caption: saying to you I&#39;ve got the solution

00:20:59.099 --> 00:21:02.038
Caption: that&#39;s going to break you out of the

00:21:00.599 --> 00:21:04.079
Caption: system that&#39;s going to stop you from

00:21:02.038 --> 00:21:05.879
Caption: being poor you&#39;re going to take that

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:06.659
Caption: because you&#39;re looking for that Ray of

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.940
Caption: Hope

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.739
Caption: so I really hate this whole sentiment

00:21:08.939 --> 00:21:13.019
Caption: that you should only invest what you can

00:21:10.739 --> 00:21:16.079
Caption: afford to lose especially when the

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:18.119
Caption: company is selling the future are lying

00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:20.880
Caption: so yeah look there&#39;s more scams inside

00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:22.678
Caption: of trading so staff at coinbase have

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.020
Caption: been accused of buying tokens before

00:21:22.678 --> 00:21:25.979
Caption: they list so coinbase is a platform

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.159
Caption: where you can buy and sell

00:21:25.979 --> 00:21:31.558
Caption: cryptocurrency uh Ponzi schemes endless

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:34.020
Caption: projects returning profits from new

00:21:31.558 --> 00:21:35.399
Caption: investors to Old investors whilst

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.919
Caption: trading so that&#39;s kind of like where

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.320
Caption: multiple accounts all by the same or

00:21:37.918 --> 00:21:42.719
Caption: multiple people sell nfts between them

00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:44.639
Caption: to inflate the price by the way all of

00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:47.339
Caption: this stuff that I&#39;ve just mentioned

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.919
Caption: with normal security so like stocks and

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:52.859
Caption: bonds and companies it&#39;s against the law

00:21:49.918 --> 00:21:55.619
Caption: if you do insider trading wash trading

00:21:52.859 --> 00:21:57.719
Caption: you go to jail there is a whole

00:21:55.619 --> 00:22:00.239
Caption: regulation industry set up to prevent it

00:21:57.719 --> 00:22:02.038
Caption: and look it doesn&#39;t always work but it&#39;s

00:22:00.239 --> 00:22:04.500
Caption: illegal and the thing is this industry

00:22:02.038 --> 00:22:07.139
Caption: doesn&#39;t have any laws to protect it to

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.839
Caption: protect normal everyday people now we

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:11.940

00:22:17.939 --> 00:22:22.798
Caption: supposed to be liberated by nfts getting

00:22:20.459 --> 00:22:24.839
Caption: angry when their work is stolen and

00:22:22.798 --> 00:22:26.880
Caption: minted and sold as an nft without their

00:22:24.839 --> 00:22:28.739
Caption: permission and I think my favorite part

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.440
Caption: about this is when they go to complain

00:22:28.739 --> 00:22:33.780
Caption: they get laughed at or chastised saying

00:22:31.439 --> 00:22:36.058
Caption: it&#39;s their fault for not doing it sooner

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:38.340
Caption: and being part of the future you know

00:22:36.058 --> 00:22:40.260
Caption: theft because in crypto you know we&#39;re

00:22:38.339 --> 00:22:43.079
Caption: not using Banks you&#39;re supposed to be

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:46.020
Caption: your own bank it&#39;s so easy to scam and

00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:47.699
Caption: fraud people dropping nfts into people&#39;s

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.679
Caption: wallets that when they click it drains

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:52.199
Caption: out all their money

00:22:49.678 --> 00:22:54.178
Caption: now I could really go on about all these

00:22:52.199 --> 00:22:56.579
Caption: but one I&#39;ll be having a classic

00:22:54.178 --> 00:22:58.859
Caption: Alexander rant and two it does get quite

00:22:56.579 --> 00:23:01.019
Caption: depressing but I think it&#39;s worth

00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:03.599
Caption: mentioning here that crypto is zero sum

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.859
Caption: by Design now what does that even mean

00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:07.140
Caption: um I have to admit when someone first

00:23:04.859 --> 00:23:08.280
Caption: explained it to me I was like what but

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.678
Caption: the best way to think about like this

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:13.739
Caption: when you buy a stock in a company

00:23:10.678 --> 00:23:15.479
Caption: the company generates value because it

00:23:13.739 --> 00:23:17.219
Caption: sells a service so it develops a product

00:23:15.479 --> 00:23:19.319
Caption: so more people become interested in it

00:23:17.219 --> 00:23:21.599
Caption: more people buy it so the value grows

00:23:19.319 --> 00:23:24.599
Caption: right so you get value because it&#39;s

00:23:21.599 --> 00:23:26.760
Caption: generated value in crypto that&#39;s not how

00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:28.859
Caption: it works right blockchain doesn&#39;t and

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.739
Caption: Bitcoin don&#39;t generate value not making

00:23:28.859 --> 00:23:35.219
Caption: anything so your only chance to make

00:23:31.739 --> 00:23:37.798
Caption: money is to buy low sell high but

00:23:35.219 --> 00:23:39.959
Caption: because it isn&#39;t generating value when

00:23:37.798 --> 00:23:42.359
Caption: you sell at a high than when you brought

00:23:39.959 --> 00:23:44.939
Caption: you need someone else to put money in

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:46.558
Caption: for you to get out which means it&#39;s zero

00:23:44.939 --> 00:23:48.658
Caption: sum because for you to take money out

00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:51.359
Caption: someone has to put money in but when you

00:23:48.659 --> 00:23:53.520
Caption: take into consideration Miners and

00:23:51.359 --> 00:23:55.558
Caption: exchanges that extract money from the

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.719
Caption: system it makes it strictly negative

00:23:55.558 --> 00:23:59.819
Caption: some which is really weird because we

00:23:57.719 --> 00:24:02.219
Caption: now have this system where we&#39;ve got all

00:23:59.819 --> 00:24:04.319
Caption: these fraud and scams it&#39;s zero sum by

00:24:02.219 --> 00:24:06.599
Caption: design it almost sounds like a

00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:08.279
Caption: multi-level marketing scheme and this

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:11.158
Caption: kind of gets backed up by these

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.840
Caption: wonderful celebrities here doing all

00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:14.580
Caption: these wonderful crypto ads for those of

00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:17.158
Caption: you who&#39;ve not seen it Matt Damon&#39;s ad

00:24:14.579 --> 00:24:19.619
Caption: where he Compares investing in crypto to

00:24:17.159 --> 00:24:22.440
Caption: landing on the moon and basically causes

00:24:19.619 --> 00:24:25.439
Caption: all cowards for not investing has to be

00:24:22.439 --> 00:24:27.959
Caption: the worst advert I&#39;ve ever seen or the

00:24:25.439 --> 00:24:30.839
Caption: Larry Super Bowl ad Don&#39;t Be Like Larry

00:24:27.959 --> 00:24:32.880
Caption: start investing today or Paris Hilton on

00:24:30.839 --> 00:24:34.500
Caption: late night talking about their nfts

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.020
Caption: because this is the thing it doesn&#39;t

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:39.479
Caption: generate value so to keep money coming

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:42.900
Caption: in they have to keep the hype train

00:24:39.479 --> 00:24:45.959
Caption: going otherwise it stops

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.400
Caption: so let&#39;s explore this decentralized uh

00:24:45.959 --> 00:24:48.298
Caption: things we&#39;re going to shift Lanes a

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.000
Caption: little bit here so we&#39;ve talked about

00:24:48.298 --> 00:24:53.279
Caption: the fraud and scams and things but let&#39;s

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.500
Caption: talk about decentralized so that&#39;s

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.539
Caption: that&#39;s one of the big touts that it&#39;s

00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:00.239
Caption: decentralized we own it it&#39;s not owned

00:24:57.538 --> 00:25:03.119
Caption: by people but most of the major services

00:25:00.239 --> 00:25:05.880
Caption: in the web 3 space are run on

00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:09.119
Caption: centralized servers and just query the

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:11.640
Caption: blockchain with an API if a miner owns

00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:13.140
Caption: 51 of a network is it really

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.178
Caption: decentralized

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.859
Caption: and these are things that are all worth

00:25:15.178 --> 00:25:18.599
Caption: thinking if you have to have a bank

00:25:16.859 --> 00:25:21.058
Caption: account and go through a centralized

00:25:18.599 --> 00:25:23.880
Caption: exchange to use a web 3 app

00:25:21.058 --> 00:25:25.739
Caption: is it decentralized I have to admit I

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.298
Caption: set up a metamask wallet myself and it

00:25:25.739 --> 00:25:29.219
Caption: took me about half an hour and I&#39;m a

00:25:27.298 --> 00:25:31.319
Caption: developer so God knows how we&#39;re going

00:25:29.219 --> 00:25:32.640
Caption: to get normal people to do it

00:25:31.319 --> 00:25:34.380
Caption: so that&#39;s

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.479
Caption: actually here sort of helps move my

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.918
Caption: decentralized argument so Moxie is one

00:25:36.479 --> 00:25:40.319
Caption: of the founders of signals so he created

00:25:37.918 --> 00:25:42.599
Caption: this nft if you want to go figure out

00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:44.639
Caption: how he did it it&#39;s up on his Twitter but

00:25:42.599 --> 00:25:46.918
Caption: basically it looked different based on

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:50.039
Caption: where you viewed it so if you viewed it

00:25:46.918 --> 00:25:52.918
Caption: on openc one of the biggest centralized

00:25:50.038 --> 00:25:55.019
Caption: platforms for buying and selling nfts it

00:25:52.918 --> 00:25:56.639
Caption: looked one way and if you looked at it

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.859
Caption: on variable another but if you looked at

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.619
Caption: it in your crypto wallet it rendered out

00:25:58.859 --> 00:26:02.880
Caption: as a poo Emoji which is just absolutely

00:26:01.619 --> 00:26:06.058
Caption: fantastic

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.579
Caption: but this is funny he was delisted from

00:26:06.058 --> 00:26:10.380
Caption: Open Sea for violating their terms and

00:26:08.579 --> 00:26:12.959
Caption: conditions but I thought it was a

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:14.819
Caption: censorship-free decentralized system but

00:26:12.959 --> 00:26:17.399
Caption: it gets even better then his crypto

00:26:14.819 --> 00:26:19.500
Caption: wallet stopped showing the nft because

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.500
Caption: it turns out his crypto wallet just

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:25.558
Caption: queried Open Seas API to check for the

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:27.298
Caption: nft&#39;s Existence so none of that is

00:26:25.558 --> 00:26:29.880
Caption: decentralized that&#39;s all using

00:26:27.298 --> 00:26:32.099
Caption: centralized services

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.319
Caption: so let&#39;s dig into censorship resistance

00:26:32.099 --> 00:26:38.099
Caption: a little bit now I want to start by

00:26:34.319 --> 00:26:41.278
Caption: saying I am a firm believer in freedom

00:26:38.099 --> 00:26:43.380
Caption: of speech you have the right to say

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:45.000
Caption: whatever you want and I think that

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.798
Caption: should be right and it&#39;s very depressing

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.500
Caption: in other countries where governments use

00:26:46.798 --> 00:26:51.959
Caption: their power to suppress that but the

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.538
Caption: thing is freedom of speech does not give

00:26:51.959 --> 00:26:56.339
Caption: you freedom of consequences and also

00:26:54.538 --> 00:26:58.139
Caption: using your freedom of speech to suppress

00:26:56.339 --> 00:27:00.538
Caption: other people&#39;s freedom of speech is

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:02.400
Caption: plain wrong and I think we need to talk

00:27:00.538 --> 00:27:04.678
Caption: about this censorship resistant

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.779
Caption: blockchain because the thing is there is

00:27:04.678 --> 00:27:09.359
Caption: stuff out there that needs censoring

00:27:06.779 --> 00:27:11.460
Caption: right since content moderators that work

00:27:09.359 --> 00:27:13.140
Caption: for YouTube Facebook and Twitter they

00:27:11.459 --> 00:27:15.359
Caption: don&#39;t last very long in their jobs

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:18.659
Caption: censoring the content that gets uploaded

00:27:15.359 --> 00:27:20.640
Caption: and they see the worst of humanity there

00:27:18.659 --> 00:27:24.120
Caption: are some dark places in our society

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:26.700
Caption: child porn animal violence this stuff is

00:27:24.119 --> 00:27:29.819
Caption: real and it happens all the time and

00:27:26.699 --> 00:27:33.178
Caption: needs to be censored if we create a cent

00:27:29.819 --> 00:27:35.219
Caption: censorship resistant complete system we

00:27:33.178 --> 00:27:39.658
Caption: are going to allow child pornography

00:27:35.219 --> 00:27:42.839
Caption: hate racism to just spew out all online

00:27:39.659 --> 00:27:44.580
Caption: which isn&#39;t really a great place

00:27:42.839 --> 00:27:46.558
Caption: and let&#39;s expand on that a little bit

00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:49.260
Caption: and talk about the death of privacy so

00:27:46.558 --> 00:27:51.959
Caption: I&#39;m a big privacy Advocate I go out of

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.640
Caption: my way at the startup I work at to try

00:27:51.959 --> 00:27:56.640
Caption: and respect privacy as much as possible

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:59.700
Caption: even building analytics in a different

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:01.859
Caption: way all that sort of stuff and privacy

00:27:59.699 --> 00:28:04.678
Caption: is important and blockchain often gets

00:28:01.859 --> 00:28:06.058
Caption: touted as it&#39;s more secure it&#39;s the data

00:28:04.678 --> 00:28:08.519
Caption: in your hands and look we should have

00:28:06.058 --> 00:28:10.678
Caption: data in our hands I agree with that but

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:13.200
Caption: the thing is it&#39;s not really private

00:28:10.678 --> 00:28:16.739
Caption: because I cannot stress this enough it&#39;s

00:28:13.199 --> 00:28:19.319
Caption: a public Ledger everything you do is

00:28:16.739 --> 00:28:21.359
Caption: visible to the public now if you don&#39;t

00:28:19.319 --> 00:28:23.759
Caption: connect that identity to anything in the

00:28:21.359 --> 00:28:26.579
Caption: real world sure it gives you the ability

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.919
Caption: to harass and annoy and disappear right

00:28:26.579 --> 00:28:31.079
Caption: but the second you start connecting it

00:28:28.918 --> 00:28:33.239
Caption: to anything in the real world or someone

00:28:31.079 --> 00:28:35.640
Caption: figures out that that wallet belongs to

00:28:33.239 --> 00:28:37.739
Caption: you everything you do is going to be

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.799
Caption: available for everyone to see we&#39;re

00:28:37.739 --> 00:28:42.418
Caption: talking privacy violations way worse

00:28:40.798 --> 00:28:45.178
Caption: than Google and Facebook have ever

00:28:42.418 --> 00:28:47.278
Caption: committed it especially when you&#39;ve got

00:28:45.178 --> 00:28:50.339
Caption: things like this I

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:52.860
Caption: ethereum co-founder says we&#39;ll soon use

00:28:50.339 --> 00:28:55.319
Caption: Soul bound tokens to verify things like

00:28:52.859 --> 00:28:57.178
Caption: school and employment all stored in a

00:28:55.319 --> 00:28:58.500
Caption: Soul&#39;s wallet I don&#39;t even know what any

00:28:57.178 --> 00:29:00.959
Caption: of that means

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.760
Caption: but the thing is once we start attaching

00:29:00.959 --> 00:29:04.319
Caption: things like that to the blockchain

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.140
Caption: that&#39;s there forever because remember it

00:29:04.319 --> 00:29:09.479
Caption: can&#39;t be deleted even if it&#39;s fought it

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.099
Caption: can still be found you know accidentally

00:29:09.479 --> 00:29:12.900
Caption: take a photo with your credit card in

00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:15.479
Caption: the background that&#39;s up there forever

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:18.119
Caption: somebody uploads Revenge point of view

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:19.979
Caption: that&#39;s up there forever it&#39;s never going

00:29:18.119 --> 00:29:22.260
Caption: away and I think there&#39;s another thing

00:29:19.979 --> 00:29:24.058
Caption: worth mentioning is that most of the

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:26.699
Caption: people working in this space are

00:29:24.058 --> 00:29:29.819
Caption: straight white men like me and we don&#39;t

00:29:26.699 --> 00:29:32.459
Caption: experience harassment stalking in the

00:29:29.819 --> 00:29:35.339
Caption: same way that people of color or women

00:29:32.459 --> 00:29:38.278
Caption: do we just don&#39;t and the thing is that

00:29:35.339 --> 00:29:41.099
Caption: stuff will become easier to do like I

00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:43.440
Caption: said privacy will disappear

00:29:41.099 --> 00:29:45.719
Caption: so we&#39;re running short on time because

00:29:43.439 --> 00:29:47.459
Caption: we start a little bit late so let&#39;s just

00:29:45.719 --> 00:29:48.959
Caption: just cool off a little bit Alex and

00:29:47.459 --> 00:29:50.158
Caption: we&#39;ll go into financialization of

00:29:48.959 --> 00:29:52.199
Caption: everything

00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:54.600
Caption: um so so one of the end goals of the web

00:29:52.199 --> 00:29:56.158
Caption: three space right is that everything is

00:29:54.599 --> 00:29:58.319
Caption: on the Chain everything you do is on the

00:29:56.159 --> 00:30:01.140
Caption: chamber incentivized for our time with

00:29:58.319 --> 00:30:03.359
Caption: earning tokens uh you pay for everything

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:06.299
Caption: on the chain and I think one real good

00:30:03.359 --> 00:30:09.119
Caption: example of this is axi infinity which is

00:30:06.298 --> 00:30:11.099
Caption: a video game using nfts and blockchains

00:30:09.119 --> 00:30:13.260
Caption: it&#39;s pretty much just Pokemon it&#39;s

00:30:11.099 --> 00:30:14.880
Caption: Pokemon with nfts

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.520
Caption: um so the way it works is you buy a rent

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.380
Caption: three nfts called axes

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.479
Caption: um and then you battle them and you earn

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:23.579
Caption: tokens for battling and you use those

00:30:21.479 --> 00:30:26.278
Caption: tokens to breed more axes or you can

00:30:23.579 --> 00:30:27.839
Caption: cash out for real money

00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:29.340
Caption: um now it&#39;s very expensive to get

00:30:27.839 --> 00:30:30.898
Caption: started like when it first started it

00:30:29.339 --> 00:30:32.579
Caption: was very low it can it cost a few

00:30:30.899 --> 00:30:34.980
Caption: hundred dollars at least to set up one

00:30:32.579 --> 00:30:36.658
Caption: team one thing you can do is set up a

00:30:34.979 --> 00:30:38.640
Caption: bunch of teams and rent them out to

00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:40.740
Caption: people and then you earn fifty percent

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.719
Caption: of whatever they&#39;re doing now they&#39;ve

00:30:40.739 --> 00:30:44.520
Caption: got a lot of good press

00:30:42.719 --> 00:30:46.020
Caption: about how they help people in the

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.820
Caption: Philippines earn money you know it&#39;s

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.799
Caption: like hey these people are now earning

00:30:47.819 --> 00:30:52.019
Caption: money you know playing a video game but

00:30:49.798 --> 00:30:54.000
Caption: the thing is play to earn is not play to

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.679
Caption: have fun so when we had the crypto crash

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.319
Caption: earlier this year they saw their player

00:30:55.678 --> 00:30:59.819
Caption: numbers drop massively because people

00:30:58.319 --> 00:31:02.038
Caption: were just using it to earn money they

00:30:59.819 --> 00:31:03.359
Caption: were just grinding to earn money and

00:31:02.038 --> 00:31:05.158
Caption: when you take into consideration there&#39;s

00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:07.798
Caption: lots of whales so that&#39;s people with

00:31:05.159 --> 00:31:10.799
Caption: lots of money renting out nfts earning

00:31:07.798 --> 00:31:12.359
Caption: 50 of the money they&#39;re earning it

00:31:10.798 --> 00:31:15.418
Caption: almost sounds a bit like a sweat Factory

00:31:12.359 --> 00:31:17.459
Caption: but let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s investigate that

00:31:15.418 --> 00:31:19.859
Caption: good press on how many people in the

00:31:17.459 --> 00:31:22.619
Caption: Philippines make money earning you know

00:31:19.859 --> 00:31:24.178
Caption: earning playing the game only 23 of

00:31:22.619 --> 00:31:27.119
Caption: adults in the Philippines have a bank

00:31:24.178 --> 00:31:29.219
Caption: account right so remember you need a

00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:31.678
Caption: bank account to buy crypto and play

00:31:29.219 --> 00:31:33.778
Caption: crypto and work with crypto so how many

00:31:31.678 --> 00:31:35.219
Caption: people are we actually helping I feel

00:31:33.779 --> 00:31:37.500
Caption: that&#39;s one of the things that we do in

00:31:35.219 --> 00:31:39.839
Caption: Tech a lot it&#39;s like this solves this

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.640
Caption: problem we should do it but we never

00:31:39.839 --> 00:31:44.278
Caption: actually talk to the people we say we&#39;re

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:46.500
Caption: helping you know and I think a example

00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:48.600
Caption: outside of the web 3 space and you might

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.579
Caption: hate me for this and this is okay is

00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:52.798
Caption: Elon Musk satellite system for internet

00:31:50.579 --> 00:31:55.439
Caption: right like he&#39;s like oh we&#39;re bringing

00:31:52.798 --> 00:31:57.418
Caption: internet to people in the regions have

00:31:55.439 --> 00:31:59.398
Caption: we asked them what they want is internet

00:31:57.418 --> 00:32:01.019
Caption: top of their list I&#39;m pretty sure that

00:31:59.399 --> 00:32:03.600
Caption: if you talk to most people living in the

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:05.940
Caption: regions they&#39;d be like uh 24-hour access

00:32:03.599 --> 00:32:07.918
Caption: to doctors and nurses more public

00:32:05.939 --> 00:32:09.898
Caption: services and infrastructure that isn&#39;t

00:32:07.918 --> 00:32:11.819
Caption: falling apart and 50 years old you know

00:32:09.899 --> 00:32:13.080
Caption: not saying the Internet isn&#39;t important

00:32:11.819 --> 00:32:14.639
Caption: but it&#39;s one of those things where like

00:32:13.079 --> 00:32:16.260
Caption: let&#39;s just shove a whole bunch of

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.058
Caption: satellites in the atmosphere every year

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.558
Caption: and not think about the consequences

00:32:18.058 --> 00:32:21.839
Caption: because apparently we&#39;re doing doing

00:32:19.558 --> 00:32:24.000
Caption: some good

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:26.819
Caption: and in the end it&#39;s people that lose

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.739
Caption: right like it&#39;s people that get left out

00:32:26.819 --> 00:32:30.538
Caption: it&#39;s people that suffer the consequences

00:32:28.739 --> 00:32:32.579
Caption: of us just charging ahead and doing

00:32:30.538 --> 00:32:34.798
Caption: something I think not a week goes by

00:32:32.579 --> 00:32:36.658
Caption: where people aren&#39;t like oh let&#39;s stick

00:32:34.798 --> 00:32:39.000
Caption: this on the blockchain for example let&#39;s

00:32:36.659 --> 00:32:40.559
Caption: put power distribution and on the

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.140
Caption: blockchain that will make things better

00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:45.239
Caption: but then who decides when we disconnect

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:47.219
Caption: someone when they&#39;re struggling with

00:32:45.239 --> 00:32:49.140
Caption: finances who decides that we keep

00:32:47.219 --> 00:32:52.380
Caption: someone connected to the power because

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:55.020
Caption: they&#39;ve got medical devices if we create

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:57.000
Caption: this decentralized system a really good

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.279
Caption: example is if you take Synergy or

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.899
Caption: state-owned power company and you

00:32:59.279 --> 00:33:02.940
Caption: compare it that to all the private

00:33:00.899 --> 00:33:04.440
Caption: companies over East which is a little

00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:05.879
Caption: bit like a blockchain they&#39;ve all don&#39;t

00:33:04.439 --> 00:33:08.219
Caption: really work together that well they all

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.359
Caption: do whatever they want our disconnection

00:33:08.219 --> 00:33:13.018
Caption: rate

00:33:09.359 --> 00:33:15.359
Caption: our disconnection rate in wa for people

00:33:13.019 --> 00:33:17.460
Caption: in financial hardship is much lower

00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:19.079
Caption: because we have a centralized system

00:33:17.459 --> 00:33:21.298
Caption: working together

00:33:19.079 --> 00:33:22.859
Caption: you know look at Myspace the environment

00:33:21.298 --> 00:33:25.380
Caption: space everyone&#39;s like oh if we put

00:33:22.859 --> 00:33:27.839
Caption: offsets on the blockchain it fixes them

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.339
Caption: you know we need carbon offsets to

00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:31.079
Caption: offset some emissions that are

00:33:29.339 --> 00:33:34.678
Caption: unavoidable but the thing is the

00:33:31.079 --> 00:33:36.479
Caption: industry is Rife with lies fraud kicking

00:33:34.678 --> 00:33:38.518
Caption: people off their own land in third world

00:33:36.479 --> 00:33:40.260
Caption: countries and the thing is how does

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:42.659
Caption: sticking that on the blockchain fix it

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.699
Caption: one it doesn&#39;t stop people lying before

00:33:42.659 --> 00:33:46.559
Caption: they put data in there and all it does

00:33:44.699 --> 00:33:47.880
Caption: is create another Financial Market on

00:33:46.558 --> 00:33:49.558
Caption: top of the other

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.239
Caption: and I think that&#39;s the biggest thing

00:33:49.558 --> 00:33:54.000
Caption: that I want you guys to take away from

00:33:51.239 --> 00:33:57.000
Caption: this is that Tech alone isn&#39;t going to

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.339
Caption: save us we have to actually trust each

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.260
Caption: other and work together and stop just

00:33:59.339 --> 00:34:03.119
Caption: pushing ahead with tech because it seems

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:05.820
Caption: cool or fun

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:08.520
Caption: so please just remember we can trust

00:34:05.819 --> 00:34:11.638
Caption: each other we can work together and

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:13.678
Caption: centralized systems are important too

00:34:11.638 --> 00:34:15.299
Caption: I&#39;d like to thank some of these amazing

00:34:13.678 --> 00:34:17.598
Caption: people that I got some of the content

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:20.459
Caption: for this talk from because I feel like

00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:21.960
Caption: although I read and work in this space a

00:34:20.459 --> 00:34:24.358
Caption: bit these people are far more

00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:26.760
Caption: experienced than I am Molly Y in

00:34:24.358 --> 00:34:28.858
Caption: particular is probably the coolest

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:31.020
Caption: person you could ever meet and kicking

00:34:28.858 --> 00:34:33.059
Caption: ass and documenting some of the terrible

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:35.339
Caption: things happening in this space

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:38.159
Caption: and I&#39;d also like to thank our sponsors

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:38.690
Caption: uh for today at DD Perth thank you very

00:34:38.158 --> 00:34:45.439

Caption: thank you Alex

00:34:47.878 --> 00:34:51.118
Caption: um we&#39;ve got about five minutes before

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:54.540
Caption: there&#39;s morning tea in all the foyers

00:34:51.118 --> 00:34:56.519
Caption: the next session is starting at 11 25 so

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:59.760
Caption: is there anyone who&#39;s got a question for

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:03.560
Caption: Alex before we wrap up

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.560
Caption: cool oh dear

00:35:05.879 --> 00:35:12.719
Caption: so the hype Train&#39;s real how do we get

00:35:08.879 --> 00:35:15.479
Caption: investors in startups to avoid throwing

00:35:12.719 --> 00:35:18.300
Caption: cash at shiny things that have web3 and

00:35:15.479 --> 00:35:19.800
Caption: crypto in them oh see so that&#39;s a

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.839
Caption: difficult question right and I don&#39;t

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:24.179
Caption: have a perfect answer for that

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:25.619
Caption: um because I work for a startup too and

00:35:24.179 --> 00:35:27.659
Caption: I&#39;ve seen other companies just come

00:35:25.618 --> 00:35:29.879
Caption: along with a wild idea get millions of

00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:32.039
Caption: dollars and we only ever got a few

00:35:29.879 --> 00:35:33.719
Caption: hundred thousand to start with so I

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.760
Caption: think I think there&#39;s that thing where

00:35:33.719 --> 00:35:37.618
Caption: it&#39;s like you have to look at is endless

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.599
Caption: growth always a good thing can I

00:35:37.618 --> 00:35:42.539
Caption: bootstrap a startup with income first

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:44.520
Caption: before I go to investors and just try

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.020
Caption: and avoid those investors which means

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.780
Caption: less stuff will be built that doesn&#39;t

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.339
Caption: have web 3 but hey maybe we have a

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.239
Caption: slightly better Society for it as well

00:35:50.339 --> 00:35:55.140
Caption: too

00:35:51.239 --> 00:35:57.839
Caption: or Samantha any other questions

00:35:55.139 --> 00:36:00.059
Caption: yeah just be curious in your opinion on

00:35:57.839 --> 00:36:01.619
Caption: whether there exists maybe a possibility

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.300
Caption: for some sort of decentralized financial

00:36:01.618 --> 00:36:04.739
Caption: product for example I&#39;m thinking of the

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:07.560
Caption: problems on the internet with a

00:36:04.739 --> 00:36:11.098
Caption: MasterCard and Visa strangle on certain

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:12.900
Caption: services and yeah so I do have an answer

00:36:11.099 --> 00:36:14.579
Caption: for this and some of you might not like

00:36:12.899 --> 00:36:17.279
Caption: it so

00:36:14.579 --> 00:36:19.440
Caption: I agree things like internet and payment

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.540
Caption: actually internet infrastructure not

00:36:19.439 --> 00:36:24.358
Caption: just payment infrastructure is a

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:26.959
Caption: necessary for today&#39;s world right just

00:36:24.358 --> 00:36:29.939
Caption: like electricity and water and necessity

00:36:26.959 --> 00:36:33.060
Caption: so maybe it&#39;s time that certain

00:36:29.939 --> 00:36:36.060
Caption: infrastructure isn&#39;t actually owned by

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:38.219
Caption: private companies anymore but actually a

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.320
Caption: public owned good now look yeah

00:36:38.219 --> 00:36:42.300
Caption: governments have some bad reputations

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.400
Caption: for running things but the thing is

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:47.040
Caption: maybe that&#39;s actually what starts the

00:36:44.399 --> 00:36:49.379
Caption: need to happen maybe we need a publicly

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.839
Caption: owned payment infrastructure maybe we

00:36:49.379 --> 00:36:53.039
Caption: need publicly owned infinite internet

00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:55.079
Caption: internet and server infrastructure

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.359
Caption: because the thing is we actually need it

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:58.859
Caption: to function and maybe it&#39;s time we

00:36:57.358 --> 00:37:01.199
Caption: modernize our governments a little bit

00:36:58.858 --> 00:37:04.078
Caption: to make that possible

00:37:01.199 --> 00:37:07.219
Caption: thank you fantastic uh any other

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:07.220
Caption: questions down front

00:37:10.439 --> 00:37:14.760
Caption: um I was just going to ask so obviously

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:16.560
Caption: in the late 90s we had the the.com

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.000
Caption: bubble where a bunch of companies went

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.680
Caption: on the internet and they didn&#39;t have to

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.020
Caption: and everything just kind of went

00:37:19.679 --> 00:37:23.819
Caption: straight down downhill from there yeah

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.859
Caption: but obviously the underlying technology

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:28.680
Caption: was somewhat useful in the modern world

00:37:25.858 --> 00:37:30.959
Caption: so do you feel the whole system of web 3

00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:33.179
Caption: as a whole is completely useless or is

00:37:30.959 --> 00:37:37.439
Caption: it more that it&#39;s kind of the wild wild

00:37:33.179 --> 00:37:38.819
Caption: rest right now I personally I agree that

00:37:37.439 --> 00:37:40.379
Caption: it is useless but that&#39;s my personal

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:42.300
Caption: opinion and I I disagree with the Wild

00:37:40.379 --> 00:37:44.399
Caption: Wild West because although there was a

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:46.500
Caption: bit of Wawa West when the.com bubble

00:37:44.399 --> 00:37:48.479
Caption: happened there wasn&#39;t this level of

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.159
Caption: Fraud and scams right that&#39;s that&#39;s this

00:37:48.479 --> 00:37:52.379
Caption: is insane like if this was happening in

00:37:50.159 --> 00:37:53.879
Caption: the banking industry on a daily basis it

00:37:52.379 --> 00:37:56.098
Caption: would be on the news every night right

00:37:53.879 --> 00:37:57.719
Caption: like it&#39;s and and the thing is look

00:37:56.099 --> 00:37:59.400
Caption: maybe there is a use for blockchain that

00:37:57.719 --> 00:38:01.199
Caption: I&#39;m not aware of right that we could

00:37:59.399 --> 00:38:02.219
Caption: actually do but technically don&#39;t we

00:38:01.199 --> 00:38:05.399
Caption: already have that and I think it&#39;s

00:38:02.219 --> 00:38:08.399
Caption: called get you know like it&#39;s uh like

00:38:05.399 --> 00:38:10.139
Caption: maybe we already found the use case

00:38:08.399 --> 00:38:12.419
Caption: um look I just I just want people to to

00:38:10.139 --> 00:38:14.519
Caption: be protected so you know really I think

00:38:12.419 --> 00:38:16.199
Caption: the industry should be regulated and I

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.939
Caption: think you&#39;d find if that happened it

00:38:16.199 --> 00:38:20.760
Caption: would probably mostly disappear because

00:38:17.939 --> 00:38:25.520
Caption: like I said it&#39;s zero-sum by Design

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.520
Caption: awesome uh one last question over here

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:31.739
Caption: so you talked about uh public ownership

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:33.540
Caption: or government ownership is there any

00:38:31.739 --> 00:38:35.939
Caption: initiatives like that

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.939
Caption: they&#39;ve started or are they thinking

00:38:35.939 --> 00:38:40.679
Caption: about it no no there isn&#39;t which sucks

00:38:38.939 --> 00:38:42.719
Caption: right I mean there are some people in

00:38:40.679 --> 00:38:44.399
Caption: America talking about it

00:38:42.719 --> 00:38:46.139
Caption: um but I think that&#39;s actually what

00:38:44.399 --> 00:38:48.299
Caption: needs to happen right we need to stop

00:38:46.139 --> 00:38:49.979
Caption: saying oh you know government&#39;s terrible

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.599
Caption: at running this well let&#39;s make a

00:38:49.979 --> 00:38:53.399
Caption: government good at running this right I

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:55.500
Caption: know people push for privatization of

00:38:53.399 --> 00:38:57.000
Caption: synergy and look we&#39;re delving into my

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.858
Caption: personal beliefs a little bit here but

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.419
Caption: that&#39;s okay and you&#39;re allowed to

00:38:58.858 --> 00:39:02.338
Caption: disagree with me but I believe our

00:39:00.419 --> 00:39:04.739
Caption: energy should be stay owned you know it

00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:06.839
Caption: kept our power prices lower most of the

00:39:04.739 --> 00:39:08.520
Caption: time it leads to better things this

00:39:06.839 --> 00:39:10.380
Caption: whole thing of choice in certain things

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.359
Caption: is important but when it&#39;s

00:39:10.379 --> 00:39:14.039
Caption: infrastructure so really maybe working

00:39:12.358 --> 00:39:17.399
Caption: in the tech space we should all start

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:19.919
Caption: pushing for that because it is needed

00:39:17.399 --> 00:39:22.078
Caption: awesome and uh can we give another round
