Caption: got to mix the two and look at trading

00:01:42.658 --> 00:01:46.798
Caption: models and one of the things I learned

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.019
Caption: from that was trying to capture

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.880
Caption: sentiment how does how do people feel

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:52.919

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:54.419
Caption: out positive information is the stock

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:55.798
Caption: price going to go up because people

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:57.180
Caption: trust the company so what&#39;s the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.500
Caption: sentiment towards it and trying to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.819
Caption: capture that in a data sense it&#39;s

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.559
Caption: actually incredibly difficult I can&#39;t

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.259
Caption: really put a survey out so how do you

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:05.398
Caption: how do you capture it and further to

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.259
Caption: that is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.598
Caption: um I was like inventing new things and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.279
Caption: launching new ideas and so in the

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:12.598
Caption: finance space I was I started something

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.339
Caption: called Blue Harvest but I need to Market

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:15.720
Caption: it I know nothing about marketing I&#39;m a

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.458
Caption: programmer luckily I have friends who

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.598
Caption: are marketers you&#39;ve got to explain you

00:02:17.458 --> 00:02:20.759
Caption: know look at this look at that so I

00:02:18.598 --> 00:02:22.559
Caption: actually got to learn but I&#39;m time poor

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:25.019
Caption: so I need to automate it how do I Market

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.580
Caption: automate my marketing right it&#39;s a dream

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.400
Caption: next thing is in the startup world I&#39;ve

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.800
Caption: got no money right so free or cheap

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:34.019
Caption: if I can do that too even better

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.639
Caption: and the third component is video content

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.958
Caption: it&#39;s got to be video content if you look

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.000
Caption: at Tick Tock it&#39;s exploding you know

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.378
Caption: people writing texts stories posts

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.958
Caption: whatever it doesn&#39;t seem to be as

00:02:40.378 --> 00:02:45.419
Caption: popular anymore as video content so need

00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:48.119
Caption: to automate it needs to be free I need

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:49.440
Caption: to make videos so pretty tall order but

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:50.639
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s the challenge I set myself

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.559
Caption: because at the end of the day if I&#39;m

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.819
Caption: launching something I need I need

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:57.720
Caption: marketing otherwise you go nowhere right

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.419
Caption: business fails no matter how good it is

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.979
Caption: so today I want to discuss is um just a

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.779
Caption: quick one through social media Concepts

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.860
Caption: and numbers just some terms

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.419
Caption: um that you&#39;ve probably heard in social

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.559
Caption: media just explain a bit more and then

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.958
Caption: some numbers around it so you can get an

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:12.919
Caption: appreciation of how that works in the

00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:15.360
Caption: social media space and what they mean

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:17.458
Caption: next thing is data Baseline so let&#39;s

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.800
Caption: capture some data from let&#39;s call it my

00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:21.958
Caption: visibility in social media or of this um

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.158
Caption: this blue harvesting I&#39;d written and how

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.139
Caption: you know measure that as a starting

00:03:23.158 --> 00:03:27.179
Caption: point and do I succeed do I get more

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.759
Caption: free marketing

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:31.139
Caption: and the next piece is deep fakes so

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.518
Caption: that&#39;s the idea of using that video

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.658
Caption: content you know synthetic media is

00:03:32.518 --> 00:03:36.238
Caption: another term and I&#39;ll get into that

00:03:33.658 --> 00:03:37.800
Caption: later but deep fakes how do we use these

00:03:36.238 --> 00:03:39.479
Caption: videos how can we automate video um

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.400
Caption: production

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.720
Caption: and the net result did it work did it

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:44.339
Caption: just tank and did I waste my money in my

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.199
Caption: time

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:48.298
Caption: so let&#39;s get going

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:50.279
Caption: so first off social media people know

00:03:48.298 --> 00:03:51.479
Caption: what impressions are yeah someone looked

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:53.039
Caption: at your cat video that&#39;s an impression

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:55.619
Caption: right picture of your kid that&#39;s an

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:57.119
Caption: impression engagement

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:59.279
Caption: yeah that&#39;s when someone pressed like

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:00.839
Caption: repost retweet

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.039
Caption: um I can&#39;t think of another nerd but you

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:04.199
Caption: know those things they&#39;ve interacted

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:06.059
Caption: with your with your social media content

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.639
Caption: whatever that may be

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:11.158
Caption: followers yeah he influences bang on

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.598
Caption: about followers so and Donald Trump will

00:04:11.158 --> 00:04:13.500
Caption: tell you with 90 million of them I used

00:04:12.598 --> 00:04:14.878
Caption: to have

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.859
Caption: um when you put out a piece of content

00:04:14.878 --> 00:04:18.660
Caption: immediately all your followers get to

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.579
Caption: see it that&#39;s the first group of people

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.979
Caption: that see it then after you after they

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.660
Caption: like retweet whatever then out it goes

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.459
Caption: so really followers help you project

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.019
Caption: your posts so really increasing

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:30.059
Caption: followers and some people play for them

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:31.859
Caption: is very important so that&#39;s another

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:33.540
Caption: number to consider

00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:35.939
Caption: and the last thing I wanted to um

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.500
Caption: explain there is organic versus paid so

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.239
Caption: organic is you taking a picture of your

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.639
Caption: cat and sticking it on wherever it was

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:44.339
Caption: Instagram whereas paid some people pay

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.660
Caption: content writers advertising um the

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:47.279
Caption: company I now work for actually does

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.720
Caption: that sort of stuff makes social media

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.919
Caption: posts for companies

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.899
Caption: um so there&#39;s a whole Market in that

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.059
Caption: space and can be quite expensive even

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:56.040
Caption: Simple Text posts with photos take money

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:58.259
Caption: and time

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.360
Caption: so engagement rates which you heard me

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.739
Caption: just discuss previously so just to keep

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:03.899
Caption: the math simple Twitter&#39;s a one percent

00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:05.940
Caption: that&#39;s considered a good engagement rate

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:08.399
Caption: oh sorry my slides are now out of it

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.500
Caption: that&#39;s a good engagement rate so what

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:13.139
Caption: that means is if you had 100 people see

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.019
Caption: your your cat tweet and one person hit

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.540
Caption: like or retweet or whatever that&#39;s good

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:20.879
Caption: right that&#39;s considered a good number I

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.440
Caption: know sounds crappy but it&#39;s good and you

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.539
Caption: can see along there there&#39;s LinkedIn at

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.339
Caption: six and so on so forth so just to keep

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.619
Caption: the maths easy one person a hundred is

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:30.660
Caption: considered success on Twitter

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:32.699
Caption: so next piece is how much are people

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.220
Caption: spending on marketing

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.479
Caption: so Twitter 1.4 billion dollars in

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.959
Caption: advertising

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.600
Caption: um profit last calendar year us

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:45.539
Caption: Facebook at 50 billion and number number

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.699
Caption: one is Google 200 billion dollars in

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.739
Caption: advertising so it&#39;s a fair whack of

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:53.639
Caption: money and if I can avoid giving them any

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:56.279
Caption: more I um certainly will try

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.899
Caption: so video content so what are some stats

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.979
Caption: around video content what what makes us

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.679
Caption: so popular

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.539
Caption: so the first thing is 78 of people watch

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:05.399
Caption: online videos every week and that&#39;s in

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.979
Caption: some form whether it&#39;s you know autoplay

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:09.899
Caption: on Twitter or Tick Tock whatever

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.959
Caption: um it&#39;s it&#39;s incredibly popular

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:14.399
Caption: the next two thing uh next stat is 72 of

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:16.380
Caption: customers rather learn this way so let&#39;s

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:17.699
Caption: think of my dad building his lawn Murray

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.320
Caption: just bought the other week we found a

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.239
Caption: video online on how to build it because

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.559
Caption: reading a manual sucks whereas if

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:24.720
Caption: someone shows you how to do it you can

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:26.579
Caption: always learn faster and acquire the

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.860
Caption: skills or knowledge faster

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:31.079
Caption: the next one is message retention more

Caption: other Concepts I talked about so you can

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:18.479

00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:20.640

Caption: eight percent engagement

00:09:23.219 --> 00:09:26.579

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.380

Caption: site I think it&#39;s a whole other

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.559
Caption: experiment

00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:32.940
Caption: but the point is that you can see

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:34.679
Caption: there&#39;s a high level of Engagement with

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.539
Caption: certain stocks and I&#39;ve just grabbed the

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:38.518
Caption: top dozen there just to show you

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:39.659

00:09:38.518 --> 00:09:40.859
Caption: percent which is you know eight times

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:42.659

Caption: is so fantastic

00:09:42.659 --> 00:09:46.859
Caption: but also we can look at Impressions if

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:50.760
Caption: you look at m s one we just showed the

00:09:46.859 --> 00:09:52.979

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.720
Caption: people saw it all the three tweets

00:09:52.979 --> 00:09:55.979
Caption: but a low engagement rate so really

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:57.059
Caption: depends on marketing do you want people

00:09:55.979 --> 00:09:58.079
Caption: engaging the content or do you want

00:09:57.059 --> 00:09:59.338
Caption: people seeing you so that&#39;s the

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.898
Caption: difference between brand awareness and

00:09:59.338 --> 00:10:02.458
Caption: you&#39;re trying to get them to buy your

00:10:00.898 --> 00:10:04.018
Caption: stuff

00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:06.778

00:10:04.018 --> 00:10:09.419
Caption: you go so TCL is it eight percent and m

00:10:06.778 --> 00:10:11.159
Caption: s was one I just showed

00:10:09.419 --> 00:10:13.079

00:10:28.018 --> 00:10:30.539
Caption: those High numbers of Impressions and

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.179
Caption: the top

00:10:30.539 --> 00:10:35.759
Caption: um 20 down to Agy there which is one of

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:37.859
Caption: the stocks I decided to focus on them

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.119
Caption: so what I decided was is there&#39;s plenty

00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:40.440
Caption: of news stories written about these

00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:42.059
Caption: stocks if you&#39;re on Twitter or LinkedIn

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.679
Caption: or whatever is I&#39;m going to write video

00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:44.700
Caption: content about those news stories so

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:46.260
Caption: basically getting a free ride off

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.579
Caption: someone else&#39;s content

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.320
Caption: so what I did was I thought well I&#39;ll

00:10:47.578 --> 00:10:51.539
Caption: focus on that top 20 because then I can

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.979
Caption: focus you know my spend my effort on

00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:55.320
Caption: those and that&#39;s the only tweets I send

00:10:52.979 --> 00:10:57.659
Caption: out so you really want to keep the um

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.518
Caption: you really want to keep the volume down

00:10:57.659 --> 00:11:00.838
Caption: So based on that sorry let&#39;s keep going

00:10:59.518 --> 00:11:02.159
Caption: through

00:11:00.838 --> 00:11:05.640
Caption: um I started looking at video content

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:09.838
Caption: and now we&#39;ll talk about deep fakes

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:13.320

00:11:09.838 --> 00:11:14.880
Caption: hi I&#39;m Santa Claus&#39;s digital twin the

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.039
Caption: difference between a deep fake and a

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.500
Caption: digital twin is that a digital twin is

00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:22.139
Caption: made with consent of the person whereas

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.820
Caption: a deep fake is done without consent

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.380
Caption: so thank you Santa post for that

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.179
Caption: explanation and that&#39;s the bit I wanted

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.799
Caption: to bring up so deep fakes I think is the

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:30.898
Caption: pejorative or the you know the negative

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:32.760
Caption: term digital twins are done with consent

00:11:30.898 --> 00:11:34.320
Caption: that&#39;s very important in all this this

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.140
Caption: guy&#39;s an actor my kids are in the room

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.700
Caption: this guy&#39;s an actor okay so we have to

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.920
Caption: be respectful towards the actors in this

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.600
Caption: they are paid okay they&#39;re paid to use

00:11:40.919 --> 00:11:44.278
Caption: their likeness so there&#39;s very strict

00:11:42.599 --> 00:11:45.778
Caption: rules or ethics around what you do it

00:11:44.278 --> 00:11:47.278
Caption: can&#39;t be political can&#39;t be religious

00:11:45.778 --> 00:11:48.599
Caption: you know no harassment no bullying this

00:11:47.278 --> 00:11:50.039
Caption: is very important this and a lot of the

00:11:48.599 --> 00:11:51.778
Caption: platforms I assume all the platforms

00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:53.639
Caption: police that there&#39;s a lot of content

00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:54.778
Caption: moderation intentionally because what

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.940
Caption: you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re getting Santa

00:11:54.778 --> 00:11:58.559
Caption: Claus or somebody else to say something

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.419
Caption: and they wouldn&#39;t even know it&#39;s been

00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:01.260
Caption: done so it&#39;s a very important in all

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:03.599
Caption: this and that&#39;s where the difference

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.100
Caption: between a deep fake and digital twin so

00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:07.139
Caption: there&#39;s I think the most commonly ripped

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:08.458
Caption: off guys um Tom Cruise he&#39;s an actor

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.778
Caption: plenty of footage

00:12:08.458 --> 00:12:11.760
Caption: so

00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:13.200
Caption: um yeah most common group stuff but

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.119
Caption: that&#39;s the big difference here is we use

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.380
Caption: digital twins which most people know as

00:12:15.119 --> 00:12:18.659
Caption: deep fakes but that&#39;s that&#39;s a very

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:21.239
Caption: important difference there

00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:22.739
Caption: so what platform&#39;s out there&#39;s plenty of

00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:24.299
