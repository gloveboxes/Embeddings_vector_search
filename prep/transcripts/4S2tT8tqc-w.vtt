Caption: hopefully this afternoon you&#39;re in here

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:10.840
Caption: for a session on accessibility if you

00:00:09.878 --> 00:00:12.399
Caption: wanted something other than

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.930
Caption: accessibility then you&#39;re in the wrong

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.878
Caption: room

Caption: I&#39;ve asked Christy to come and to sign

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.240
Caption: for me today because I think it&#39;s

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.939
Caption: important for a number of reasons I

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.378
Caption: don&#39;t know if anyone here is

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:38.139
Caption: hearing-impaired however there could be

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.390
Caption: as this presentation is being videotaped

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:42.970
Caption: it&#39;s going to be available online and

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:44.559
Caption: we&#39;ve got no idea what the needs are of

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.450
Caption: the users that are going to be watching

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.530
Caption: that so it&#39;s important and that&#39;s

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.120
Caption: something that we&#39;re going to be

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:51.828
Caption: discussing a little bit more about the

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:55.159
Caption: importance of everybody

00:00:51.828 --> 00:00:57.529
Caption: my name is Vivian Conway and I&#39;m the

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.988
Caption: director of web key IT where

00:00:57.529 --> 00:01:02.058
Caption: accessibility consultants and that&#39;s all

00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:04.669
Caption: that we do and believe me that&#39;s a big

00:01:02.058 --> 00:01:07.400
Caption: job on its own I&#39;d prefer that you don&#39;t

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:09.199
Caption: try to take a lot of notes today I&#39;ve

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.840
Caption: intentionally made these slides quite

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:13.430
Caption: text-heavy for a reason because they are

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:15.799
Caption: going to be available there&#39;s a lot of

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.290
Caption: links there&#39;s a lot of information in

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.750
Caption: the slides I&#39;ll be talking to them not

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.239
Caption: reading them but I want you to be able

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.580
Caption: to access this information and to go and

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:26.809
Caption: do some research yourself and just see

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.319
Caption: what you think of the field of

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:29.319
Caption: accessibility

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.020
Caption: why do we label people as having

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:39.679
Caption: disabilities or even worse why do we

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:42.139
Caption: talk about disabled people today I want

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.000
Caption: to challenge your thinking

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:46.728
Caption: I want to complete I want you to

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.699
Caption: completely change the way you think how

00:01:46.728 --> 00:01:52.809
Caption: you view the work you do and the

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:52.809
Caption: services that you&#39;re providing

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.580
Caption: I thought people don&#39;t have disabilities

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:06.260
Caption: every person has a unique set of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.139
Caption: capabilities or abilities it&#39;s us who

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.330
Caption: disabled people by putting obstacles in

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.330
Caption: their path to hold on to that thought

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:20.229
Caption: see here a list of the things that I&#39;m

00:02:16.628 --> 00:02:23.018
Caption: thinking hoping to cover today but most

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:25.869
Caption: importantly my purpose today is to

00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:28.449
Caption: challenge your current thinking I want

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:31.440
Caption: to inspire you to create for inclusivity

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:34.869
Caption: I want you to understand what digital

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.958
Caption: accessibility is all about and I want to

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:40.860
Caption: help good developers become great

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.860
Caption: developers

00:02:41.238 --> 00:02:46.218
Caption: when we look at the reasons why people

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:48.708
Caption: start to address accessibility there&#39;s

00:02:46.218 --> 00:02:50.809
Caption: three main reasons that come up first of

00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:53.779
Caption: all people think well it&#39;s the right

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:55.839
Caption: thing to do it it&#39;s the moral

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:58.669
Caption: high-ground it&#39;s a good thing to do

00:02:55.839 --> 00:03:01.429
Caption: other people think it&#39;s the smart thing

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:04.009
Caption: to do they want to get the extra

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:05.569
Caption: customers into their business or into

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:08.049
Caption: their website that they feel that

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.970
Caption: they&#39;ve been missing up to now

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.889
Caption: some people would say that you could

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.509
Caption: skip the first two of these two reasons

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.339
Caption: the fact that it&#39;s the right thing to do

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.529
Caption: in the smart thing to do but that you

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:20.500
Caption: can&#39;t skip the third one that it&#39;s the

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:22.360
Caption: law I would say that you can actually if

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.639
Caption: you wanted you could skip all three of

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.160
Caption: these but it would be at your company&#39;s

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.559
Caption: peril

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.260
Caption: the disability sector is going through a

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:32.970
Caption: lot of review at the moment and things

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.549
Caption: people with disabilities are becoming

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.320
Caption: more and more aware of their rights of

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.919
Caption: their equal rights to access in for

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.920
Caption: information

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.979
Caption: litigation for violation of

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.000
Caption: accessibility is increasing in Australia

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:51.169
Caption: it is law you can be sued we don&#39;t want

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.330
Caption: you to be and we don&#39;t want to use a

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.949
Caption: stick that&#39;s not the whole idea we would

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.710
Caption: like you to buy into the ideas of

00:03:54.949 --> 00:04:01.699
Caption: accessibility because you want to do it

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.410
Caption: and that&#39;s important in the next section

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:06.020
Caption: we&#39;re going to be looking at is actually

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.730
Caption: what the requirements are and it&#39;s kind

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.529
Caption: of funny because I know that you guys

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.839
Caption: want to know this because when you were

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:13.580
Caption: voting for presentations there was a

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:15.889
Caption: couple of presentations that I proposed

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.269
Caption: and one sounded really really fun it was

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.720
Caption: about accessibility but it was a lot

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.790
Caption: more fun you guys voted to know what the

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.049
Caption: requirements are for you and I think

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.480
Caption: that&#39;s important to notice that

00:04:24.049 --> 00:04:29.589
Caption: developers want to know what you should

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.589
Caption: be doing and how to do it

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:34.649
Caption: in Australia across Australia there&#39;s

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.790
Caption: federal government requirements and it

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:39.329
Caption: came in with something called the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.330
Caption: national transition strategy now each of

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:44.639
Caption: the states bought in to the requirements

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:46.199
Caption: and each of them set up different dates

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.690
Caption: and different levels that they would

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.270
Caption: meet each of the dates the Australian

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.610
Caption: federal government mandated that all of

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:55.199
Caption: their websites were to be compliant to

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:56.369
Caption: what we&#39;ll call WIC egg and I&#39;ll get

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.270
Caption: back to that in a minute

00:04:56.369 --> 00:05:03.049
Caption: by December 2014 can you guess how many

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:03.049
Caption: actually were

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.360
Caption: absolutely zero even the main federal

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:12.480
Caption: governments who were putting forth the

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:15.059
Caption: legislation one thing is for certain not

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.880
Caption: meeting wicked to two level double-a

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:19.799
Caption: will leave you at risk there were some

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.559
Caption: questions in the last session about risk

00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:25.009
Caption: you will be at risk if you do not meet

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.010
Caption: these guidelines

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.520
Caption: the guidelines as I mentioned are the

00:05:28.908 --> 00:05:34.779
Caption: web content accessibility guidelines and

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:38.658
Caption: they&#39;re currently at version 2.0

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:42.158
Caption: now these guidelines are the child of

00:05:38.658 --> 00:05:44.718
Caption: the w3c the World Wide Web Consortium

00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:48.319
Caption: these are the people that make standards

00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:51.109
Caption: your HTML etc is all your accessibility

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:54.139
Caption: guidelines they all come through w3c

00:05:51.109 --> 00:05:56.538
Caption: which is a member organization now an

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.699
Caption: important thing to note is that wicked

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:02.179
Caption: to two level double-a has now become an

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:06.639
Caption: ISO standard so organizations that are

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:09.649
Caption: not familiar with wicked and w3c they do

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:13.360
Caption: understand ISO and that&#39;s the reason why

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:13.359
Caption: it was adopted as an ISO standard

00:06:14.688 --> 00:06:19.338
Caption: many of you provide development work for

00:06:17.178 --> 00:06:21.558
Caption: organizations who spend a lot of time

00:06:19.338 --> 00:06:23.808
Caption: and money making sure their

00:06:21.558 --> 00:06:26.148
Caption: organizations are ISO compliant in other

00:06:23.808 --> 00:06:28.548
Caption: areas for example their policies their

00:06:26.148 --> 00:06:30.948
Caption: procedures there are health and safety

00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:34.389
Caption: their finances they spend a lot of money

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:34.389
Caption: being in compliance with standards

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:43.449
Caption: one thing is for certain that they

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.060
Caption: understand ISIL but they don&#39;t know that

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.850
Caption: there is an ISO standard that applies to

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:52.029
Caption: accessibility that iso standard is

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.640
Caption: wicked - two double-a you don&#39;t have to

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:57.190
Caption: buy that iso standard you can download

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.960
Caption: wicked - and see it with no cost

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:03.850
Caption: whatsoever because iso standards are

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:06.699
Caption: expensive so who and what is covered by

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:09.279
Caption: the guidelines first of all your

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.410
Caption: internet your internet connection that&#39;s

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:13.660
Caption: covered by the guidelines your intranet

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.540
Caption: so internally so it&#39;s not just the

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.790
Caption: external stuff facing to the public

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.710
Caption: it&#39;s what&#39;s facing your staff as well

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.020
Caption: and we&#39;ll be looking at that as to why

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:25.089
Caption: that is in just a minute but that&#39;s

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:28.559
Caption: covered as well also your extra nets any

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:31.029
Caption: supplier connections that you have any

00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:33.549
Caption: documents that you need an internet

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:37.239
Caption: connection to download are covered by

00:07:33.549 --> 00:07:40.179
Caption: this so anything you need an internet

00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:43.569
Caption: connection to get is covered by them

00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:45.399
Caption: including your email so say goodbye to

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:49.119
Caption: the pretty pink signature line that

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:51.190
Caption: you&#39;ve been using not going to work

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:52.720
Caption: so who needs to be compliant is this

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.769
Caption: just for government is this just

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.299
Caption: something that you know federal

00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:57.698
Caption: government have to do this but nobody

00:07:55.299 --> 00:08:01.599
Caption: else no that&#39;s not the case the case is

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:05.559
Caption: every individual and organization that

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.149
Caption: has digital material that has a base in

00:08:05.559 --> 00:08:09.479
Caption: Australia is covered by Australia&#39;s

00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:12.040
Caption: regulations these are international

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:14.559
Caption: regulations there&#39;s almost nowhere in

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.410
Caption: the world that doesn&#39;t require these

00:08:14.559 --> 00:08:19.029
Caption: guidelines to be met so everybody from

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:22.300
Caption: Joe&#39;s garage to the Prime Minister is

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:25.169
Caption: covered by them have you ever used a

00:08:22.299 --> 00:08:28.899
Caption: website that&#39;s really really unfriendly

00:08:25.169 --> 00:08:32.020
Caption: tried to find specific content and you

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:34.900
Caption: couldn&#39;t if you had a physical shop

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.539

Caption: we&#39;ll be coming up with one of those

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:47.849

00:10:45.869 --> 00:10:50.400
Caption: oh I&#39;ll go back to that slide for one

00:10:47.849 --> 00:10:51.838
Caption: second an important thing to note and

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.320
Caption: the reason why I put this particular

00:10:51.838 --> 00:10:57.419
Caption: slide in is notice the comment we see if

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.580
Caption: this works yes here we are this

00:10:57.419 --> 00:11:02.909
Caption: requirement applies to any of individual

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.890
Caption: or organization developing a website so

00:11:02.909 --> 00:11:07.309
Caption: nobody gets to get out of jail free card

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.739
Caption: on this one

00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:14.119
Caption: so as I mentioned they administer the

00:11:09.739 --> 00:11:17.419
Caption: guidelines they they advise you to get

00:11:14.119 --> 00:11:19.489
Caption: expert advice so it&#39;s one of these

00:11:17.419 --> 00:11:21.768
Caption: things that when I talk about

00:11:19.489 --> 00:11:23.838
Caption: accessibility I remind people that if

00:11:21.768 --> 00:11:26.688
Caption: I&#39;m driving down the car driving in my

00:11:23.838 --> 00:11:28.818
Caption: car down the road at 200 kilometres an

00:11:26.689 --> 00:11:31.550
Caption: hour and the policeman pulls me over

00:11:28.818 --> 00:11:34.398
Caption: provided he could catch me and he says

00:11:31.549 --> 00:11:37.008
Caption: why were you driving so fast and if I

00:11:34.398 --> 00:11:39.198
Caption: say well I didn&#39;t know that that was the

00:11:37.008 --> 00:11:41.869
Caption: speed limit do you think he&#39;s going to

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:44.719
Caption: care that I say that no it&#39;s my

00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:47.958
Caption: obligation as the driver of a vehicle to

00:11:44.719 --> 00:11:50.508
Caption: know the laws that apply it&#39;s your

00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:53.479
Caption: obligation if you have a website or are

00:11:50.508 --> 00:11:57.498
Caption: developing a website I know the law same

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:59.448
Caption: thing ignorant is no excuse so make sure

00:11:57.499 --> 00:12:01.999
Caption: that you get help

00:11:59.448 --> 00:12:04.128
Caption: we advise organizations that it&#39;s a good

00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:06.980
Caption: idea to get a baseline audit of a

00:12:04.129 --> 00:12:08.749
Caption: website so that before even if you&#39;re

00:12:06.979 --> 00:12:10.729
Caption: going to redevelop the website or do

00:12:08.749 --> 00:12:13.250
Caption: some changes find out what&#39;s the matter

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:15.528
Caption: with the current one before you start to

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.419
Caption: make changes get that baseline audit

00:12:15.528 --> 00:12:19.758
Caption: done then if you&#39;re going to develop a

00:12:17.419 --> 00:12:22.969
Caption: new website you know what things not to

00:12:19.758 --> 00:12:24.919
Caption: mess up again while you&#39;re about it

00:12:22.969 --> 00:12:28.628
Caption: don&#39;t forget about testing with people

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:31.369
Caption: with disabilities and remember seniors

00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:33.410
Caption: not see not all seniors are going to be

00:12:31.369 --> 00:12:36.219
Caption: comfortable with our websites something

00:12:33.409 --> 00:12:38.589
Caption: that you&#39;ve got a plan for

00:12:36.219 --> 00:12:40.419
Caption: policy is changing people with

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.210

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:46.300

00:12:51.849 --> 00:12:55.899
Caption: with a digital resource you need to tell

00:12:54.219 --> 00:12:58.359
Caption: the owner of that resource that it

00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:01.210
Caption: doesn&#39;t work for you give them the

00:12:58.359 --> 00:13:03.130

Caption: to fix it after all it&#39;s too late then

00:13:13.239 --> 00:13:17.890

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.409

Caption: develop new digital materials to meet

00:14:24.909 --> 00:14:31.479

00:14:28.239 --> 00:14:33.959
Caption: do it do you know what the requirements

00:14:31.479 --> 00:14:33.959
Caption: are

00:14:34.338 --> 00:14:39.679
Caption: governments have now just done as of

00:14:36.828 --> 00:14:42.679
Caption: January 1st we have now introduced an

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:44.438
Caption: Australian standard up to now we&#39;ve had

00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:47.659
Caption: to rely on Australian Human Rights

00:14:44.439 --> 00:14:49.550
Caption: administering the the DDA but we now

00:14:47.659 --> 00:14:51.948
Caption: have something that we can kind of short

00:14:49.549 --> 00:14:52.609
Caption: circuit court circuit that legal process

00:14:51.948 --> 00:14:55.338
Caption: a little bit

00:14:52.609 --> 00:14:57.588
Caption: it&#39;s called Australian standard a s 301

00:14:55.338 --> 00:15:00.469
Caption: 549 then you can tell I&#39;ve got that one

00:14:57.588 --> 00:15:03.018
Caption: memorized I&#39;ve said it so many times now

00:15:00.469 --> 00:15:07.638
Caption: what that means is it&#39;s the European

00:15:03.018 --> 00:15:10.188
Caption: standard of 301 549 so en 301 549 we&#39;ve

00:15:07.638 --> 00:15:10.729
Caption: adopted it as Australia lock stock and

00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:12.110
Caption: barrel

00:15:10.729 --> 00:15:13.398
Caption: we&#39;ve got the whole thing we&#39;ve brought

00:15:12.109 --> 00:15:15.859
Caption: it in and we&#39;re going to make any

00:15:13.398 --> 00:15:17.419
Caption: changes we need over time rather than to

00:15:15.859 --> 00:15:19.128
Caption: take four years with a government

00:15:17.419 --> 00:15:19.758
Caption: bureaucracy Department to write a new

00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:21.529
Caption: standard

00:15:19.758 --> 00:15:24.648
Caption: so we&#39;ve adopted the European one

00:15:21.528 --> 00:15:28.068
Caption: because it works and so what will happen

00:15:24.648 --> 00:15:30.198
Caption: is that organizations can embed this

00:15:28.068 --> 00:15:32.869
Caption: Australian standard in their tendering

00:15:30.198 --> 00:15:34.909
Caption: documents so if you&#39;re going to respond

00:15:32.869 --> 00:15:38.929
Caption: to a tender to develop some digital

00:15:34.909 --> 00:15:41.659
Caption: materials you will now start seeing must

00:15:38.929 --> 00:15:46.219
Caption: provide compliance statement with a s

00:15:41.659 --> 00:15:49.188
Caption: 301 549 that is wicked to two level

00:15:46.219 --> 00:15:50.328
Caption: chale keep hearing that same thing don&#39;t

00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:52.459
Caption: you they&#39;re putting it everywhere so

00:15:50.328 --> 00:15:56.299
Caption: that it gets through that is the

00:15:52.458 --> 00:15:58.068
Caption: standard that you must meet so it&#39;s not

00:15:56.299 --> 00:16:01.518
Caption: just government&#39;s though that can use it

00:15:58.068 --> 00:16:04.458
Caption: if anybody even as an individual or as a

00:16:01.518 --> 00:16:06.828
Caption: company wants to make sure that what

00:16:04.458 --> 00:16:09.198
Caption: they pay for is accessible they can

00:16:06.828 --> 00:16:12.018
Caption: embed that statement into their

00:16:09.198 --> 00:16:14.179
Caption: tendering documents and say that we will

00:16:12.018 --> 00:16:15.289
Caption: require a statement of compliance so

00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:17.628
Caption: that means you&#39;re gonna have to have

00:16:15.289 --> 00:16:20.328
Caption: some examples aren&#39;t you to prove that

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:22.879
Caption: you can do accessible work you will not

00:16:20.328 --> 00:16:26.058
Caption: get federal government work they are not

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:28.250

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:36.860

00:16:35.088 --> 00:16:39.438
Caption: start reading on this and find out about

00:16:36.859 --> 00:16:41.448
Caption: it state governments are putting that in

00:16:39.439 --> 00:16:43.040

00:16:43.039 --> 00:16:47.388

00:16:45.229 --> 00:16:50.179

00:16:47.388 --> 00:16:52.578

00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:55.549
Caption: account that what you&#39;re giving them is

00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:57.549

00:16:55.549 --> 00:16:59.619

00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:04.790

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:10.578

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:21.380

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.630
Caption: told you that your website&#39;s not

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:26.150
Caption: accessible it&#39;s kind of bad for an

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:29.530
Caption: accessibility organization well we just

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:32.119
Caption: paid a fortune to have this website done

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.919
Caption: there was no legal recourse for them

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:35.959
Caption: they had put in there that they wanted

00:17:33.918 --> 00:17:38.869

00:17:38.869 --> 00:17:43.699

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:47.080

00:17:43.699 --> 00:17:48.789
Caption: borne the extra cost of having it fixed

00:17:47.079 --> 00:17:51.069

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:55.719

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.070
Caption: make sure that you understand what those

00:17:55.719 --> 00:18:00.949
Caption: guidelines are

00:17:58.069 --> 00:18:03.469
Caption: time to change our thinking but it&#39;s not

00:18:00.949 --> 00:18:06.559
Caption: going to be easy so I&#39;m gonna be looking

00:18:03.469 --> 00:18:10.219
Caption: here a little bit of data for you on the

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:12.560
Caption: 2011 census not the one just recently

00:18:10.219 --> 00:18:15.919
Caption: that we messed up so badly the previous

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:18.140
Caption: one 20% of the population registered as

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.900
Caption: having a disability that in some way

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:24.650
Caption: affected their education their mobility

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:26.300
Caption: or their employment that&#39;s 20% that&#39;s it

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:29.410
Caption: was almost 20% that&#39;s one in five

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:33.910
Caption: however that&#39;s the tip of the iceberg

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:35.840
Caption: because if I&#39;m slightly dyslexic I

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:40.070
Caption: probably wouldn&#39;t have said I had a

00:18:35.839 --> 00:18:41.689
Caption: disability if I have epilepsy but

00:18:40.069 --> 00:18:43.609
Caption: because of the social stigma that&#39;s

00:18:41.689 --> 00:18:45.379
Caption: attached to it I didn&#39;t want to put that

00:18:43.609 --> 00:18:47.630
Caption: down I&#39;m not in there I mean after all

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.819
Caption: and ten years since I had a seizure I

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.859
Caption: wouldn&#39;t consider that however if your

00:18:49.819 --> 00:18:55.699
Caption: websites flashing at me it might provoke

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:58.579
Caption: one but consider the people who have

00:18:55.699 --> 00:19:01.010
Caption: multiple low-level disabilities so say

00:18:58.579 --> 00:19:04.099
Caption: I&#39;m getting a little bit older English

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:06.109
Caption: is my second language and I&#39;ve got a bit

00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:09.010
Caption: of a shape to my hand so I find small

00:19:06.109 --> 00:19:12.829
Caption: links hard to use I&#39;m not in that data

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:17.329
Caption: if I simply am not comfortable using a

00:19:12.829 --> 00:19:19.789
Caption: mouse I hand stuff but in that data if

00:19:17.329 --> 00:19:22.219
Caption: as I said numerous things of my

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.660
Caption: eyesight&#39;s not so great or certain

00:19:22.219 --> 00:19:25.579
Caption: things I find difficulty with

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.830
Caption: concentrating or I&#39;m just you know a

00:19:25.579 --> 00:19:30.919
Caption: little bit dyslexic I often think I am

00:19:27.829 --> 00:19:35.510
Caption: I&#39;m not in that at all it&#39;s actually

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:37.850
Caption: closer to 50% of the population require

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:41.750
Caption: some accessibility considerations in a

00:19:37.849 --> 00:19:45.869
Caption: website can you afford to disregard

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:47.729
Caption: almost half of your users probably not

00:19:45.869 --> 00:19:49.680
Caption: the other thing to keep in mind as well

00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:52.859
Caption: is that when you look at two websites

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:57.030
Caption: very very similar in appearance one will

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:59.819
Caption: be accessible and one won&#39;t 100 percent

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:03.580
Caption: of people if asked we&#39;ll choose the

00:19:59.819 --> 00:20:09.638
Caption: accessible version why

00:20:03.579 --> 00:20:11.528
Caption: simple design elegant things work

00:20:09.639 --> 00:20:13.208
Caption: to have buttons but if they don&#39;t tell

00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:14.799
Caption: you what they are when you&#39;re tabbing

00:20:13.208 --> 00:20:17.259
Caption: through it what good is it

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:20.618
Caption: I&#39;ve tab through many forums and it says

00:20:17.259 --> 00:20:22.749
Caption: edit blank wonderful what do I put in

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:24.879
Caption: there it hasn&#39;t told me if you can&#39;t see

00:20:22.749 --> 00:20:26.950
Caption: the word name you don&#39;t know that that&#39;s

00:20:24.879 --> 00:20:29.078
Caption: a label if you haven&#39;t coded it properly

00:20:26.949 --> 00:20:30.788
Caption: which will bring us to something about

00:20:29.078 --> 00:20:33.328
Caption: best practice coding that we&#39;ll look at

00:20:30.788 --> 00:20:33.328
Caption: in just a minute

00:20:34.119 --> 00:20:39.579
Caption: there&#39;s a famous quote the power of the

00:20:36.459 --> 00:20:42.219
Caption: web is in its universality accessed by

00:20:39.579 --> 00:20:45.819
Caption: everybody regardless of disability is an

00:20:42.219 --> 00:20:49.569
Caption: essential aspect it&#39;s a very very famous

00:20:45.819 --> 00:20:51.909
Caption: quote by Sir Tim berners-lee please note

00:20:49.569 --> 00:20:54.130
Caption: both who said it and the fact that it

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:57.880
Caption: brings our focus to one of the most

00:20:54.130 --> 00:21:01.839
Caption: important aspects of the web access by

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:04.150
Caption: everyone is an essential component part

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:06.429
Caption: of why it was developed so if you&#39;re not

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:10.410
Caption: trying to design for everybody you&#39;re

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:10.410
Caption: missing one of the important aspects

00:21:10.428 --> 00:21:17.089
Caption: I love this picture our good intentions

00:21:12.769 --> 00:21:19.129
Caption: good enough in the physical sense we can

00:21:17.089 --> 00:21:22.099
Caption: see how ridiculous this wheelchair ramp

00:21:19.129 --> 00:21:24.799
Caption: is the assumption is made obviously that

00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:26.388
Caption: people with wheelchairs have somebody

00:21:24.798 --> 00:21:27.918
Caption: that can help them over the lip but I

00:21:26.389 --> 00:21:30.590
Caption: mean why do it in the first place it&#39;s

00:21:27.918 --> 00:21:32.868
Caption: completely stupid have you ever seen

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:36.048
Caption: wheelchair basketball players do you

00:21:32.869 --> 00:21:37.789
Caption: think one of them wants you to help them

00:21:36.048 --> 00:21:40.849
Caption: over the lip of the wheelchair around if

00:21:37.788 --> 00:21:44.359
Caption: you do a search in your favorite search

00:21:40.849 --> 00:21:46.548
Caption: engine and look at failed wheelchair

00:21:44.359 --> 00:21:48.589
Caption: ramps you will see some of the most

00:21:46.548 --> 00:21:51.349
Caption: ridiculous pictures you&#39;ve ever seen

00:21:48.589 --> 00:21:52.969
Caption: anywhere slopes that just make you go

00:21:51.349 --> 00:21:54.969
Caption: dizzy at the thought of even trying to

00:21:52.969 --> 00:21:58.788
Caption: get down them let alone in a wheelchair

00:21:54.969 --> 00:22:01.449
Caption: so thinking about the relationship to

00:21:58.788 --> 00:22:03.819
Caption: the physical and the digital our

00:22:01.449 --> 00:22:09.408
Caption: assumptions for digital accessibility

00:22:03.819 --> 00:22:11.898
Caption: based on laziness ignorance or what why

00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:14.570
Caption: aren&#39;t we meeting the accessibility

00:22:11.899 --> 00:22:17.720
Caption: guidelines why aren&#39;t we designing

00:22:14.569 --> 00:22:19.839
Caption: excessively there&#39;s a problem isn&#39;t

00:22:17.719 --> 00:22:19.839
Caption: there

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:25.780
Caption: so who does accessibility actually

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:27.700
Caption: benefit as I mentioned everybody really

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.979
Caption: benefits from a more accessible website

00:22:27.699 --> 00:22:32.319
Caption: but besides people with disabilities

00:22:29.979 --> 00:22:35.140
Caption: there&#39;s older users people with mobile

00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:37.469
Caption: phones you ever tried to fill out a PDF

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.369
Caption: document on your phone on the train

00:22:37.469 --> 00:22:40.559
Caption: forget it it&#39;s not going to work very

00:22:39.369 --> 00:22:42.849
Caption: well is it

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.370
Caption: people living in areas with lower

00:22:42.849 --> 00:22:47.739
Caption: bandwidth so if there&#39;s a document that

00:22:45.369 --> 00:22:49.510
Caption: they need to download and it hasn&#39;t told

00:22:47.739 --> 00:22:51.459
Caption: them how big it is and how long it&#39;s

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.530
Caption: going to take they might prefer to

00:22:51.459 --> 00:22:55.719
Caption: download that later on after they&#39;re

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:58.660
Caption: finished rather than to hang everything

00:22:55.719 --> 00:23:00.579
Caption: up waiting for it now a simple matter in

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:04.729
Caption: the link of saying how big the document

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:07.519
Caption: is not rocket science

00:23:04.729 --> 00:23:10.189
Caption: in some areas approximately twelve and a

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.300
Caption: half percent of the population are over

00:23:10.189 --> 00:23:13.549
Caption: the age of 60

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:16.880
Caption: based on this previous census data again

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:18.680
Caption: and eighteen percent of the residents in

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.660
Caption: one of the local communities that I was

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.780
Caption: working with come from countries where

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:25.430
Caption: English is not their first language and

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.469
Caption: you say okay well you know English is

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:29.360
Caption: our first language you know do we need

00:23:27.469 --> 00:23:30.819
Caption: to do that do we care about our users

00:23:29.359 --> 00:23:33.799
Caption: yes we do

00:23:30.819 --> 00:23:38.000
Caption: did you know that if you use the

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:39.710
Caption: abbreviation pH space and O for a phone

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.560
Caption: number which is really really common

00:23:39.709 --> 00:23:43.329
Caption: it&#39;s pronounced for a screen reader as a

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.920
Caption: No

00:23:43.329 --> 00:23:47.269
Caption: now if you have English as a second

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.250
Caption: language and you&#39;re listening on a

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.459
Caption: screen reader would you know what it

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.939
Caption: wanted when it asked for your for no

00:23:51.459 --> 00:23:55.809
Caption: probably not

00:23:52.939 --> 00:23:55.809
Caption: I&#39;d have trouble with that

00:23:55.969 --> 00:24:00.469
Caption: how does business benefit from

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:03.410
Caption: accessibility first of all you can boost

00:24:00.469 --> 00:24:05.989
Caption: your user base by that at least 20% that

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:08.630
Caption: I mentioned the work that you do on

00:24:05.989 --> 00:24:11.839
Caption: incorporating accessibility should more

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:13.790
Caption: than pay for itself we&#39;re not asking you

00:24:11.839 --> 00:24:15.439
Caption: to spend a lot of money or an

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:17.690
Caption: organization to spend a lot of money

00:24:15.439 --> 00:24:20.239
Caption: that there isn&#39;t a decent return on

00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:23.029
Caption: investment or people who embrace

00:24:20.239 --> 00:24:24.949
Caption: accessibility seldom embrace it for the

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:26.960
Caption: return on the investment normally

00:24:24.949 --> 00:24:30.289
Caption: they&#39;re wanting to do the right thing

00:24:26.959 --> 00:24:32.270
Caption: but it&#39;s important to know because their

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:34.550
Caption: shareholders as well that there is a

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:37.820
Caption: return on investment and if you spend

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:39.710
Caption: this money on designing excessively more

00:24:37.819 --> 00:24:42.829
Caption: people are actually going to use your

00:24:39.709 --> 00:24:45.890
Caption: website existing users are likely to be

00:24:42.829 --> 00:24:48.409
Caption: a whole lot more loyal it&#39;s wonderful

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:51.290
Caption: public relations there is nothing the

Caption: know who&#39;s invested the money in

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.500

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:17.390
Caption: social responsibility terms this is an

00:25:15.349 --> 00:25:20.660

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:23.290
Caption: you care about all your users really

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.290

00:25:26.739 --> 00:25:32.859

00:25:29.918 --> 00:25:35.558

Caption: most common questions people ask I want

00:25:38.109 --> 00:25:42.879
Caption: to come up higher in the list how can I

00:25:39.968 --> 00:25:45.609
Caption: do that incorporating accessibility

00:25:42.879 --> 00:25:48.759
Caption: principles into your design will boost

00:25:45.609 --> 00:25:50.999
Caption: your search engine optimization so think

00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:55.419
Caption: about things like heading structure

00:25:55.418 --> 00:25:59.708
Caption: will all improve your search engine

00:25:57.298 --> 00:26:02.138
Caption: optimization you can also embed

00:25:59.708 --> 00:26:05.468
Caption: information in the metadata that

00:26:02.139 --> 00:26:07.650

00:26:10.538 --> 00:26:15.038

Caption: Australia spend huge amounts of money on

00:26:15.038 --> 00:26:19.478

00:26:19.479 --> 00:26:24.519

00:26:29.229 --> 00:26:33.759

00:26:31.838 --> 00:26:35.889

00:26:35.889 --> 00:26:41.320
Caption: toilets for people that need disability

00:26:38.619 --> 00:26:44.739
Caption: assistance you would never be allowed to

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:46.658
Caption: open the doors would you yet most of our

00:26:44.739 --> 00:26:49.419
Caption: business is coming through our digital

00:26:46.659 --> 00:26:52.290
Caption: shop fronts and we&#39;re not making sure

00:26:49.418 --> 00:26:55.229
Caption: that people can get through the door

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:57.720
Caption: start to think about the digital

00:26:55.229 --> 00:27:00.989
Caption: accessibility as the digital equivalent

00:26:57.719 --> 00:27:03.270
Caption: of a wheelchair ramp you all understand

00:27:00.989 --> 00:27:05.309
Caption: the need for a wheelchair ramp to start

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:08.270
Caption: to grasp the importance of digital

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.270
Caption: accessibility

00:27:09.209 --> 00:27:13.500
Caption: are you understanding yet that there are

00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:17.580
Caption: lots of benefits in designing

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:20.089
Caption: excessively there&#39;s tons the benefits

00:27:17.579 --> 00:27:23.548
Caption: are both to you and to the website owner

00:27:20.089 --> 00:27:27.089
Caption: if you know how to develop excessively

00:27:23.548 --> 00:27:29.939
Caption: and you&#39;ve got proof that you can you&#39;re

00:27:27.089 --> 00:27:32.520
Caption: a whole lot more marketable than the

00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:34.500
Caption: person who hasn&#39;t done anything person

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.239
Caption: who hasn&#39;t done anything is not going to

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.390
Caption: be able to work on government projects

00:27:36.239 --> 00:27:41.308
Caption: we recently did a project for a local

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:43.558
Caption: government group and they asked us to be

00:27:41.308 --> 00:27:45.689
Caption: on our tender on their tender panel to

00:27:43.558 --> 00:27:47.729
Caption: help them select the successful tenderer

00:27:45.689 --> 00:27:50.879
Caption: because accessibility was a key

00:27:47.729 --> 00:27:52.678
Caption: component they wanted and so when it got

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.779
Caption: down to the final three they said okay

00:27:52.678 --> 00:27:57.178
Caption: Vivian you&#39;re going to ask the difficult

00:27:54.779 --> 00:27:58.770
Caption: questions because we want them to get

00:27:57.178 --> 00:28:01.829
Caption: mad at you not us because we have to

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:04.440
Caption: work with them so they were all asked

00:28:01.829 --> 00:28:07.229
Caption: for three examples of websites that they

00:28:04.439 --> 00:28:10.589
Caption: had created that met wicked to to level

00:28:07.229 --> 00:28:13.408
Caption: delay so the organization gave me the

00:28:10.589 --> 00:28:15.689
Caption: three examples you know not one of them

00:28:13.409 --> 00:28:19.350
Caption: even got to single a and not by a

00:28:15.689 --> 00:28:22.139
Caption: country mile so how could they say they

00:28:19.349 --> 00:28:24.719
Caption: were accessible when they weren&#39;t they

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:27.178
Caption: just thought well we do good work it

00:28:24.719 --> 00:28:28.619
Caption: must be that&#39;s all I can think of is

00:28:27.178 --> 00:28:31.048
Caption: that they actually thought they were

00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:34.319
Caption: rather than telling complete lies and

00:28:31.048 --> 00:28:37.229
Caption: then just for fun I decided to look at

00:28:34.319 --> 00:28:39.778
Caption: the company&#39;s own websites as well they

00:28:37.229 --> 00:28:42.148
Caption: were even worse there was no

00:28:39.779 --> 00:28:45.510
Caption: accessibility provision in there yet

00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:47.580
Caption: they were planning to tender for work

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:49.709
Caption: that was accessible we ended up choosing

00:28:47.579 --> 00:28:51.928
Caption: an organization that looked like it

00:28:49.709 --> 00:28:54.479
Caption: would be the best to work with that

00:28:51.928 --> 00:28:57.298
Caption: would take on board what we said that

00:28:54.479 --> 00:29:00.479
Caption: would learn and grow and be able to

00:28:57.298 --> 00:29:02.599
Caption: produce accessible work but we&#39;re

00:29:00.479 --> 00:29:04.890
Caption: talking about person we could not find

00:29:02.599 --> 00:29:08.158
Caption: developers that could do what needed to

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:10.799
Caption: be done and I&#39;d say that&#39;s a problem to

00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:13.830
Caption: make yourself more marketable show that

00:29:10.798 --> 00:29:17.178
Caption: you can have examples for your clients

00:29:13.829 --> 00:29:17.178
Caption: that are accessible

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.229
Caption: so what actually happens if you decide

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:24.690
Caption: to do nothing first of all you better

00:29:22.229 --> 00:29:27.299
Caption: understand the risks you&#39;ve got the loss

00:29:24.689 --> 00:29:29.969
Caption: of website traffic to your website risk

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:32.910
Caption: of litigation the loss of respect of

00:29:29.969 --> 00:29:34.890
Caption: your customers users will go to a

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:37.650
Caption: company that has a more accessible

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:40.109
Caption: website so if you think of banking now

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:42.300
Caption: everybody who&#39;s working receiving a

00:29:40.109 --> 00:29:44.130
Caption: pension or anything else needs to have a

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:46.280
Caption: bank account now don&#39;t think nobody gets

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:49.739
Caption: a cash pay packet at the end of the week

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:52.950
Caption: so people with disabilities this minimum

00:29:49.739 --> 00:29:56.130
Caption: 20% of the population will open the bank

00:29:52.949 --> 00:29:57.979
Caption: account with the website that works best

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:59.269
Caption: for them

00:29:57.979 --> 00:30:01.130
Caption: that&#39;s how they&#39;re going to choose

00:29:59.269 --> 00:30:04.580
Caption: whether or not they get a quarter of a

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:06.760
Caption: percent more or less is not going to be

00:30:04.579 --> 00:30:09.079
Caption: the deciding point on their decision

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:12.579
Caption: because what good is that for two

00:30:09.079 --> 00:30:15.439
Caption: percent if they can&#39;t use the website

00:30:12.579 --> 00:30:17.239
Caption: we&#39;ve probably all seen Bank websites

00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:20.000
Caption: where in order to log in they&#39;ve got one

00:30:17.239 --> 00:30:21.678
Caption: of those rotating keypads that every

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.308
Caption: time you go to it the keys are in a

00:30:21.678 --> 00:30:28.189
Caption: different position now I tried to test

00:30:25.308 --> 00:30:30.048
Caption: one of those with a screen reader and I

00:30:28.189 --> 00:30:32.808
Caption: wanted to throw my computer out the

00:30:30.048 --> 00:30:35.418
Caption: window because I could go to the first

00:30:32.808 --> 00:30:37.908
Caption: button and I could click it from my

00:30:35.418 --> 00:30:40.158
Caption: first number but it wouldn&#39;t let me put

00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:41.480
Caption: in my second number because I had

00:30:40.159 --> 00:30:44.360
Caption: clicked something and I had to press

00:30:41.479 --> 00:30:46.130
Caption: submit but if I press submit I haven&#39;t

00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:48.678
Caption: put in the other three numbers I needed

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:50.750
Caption: and I had this vicious circle going

00:30:48.678 --> 00:30:53.329
Caption: around my computer came about close to

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:55.069
Caption: going through the window and but the

00:30:53.329 --> 00:30:57.709
Caption: funny thing is is when I called the bank

00:30:55.069 --> 00:30:59.689
Caption: to complain about that what they the

00:30:57.709 --> 00:31:01.278
Caption: person who answered the help was said

00:30:59.689 --> 00:31:04.699
Caption: well actually I&#39;m a person with a

00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:07.580
Caption: disability I&#39;m in a wheelchair but he

00:31:04.699 --> 00:31:10.308
Caption: hadn&#39;t thought that he had a physical

00:31:07.579 --> 00:31:12.859
Caption: disability but his thinking hadn&#39;t gone

00:31:10.308 --> 00:31:15.469
Caption: beyond that to people with different

00:31:12.859 --> 00:31:17.869
Caption: disabilities it&#39;s important to check

00:31:15.469 --> 00:31:20.839
Caption: things not just technical compliance

00:31:17.869 --> 00:31:23.269
Caption: checklists it&#39;s important to test things

00:31:20.839 --> 00:31:25.038
Caption: with people with disabilities that

00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:28.450
Caption: you&#39;ve got a good well-rounded view

00:31:25.038 --> 00:31:30.039
Caption: about how accessible your product is

00:31:28.449 --> 00:31:32.439
Caption: I&#39;m going to show you a few examples

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:35.200
Caption: coming up and hopefully you&#39;ll start to

00:31:32.439 --> 00:31:38.439
Caption: get a bit more of an idea don&#39;t you love

00:31:35.199 --> 00:31:39.969
Caption: this wheelchair wrap one of the best

00:31:38.439 --> 00:31:41.829
Caption: I&#39;ve seen you know really are you

00:31:39.969 --> 00:31:43.479
Caption: kidding me can you just hear everybody

00:31:41.829 --> 00:31:45.159
Caption: sitting you know the lawyers for the two

00:31:43.479 --> 00:31:47.919
Caption: sides you know the property owner and

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.739
Caption: and the person who&#39;s just headed into

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.160
Caption: the creek they&#39;re slogging it out in

00:31:50.739 --> 00:31:53.559
Caption: court

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.359
Caption: this is ridiculous isn&#39;t it the only

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.890
Caption: people who would have fun with it is

00:31:55.359 --> 00:31:59.559
Caption: somebody who might be into wheelchair

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:02.489
Caption: extreme sports um and even then I&#39;d be

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.490
Caption: wondering about them

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:11.880
Caption: here&#39;s another one it&#39;s not just the

00:32:09.449 --> 00:32:14.279
Caption: steps the ridiculously steep slopes of

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:18.930
Caption: the ramps the crazy thing here is that

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:21.960
Caption: the sign is in the middle of the ramp if

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:23.730
Caption: I need a wheelchair ramp do you think I

00:32:21.959 --> 00:32:25.829
Caption: can get out of my chair to move the sign

00:32:23.729 --> 00:32:28.949
Caption: probably not so what were they thinking

00:32:25.829 --> 00:32:30.449
Caption: I approach the building having been told

00:32:28.949 --> 00:32:34.169
Caption: that you know there&#39;s a wheelchair ramp

00:32:30.449 --> 00:32:36.929
Caption: but I can&#39;t use it you think you&#39;ve done

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:41.880
Caption: the right thing in the design of your

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:44.040
Caption: product can people use it have you

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:46.530
Caption: tested it this to us

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.369
Caption: makes perfect sense that it&#39;s absolutely

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.310
Caption: ridiculous

00:32:47.369 --> 00:32:53.339
Caption: the person with the wheelchair

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:57.240
Caption: approaching that business can&#39;t get in

00:32:53.339 --> 00:33:01.739
Caption: so how difficult would it have been to

00:32:57.239 --> 00:33:04.859
Caption: say right the sign on the ramp put a

00:33:01.739 --> 00:33:07.050
Caption: sign off to the side somewhere that it&#39;s

00:33:04.859 --> 00:33:10.290
Caption: for wheelchair access but the reality is

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:12.869
Caption: is if you saw a ramp wouldn&#39;t you know

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:15.060
Caption: it was for wheelchairs not saying

00:33:12.869 --> 00:33:17.829
Caption: somebody else can&#39;t use it but that&#39;s

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:20.470
Caption: just completely ridiculous isn&#39;t it

00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:24.028
Caption: a lot of the things that we do in our

00:33:20.469 --> 00:33:27.788
Caption: website design are just as ridiculous

00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:30.159
Caption: what good is having a button to submit a

00:33:27.788 --> 00:33:33.069
Caption: form if it doesn&#39;t tell you what the

00:33:30.159 --> 00:33:36.909
Caption: button is for the screen reader user

00:33:33.069 --> 00:33:37.569
Caption: will hear button brilliant what do I do

00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:39.850
Caption: with it

00:33:37.569 --> 00:33:41.168
Caption: is it submit is it go back is it go what

00:33:39.849 --> 00:33:44.619
Caption: if there&#39;s three buttons and they all

00:33:41.168 --> 00:33:46.148
Caption: say button button button I&#39;m not going

00:33:44.619 --> 00:33:48.290
Caption: to do anything I&#39;m going to leave your

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:50.300
Caption: website

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:51.859
Caption: I&#39;m going to look at a few examples with

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:55.070
Caption: the permission of Disability Services

00:33:51.859 --> 00:33:56.959
Caption: Commission this is some work they did on

00:33:55.069 --> 00:33:59.539
Caption: one of their websites a few years ago

00:33:56.959 --> 00:34:01.039
Caption: there&#39;s some really important principles

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:04.609
Caption: there&#39;s about six principles here that

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.850
Caption: I&#39;d like you to watch as IDEO you&#39;ll be

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:10.070
Caption: able to have access to all of this later

00:34:06.849 --> 00:34:11.869
Caption: they worked really hard on making sure

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:15.260
Caption: that they had some good design

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:17.510
Caption: principles in here first thing is is

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:21.439
Caption: that they&#39;ve got a skip link go to main

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:23.270
Caption: content up there at number one now it is

00:34:21.439 --> 00:34:27.319
Caption: a requirement that you either have a

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:30.380
Caption: good heading structure or a skip link or

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:32.510
Caption: some way to bypass repeated navigational

00:34:30.379 --> 00:34:35.629
Caption: elements I was looking at a website

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:38.540
Caption: yesterday in order to get to the main

00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:45.979
Caption: content I would have had to hit my tab

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:48.439
Caption: key 147 times the sad thing is is that

00:34:45.979 --> 00:34:51.918
Caption: even if I had passed a skip link that

00:34:48.439 --> 00:34:53.149
Caption: was there once I I think oh well here

00:34:51.918 --> 00:34:55.520
Caption: it&#39;s probably just a couple of tabs

00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:57.260
Caption: because you just see the top level but

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.840
Caption: it actually made me go through every

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:02.479
Caption: single sublevel escaped wouldn&#39;t work no

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.550
Caption: key would work to get out of it I either

00:35:02.479 --> 00:35:07.280
Caption: had to close the website in which case

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:08.870
Caption: I&#39;m unlikely to come back or I had to

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.520
Caption: tap the all the way through you should

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:12.920
Caption: at least be able to get out of it

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.510
Caption: shouldn&#39;t you escape key being action

00:35:12.919 --> 00:35:17.089
Caption: for that would have done the trick but

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:19.639
Caption: it made me go all the way through so if

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:22.250
Caption: you have a skip link that is visible up

00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:24.769
Caption: at the top all the time the user can

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:29.280
Caption: just go ctrl home I can use a skip link

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:31.560
Caption: to get past all of this easy done

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.479
Caption: next one clear focus at number two

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:36.540
Caption: you&#39;ll notice that where the keyboard

00:35:33.479 --> 00:35:38.760
Caption: focus is and the most focus which should

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:42.120
Caption: be the same they have changed the

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:45.300
Caption: background so even if I&#39;m colorblind or

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:49.340
Caption: I have low vision that&#39;s really easy to

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.340
Caption: see the focus indicator of isn&#39;t it

00:35:49.909 --> 00:35:54.889
Caption: on this particular website down at the

00:35:52.429 --> 00:35:57.439
Caption: bottom here there&#39;s support for a whole

00:35:54.889 --> 00:35:59.389
Caption: bunch of different languages now as

00:35:57.439 --> 00:36:01.040
Caption: developers what you&#39;re going to need to

00:35:59.389 --> 00:36:03.859
Caption: do if you want if you&#39;re asked to put

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:06.679
Caption: something like this in is make sure that

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:08.900
Caption: you&#39;re using your HTML language element

00:36:06.679 --> 00:36:10.879
Caption: so identify the language for each

00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:13.879
Caption: section there&#39;s nothing worse than

00:36:10.879 --> 00:36:16.489
Caption: hearing a Vietnamese person&#39;s

00:36:13.879 --> 00:36:18.799

00:36:16.489 --> 00:36:21.260
Caption: Italian or something else it comes out

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.600
Caption: really really weird so the screen reader

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:27.469
Caption: needs to be told what language the

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:30.130

00:36:27.469 --> 00:36:32.359

00:36:30.129 --> 00:36:35.299
Caption: Google Translate itself is not

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.190
Caption: accessible so if you&#39;re putting in

Caption: widgets of things that are third-party

00:36:37.189 --> 00:36:43.219
Caption: products that are not accessible be

Caption: aware that you will be held liable and

00:36:43.219 --> 00:36:47.869
Caption: it will happen in Australia very quickly

00:36:45.919 --> 00:36:50.510
Caption: as soon as somebody decides to test it

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:53.090
Caption: or all third party content on your

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:55.310
Caption: website it&#39;s not a get-out-of-jail-free

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:56.930
Caption: card a lot of developers think it&#39;s

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:59.360
Caption: third party I can&#39;t fix it therefore I&#39;m

00:36:56.929 --> 00:37:01.909
Caption: not responsible if you host it on your

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:04.550

Caption: in their standard form they have to be

00:37:15.709 --> 00:37:23.500
Caption: fixed so they were held liable for that

00:37:20.709 --> 00:37:26.108
Caption: the next item is event warnings now

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:28.839

00:37:41.879 --> 00:37:46.218

Caption: user contacted them asked them to fix it

00:38:14.939 --> 00:38:20.369
Caption: they decided to ignore the user

00:38:17.129 --> 00:38:22.169

00:38:40.139 --> 00:38:45.209
Caption: made accessible and never to do that

00:38:41.909 --> 00:38:48.669

00:38:45.209 --> 00:38:50.679
Caption: it&#39;s not an either-or

00:38:48.669 --> 00:38:52.959
Caption: how much effort are you going to put

00:38:50.679 --> 00:38:54.939
Caption: into making what you develop accessible

00:38:52.959 --> 00:38:56.618
Caption: are you starting to see that it&#39;s

00:38:54.939 --> 00:38:59.260
Caption: actually worth the effort that you put

00:38:56.618 --> 00:39:01.149
Caption: in think about things like keyboard

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.219

00:39:12.959 --> 00:39:18.530
Caption: link&#39;s need to make sense in context and

00:39:16.379 --> 00:39:22.019
Caption: out of context in this particular

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:23.640
Caption: example if you asked for a list of links

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:27.899
Caption: which is what you would get there on the

00:39:23.639 --> 00:39:29.848
Caption: left and you heard IMG one you think

00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:30.808
Caption: you&#39;re going to action that link no

00:39:29.849 --> 00:39:32.720
Caption: because you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re

00:39:30.809 --> 00:39:34.969
Caption: going

00:39:32.719 --> 00:39:38.359
Caption: in this example here all of the links

00:39:34.969 --> 00:39:42.500
Caption: have the same text Government Gazette W

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:45.260

00:39:47.929 --> 00:39:52.510
Caption: you hear that date users not going to do

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.510
Caption: that

00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:58.499
Caption: people need to be able to enlarge the

00:39:54.718 --> 00:40:01.199
Caption: text you need at this ad with wicked -

00:39:58.499 --> 00:40:04.218
Caption: you need to be able to enlarge text 200%

00:40:01.199 --> 00:40:06.808
Caption: so you don&#39;t lose functionality or

00:40:04.218 --> 00:40:09.629
Caption: visibility of it in this case the

00:40:06.809 --> 00:40:11.880
Caption: carrots or the container was made with a

00:40:09.629 --> 00:40:13.679
Caption: fixed size rather than relative so it

00:40:11.879 --> 00:40:16.649
Caption: didn&#39;t move to accommodate the larger

00:40:13.679 --> 00:40:19.308
Caption: text in the next iteration of wicked

00:40:16.649 --> 00:40:22.798
Caption: which is 2.1 the requirements actually

00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:24.979
Caption: 400% in other words stop using fixed

00:40:22.799 --> 00:40:24.979
Caption: sizes

00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:29.449
Caption: look at the color contrast here even

00:40:27.858 --> 00:40:29.959
Caption: with good vision that&#39;s hard to see

00:40:29.449 --> 00:40:33.399
Caption: isn&#39;t it

00:40:29.959 --> 00:40:36.848
Caption: and then there&#39;s a gradient

00:40:33.399 --> 00:40:40.058
Caption: almost unusable for everybody

00:40:36.849 --> 00:40:43.059
Caption: what about this example if you&#39;re one of

00:40:40.059 --> 00:40:45.579
Caption: the 10 of 1 in 10 minutes in the world

00:40:43.059 --> 00:40:48.549
Caption: are colour-blind you&#39;re not going to be

00:40:45.579 --> 00:40:51.009
Caption: able to use that but that&#39;s not the only

00:40:48.549 --> 00:40:53.619
Caption: situation the fact is if I&#39;ve got a

00:40:51.009 --> 00:40:55.659
Caption: screen reader or blind or low vision how

00:40:53.618 --> 00:40:58.298
Caption: do I get that information about where

00:40:55.659 --> 00:41:00.788
Caption: that block of buck is we need to have

00:40:58.299 --> 00:41:02.799
Caption: some alternative text content don&#39;t we

00:41:00.789 --> 00:41:05.380
Caption: so that we can describe for the user

00:41:02.799 --> 00:41:06.729
Caption: where that is don&#39;t assume that people

00:41:05.379 --> 00:41:09.068
Caption: with disabilities don&#39;t purchase

00:41:06.729 --> 00:41:12.118
Caption: products buy cars take holidays all the

00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:12.119
Caption: rest of it they do

00:41:13.159 --> 00:41:16.818
Caption: in this example you can see some of the

00:41:15.799 --> 00:41:18.199
Caption: colors the same so you can probably

00:41:16.819 --> 00:41:21.289
Caption: figure out where that came from

00:41:18.199 --> 00:41:24.889
Caption: there&#39;s been no alternative text applied

00:41:21.289 --> 00:41:26.689
Caption: to any of those images so all the person

00:41:24.889 --> 00:41:31.250
Caption: would hear would be either image and

00:41:26.689 --> 00:41:32.479
Caption: nothing or image and a URL that we all

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:35.419
Caption: know some of them that can go on for

00:41:32.479 --> 00:41:37.189
Caption: lines and lines they aren&#39;t going to use

00:41:35.419 --> 00:41:40.038
Caption: it it&#39;s not going to tell them anything

00:41:37.189 --> 00:41:42.078
Caption: images that have information or convey
