  "description": "Machine learning is enabling computers to learn things which are not explicitly programmable. It\u2019s complex \u2013 involving equivalent amounts of maths and computer science. It\u2019s daunting and often hard to figure out where to start. Fast.Ai was created with the aim of helping developers and non-technical SME\u2019s build their own machine learning models. It provides a top-down approach which abstracts away the need for elaborate coding and complex theoretical concepts. Join me in an end to end demonstration of how to create a 95% accurate image classification model from scratch, using the Fast.Ai library. An ideal introduction to testing the waters in machine learning. \\n\\nAkanksha is a graduate Data Scientist at Readify learning all things data. She graduated from University College Cork, Ireland in 2018 with a degree in BSc Financial Maths and Actuarial Science. She is an advocate for women in STEM and is currently a co-organiser of Women Who Code Melbourne."
