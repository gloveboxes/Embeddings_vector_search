Caption: [Applause]

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:17.388
Caption: thanks Alex so easy to do this get a sec

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:25.618
Caption: cool Sertoma talk is forgetting your

00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:29.429
Caption: passwords with the web authentication

00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:30.899
Caption: API there&#39;s my twitter handle and hash

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.930
Caption: tags and all that kind of thing because

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.139
Caption: that&#39;s what we do these days who has

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.150
Caption: heard of the web authentication API

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:43.229
Caption: that&#39;s a lot of people I thought who has

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.870
Caption: used it too all right

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:47.729
Caption: and have you used it in production you

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:54.689
Caption: have Wow okay you maybe should be doing

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:56.790
Caption: this talk because I haven&#39;t yeah so who

00:00:54.689 --> 00:01:00.058
Caption: had a chance to look at that demo while

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.239
Caption: you&#39;re waiting filtering in and that&#39;s

00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:06.239
Caption: what five-ten did it work

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:08.430
Caption: great do you have iPhones great ok we&#39;ll

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:10.589
Caption: talk about that but we couldn&#39;t be here

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.849
Caption: today without our sponsors there are a

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:13.978
Caption: whole bunch of them they all give money

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:15.539
Caption: and without them this conference

00:01:13.978 --> 00:01:18.298
Caption: wouldn&#39;t happen or if it didn&#39;t it cost

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.369
Caption: you a lot more than $60 so thanks to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.829
Caption: them and the volunteers and the other

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.659
Caption: speakers and committee members lots of

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.909
Caption: people go into this day and it&#39;s a big

00:01:24.658 --> 00:01:29.368
Caption: one so what we&#39;re going to talk about

00:01:26.908 --> 00:01:31.139
Caption: today is I guess we&#39;re gonna set a

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.340
Caption: little bit of a make sure everyone&#39;s on

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:35.639
Caption: the same page we&#39;ll talk about what

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:36.839
Caption: authentication is why passwords are bad

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.189
Caption: and why would you try and get rid of

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:39.868
Caption: them

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.490
Caption: the web authentication if you I am how

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.499
Caption: that helps us get rid of passwords and

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:45.419
Caption: then talk about what that means in terms

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:48.959
Caption: of what we&#39;re gonna build for our users

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:52.618
Caption: so first of all authentication is about

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:54.839
Caption: proving your identity that can happen

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.159
Caption: through three ways at the moment we&#39;ve

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:58.438
Caption: got something you know which is usually

00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:59.998
Caption: a password or PIN number something you

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.479
Caption: have like your phone you get a text

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:05.158
Caption: message or something you which would be

00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:07.739
Caption: your fingerprint or your facial

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:09.300
Caption: recognition this kind of thing and the

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.940
Caption: way authentication works is we&#39;ll start

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.130
Caption: off with a gibe like Dave and Dave wants

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.020
Caption: to get into a club so he meets the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.610
Caption: bouncer when he gets to the front of

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.348
Caption: line the bouncer says hold on a second

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.369
Caption: mate dad guys here&#39;s my ID the bouncer

00:02:22.348 --> 00:02:24.899
Caption: has a look at that

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:27.000
Caption: looks at a few things on it and says

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:30.839
Caption: alright you&#39;re good to go that&#39;s I&#39;ve

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.550
Caption: verified who you are that&#39;s not quite or

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:35.009
Caption: fit authorization that&#39;s the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.660
Caption: authentication part of it so at this

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.500
Caption: point he knows that you are who it says

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.880
Caption: on a card

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.289
Caption: but he doesn&#39;t know if you&#39;re allowed

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.000
Caption: and that&#39;s going to be decided on things

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:44.279
Caption: like your age whether you&#39;re drunk

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.309
Caption: already if you&#39;re on a list or if you&#39;re

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:50.190
Caption: wearing the right shoes and the

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:53.580
Caption: important part of this exchange is the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.290
Caption: ID and the IDE has a few things on it

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.720
Caption: that help us know that it&#39;s only

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:59.250
Caption: improves who you are it&#39;s issued by for

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.720
Caption: example the Department of Transport

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.000
Caption: it&#39;s got Holograms and that kind of

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.199
Caption: thing and it&#39;s got a picture of you and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.518
Caption: we&#39;re looking at that picture and

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.949
Caption: knowing that you trust the document

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:10.559
Caption: itself you can trust that the person is

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.910
Caption: you let&#39;s say they are that&#39;s part of

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.619
Caption: the same thing we have with passwords

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.018
Caption: where it&#39;s something that I know and I

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.949
Caption: give to you and you can validate that

00:03:16.018 --> 00:03:19.190
Caption: that&#39;s right password

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:22.379
Caption: oh isn&#39;t if you&#39;re a server on the other

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.229
Caption: let&#39;s say yeah but passwords are really

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.870
Caption: bad for people to actually use you know

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:29.729
Caption: we&#39;re not good at creating passwords the

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:34.018
Caption: top ten passwords that are most

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:35.970
Caption: frequently used are all crap and I mean

00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:37.589
Caption: one two three four five six you you

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.609
Caption: wouldn&#39;t have a hard time guessing that

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:43.979
Caption: oh I suppose password I don&#39;t know the

00:03:41.608 --> 00:03:47.518
Caption: one that I&#39;m not sure about on there is

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:49.979
Caption: dragon number ten but between those ten

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:51.389
Caption: passwords that covers like one point six

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.708
Caption: percent of accounts which sounds like a

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.328
Caption: small number but if you think of

00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:57.089
Caption: Facebook with three or four billion

00:03:54.328 --> 00:03:59.970
Caption: accounts one point six percent is many

00:03:57.089 --> 00:04:01.798
Caption: millions so you know you don&#39;t need to

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.518
Caption: try a lot of passwords to get into a lot

00:04:01.798 --> 00:04:06.539
Caption: of accounts but you go yeah passwords on

00:04:05.518 --> 00:04:08.940
Caption: that list and that&#39;s a really bad

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:10.979
Caption: posture I know that you know I know that

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.319
Caption: I need to have a capital letter or I

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:14.849
Caption: need to put a number on the end or maybe

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.769
Caption: I replace one of the numbers do a symbol

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.130
Caption: and now I&#39;ve got a good password it&#39;s

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.229
Caption: all the complexity rules so those don&#39;t

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.679
Caption: really help either because you end up

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.360
Caption: with passwords like this and then you

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:28.259
Caption: have things like forced password changes

00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:29.849
Caption: you know let&#39;s say you&#39;re in a corporate

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.619
Caption: environment a lot of the time you&#39;ll

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.869
Caption: need to change your password every three

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:35.779
Caption: months so what do you do then you change

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:38.630
Caption: that number from a one to a two

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:40.130
Caption: and every three months you know you&#39;ve

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.380
Caption: been with the company you divide that

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:47.869
Caption: number by four and find out how long you

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.820
Caption: been there we&#39;re not very good at

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:51.320
Caption: remembering passwords either you know we

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.559
Caption: all know that we need to make different

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.200
Caption: passwords for every count but I reuse

00:04:54.559 --> 00:05:01.790
Caption: passwords all the time and 60% of people

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.680
Caption: will admit to it also and password

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.809
Caption: resets if you do forget they&#39;re really

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:07.339
Caption: slow they&#39;re expensive you know kind of

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:08.959
Caption: making having to call a help desk or sit

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:11.980
Caption: on a help desk and ask for a password

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:14.839
Caption: reset all day every day

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.339
Caption: so passwords are bad for everyone really

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:18.470
Caption: they&#39;re involved in things like data

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:21.139
Caption: breaches where your password gets leaked

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.459
Caption: anyway we reuse that password so if I

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.080
Caption: get on one site they can use it

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:25.429
Caption: everywhere

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:26.449
Caption: we&#39;ll use common passwords even if

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:27.889
Caption: you&#39;re not in a breach there&#39;s a

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.690
Caption: reasonable chance you can get in and

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.770
Caption: then you have things like phishing

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.350
Caption: attacks where I can just get your

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:35.539
Caption: password like that and all of those

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.950
Caption: problems come down to the password being

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.770
Caption: a shared secret something that both

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.279
Caption: parties need to know the person joined a

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:44.209
Caption: login for example and the server itself

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:47.059
Caption: so do you think you can trust all the

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:49.579
Caption: people with your secrets I don&#39;t but who

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:51.429
Caption: in the room wants to share a secret no

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:55.279
Caption: okay

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:57.229
Caption: 81% of all hacking related breaches come

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:58.970
Caption: from stolen passwords so that kind of

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.059
Caption: reinforces that maybe you can&#39;t trust

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.079
Caption: people with things that are secret and

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:04.880
Caption: then you get things like have I been

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:08.359
Caption: client and I&#39;ve ended up on here a few

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:11.600
Caption: times who else wants to admit to it most

00:06:08.359 --> 00:06:14.750
Caption: of the room so you know clearly we don&#39;t

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.279
Caption: we&#39;re not doing it all right and the way

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.399
Caption: we have traditionally dealt with

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:21.139
Caption: passwords as developers will go yeah I&#39;m

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:22.729
Caption: not sure I know how to do it so I&#39;ll

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.350
Caption: just implement social login let&#39;s

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:28.279
Caption: Facebook store passwords yeah they know

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.919
Caption: what they&#39;re doing but do they Facebook

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:32.720
Caption: github twitter Microsoft Google they&#39;ve

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:35.000
Caption: all had data breaches where passwords

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.769
Caption: have been exposed in plaintext often

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.130
Caption: that&#39;s when they&#39;re logging them in web

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:42.908
Caption: servers and that kind of thing so social

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.800
Caption: logins kind of out then well what about

00:06:42.908 --> 00:06:48.169
Caption: yeah multi-factor authentication I go I

00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:48.819
Caption: get an SMS every time I need to log into

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.610
Caption: a new device

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.640
Caption: and that&#39;s okay it&#39;s better than nothing

00:06:51.609 --> 00:06:56.619
Caption: certainly but it&#39;s not perfect either

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.720
Caption: this guy Sean Koontz lost a hundred

00:06:56.619 --> 00:07:00.250
Caption: grand in Bitcoin because someone stole

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.660
Caption: his password it&#39;s surprisingly easy to

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:06.609
Caption: do that I know I work for Telstra so

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.709
Caption: multi-factor authentication isn&#39;t great

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:11.289
Caption: either what if we didn&#39;t install

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:14.319
Caption: passwords at all that&#39;s where we end up

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.420
Caption: with the web authentication API the web

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.000
Caption: authentication API enables password list

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.370
Caption: authentication all simplifies using

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.049
Caption: multi-factor authentication and it does

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:25.329
Caption: this by delegating the responsibility

00:07:23.049 --> 00:07:26.889
Caption: for authenticating a user to their own

00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:29.019
Caption: device you don&#39;t need to do that

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.550
Caption: yourself you just get an assertion that

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:33.339
Caption: that person is who they say they are

00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:34.779
Caption: from a device and what that means is if

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:36.089
Caption: we never have to send a secret over the

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:39.429
Caption: Internet

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:44.290
Caption: so how do you use it well you can use

00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:47.619
Caption: one of these a Yubikey or similar please

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:49.690
Caption: go on but I did this offender the other

00:07:47.619 --> 00:07:50.949
Caption: day and every one more people had their

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:54.690
Caption: hands up than I thought it there as well

00:07:50.950 --> 00:08:00.940
Caption: so that was I don&#39;t know two dozen or so

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:03.940
Caption: whose mom has one okay so so it&#39;s a bit

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.739
Caption: of a challenge there what you call this

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.119
Caption: is an external Authenticator or a

00:08:05.739 --> 00:08:10.179
Caption: cross-platform or a roaming

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:12.790
Caption: Authenticator how about a fingerprint or

00:08:10.179 --> 00:08:13.750
Caption: I guess to be more specific a device

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:18.430
Caption: that lets you login with your

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:21.940
Caption: fingerprint like a phone a lot of people

00:08:18.429 --> 00:08:24.309
Caption: whose mom has one of those I&#39;m nice a

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.580
Caption: better number so to me that&#39;s where the

00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:29.589
Caption: promise for this API actually comes from

00:08:26.579 --> 00:08:34.289
Caption: these authenticators you can use your

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:36.190
Caption: Android phones or iPhones maybe as

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:38.979
Caption: authenticators in themselves so they

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.809
Caption: will actually prove that you are who you

00:08:38.979 --> 00:08:43.750
Caption: say you are by using your fingerprint

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:47.739
Caption: and those are called internal or

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.090
Caption: platform or bound authenticators so for

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:50.409
Caption: those who didn&#39;t get to do the demo I&#39;ll

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.940
Caption: show you roughly what that looks like

00:08:50.409 --> 00:08:53.379
Caption: and what what it means when you&#39;re

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.059
Caption: logging or what you have to do when

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.760
Caption: you&#39;re logging in using the web

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:59.260
Caption: authentication API so you start up on

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.729
Caption: this site for example web Wharton&#39;s are

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.249
Caption: higher

00:08:59.729 --> 00:09:03.838
Caption: and I&#39;ll enter my email username and I

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:06.179
Caption: don&#39;t yet enter a password and I click

00:09:03.838 --> 00:09:07.888
Caption: register I&#39;ll get a little prompt for my

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:09.480
Caption: browser telling me enter my security key

00:09:07.888 --> 00:09:11.188
Caption: or if you do it on your final ask me

00:09:09.479 --> 00:09:12.958
Caption: think fingerprint you probably have a

00:09:11.189 --> 00:09:16.410
Caption: few prompts before that to say what kind

00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:18.568
Caption: of care you want to use and then you you

00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:19.918
Caption: touch it and you get to go if you log in

00:09:18.568 --> 00:09:22.078
Caption: pretty much the same you just touch your

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:25.069
Caption: device so it&#39;s really simple you don&#39;t

00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:27.479
Caption: need to worry about doing a whole lot of

00:09:25.068 --> 00:09:28.888
Caption: validation of what that password is and

00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:31.318
Caption: making sure your hashing it because if

00:09:28.888 --> 00:09:32.758
Caption: there&#39;s no pass we&#39;re at the store so

00:09:31.318 --> 00:09:34.888
Caption: have a look at what actually does get

00:09:32.758 --> 00:09:36.958
Caption: sent around in this case the three main

00:09:34.888 --> 00:09:38.128
Caption: parties are your Authenticator I&#39;ve used

00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:41.278
Caption: that symbol but I could just as easily

00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:44.850
Caption: be your phone the browser and the

00:09:41.278 --> 00:09:47.489
Caption: website server so you start off by

00:09:44.849 --> 00:09:48.958
Caption: sending a username and maybe a password

00:09:47.489 --> 00:09:52.470
Caption: because I said you can use multi-factor

00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:54.028
Caption: authentication and then the server will

00:09:52.469 --> 00:09:57.208
Caption: respond with a challenge and the

00:09:54.028 --> 00:09:59.128
Caption: challenge is basically a sort of shared

00:09:57.208 --> 00:10:02.578
Caption: secret but it&#39;s not a secret so it&#39;s

00:09:59.129 --> 00:10:06.059
Caption: just something that both sides use at

00:10:02.578 --> 00:10:08.068
Caption: the end it also sent back some details

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:11.089
Caption: about the the website itself like a

00:10:08.068 --> 00:10:13.798
Caption: display name to display in those prompts

00:10:11.088 --> 00:10:15.148
Caption: and since details about what kind of

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:16.889
Caption: authenticate is it&#39;ll actually that you

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:18.628
Caption: use you know are you gonna let people

00:10:16.888 --> 00:10:22.708
Caption: use their phone or maybe you only let

00:10:18.629 --> 00:10:24.329
Caption: people use those hardware ones basically

00:10:22.708 --> 00:10:25.648
Caption: that gets passed on to the Authenticator

00:10:24.328 --> 00:10:27.298
Caption: and then the fennec adder will do its

00:10:25.648 --> 00:10:30.328
Caption: thing and you know you tap the button or

00:10:27.299 --> 00:10:32.939
Caption: whatever and respond back with some more

00:10:30.328 --> 00:10:36.118
Caption: data signature that needs to be verified

00:10:32.939 --> 00:10:38.549
Caption: by the server credential ID and a public

00:10:36.119 --> 00:10:40.019
Caption: key which needs to be stored above 0 so

00:10:38.549 --> 00:10:41.369
Caption: let&#39;s go to the browser obviously you&#39;ve

00:10:40.018 --> 00:10:46.138
Caption: got to get them to a server so you do

00:10:41.369 --> 00:10:47.730
Caption: that bit so now there are a few

00:10:46.138 --> 00:10:49.138
Caption: different parties here and we have

00:10:47.729 --> 00:10:51.028
Caption: different specs that actually define

00:10:49.138 --> 00:10:52.438
Caption: what that is so there&#39;s the web

00:10:51.028 --> 00:10:54.568
Caption: authentication API which you&#39;ll see

00:10:52.439 --> 00:10:56.999
Caption: shortened as web orphan a lot because

00:10:54.568 --> 00:10:59.398
Caption: typing out the web authentication API

00:10:56.999 --> 00:11:01.169
Caption: takes a bit longer and that defines what

00:10:59.398 --> 00:11:03.208
Caption: happens between your browser and the

00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:05.910
Caption: website server I guess the JavaScript

00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:07.438
Caption: website as well and then you have the

00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:08.908
Caption: client Authenticator protocol which

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:10.529
Caption: talks from the client to the

00:11:08.908 --> 00:11:12.179
Caption: Authenticator so that&#39;s from the browser

00:11:10.528 --> 00:11:15.479
Caption: or your operating system

00:11:12.179 --> 00:11:19.049
Caption: to the Authenticator itself and those

00:11:15.479 --> 00:11:22.199
Caption: together form photo too so a lot of time

00:11:19.049 --> 00:11:24.679
Caption: you&#39;ll look up and see flight o2 slicing

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:28.890
Caption: web forth and if you google or whatever

00:11:24.679 --> 00:11:30.419
Caption: and I talked a bit about the magic that

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.480
Caption: the Authenticator does so we can have a

00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:35.159
Caption: look a little bit of a look at that now

00:11:32.479 --> 00:11:36.719
Caption: the Authenticator has three million

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:39.709
Caption: things that it does firstly it verifies

00:11:36.719 --> 00:11:43.319
Caption: your identity and it does that through

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:46.740
Caption: possession and or a PIN number or a

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.330
Caption: biometric rating from that and that kind

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:49.529
Caption: of means you have two factors in one you

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.480
Caption: know we&#39;ll talk about two-factor

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:53.310
Caption: authentication being something you know

00:11:51.479 --> 00:11:55.799
Caption: and something you have or some of you

00:11:53.309 --> 00:11:57.210
Caption: are we&#39;ve kind of already got that by

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:59.729
Caption: being able to press a button that proves

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.260
Caption: that you have it and by having a pin

00:11:59.729 --> 00:12:03.209
Caption: that proves you know something or by

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.770
Caption: using a fingerprint proves that you are

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.600
Caption: something so you kind of get two factors

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:10.590
Caption: in one which is why you can use this as

00:12:06.599 --> 00:12:13.139
Caption: a strong single factor then what the

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:14.670
Caption: credential does is stores a credential

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.470
Caption: and that credential is scoped to the

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:18.959
Caption: website that you&#39;ve actually gone to it

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:20.309
Caption: stores you the URL and maybe a user ID

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.610
Caption: so you can login with multiple accounts

00:12:20.309 --> 00:12:26.820
Caption: on one website and what that means is

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:28.140
Caption: that the credential won&#39;t be given to

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.979
Caption: the wrong website so if you have a

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:33.570
Caption: phishing website it won&#39;t get your your

00:12:30.979 --> 00:12:35.609
Caption: transform information and even if it did

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.109
Caption: it&#39;s public anyway you know you have a

00:12:35.609 --> 00:12:40.589
Caption: public here you&#39;re not sending a product

00:12:37.109 --> 00:12:42.539
Caption: Kyocera so I&#39;m gonna say that means it&#39;s

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.920
Caption: unfishable but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll see

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:46.199
Caption: that written in any Docs because

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:48.679
Caption: security researchers I guess or wary of

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.450
Caption: when we call the Titanic an unsinkable

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:54.270
Caption: so take from that what you will

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:57.660
Caption: I&#39;m gonna clean it but I&#39;m not an

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:59.309
Caption: authority on that and that credential

00:12:57.659 --> 00:13:01.709
Caption: itself is actually an asymmetric key

00:12:59.309 --> 00:13:03.869
Caption: here so you have a private key which is

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:06.150
Caption: stored securely on the device never

00:13:03.869 --> 00:13:07.320
Caption: leaves the device in it it&#39;s kind of by

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.480
Caption: definition it&#39;s private

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.570
Caption: and it sends the public key up to the

00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:14.219
Caption: browser and then onto the server so how

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:17.580
Caption: does the public ke help you actually

00:13:14.219 --> 00:13:19.649
Caption: verify your identity you might be more

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.940
Caption: familiar with using public keys for

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.920
Caption: messaging Corrections for example I

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.369
Caption: thought if I have two people Alice and

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:25.349
Caption: Bob

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:27.510
Caption: Alice wants to write a message

00:13:25.349 --> 00:13:30.719
Caption: and Sam that&#39;s a bulb but also wants to

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:33.090
Caption: make sure that only Bob can read it so

00:13:30.719 --> 00:13:36.209
Caption: he wants to encrypt it in the middle the

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:39.570
Caption: way we do that these days is with public

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:42.420
Caption: key cryptography so this recipient in

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.590
Caption: this case Bob will have his public key

00:13:42.419 --> 00:13:45.889
Caption: in his private key he&#39;ll have to

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:48.480
Caption: generate them he doesn&#39;t have one and

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:51.179
Caption: you can use that public key to encrypt

00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:57.209
Caption: the message and the private key to

00:13:51.179 --> 00:14:00.479
Caption: decrypt the message that is okay but at

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:01.740
Caption: the moment Bob has his public key so if

00:14:00.479 --> 00:14:03.299
Caption: you wanted to encrypt the message you

00:14:01.739 --> 00:14:05.010
Caption: have to get it from Alice somehow anyway

00:14:03.299 --> 00:14:07.320
Caption: which means you don&#39;t have encrypt it in

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:09.630
Caption: the middle so because it&#39;s a public key

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.190
Caption: Bob can give that to Alice and then

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:14.429
Caption: Alice can use that to encrypt the

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:16.349
Caption: message and then you know the identity

00:14:14.429 --> 00:14:18.510
Caption: of the recipient is whoever&#39;s got that

00:14:16.349 --> 00:14:19.799
Caption: private key that&#39;s why you need to keep

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.880
Caption: the private key private because if you

00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:24.119
Caption: give it to anyone else they could

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.410
Caption: impersonate you and that&#39;s kind of the

00:14:24.119 --> 00:14:29.070
Caption: opposite of what we want we don&#39;t want

00:14:25.409 --> 00:14:30.629
Caption: to validate the recipient of the message

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.609
Caption: we want to validate the sender of the

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:34.830
Caption: message so to do that

00:14:32.609 --> 00:14:37.380
Caption: instead use Alice&#39;s public and private

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:39.809
Caption: keys and she can give her public key to

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:42.359
Caption: Bob encrypted the message with her

00:14:39.809 --> 00:14:45.390
Caption: private key and Bob can decrypt it or

00:14:42.359 --> 00:14:49.529
Caption: validate it with the public key and in

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:50.910
Caption: doing that it means that only Alice

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.410
Caption: could possibly have sent that message

00:14:50.909 --> 00:14:55.739
Caption: because she&#39;s the only one who has the

00:14:52.409 --> 00:14:57.629
Caption: ferrata key now in our case you could

00:14:55.739 --> 00:15:00.959
Caption: replace Alice with the Authenticator and

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:02.220
Caption: Bob with the website server so it&#39;s

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.420
Caption: essentially what we&#39;re doing here we&#39;ll

00:15:02.219 --> 00:15:06.569
Caption: send up a public key signed some

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:09.779
Caption: information and the server can use that

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:12.570
Caption: public key to validate it so the web

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:18.270
Caption: authentication API is pretty new you

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:19.500
Caption: might be wondering if you can use it so

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:23.010
Caption: you go to the de-facto Docs of the

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:25.349
Caption: internet MDM and you see this graph with

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:27.570
Caption: a bit of green in a bit of red and you

00:15:25.349 --> 00:15:30.419
Caption: wonder is that filling the whole story

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:32.640
Caption: you know I see ie in there and opera I

00:15:30.419 --> 00:15:35.849
Caption: don&#39;t know many people who use those by

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.890
Caption: default so you got a slightly different

00:15:35.849 --> 00:15:38.519
Caption: lens in the data and you can go there

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:41.100
Caption: can I use the

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.960
Caption: come and this shows the relative usage

00:15:41.099 --> 00:15:45.299
Caption: of each browser in terms of a height of

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.100
Caption: the column each browser is a different

00:15:45.299 --> 00:15:49.289
Caption: age different column is a different

00:15:47.099 --> 00:15:50.459
Caption: browser and the color of the column

00:15:49.289 --> 00:15:52.440
Caption: represents whether it&#39;s supportive or

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.660
Caption: not what&#39;s important about this view is

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.010
Caption: that there&#39;s a lot more green than red

00:15:53.659 --> 00:15:57.989
Caption: so globally it&#39;s available for basically

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:00.119
Caption: two thirds I think it&#39;s sixty eight

00:15:57.989 --> 00:16:03.869
Caption: point eight eight percent when I checked

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:05.070
Caption: it last Thursday or something so it&#39;s

00:16:03.869 --> 00:16:07.109
Caption: cool looks like a lot of people could

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:09.090
Caption: use this thing but then you got to think

00:16:07.109 --> 00:16:09.869
Caption: about your local demographic as well and

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.450
Caption: that regard

00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:14.789
Caption: Australia is special so all those people

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:17.250
Caption: with iPhones we now have a big red

00:16:14.789 --> 00:16:19.380
Caption: column and there&#39;s actually more red

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.830
Caption: than blue more rather than green on this

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.260
Caption: slide

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:26.239
Caption: roughly forty five percent of people in

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:28.290
Caption: Australia can use it at the moment now

00:16:26.239 --> 00:16:29.429
Caption: it gives us new things have been

00:16:28.289 --> 00:16:32.489
Caption: changing so I&#39;ll have a look at how

00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:35.339
Caption: that&#39;s been changing over time we start

00:16:32.489 --> 00:16:37.200
Caption: our little story in 2015 when edge first

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.520
Caption: released experimental support for

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.070
Caption: something like the web authentication

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:43.350
Caption: API it didn&#39;t exist at the time but it&#39;s

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.820
Caption: basically the same principle then

00:16:43.349 --> 00:16:46.979
Caption: because they were doing that and I

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:50.880
Caption: started working with the w3c and Mozilla

00:16:46.979 --> 00:16:52.079
Caption: and Fido we started getting some

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:57.059
Caption: progress and we had an actual

00:16:52.080 --> 00:17:00.480
Caption: specification in 2016 of our August edge

00:16:57.059 --> 00:17:02.909
Caption: released a spec compliant version that

00:17:00.479 --> 00:17:04.799
Caption: was again behind a feature flag and I

00:17:02.909 --> 00:17:07.319
Caption: had a little bit of a break nothing

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:12.959
Caption: happened in 2017 and we get into 2018

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:14.338
Caption: and about March or April Firefox enabled

00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.979
Caption: it before the hardware of indicators in

00:17:14.338 --> 00:17:18.630
Caption: the external ones so that&#39;s cool we&#39;ll

00:17:16.979 --> 00:17:22.380
Caption: finally got another browser and it&#39;s on

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:24.780
Caption: by default the same month chrome did the

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:27.479
Caption: same thing and then Dropbox enabled

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:30.420
Caption: using it as a second factor for logging

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:33.059
Caption: into their websites and then chrome

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.739
Caption: supported the on platform ones that you

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.560
Caption: fingerprint like Windows hello were you

00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:40.020
Caption: touch ID on your Mac and then edge

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.630
Caption: released it by default in November so

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:45.450
Caption: you&#39;ve already had a bit happening but

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:48.930
Caption: you still can&#39;t really use that platform

00:17:45.449 --> 00:17:49.799
Caption: of Education so come to this year then

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.060
Caption: in May

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:56.170
Caption: that&#39;s very much Firefox and I will

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:58.150
Caption: platform dedication w3c moved the spec

00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:01.840
Caption: to a recommendation which is basically

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:05.080
Caption: the final stage of a spec Safari engines

00:18:01.839 --> 00:18:10.179
Caption: experimental support on Mac OS not on

00:18:05.079 --> 00:18:12.579
Caption: iOS Android in April and they will all

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.800
Caption: Android devices 7 plus to act as those

00:18:12.579 --> 00:18:16.239
Caption: hardware platform with indicators so if

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.040
Caption: you did do the demo on an Android it

00:18:16.239 --> 00:18:18.550
Caption: would have worked well today if you do

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:23.170
Caption: it as well

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:24.310
Caption: and chrome actually started support

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.140
Caption: another manager as well which I guess

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:28.360
Caption: was kind of required for those that&#39;s

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:30.099
Caption: both happen so then you get to this

00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:31.780
Caption: point where you look at it today and if

00:18:30.099 --> 00:18:33.520
Caption: you&#39;re using Chrome or Firefox the

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.830
Caption: situation is pretty good you can use the

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.589
Caption: external authenticators all the internal

00:18:35.829 --> 00:18:43.119
Caption: authenticators on any device except for

00:18:38.589 --> 00:18:45.219
Caption: iOS and you guys yeah there&#39;s still a

00:18:43.119 --> 00:18:48.040
Caption: few gaps but if you went back a year it

00:18:45.219 --> 00:18:49.569
Caption: looked more like this and you couldn&#39;t

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.290
Caption: use those at all now as we were talking

00:18:49.569 --> 00:18:53.559
Caption: about before

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:54.930
Caption: a lot more people had finds smartphones

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.450
Caption: where your login with their fingerprint

00:18:54.930 --> 00:19:01.510
Caption: than the external authenticators so this

00:18:58.449 --> 00:19:02.829
Caption: is really where we need to focus and the

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:06.369
Caption: fact that we&#39;ve gone from nothing to

00:19:02.829 --> 00:19:10.149
Caption: this in a year is pretty good

00:19:06.369 --> 00:19:12.339
Caption: one day iOS will turn on the same thing

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:16.420
Caption: that Android did that sunny day in April

00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:17.859
Caption: and then we&#39;ll go from roughly 30% of

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.410
Caption: people being able to use it with the

00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:23.369
Caption: platform of indicator up to say 70

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:26.530
Caption: because iPhones are pretty good with

00:19:23.369 --> 00:19:30.520
Caption: having a little fragmentation between

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:32.859
Caption: different regions so you can look at

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:35.700
Caption: this and go cool you know it&#39;s got

00:19:32.859 --> 00:19:38.260
Caption: reasonable support now it&#39;s growing

00:19:35.699 --> 00:19:39.579
Caption: there are a few little quirks some

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.530
Caption: browsers support different things to

00:19:39.579 --> 00:19:43.929
Caption: others it&#39;s not really important what

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.250
Caption: all these boxes are but the red is not

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.500
Caption: supported and the yellow is in

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:49.359
Caption: development and you see there are a few

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.410
Caption: little boxes on each thing nothing is

00:19:49.359 --> 00:19:51.640
Caption: completely grained

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:54.880
Caption: so there are a few little quirks along

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.979
Caption: the way so we&#39;ve had a little bit of a

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.989
Caption: roller coaster there I don&#39;t know why

00:19:56.979 --> 00:20:00.429
Caption: they&#39;re wearing VR goggles I think if

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:04.410
Caption: you&#39;re on a roller coaster the VR

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:04.410
Caption: goggles are just gonna confuse you more

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:11.959
Caption: but basically by coming to today&#39;s talk

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:15.260
Caption: you can say that you like to web orphan

00:20:11.959 --> 00:20:17.989
Caption: before it was cool which has its own

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:21.500
Caption: little roller coaster so this is a view

00:20:17.989 --> 00:20:22.640
Caption: of like early adopters and innovators in

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.890
Caption: the early majority that kind of thing

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.928
Caption: and showing how how the actual

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.000
Caption: percentage that some who&#39;s used changes

00:20:26.928 --> 00:20:30.619
Caption: over time

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.298
Caption: now I would say we&#39;re right in this

00:20:30.619 --> 00:20:33.678
Caption: early adopters phase like I said we&#39;re

00:20:32.298 --> 00:20:37.579
Caption: at thirty percent you could kind of draw

00:20:33.678 --> 00:20:39.918
Caption: a line there and that would roughly at

00:20:37.579 --> 00:20:44.829
Caption: that point so I like to be an early

00:20:39.918 --> 00:20:48.229
Caption: adopter but hey Lily McGarry is cool too

00:20:44.829 --> 00:20:49.788
Caption: and basically you can still build this

00:20:48.229 --> 00:20:51.770
Caption: thing and offer it to users it&#39;s not

00:20:49.788 --> 00:20:54.259
Caption: going to take anything away from your

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.940
Caption: existing users but it does give

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.339
Caption: something you to these you do want to

00:20:55.939 --> 00:21:00.189
Caption: give it to so how do I do that well

00:20:58.339 --> 00:21:02.839
Caption: there&#39;s a JavaScript API like everything

00:21:00.189 --> 00:21:05.239
Caption: it&#39;s actually surprisingly simple this

00:21:02.839 --> 00:21:06.979
Caption: API there&#39;s a public key credential you

00:21:05.239 --> 00:21:10.130
Caption: can look for which will tell you if it&#39;s

00:21:06.979 --> 00:21:13.579
Caption: supported by the browser you can use

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:16.099
Caption: this it&#39;s a mouthful is user verifying

00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:17.538
Caption: platform Authenticator available and

00:21:16.099 --> 00:21:19.250
Caption: that will tell you if their device

00:21:17.538 --> 00:21:21.979
Caption: itself can act as a platform within a

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:23.808
Caption: cable so for example that&#39;ll tell you if

00:21:21.979 --> 00:21:26.390
Caption: you&#39;re using actually the device has

00:21:23.808 --> 00:21:29.148
Caption: Windows hello or touch ID or if these

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:31.070
Caption: guys think your friend on moist new

00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:33.380
Caption: phones that&#39;s gonna be the case and a

00:21:31.069 --> 00:21:36.259
Caption: lot of new devices have that too that&#39;s

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:38.359
Caption: cool then you&#39;ve got registration

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:42.529
Caption: through Windows navigator credentials

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:44.390
Caption: create with some options and getting

00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:47.690
Caption: that credential with kinda choice don&#39;t

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:49.329
Caption: get again with emotions we don&#39;t really

00:21:47.689 --> 00:21:51.048
Caption: have time to talk about what those are

00:21:49.329 --> 00:21:52.428
Caption: essentially that&#39;s the information

00:21:51.048 --> 00:21:53.989
Caption: they&#39;ve got sent between the different

00:21:52.428 --> 00:21:56.239
Caption: parts so if you&#39;ve got something from

00:21:53.989 --> 00:21:57.739
Caption: your server you would pass that through

00:21:56.239 --> 00:22:00.619
Caption: to the Authenticator and that&#39;s been

00:21:57.739 --> 00:22:01.969
Caption: basically the same information if you

00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:04.520
Caption: want to look go to web orphaned dot

00:22:01.969 --> 00:22:06.288
Caption: guide which is associated with with web

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.760
Caption: orphan do I owe I think the whole thing

00:22:06.288 --> 00:22:12.229
Caption: is built like you were so how do you

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.729
Caption: make it better for users so if I&#39;m

00:22:12.229 --> 00:22:16.250
Caption: telling you that you can actually start

00:22:13.729 --> 00:22:17.678
Caption: building this today what do you need to

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.928
Caption: do to make it

00:22:17.678 --> 00:22:22.308
Caption: well you&#39;ve got a few account management

00:22:20.928 --> 00:22:23.510
Caption: flaws to consider you know anyway you

00:22:22.308 --> 00:22:24.500
Caption: would have used the password and they

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.479
Caption: need to think about what you&#39;re gonna do

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.288
Caption: instead so you&#39;ve got things like

00:22:26.479 --> 00:22:29.839
Caption: registration

00:22:27.288 --> 00:22:32.089
Caption: you&#39;ve got login credential management

00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:35.658
Caption: and account recovery account recovery is

00:22:32.089 --> 00:22:38.510
Caption: a big one that we&#39;ll discuss but we&#39;ll

00:22:35.659 --> 00:22:40.370
Caption: get into the other ones first so you can

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:42.079
Caption: look at your registration page and go

00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:44.329
Caption: what information do we want to capture

00:22:42.079 --> 00:22:48.199
Caption: you know you probably need to use a name

00:22:44.329 --> 00:22:51.288
Caption: or email something like that you don&#39;t

00:22:48.199 --> 00:22:53.510
Caption: need a password necessarily and you live

00:22:51.288 --> 00:22:55.459
Caption: like a register button just go finish

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:57.169
Caption: the form but before we can decide

00:22:55.459 --> 00:22:58.788
Caption: exactly what stuff you need you go to

00:22:57.168 --> 00:23:01.579
Caption: the side if you want to use the web

00:22:58.788 --> 00:23:06.408
Caption: authentication API to do password let&#39;s

00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:09.798
Caption: login or as a second factor if you&#39;re

00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:11.270
Caption: gonna do password lists you may not

00:23:09.798 --> 00:23:13.308
Caption: require a password so you could probably

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.330
Caption: get rid of that field but at the same

00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:16.489
Caption: time you might want to still allow

00:23:14.329 --> 00:23:17.630
Caption: people to have a password there is

00:23:16.489 --> 00:23:19.939
Caption: always gonna be a trade-off between

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:21.949
Caption: security and convenience so if you do

00:23:19.939 --> 00:23:24.949
Caption: have a password you haven&#39;t gone quite

00:23:21.949 --> 00:23:29.000
Caption: as far with the security side but it&#39;s

00:23:24.949 --> 00:23:31.010
Caption: probably a better convenience for the

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.589
Caption: users because no-one&#39;s really used to

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.400
Caption: logging in with this thing yet then you

00:23:33.589 --> 00:23:37.038
Caption: got to think about if you&#39;re gonna

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.380
Caption: register the token now or later consider

00:23:37.038 --> 00:23:40.969
Caption: things like drop-off rates for filling

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:44.869
Caption: in the form if you add more friction

00:23:40.969 --> 00:23:46.189
Caption: than people might not sign up you must

00:23:44.869 --> 00:23:48.609
Caption: get your existing users to think about

00:23:46.189 --> 00:23:51.678
Caption: so how do you get them to start using it

00:23:48.609 --> 00:23:55.280
Caption: well for example you could put some

00:23:51.678 --> 00:23:56.928
Caption: hints on the login page maybe you have a

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.929
Caption: promise that users see after they&#39;ve

00:23:56.928 --> 00:24:01.158
Caption: logged in in this case your device is

00:23:59.928 --> 00:24:04.339
Caption: capable of logging in without a password

00:24:01.159 --> 00:24:05.750
Caption: and see if they want to register it and

00:24:04.339 --> 00:24:07.250
Caption: then you&#39;ve got things like deciding

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.380
Caption: what kind of messages you want to

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.729
Caption: display or how forceful you want to push

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:15.469
Caption: people into signing up for this new

00:24:10.729 --> 00:24:16.729
Caption: thing I guess it&#39;s all about considering

00:24:15.469 --> 00:24:18.380
Caption: what your users doing you can have

00:24:16.729 --> 00:24:19.959
Caption: analytics and those kind of things to

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.890
Caption: sell out as well

00:24:19.959 --> 00:24:23.089
Caption: it&#39;s also probably going to change your

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.099
Caption: login page if you&#39;re going past

00:24:23.089 --> 00:24:27.260
Caption: worthless if you&#39;re going past word

00:24:25.099 --> 00:24:29.069
Caption: lists you probably don&#39;t need the

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.930
Caption: password field

00:24:29.069 --> 00:24:32.669
Caption: but maybe you do you know maybe you give

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:34.380
Caption: that as an option maybe you have a

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:37.369
Caption: separate form for logging without a

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:39.569
Caption: password you can also go user nameless

00:24:37.369 --> 00:24:41.280
Caption: which is kind of cool so you might

00:24:39.569 --> 00:24:43.529
Caption: register with a username or not doesn&#39;t

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.760
Caption: really matter but your similar

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:47.880
Caption: authenticators can actually handle

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.640
Caption: storing keys on the device that you can

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.690
Caption: just look up so you get a browser prompt

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.670
Caption: there are more conditions to meet if you

00:24:51.689 --> 00:24:55.319
Caption: want to do this and the browser support

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:58.440
Caption: isn&#39;t as good that&#39;s one of those quirks

00:24:55.319 --> 00:25:00.959
Caption: at the moment today it&#39;s only supported

00:24:58.439 --> 00:25:04.039
Caption: an edge but the next versions of Chrome

00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:06.539
Caption: and Firefox will support that as well

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.310
Caption: and maybe you want to fall back to using

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:12.090
Caption: a password even if they are using

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:13.650
Caption: password let&#39;s login normally then you

00:25:12.089 --> 00:25:15.750
Caption: think about things like managing those

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:18.690
Caption: devices you know you might have one

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:21.599
Caption: Authenticator if you do buy a UV key or

00:25:18.689 --> 00:25:24.089
Caption: whatever you probably want to get to and

00:25:21.599 --> 00:25:24.660
Caption: then you can keep one on you so you can

00:25:24.089 --> 00:25:26.640
Caption: use it all the time

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.260
Caption: another one is it backup that you keep

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.570
Caption: in a drawer at home or whatever in case

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.250
Caption: you lose it

00:25:29.569 --> 00:25:35.880
Caption: so you gotta figure out where someone&#39;s

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:37.560
Caption: gonna go to manage those how you&#39;ll

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.479
Caption: identify those in it authenticated is on

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.970
Caption: that page you know maybe you&#39;ve got

00:25:39.479 --> 00:25:43.919
Caption: things like the date you last you still

00:25:41.969 --> 00:25:46.199
Caption: of the day you added it so that you can

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.570
Caption: decide if it hasn&#39;t been used in a while

00:25:46.199 --> 00:25:49.889
Caption: maybe you want to plate it and maybe

00:25:48.569 --> 00:25:51.679
Caption: further use it in a while you want to

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:53.940
Caption: prompt them to remove it

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.410
Caption: you know for their own security if they

00:25:53.939 --> 00:25:57.569
Caption: don&#39;t have that thing anymore that&#39;s the

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.979
Caption: way they can log into their account so

00:25:57.569 --> 00:26:02.939
Caption: you might want to from them to get rid

00:25:58.979 --> 00:26:05.189
Caption: of it if they don&#39;t have it another

00:26:02.939 --> 00:26:07.739
Caption: consideration at this point is if you

00:26:05.189 --> 00:26:09.719
Caption: only have a platform with indicator

00:26:07.739 --> 00:26:12.449
Caption: registered you can actually log in on

00:26:09.719 --> 00:26:14.489
Caption: any other device so that&#39;s where the

00:26:12.449 --> 00:26:18.859
Caption: password comes in is quite useful thing

00:26:14.489 --> 00:26:20.790
Caption: to have so what if I don&#39;t have a device

00:26:18.859 --> 00:26:22.500
Caption: yeah maybe let them login with a

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.330
Caption: password or think about some other way

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.099
Caption: you can let them login for example slack

00:26:24.329 --> 00:26:27.809
Caption: is like a magic link you could send you

00:26:26.099 --> 00:26:29.549
Caption: could do something similar if you&#39;re

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:32.460
Caption: gonna do that then you got to make sure

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.690
Caption: you&#39;ve got their email address and if

00:26:32.459 --> 00:26:35.039
Caption: they have got an email address you

00:26:33.689 --> 00:26:36.729
Caption: probably wanna make sure you&#39;ve verified

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.739
Caption: their email address otherwise

00:26:36.729 --> 00:26:43.239
Caption: just enter the wrong one and I can log

00:26:38.739 --> 00:26:45.969
Caption: into your account or whatever other

00:26:43.239 --> 00:26:47.589
Caption: people done in this case you know I

00:26:45.969 --> 00:26:49.058
Caption: don&#39;t want to be the first person to

00:26:47.589 --> 00:26:52.959
Caption: build this thing I&#39;m already not yes a

00:26:49.058 --> 00:26:54.880
Caption: payment to it but a lot of the big

00:26:52.959 --> 00:26:57.548
Caption: players like Google and Facebook and

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.619
Caption: github Twitter Dropbox have all

00:26:57.548 --> 00:27:01.569
Caption: influence of this in some fashion

00:26:59.619 --> 00:27:04.750
Caption: Microsoft accounts and that kind of

00:27:01.569 --> 00:27:07.750
Caption: thing as well they&#39;ve all kind of copped

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:09.520
Caption: out and gone for it as a second factor I

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.900
Caption: can understand it because there are a

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.910
Caption: lot more things to consider if you&#39;re

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:15.880
Caption: gonna go pass wordless like we&#39;re just

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:17.229
Caption: talking about but basically you go into

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.599
Caption: there you eyes and it looks something

00:27:17.229 --> 00:27:22.540
Caption: like this you have two factor

00:27:19.599 --> 00:27:24.308
Caption: authentication you have your devices you

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.320
Caption: can edit remove them change add

00:27:24.308 --> 00:27:28.869
Caption: nicknames to them so it&#39;s all pretty

00:27:26.319 --> 00:27:30.250
Caption: standard stuff and I guess but

00:27:28.869 --> 00:27:31.808
Caption: two-factor authentication that works

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.308
Caption: really well for them because they&#39;ve

00:27:31.808 --> 00:27:35.168
Caption: already got things like falling back to

00:27:33.308 --> 00:27:37.149
Caption: sending an SMS if you don&#39;t have your

00:27:35.168 --> 00:27:38.979
Caption: device on you so a lot of those things

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:44.080
Caption: that they would need to think about

00:27:38.979 --> 00:27:45.400
Caption: would change how would I do it I&#39;ve

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:48.880
Caption: asked a lot of questions along the way

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.640
Caption: and haven&#39;t really given you any answers

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.630
Caption: so as you probably do that at some point

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:57.630
Caption: so let&#39;s do a little bit of demo maybe

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:57.630
Caption: cool

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.040
Caption: a fun

00:28:09.099 --> 00:28:17.469
Caption: cool alright let&#39;s look at this right

00:28:11.918 --> 00:28:20.500
Caption: now super weird let&#39;s assume I&#39;m already

00:28:17.469 --> 00:28:24.969
Caption: a user of this website will call it way

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:26.649
Caption: bought them because taro says so I might

00:28:24.969 --> 00:28:27.668
Caption: decide that I want to login with my

00:28:26.649 --> 00:28:30.929
Caption: password because I have an existing

00:28:27.668 --> 00:28:33.508
Caption: account and then I get into this page

00:28:30.928 --> 00:28:35.768
Caption: probably what I&#39;ll do from there is

00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:37.210
Caption: check if I have a registered

00:28:35.769 --> 00:28:40.119
Caption: Authenticator at some code at the bottom

00:28:37.209 --> 00:28:41.558
Caption: here pseudo code eesh

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:44.019
Caption: you can&#39;t say we&#39;re up to clear those

00:28:41.558 --> 00:28:45.908
Caption: variables for example but basically

00:28:44.019 --> 00:28:48.190
Caption: you&#39;ll go see if they&#39;ve already got one

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:50.279
Caption: registered or if they&#39;ve ignored this

00:28:48.189 --> 00:28:52.569
Caption: prompt before you won&#39;t show it to them

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:55.240
Caption: then you can use that feature detection

00:28:52.569 --> 00:28:56.918
Caption: there is user verifying he&#39;s a user

00:28:55.239 --> 00:28:59.589
Caption: verifying platform with indicator

00:28:56.918 --> 00:29:01.119
Caption: available so check if it&#39;s available if

00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:03.668
Caption: it&#39;s not then you can&#39;t do anything if

00:29:01.119 --> 00:29:05.139
Caption: it is share them a prompt so we&#39;ll see

00:29:03.668 --> 00:29:08.079
Caption: what that looks like I&#39;ve hooked up to

00:29:05.139 --> 00:29:09.580
Caption: this little button because I had to I

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:11.888
Caption: couldn&#39;t show I scared away at this year

00:29:09.579 --> 00:29:13.178
Caption: to code so now you get that prompt the

00:29:11.889 --> 00:29:17.259
Caption: same form for showed you before pretty

00:29:13.178 --> 00:29:19.959
Caption: much you have a device name and register

00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:26.979
Caption: button remind me later if I enter a name

00:29:19.959 --> 00:29:28.719
Caption: like Windows I don&#39;t show you what the

00:29:26.979 --> 00:29:29.589
Caption: code would roughly be so for example

00:29:28.719 --> 00:29:31.209
Caption: when I click cancel

00:29:29.589 --> 00:29:34.109
Caption: I&#39;ll start selling your local stories to

00:29:31.209 --> 00:29:36.459
Caption: remind me later or something like that

00:29:34.109 --> 00:29:39.189
Caption: when I want to register that&#39;s the more

00:29:36.459 --> 00:29:41.500
Caption: interesting part so in that case I will

00:29:39.189 --> 00:29:43.239
Caption: do make a request to the server to get

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.189
Caption: that challenge and the Authenticator

00:29:43.239 --> 00:29:49.509
Caption: details the relying party details all

00:29:45.189 --> 00:29:51.069
Caption: that kind of stuff then I will basically

00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:53.409
Caption: do some transformations on that data

00:29:51.069 --> 00:29:55.178
Caption: because I get Jason can&#39;t send array

00:29:53.409 --> 00:29:58.059
Caption: buffers but the API actually expects

00:29:55.178 --> 00:30:00.339
Caption: array buffers I don&#39;t know why they made

00:29:58.058 --> 00:30:02.528
Caption: it harder to use but they did I guess

00:30:00.339 --> 00:30:07.569
Caption: maybe they&#39;re more secure or something

00:30:02.529 --> 00:30:08.980
Caption: oh it&#39;s smaller I guess so

00:30:07.569 --> 00:30:11.199
Caption: I get those options and I pass them

00:30:08.979 --> 00:30:13.869
Caption: through to window dot navigated

00:30:11.199 --> 00:30:15.699
Caption: credential we still create and once

00:30:13.869 --> 00:30:17.288
Caption: that&#39;s been created or get back a

00:30:15.699 --> 00:30:20.489
Caption: response from the Authenticator

00:30:17.288 --> 00:30:22.819
Caption: essentially which will maybe be

00:30:20.489 --> 00:30:25.890
Caption: because it can be canceled or might not

00:30:22.819 --> 00:30:29.669
Caption: so have to check for that in my response

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:32.010
Caption: handling then I will send through the

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:34.230
Caption: credential by the public key and the

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.459
Caption: current ID to the server get back a

00:30:34.229 --> 00:30:38.790
Caption: response from them and says they&#39;ve

00:30:35.459 --> 00:30:40.699
Caption: stored it and all that jazz and if that

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:42.989
Caption: was successful I closed the prompt it&#39;s

00:30:40.699 --> 00:30:45.359
Caption: not that much code really like this is

00:30:42.989 --> 00:30:47.130
Caption: kind of all I would have in the app in

00:30:45.359 --> 00:30:49.260
Caption: terms of register gonna make that a

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:51.900
Caption: reasonable function some way so could

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:56.280
Caption: president a few pages we&#39;re gonna go

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:58.109
Caption: ahead and register that and this is the

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.690
Caption: prompt they get so I have a PIN number

00:30:58.109 --> 00:31:05.459
Caption: NATO info I could get my Kiva that&#39;s

00:31:00.689 --> 00:31:07.649
Caption: more annoying is your thing and we&#39;re

00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:11.699
Caption: done normally you&#39;d probably want to

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:13.200
Caption: show things like your own prompt to

00:31:11.699 --> 00:31:14.489
Caption: explain to the user what&#39;s going to

00:31:13.199 --> 00:31:15.630
Caption: happen you know that they&#39;re going to

00:31:14.489 --> 00:31:17.400
Caption: get a prompt from their Authenticator

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:19.709
Caption: and then after we she probably wanted

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.099
Caption: success message or something for the

00:31:19.709 --> 00:31:24.299
Caption: sake of this demo assume that was there

00:31:22.099 --> 00:31:26.069
Caption: and then you look at things like

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.320
Caption: managing your credentials so I go to my

00:31:26.069 --> 00:31:30.779
Caption: account and then click on this world

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:32.309
Caption: credentials link I can see a list of

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:34.410
Caption: credentials that I already have

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:36.750
Caption: registered you&#39;ll notice that the

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:38.780
Caption: windows one isn&#39;t there because it&#39;s a

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:41.579
Caption: demo so I didn&#39;t bother looking it up

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:43.890
Caption: but you&#39;re still see everything you

00:31:41.579 --> 00:31:46.319
Caption: might need so I look at this and go oh

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:48.709
Caption: you the key five see I&#39;m using it well

00:31:46.319 --> 00:31:50.789
Caption: but I still own it so I&#39;ll keep it and

00:31:48.709 --> 00:31:53.969
Caption: NFC actually lost

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:57.510
Caption: so it&#39;s removed and that&#39;s gone I want

00:31:53.969 --> 00:32:02.579
Caption: to add a new one so like that forget my

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:05.070
Caption: prompt a quick of this particular one I

00:32:02.579 --> 00:32:07.890
Caption: guess is it it prompts you for part of

00:32:05.069 --> 00:32:09.959
Caption: the platform one if you have it unless

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:11.820
Caption: you tell it not to so I didn&#39;t tell them

00:32:09.959 --> 00:32:16.589
Caption: not to forget that I gotta click cancel

00:32:11.819 --> 00:32:19.769
Caption: that and then see what happens so I can

00:32:16.589 --> 00:32:22.079
Caption: insert my security key took my many USB

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:23.979
Caption: ports that are not taken up by other

00:32:22.079 --> 00:32:26.239
Caption: adapters

00:32:23.979 --> 00:32:27.410
Caption: I&#39;ve got a pin on this that&#39;s an

00:32:26.239 --> 00:32:28.010
Caption: optional thing you can set up with your

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.900
Caption: device

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:32.390
Caption: I recommend it because then you can use

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.619
Caption: it as those two factors if I didn&#39;t have

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:35.989
Caption: a pin I just need to press the button on

00:32:33.619 --> 00:32:38.569
Caption: it so that&#39;s not as secure and the pin

00:32:35.989 --> 00:32:43.429
Caption: is pretty low friction as well so I&#39;ll

00:32:38.569 --> 00:32:45.649
Caption: go ahead and answer that yes and no no

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:49.790
Caption: touch the button so big yellow button on

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:51.770
Caption: it I press that let&#39;s say oh that took

00:32:49.790 --> 00:33:00.260
Caption: this is actually the NFC one that I

00:32:51.770 --> 00:33:03.530
Caption: removed either back that&#39;s basically it

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:06.410
Caption: there&#39;s not a huge amount to it you know

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:09.770
Caption: let&#39;s say I log out and show you in

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:12.859
Caption: login with that device if it wants to

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:15.440
Caption: work so I&#39;ve got my username I&#39;d need to

00:33:12.859 --> 00:33:18.679
Caption: enter that still and they can click

00:33:15.439 --> 00:33:20.299
Caption: login it&#39;s pretty much the same thing

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:23.390
Caption: I&#39;ll get a prompt you can see what I&#39;ve

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.560
Caption: been testing so it&#39;s showing me all the

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:27.050
Caption: criminals that have registered for this

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.850
Caption: site and the many usernames and that

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.560
Caption: kind of thing

00:33:27.849 --> 00:33:32.119
Caption: so here it&#39;s got this way Bothan

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.520
Caption: workshop that&#39;s that display name that I

00:33:32.119 --> 00:33:36.650
Caption: said from the relying party I come for

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.119
Caption: you how to delete these by the way so I

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:40.640
Caption: would have thought I couldn&#39;t figure it

00:33:38.119 --> 00:33:42.559
Caption: out let&#39;s say I want to sign in as a

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:47.239
Caption: feel Eric you don&#39;t see he&#39;s never got

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:52.310
Caption: there okay again it&#39;s of a pin everyone

00:33:47.239 --> 00:33:57.469
Caption: loves a good pin we&#39;re in so that is

00:33:52.310 --> 00:34:00.650
Caption: pretty much how I would do it and we&#39;re

00:33:57.469 --> 00:34:02.000
Caption: gonna go just one step further and we&#39;ll

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:03.410
Caption: talk about what we talked about because

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.329
Caption: that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing these things I

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.560
Caption: talked a little bit about the problems

00:34:05.329 --> 00:34:08.750
Caption: with how we do with indication now you

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.030
Caption: know we&#39;re sending secrets over the

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:14.120
Caption: Internet which means that those secrets

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:15.560
Caption: can be taken by somebody else are we

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.330
Caption: talking about how web authentication is

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.239
Caption: better for us because the supports

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:23.630
Caption: growing and you don&#39;t need to have a

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:25.129
Caption: password so that&#39;s cool to the state of

00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:27.409
Caption: where Bothan where it&#39;s supported where

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:31.309
Caption: it&#39;s not supported iOS is unlucky

00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:32.419
Caption: actually on that iOS 13 is coming out in

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:37.330
Caption: like September

00:34:32.419 --> 00:34:37.329
Caption: probably that doesn&#39;t support either

00:34:37.618 --> 00:34:44.168
Caption: thanks Apple but hopefully that&#39;ll be in

00:34:40.779 --> 00:34:46.719
Caption: like 13.1 or something because Mac OS 13

00:34:44.168 --> 00:34:48.939
Caption: or Safari 13 on whichever version they

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:50.439
Caption: do will support by default so this

00:34:48.939 --> 00:34:52.510
Caption: talked earlier about the thing behind a

00:34:50.439 --> 00:34:55.178
Caption: feature flag the next version of Safari

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:57.609
Caption: which is probably also September will

00:34:55.178 --> 00:34:59.108
Caption: have that enabled by default so you know

00:34:57.608 --> 00:35:00.729
Caption: we got better again it&#39;s just iOS now

00:34:59.108 --> 00:35:04.288
Caption: that we need a wait for everyone else is

00:35:00.729 --> 00:35:06.338
Caption: fine what you see both that they well

00:35:04.289 --> 00:35:08.109
Caption: roughly that I mean if you want to

00:35:06.339 --> 00:35:10.059
Caption: follow Google instead of me which I

00:35:08.108 --> 00:35:12.699
Caption: could completely understand you could

00:35:10.059 --> 00:35:15.880
Caption: build it as a second factor but

00:35:12.699 --> 00:35:16.989
Caption: otherwise go with that and I get also

00:35:15.879 --> 00:35:19.929
Caption: gauging things to think about for

00:35:16.989 --> 00:35:22.389
Caption: tomorrow like like its how you gonna

00:35:19.929 --> 00:35:24.010
Caption: handle those new users or maybe you want

00:35:22.389 --> 00:35:27.760
Caption: to think about things like when you can

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:29.179
Caption: get rid of passwords altogether thank

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:35.590
Caption: you everybody

00:35:29.179 --> 00:35:35.589
Caption: [Applause]
