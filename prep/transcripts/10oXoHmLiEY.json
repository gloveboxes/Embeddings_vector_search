  "description": "What\u0027s this about?\\n \\nFrom industrial Northern 90\u0027s England to sunny 21st Century Perth - starting, growing and steering design teams through thick, thin and just plain weird - there\u0027s 25 years of Nick\u2019s experiences to be shared! Tales of woe, some unlikely successes, many leaps of faith and a few poignant reflections might just strike a note with and inspire those leading or aspiring to become a design, UX or software team leader.\\n \\nHow will this session run?\\n \\nThis won\u0027t be a presentation! We\u0027ll host a lively interview to surface and share tangible take outs, relayed through stories of starting out, succeeding, failing and leading.\\n \\nWhat will I get out of it?\\n \\nBeyond your sublime technical skills, learning how to work with people is foundational to your career. More than ever we\u0027re carving our own destiny, so through a series of reflections, anecdotes, projects and people experiences, you\u0027ll (hopefully!) come away armed with some new tools to help you navigate your career path.\\n \\nBetween them Nick and Jonathon have years of industry experience across many sectors. The deck will be shared for all, and Nick will be happy to elaborate, coach or otherwise share more throughout the event and beyond.\\n\\nNick Leigh\\nSince graduating with an honours degree in Business, Nick has dedicated his 20\u002B year career to design and design leadership. From a backyard startup through agency life to WA\u2019s biggest institutions, Nick has created \u2013 and built and lead \u2013 teams to create digital and physical experiences and artefacts across a broad spectrum of industries, platforms and brands. With entrepreneurial and leadership experience delivering design, digital and social marketing, customer and brand experience, and digital strategy and transformation projects, Nick is still humbly learning the idiosyncrasies of human-centred design. \\n\\nJonathan Steingiesser\\nJonathan is the Strategic Design Associate Director at Isobar where he divides his time between design strategy, customer research, consulting and service design improvements.
