Caption: your chair for this panel for the rest

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:30.059
Caption: of the session here today and I just

00:03:27.598 --> 00:03:32.158
Caption: briefly want to mention slido which is

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:34.619
Caption: the platform that you can go to if you

00:03:32.158 --> 00:03:37.378
Caption: haven&#39;t already to interact with the

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:38.518
Caption: panel today ask some questions have a

00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:42.119
Caption: look at the questions that have already

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:44.220
Caption: been asked upvote them and that&#39;s the

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:46.860
Caption: way that you can interact with these

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.798
Caption: fine folks on stage today

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.819
Caption: but given that we only have half an hour

00:03:48.798 --> 00:03:52.819
Caption: let&#39;s kick straight into it

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:59.098
Caption: and our first question which I&#39;m sure is

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.940
Caption: very topical uh given the market at the

00:03:59.098 --> 00:04:02.098
Caption: moment

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.440
Caption: what&#39;s the software developer employment

00:04:02.098 --> 00:04:06.839
Caption: ecosystem like at the moment if you&#39;re

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.699
Caption: wanting to hire a full-time developer do

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:11.699
Caption: you recruit locally do you recruit

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:14.220
Caption: overseas do you recruit remotely

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:16.018
Caption: Sam you&#39;re a VP of engineering you do a

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.919
Caption: lot of recruitment what&#39;s your take on

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.160
Caption: this

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.019
Caption: so I think it really depends on the size

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.380
Caption: of the organization and the maturity of

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.360
Caption: the process processes

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.119
Caption: so particularly if you were to consider

00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:33.239
Caption: the really small and a text startup

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:34.619
Caption: they&#39;re going to be very Dynamic it&#39;s

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:37.199
Caption: going to be a very fast-paced

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:39.179
Caption: environment so managing a like highly

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.699
Caption: remote or overseas particularly when

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:43.500
Caption: time zones are involved our Workforce is

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.239
Caption: going to be extremely challenging and

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.279
Caption: not really lead to the business outcomes

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:50.160
Caption: that are required at that stage for that

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:51.899
Caption: institution on the other hand on the

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.940
Caption: other hand if you&#39;re if the companies

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:56.100
Caption: like Google or I know any other kind of

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.380
Caption: large organization are more likely to

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.080
Caption: have rigorous process in place and

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.580
Caption: better support for people so I think

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:04.319
Caption: it&#39;s sort of a bit of a balancing act so

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:06.739
Caption: I think the larger organizations are

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.199
Caption: going to be more readily able to

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:11.699
Caption: remotely hire and then I think you know

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.199
Caption: in the middle there&#39;s probably a bit of

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.199
Caption: a mix and a bit of a balance

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:22.099
Caption: thank you very much uh on to a extremely

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:22.099
Caption: popular question next

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:28.638
Caption: should I add nfts or crypto to my

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.639
Caption: software project

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.940
Caption: Julie if you do it accessibly I guess

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.940
Caption: that&#39;s acceptable

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.199
Caption: uh rather Christina I believe we talked

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:41.519
Caption: about this last night what&#39;s what&#39;s your

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.000
Caption: thoughts on this matter

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:49.138
Caption: um I do a lot of startup advising and

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.859
Caption: I&#39;m going to say what advice I usually

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:55.800
Caption: give them so you know if you have

00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:57.839
Caption: something attached to

00:05:55.799 --> 00:06:00.179
Caption: somebody who&#39;s really popular it&#39;s a

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:02.519
Caption: celebrity it&#39;s something like that you

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:05.639
Caption: can trade it you can sell it you can

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:09.679
Caption: quickly turn it over it&#39;s while it still

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:12.720
Caption: holds its value then yes absolutely

00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:15.299
Caption: if not then it&#39;s just too risky

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.119
Caption: especially for like I said startups who

00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:20.940
Caption: are starting these new projects or or

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:24.419
Caption: people who maybe don&#39;t even quite

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:27.600
Caption: understand how data are transferred

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:30.000
Caption: along the way and the lifetime and the

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.039
Caption: sustainability of it I have somebody

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.839
Caption: that I worked with in fact who sits he&#39;s

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:38.759
Caption: like chairman of the board they formed a

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:43.739
Caption: nft commission now in Las Vegas and he&#39;s

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:47.699
Caption: a chairman and um he yeah I put this art

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:50.099
Caption: in here well okay but you put an art for

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:53.580
Caption: a famous artist that has significant

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:56.039
Caption: value already a lot of people that are

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:59.720
Caption: coming to him are having issues because

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:02.819
Caption: after people pass they can&#39;t access

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.919
Caption: their nft they can&#39;t access their stuff

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:06.839
Caption: and there&#39;s not a system in place for

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:10.740
Caption: that and that&#39;s a lot of money that

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:13.979
Caption: that&#39;s been lost we also in that same

00:07:10.739 --> 00:07:16.019
Caption: ecosystem had a basketball player who

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:18.660
Caption: took in like two and a half million

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:20.819
Caption: dollars on their Discord server and then

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.380
Caption: one day he said you know what

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:23.940
Caption: this is just really stressful I&#39;m

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.619
Caption: shutting everything down anybody who put

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.059
Caption: in fifteen hundred dollars I&#39;m just

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:29.339
Caption: going to give you a signed jersey and

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:31.799
Caption: thanks for playing and he took their 2.3

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:33.839
Caption: million dollars and left and it&#39;s

00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:36.000
Caption: there&#39;s no repercussions for that and

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:38.940
Caption: all of the kids that had looked up for

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.079
Caption: to him who didn&#39;t have the money to

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:44.819
Caption: invest in in what he was offering they

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:46.978
Caption: invested it anyway because he&#39;s like

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:48.839
Caption: they&#39;re cool Idol he took their money

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:51.660
Caption: and left and and those kids you know

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:53.639
Caption: they they can&#39;t get that money back so

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.339
Caption: um I I think that if you can turn it

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:58.559
Caption: over quickly and if it&#39;s attached to

00:07:56.339 --> 00:08:01.259
Caption: something that&#39;s high value and you can

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:03.720
Caption: get that value and extract it you know

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:06.479
Caption: within 12 months or so then it would be

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.279
Caption: worth it otherwise I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:12.000
Caption: the the use for that we have another

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:16.319
Caption: startup who&#39;s trying to attach uh grades

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.779
Caption: in schools to follow uh the the child

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:21.299
Caption: and their progression through their to

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:22.799
Caption: college and I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s

00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:24.839
Caption: sustainable the amount of energy and

00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:26.759
Caption: effort that&#39;s that&#39;s required to to

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:28.019
Caption: track all of that it&#39;s just it&#39;s not

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:29.819
Caption: there

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:32.659
Caption: and I think it&#39;s environmentally

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:32.659
Caption: irresponsible

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:38.218
Caption: well Samantha okay another really big

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:40.380
Caption: question

Caption: where will machine learning have the

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.239
Caption: biggest impact in the next 10 years

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:45.239
Caption: Serrata

00:08:45.599 --> 00:08:50.699
Caption: um it&#39;s a very tough question even we

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:51.778
Caption: will look back in Alaska last couple

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.260
Caption: months

00:08:51.778 --> 00:08:59.458
Caption: we have such a big big flow in

00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:02.100
Caption: generative area so I even can&#39;t imagine

00:08:59.458 --> 00:09:05.039
Caption: how the world going to be in the next

00:09:02.099 --> 00:09:06.719
Caption: few months so looking into you can just

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:09.119
Caption: type in a simple

00:09:06.719 --> 00:09:11.099
Caption: um text message to describe the scene

00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:13.919
Caption: and the computer can completely generate

00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:15.958
Caption: for you and also recently just have a

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:20.760
Caption: competition and the Machine already

00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:23.579
Caption: beaten the human so all these changes

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:26.100
Caption: um can be scary and I think one of the

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.260
Caption: speakers also talking about the defect

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:31.380
Caption: so I think we really need to worry about

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:34.799
Caption: the social impacts on what is Bill was

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:37.500
Caption: what is not real and for the longer

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:40.559
Caption: Horizons I really want to see the

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:43.640
Caption: medical research continue to improve and

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:47.820
Caption: have a big impact for our health

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:50.160
Caption: from I think it&#39;s more the regulatory to

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:53.580
Caption: catch up the technology rather than the

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:55.458
Caption: the dialysis on its own but I really

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:59.299
Caption: want to see that have a better

00:09:55.458 --> 00:09:59.299
Caption: improvement in our health system

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.540
Caption: all right thank you very much

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:04.979
Caption: I&#39;m going to throw this next one to

00:10:03.539 --> 00:10:06.659
Caption: Julie

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:08.838
Caption: so what&#39;s the first thing that you look

00:10:06.659 --> 00:10:11.099
Caption: for when doing an accessibility audit

00:10:08.838 --> 00:10:12.958
Caption: what do you do when you&#39;re building

00:10:11.099 --> 00:10:16.500
Caption: something new

00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:18.119
Caption: so if I&#39;m looking just starting out a

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.458
Caption: fresh audit the first thing that I

00:10:18.119 --> 00:10:21.898
Caption: always look at is I open up devtools and

00:10:20.458 --> 00:10:23.898
Caption: the elements panel and I look at the

00:10:21.898 --> 00:10:26.338
Caption: quality of the HTML

00:10:23.898 --> 00:10:29.159
Caption: that tells you a lot about where to

00:10:26.338 --> 00:10:32.039
Caption: pitch the rest of the testing and the

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:36.059
Caption: verification because good good quality

00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:38.159
Caption: HTML is the the basis of what goes into

00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:41.338
Caption: our accessibility API and then gets

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:44.219
Caption: passed on to assistive technology so you

00:10:41.338 --> 00:10:45.898
Caption: can learn so much from that part if I&#39;m

00:10:44.219 --> 00:10:47.759
Caption: testing I generally test heading

00:10:45.898 --> 00:10:49.799
Caption: structure first because that has a

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.640
Caption: benefit for so many people

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:56.518
Caption: uh if I&#39;m building something fresh I do

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.380
Caption: again start with that HTML

00:10:56.518 --> 00:11:01.919
Caption: um we sort of sometimes talk about the

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:04.320
Caption: accessibility stack uh being HTML CSS

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:07.979
Caption: JavaScript and Aria it&#39;s a purely

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:11.640
Caption: front-end stack and it&#39;s less of a stack

00:11:07.979 --> 00:11:14.760
Caption: and more of a pyramid with HTML giving

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.980
Caption: you so much accessibility for free that

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.018
Caption: if you get that right then everything

00:11:16.979 --> 00:11:21.299
Caption: else that you&#39;re doing is just enhancing

00:11:19.018 --> 00:11:23.760
Caption: and making more usable and extending to

00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:26.159
Caption: a wider range of people but that that

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.958
Caption: Bedrock if I could give one piece of

00:11:26.159 --> 00:11:30.419
Caption: accessibility advice to people who don&#39;t

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:33.359
Caption: have time to learn accessibility

00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:34.760
Caption: learn HTML really really get into those

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:36.958
Caption: mdn

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.440
Caption: definitions and really get to know it

00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.440
Caption: really well

00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:44.518
Caption: okay thank you very much I think this

00:11:42.359 --> 00:11:46.679
Caption: next one is a great question

00:11:44.518 --> 00:11:48.599
Caption: um and I I might actually throw it open

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:50.640
Caption: to the panel to see

00:11:48.599 --> 00:11:52.979
Caption: um maybe if there&#39;s multiple insights on

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.859
Caption: it but how do you convince your company

00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:57.059
Caption: to care about privacy and I assume from

00:11:55.859 --> 00:12:00.260
Caption: this perspective we&#39;re talking about the

00:11:57.059 --> 00:12:00.260
Caption: privacy of its customers

00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:06.119
Caption: I&#39;m actually going to jump in here and

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.859
Caption: say without being a privacy expert I

00:12:06.119 --> 00:12:09.119
Caption: have had experience with trying to get

00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:11.640
Caption: organizations to care about

00:12:09.119 --> 00:12:13.739
Caption: accessibility which along with security

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.440
Caption: is one of those things that seems a bit

00:12:13.739 --> 00:12:19.078
Caption: nebulous and fuzzy and how do you know

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:21.958
Caption: when you&#39;re doing it well but everybody

00:12:19.078 --> 00:12:23.359
Caption: puts it off to care about later after

00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:27.539
Caption: they&#39;ve shipped

00:12:23.359 --> 00:12:30.000
Caption: we tend to go for you you kind of need a

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:31.619
Caption: Grassroots kind of level of support and

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.919
Caption: often that comes from one person taking

00:12:31.619 --> 00:12:37.380
Caption: it on and becoming a champion but not

00:12:34.919 --> 00:12:39.119
Caption: telling other people off for doing it

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.099
Caption: wrong but more praising them when they

00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:41.880
Caption: get it right and

00:12:41.099 --> 00:12:45.119
Caption: um

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:47.220
Caption: being a bit pesty in meetings about

00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:49.018
Caption: um like oh yes this is an accessibility

00:12:47.219 --> 00:12:51.419
Caption: issue I assume you could do the same

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:53.880
Caption: with privacy this is a privacy issue we

00:12:51.419 --> 00:12:54.679
Caption: should absolutely be thinking about this

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.739
Caption: now

00:12:54.679 --> 00:13:02.638
Caption: and then buttonhole the people in charge

00:12:58.739 --> 00:13:04.880
Caption: and harass them into caring because you

00:13:02.638 --> 00:13:07.619
Caption: will not leave them alone until they do

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.239
Caption: this sounds very informal but it&#39;s been

00:13:07.619 --> 00:13:10.820
Caption: a winning formula for many many large

00:13:09.239 --> 00:13:13.919
Caption: organizations

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:16.500
Caption: this is being recorded being sent out so

00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:18.659
Caption: sorry to my clients

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.778
Caption: I can chew in a little bit as well

00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:24.299
Caption: because I deal with medical data so um

00:13:21.778 --> 00:13:26.578
Caption: it&#39;s in view in the organization level

00:13:24.299 --> 00:13:29.638
Caption: they&#39;re already aware the importance of

00:13:26.578 --> 00:13:33.179
Caption: the privacy but from the development

00:13:29.638 --> 00:13:35.699
Caption: side we also concerned about we put it

00:13:33.179 --> 00:13:37.078
Caption: on the cloud service where&#39;s the

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:40.079
Caption: location

00:13:37.078 --> 00:13:42.778
Caption: um we share the responsibility make sure

00:13:40.078 --> 00:13:45.479
Caption: we have the white assets so and also

00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:47.159
Caption: reminding them your your boss if they

00:13:45.479 --> 00:13:50.099
Caption: fail to do it they will have a big fight

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:52.379
Caption: on the gdpr so yeah they will make the

00:13:50.099 --> 00:13:55.500
Caption: decision

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.599
Caption: yeah it&#39;s great I think it&#39;s a great oh

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.599
Caption: Sam thanks yeah

00:13:57.599 --> 00:14:02.219
Caption: um this is a kind of funny one but

00:14:00.599 --> 00:14:04.739
Caption: I think

00:14:02.219 --> 00:14:05.518
Caption: like what as Julie said

00:14:04.739 --> 00:14:07.380
Caption: um

00:14:05.518 --> 00:14:09.599
Caption: if you can hire someone whose

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.518
Caption: responsibility it is to really focus on

00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:13.500
Caption: privacy and keep up to date particularly

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:15.239
Caption: from a legal perspective and what that

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.898
Caption: means to your organization and that&#39;s

00:14:15.239 --> 00:14:21.059
Caption: sort of a huge win but then obviously

00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:23.638
Caption: getting executive support in that and

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:26.638
Caption: really creating a culture so privacy

00:14:23.638 --> 00:14:28.979
Caption: really is a cultural issue so it&#39;s

00:14:26.638 --> 00:14:32.398
Caption: making everyone understand what it means

00:14:28.979 --> 00:14:35.338
Caption: but to customers and what it means like

00:14:32.398 --> 00:14:37.979
Caption: what&#39;s stored in data and then rather

00:14:35.338 --> 00:14:39.838
Caption: than I guess to use a

00:14:37.979 --> 00:14:42.719
Caption: perhaps important but rather than to

00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:44.219
Caption: bore people with legal jargon it&#39;s

00:14:42.719 --> 00:14:48.059
Caption: really great if you&#39;ve got that champion

00:14:44.219 --> 00:14:50.000
Caption: or sort of I guess ambassador to

00:14:48.059 --> 00:14:52.320
Caption: um sort of

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.359
Caption: re-relay what it means to individual

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.458
Caption: teams and how that like provides simple

00:14:54.359 --> 00:14:59.159
Caption: patterns for how that they can approach

00:14:56.458 --> 00:15:01.559
Caption: privacy in their day-to-day work

00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:03.479
Caption: yeah great input from all of our

00:15:01.559 --> 00:15:07.159
Caption: panelists there I&#39;m going to change

00:15:03.479 --> 00:15:10.859
Caption: gears slightly here and move more to

00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:13.919
Caption: individual development and the way that

00:15:10.859 --> 00:15:14.698
Caption: that&#39;s aligned in the market right now

00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:16.799
Caption: um

00:15:14.698 --> 00:15:19.018
Caption: what&#39;s the best thing that I can invest

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:22.578
Caption: in outside of work to make myself

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:22.578
Caption: attractive to an employer

00:15:23.099 --> 00:15:28.979
Caption: do a lot of career mentorship for

00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:32.638
Caption: developers specifically and about how to

00:15:28.979 --> 00:15:35.278
Caption: lead from within and so an investment

00:15:32.638 --> 00:15:37.018
Caption: really is in yourself and making

00:15:35.278 --> 00:15:40.018
Caption: yourself look attractive and the way

00:15:37.018 --> 00:15:42.719
Caption: that we do that is by helping other

00:15:40.018 --> 00:15:47.760
Caption: people and lifting them up you build a

00:15:42.719 --> 00:15:50.879
Caption: community around you you build a a tribe

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.799
Caption: of of advocates for yourself and so

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.359
Caption: they&#39;re going to be allies they&#39;re going

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:58.260
Caption: to be supporters they&#39;re going to be

00:15:54.359 --> 00:16:01.880
Caption: sponsors and you become

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:04.919
Caption: um you know this brand that is

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:07.559
Caption: essentially somebody who is a leader now

00:16:04.919 --> 00:16:10.138
Caption: you already have a brand whether you

00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:12.479
Caption: want to admit it or not right so as

00:16:10.138 --> 00:16:15.299
Caption: you&#39;re sitting in your team you already

00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:18.419
Caption: are represented representing certain

00:16:15.299 --> 00:16:22.799
Caption: values you are representing how you

00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:26.578
Caption: present a how you are showing up in with

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:29.338
Caption: your a dress your appearance your

00:16:26.578 --> 00:16:30.659
Caption: attitudes you already have a brand the

00:16:29.338 --> 00:16:33.359
Caption: difference of course is that you&#39;re just

00:16:30.659 --> 00:16:36.119
Caption: going to be more intentional about that

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:38.159
Caption: brand so I would advise everybody to go

00:16:36.119 --> 00:16:40.559
Caption: home and think about your top three to

00:16:38.159 --> 00:16:42.299
Caption: five core values that make you tick and

00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:44.159
Caption: then start making your choices your

00:16:42.299 --> 00:16:46.559
Caption: decisions start living your life around

00:16:44.159 --> 00:16:47.940
Caption: those those core values what&#39;s going to

00:16:46.559 --> 00:16:50.578
Caption: happen is you start to attract other

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:53.398
Caption: people who share those core values those

00:16:50.578 --> 00:16:55.859
Caption: people like what you have they want to

00:16:53.398 --> 00:16:57.719
Caption: start doing what you do and in fact

00:16:55.859 --> 00:17:00.119
Caption: they&#39;re going to lift you up when they

00:16:57.719 --> 00:17:03.119
Caption: recognize somebody else doing those

00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:05.219
Caption: things oh you should go talk to to Joe

00:17:03.119 --> 00:17:07.318
Caption: because you know Joe does that he loves

00:17:05.219 --> 00:17:09.239
Caption: that you should go talk to Susie Susie

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:11.698
Caption: loves doing that and so suddenly you

00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:14.938
Caption: start to create this brand for yourself

00:17:11.698 --> 00:17:17.280
Caption: and then you know decide to pick two

00:17:14.938 --> 00:17:19.678
Caption: different platforms to put that content

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.799
Caption: out that represent your brand maybe it&#39;s

00:17:19.678 --> 00:17:24.838
Caption: tick tock maybe it&#39;s Facebook maybe it&#39;s

00:17:22.798 --> 00:17:27.058
Caption: just one-on-one speaking with people

00:17:24.838 --> 00:17:29.099
Caption: because that&#39;s that&#39;s what works for you

00:17:27.058 --> 00:17:31.219
Caption: maybe you send out some press releases I

00:17:29.099 --> 00:17:34.319
Caption: don&#39;t know but you can create yourself

00:17:31.219 --> 00:17:36.058
Caption: as a brand and you can lead within from

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:38.099
Caption: within you don&#39;t have to be a leader you

00:17:36.058 --> 00:17:39.298
Caption: don&#39;t have to have a title

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:41.880
Caption: um because at the end of the day you

00:17:39.298 --> 00:17:43.798
Caption: already have a reputation so it&#39;s up to

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:48.199
Caption: you to kind of guide those conversations

00:17:43.798 --> 00:17:48.199
Caption: and around that that reputation

00:17:48.538 --> 00:17:54.439
Caption: thank you very much Christina

00:17:50.579 --> 00:17:57.359
Caption: so let&#39;s say I&#39;ve built my brand and

00:17:54.439 --> 00:18:00.259
Caption: I&#39;ve got my job

00:17:57.359 --> 00:18:02.459
Caption: so in Perth right now

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:05.640
Caption: salaries are

00:18:02.459 --> 00:18:07.859
Caption: you know growing there&#39;s a bit of a

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.440
Caption: certainly been a lot of heat in the

00:18:07.859 --> 00:18:13.619
Caption: market so to speak

00:18:09.439 --> 00:18:15.599
Caption: so I might throw this to Sam first but

00:18:13.619 --> 00:18:18.119
Caption: is this just a bubble like is this just

00:18:15.599 --> 00:18:19.619
Caption: a temporary thing should I be concerned

00:18:18.119 --> 00:18:21.719
Caption: if I&#39;m an engineer in the market right

00:18:19.619 --> 00:18:24.538
Caption: now

00:18:21.719 --> 00:18:27.000
Caption: uh that&#39;s a good question I don&#39;t have

00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:29.879
Caption: the crystal ball I think that might be

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.160
Caption: tiny bit of a bubble but realistically

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.780
Caption: it&#39;s my own personal take is that we

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.760
Caption: don&#39;t really need to worry too much

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.859
Caption: about that but just rather focus on

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.058
Caption: ourselves and focus on on our work and

00:18:37.859 --> 00:18:40.678
Caption: really

00:18:39.058 --> 00:18:42.239
Caption: um

00:18:40.678 --> 00:18:44.399
Caption: yeah make sure that we&#39;re we&#39;re being

00:18:42.239 --> 00:18:46.760
Caption: our best Mis and and I think we&#39;ll we&#39;ll

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.760
Caption: be okay

00:18:49.918 --> 00:18:53.699
Caption: on a somewhat related note

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.500
Caption: so if you&#39;re a graduate and you&#39;re

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:57.599
Caption: entering the market right now

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.699
Caption: um it&#39;s obviously a bit different for

00:18:57.599 --> 00:19:02.280
Caption: than how it would be a few years ago

00:18:59.699 --> 00:19:04.038
Caption: even given covert and remote work and

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.900
Caption: and things like that

00:19:04.038 --> 00:19:08.459
Caption: does the panel think that we&#39;re able to

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:11.520
Caption: give grads enough support in their early

00:19:08.459 --> 00:19:13.079
Caption: years in the industry at the moment

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.539
Caption: thank you

00:19:13.079 --> 00:19:18.019
Caption: Christina what do you think

00:19:15.538 --> 00:19:22.279
Caption: um I think that if your communication

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:25.679
Caption: processes and the way that you&#39;re

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:27.719
Caption: organizing in your teams is done well

00:19:25.678 --> 00:19:29.760
Caption: with diversity equity and inclusion then

00:19:27.719 --> 00:19:32.219
Caption: that&#39;s not really an issue people can

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:35.400
Caption: still feel connected as long as we are

00:19:32.219 --> 00:19:38.520
Caption: creating systems that allow them to be

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:40.760
Caption: connected in multiple different ways and

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.799
Caption: so having

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:46.199
Caption: diverse voices that feel like they&#39;re

00:19:43.798 --> 00:19:48.479
Caption: being heard if if you have that already

00:19:46.199 --> 00:19:50.699
Caption: then you don&#39;t have to worry about it

00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:53.699
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s not really an issue I have

00:19:50.699 --> 00:19:55.558
Caption: many friends who lead remote teams all

00:19:53.699 --> 00:19:57.000
Caption: over the world that are have never even

00:19:55.558 --> 00:19:58.380
Caption: met in person and they&#39;re very

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.479
Caption: successful and they&#39;re very connected

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.520
Caption: and sometimes when they do meet up at

00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:04.260
Caption: conferences their besties and it&#39;s

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.880
Caption: awesome because they already are very

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.500
Caption: familiar with what&#39;s going on in each

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:12.500
Caption: other&#39;s lives they have multiple ways

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:15.538
Caption: for communicating and the Nuance in that

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:18.839
Caption: has to be prioritized the new one months

00:20:15.538 --> 00:20:21.538
Caption: of communication has to be prioritized

00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:24.479
Caption: through documentation through multiple

00:20:21.538 --> 00:20:26.839
Caption: ways of communicating and through

00:20:24.479 --> 00:20:26.839
Caption: respect

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:33.900
Caption: okay great answer

00:20:31.558 --> 00:20:35.699
Caption: I might throw the next one to Serato if

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:39.000
Caption: I&#39;m an application developer but I want

00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:41.339
Caption: to move into working with AI or ml

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.640
Caption: how best is it to make that move how do

00:20:41.339 --> 00:20:43.640
Caption: I start

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:51.479
Caption: Ed you don&#39;t need to pay for anything

00:20:48.558 --> 00:20:54.479
Caption: from the resources you want to learn

00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:57.660
Caption: from to the computer power there is no

00:20:54.479 --> 00:20:59.400
Caption: excuse not to learn and I can point you

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:02.960
Caption: to a perfect machine learning group and

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:08.099
Caption: I follow on Farsi ISL I did it myself

00:21:02.959 --> 00:21:10.079
Caption: and I continue following I I just enjoy

00:21:08.099 --> 00:21:13.439
Caption: every moment

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:16.500
Caption: all the new technology what I can apply

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:18.659
Caption: for it&#39;s just so exciting the world is

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:21.599
Caption: changing so fast but in a in a good way

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.580
Caption: so come and join us or chat with me

00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:25.678
Caption: afterwards so I can point you to some

00:21:23.579 --> 00:21:28.859
Caption: resources and fast AI is fantastic

00:21:25.678 --> 00:21:32.239
Caption: community and that&#39;s a lot of

00:21:28.859 --> 00:21:35.158
Caption: opportunity to contribute to open source

00:21:32.239 --> 00:21:39.020
Caption: environment so it also can help you to

00:21:35.159 --> 00:21:39.020
Caption: prepare yourself for your next move

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.500
Caption: okay I think the next one is a probably

00:21:45.359 --> 00:21:52.439
Caption: a good one to throw uh over to

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:54.418
Caption: well anyone on the panel really but I

00:21:52.439 --> 00:21:55.918
Caption: might start with Julie because we were

00:21:54.418 --> 00:21:58.380
Caption: talking about

00:21:55.918 --> 00:22:00.779
Caption: um flying around the place last night

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:02.640
Caption: number of the panelists here have you

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:05.460
Caption: know flown around the world and talked

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.380
Caption: in various cities Jacob asks is the

00:22:05.459 --> 00:22:09.538
Caption: Perth technology sector lacking anything

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:12.900
Caption: in particular compared to the eastern

00:22:09.538 --> 00:22:14.939
Caption: states or overseas right now or is in

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.859
Caption: the era of remote work is that not

00:22:14.939 --> 00:22:18.719
Caption: really an issue

00:22:16.859 --> 00:22:21.900
Caption: yeah we were talking about this last

00:22:18.719 --> 00:22:24.599
Caption: night I I&#39;m incredibly biased on this

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:27.179
Caption: though in that I don&#39;t think that the

00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:29.640
Caption: Perth sector if there is if there are

00:22:27.178 --> 00:22:31.500
Caption: gaps and I&#39;m sure people can identify

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.479
Caption: them I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s anything

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:37.859
Caption: lacking in our capability or our

00:22:33.479 --> 00:22:41.579
Caption: capacity to grow and fill those gaps in

00:22:37.859 --> 00:22:44.640
Caption: terms of working remotely uh intopia is

00:22:41.579 --> 00:22:46.380
Caption: a fully distributed organization so I&#39;m

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.539
Caption: the only employee in Perth but we have

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:52.739
Caption: people all around Australia in New

00:22:48.538 --> 00:22:55.619
Caption: Zealand in America and in Canada and in

00:22:52.739 --> 00:22:58.859
Caption: general we&#39;ve found the quality of

00:22:55.619 --> 00:23:02.099
Caption: people that we find to be pretty similar

00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:06.058
Caption: all around so again I&#39;m the only one in

00:23:02.099 --> 00:23:06.900
Caption: Perth until Loren came to visit us so

00:23:06.058 --> 00:23:09.119
Caption: um

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:12.000
Caption: yeah I I might be incredibly biased on

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:13.859
Caption: that but I do think that there is a lot

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.520
Caption: of strength and a lot of resilience and

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:21.359
Caption: creativity in Perth so if there&#39;s any

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:23.580
Caption: particular language sets or skill sets

00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:25.918
Caption: that are missing I think that&#39;s just a

00:23:23.579 --> 00:23:27.899
Caption: case of okay fine we identify them and

00:23:25.918 --> 00:23:29.759
Caption: we fill those gaps

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.900
Caption: but I&#39;ll pass over to people who are

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.900
Caption: possibly less biased

00:23:33.239 --> 00:23:37.500
Caption: yeah I think it&#39;s

00:23:35.339 --> 00:23:39.298
Caption: um sort of just a function of our

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.579
Caption: population really so I think we&#39;ve got

00:23:39.298 --> 00:23:42.899
Caption: everything just in smaller amounts and

00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:43.558
Caption: so

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.080
Caption: um

00:23:43.558 --> 00:23:48.658
Caption: like on a daily day for me is one of

00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:51.239
Caption: those little Sparks in the the Perth

00:23:48.659 --> 00:23:52.620
Caption: sort of tech scene

00:23:51.239 --> 00:23:54.418
Caption: um

00:23:52.619 --> 00:23:56.520
Caption: I&#39;d love to see more investment in Tech

00:23:54.418 --> 00:23:59.099
Caption: and more startups and growth here and

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.900
Caption: more conferences like this one

00:23:59.099 --> 00:24:03.418
Caption: um but yeah I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.919
Caption: fundamental lack of skills I just think

00:24:03.418 --> 00:24:07.439
Caption: it&#39;s a functionality sorry just a

00:24:04.918 --> 00:24:09.899
Caption: function of us being a comparatively

00:24:07.439 --> 00:24:12.259
Caption: small and in a relatively isolated part

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.260
Caption: of the world

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.280
Caption: Okay so we&#39;ve got about five minutes

00:24:15.479 --> 00:24:20.038
Caption: left I&#39;m going to jump around to a few

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:23.340
Caption: fun ones here that I&#39;ve gotten the list

00:24:20.038 --> 00:24:25.019
Caption: what&#39;s a boring technology that people

00:24:23.339 --> 00:24:27.119
Caption: or companies should use more forget

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.679
Caption: about web3 and blockchain for a moment

00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:29.459
Caption: what&#39;s something boring we should look

00:24:28.678 --> 00:24:31.558
Caption: at

00:24:29.459 --> 00:24:34.520
Caption: embracing my mic to my mouth to get in

00:24:31.558 --> 00:24:34.520
Caption: first HTML

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:42.178
Caption: it&#39;s the handy dandy go anywhere

00:24:38.058 --> 00:24:44.819
Caption: do anything kind of Swiss army knife as

00:24:42.178 --> 00:24:47.760
Caption: far as boring Tech goes HTML is actually

00:24:44.819 --> 00:24:50.579
Caption: pretty bloody great

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:53.820
Caption: look out throw out one

00:24:50.579 --> 00:24:56.519
Caption: um any any of the languages that are

00:24:53.819 --> 00:24:59.519
Caption: used for infrastructure as code so cloud

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.299
Caption: formation does anyone like yaml

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.179
Caption: um

00:25:00.298 --> 00:25:04.500
Caption: HCL for terraform I don&#39;t know I&#39;m

00:25:03.178 --> 00:25:06.959
Caption: probably going to get murdered by a few

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.459
Caption: people after this fellow

00:25:06.959 --> 00:25:11.418
Caption: those kinds of things but we need to do

00:25:08.459 --> 00:25:11.418
Caption: more infrastructure as code

00:25:11.579 --> 00:25:18.199
Caption: for me I don&#39;t know SQL so I I know

00:25:17.038 --> 00:25:20.639
Caption: people will

00:25:18.199 --> 00:25:22.319
Caption: disagree with me but for me

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.119
Caption: um

00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:27.298
Caption: when I have an interview and people ask

00:25:24.119 --> 00:25:30.900
Caption: me my skill or SQL I I can do other

00:25:27.298 --> 00:25:33.359
Caption: things using other languages I don&#39;t

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.460
Caption: like SQL and also it&#39;s an indicator for

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:37.439
Caption: me that will be a very boring and very

00:25:35.459 --> 00:25:39.538
Caption: dirty job I am also doing the cleaning

00:25:37.439 --> 00:25:43.579
Caption: more than doing the machine learning so

00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:43.579
Caption: SQL for me is the dirty words

00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:51.658
Caption: okay has anyone got a fun War Story to

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:54.859
Caption: share from the last year

00:25:51.659 --> 00:25:54.860
Caption: in what context

00:25:57.359 --> 00:26:02.719
Caption: not any that my clients would be happy

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.719
Caption: for me to have recorded

00:26:05.579 --> 00:26:09.739
Caption: many War Stories but none that are fun

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.719
Caption: I think I think we&#39;ve all been there

00:26:12.839 --> 00:26:18.298
Caption: okay uh

00:26:15.719 --> 00:26:19.619
Caption: well here&#39;s a uh here&#39;s something that&#39;s

00:26:18.298 --> 00:26:21.959
Caption: a little bit different

00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:24.658
Caption: what is the meaning of life as a

00:26:21.959 --> 00:26:26.158
Caption: developer in your eyes and bearing in

00:26:24.659 --> 00:26:29.880
Caption: mind that we all know that the answer is

00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:32.880
Caption: 42 uh what else do you think the meaning

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:36.058
Caption: of life as a developer is Christina yes

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:38.039
Caption: I&#39;m super excited to answer this I work

00:26:36.058 --> 00:26:39.839
Caption: Ed really really hard with my mentees to

00:26:38.038 --> 00:26:43.079
Caption: teach them creative problem solving

00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:46.199
Caption: because it&#39;s all about critical thinking

00:26:43.079 --> 00:26:48.298
Caption: and solving problems a lot of times the

00:26:46.199 --> 00:26:51.058
Caption: people that I work with just enjoy

00:26:48.298 --> 00:26:52.859
Caption: working on things and chewing on things

00:26:51.058 --> 00:26:56.819
Caption: and a lot of times they like the

00:26:52.859 --> 00:27:00.119
Caption: accolades as well and for me I try to

00:26:56.819 --> 00:27:02.099
Caption: help shift them to the empathetic side

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:04.500
Caption: right I&#39;m the emotional intelligence

00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:06.178
Caption: woman so I&#39;m always looking at how we

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:10.140
Caption: connect our products and services with

00:27:06.178 --> 00:27:12.899
Caption: empathy with kindness and with

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:16.500
Caption: Innovation to to the people that are are

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:19.500
Caption: using them and I try to

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.538
Caption: in part into people that those creative

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.599
Caption: problem solving skills those thinking

00:27:21.538 --> 00:27:28.019
Caption: skills that often come so naturally to

00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:30.178
Caption: people in our industry and they&#39;re very

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.320
Caption: very valuable and and you can sometimes

00:27:30.178 --> 00:27:32.939
Caption: just take that for granted because

00:27:31.319 --> 00:27:34.979
Caption: you&#39;re surrounded with other people who

00:27:32.939 --> 00:27:37.558
Caption: are doing that but if you think about

00:27:34.979 --> 00:27:39.900
Caption: the those problem-solving skills that

00:27:37.558 --> 00:27:43.798
Caption: you have and how you can use the tools

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:45.900
Caption: to really work on solving some of these

00:27:43.798 --> 00:27:48.899
Caption: difficult challenging problems of the

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:51.260
Caption: world that has a deep and and greater

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.260
Caption: purpose

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:57.119
Caption: that&#39;s a fantastic answer so I&#39;m gonna

00:27:54.599 --> 00:27:58.619
Caption: I&#39;m gonna end on one I&#39;m gonna ask

00:27:57.119 --> 00:28:00.959
Caption: um each of our panelists this question

00:27:58.619 --> 00:28:03.298
Caption: uh because it is the most popular

00:28:00.959 --> 00:28:04.979
Caption: question on left on the app right now

00:28:03.298 --> 00:28:07.139
Caption: we&#39;ve covered a little bit already so

00:28:04.979 --> 00:28:09.778
Caption: I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna Riff on it a little

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:12.659
Caption: bit so the original question asks what&#39;s

00:28:09.779 --> 00:28:15.840
Caption: the hype with web3 it feels like it&#39;s a

00:28:12.659 --> 00:28:18.480
Caption: waste of time and money and has no value

00:28:15.839 --> 00:28:20.939
Caption: I&#39;ll extend that a little bit

00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:22.739
Caption: one of the things we criticize about as

00:28:20.939 --> 00:28:25.500
Caption: technologists is we get distracted by

00:28:22.739 --> 00:28:28.079
Caption: the next sort of shiny thing

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.400
Caption: how do we distinguish the next shiny

00:28:28.079 --> 00:28:31.260
Caption: thing from something that actually has

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.900
Caption: value how do we actually dig in and

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:35.339
Caption: understand whether that has value Sam

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.619
Caption: I&#39;ll start with you and then we&#39;ll go

00:28:35.339 --> 00:28:39.359
Caption: around the panel

00:28:37.619 --> 00:28:41.279
Caption: it&#39;s a very good question

00:28:39.359 --> 00:28:43.260
Caption: um

00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:45.720
Caption: I&#39;d like to believe that everything has

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:47.880
Caption: value and that the current form is

00:28:45.719 --> 00:28:49.380
Caption: likely to to change over time but there

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.599
Caption: are some underlying principles and so

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.760
Caption: it&#39;s really just finding that sort of

00:28:51.599 --> 00:28:56.099
Caption: almost like product Market fit where

00:28:53.760 --> 00:29:00.659
Caption: there&#39;s an evolution and so what we see

00:28:56.099 --> 00:29:02.400
Caption: now is might be hard to really

00:29:00.659 --> 00:29:04.260
Caption: understand what it&#39;s going to look like

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.900
Caption: in the future but I wouldn&#39;t be

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:10.558
Caption: surprised if we we see something that

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:12.659
Caption: resembles not the web 3 of today but you

00:29:10.558 --> 00:29:14.219
Caption: know a particular application going

00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:15.840
Caption: forward but certainly right now I can

00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:19.158
Caption: understand why people would be feeling a

00:29:15.839 --> 00:29:19.158
Caption: bit dubious about it

00:29:20.279 --> 00:29:25.559
Caption: um I definitely agree with Sam about the

00:29:23.159 --> 00:29:28.740
Caption: pot and Margaret fit and then adding

00:29:25.558 --> 00:29:31.319
Caption: value to the problem but that means we

00:29:28.739 --> 00:29:34.140
Caption: actually really need the domain expert

00:29:31.319 --> 00:29:37.439
Caption: to understand the problem and apply the

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:40.140
Caption: technology technology is a set should be

00:29:37.439 --> 00:29:43.139
Caption: a second secondary rather than the

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:46.440
Caption: primary we should more always focus on

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:49.859
Caption: solving the problem and at Value to the

00:29:46.439 --> 00:29:52.619
Caption: situation the cat is shiny and next day

00:29:49.859 --> 00:29:54.599
Caption: they were gone so even the language we

00:29:52.619 --> 00:29:57.000
Caption: learned today may be not applicable in

00:29:54.599 --> 00:29:59.278
Caption: couple of years so don&#39;t hang on to the

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.899
Caption: technology focused on the problem and

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:05.100
Caption: solving it

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:08.100
Caption: I think there is a small part of the

00:30:05.099 --> 00:30:11.219
Caption: community that is going to enjoy

00:30:08.099 --> 00:30:13.380
Caption: spending time with their their goggles

00:30:11.219 --> 00:30:15.538
Caption: on right and there are already people in

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:17.159
Caption: the metaverse who really like certain

00:30:15.538 --> 00:30:19.079
Caption: things and and that&#39;s where they find

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:22.020
Caption: connection and that&#39;s great and it&#39;s a

00:30:19.079 --> 00:30:24.359
Caption: certain subset of the population and so

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.940
Caption: I think for that it does have value

00:30:24.359 --> 00:30:29.158
Caption: right for people who it&#39;s valuable if

00:30:26.939 --> 00:30:31.678
Caption: you have skins if you if you can buy

00:30:29.159 --> 00:30:33.299
Caption: certain things if you can have okay yeah

00:30:31.678 --> 00:30:35.038
Caption: we want to put some effort I can

00:30:33.298 --> 00:30:37.380
Caption: understand how companies want to do

00:30:35.038 --> 00:30:39.418
Caption: marketing within the metaverse and stuff

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:41.699
Caption: like that I get it but you know the

00:30:39.418 --> 00:30:45.898
Caption: reality is is that it&#39;s like 10 000

00:30:41.699 --> 00:30:48.178
Caption: people own a third of the crypto and I

00:30:45.899 --> 00:30:51.539
Caption: mean at that point and and there&#39;s

00:30:48.178 --> 00:30:53.880
Caption: something like 50 of the wallet keys are

00:30:51.538 --> 00:30:56.639
Caption: lost like you never will ever see them

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.279
Caption: again and so with that level there&#39;s

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:01.500
Caption: really it&#39;s it&#39;s not really practical

00:30:58.279 --> 00:31:04.200
Caption: for like me what&#39;s what&#39;s the the

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:07.319
Caption: motivation for me to get into that when

00:31:04.199 --> 00:31:09.418
Caption: there&#39;s there&#39;s ten thousand people who

00:31:07.319 --> 00:31:11.099
Caption: are already going to hold it there&#39;s a

00:31:09.418 --> 00:31:13.019
Caption: small percentage of of the population

00:31:11.099 --> 00:31:14.699
Caption: that&#39;s holding it and then what happens

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:18.599
Caption: is we end up having all of these other

00:31:14.699 --> 00:31:20.158
Caption: kids again who can&#39;t afford it this is

00:31:18.599 --> 00:31:22.558
Caption: um and they&#39;re they&#39;re spending a lot of

00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:24.600
Caption: money and they&#39;re doing it wrong you can

00:31:22.558 --> 00:31:27.119
Caption: do it right though I have mentees who

00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:30.058
Caption: paid off their mom&#39;s entire house it was

00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:31.739
Caption: you know they had a 65 000 mortgage loan

00:31:30.058 --> 00:31:34.619
Caption: and these kids paid it off playing

00:31:31.739 --> 00:31:38.459
Caption: Esports games they&#39;re amazing

00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:41.459
Caption: um I I have other people who are using

00:31:38.459 --> 00:31:45.479
Caption: it to their advantage for testing things

00:31:41.459 --> 00:31:47.219
Caption: or for um training during remote teams

00:31:45.479 --> 00:31:49.798
Caption: um you know that&#39;s that&#39;s a good use of

00:31:47.219 --> 00:31:51.479
Caption: it will it take over our future and oh

00:31:49.798 --> 00:31:53.278
Caption: my gosh everybody&#39;s going to be into

00:31:51.479 --> 00:31:57.298
Caption: this and we all have to jump to the next

00:31:53.279 --> 00:32:00.480
Caption: shiny thing no I I don&#39;t think so no

00:31:57.298 --> 00:32:03.178
Caption: I yeah tend to agree with everybody here

00:32:00.479 --> 00:32:06.058
Caption: um my own thinking on this is very much

00:32:03.178 --> 00:32:09.178
Caption: about how when I first started learning

00:32:06.058 --> 00:32:11.699
Caption: to make websites it was very much like

00:32:09.178 --> 00:32:13.739
Caption: I can I have I can make a thing and put

00:32:11.699 --> 00:32:15.418
Caption: it out in the world and other people can

00:32:13.739 --> 00:32:17.219
Caption: just show up and look at it and we don&#39;t

00:32:15.418 --> 00:32:21.178
Caption: need Rupert Murdoch&#39;s permission to do

00:32:17.219 --> 00:32:23.038
Caption: so a lot of the extra hype comes from

00:32:21.178 --> 00:32:24.778
Caption: people inserting themselves as a

00:32:23.038 --> 00:32:27.000
Caption: middleman in a process so that they can

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:29.820
Caption: extract a profit

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.699
Caption: um I think the real longevity and

00:32:29.819 --> 00:32:33.959
Caption: promise of

00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:36.418
Caption: computing and software and the internet

00:32:33.959 --> 00:32:41.359
Caption: comes from those underlying patterns and

00:32:36.418 --> 00:32:44.278
Caption: principles of openness transparency

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:45.599
Caption: interoperability and so if those are the

00:32:44.279 --> 00:32:47.279
Caption: patterns and principles that you&#39;re

00:32:45.599 --> 00:32:50.278
Caption: working with and then you learn a

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:52.740
Caption: language that lets you work with that to

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:55.200
Caption: solve the problem that you have and then

00:32:52.739 --> 00:32:57.298
Caption: some business people can come along and

00:32:55.199 --> 00:32:59.158
Caption: think about Market propositions or

00:32:57.298 --> 00:33:02.339
Caption: something maybe that&#39;s just I&#39;m just too

00:32:59.159 --> 00:33:04.620
Caption: much of a nerd to care about that

00:33:02.339 --> 00:33:06.538
Caption: um I&#39;m lucky to have one of one of my

00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:07.798
Caption: bosses cares about that very much and he

00:33:06.538 --> 00:33:08.939
Caption: thinks about that and I don&#39;t have to

00:33:07.798 --> 00:33:12.058
Caption: worry about it

00:33:08.939 --> 00:33:13.918
Caption: um but I think if anyone is thinking

00:33:12.058 --> 00:33:15.678
Caption: about how do you getting back to that

00:33:13.918 --> 00:33:18.418
Caption: question about how do you decide between

00:33:15.678 --> 00:33:21.418
Caption: what&#39;s worth your time learning versus

00:33:18.418 --> 00:33:25.500
Caption: what&#39;s going to be a flash in the pan I

00:33:21.418 --> 00:33:28.859
Caption: think I will recommend a talk given here

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:31.439
Caption: in Perth a few years back at a mixing

00:33:28.859 --> 00:33:35.339
Caption: called Full stack anxiety full stack

00:33:31.439 --> 00:33:37.619
Caption: anxiety by Joel Khalifa and I found that

00:33:35.339 --> 00:33:39.178
Caption: talk really useful to me in mapping out

00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:41.459
Caption: where I am now

00:33:39.178 --> 00:33:43.979
Caption: the goals I want to have the kinds of

00:33:41.459 --> 00:33:47.880
Caption: things I want to build and what skills

00:33:43.979 --> 00:33:50.599
Caption: do I need to learn to reach that goal so

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:52.678
Caption: if that&#39;s for anyone it is on YouTube

00:33:50.599 --> 00:33:54.658
Caption: and you should be able to get a hold of

00:33:52.678 --> 00:33:57.119
Caption: it so maybe if that&#39;s a concern for you
