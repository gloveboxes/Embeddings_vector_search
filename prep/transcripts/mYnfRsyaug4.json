  "description": "Trading shares is a complex proposition. There is potentially an enormous volume of information to consider, news articles, announcements, economic indicators, world events and even the time of day. How can anyone distil all of that into a successful trade? What if there was a way to \u201Cconsider\u201D data and determine if it was tradeable, that is, can be used to make profitable share trades? Enter machine learning!\\n \\nIn this talk, we will explore how to use machine learning models to decide what shares to trade and when while wading through a daunting array of disparate data types. With this base level of shared understanding established, we will explore techniques of how to run machine learning at scale as well as practical techniques to automate the creation, development, scoring and deployment of machine learning models. Hope to see you there!\\n\\n--\\nDavid Martin is currently the Technical Lead for the Covid-19 response for the WA Health Department.

Who knows, he just might make a few dollars along the way."
