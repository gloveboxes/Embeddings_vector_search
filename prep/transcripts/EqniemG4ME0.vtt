00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.629

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.559
Caption: ladies come out of this room today

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:26.119
Caption: feeling a little bit how to bring your

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:29.119
Caption: unconscious bias into consciousness and

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.120
Caption: also

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.529
Caption: that&#39;s wrong this is me

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.360
Caption: and other things that I want to talk

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:47.819
Caption: about here is barri actually pulled

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.619
Caption: their biases so between the ages of 0

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:55.110
Caption: instead is when we Bourne Identity

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.560
Caption: so things to do means that parents say

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.169
Caption: to us whatever you say about others what

00:01:58.559 --> 00:02:04.489
Caption: our education says their environment

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:04.489
Caption: dictates shapes

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.919
Caption: sir and suddenly the peace around us

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.660
Caption: also cultures that we interact with it

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:20.660
Caption: helps pool in those stereotypes

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.660
Caption: statements

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:30.090
Caption: from the ages of 17

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:34.250
Caption: we mirror so we then find evidence to

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:34.250
Caption: back up whatever that story might be

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:45.230
Caption: so for me stories around race became a

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.729
Caption: really big thing so

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:49.729
Caption: during the 80s and 90s

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.620
Caption: efficiently ancient invention now I&#39;m

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:02.679
Caption: born in Australia but I was on the

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:05.330
Caption: receiving end of a lot of that

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:08.000
Caption: sorry what happened was I actually

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.160
Caption: internalized all of that racism towards

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.910
Caption: myself I thought that I wasn&#39;t ready

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.910
Caption: that I wasn&#39;t belong

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:23.020
Caption: so I&#39;m going to improve connectivity I&#39;m

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.110
Caption: some of uniforms or pads or whatever I

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:30.080
Caption: think I&#39;m gonna say a few words for you

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.259
Caption: today fill in the blank so for example

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.259
Caption: [Music]

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.018
Caption: [Music]

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.958
Caption: leaders up

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:48.958
Caption: this thing that comes to mind

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.779
Caption: [Laughter]

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:13.569
Caption: so some of you have might have written

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:15.779
Caption: down some really awesome things just

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.779
Caption: right

00:04:23.239 --> 00:04:29.489
Caption: so I&#39;ll get in touch with anyone so a

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:34.339
Caption: negative belief is some money might be

00:04:29.489 --> 00:04:36.630
Caption: that values scarcity I have the belief

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:38.869
Caption: it&#39;s not really helpful when I run a

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.059
Caption: business

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:43.829
Caption: when you try to accumulate wealth if you

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:49.250
Caption: think that&#39;s angle what you do is you

00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:49.250
Caption: spend it and get rizzoli as possible

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:56.479
Caption: so the positive

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.479
Caption: grace money is abundant

00:04:57.408 --> 00:05:01.250
Caption: money is an exchange of energy

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:08.179
Caption: money can be used to support my friends

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:08.179
Caption: and my family myself

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.740
Caption: so we might take those beliefs of

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:16.199
Caption: scarcity around my user for me I grew up

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:18.769
Caption: in the low socio-economic space and

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:22.369
Caption: believe that my name is really hard

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:24.799
Caption: really hard to get everybody else had it

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:30.179
Caption: 

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:32.959
Caption: and so really hard to shift that belief

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:37.039
Caption: into

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:37.039
Caption: because who would I get to baby

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:45.299
Caption: it wasn&#39;t content

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:49.098
Caption: and the same thing goes for when they

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:53.970
Caption: talking about women in tech

00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:55.829
Caption: so for me I was going into communication

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:00.019
Caption: select a cell stroke and I was a

00:05:55.829 --> 00:06:00.019
Caption: business manager to Telstra pull that

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:08.149
Caption: down

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.149
Caption: I&#39;m going to turn down to the I

00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:11.299
Caption: engines

00:06:16.908 --> 00:06:23.509
Caption: so I just want to flip that

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:23.509
Caption: empowering men

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:31.609
Caption: that I&#39;ve been a bad thing

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:42.498
Caption: [Music]

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.800
Caption: because what I didn&#39;t realize was that

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:06.799
Caption: was unconscious

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:15.949
Caption: and she was like whoa what

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:21.378
Caption: was wrong

00:07:30.019 --> 00:07:36.769
Caption: sorry

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:36.770
Caption: my own biases we&#39;re around

00:07:42.109 --> 00:07:46.138
Caption: and I was

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.169
Caption: that I won&#39;t even be when we just and

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:50.190
Caption: understand

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:53.059
Caption: some of you who know me know that

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.059
Caption: suffering from PTSD

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:59.908
Caption: [Music]

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:01.919
Caption: the reason I say those things is there

00:07:59.908 --> 00:08:04.348
Caption: one other introverts and other people

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:07.229
Caption: who suffer from PTSD or anxiety to

00:08:04.348 --> 00:08:09.468
Caption: realize that doesn&#39;t have to be admitted

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:12.209
Caption: to store it

00:08:09.468 --> 00:08:15.239
Caption: it doesn&#39;t have to be the bias that you

00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:19.848
Caption: hold against yourself just stop you from

00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:19.848
Caption: taking actions and doing I

00:08:20.269 --> 00:08:25.729
Caption: had a fun game of internalized racism

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:33.049
Caption: what would happen growing up is I would

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:36.669
Caption: date an Asian guy and eating his name is

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.669
Caption: Jonathan it was terrible but

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.890
Caption: my father said to me you

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.840
Caption: [Music]

00:08:54.338 --> 00:09:00.020
Caption: can&#39;t date him he&#39;s patient

00:08:57.338 --> 00:09:01.599
Caption: my mom was sitting next to him she&#39;s

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.929
Caption: Chinese

00:09:01.599 --> 00:09:04.929
Caption: I&#39;m going

00:09:06.489 --> 00:09:13.000
Caption: and he said to me you know sending our

00:09:09.289 --> 00:09:13.000
Caption: genetic lineage backwards

00:09:14.109 --> 00:09:17.109
Caption: horrifying

00:09:20.528 --> 00:09:26.320
Caption: so here I&#39;m thinking

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.320
Caption: Asians

00:09:29.349 --> 00:09:35.419
Caption: so I admit that I took on board all of

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.930
Caption: these believes that comments made was

00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:37.929
Caption: less then

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:44.059
Caption: part of me wasn&#39;t worthy and

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.208
Caption: admittedly it made one hell of a lot

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:50.690
Caption: hotter

00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:53.179
Caption: hotter than most people would it meant

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.070
Caption: that I would create scenarios where I

00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:58.239
Caption: would become the most underestimated

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.239
Caption: person in the room

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.849
Caption: there is a power in being the most

00:10:01.429 --> 00:10:03.849
Caption: underestimated

00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:08.500
Caption: because what happens is you get to

00:10:07.369 --> 00:10:11.299
Caption: observe

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.840
Caption: you get to observe how others treat

00:10:11.299 --> 00:10:13.839
Caption: others

00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:21.769
Caption: the second thing was so the third thing

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:25.869
Caption: was that I have the last seven years

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:28.429
Caption: told myself I am completely in oil I

00:10:25.869 --> 00:10:30.589
Caption: run my own business that&#39;s been the

00:10:28.429 --> 00:10:34.279
Caption: story of you telling myself oddly enough

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:37.100
Caption: in the interview last week I got head

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:39.280
Caption: hunted for a job through minting kind of

00:10:37.099 --> 00:10:39.279
Caption: cool

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:46.090
Caption: not for me best interview I&#39;ve ever had

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:49.880
Caption: in my life

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:51.970
Caption: who when I get to be if I didn&#39;t hold on

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:55.179
Caption: to the story that

00:10:51.969 --> 00:10:55.179
Caption: I might

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:03.260
Caption: so all of these different biases play

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:05.539
Caption: out in how we approach life it&#39;s not

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:09.700
Caption: just about everybody else&#39;s last week

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:12.079
Caption: all have bias in one way shape or form

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.770
Caption: because we grow up with a certain

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.770
Caption: environment

00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:29.159
Caption: so

00:11:26.489 --> 00:11:33.099
Caption: now we know each of us

00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:34.229
Caption: so physical everybody cut yourself a

00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:37.268
Caption: break

00:11:34.229 --> 00:11:41.969
Caption: you cannot be held responsible for what

00:11:37.268 --> 00:11:41.969
Caption: happens between the ages of 0 &amp; 7 I

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.539
Caption: wasn&#39;t sure but I was a kid really

00:11:46.828 --> 00:11:51.549
Caption: so kind of something bright understand

00:11:49.539 --> 00:11:54.838
Caption: that these beliefs will form to the

00:11:51.549 --> 00:11:54.838
Caption: environment you have no

00:11:58.229 --> 00:12:02.458
Caption: second bringing awareness to your bias

00:12:01.568 --> 00:12:04.809
Caption: is

00:12:02.458 --> 00:12:08.450
Caption: sometimes true especially when it&#39;s

00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:12.378
Caption: unconscious it usually takes an event

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.379
Caption: [Music]

00:12:13.739 --> 00:12:22.750
Caption: but I will bring out our outrage

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:23.579
Caption: and what&#39;s important is to stop take a

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:29.008
Caption: break

00:12:23.578 --> 00:12:29.008
Caption: and we look at that bias what is that

00:12:31.018 --> 00:12:36.088
Caption: is that actually the situation that I&#39;m

00:12:33.578 --> 00:12:40.028
Caption: in right now or has it occurred before

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:41.818
Caption: because we met we build evidence over a

00:12:40.028 --> 00:12:44.619
Caption: long period of time

00:12:41.818 --> 00:12:47.818
Caption: that advice is true disposable

00:12:44.619 --> 00:12:47.818
Caption: confirmation bias which is

00:12:48.599 --> 00:12:53.818
Caption: we surround ourselves with people with

00:12:51.159 --> 00:12:57.989
Caption: like-minded beliefs and

00:12:53.818 --> 00:12:57.989
Caption: often don&#39;t challenge it

00:12:58.078 --> 00:13:05.500
Caption: the great relationships with people

00:13:02.518 --> 00:13:08.979
Caption: who will challenge your bias in a good

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.760
Caption: way I&#39;m so very lucky that I&#39;m

00:13:08.979 --> 00:13:13.549
Caption: surrounded incredible human beings

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:16.100
Caption: Michele is absolutely one of them who I

00:13:13.549 --> 00:13:18.169
Caption: will have my own challenges in something

00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:20.719
Caption: I&#39;ll have a conversation with her and

00:13:18.169 --> 00:13:26.239
Caption: when we have that conversation it is in

00:13:20.719 --> 00:13:27.859
Caption: a safe space I am never judged and we

00:13:26.239 --> 00:13:30.919
Caption: when you&#39;re working in your workplaces

00:13:27.859 --> 00:13:32.950
Caption: or working with your peers that is the

00:13:30.919 --> 00:13:35.630
Caption: importance of safe space

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:38.929
Caption: somebody might have a countering belief

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:40.929
Caption: to you that is challenging you cannot

00:13:38.929 --> 00:13:45.429
Caption: fit it in to them

00:13:40.929 --> 00:13:48.890
Caption: instead find out what their preferences

00:13:45.429 --> 00:13:50.080
Caption: so we often talk about the map is not

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.540
Caption: the territory

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:56.570
Caption: so when you look at Google Maps

00:13:52.539 --> 00:13:59.028
Caption: it&#39;s not the same as being on the corner

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.400
Caption: of that street seeing the people who are

00:13:59.028 --> 00:14:05.000
Caption: walking around

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:07.070
Caption: so we mapped our childhood every single

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.369
Caption: one of us in this room would have a

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:12.140

Caption: that landmark advice

00:14:16.838 --> 00:14:24.130

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.320
Caption: you&#39;re just on outcome rather than being

00:14:33.979 --> 00:14:37.778

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:58.090

00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:01.080

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:06.609

Caption: is it about this situation you can

00:15:06.609 --> 00:15:08.880
Caption: change

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:15.880

Caption: responsive

00:15:39.719 --> 00:15:44.099
Caption: because you just compensate

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:50.549
Caption: so my best way of managing these kind of

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.550
Caption: situations

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:57.519

Caption: what made you feel this bad

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.820

00:16:57.568 --> 00:17:03.719
Caption: because I don&#39;t know what to say

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:06.188
Caption: so they say that

00:17:03.719 --> 00:17:09.599
Caption: and it&#39;s taught me a tremendous amount

00:17:06.188 --> 00:17:11.489
Caption: of patience with people

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:14.979

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:41.070
