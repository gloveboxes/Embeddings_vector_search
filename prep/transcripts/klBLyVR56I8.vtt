00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:28.559
Caption: my talk hopefully you find it

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.899
Caption: interesting I wasn&#39;t sure if Frank

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:35.549
Caption: Andrews were got everyone as excited as

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.808
Caption: we get invited so here we go

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:38.878

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.639
Caption: for clarity so about 12 years ago a 12

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.980

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.440
Caption: taught you drilling and he came into the

00:00:56.398 --> 00:01:00.869
Caption: clinic that he had a 10 out of 10

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:01.558
Caption: headache the worst headache even that he

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:04.889
Caption: was vomiting

00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:07.408
Caption: they had no nausea at all physicians are

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:08.908
Caption: trained to treat this as a brain bleed

00:01:07.408 --> 00:01:12.269
Caption: until proven otherwise

00:01:08.908 --> 00:01:14.419
Caption: that&#39;s very serious we can see the image

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:17.758
Caption: in his brain but there&#39;s no bleed

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:20.158
Caption: instead was a brain tumor the size of a

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:56.758
Caption: worldwide and this fact is staggering

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.279
Caption: once you realize that it is a rare task

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.319
Caption: childhood leukemia make up the vast

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:02.849

Caption: close the amount of deaths from brain

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:07.739
Caption: dude there&#39;s lots of kinds of brain

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:11.069
Caption: tumor these are a homogeneous set of

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:12.839
Caption: diseases many subjects and they all have

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.339
Caption: they&#39;re all various degrees of

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.500
Caption: aggressiveness they respond differently

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:20.639
Caption: to different treatments so it could be

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.300
Caption: surgically affected some can&#39;t for

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:26.848
Caption: example the type of medulloblastoma

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.279
Caption: known as a wint paper glass dome ax has

00:02:26.848 --> 00:02:31.979
Caption: a malfunction in one of its pathways and

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:35.369
Caption: this causes a side effect that the

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:37.199
Caption: blood-brain barrier gets disrupted now

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:39.149
Caption: this is actually advantageous for

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:42.059
Caption: children with the wint type video about

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:44.579
Caption: stoma and what this means is that the

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:48.029
Caption: compromised blood brain barrier actually

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.500
Caption: allows more chemotherapy agents to cross

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:52.589
Caption: the blood-brain barrier and get the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.479
Caption: tuner which is why wint tumors have a

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:56.399
Caption: better prognosis than children in the

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.559
Caption: state group 3 which is of the same

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.970
Caption: possum module up though with different

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.798
Caption: types of treatments very different

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.979
Caption: tumors subtypes are important to keep

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:07.789
Caption: they don&#39;t develop so how do we tell the

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:10.649
Caption: difference between these types of tumor

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:13.110
Caption: well for some cancer let&#39;s say you had

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:14.399
Caption: skin cancer melanoma or breast cancer it

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.139
Caption: can be very obvious you can look out

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:17.789
Caption: under a microscope they&#39;ll have

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.399
Caption: different morphologies they look very

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:24.029
Caption: different but for brain tumors this can

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:26.939
Caption: be problematic medulloblastomas under

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:29.238
Caption: the microscope but identical upon us

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.738
Caption: fellow you can&#39;t tell it it

00:03:29.238 --> 00:03:33.660
Caption: traditionally the way these tumors have

00:03:31.738 --> 00:03:36.208
Caption: been distinguished it&#39;s been where are

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.949
Caption: they in the brain so if you had a tumor

00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:39.328
Caption: growing on the pineal gland with a

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.098
Caption: picture here I don&#39;t what they want to

00:03:39.328 --> 00:03:44.759
Caption: have perfect neuroanatomy mind but great

00:03:41.098 --> 00:03:46.500
Caption: everything was the same then they say oh

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.268
Caption: it&#39;s on the pineal gland it&#39;s up on

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.559
Caption: elastomer

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:52.199
Caption: but this can be a problematic way to

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:54.119
Caption: diagnose frankly for example this image

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.309
Caption: here taken from the UCLA neurosurgery

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:58.500
Caption: page from the pine box don&#39;t age there&#39;s

00:03:56.309 --> 00:04:01.619
Caption: a great resource of information to

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.298
Caption: patients but there&#39;s a little subtypes

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:05.578
Caption: under this image that says after they

00:04:03.298 --> 00:04:07.738
Caption: were second the tumor and analyzed it it

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:11.059
Caption: ended up actually being as well last

00:04:07.738 --> 00:04:14.578
Caption: moment it wasn&#39;t funny above the little

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:15.809
Caption: so how do we diagnose the subject how do

00:04:14.578 --> 00:04:18.208
Caption: we figure out which treatments are gonna

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:19.769
Caption: work well there&#39;s two groups in the

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.239
Caption: world that kind of do it the best with

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.240
Caption: one in New York New York and one in

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.220
Caption: Heidelberg Germany now most people use

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:28.049
Caption: Germany it is the gold

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.149
Caption: the one that everyone they do it the

00:04:28.049 --> 00:04:32.789
Caption: best they have the most robust algorithm

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:35.070
Caption: it&#39;s a secret but it&#39;s considered the

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.619
Caption: best so a patient comes in to Perth

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.550
Caption: Perth Children&#39;s Hospital with a brain

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:45.690
Caption: tumor cut on a bio freeze it send it to

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:47.099
Caption: Heidelberg Holabird then runs some tests

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.160
Caption: on it they use what&#39;s called a DNA

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.209
Caption: methylation array DNA methylation you

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.040
Caption: might have heard about it those

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:55.199
Caption: epigenetics is a big buzzword these days

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.670
Caption: trading genes on and off but it can also

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.010
Caption: act with just a fingerprint a

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.080
Caption: fingerprint in your genome which can be

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.670
Caption: associating different paper to and they

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:04.919
Caption: have a black box other than that and

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.440
Caption: look at this profile tell you what it is

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.029
Caption: so once they finish analyzing it they&#39;re

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.100
Caption: right at the report they look at the

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.869
Caption: histology is welding a little slice they

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.820
Caption: send that back to Perth where we were

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:19.919
Caption: like ah ok this is what big fat now this

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.070
Caption: can be problematic because that can take

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:25.830
Caption: time and sometimes you have to start

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.589
Caption: treatment but for a couple weeks pops

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:30.149
Caption: when you get a diagnosis and if you have

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:33.359
Caption: to start treatment before you know what

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:34.679
Caption: the tumor is why even bother diagnosing

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:37.859
Caption: it it&#39;s not going to affect your

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:40.169
Caption: treatment plan it doesn&#39;t change it now

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:42.000
Caption: for other nations or maybe our poster to

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.330
Caption: Germany there are other problems that

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.100
Caption: this presents as well one is cost not

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:49.859
Caption: every country can afford this ship

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.330
Caption: samples to Germany back now parts

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:53.459
Caption: Children&#39;s Hospital to see you guys know

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:55.529
Caption: does have a special deal with Idol birth

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:57.479
Caption: we get it stripped our sample free in

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:59.160
Caption: exchange they get to keep the patient

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.820
Caption: data and they build it over them it gets

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.450
Caption: better and better

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:06.479
Caption: so we&#39;re trading our data for free now

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:09.419
Caption: it&#39;s not every country can do this some

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.669
Caption: countries have laws that prohibit black

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.380
Caption: box diagnosed so like Sweden for example

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.450
Caption: can&#39;t use Heidelberg even though they&#39;re

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.010
Caption: close by so the system their health care

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.500
Caption: system does not allow them to be like

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:26.400
Caption: here take these medications I can&#39;t tell

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:28.709
Caption: you why you got a static so I almost

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:31.619
Caption: find myself sort of teetering here

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:34.259
Caption: between a Bennett developer for the last

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:36.119
Caption: 20 years I&#39;ve also been in oncology for

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.740
Caption: the last eight there&#39;s always a little

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:40.660
Caption: sliver here I can sort of help you know

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:43.099
Caption: also an Xbox players a little bit

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.839
Caption: and I think like many of you in here who

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.149
Caption: are technologists who are developers

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:49.100
Caption: engineers you look at problems

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:51.019
Caption: differently right you kind of look at

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.809
Caption: them and we&#39;re like how can you solve it

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:55.699
Caption: and so I&#39;m a colleague of mine dr.

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:57.470
Caption: Melvin chin and sit beside me picture

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:02.090
Caption: here thinking please don&#39;t put me in

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:04.399
Caption: your powerpoint he calls me a solution

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:06.139
Caption: Asst he says that I go when I solve

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:08.720
Caption: problems just for the sake of solving it

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.730
Caption: even when the problems not that bad but

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.500
Caption: a solution takes so much longer than the

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:16.040
Caption: problem positives begin with and he&#39;s

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:18.049
Caption: not entirely wrong but sometimes in my

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.940
Caption: past I have hit some healthcare problem

00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:21.500
Caption: solve all the technology and they

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.000
Caption: believe those project behind for the

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.459
Caption: solution other people consult

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.049
Caption: so obviously this time around I&#39;m like

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:28.940
Caption: all right I&#39;ve gotta be attacked love is

00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:32.119
Caption: something that you do to solve this

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.459
Caption: problem and it wasn&#39;t a long time it was

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:36.049
Caption: a group in Sweden who I brought up that

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:37.729
Caption: they had the issue that they&#39;re not

00:07:36.049 --> 00:07:40.849
Caption: allowed to you thought over here in

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:43.010
Caption: Perth I&#39;m concerned to the time but

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.350
Caption: group led the hell enough Crellin who

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.300
Caption: has a brain tumor group in Gothenburg

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:50.029
Caption: Sweden and one of her postdocs Ahamed

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:53.149
Caption: we&#39;ve set up front fault and it had to

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:53.959
Caption: accomplish three paths the first had to

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:55.729
Caption: be cheap

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:57.229
Caption: it had to be cheaper than sending your

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:59.419
Caption: samples of hydaburg it had to be

00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:01.000
Caption: affordable enough that a hospital budget

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:03.010
Caption: wasn&#39;t going to break but implement ease

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.700
Caption: it had to be easy

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.040
Caption: pathologists aren&#39;t going to have the

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.630
Caption: ability to take on bioinformatics skills

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.070
Caption: they&#39;re not going to have the budgets of

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:13.429
Caption: pathology department to hire additional

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:16.130
Caption: expertise and lastly had to be accurate

00:08:13.429 --> 00:08:18.019
Caption: we knew going in there was no way we&#39;re

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:20.000
Caption: going to develop something as robust as

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:21.349
Caption: the Heidelberg algorithm we knew we

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.570
Caption: weren&#39;t gonna Ford to spend up to

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:26.809
Caption: hundred cords and run neural networks on

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:28.610
Caption: training set not here half but at the

00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:32.330
Caption: output the result was just as accurate

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:34.760
Caption: or better than it doesn&#39;t matter so

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:37.070
Caption: first we started by collecting samples

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.750
Caption: from the gene expression omnibus just

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.799
Caption: this online repository of all the

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.710
Caption: genetic information

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:46.399
Caption: there&#39;s RNA arrays DNA analysis snip

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:48.170
Caption: that up and also DNA methylation data so

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.150
Caption: Mohammed went through it all clean it up

00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:52.729
Caption: costing between values at the end of the

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.350
Caption: day was able to find 472 PDF

00:08:52.729 --> 00:08:57.138
Caption: bring to the samples and database of

00:08:54.349 --> 00:09:00.349
Caption: that nine of those different nine for to

00:08:57.138 --> 00:09:02.659
Caption: a sofa then using basic kind of linear

00:09:00.349 --> 00:09:05.898
Caption: regression modeling ROC curves we cut

00:09:02.659 --> 00:09:08.359
Caption: down those 450k arrays as 450,000 bro of

00:09:05.898 --> 00:09:09.528
Caption: Rome to a nine hundred probe pool that

00:09:08.359 --> 00:09:11.570
Caption: we were able to end to make finger

00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:13.909
Caption: prints out of and that became our

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:16.278
Caption: training data set those four hundred

00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:19.309
Caption: seventy two two hundred nine hundred pro

00:09:16.278 --> 00:09:22.278
Caption: tool again what we use and we&#39;ve decided

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:24.078
Caption: to make a multi class random forests of

00:09:22.278 --> 00:09:25.578
Caption: it and so this part I&#39;m going to get a

00:09:24.078 --> 00:09:27.138
Caption: little bit more than details just so if

00:09:25.578 --> 00:09:28.369
Caption: anyone&#39;s interested especially alert and

00:09:27.138 --> 00:09:33.018
Caption: new to modeling maybe can take something

00:09:28.369 --> 00:09:35.328
Caption: out of this so the training set fees are

00:09:33.018 --> 00:09:37.278
Caption: not going to approach and from that we

00:09:35.328 --> 00:09:39.619
Caption: break out into classifiers that n number

00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:42.320
Caption: of hot parts each tumor subtype has

00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:44.088
Caption: multiple clock parts not this one then

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.699
Caption: you take the DNA methylation data from

00:09:44.088 --> 00:09:48.859
Caption: your unknown tunic mutation you run this

00:09:46.698 --> 00:09:50.750
Caption: through all the pot part it&#39;s going to

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:53.570
Caption: match to each one who are very consented

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.919
Caption: if it is really a pining of us Belmont

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.018
Caption: it&#39;s only going to match to a many

00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:58.518
Caption: little fingerprint by like making but it

00:09:57.018 --> 00:10:00.349
Caption: matches really tight with a piney with

00:09:58.518 --> 00:10:02.208
Caption: ninety-three that&#39;s a better match then

00:10:00.349 --> 00:10:04.880
Caption: you add all those pots powers up the end

00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:06.469
Caption: and you get a prediction with a certain

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.448
Caption: percent confidence into ball of what to

00:10:06.469 --> 00:10:09.679
Caption: Murray

00:10:07.448 --> 00:10:12.049
Caption: now this whole thing is done to random

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:13.489
Caption: forests that you&#39;re not nor an enormous

00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:15.018
Caption: some of you might be some of you might

00:10:13.489 --> 00:10:18.919
Caption: not be it&#39;s a way of removing

00:10:15.018 --> 00:10:20.028
Caption: instability from regression trees so if

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:21.559
Caption: anyone&#39;s ever played with any kind of

00:10:20.028 --> 00:10:23.539
Caption: regression trees it&#39;s done just see them

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:25.130
Caption: in general flowchart that first branch

00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:27.469
Caption: rate that first one we decide which way

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:29.028
Caption: to go can be critical because all these

00:10:27.469 --> 00:10:30.948
Caption: downstream branches so that first

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:33.859
Caption: division can change how everything ends

00:10:30.948 --> 00:10:36.289
Caption: up and that first division is really

00:10:33.859 --> 00:10:37.398
Caption: sensitive to your training set your data

00:10:36.289 --> 00:10:38.929
Caption: is a little different when you start

00:10:37.398 --> 00:10:39.919
Caption: that first division GUI different you

00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:42.559
Caption: may get a different answer

00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:44.809
Caption: so what a rainforest is it takes you

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:46.989
Caption: gotta set your training set randomly

00:10:44.809 --> 00:10:49.190
Caption: deletes one third of it generates a tree

00:10:46.989 --> 00:10:51.648
Caption: delete it Brantly delete another 130

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:53.778
Caption: tree another third tree tree tree until

00:10:51.648 --> 00:10:55.969
Caption: you have a whole mystery 0 horse and as

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:58.398
Caption: our end apart and so we&#39;ve run this

00:10:55.969 --> 00:11:00.588
Caption: tumor data through the forest then add

00:10:58.398 --> 00:11:02.479
Caption: up all that at the end and never move

00:11:00.588 --> 00:11:04.938
Caption: that instability that&#39;s inherent for

00:11:02.479 --> 00:11:06.469
Caption: aggressors we call this whole system

00:11:04.939 --> 00:11:09.050
Caption: meth pet

00:11:06.469 --> 00:11:11.119
Caption: methylation the other go that&#39;s a little

00:11:09.049 --> 00:11:14.899
Caption: packets a nice little setup kind of way

00:11:11.119 --> 00:11:17.479
Caption: and this solves that first one cost this

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.400
Caption: is a very cheap other than the run once

00:11:17.479 --> 00:11:22.130
Caption: the hard work is done you can run it on

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.330
Caption: your work computer MacBook Pro ace there

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:27.440
Caption: it doesn&#39;t matter you don&#39;t need a lot

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:30.500
Caption: of cores it&#39;s cheap but not very easy to

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.880
Caption: use so the last year on my weekends and

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.890
Caption: some spare time because I&#39;m actually do

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:37.640
Caption: lung cancer work normally when a job was

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.720
Caption: just aside puffle as it were

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.580
Caption: I&#39;ve been working to try to make this

00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:42.589
Caption: more easier for pathologist to use or I

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.910
Caption: start with methylation data you get

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:47.120
Caption: right from the machine the DNA in the

00:11:43.909 --> 00:11:48.829
Caption: collection race normally you put this

00:11:47.119 --> 00:11:51.830
Caption: into genome studio this is what we did

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:54.170
Caption: for the first training set data but this

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.520
Caption: is a funky piece of software people hate

00:11:54.169 --> 00:11:57.619
Caption: it even by our petitions get in

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.119
Caption: normalize the data get out do it in Part

00:11:57.619 --> 00:12:02.330
Caption: F do it in our get out of this things

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:03.529
Caption: back again pathologist we&#39;re not going

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.450
Caption: to want to open this up and because we

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.610
Caption: different software packages luckily the

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:11.510
Caption: solution to this was solved many years

00:12:07.609 --> 00:12:14.359
Caption: ago by Hansen 2011 he reverse engineered

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:16.549
Caption: the Illumina normalization set it&#39;s a

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:20.059
Caption: built his logarithm into our software

00:12:16.549 --> 00:12:23.119
Caption: and then I pre bundled all the manifest

00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:24.739
Caption: data that health healthy array what&#39;s on

00:12:23.119 --> 00:12:25.880
Caption: the chip world the probes are this is

00:12:24.739 --> 00:12:27.349
Caption: something we just did because they

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.390
Caption: didn&#39;t want the software to have to

00:12:27.349 --> 00:12:30.979
Caption: connect the Internet we didn&#39;t want some

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.350
Caption: pathology department talked computers

00:12:30.979 --> 00:12:34.760
Caption: and hospitals can&#39;t just connect through

00:12:33.349 --> 00:12:37.159
Caption: an open API there&#39;s a lot of ports that

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.869
Caption: are blocked a lot of patient data that

00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:42.529
Caption: sensitive so we bundled all those

00:12:38.869 --> 00:12:43.010
Caption: manifests in then we use an open package

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.590
Caption: called

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.970
Caption: minify we just open up bioconductor it&#39;s

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.830
Caption: a bunch of tools that allow you to

00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:50.779
Caption: manipulate DNA methylation data really

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.670
Caption: easily and I use that they calculate

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.320
Caption: these intensity differences value and

00:12:52.669 --> 00:12:56.179
Caption: then because we&#39;re all kind of like

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.919
Caption: dirty hackers I just toss that junk into

00:12:56.179 --> 00:13:01.219
Caption: like a matrix and then shove that matrix

00:12:57.919 --> 00:13:02.750
Caption: in the bath bed and then this whole

00:13:01.219 --> 00:13:07.519
Caption: process this pipeline

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:08.659
Caption: I call this methyl DX then I&#39;m not

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.400
Caption: committed to the name yet if you guys

00:13:08.659 --> 00:13:12.289
Caption: have better ideas come bug me at lunch

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.130
Caption: maybe something with a pun and it would

00:13:12.289 --> 00:13:19.659
Caption: be really good I like puns this would be

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:22.510
Caption: run on any computer it&#39;s really simple

00:13:19.659 --> 00:13:24.789
Caption: drag the intensity data file from the

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:27.640
Caption: array on to this and it spits out a

00:13:24.789 --> 00:13:28.989
Caption: diagnosis to the conference so now we

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.109
Caption: have the first tip we have it&#39;s cheap

00:13:28.989 --> 00:13:33.940
Caption: now it&#39;s easy to use but is it accurate

00:13:32.109 --> 00:13:36.429
Caption: give me the wrong diagnosis it&#39;s pretty

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.780
Caption: much Jesus and so this comes from our

00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:39.159
Caption: validation step and this might be one

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.450
Caption: cool thing you guys can take away from

00:13:39.159 --> 00:13:42.459
Caption: this talk you&#39;re not familiar with the

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.609
Caption: tripod statement or you&#39;re doing any

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.200
Caption: kind of modeling at all rarely recommend

00:13:45.609 --> 00:13:48.909
Caption: that you check us out this is being

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.750
Caption: really pushed hard by Andrew Dekker if

00:13:48.909 --> 00:13:52.259
Caption: you&#39;re familiar with his work and

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.280
Caption: modeling which one tastes pet projects

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.619
Caption: basically their types of validation

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.050
Caption: steps one being like the least valid

00:13:56.619 --> 00:14:00.099
Caption: type for studies be the most valid I&#39;ll

00:13:59.049 --> 00:14:02.799
Caption: let you go to the website and resolve

00:14:00.099 --> 00:14:04.389
Caption: through this flow chart but basically we

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:06.729
Caption: were only able to do one hours of type

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.429
Caption: two and we didn&#39;t have access to a lot

00:14:06.729 --> 00:14:11.070
Caption: of tumors as I previously mentioned

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:13.479
Caption: Franklin redirection is quite rare and

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.010
Caption: so what Helena was doing with her team

00:14:13.479 --> 00:14:16.599
Caption: is Sweden with she&#39;s reaching out to all

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.400
Caption: his position friends all across Europe

00:14:16.599 --> 00:14:20.469
Caption: trying to get more to the edge of

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.480
Caption: regularization and so she was doing that

00:14:20.469 --> 00:14:25.299
Caption: for last year while I was doing the

00:14:22.479 --> 00:14:27.760
Caption: methyl DX the last year I came over but

00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:29.919
Caption: then I accidentally stumbled on the

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.780
Caption: summer so my former boss the telephone

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:34.329
Caption: kids who&#39;s now at Perth Children&#39;s

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:37.030
Caption: Hospital who take for Tahoe over his

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:39.790
Caption: career he&#39;s had you know fifteen or

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:42.460
Caption: sixteen brain to be 12 of those

00:14:39.789 --> 00:14:44.440
Caption: he sent samples of Heidelberg they were

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.630
Caption: not in the original gene omnibus

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.720
Caption: training data and he just had that done

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:51.070
Caption: so I was able to take parts isolations

00:14:49.719 --> 00:14:54.069
Caption: being so assembler from the rest of the

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:56.380
Caption: world and use that to validate our study

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:59.049
Caption: and jump ahead and conduct a type 4

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.419
Caption: validation study now I&#39;m not gonna get

00:14:59.049 --> 00:15:03.309
Caption: into some of the crazy maps involved the

00:15:01.419 --> 00:15:05.109
Caption: statistics of comparing datasets back

00:15:03.309 --> 00:15:07.630
Caption: and forth but I&#39;ll just talk to you a

00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:11.049
Caption: little quickly about what the results

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:13.419
Caption: kind of were and some interesting issues

00:15:11.049 --> 00:15:14.649
Caption: were comparing datasets comparing

00:15:13.419 --> 00:15:15.519
Caption: results and maybe we can cover this more

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.630
Caption: or less and wants to talk to me

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.100
Caption: especially people who have a more

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.739
Caption: statistical backgrounds that kind of

00:15:18.099 --> 00:15:23.469
Caption: thing but I&#39;d love to hear does so we

00:15:20.739 --> 00:15:26.529
Caption: get our 12 tumors and one thing to

00:15:23.469 --> 00:15:28.899
Caption: understand is that the official endgame

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:31.800
Caption: diagnosis one thing is written in the

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.580
Caption: charts is whatever path West says it is

00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:35.289
Caption: they became the goal

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.630
Caption: centers for what I was going to care

00:15:35.289 --> 00:15:39.909
Caption: about it now path West has access to

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.220
Caption: patient histories family history of type

00:15:39.909 --> 00:15:44.349
Caption: of cancer they know that has blood tests

00:15:42.219 --> 00:15:46.089
Caption: that have CT scans that have the

00:15:44.349 --> 00:15:49.299
Caption: biopsies with histology to pathology

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:53.080
Caption: they have access to all the data you can

00:15:49.299 --> 00:15:54.399
Caption: imagine make a final decision so the

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.890
Caption: doctors do send those samples the

00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:00.640
Caption: Heidelberg Heidelberg only gets two

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:04.390
Caption: things one sample the histology and they

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:07.450
Caption: get to run the methylation better they

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:09.549
Caption: don&#39;t get all that a scam but path West

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.840
Caption: does get Heidelberg report back now

00:16:09.549 --> 00:16:13.029
Caption: let&#39;s get a little muddy in the water

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.210
Caption: half the West makes the final decision

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:18.940
Caption: after reading what other more sensitive

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:20.980
Caption: so you have a great ball but you compare

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:24.099
Caption: Heidelberg is what past West finally

00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:27.000
Caption: decided I will burn agreed with half

00:16:24.099 --> 00:16:29.529
Caption: west and as 12 times so 83% of the time

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.679
Caption: Heidelberg is getting it right in the

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:35.590
Caption: eyes of pathway when you compare that

00:16:32.679 --> 00:16:37.059
Caption: mesfet our algorithm it&#39;s a little bit

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.490
Caption: different it&#39;s still kind of interesting

00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:42.159
Caption: so for the first tumor for example to

00:16:39.489 --> 00:16:44.429
Caption: remember one Heidelberg got it wrong but

00:16:42.159 --> 00:16:46.899
Caption: meth-head got it right yay

00:16:44.429 --> 00:16:48.460
Caption: unfortunately for tumor number 10 how

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:52.330
Caption: the boy got it right that&#39;s had two

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:54.280
Caption: daughters raw who well instinct thing

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:57.070
Caption: that came out of it was this tumor here

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.900
Caption: tumor before to River for was a really

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:00.429
Caption: weird-looking tumor it was sort of a

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.100
Caption: hybrid of other kinds of tumors and

00:17:00.429 --> 00:17:05.050
Caption: looked like a mixture and how to bird

00:17:03.099 --> 00:17:07.479
Caption: confidently said I know what that end

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:10.180
Caption: here&#39;s one of it path West experts like

00:17:07.479 --> 00:17:12.160
Caption: now you&#39;re at the ledger crazy meanwhile

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:16.209
Caption: the way I tweaked the confidence

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:18.130
Caption: interval how I said that should agree to

00:17:16.208 --> 00:17:20.530
Caption: tell me what something is and how

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:23.739
Caption: confident was for this validation study

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.510
Caption: but set to a way where it said I&#39;m look

00:17:23.739 --> 00:17:27.640
Caption: at this tumor kind of 36 percent of the

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:29.410
Caption: you know Matt&#39;s 36 percent and how

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.560
Caption: there&#39;s other tumor like twenty eight

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:34.330
Caption: percent but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m not going

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.040
Caption: to tell you what it is because I&#39;m not

00:17:34.329 --> 00:17:40.989
Caption: probably enough to make a prediction and

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:43.810
Caption: it said so in that respect I think

00:17:40.989 --> 00:17:46.390
Caption: that&#39;s a promise a good mark for met pet

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.470
Caption: remember Matt pet only has the DNA

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.270
Caption: methylation data

00:17:47.469 --> 00:17:51.099
Caption: it doesn&#39;t have installed these

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:53.320
Caption: predictions are purely unbiased on the

00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:54.699
Caption: data set there&#39;s no human bias add the

00:17:53.319 --> 00:17:57.579
Caption: bevel condemning scope which could be

00:17:54.699 --> 00:18:00.579
Caption: pros and cons only maybe stuff then want

00:17:57.579 --> 00:18:04.359
Caption: to chat war if you are answer just

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:05.199
Caption: running at a time but like I said if

00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:07.510
Caption: anyone wants a chat with me about

00:18:05.199 --> 00:18:10.089
Caption: machine learning the algorithms of a

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.469
Caption: cancer I love a chat about it this is

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:13.599
Caption: comply me because I can talk about it

00:18:11.469 --> 00:18:16.179
Caption: forever when you grab a drink as a

00:18:13.599 --> 00:18:18.219
Caption: little party and hang out talk more I do

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.550
Caption: want to thank all these supercomputing

00:18:18.219 --> 00:18:23.260
Caption: for flying some support for this project

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.640
Caption: it&#39;s growing government and my actual

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.520
Caption: where I work in epicenter first but

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.869
Caption: diseases forgive me the time encouraged

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:40.300
Caption: me to pursue the side pocket can

00:18:28.869 --> 00:18:42.699
Caption: counselor and then let me come here we

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:46.080
Caption: have a few minutes the questions does

00:18:42.699 --> 00:18:46.079
Caption: anyone have any questions the wise

00:18:52.069 --> 00:18:57.758
Caption: Allah how the question was how do you

00:18:55.189 --> 00:19:00.888
Caption: use the supercomputer at Molesey

00:18:57.759 --> 00:19:02.710
Caption: physically but I think what you mean is

00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:06.559
Caption: what are we doing with us

00:19:02.709 --> 00:19:09.408
Caption: right so the actual validation steps of

00:19:06.558 --> 00:19:11.119
Caption: comparing the stat and comparing a lot

00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:14.479
Caption: of the values and devaluing our values

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:17.539
Caption: the r-squared and determining use a

00:19:14.479 --> 00:19:19.399
Caption: mixed model analysis to figure out how

00:19:17.538 --> 00:19:22.038
Caption: good we are predicting models that

00:19:19.399 --> 00:19:35.539
Caption: validation map we&#39;re doing that on

00:19:22.038 --> 00:19:39.888
Caption: magnet we didn&#39;t you know probably like

00:19:35.538 --> 00:19:41.388
Caption: an an SDN at one point but the tweaking

00:19:39.889 --> 00:19:42.950
Caption: that they going back and forth it&#39;s not

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:44.869
Caption: like you know varela so when we go back

00:19:42.949 --> 00:19:46.579
Caption: from our training set back to our output

00:19:44.869 --> 00:19:48.259
Caption: right and you go back your cranks and

00:19:46.579 --> 00:19:50.418
Caption: you going to get the right values here

00:19:48.259 --> 00:19:52.369
Caption: completing the numbers those the the

00:19:50.418 --> 00:19:55.248
Caption: spaces between the bars the SDN became

00:19:52.369 --> 00:19:57.950
Caption: so picky that we end up massively

00:19:55.249 --> 00:20:01.479
Caption: overfitting and we were like you know

00:19:57.949 --> 00:20:01.479
Caption: this is not the approach here for us

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.330
Caption: yeah that was sort of we see some

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.910
Caption: literature and some other models we kind

00:20:12.329 --> 00:20:16.439
Caption: of home-brewed our own sort of scripts

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:19.290
Caption: bring them back and to get in touch with

00:20:16.439 --> 00:20:25.969
Caption: folks with value vector we didn&#39;t use

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:25.970
Caption: library time for one ball

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.780
Caption: it&#39;s a great it&#39;s a great mix and that&#39;s

00:20:33.589 --> 00:20:37.788
Caption: something wrong reasons why we kept

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.650
Caption: doing it you know it&#39;s all volunteer

00:20:37.788 --> 00:20:43.459
Caption: work it&#39;s a lot of fun

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:45.530
Caption: I forget cause the public fun so a lot

00:20:43.459 --> 00:20:49.089
Caption: of the late methylation data

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:51.679
Caption: manipulations done in are all all the

00:20:49.089 --> 00:20:54.260
Caption: front-end stuff is done in Java

00:20:51.678 --> 00:20:55.428
Caption: one of the most multi platform which is

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.409
Caption: easy way for us to do that and both

00:20:55.428 --> 00:21:01.038
Caption: familiar with from doing Android apps

00:20:57.409 --> 00:21:04.159
Caption: anyway and then we fun with server-side

00:21:01.038 --> 00:21:05.389
Caption: stuff entirely but one of the things

00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:08.350
Caption: we&#39;re trying to do if we can find a host

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:10.190
Caption: I want to put another data of it online

00:21:08.349 --> 00:21:14.510
Caption: and then find some of the hook that&#39;s

00:21:10.189 --> 00:21:15.829
Caption: free just to get people interested and

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:18.500
Caption: pathologist&#39;s if you&#39;ve been playing

00:21:15.829 --> 00:21:19.880
Caption: with it because one of the barriers to

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.798
Caption: access is getting into all the hospital

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.209
Caption: being do the proof run software and we

00:21:21.798 --> 00:21:24.979
Caption: can get pathologist to play it that like

00:21:23.209 --> 00:21:31.260
Caption: it then they can make a pitch to their

00:21:24.979 --> 00:21:34.619
Caption: hospitals that a week thanks again West

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.619
Caption: [Applause]
