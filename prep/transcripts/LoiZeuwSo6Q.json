  "description": "You\u0027ve seen seen people talking about it, even had friends doing it, but is remote working really as good as they say it is?\\n\\nIn August 2018 I took the plunge and discovered developer nirvana, a re-invigorated soul, and a desire to never work in open-plan offices ever again.\\n\\nIn this talk I\u0027ll share my experiences working 100% remotely for a company in a different time zone.  I\u0027ll cover the techniques and the tech I use (both hardware and software), the challenges I face, and the peace I have found.\\n\\nThis talk is for introverts who struggle in their current work situation, for developers desperate to get work done, and for people wanting to level-up at communicating.\\n\\nCarl believes anyone can do anything and lives by this philosophy.  He believes pigeon holes serve only as convenient labels, not unsurpassable boundaries. \\n\\nCarl values patterns and practices across multiple disciplines.  His thirst for knowledge and experience is insatiable.  When challenges arise he brings an endless stream of ideas to bear. \\n\\nCarl thinks with empathy and critically, and is effective as a designer and as a software engineer.  His leadership style is to share knowledge and to teach by doing.  He achieves goals on his own or in a group.\\n\\nHis side projects include constructing tiny houses and building computer games."
