00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:16.319
Caption: hi i&#39;m andy dent i&#39;d like to start by

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:18.959
Caption: thanking our sponsors

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:21.198
Caption: i&#39;m here to talk to you about

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:22.559
Caption: lottie and tooling around the lotte

00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:24.799
Caption: ecosystem

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:26.879
Caption: lottie is an animation format that as

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:29.278
Caption: you can see from this professional scale

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:30.879
Caption: diagram is a lot smaller than some of

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:34.319
Caption: the ways you may be putting animated

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:36.558
Caption: items on your web pages

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:37.840
Caption: if you attended my talk in 2019 or if

00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:40.000
Caption: you want to go back and look it up on

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.238
Caption: youtube i talked a lot about disney&#39;s

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.520
Caption: principles of animation and these first

00:00:42.238 --> 00:00:46.000
Caption: few slides

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.479
Caption: relate back to that talk as well i still

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.959
Caption: break down animation into three reasons

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.878
Caption: why so the first one is just to amuse

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:54.479
Caption: yourself or your user

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.760
Caption: to give them a little bit of delight in

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.439
Caption: the app and the user interface

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:01.119
Caption: sometimes you want to distract people

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:03.840
Caption: how long does it take to load something

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.279
Caption: so it&#39;s your classic loading spinner

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.040
Caption: or when you&#39;re getting started if you

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:08.959
Caption: have an app that unfortunately takes a

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.199
Caption: long time to get going

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:13.199
Caption: or talking of getting going you may want

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:15.839
Caption: to be informing them about the

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:17.839
Caption: onboarding process or just have a button

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:20.000
Caption: like this hamburger menu here that

00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:23.438
Caption: animates to provide a hint as to maybe

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.158
Caption: where they should be looking next

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.920
Caption: so let&#39;s talk about lottie lottie is a

00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:30.239
Caption: great open source project it&#39;s one of

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:32.000
Caption: those big success stories partly because

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:34.399
Caption: it comes out of companies with deep

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.199
Caption: pockets and a real need so it started

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.360
Caption: out as a web exporter for adobe after

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:41.839
Caption: effects after effects which some of you

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.599
Caption: may be familiar with is the big product

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:46.158
Caption: in motion design

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:48.720
Caption: and somebody wanted to have that out to

00:01:46.158 --> 00:01:51.758
Caption: a web player and fortunately for us they

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.000
Caption: built an intermediate format using json

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.200
Caption: airbnb uses so much on their website

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.599
Caption: they wanted to put it inside their

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:58.718
Caption: native apps so they built some really

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.639
Caption: cool

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.119
Caption: native libraries that are amongst the

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:05.519
Caption: best of breed in how to do graphic

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.119
Caption: rendering of vector graphics and release

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:09.440
Caption: those as un

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.440
Caption: encumbered open source

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.279
Caption: this has become quite an ecosystem so

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.360
Caption: i&#39;m going to talk about alternatives to

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:18.238
Caption: adobe&#39;s product

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.680
Caption: key shape flow and synfig there are also

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:23.119
Caption: other products because this is a simple

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:27.598
Caption: format to export to even the venerable

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:30.479
Caption: 3d blender has got a lotty plugin

00:02:27.598 --> 00:02:32.720
Caption: so why does text matter

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.399
Caption: text is a great intermediate format

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.160
Caption: anybody who&#39;s ever been in a complex

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:38.720
Caption: tool chain and had to wrestle with a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.639
Caption: binary format knows you don&#39;t want that

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.878
Caption: in particular if you are dealing with

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:45.039
Caption: version control text allows your version

00:02:42.878 --> 00:02:48.319
Caption: control system to operate really

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:50.719
Caption: efficiently and if you need to chase up

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.319
Caption: weird differences in behavior the last

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.958
Caption: thing you want to do is be doing a

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.039
Caption: visual comparison of two different

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.559
Caption: visual rendering side by side when it

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.799
Caption: might come down to a few characters

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.919
Caption: difference in text files you can diff by

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.598
Caption: hand

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.199
Caption: and sometimes you just need to tweak the

00:03:03.598 --> 00:03:07.598
Caption: color because somebody changed their

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:09.039
Caption: mind about the color blue and you need

00:03:07.598 --> 00:03:10.238
Caption: to go through and do a global search and

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.479
Caption: replace

00:03:10.238 --> 00:03:14.479
Caption: if you have a visual editing tool that

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.919
Caption: does styles that&#39;s easy if you have one

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:17.839
Caption: which requires you to go and hand edit

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.598
Caption: it in 32 different places it&#39;s a

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:22.080
Caption: nightmare

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:24.958
Caption: you can see here the little hamburger

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.958
Caption: lottie and an idea of what lottie jason

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:31.319
Caption: looks like there&#39;s about 100 lines of

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:31.319
Caption: this stuff here for that shape

00:03:32.158 --> 00:03:37.039
Caption: lottie files is the dominant site for

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:39.199
Caption: downloads you may be in normal icons

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:41.119
Caption: used to having a plethora of sites where

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.759
Caption: you can get the icons and

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:45.679
Caption: be their pngs or svgs in the lotte world

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:49.598
Caption: lottie files is pretty much it and has

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:49.598
Caption: grown into a commercial marketplace

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:54.958
Caption: so let&#39;s go over and have a look at

00:03:52.238 --> 00:03:54.958
Caption: lottie files

00:03:55.119 --> 00:04:01.438
Caption: oops sorry i shall bring up the lottie

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.839
Caption: files site that i opened earlier just to

00:04:01.438 --> 00:04:06.720
Caption: save it taking a while

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:08.878
Caption: as you can see here lottie allows you to

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.958
Caption: search for different hamburgers so if

00:04:08.878 --> 00:04:12.399
Caption: you were looking for some design

00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.238
Caption: inspiration

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:16.160
Caption: on what your hamburger micro

00:04:14.238 --> 00:04:17.759
Caption: interactions could look like you can

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.359
Caption: find it here even if you&#39;re not going to

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.359
Caption: use one of these as a starting point

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:27.599
Caption: lottie files also includes a simple

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:28.799
Caption: editor

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.800
Caption: so

00:04:28.799 --> 00:04:34.159
Caption: we&#39;re going to go and play a little bit

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:34.159
Caption: with the lolly that i had

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:42.478
Caption: and play with the melting lolly colors

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.199
Caption: as you can see as it&#39;s loaded

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.160
Caption: even a really simple animation like this

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.199
Caption: one

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.559
Caption: has got a lot of different components

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.080
Caption: let&#39;s see what happens when we try and

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:54.320
Caption: change a few colors

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:57.559
Caption: so changing the color of the stick is

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.559
Caption: pretty easy

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:03.199
Caption: let&#39;s say i want a different flavor of

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:06.319
Caption: lolly i&#39;m gonna go in for something

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.679
Caption: that&#39;s uh kind of like a a cool one on a

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.520
Caption: hot day

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:11.279
Caption: something nice and icy

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:13.359
Caption: oops

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:15.199
Caption: and you can see here why

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:16.638
Caption: you want to maybe go back and do that

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.520
Caption: quick search in a place i mentioned

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.399
Caption: earlier because now i&#39;ve got all these

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.959
Caption: other

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:26.239
Caption: drips and drip shadows i probably want

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:26.239
Caption: to go and tweak the colors off

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:31.600
Caption: so

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.119
Caption: having edited this

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.199
Caption: you&#39;ll notice there is an export

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:37.919
Caption: available so i can just drop this little

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.919
Caption: json file straight down onto my desktop

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.839
Caption: or if i&#39;d done a superb job of editing

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.800
Caption: it i could put it back on lottie files

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.880
Caption: and

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:46.879
Caption: put a description there as to why green

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.880
Caption: lollies are much better than pink ones

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.880
Caption: so let&#39;s go back and look at

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:57.839
Caption: skipping over my pre-saved screenshots

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.079
Caption: the graphical editors were really here

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:01.359
Caption: to learn about

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:03.839
Caption: i&#39;m going to talk about three products

00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:06.478
Caption: here synfig is

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:10.479
Caption: your classic cross-platform open source

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:12.080
Caption: product so synfig is

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.679
Caption: interesting to use a little bit more

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:15.519
Caption: fragile than the others

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:17.440
Caption: most of the keyboard controls will be

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:18.959
Caption: control keys rather than command keys

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.319
Caption: for mac users

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:21.199
Caption: it&#39;s free so you could go in and hey if

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.479
Caption: you notice anything you don&#39;t like

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.160
Caption: you&#39;re always going to fix it and submit

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.319
Caption: the source code back up

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.199
Caption: it&#39;s an older product as well and if

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:31.119
Caption: you&#39;ve used blender 3d for example it&#39;ll

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:33.199
Caption: seem familiar to you it&#39;s quite an

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.959
Caption: awkward product to use once you get used

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.639
Caption: to it however it&#39;s amazingly powerful

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:38.479
Caption: i&#39;ll talk about that more in a minute

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.880
Caption: key shape is a commercial product that

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:42.720
Caption: 47 wants off price so you&#39;re seeing

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.559
Caption: that&#39;s a mac app store download so you

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.239
Caption: put it on multiple

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:49.279
Caption: seats for yourself

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:51.440
Caption: and flow is a much higher end product

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:53.279
Caption: that does user interface animation and a

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.759
Caption: lot more code generation and export

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:58.079
Caption: features i&#39;ll come back to which is why

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:59.919
Caption: it&#39;s got that extra price

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:01.918
Caption: all three of these provide the ability

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:04.240
Caption: to draw within the interface but flow

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:06.639
Caption: started more drawing importing from a

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:08.479
Caption: sketch drawing and so their emphasis is

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:10.720
Caption: still more towards tweaking within the

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:10.720
Caption: tool

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:15.199
Caption: so it&#39;s and by the way adobe after

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.399
Caption: effects is 30 a month unless you&#39;ve got

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.000
Caption: one of those great specials or you&#39;re

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:20.160
Caption: doing a high-end bundle

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.720
Caption: let&#39;s talk about synfig

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.919
Caption: so it&#39;s more for people who are doing 3d

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.759
Caption: movies

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:27.919
Caption: rather than doing little user interface

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:29.759
Caption: animations but it is a visual editor you

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:31.199
Caption: could use to do those animations and

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.440
Caption: it&#39;s the only one that works on windows

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:35.360
Caption: and linux so it may still be something

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.799
Caption: you want to consider but as something

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:38.719
Caption: that&#39;s aimed towards people who are

00:07:36.799 --> 00:07:40.319
Caption: doing 2d animations you&#39;ve got the

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.559
Caption: ability to animate faces you&#39;ve got the

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:44.399
Caption: ability to have people walking and doing

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:46.000
Caption: animations of the body

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:48.319
Caption: and it&#39;s very much about tweening

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.679
Caption: between positions so let&#39;s go over to

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:53.199
Caption: synfig and see what that looks like

00:07:51.679 --> 00:07:55.039
Caption: so i&#39;m going to start off with a new

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.800
Caption: document

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:59.360
Caption: and i just crashed cinfig remember i

00:07:56.799 --> 00:08:02.399
Caption: said synfig studio is one of the more

00:07:59.359 --> 00:08:05.598
Caption: fragile things this goes with it being a

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:07.919
Caption: um a cross-platform open source product

00:08:05.598 --> 00:08:09.919
Caption: so apologies for that minor

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:13.080
Caption: hiccup there let&#39;s see if we can launch

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:13.080
Caption: it again

00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:18.239
Caption: right we now have a stage on which to

00:08:17.119 --> 00:08:20.079
Caption: work

00:08:18.239 --> 00:08:22.239
Caption: so i&#39;m going to draw

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:26.119
Caption: a little circle here we&#39;ll pretend for

00:08:22.239 --> 00:08:26.119
Caption: now this is a bouncing ball

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:31.279
Caption: like older style graphic tools you often

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:33.278
Caption: go in and you use a tool to move things

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:35.440
Caption: and adjust them so all i&#39;m going to be

00:08:33.278 --> 00:08:37.200
Caption: doing today is just using the move tool

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.000
Caption: but i&#39;m going to make this animated so

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.598
Caption: to make it animated i go and turn on

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.559
Caption: animation mode with the little green

00:08:41.598 --> 00:08:44.000
Caption: person

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:47.119
Caption: and we are now

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.799
Caption: in an animation recording mode

00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:50.799
Caption: remember i said this is movie oriented

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:52.719
Caption: so it talks about frames

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:55.599
Caption: and

00:08:52.719 --> 00:08:57.518
Caption: i&#39;m going to jump to

00:08:55.599 --> 00:08:58.719
Caption: one second in the timeline so down the

00:08:57.518 --> 00:08:59.440
Caption: bottom here

00:08:58.719 --> 00:09:01.439
Caption: all

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.119
Caption: animation products have some kind of

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.359
Caption: timeline literally how things change

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:07.039
Caption: over time in this case it&#39;s move what

00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:10.479
Caption: they call the playhead to this this

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:11.838
Caption: position one second 24 frames and at one

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:14.880
Caption: second

00:09:11.838 --> 00:09:18.799
Caption: i want the ball to move down to here

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:21.760
Caption: i&#39;m going to jump again to two seconds

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:23.518
Caption: and at that point i want the ball to

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.720
Caption: bounce up to there again normally if

00:09:23.518 --> 00:09:26.079
Caption: you&#39;re going to animate this you would

00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:28.079
Caption: squish the ball when it hits but we

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.920
Caption: won&#39;t worry about that for a simple demo

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.959
Caption: like this so i&#39;ll jump back out of this

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:32.639
Caption: mode

00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:35.039
Caption: very modal stuff because that&#39;s your

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.640
Caption: classic old style approach and let&#39;s go

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:39.199
Caption: back and look what my little animation

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.200
Caption: looks like now

00:09:39.599 --> 00:09:43.119
Caption: there we go i now have an animated

00:09:41.599 --> 00:09:46.000
Caption: moving ball

00:09:43.119 --> 00:09:46.000
Caption: i&#39;ll save this

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.239
Caption: in my animations folder

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.958
Caption: and

00:09:54.398 --> 00:10:00.398
Caption: animations are exported to lottie from

00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:02.640
Caption: synfig using a plugin so i can now do

00:10:00.398 --> 00:10:02.640
Caption: that

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.799
Caption: and it&#39;s created a json plugin for me

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Caption: i go over into my animations folder

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:12.000
Caption: i&#39;ve got

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.760
Caption: rec day

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.239
Caption: with a little html

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.239
Caption: display

00:10:17.518 --> 00:10:20.320
Caption: that&#39;s synfig

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.919
Caption: now let&#39;s talk about

00:10:26.398 --> 00:10:31.039
Caption: key shape

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:32.958
Caption: key shape is a great vector editor if

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:34.320
Caption: you wanted to do animations from scratch

00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.078
Caption: even if you&#39;re just putting out movies

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.760
Caption: or gifs i would recommend this as the

00:10:36.078 --> 00:10:40.479
Caption: mac tool to use

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.160
Caption: as i said it&#39;s only 47 to install on a

00:10:40.479 --> 00:10:45.679
Caption: few of your devices

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:47.119
Caption: their import export is via plugins and

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:49.440
Caption: those are all open source so if you want

00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:51.119
Caption: to fix their plugins or customize them

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.799
Caption: or do your own for a different format

00:10:51.119 --> 00:10:54.559
Caption: you can go ahead and do that and as you

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:56.719
Caption: can see from the error message i snipped

00:10:54.559 --> 00:10:58.880
Caption: below the melting lolly with just a

00:10:56.719 --> 00:11:00.799
Caption: little bit too much melting gooeyness

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.119
Caption: for it to cope with

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:05.599
Caption: so i like that little black hamburger i

00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:07.679
Caption: had earlier next to the text demo let&#39;s

00:11:05.599 --> 00:11:08.799
Caption: go over to keyshape

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:12.239
Caption: and

00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:12.239
Caption: bring in a hamburger

00:11:12.398 --> 00:11:16.479
Caption: because i&#39;ve already installed the

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.479
Caption: lottie plugin the json files show up as

00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:20.958
Caption: files i can open and you can see in the

00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:22.479
Caption: preview there that really is

00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.159
Caption: ugly json

00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:26.880
Caption: but when it comes in here it is

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:28.479
Caption: beautiful animation

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.160
Caption: now because we&#39;re not just importing a

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:32.719
Caption: graphic but we&#39;re importing a full-blown

00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:35.440
Caption: animation we&#39;ve immediately got a

00:11:32.719 --> 00:11:36.398
Caption: timeline down the bottom here

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.000
Caption: which

00:11:36.398 --> 00:11:39.838
Caption: shows the animation of all of those

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.440
Caption: parts and

00:11:39.838 --> 00:11:42.479
Caption: i can play it and you&#39;ll see it quickly

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.919
Caption: animate

00:11:42.479 --> 00:11:46.239
Caption: and i can also

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:48.078
Caption: scrub

00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:51.359
Caption: the playhead backwards and forwards

00:11:48.078 --> 00:11:53.199
Caption: through the timeline to see things

00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:54.719
Caption: at my own pace

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.880
Caption: this is a commercial product it&#39;s been

00:11:54.719 --> 00:11:58.559
Caption: around for years and so it does look a

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.599
Caption: little bit more friendly and polished

00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:01.359
Caption: than

00:11:59.599 --> 00:12:02.799
Caption: synfig studio oh the other thing i

00:12:01.359 --> 00:12:04.398
Caption: didn&#39;t mention synfig studio the

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:06.559
Caption: documentation is a little bit thin

00:12:04.398 --> 00:12:08.398
Caption: because it&#39;s an open source product

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:10.479
Caption: go ahead and add documentation to it

00:12:08.398 --> 00:12:12.638
Caption: people would love that key shape and

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:14.559
Caption: flow have both got superb sites with

00:12:12.638 --> 00:12:16.000
Caption: lots of documentation lots of video

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:17.518
Caption: tutorials

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.958
Caption: so what i&#39;m going to do to start with

00:12:17.518 --> 00:12:20.799
Caption: i&#39;m looking down here i notice we&#39;ve got

00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:23.278
Caption: ketchup here but this is a black

00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:25.359
Caption: animation and i loathe the thought of

00:12:23.278 --> 00:12:26.958
Caption: black ketchup it brings back horrible

00:12:25.359 --> 00:12:29.440
Caption: thoughts of sharehouses and bottles that

00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:31.760
Caption: should have been discarded years ago so

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.479
Caption: i&#39;m going to change my ketchup to a more

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.239
Caption: appropriate ketchup color and i did that

00:12:34.479 --> 00:12:38.799
Caption: by selecting the path here that&#39;s under

00:12:36.239 --> 00:12:40.880
Caption: the ketchup on the left hand side and

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:42.239
Caption: i&#39;ve now changed that to red but it&#39;s

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.679
Caption: not showing up

00:12:42.239 --> 00:12:46.479
Caption: that&#39;s because

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:48.559
Caption: the ketchup has yet to drip so if i

00:12:46.479 --> 00:12:50.320
Caption: play with the playhead there goes the

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:51.119
Caption: ketchup and it&#39;s now red

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.119
Caption: okay

00:12:51.119 --> 00:12:55.039
Caption: the person who designed this likes their

00:12:53.119 --> 00:12:57.359
Caption: button to pop up at the top i don&#39;t

00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:59.759
Caption: particularly like the timing of how that

00:12:57.359 --> 00:13:03.119
Caption: bun&#39;s popping up so let me introduce you

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:05.760
Caption: to the concept of timing curves

00:13:03.119 --> 00:13:07.039
Caption: so here we have

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.078
Caption: the

00:13:07.039 --> 00:13:11.919
Caption: timeline showing how things change

00:13:10.078 --> 00:13:14.479
Caption: and sometimes you want them to change at

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:18.078
Caption: a different pace if you look closely on

00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:20.479
Caption: the timeline here this top bun has got a

00:13:18.078 --> 00:13:22.958
Caption: position changing in a linear mode which

00:13:20.479 --> 00:13:26.078
Caption: means it changes evenly but the shape is

00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:28.479
Caption: changing with a bezier mode

00:13:26.078 --> 00:13:30.958
Caption: what that means is if i go down into

00:13:28.479 --> 00:13:33.679
Caption: their bezier edit their timing curve

00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:35.518
Caption: editor that bezier is that shape so it&#39;s

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:37.599
Caption: actually pretty close to a straight line

00:13:35.518 --> 00:13:40.078
Caption: it&#39;s changing about the same rate i want

00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:41.679
Caption: that to pop up a lot more so i&#39;m going

00:13:40.078 --> 00:13:43.760
Caption: to drag these handles if you&#39;ve ever

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:46.078
Caption: done any spline editing

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.160
Caption: in any visual drawing tool this is

00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:50.559
Caption: exactly the same as editing curves there

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:52.799
Caption: it&#39;s just this is a timing curve

00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:55.119
Caption: rather than a

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:55.838
Caption: space curve or a shape curve

00:13:55.119 --> 00:13:57.760
Caption: so

00:13:55.838 --> 00:13:59.119
Caption: having modified that let&#39;s see what

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.040
Caption: happens

00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:04.000
Caption: now when i play there&#39;s a little bit

00:14:01.039 --> 00:14:06.799
Caption: more pop as the bun goes up so i&#39;m

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.799
Caption: pretty happy with that

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:11.278
Caption: i&#39;m so

00:14:09.359 --> 00:14:14.679
Caption: having done all this i&#39;m now going to

00:14:11.278 --> 00:14:14.679
Caption: export it

00:14:17.359 --> 00:14:21.760
Caption: my export formats because i have the

00:14:19.119 --> 00:14:23.440
Caption: plugin include lottie

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.479
Caption: and i&#39;m just going to call that my rec

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.919
Caption: day

00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:29.719
Caption: lottie because i don&#39;t want to overwrite

00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:29.719
Caption: the one i started with

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:37.760
Caption: i&#39;ll put that in my animations folder

00:14:35.518 --> 00:14:40.000
Caption: now unlike the other ones

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:43.278
Caption: i don&#39;t get a nice

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.919
Caption: generated preview html but remember

00:14:43.278 --> 00:14:46.880
Caption: lottie files is a very comprehensive

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:51.039
Caption: site

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.039
Caption: so let&#39;s go back to the logi file site

00:14:51.198 --> 00:14:53.440
Caption: and

00:14:53.919 --> 00:14:57.119
Caption: amongst oops sorry amongst the lottie

00:14:56.159 --> 00:15:00.398
Caption: files

00:14:57.119 --> 00:15:00.398
Caption: tools at the top here

00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:08.159
Caption: in the design area is a previewer this

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:09.759
Caption: allows you to take any json file you&#39;ve

00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:12.719
Caption: found somewhere else or you&#39;ve created

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.479
Caption: with one of these other tools

00:15:12.719 --> 00:15:16.239
Caption: and preview it on the web

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:19.119
Caption: so here&#39;s my

00:15:16.239 --> 00:15:20.719
Caption: hamburger rec day that we just edited

00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:23.039
Caption: and when i open it on the lottie file

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:23.039
Caption: site

00:15:23.599 --> 00:15:29.278
Caption: ta-da we have a poppy bun and red

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.278
Caption: ketchup so lottie files loves you to

00:15:29.278 --> 00:15:33.039
Caption: share and i could go in and share right

00:15:31.278 --> 00:15:34.559
Caption: away i think we&#39;ve done enough with that

00:15:33.039 --> 00:15:35.758
Caption: for now

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:39.359
Caption: so

00:15:35.758 --> 00:15:42.159
Caption: let&#39;s go back to our presentation and

00:15:39.359 --> 00:15:45.119
Caption: we&#39;ll skip through a couple of carefully

00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:47.198
Caption: saved screens and talk about flow

00:15:45.119 --> 00:15:49.198
Caption: as i said earlier flow is focused on

00:15:47.198 --> 00:15:51.359
Caption: user interface animation

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:53.599
Caption: so whilst it includes lottie export for

00:15:51.359 --> 00:15:56.000
Caption: the web it&#39;s also got native code

00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:57.919
Caption: wrappers for lottie so it&#39;ll export a

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.198
Caption: workable ielts or android project you

00:15:57.919 --> 00:16:02.880
Caption: can show your lottie within and

00:16:01.198 --> 00:16:04.479
Caption: very quickly mention a non-lottie topic

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.198
Caption: one of the reasons it&#39;s so expensive is

00:16:04.479 --> 00:16:09.359
Caption: it does these compilable native

00:16:07.198 --> 00:16:11.440
Caption: animations so if you had

00:16:09.359 --> 00:16:13.679
Caption: 20 buttons that were animated apart from

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.799
Caption: driving your users crazy that screen

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:17.919
Caption: would probably have something like about

00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:20.559
Caption: 160k worth of assets if they were lottie

00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:22.559
Caption: files if they were generated as

00:16:20.559 --> 00:16:25.119
Caption: native compiled stuff that would come

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:28.799
Caption: down to maybe

00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:29.758
Caption: 2k of binary change

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:31.278
Caption: so

00:16:29.758 --> 00:16:35.518
Caption: flow

00:16:31.278 --> 00:16:37.359
Caption: originally started importing from sketch

00:16:35.518 --> 00:16:39.359
Caption: and the important thing to know about

00:16:37.359 --> 00:16:40.559
Caption: this this is a tweening thing where it

00:16:39.359 --> 00:16:41.838
Caption: is mapping

00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:43.758
Caption: the starting

00:16:41.838 --> 00:16:46.239
Caption: artboard and an artboard in sketch is

00:16:43.758 --> 00:16:48.078
Caption: just a container for a bit of a drawing

00:16:46.239 --> 00:16:50.320
Caption: to the ending artboard and they have to

00:16:48.078 --> 00:16:52.638
Caption: be utterly identical so structurally

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.440
Caption: they have to be the same i&#39;ve just hand

00:16:52.638 --> 00:16:57.359
Caption: edited a bit of the ddd logo here

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.599
Caption: and you can see i want to end up with

00:16:57.359 --> 00:17:01.599
Caption: some eyes on there if you look down here

00:16:59.599 --> 00:17:02.638
Caption: you can see i&#39;ve actually also got those

00:17:01.599 --> 00:17:05.038
Caption: eyes

00:17:02.638 --> 00:17:06.400
Caption: on the starting position so my structure

00:17:05.038 --> 00:17:08.239
Caption: is identical

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.799
Caption: however

00:17:08.239 --> 00:17:12.078
Caption: the opacity is turned down to zero

00:17:10.798 --> 00:17:14.558
Caption: so let&#39;s

00:17:12.078 --> 00:17:17.280
Caption: whizz over into flow

00:17:14.558 --> 00:17:19.038
Caption: and create a new document

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.559
Caption: and i&#39;m going to link a sketch file it

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:24.318
Caption: could be starting from figma which is in

00:17:20.558 --> 00:17:27.038
Caption: beta or it could be starting from

00:17:24.318 --> 00:17:27.038
Caption: an svg

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.280
Caption: so when you open the sketch file it&#39;ll

00:17:29.678 --> 00:17:33.279
Caption: go through and it&#39;ll do previews of all

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.559
Caption: the artboards in there i&#39;ve only got the

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.479
Caption: two in here so i&#39;m just obviously going

00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:37.760
Caption: to drag the one i called start and the

00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:39.760
Caption: one i called end that&#39;s just my

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.400
Caption: convention doesn&#39;t mean anything

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.919
Caption: and that&#39;s it i now have an animation so

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.839
Caption: it&#39;s immediately it&#39;s worked out it

00:17:43.918 --> 00:17:47.439
Caption: should interpolate between those two if

00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:49.599
Caption: i play that

00:17:47.439 --> 00:17:51.839
Caption: i&#39;ve got those two shapes moving and the

00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:54.640
Caption: eyes appearing which is the opacity

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:54.640
Caption: being animated

00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.479
Caption: down the bottom we have what&#39;s possibly

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.760
Caption: now becoming familiar as a timeline and

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:03.678
Caption: they actually call it a timeline which

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.880
Caption: makes it really obvious to you

00:18:03.678 --> 00:18:06.640
Caption: and you can see

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.558
Caption: the attributes it&#39;s worked out that&#39;s

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.678
Caption: animating between there

00:18:08.558 --> 00:18:11.760
Caption: so

00:18:09.678 --> 00:18:13.678
Caption: i don&#39;t know if there was actually any

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.798
Caption: change in the x position obviously the y

00:18:13.678 --> 00:18:19.119
Caption: position things moved up and the opacity

00:18:16.798 --> 00:18:21.839
Caption: changed

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:23.359
Caption: so let&#39;s say

00:18:21.839 --> 00:18:25.760
Caption: i wanted the green to be a little bit

00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:27.280
Caption: cheeky and to start winking at us a

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.280
Caption: little bit earlier

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.520
Caption: so the winking effect is basically just

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.359
Caption: the opacity when does the eye show up

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.479
Caption: i&#39;m going to

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:38.079
Caption: scale my timeline so it&#39;s easy to edit

00:18:36.479 --> 00:18:39.678
Caption: and i&#39;m going to make that

00:18:38.079 --> 00:18:41.199
Caption: eye open

00:18:39.678 --> 00:18:43.760
Caption: an awful lot

00:18:41.199 --> 00:18:45.678
Caption: earlier now let&#39;s see what happens

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.479
Caption: there we go in fact that that&#39;s a little

00:18:45.678 --> 00:18:50.880
Caption: bit too quick so why don&#39;t i go and slow

00:18:48.479 --> 00:18:52.160
Caption: down my timeline so i&#39;ll make it four

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.400
Caption: seconds long

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.880
Caption: and i&#39;ll scale it if i just wanted to

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.640
Caption: add extra animations at the end i&#39;d say

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.039
Caption: expand but i want it stretched over that

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:05.200
Caption: time so now i have a four second

00:19:01.038 --> 00:19:05.199
Caption: animation i&#39;ll go back to beginning

00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:16.479
Caption: and that eye winks pretty quickly

00:19:13.918 --> 00:19:17.678
Caption: let&#39;s go and play with some curves

00:19:16.479 --> 00:19:18.880
Caption: so

00:19:17.678 --> 00:19:21.519
Caption: i want

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.199
Caption: my pink

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.760
Caption: to move up quickly

00:19:23.199 --> 00:19:26.959
Caption: i don&#39;t want the eyes to vanish

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.320
Caption: out of the

00:19:26.959 --> 00:19:29.279
Caption: shape so i&#39;m actually going to have to

00:19:28.319 --> 00:19:31.279
Caption: go in

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.919
Caption: i&#39;m going to expand this a little bit

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.520
Caption: and you can see here i&#39;ve got

00:19:33.918 --> 00:19:38.319
Caption: my

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:41.359
Caption: timing curve for opacity so for y

00:19:38.319 --> 00:19:43.119
Caption: position for the pink right eye the pink

00:19:41.359 --> 00:19:46.319
Caption: left eye

00:19:43.119 --> 00:19:46.319
Caption: and the overall d

00:19:46.558 --> 00:19:49.760
Caption: i&#39;m going to change those what am i

00:19:47.918 --> 00:19:51.359
Caption: going to do with those let&#39;s see

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.359
Caption: how about

00:19:51.359 --> 00:19:55.599
Caption: we&#39;re a bit slow to start

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:58.079
Caption: so i&#39;ve got all three selected

00:19:55.599 --> 00:19:59.599
Caption: and i can just drag those oops i haven&#39;t

00:19:58.079 --> 00:20:00.399
Caption: got all three selected because i missed

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:01.678
Caption: them

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.119
Caption: drag that

00:20:01.678 --> 00:20:04.719
Caption: click on that one so now i&#39;ve got all

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:06.719
Caption: three i&#39;m holding down the command key

00:20:04.719 --> 00:20:08.558
Caption: to get a multiple selection much as you

00:20:06.719 --> 00:20:10.719
Caption: would with shapes

00:20:08.558 --> 00:20:11.839
Caption: and so if i drag those three over what

00:20:10.719 --> 00:20:15.038
Caption: happens

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:17.439
Caption: so we&#39;re taking a one second

00:20:15.038 --> 00:20:17.439
Caption: start

00:20:17.918 --> 00:20:20.719
Caption: and it slowly comes up and matches the

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:22.479
Caption: others

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:25.599
Caption: but i want to have a bit of a sense of

00:20:22.479 --> 00:20:27.760
Caption: panic in there having been left behind

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:27.760
Caption: so

00:20:28.558 --> 00:20:34.959
Caption: pink is going to

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:37.599
Caption: come up with a different easing curve

00:20:34.959 --> 00:20:39.839
Caption: so i&#39;ve got the three things selected

00:20:37.599 --> 00:20:41.439
Caption: one two three and over on the right hand

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:43.038
Caption: side here you can see i can choose

00:20:41.439 --> 00:20:45.359
Caption: easing so this

00:20:43.038 --> 00:20:47.439
Caption: has got three keyframes selected that

00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:49.839
Caption: are all compatible properties

00:20:47.439 --> 00:20:51.439
Caption: and let&#39;s just make it

00:20:49.839 --> 00:20:53.599
Caption: something that

00:20:51.439 --> 00:20:55.038
Caption: a little bit slow and then

00:20:53.599 --> 00:20:58.959
Caption: jumps up pretty quickly because we

00:20:55.038 --> 00:20:58.959
Caption: started late let&#39;s see what happens now

00:21:01.199 --> 00:21:04.399
Caption: whoops yep and everyone else is catching

00:21:03.199 --> 00:21:05.918
Caption: up

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.119
Caption: let&#39;s

00:21:05.918 --> 00:21:10.558
Caption: zoom that

00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:10.558
Caption: down a bit so you can see that again

00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:20.319
Caption: voila

00:21:16.719 --> 00:21:22.798
Caption: if i want to export that from flow

00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:24.000
Caption: file export and i say i&#39;m exporting to

00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:26.239
Caption: code

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.678
Caption: and i can now choose

00:21:26.239 --> 00:21:31.000
Caption: a lotty

00:21:27.678 --> 00:21:31.000
Caption: web format

00:21:31.678 --> 00:21:34.959
Caption: i&#39;ve got to choose my timeline

00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:45.760
Caption: and if i open that

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:49.039
Caption: you see we have a nice preview again

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.039
Caption: in which we can see our animation

00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:56.038
Caption: okay and

00:21:52.719 --> 00:21:56.038
Caption: with that

00:22:00.558 --> 00:22:03.839
Caption: finish flow

00:22:01.918 --> 00:22:05.759
Caption: so we&#39;ve discussed three tools you can

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:08.239
Caption: do with

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.919
Caption: visual editing remember

00:22:08.239 --> 00:22:12.640
Caption: key shape allowed me to bring in the

00:22:09.918 --> 00:22:16.000
Caption: lottie document and visually edit it the

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:18.159
Caption: other two could only export to lottie

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Caption: and are there any questions about lottie

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:23.240
Caption: or animation general

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.239
Caption: thank you
