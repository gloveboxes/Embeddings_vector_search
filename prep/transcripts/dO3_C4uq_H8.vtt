Caption: um

00:00:01.598 --> 00:00:06.318
Caption: welcome to my session my name is megan

00:00:03.438 --> 00:00:08.638
Caption: pusey and i am presenting on how to

00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:09.920
Caption: design tutorials that your users won&#39;t

00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:11.758
Caption: ignore

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.920
Caption: first off i want to say

00:00:11.758 --> 00:00:16.000
Caption: uh thank you to the sponsors for ddd

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.479
Caption: perth without whom this event couldn&#39;t

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.399
Caption: happen and i also wanted to acknowledge

00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:22.319
Caption: the traditional custodians of the land

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.518
Caption: that we are meeting on today which is

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:26.479
Caption: the logic people of the nonga nation

00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:28.159
Caption: and

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:30.959
Caption: pay respects to their elders past

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:32.479
Caption: present and emerging so a little bit

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:34.799
Caption: about me

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:37.680
Caption: i am just finishing my phd at murdoch

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:39.840
Caption: university and my phd has been in it and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.119
Caption: education so my background&#39;s in

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.439
Caption: education and i&#39;ve um my phd&#39;s all been

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:48.078
Caption: about user research so i&#39;m sort of

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:49.919
Caption: bringing that background to this talk to

00:00:48.078 --> 00:00:51.759
Caption: talk about how people learn how our

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:54.799
Caption: brains work and how we can design for

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:56.718
Caption: that better more broadly for apps web

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:58.799
Caption: games whatever it might be so that the

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.199
Caption: onboarding and tutorial process is as

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.398
Caption: smooth as possible

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.120
Caption: um

00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:06.158
Caption: so

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.919
Caption: bad news i&#39;m afraid my title is a bit of

00:01:06.158 --> 00:01:09.759
Caption: a misnomer in that

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:12.239
Caption: we can&#39;t actually force people to do

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.319
Caption: something they don&#39;t want to do so your

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:16.559
Caption: users may still ignore your tutorials

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.680
Caption: but we&#39;re going to hopefully uh show you

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:19.438
Caption: some tricks

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.239
Caption: on how to put that information into your

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.880
Caption: products such that your users can find

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:26.959
Caption: it and still navigate and successfully

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:30.239
Caption: use your product even if they do

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:32.798
Caption: end up ignoring the initial tutorial

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:35.438
Caption: so first i wanted to talk about working

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.880
Caption: memory and how our memory works we have

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.479
Caption: short-term long-term memory and a

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:40.798
Caption: working memory which helps us when we

00:01:38.478 --> 00:01:43.279
Caption: need to remember things

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.880
Caption: to carry out a task and when we&#39;re

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:47.680
Caption: learning something new

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:49.599
Caption: um we are using our memory so for this

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.919
Caption: task i want to showcase to you the

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:53.839
Caption: limitations of our working memory i&#39;m

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:56.399
Caption: going to put up 11

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:58.319
Caption: digits or 11 numbers

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.840
Caption: and without writing them down

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.839
Caption: i&#39;d like you to try and memorize them

00:01:59.839 --> 00:02:03.519
Caption: i&#39;ll give you a few seconds

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:05.839
Caption: for those who can&#39;t see them the numbers

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:12.559
Caption: are 3 1 4

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:12.559
Caption: 1 9 four five six zero zero eight

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.360
Caption: all right got that

00:02:15.598 --> 00:02:18.639
Caption: how many can you remember can you

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.878
Caption: remember all

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.720
Caption: the whole sequence of eleven

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:24.238
Caption: maybe you can remember the first few and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.399
Caption: the last few generally that&#39;s what

00:02:24.238 --> 00:02:29.360
Caption: happens when we try and remember things

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:30.639
Caption: um but it&#39;s really tricky to remember

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.279
Caption: irrelevant

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:35.919
Caption: disconnected pieces of information

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:38.319
Caption: and i just gave you random numbers there

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:40.080
Caption: so one way we can make that easier on

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.839
Caption: our memory and the way our brain works

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.360
Caption: is to group

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:45.679
Caption: numbers together or pieces of

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.598
Caption: information together in categories so

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:49.359
Caption: that instead of trying to remember 11

00:02:47.598 --> 00:02:51.598
Caption: things we&#39;re just remembering three

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.319
Caption: things and if we give it meaning or

00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:56.800
Caption: purpose it is instantly a lot easier to

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.360
Caption: remember for example the first four

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.839
Caption: numbers were the first four digits of pi

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.000
Caption: 94.5 is a radio station in perth and

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:07.598
Caption: 6008 is the postcode for subiaco so in

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.440
Caption: that case we have something to link it

00:03:07.598 --> 00:03:12.319
Caption: to our memory instead of just trying to

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.559
Caption: remember 11 random pieces of information

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.720
Caption: um with remembering phone numbers these

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:19.279
Caption: are made up for numbers

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.440
Caption: we often grip them in chunks

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.119
Caption: so you might mentally recognize that

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.238
Caption: you&#39;re grouping phone numbers in chunks

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:29.279
Caption: rather than trying to remember 11 or 9

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:32.559
Caption: pieces of information so what that means

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:34.958
Caption: for design is it&#39;s better if you give

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:37.360
Caption: the tutorial or onboarding onboarding

00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:39.039
Caption: process meaning for example this is from

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.639
Caption: duolingo which is a language learning

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:43.119
Caption: app they&#39;re asking you right at the

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.720
Caption: start why are you using this app

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.080
Caption: so they&#39;re segmenting their users and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.639
Caption: offering them a different onboarding

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.319
Caption: experience based on why they&#39;re there to

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:54.798
Caption: make it more meaningful to the user

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.518
Caption: we also want to try to

00:03:54.798 --> 00:03:59.199
Caption: avoid over taxing the memory and just

00:03:57.518 --> 00:04:01.839
Caption: provide information

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:04.639
Caption: just in time when it is needed

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:06.559
Caption: a wall of text right at the start is not

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.639
Caption: the way to go in onboarding and

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.839
Caption: tutorials people will ignore that

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.238
Caption: whereas if you provide them the

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:15.279
Caption: information when it&#39;s meaningful it&#39;s a

00:04:12.238 --> 00:04:17.679
Caption: lot more effective another example of

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:19.600
Caption: providing information just in time this

00:04:17.679 --> 00:04:20.958
Caption: is an app for coding a robot that they

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.119
Caption: use in education

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.520
Caption: for the dash and dot robots

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:27.119
Caption: this is the code and you press start

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:29.279
Caption: down the bottom left to send the code

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:31.279
Caption: via bluetooth to the robot however in

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.959
Caption: this case i wasn&#39;t connected to a robot

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:35.919
Caption: and it was only after i pressed the

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:38.399
Caption: start button that this prompt appeared

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.479
Caption: asking me to connect to the robot so the

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:43.359
Caption: information appeared at the time i

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.360
Caption: needed it because it recognized i had

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:47.679
Caption: not connected to a robot so it wasn&#39;t

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:50.079
Caption: going to work

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:52.320
Caption: unfortunately people still forget things

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:54.638
Caption: very very easily so you will need to

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.559
Caption: remind them and unfortunately by the end

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.360
Caption: of this talk about 20 minutes you&#39;ll

00:04:56.559 --> 00:05:01.119
Caption: probably only remember about 60 of what

00:04:59.359 --> 00:05:02.399
Caption: i said and by tomorrow that will be down

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:05.199
Caption: to 30

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:06.639
Caption: so if you have repeat users even after

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.839
Caption: being a first-time user you&#39;re still

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.759
Caption: going to need to remind them of key

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:13.679
Caption: features um or room or showcase new

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.839
Caption: features or things that have changed

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:17.679
Caption: within your app this is an example of

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:19.359
Caption: the linkedin app

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:22.239
Caption: and a little tooltip that appeared when

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:23.279
Caption: they first introduced reactions to a new

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:25.359
Caption: feature

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.799
Caption: but i noticed my banking app was also

00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:29.119
Caption: using this sort of thing when i logged

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:31.039
Caption: in because they had moved one of the

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:33.039
Caption: menu icons and so the next few times

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.000
Caption: they logged in it reminded me that that

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:38.239
Caption: icon had moved so reminders for repeat

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.079
Caption: users are still really important people

00:05:38.239 --> 00:05:44.799
Caption: forget things very very easily

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:45.599
Caption: moving on to attention

00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:46.959
Caption: uh

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.959
Caption: how long do you think your attention

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:50.720
Caption: span actually is

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:52.799
Caption: are you still paying attention to what

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.559
Caption: i&#39;m saying uh

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:56.159
Caption: apparently our attention spans are only

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:59.119
Caption: about eight seconds some of the research

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.199
Caption: has said but um i know from myself

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:02.959
Caption: personally in this sort of one-way

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.880
Caption: communication setting it only takes

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:06.959
Caption: about 10 to 15 minutes for my brain to

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.319
Caption: start wandering and thinking about what

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:10.000
Caption: i&#39;m going to be buying at the grocery

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:13.039
Caption: store that afternoon

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.759
Caption: uh so i have a little demonstration i&#39;d

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.679
Caption: like to show you about attention don&#39;t

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:20.679
Caption: worry it&#39;s only one minute and 40

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:20.679
Caption: seconds

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:27.599
Caption: the monkey business illusion

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:33.800
Caption: count how many times the players wearing

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.799
Caption: what pass the ball

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:12.240
Caption: the correct answer is 16 passes

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.160
Caption: did you spot the gorilla

00:07:12.239 --> 00:07:16.319
Caption: anyone for people who haven&#39;t seen or

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.919
Caption: heard about a video like this before

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.919
Caption: about half missed the gorilla

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:24.720
Caption: if you knew about the gorilla you

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:26.639
Caption: probably saw it but did you notice the

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.839
Caption: curtain changing color or the player on

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.839
Caption: the black team leaving the game

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:34.880
Caption: let&#39;s rewind and watch it again

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.639
Caption: here comes the gorilla and there goes a

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:45.800
Caption: player the curtain is changing from red

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:45.800
Caption: to gold

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.720
Caption: when you&#39;re looking for a gorilla you

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:54.720
Caption: often miss other unexpected

00:07:55.279 --> 00:08:01.279
Caption: and that&#39;s the monkey business illusion

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:03.519
Caption: learn more about this

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:05.039
Caption: the monkey business solution let&#39;s skip

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:07.198
Caption: it so

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:09.679
Caption: that phenomenon has been studied and is

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:11.279
Caption: called inattentional blindness which

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:12.479
Caption: means even if something is right in

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:14.319
Caption: front of you

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:16.399
Caption: you can still miss it especially if

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:18.479
Caption: you&#39;re not expecting to look for that

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:20.160
Caption: information so even as a designer if you

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:22.160
Caption: think well the information&#39;s all there

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.959
Caption: surely they saw it

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.360
Caption: no

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:26.799
Caption: sometimes users can still miss vital

00:08:25.359 --> 00:08:29.119
Caption: things even though it&#39;s right in front

00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:30.878
Caption: of them so don&#39;t assume that everything

00:08:29.119 --> 00:08:32.398
Caption: that is on the screen is being paid

00:08:30.878 --> 00:08:33.760
Caption: attention to

00:08:32.398 --> 00:08:37.039
Caption: one way to help

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.838
Caption: uh design around the attention aspect is

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:41.440
Caption: to provide information on demand so that

00:08:39.838 --> 00:08:43.039
Caption: if a user missed that piece of

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.278
Caption: information they could always access it

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:47.838
Caption: later on when it&#39;s needed

00:08:45.278 --> 00:08:49.599
Caption: for example um just an example from last

00:08:47.838 --> 00:08:51.200
Caption: week for me i was filling in an online

00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:52.719
Caption: form it&#39;s not pretty looking but that&#39;s

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.640
Caption: not the point

00:08:52.719 --> 00:08:57.199
Caption: next to the fields was a question mark

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.080
Caption: symbol a lot of uh fields or forms to

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.000
Caption: use this now whereby i could click the

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.480
Caption: question mark to find out more

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.880
Caption: information about what was required in

00:09:04.479 --> 00:09:09.518
Caption: this field so if i&#39;d forgotten what an

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.440
Caption: acm citation reference was i could click

00:09:09.518 --> 00:09:13.838
Caption: on the question mark and find out

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.518
Caption: exactly what they were after so i&#39;m not

00:09:13.838 --> 00:09:17.278
Caption: having to remember that piece of

00:09:15.518 --> 00:09:19.518
Caption: information if i wasn&#39;t paying attention

00:09:17.278 --> 00:09:21.679
Caption: and i forgot what that word meant i

00:09:19.518 --> 00:09:23.278
Caption: could easily go and find out and it was

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:24.799
Caption: in context with the field so i didn&#39;t

00:09:23.278 --> 00:09:27.518
Caption: have to go to a whole separate glossary

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:30.000
Caption: page to find that information

00:09:27.518 --> 00:09:32.159
Caption: another example of this is

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Caption: just yesterday i opened up a new asana

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:36.479
Caption: account just to show you the first time

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.838
Caption: user experience down the bottom left is

00:09:36.479 --> 00:09:41.679
Caption: a help in getting started

00:09:39.838 --> 00:09:44.000
Caption: menu that you can click and it brings up

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:46.719
Caption: this whole extra section on the left

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.559
Caption: here with highly detailed information

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:51.278
Caption: about how to get started or how to do

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:53.518
Caption: certain tasks on asana their initial

00:09:51.278 --> 00:09:54.880
Caption: introduction just asks you what you&#39;re

00:09:53.518 --> 00:09:56.559
Caption: there for why you want to use it and

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.479
Caption: helps you set it up and get gets you

00:09:56.559 --> 00:10:00.320
Caption: going very quickly and then they leave

00:09:58.479 --> 00:10:01.679
Caption: the in-depth stuff till later on because

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.200
Caption: they know you just want to get started

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:05.039
Caption: using the product and you&#39;re not going

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.838
Caption: to be paying attention to all the finer

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:09.278
Caption: details and features of that product at

00:10:07.838 --> 00:10:12.159
Caption: that time

00:10:09.278 --> 00:10:15.200
Caption: another key thing that really helps with

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:17.838
Caption: our i guess lack of paying attention is

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.880
Caption: giving feedback on user actions be that

00:10:17.838 --> 00:10:23.278
Caption: positive or negative feedback both are

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.278
Caption: equally important so

00:10:23.278 --> 00:10:26.640
Caption: recently i was trying to earlier this

00:10:25.278 --> 00:10:28.640
Caption: year trying to enroll my daughter in

Caption: after school care not this after school

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.040
Caption: care but this was the form

00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:34.719
Caption: each field had a feedback as to whether

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:36.559
Caption: i had filled in correctly or not so a

00:10:34.719 --> 00:10:38.958
Caption: tick for yes you&#39;ve done this field

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:40.479
Caption: correct uh red circle with the dash

00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.719
Caption: through it for no you haven&#39;t done this

00:10:40.479 --> 00:10:44.559
Caption: one correctly yet the submit button was

00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:46.559
Caption: also grayed out and i could not select

00:10:44.559 --> 00:10:50.398
Caption: it until i had filled in everything

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:52.159
Caption: successfully however in this my case i

00:10:50.398 --> 00:10:53.838
Caption: had filled everything in successfully as

00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:56.078
Caption: far as i knew and i still couldn&#39;t

00:10:53.838 --> 00:10:58.159
Caption: submit couldn&#39;t figure out why i got

00:10:56.078 --> 00:10:59.679
Caption: very frustrated emailed tried to email

00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:00.799
Caption: and call as well to figure out what was

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:02.880
Caption: going on

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:04.880
Caption: only a few days later just by

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.640
Caption: happenstance i

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.200
Caption: was talking to someone in the school

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.760
Caption: community and they oh that after school

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.518
Caption: club closed down at the end of 2020 but

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.000
Caption: that information was nowhere on the

00:11:13.518 --> 00:11:18.479
Caption: website it was still available to select

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.239
Caption: as a service name and the service email

00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:22.000
Caption: didn&#39;t even have an automatic reply to

00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:24.398
Caption: tell me they were no longer operating so

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.078
Caption: there was no feedback to me

00:11:24.398 --> 00:11:27.599
Caption: to let me know that i could i&#39;m not

00:11:26.078 --> 00:11:29.039
Caption: going to be able to complete this action

00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:30.880
Caption: because that service doesn&#39;t exist

00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:32.239
Caption: anymore i went back just the other day

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.838
Caption: to get this screenshot and the service

00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:36.159
Caption: isn&#39;t on there anymore

00:11:33.838 --> 00:11:39.119
Caption: so you can&#39;t try and enroll for it but

00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:41.039
Caption: that to me i had no idea why

00:11:39.119 --> 00:11:42.559
Caption: i could not successfully complete this

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:44.559
Caption: action and that was very frustrating for

00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:47.200
Caption: me

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:49.078
Caption: the last thing i wanted to cover

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.278
Caption: and talk about was

00:11:49.078 --> 00:11:52.719
Caption: misinterpretation so

00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:57.440
Caption: in my background i do a lot of

00:11:52.719 --> 00:11:59.759
Caption: communicating work speaking teaching and

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.599
Caption: anytime you communicate an idea there

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.000
Caption: will always be someone who misinterprets

00:12:01.599 --> 00:12:06.078
Caption: it unfortunately so these tips are more

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.679
Caption: about trying to reduce misinterpretation

00:12:06.078 --> 00:12:10.078
Caption: i don&#39;t think you&#39;ll ever will ever be

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:12.398
Caption: able to design a product with no

00:12:10.078 --> 00:12:15.518
Caption: misinterpretation

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:17.278
Caption: to start with there&#39;s just plain bad ui

00:12:15.518 --> 00:12:19.039
Caption: i was filling in a form the other day

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:20.638
Caption: three simple yes no questions that i

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:22.078
Caption: really didn&#39;t want to get wrong but i

00:12:20.638 --> 00:12:23.679
Caption: found it really hard to tell which radio

00:12:22.078 --> 00:12:25.278
Caption: button was yes and which was no and i

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:27.679
Caption: was a little confused and i still don&#39;t

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:29.278
Caption: know i&#39;m assuming i picked yes

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:32.078
Caption: but i&#39;m still not quite sure and that

00:12:29.278 --> 00:12:34.320
Caption: was purely due to bad ui so obviously

00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:37.199
Caption: testing uh your products on and this was

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.638
Caption: on desktop not mobile mobile mobile&#39;s

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.079
Caption: often where the problems are this was

00:12:38.638 --> 00:12:41.838
Caption: desktop

00:12:40.078 --> 00:12:43.599
Caption: so testing your products can avoid most

00:12:41.838 --> 00:12:46.239
Caption: of these simple problems

00:12:43.599 --> 00:12:48.398
Caption: um but i wanted to talk about

00:12:46.239 --> 00:12:50.719
Caption: other issues around misinterpretation of

00:12:48.398 --> 00:12:52.880
Caption: icons so if you have a piece of paper

00:12:50.719 --> 00:12:54.719
Caption: i&#39;d like you to quickly draw whatever

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.760
Caption: first comes to mind for the shapes

00:12:54.719 --> 00:12:57.119
Caption: diamond

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.398
Caption: and cross

00:12:57.119 --> 00:13:00.320
Caption: if you don&#39;t have a piece of paper

00:12:58.398 --> 00:13:01.119
Caption: that&#39;s okay you can just imagine in your

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.760
Caption: head

00:13:01.119 --> 00:13:06.398
Caption: what you would have drawn

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.000
Caption: for those words diamond and cross you

00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:09.838
Caption: can also compare

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.518
Caption: your drawings or answer with the person

00:13:09.838 --> 00:13:13.119
Caption: next to you and see if you&#39;ve got the

00:13:11.518 --> 00:13:15.599
Caption: same thing

00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:16.958
Caption: i&#39;ve run some activities with large

00:13:15.599 --> 00:13:18.838
Caption: groups of people and it&#39;s really

00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:20.958
Caption: interesting that these two really simple

00:13:18.838 --> 00:13:22.479
Caption: words can mean

00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.239
Caption: more than one thing even though you

00:13:22.479 --> 00:13:25.518
Caption: think oh yeah that&#39;s straightforward a

00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:27.278
Caption: diamond

00:13:25.518 --> 00:13:29.119
Caption: should look like

00:13:27.278 --> 00:13:31.838
Caption: this

00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:33.679
Caption: or a diamond should look like

00:13:31.838 --> 00:13:35.919
Caption: this

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:37.679
Caption: or perhaps if you&#39;re a

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:38.799
Caption: young child maybe your diamond looks

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:41.198
Caption: like this

00:13:38.799 --> 00:13:43.679
Caption: that&#39;s from minecraft um

00:13:41.198 --> 00:13:45.039
Caption: for a cross you know maybe if you&#39;re a

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:46.799
Caption: teacher like me you might think of it

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:48.479
Caption: across like that but you could also

00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:50.559
Caption: think of a cross like this

00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:52.958
Caption: or even like this

00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:54.159
Caption: so it&#39;s possible for even very simple

00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:57.119
Caption: things that you think are very

00:13:54.159 --> 00:13:58.398
Caption: straightforward to be misinterpreted

00:13:57.119 --> 00:14:00.398
Caption: to get around

00:13:58.398 --> 00:14:02.320
Caption: this sort of issue the best way is to

00:14:00.398 --> 00:14:05.919
Caption: represent this information in as many

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:08.720
Caption: ways different ways as possible so text

00:14:05.919 --> 00:14:09.518
Caption: visual and audio if possible

00:14:08.719 --> 00:14:11.359
Caption: uh

00:14:09.518 --> 00:14:13.760
Caption: another example as i was playing a game

00:14:11.359 --> 00:14:16.559
Caption: recently and they had used this acronym

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:19.119
Caption: rmb for one of the buttons

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:21.119
Caption: they did explain it at in full at the

00:14:19.119 --> 00:14:23.679
Caption: start but obviously i had not paid

00:14:21.119 --> 00:14:25.760
Caption: proper attention and it kept taking me a

00:14:23.679 --> 00:14:27.838
Caption: few seconds every time i saw this

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:30.880
Caption: acronym to realize what button it was

00:14:27.838 --> 00:14:32.078
Caption: referring to it&#39;s not a common acronym

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.479
Caption: most other

00:14:32.078 --> 00:14:36.799
Caption: games and services i use use this symbol

00:14:34.479 --> 00:14:39.679
Caption: as well alongside and immediately that&#39;s

00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:42.880
Caption: a lot clearer to more users that you&#39;re

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:45.440
Caption: referring to the right mouse button

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.760
Caption: and if possible audio and you know if

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.320
Caption: it&#39;s an audio description of text

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:54.320
Caption: fantastic if it&#39;s not text you could

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.919
Caption: have even audio feedback on an action um

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.679
Caption: to help

00:14:55.919 --> 00:15:01.440
Caption: with interpretation

00:14:57.679 --> 00:15:02.799
Caption: so tips on avoiding misinterpretation is

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.880
Caption: know your audience know where they&#39;re

00:15:02.799 --> 00:15:06.880
Caption: coming from know what they expect to see

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.679
Caption: and use that

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.679
Caption: if you&#39;re not sure use some user testing

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:14.000
Caption: with your target audience even user

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:15.518
Caption: testing on as little as five people

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.198
Caption: can

00:15:15.518 --> 00:15:19.039
Caption: explore and show

00:15:17.198 --> 00:15:21.838
Caption: a lot of basic issues so you can get rid

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:24.559
Caption: of them before releasing a product and

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:26.398
Caption: allow for error recovery which means

00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:28.638
Caption: if users make a mistake which will

00:15:26.398 --> 00:15:30.559
Caption: happen allow them to undo that mistake

00:15:28.638 --> 00:15:33.359
Caption: or ask them if they&#39;re really sure they

00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:36.719
Caption: want to delete that very important file

00:15:33.359 --> 00:15:38.559
Caption: um so with knowing your audience uh

00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:40.479
Caption: this happened in my house the other day

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:42.880
Caption: and to me and to you it might look like

00:15:40.479 --> 00:15:43.758
Caption: a glass of water with some weeds in it

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.198
Caption: um

00:15:43.758 --> 00:15:46.559
Caption: which i was about to throw on the bin

00:15:45.198 --> 00:15:48.078
Caption: but my daughter informed me it was a

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:50.958
Caption: bouquet of flowers she had picked at the

00:15:48.078 --> 00:15:52.838
Caption: park for me and that was the bars so you

00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:54.719
Caption: know know your audience

00:15:52.838 --> 00:15:57.119
Caption: um

00:15:54.719 --> 00:15:59.599
Caption: this symbol appears a lot lately and to

00:15:57.119 --> 00:16:00.958
Caption: me i had just called it the menu icon

00:15:59.599 --> 00:16:03.198
Caption: i&#39;m not sure if you have a different

00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.799
Caption: name for it uh but recently i heard

00:16:03.198 --> 00:16:07.198
Caption: there was another name for it that i had

00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:11.440
Caption: never heard before which was the burger

00:16:07.198 --> 00:16:12.880
Caption: um but what i liked in this particular

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.039
Caption: this is

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.198
Caption: my daughter&#39;s school&#39;s canteen ordering

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:19.198
Caption: system rather than say click the burger

00:16:17.198 --> 00:16:21.518
Caption: icon to order which could be very

00:16:19.198 --> 00:16:24.880
Caption: confusing in this context they said tap

00:16:21.518 --> 00:16:27.198
Caption: here with the symbol to start ordering

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.518
Caption: and the user can actually click on this

00:16:27.198 --> 00:16:32.799
Caption: icon or up in the top left corner so

00:16:29.518 --> 00:16:36.078
Caption: both options are available

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:37.359
Caption: an example of error recovery

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:39.440
Caption: is i

00:16:37.359 --> 00:16:40.239
Caption: can&#39;t remember which service this was

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.919
Caption: but

00:16:40.239 --> 00:16:43.518
Caption: they let users know that even though

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:45.758
Caption: they had scheduled the email for in the

00:16:43.518 --> 00:16:47.838
Caption: future they could still go back and

00:16:45.758 --> 00:16:50.000
Caption: change the email delete or stop the

00:16:47.838 --> 00:16:52.479
Caption: schedule or change the day and time so

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.078
Caption: that even though you&#39;ve you&#39;re about to

00:16:52.479 --> 00:16:55.758
Caption: commit to a large action of sending an

00:16:54.078 --> 00:16:56.559
Caption: email to thousands of people you could

00:16:55.758 --> 00:16:58.159
Caption: still

00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:59.518
Caption: go back and change if you had made a

00:16:58.159 --> 00:17:02.319
Caption: mistake

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:05.119
Caption: so in summary

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:07.280
Caption: for working memory provide users with

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:08.479
Caption: information just in time when it&#39;s

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.919
Caption: meaningful

00:17:08.479 --> 00:17:11.678
Caption: for attention

00:17:09.918 --> 00:17:14.000
Caption: make sure you have information available

00:17:11.678 --> 00:17:15.918
Caption: on demand if it was missed that first

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.119
Caption: time which it most likely will be by

00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:19.599
Caption: somebody

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:21.198
Caption: and give feedback both positive and

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:24.078
Caption: negative feedback or successful and

00:17:21.198 --> 00:17:26.000
Caption: unsuccessful feedback on user actions

00:17:24.078 --> 00:17:28.239
Caption: to try and avoid misinterpretation do

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.918
Caption: some basic user testing with your target

00:17:28.239 --> 00:17:31.038
Caption: audience not your friend in the cubicle

00:17:29.918 --> 00:17:33.519
Caption: next to you

00:17:31.038 --> 00:17:36.479
Caption: and allow for error recovery so at least

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.679
Caption: users don&#39;t feel scared to undertake an

00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:40.000
Caption: action because at least they know they

00:17:37.678 --> 00:17:42.079
Caption: can go back and do it again

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.599
Caption: yeah and so i guess if you only remember

00:17:42.079 --> 00:17:44.959
Caption: one thing tomorrow from this

00:17:43.599 --> 00:17:47.199
Caption: presentation

00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:49.038
Caption: i think celia hodan who is the games

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.839
Caption: user researcher puts it best where she

00:17:49.038 --> 00:17:50.719
Caption: says

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:52.959
Caption: have

00:17:50.719 --> 00:17:54.319
Caption: users learn by doing which i hope is

00:17:52.959 --> 00:17:55.678
Caption: what we have done today through doing

00:17:54.319 --> 00:17:58.399
Caption: those activities

00:17:55.678 --> 00:18:00.719
Caption: in context and with purpose

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.239
Caption: if you&#39;d like to do more reading on how

00:18:00.719 --> 00:18:03.119
Caption: our brains work how we learn and how

00:18:02.239 --> 00:18:05.760
Caption: that

00:18:03.119 --> 00:18:07.359
Caption: crosses over with user design and user

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.280
Caption: experience design

00:18:07.359 --> 00:18:11.119
Caption: these are probably my top three picks

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.640
Caption: for books um

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:14.319
Caption: they even though they might be specific

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.599
Caption: to a certain context a lot of what they

00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:19.199
Caption: write about is very applicable broadly

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:22.160
Caption: in designing of

00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:23.519
Caption: web apps games

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.840
Caption: and

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.200
Caption: are there any questions that&#39;s it thank

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:31.119
Caption: you for listening

00:18:27.199 --> 00:18:34.359
Caption: i hope you learned something and

00:18:31.119 --> 00:18:34.359
Caption: that&#39;s it
