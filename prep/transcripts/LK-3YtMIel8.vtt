Caption: advertise on their job site not just any

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.699
Caption: employer can employers actually have to

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:05.649
Caption: go through a process where they

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:07.440
Caption: demonstrate that they are a diverse

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:09.458
Caption: organization and that they&#39;ve got

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.900
Caption: flexibility and they&#39;ve got culture and

00:03:09.458 --> 00:03:12.759
Caption: they&#39;ve got all these benefits for

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:18.189
Caption: females typically and I think that&#39;s

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:20.768
Caption: awesome the other area is LinkedIn

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.268
Caption: groups and Facebook groups personally

00:03:20.768 --> 00:03:24.789

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:25.929
Caption: that might be showing my age again but

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.399

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:29.199

Caption: referrals or the other main area most

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.739
Caption: companies have great referral programs

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:56.529

00:03:53.738 --> 00:03:58.929
Caption: refer someone and it can be just

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:00.608
Caption: forgotten about so what I want to say is

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:02.378
Caption: you need to be proactive about referrals

00:04:00.608 --> 00:04:04.418

00:04:02.378 --> 00:04:06.309

Caption: the females in your organization and ask

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.380

Caption: use your advert as an opportunity to

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.369
Caption: really call out this benefit it&#39;s your

00:04:57.269 --> 00:05:02.698

Caption: full-time etc the other main points that

00:05:09.688 --> 00:05:15.239

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:17.459
Caption: advertising is criteria all those little

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:19.438
Caption: bullet points every time you put

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:21.299
Caption: criteria on your job advert you&#39;re

00:05:19.438 --> 00:05:24.269
Caption: basically creating it creating an

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:25.829
Caption: objection for someone not to apply so

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:28.138
Caption: think about why you&#39;re putting your

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:30.388
Caption: criteria on your job ad there&#39;s a lot of

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.889
Caption: studies this is one of them that talks

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.050
Caption: about the fact that females are more

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.669
Caption: inclined than men to believe that they

00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:39.000
Caption: need a hundred percent of the job

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.699
Caption: criteria to apply so just be careful of

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.459
Caption: creating those objections think about

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:47.839
Caption: using words like desirable or better yet

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:50.039
Caption: think about not using any criteria why

00:05:47.838 --> 00:05:52.138
Caption: don&#39;t net developer knows what a.net

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.360
Caption: developer needs to have to be successful

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.800
Caption: for the job right so why do we need to

00:05:54.359 --> 00:05:57.959
Caption: put ten bullet points of what they

00:05:55.799 --> 00:06:00.119
Caption: should have it&#39;s just unnecessary

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:02.399
Caption: the job is an opportunity for you to

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:04.229
Caption: sell your organization why should they

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:05.699

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:16.109
Caption: will call it out this was a not-so-great

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:18.869
Caption: example crowded traditional structured

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:20.698
Caption: ad really talks about what you need to

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:25.859
Caption: have and what you need to bring to us

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:29.360
Caption: and if you look at the criteria it has

00:06:25.859 --> 00:06:31.888
Caption: words like deep domain experience

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:34.739

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.559
Caption: name I might be a mouth that has cheese

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:38.609
Caption: of experience I&#39;m sorry to generalize

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:39.339
Caption: but there is going to be a lot of

00:06:38.609 --> 00:06:41.500
Caption: generalizing

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:43.179
Caption: stuff you probably assumed that before

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.829
Caption: you came and listened but there might be

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:46.720
Caption: someone with truth experience and I

00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:49.569
Caption: might think that I know everything about

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.199
Caption: this subject I definitely have extensive

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.419
Caption: experience

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.910

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.919

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.899

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:18.279

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.400

00:09:21.349 --> 00:09:25.279
Caption: making sure that your interview

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.869

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.430
Caption: you end up hurting all the same people

00:09:26.869 --> 00:09:30.229
Caption: obviously you&#39;re going to have a lack of

00:09:28.429 --> 00:09:31.789
Caption: diversity but you also going to have a

00:09:30.229 --> 00:09:34.549
Caption: lack of innovation or like of different

00:09:31.789 --> 00:09:36.769
Caption: ideas alike of different opinions which

00:09:34.549 --> 00:09:38.690
Caption: once again studies back up that diverse

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.369
Caption: organizations are more successful and in

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:45.109
Caption: my experience that&#39;s definitely been the

00:09:40.369 --> 00:09:46.880
Caption: case so in terms of I guess some example

00:09:45.109 --> 00:09:49.489
Caption: questions that you can talk to your

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.049

00:09:55.669 --> 00:10:00.139
Caption: focus and a knowledge sharing ability in

00:09:57.799 --> 00:10:01.519
Caption: their previous roles these are values

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.989
Caption: related questions but they need to be

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.830
Caption: tailored to your organization

00:10:02.989 --> 00:10:08.570
Caption: specifically if your higher values are

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.049
Caption: capabilities specific skills can be

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.369
Caption: trained

00:10:09.049 --> 00:10:12.049
Caption: it doesn&#39;t matter of people and missing

00:10:10.369 --> 00:10:14.390
Caption: a specific skill that&#39;s the easy bit

00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:18.049
Caption: from from my opinion and from my

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:21.710
Caption: experience I want to tell you a brief

00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:24.349
Caption: story about my fabulous recruiter whose

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.000
Caption: actual maternity leave at the moment she

00:10:24.349 --> 00:10:28.009
Caption: applied for a role before coming to us

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.169
Caption: and it was with one of our competitors

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.790
Caption: and she didn&#39;t know what the time and

00:10:30.169 --> 00:10:33.619
Caption: her colleague also applied for the role

00:10:31.789 --> 00:10:36.769
Caption: but she had about six years of

00:10:33.619 --> 00:10:38.839
Caption: experience in IT recruitment he had

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.860
Caption: about the same in recruitment but no IT

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.170
Caption: experience it was in a different

00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:43.640
Caption: industry no she went through need to be

00:10:42.169 --> 00:10:47.959
Caption: processed and the interviewers were all

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:49.489
Caption: male and he got the job over her which

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.260
Caption: was great for me because I was able to

00:10:49.489 --> 00:10:52.940
Caption: hire her about three months later and

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.190
Caption: she&#39;s been amazing and three years down

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.770
Caption: the track it&#39;s you know she smashed it

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:59.239
Caption: but you know I wasn&#39;t a fly on the wall

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.290
Caption: for that interview process so I didn&#39;t

00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:02.058
Caption: know why he got the job

00:11:00.289 --> 00:11:04.698
Caption: her but what I do know is that he only

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:06.739
Caption: lasted about six months and what I also

00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:08.418
Caption: know is that if those interviewers

00:11:06.739 --> 00:11:09.889
Caption: hadn&#39;t been trained on what they&#39;re

00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:11.179
Caption: actually looking for they might have

00:11:09.888 --> 00:11:12.919
Caption: just gotten along with him better and

00:11:11.179 --> 00:11:15.139
Caption: just go halt I&#39;d like to work with him

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:16.458
Caption: we got along I&#39;ll hire him so you need

00:11:15.138 --> 00:11:17.628
Caption: to be really careful because you might

00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:19.688
Caption: not be getting the best people for the

00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:19.689
Caption: job

00:11:19.869 --> 00:11:25.609
Caption: speaking of finding the right coach

00:11:22.068 --> 00:11:27.588
Caption: again there&#39;s some big names up there

00:11:25.609 --> 00:11:28.879
Caption: and you know Cindy companies that I

00:11:27.588 --> 00:11:30.438
Caption: think coming out of the University all

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:33.410
Caption: of us would have been pretty excited to

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:34.939
Caption: dream of working for and there&#39;s a lot

00:11:33.409 --> 00:11:37.728
Caption: of similarities with the core values

00:11:34.939 --> 00:11:40.579
Caption: that you see things like passion respect

00:11:37.729 --> 00:11:43.338
Caption: collaboration quite common and quite

00:11:40.578 --> 00:11:46.539
Caption: popular and definitely the values that

00:11:43.338 --> 00:11:49.458
Caption: are attractive to females specifically

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:51.439
Caption: when I first started in here the first

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:53.719
Caption: thing I did we had 25 people at the time

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:55.910
Caption: so the first thing I did was work with

00:11:53.719 --> 00:11:57.558
Caption: everybody and collaboratively come up

00:11:55.909 --> 00:11:59.388
Caption: with what we wanted our culture to be

00:11:57.559 --> 00:12:01.639
Caption: and what we wanted our core values to be

00:11:59.388 --> 00:12:03.258
Caption: and this meant that everyone was bought

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:05.419
Caption: into it because one person doesn&#39;t

00:12:03.258 --> 00:12:07.849
Caption: create your culture every single person

00:12:05.419 --> 00:12:10.160
Caption: your business creates your culture so I

00:12:07.849 --> 00:12:12.318
Caption: ask people you know - we have some

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:13.909
Caption: brainstorming sessions and everyone

00:12:12.318 --> 00:12:16.398
Caption: everyone has different styles so you

00:12:13.909 --> 00:12:17.748
Caption: need to be careful of being inclusive so

00:12:16.398 --> 00:12:19.338
Caption: I asked people if they wanted to send me

00:12:17.749 --> 00:12:21.319
Caption: images or pictures or if they wanted to

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:23.328
Caption: send me words whatever worked for them

00:12:21.318 --> 00:12:25.068
Caption: you know just give me hits some

00:12:23.328 --> 00:12:27.648
Caption: information some snapshots of what you

00:12:25.068 --> 00:12:30.278
Caption: want our culture to look like in six

00:12:27.648 --> 00:12:33.109
Caption: months time or one year&#39;s time or today

00:12:30.278 --> 00:12:34.698

Caption: was fantastic we came up with his five

00:12:34.698 --> 00:12:40.398
Caption: core values everyone was aligned to them

00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:42.559
Caption: everybody was bought in and then it&#39;s

00:12:40.398 --> 00:12:44.268
Caption: the behavior that your reward that will

00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:46.789
Caption: drive that culture forward it doesn&#39;t

00:12:44.268 --> 00:12:50.088
Caption: just you know happen without any effort

00:12:46.789 --> 00:12:52.638
Caption: so the next step was creating a living

00:12:50.088 --> 00:12:54.318
Caption: the values awards program and that

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:56.238
Caption: awards program I&#39;m pretty proud to say

00:12:54.318 --> 00:12:57.918
Caption: it&#39;s still running five years later at a

00:12:56.239 --> 00:13:01.069
Caption: hundred and twenty people and it&#39;s still

00:12:57.919 --> 00:13:02.720
Caption: as everyone&#39;s as engaged as ever so

00:13:01.068 --> 00:13:04.818
Caption: every month people can nominate each

00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:07.909
Caption: other they can nominate P

00:13:04.818 --> 00:13:09.888
Caption: managers can nominate people whoever and

00:13:07.909 --> 00:13:11.988
Caption: then we chew and they talk about what

00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:13.458
Caption: value their nominating them for and how

00:13:11.989 --> 00:13:15.769
Caption: they display those behaviors what

00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:17.388
Caption: they&#39;ve done and then each month we

00:13:15.768 --> 00:13:19.669
Caption: choose two people that get a prize and

00:13:17.388 --> 00:13:21.818
Caption: we promote the hell out of it on our

00:13:19.669 --> 00:13:24.439
Caption: newsletters and on our internal systems

00:13:21.818 --> 00:13:26.328
Caption: and also on our recognition programs as

00:13:24.439 --> 00:13:29.299
Caption: well and it&#39;s been really successful

00:13:26.328 --> 00:13:33.229
Caption: over the last five years the other thing

00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:35.859
Caption: that we created about two years ago was

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:39.349
Caption: we implemented a recognition program and

00:13:35.859 --> 00:13:41.328
Caption: that just organically absolutely took

00:13:39.349 --> 00:13:42.918
Caption: off on its own and I think it&#39;s because

00:13:41.328 --> 00:13:45.409
Caption: we already had the foundation of the

00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:46.999
Caption: culture around rewarding each other and

00:13:45.409 --> 00:13:49.849
Caption: celebrating each other and thanking each

00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:51.769
Caption: other if anyone hasn&#39;t seen it it&#39;s a

00:13:49.849 --> 00:13:54.018
Caption: program called ready and if anyone

00:13:51.768 --> 00:13:56.868
Caption: watches the shark tank it&#39;s no missiles

00:13:54.018 --> 00:13:59.838
Caption: red balloon day business and it&#39;s

00:13:56.869 --> 00:14:02.119
Caption: basically a program where we allocate

00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:04.248
Caption: points every quarter to all of our staff

00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:06.319
Caption: so you don&#39;t just have to be a manager

00:14:04.249 --> 00:14:08.299
Caption: to be able to recognize and you know

00:14:06.318 --> 00:14:10.068
Caption: give points to people you can just do it

00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:12.319
Caption: peer-to-peer and those points can be

00:14:10.068 --> 00:14:14.658
Caption: traded in for things on the red balloon

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:16.668

Caption: for us bought some really cool

Caption: headphones so you know you actually get

00:14:27.049 --> 00:14:30.889
Caption: a story out of what people are using

00:14:28.638 --> 00:14:32.778
Caption: their points for as well and then you&#39;ve

00:14:30.888 --> 00:14:34.969
Caption: got a recognition wall that calls out

00:14:32.778 --> 00:14:36.169
Caption: all of these stories of how people are

00:14:34.969 --> 00:14:38.628
Caption: thanking each other and how they&#39;re

00:14:36.169 --> 00:14:40.759
Caption: helping each other and it just really

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:44.720
Caption: helps reinforce those behaviors again

00:14:40.758 --> 00:14:46.518
Caption: and drive the culture do you want to

00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:48.458

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:51.919
Caption: with the right values in the first place

00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:54.678
Caption: everything else is a lot easier and the

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:56.509
Caption: other thing I want to reiterate is to be

00:14:54.679 --> 00:14:58.100
Caption: transparent and call out behavior that&#39;s

00:14:56.508 --> 00:15:00.918
Caption: not in line with your values you know

00:14:58.099 --> 00:15:03.138
Caption: don&#39;t be afraid to call it out and to

00:15:00.919 --> 00:15:04.850
Caption: say you know that wasn&#39;t in line with

00:15:03.138 --> 00:15:07.518
Caption: our values I don&#39;t want to see that

00:15:04.849 --> 00:15:09.378
Caption: behavior again just be transparent about

00:15:07.518 --> 00:15:12.849
Caption: it and if you do that it will continue

00:15:09.379 --> 00:15:12.850
Caption: to keep driving that&#39;s right behaviour

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:16.980
Caption: flexibility it feeds into culture as

00:15:15.979 --> 00:15:19.619
Caption: well

00:15:16.979 --> 00:15:23.219
Caption: for females it&#39;s important to have a

00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:24.898
Caption: flexible culture and once again I&#39;m not

00:15:23.219 --> 00:15:26.369
Caption: just saying that this is for females

00:15:24.898 --> 00:15:27.929
Caption: only and not for males because we

00:15:26.369 --> 00:15:30.059
Caption: actually have quite a few males in our

00:15:27.929 --> 00:15:32.219
Caption: organization that do after school pick

00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:34.469
Caption: up a forcible pica if the kids are sick

00:15:32.219 --> 00:15:36.479
Caption: they stay home with the kids but the

00:15:34.469 --> 00:15:39.059
Caption: stats are still that females are doing

00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:40.979
Caption: about 70% of it so it is more important

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:42.570
Caption: for females and you do need to really

00:15:40.979 --> 00:15:45.898
Caption: promote it if you want to attract more

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:48.119
Caption: and retain more females you know the

00:15:45.898 --> 00:15:50.578
Caption: days of working nine to five eight two

00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:53.010
Caption: six nine to nine whatever it is they&#39;re

00:15:50.578 --> 00:15:54.599
Caption: gone in the tech industry and more so

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.309
Caption: than ever with cloud access we should

00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:58.049
Caption: have flexibility to work however and

00:15:56.309 --> 00:16:01.169
Caption: whenever we want and be empowered to do

00:15:58.049 --> 00:16:03.119
Caption: that and it&#39;s so important that people

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:06.208
Caption: can do that and work from home when they

00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:08.070
Caption: need to some examples is that we had a

00:16:06.208 --> 00:16:10.588
Caption: staff member who used to do three days

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:11.669
Caption: from work in three thousand office and

00:16:10.588 --> 00:16:14.309
Caption: two days from home for child care

00:16:11.669 --> 00:16:16.768
Caption: purposes we have another female recently

00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:18.929
Caption: who asked to work you know three days

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:20.518
Caption: from the office and then take two days

00:16:18.929 --> 00:16:22.578
Caption: to move to a part-time role look if she

00:16:20.518 --> 00:16:25.289
Caption: wanted to study Andrea interior design

00:16:22.578 --> 00:16:26.190
Caption: why not why not support these things

00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:28.708
Caption: what&#39;s the downside

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:31.440
Caption: I would argue that you get so much more

00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:33.448
Caption: and loyalty and work ethic from people

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.638
Caption: if you do have this flexible culture and

00:16:33.448 --> 00:16:36.929
Caption: if you are helping people pursue

00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:40.768
Caption: whatever they want to pursue up funds

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:43.318
Caption: work when I first started I dig near my

00:16:40.768 --> 00:16:45.448
Caption: CEO I had had a few bad experiences and

00:16:43.318 --> 00:16:47.489
Caption: he had a blanket rule no one can work

00:16:45.448 --> 00:16:49.619
Caption: from home he was so against working from

00:16:47.489 --> 00:16:51.750
Caption: home I&#39;m sorry unless you were part of

00:16:49.619 --> 00:16:53.789
Caption: the senior management team of three and

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.989
Caption: then it was behind but no one else was

00:16:53.789 --> 00:16:57.119
Caption: allowed to work from home and that

00:16:54.989 --> 00:17:00.059
Caption: really fed into a negative culture

00:16:57.119 --> 00:17:01.559
Caption: because of the lack of trust so I worked

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:03.719
Caption: with him really closely around managing

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:05.338
Caption: by exception you know don&#39;t let a couple

00:17:03.719 --> 00:17:06.958
Caption: of people that are doing the wrong thing

00:17:05.338 --> 00:17:09.510
Caption: ruin it for everyone and ruin your

00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:10.828
Caption: entire culture during the afraid to have

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.119
Caption: those difficult conversations with

00:17:10.828 --> 00:17:14.729
Caption: people that are not doing the right

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:17.160
Caption: thing so we changed that straightaway

00:17:14.729 --> 00:17:19.650
Caption: and the difference in the culture you

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.989
Caption: know was ridiculous it straightaway

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.729
Caption: moved to a culture of trust and move to

00:17:21.989 --> 00:17:27.109
Caption: a culture of managing transparently

00:17:23.729 --> 00:17:27.109
Caption: negative behaviors

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:32.839
Caption: transfer of processes is something that

00:17:30.079 --> 00:17:36.199
Caption: I&#39;m also really passionate about about

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:38.479
Caption: everything but it&#39;s so so important in

00:17:36.199 --> 00:17:41.419
Caption: attraction and retention and once again

00:17:38.479 --> 00:17:43.160
Caption: for everyone for males and females but

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.590
Caption: certainly for females there&#39;s a lot of

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.170
Caption: stats that say that females are less

00:17:45.589 --> 00:17:50.029
Caption: inclined to ask for salary increases to

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.920
Caption: put their hand up and say I deserve a

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.560
Caption: promotion give me a promotion

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.260
Caption: they&#39;re just less inclined to do that so

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.910
Caption: we need to be proactive about creating

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.250
Caption: really objective fair transparent

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:04.849
Caption: processes so that it&#39;s easy for them to

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:06.680
Caption: have those conversations with you one of

00:18:04.849 --> 00:18:08.689
Caption: the projects that I&#39;ve axon edenia was

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.260
Caption: creating really clear career pathways

00:18:08.689 --> 00:18:14.209
Caption: that mapped into a capability framework

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:16.130
Caption: that was completely objective so you

00:18:14.209 --> 00:18:17.659
Caption: could see okay here&#39;s a promotion

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:20.060
Caption: whitebook these are the capabilities

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:22.430
Caption: that I need to give examples of to be

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:24.320
Caption: able to progress to the next role and it

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:30.410
Caption: just changes the conversation instead of

00:18:24.319 --> 00:18:33.259
Caption: a semi having instead of a semi having

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:35.300
Caption: to say I deserve that promotion they can

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.829
Caption: say you know what I&#39;ve been working out

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.470
Caption: I&#39;ve been working through this promotion

00:18:36.829 --> 00:18:41.119
Caption: workbook and I meet all of this criteria

00:18:39.469 --> 00:18:42.140
Caption: here&#39;s some here&#39;s here&#39;s the examples

00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:44.209
Caption: do you think that I&#39;m ready for a

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:46.070
Caption: promotion it just makes the conversation

00:18:44.209 --> 00:18:49.849
Caption: a lot softer and a lot easier for a

00:18:46.069 --> 00:18:51.709
Caption: female to have the other thing that I

00:18:49.849 --> 00:18:53.809
Caption: was actually quite excited about with

00:18:51.709 --> 00:18:55.880
Caption: the inside acquisition of igni and 12

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:58.160
Caption: months ago is that insight have transfer

00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.319
Caption: of salary bands and once again it&#39;s

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.450
Caption: about making the conversations easier

00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:05.000
Caption: for females to have with their manager

00:19:02.449 --> 00:19:06.619
Caption: so by having a transfer at salary band

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.420
Caption: it means that you can have a

00:19:06.619 --> 00:19:09.739
Caption: conversation about all this is the

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.840
Caption: minimum this is the maximum this is

00:19:09.739 --> 00:19:14.540
Caption: where you sit on the band and I figure I

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:16.369
Caption: can say well I&#39;ve got this many years of

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.500
Caption: experience and I guess compared to the

00:19:16.369 --> 00:19:20.059
Caption: other people in my team this is where I

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.770
Caption: think I&#39;d probably sit on the band but

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.750
Caption: I&#39;m only here is there a reason for that

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:26.390
Caption: just makes the conversation softer and

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:28.750
Caption: easier to have and in my experience it&#39;s

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:32.150
Caption: made a really big difference

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:34.250
Caption: so getting like people go to great

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.770
Caption: culture we&#39;ve got transparent processes

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:41.050
Caption: then you need to promote the hell out of

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:43.130
Caption: it employer branding

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.820
Caption: sponsorship getting involved in things

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:47.060
Caption: like this

00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:49.130
Caption: sponsoring things that you know health

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.080
Caption: of the IT community but also sponsoring

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:53.479
Caption: programs that are targeted at females as

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:56.479
Caption: well I talked about some of the groups

00:19:53.479 --> 00:19:57.949
Caption: earlier we were ACS women check those of

00:19:56.479 --> 00:20:01.250

Caption: sponsoring and even bet on volunteering

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.280
Caption: and getting involved in them it shows

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:08.839
Caption: that you practice what you preach it

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.210
Caption: shows that you actually care about

00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:13.189
Caption: diversity and that you genuinely do want

00:20:11.209 --> 00:20:15.520
Caption: to help more females get into the

00:20:13.189 --> 00:20:19.369
Caption: industry and stay in the industry

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:21.800

00:20:46.609 --> 00:20:51.229
Caption: involved to be on committees you know

00:20:48.349 --> 00:20:52.729

00:20:52.729 --> 00:20:56.660
Caption: reflect on your organization give them

Caption: for my organization but if you can you

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.109
Caption: know give people time to be involved in

00:21:01.819 --> 00:21:06.439
Caption: that sort of stuff because you&#39;ll get it

00:21:03.109 --> 00:21:08.000
Caption: back tenfold meetups as well I know a

00:21:06.439 --> 00:21:09.469

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Caption: involved in user groups and meetup

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:14.030
Caption: groups and they&#39;re absolutely fantastic

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.489
Caption: for that networking internships

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:18.440

00:21:16.489 --> 00:21:20.119

Caption: we got another eight and that was super

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.739
Caption: exciting and I think there&#39;s the

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.969
Caption: difference in the response rate of

00:21:35.739 --> 00:21:39.469
Caption: headhunting and in males when we have

00:21:37.969 --> 00:21:42.049

Caption: award with over 20 percent increase in

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:46.340
Caption: the response rate which is crazy just

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:49.700

00:31:13.819 --> 00:31:20.509

00:31:16.489 --> 00:31:22.339

00:31:29.229 --> 00:31:32.989
Caption: someone threw out a little assumption

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.670
Caption: that I was going to take the minutes

00:31:32.989 --> 00:31:36.290
Caption: because you know that was there any

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:38.660
Caption: female right so who else would take me

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:40.250
Caption: that and he saw the look on my face and

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:42.470
Caption: he jumped in and was like it&#39;s all good

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:43.849

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:53.420

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:56.000
Caption: whatever things you need to educate

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:57.890
Caption: everybody on understanding that because

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.680
Caption: it will be a different organization if

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:03.979
Caption: people are aware of it same thing with

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:06.530
Caption: coffee right no one no one even tries

00:32:03.979 --> 00:32:09.049
Caption: that I don&#39;t know it happens all the

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:11.150
Caption: time um and also perception around now

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:12.680
Caption: versus female you know sometimes it&#39;s

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.119

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.590
Caption: with interrupting or with being a little

00:32:14.119 --> 00:32:18.170

00:32:15.589 --> 00:32:20.329

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:22.190
Caption: around the perception and it&#39;s all an

00:32:20.329 --> 00:32:24.049
Caption: education process it&#39;s just making sure

00:32:22.189 --> 00:32:26.089
Caption: people are aware of these things and the

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:27.560
Caption: thought processes that happen without

00:32:26.089 --> 00:32:30.229

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:32.270

00:32:30.229 --> 00:32:36.589

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:39.140

Caption: and there was 35 women and there was

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.670
Caption: three men but came which is great

00:32:46.079 --> 00:32:49.919
Caption: because we like men to come to those

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:52.650
Caption: events and everyone was looking for a

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.180

Caption: little bit kind of sarcastic and awkward

00:32:56.699 --> 00:33:01.079

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:04.469

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:06.510
Caption: here said it&#39;s to everybody

00:33:04.469 --> 00:33:09.329
Caption: guys I just want you to think for a

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:12.690
Caption: moment about how you feel right now how

00:33:09.329 --> 00:33:15.359
Caption: it feels to be the minority and how it

00:33:12.689 --> 00:33:18.000
Caption: feels to be the only man and this big

00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:19.920
Caption: group of females and I want you to think

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.069
Caption: and just reflect for a moment on that

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.630
Caption: feeling of uncomfortableness and then I

00:33:23.069 --> 00:33:27.139
Caption: want you to think that that&#39;s how most

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:31.500
Caption: of us working and I t feel every day

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:33.329
Caption: we&#39;re the one female in the 30 miles and

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.760
Caption: I just thought that was like

00:33:33.329 --> 00:33:38.130
Caption: mind-blowing like it&#39;s so obvious but

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:41.099
Caption: until you reflect to think about it it

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:42.989
Caption: doesn&#39;t really sink in so cool people

00:33:41.099 --> 00:33:46.770
Caption: out it doesn&#39;t have to be in a negative

00:33:42.989 --> 00:33:49.079
Caption: way but call them out oh those little

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:50.640
Caption: snapshot up there of Sheryl Sandberg

00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:51.449
Caption: because I really love her for cleaning I

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.339
Caption: don&#39;t know it was a little bit

00:33:51.449 --> 00:33:56.279
Caption: controversial because she really puts a

00:33:53.339 --> 00:33:59.880
Caption: lot of onus on females to step up and to

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:01.200
Caption: be more proactive which I agree with but

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.839
Caption: I think she also gives some really good

00:34:01.199 --> 00:34:05.639
Caption: perspectives for men so I think for

00:34:03.839 --> 00:34:06.959
Caption: those an females it&#39;s a great book to

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.689
Caption: read and just gives you some really

00:34:06.959 --> 00:34:11.280
Caption: interesting perspective on some of the

00:34:09.689 --> 00:34:14.158
Caption: things females go through that you just

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.739
Caption: wouldn&#39;t think about and I guess the

00:34:14.158 --> 00:34:18.239
Caption: final thing I want to talk about is

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:22.139
Caption: people don&#39;t leave companies they leave

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:24.000
Caption: managers right so um you know it&#39;s all

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:24.629
Caption: about the leadership leaders need to be

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.729
Caption: proactive

00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:29.009
Caption: you know Isis leaders need to step up

00:34:26.729 --> 00:34:31.260
Caption: and we need to see the ones that

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:32.760
Caption: proactively encourage females if they&#39;re

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.668
Caption: not looking at the promotion processes

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:38.639
Caption: why aren&#39;t they we need to be really

00:34:35.668 --> 00:34:40.168
Caption: proactive communication styles you know

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:41.849
Caption: making sure that if you&#39;re having you&#39;re

00:34:40.168 --> 00:34:43.709
Caption: running a you know a boardroom meeting

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:45.750
Caption: and you&#39;ve got females that aren&#39;t

00:34:43.709 --> 00:34:47.280
Caption: speaking up make the effort and ask them

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:49.320
Caption: you know do you have anything that you

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:51.820
Caption: would like to input what do you think

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.260
Caption: about that kind of thing

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:55.959
Caption: my name right now but what are you

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:57.880
Caption: thinking about that um be proactive as a

00:34:55.959 --> 00:35:00.070
Caption: leader you know they&#39;re like see that&#39;s

00:34:57.879 --> 00:35:01.479
Caption: that&#39;s your job to to step up and to

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:04.150
Caption: play that role and be really proactive

00:35:01.479 --> 00:35:06.010
Caption: as a mouth leader making sure that

00:35:04.149 --> 00:35:10.089
Caption: you&#39;ve got that you&#39;re giving fair face

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:11.979
Caption: time you know it&#39;s easy to assume that

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:14.290
Caption: you know females might not might not

00:35:11.979 --> 00:35:15.040
Caption: want to go out for a beer after work why

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.330
Caption: wouldn&#39;t they

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.890
Caption: you need to make sure you&#39;re being

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.930
Caption: inclusive and that you&#39;re allowing

00:35:17.889 --> 00:35:21.729
Caption: females to have the same rapport

00:35:19.929 --> 00:35:23.919
Caption: building time and the same face time

00:35:21.729 --> 00:35:28.629
Caption: with you that then male colleagues are

00:35:23.919 --> 00:35:30.099
Caption: so so important and female leaders as

00:35:28.629 --> 00:35:33.219
Caption: well we need to be really careful

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:35.890
Caption: because females are terrible at

00:35:33.219 --> 00:35:37.570
Caption: comparing each other to other females so

00:35:35.889 --> 00:35:39.760
Caption: you know I&#39;ve been on both sides of the

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:41.410
Caption: coin where I&#39;ve had a female manager who

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.449
Caption: definitely held me to a higher

00:35:41.409 --> 00:35:45.339
Caption: expectation than my male colleague and

00:35:43.449 --> 00:35:47.889
Caption: as a female I catch myself doing it as

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:51.000
Caption: well so you know we need to be my

00:35:47.889 --> 00:35:52.959
Caption: leaders be really conscious about that

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.060
Caption: and I&#39;d like to finish through the

00:35:52.959 --> 00:35:57.010
Caption: practice what you preach certainly

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:58.510
Caption: throughout the interview process you

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.889
Caption: know be being open and honest and

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.030
Caption: transparent because when people join

00:35:59.889 --> 00:36:03.309
Caption: your company they&#39;re going to find out

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:05.679
Caption: everything so you need to gain that

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:07.449
Caption: loyalty because this people can go work

00:36:05.679 --> 00:36:09.129
Caption: anywhere especially in Perth ride you

00:36:07.449 --> 00:36:11.589
Caption: can get another job tomorrow in about

00:36:09.129 --> 00:36:13.179
Caption: ten places so if you want to retain the

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:15.969
Caption: loyalty practice what you preach the

00:36:13.179 --> 00:36:17.479
Caption: whole way through and you will so thank
