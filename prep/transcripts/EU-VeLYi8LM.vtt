00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.920

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.760

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.479

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.039

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:54.558
Caption: cloudy type problems that&#39;s what i do in

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.719
Caption: my day job if you want to know more

00:00:54.558 --> 00:00:58.639
Caption: about that you can ask me more

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.640
Caption: but the reason that i&#39;m here speaking to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:02.799
Caption: all of you today is because i am an

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.639
Caption: accidental accessibility advocate we&#39;re

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.559
Caption: going to get back to that one

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:08.639
Caption: as hannah said outside work i am an

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:10.319
Caption: occasional author and kitchen alchemist

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:12.959
Caption: sometimes that ends really well

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:15.439
Caption: sometimes doesn&#39;t i am also a raging

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:18.158
Caption: sportsball fan hence that picture and

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.200
Caption: this being me in boston bruins clothing

00:01:18.158 --> 00:01:24.000
Caption: that&#39;s a hockey team for the record

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:24.798
Caption: so the accidental accessibility advocate

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.959
Caption: bit

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.320
Caption: the last two words of that are very easy

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:30.720
Caption: to understand

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:33.839
Caption: the accidental is a bit less so and in

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.159
Caption: order to explain that i need to take you

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:38.000
Caption: on a little bit of a tour

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:40.478
Caption: and we are going to start that tour in

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.680
Caption: the uk with this excellent disabled

00:01:40.478 --> 00:01:45.118
Caption: toilet which is down the set of stairs

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.879
Caption: i don&#39;t know if any of you have ever

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.479
Caption: tried to take a wheelchair down a set of

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:50.478
Caption: stairs do not recommend

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:54.478
Caption: over in new zealand much closer to home

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:56.720
Caption: we do actually have a ramp to be able to

00:01:54.478 --> 00:01:58.319
Caption: get into this building but unfortunately

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.239
Caption: for the poor power chair user who&#39;s

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.919
Caption: currently sitting and staring at it it

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:04.398
Caption: is blocked off by a couple of large

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:06.959
Caption: orange traffic cones again if you want

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.679
Caption: to get into the building not absolutely

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.958
Caption: conducive to that

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.559
Caption: and finally

00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.639
Caption: the place where i could save this talk

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:17.759
Caption: in the place where i live in melbourne

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:20.878
Caption: we have these exolus around the place

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:22.559
Caption: space age public toilets if you will

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:24.319
Caption: and the reason why

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:26.958
Caption: these made it into a talk about

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.800
Caption: accidental accessibility advocacy

00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.319
Caption: is because they have a cleaning cycle

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.559
Caption: which runs

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.000
Caption: and that is indicated by a large light

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:35.199
Caption: which will go on in the cubicle of the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.039
Caption: toilet

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.800
Caption: there is also a panel in the toilet

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.479
Caption: which explains that when the large light

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.639
Caption: goes on you should vacate because it&#39;s

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:46.800
Caption: about to start its cleaning cycle

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.800
Caption: that panel is translated into braille

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:49.679
Caption: braille

00:02:48.238 --> 00:02:51.039
Caption: blind people

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:54.799
Caption: light

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:56.399
Caption: doesn&#39;t quite compute there

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.958
Caption: so

00:02:56.399 --> 00:03:00.319
Caption: before i get on let&#39;s define a few

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.518
Caption: important terms

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.958
Caption: to begin with

00:03:01.518 --> 00:03:04.639
Caption: disability

00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:06.399
Caption: by the australian definition is a

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.158
Caption: continuing condition which restricts

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:10.479
Caption: everyday activities

00:03:08.158 --> 00:03:12.559
Caption: a continuing condition means that it&#39;s

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:14.559
Caption: likely to last for six months or more

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:17.199
Caption: the restricting everyday activities bit

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:19.039
Caption: is fairly self-explanatory

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.958
Caption: then there&#39;s accessibility and that&#39;s

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.639
Caption: the degree to which an activity can be

00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:25.679
Caption: done by everyone

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:28.000
Caption: now this is not just about disability

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:30.479
Caption: one case study that i like to use here

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.279
Caption: is from about december 2009 if anyone

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.958
Caption: remembers hp&#39;s racist webcam where a

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:37.839
Caption: black gentleman had gone out and bought

00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:39.759
Caption: himself a state-of-the-art hp laptop

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:41.279
Caption: which had a wonderful web camera which

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:43.759
Caption: was supposed to be able to do facial

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:46.958
Caption: recognition except it couldn&#39;t until he

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:49.199
Caption: got his white co-worker to test it

00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:51.119
Caption: and then there&#39;s adaptive technology and

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:53.279
Caption: those are tools that disable people to

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:56.479
Caption: use to improve access

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:59.119
Caption: that can be exceptionally low tech this

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:01.518
Caption: my walking stick is a piece of adaptive

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:03.839
Caption: technology wheelchairs are adaptive

00:04:01.518 --> 00:04:05.759
Caption: technology some things that we use in

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:08.000
Caption: architecture like ramps can be part of

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:10.238
Caption: adaptive technology

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.479
Caption: but in the broader sense in terms of

00:04:10.238 --> 00:04:14.000
Caption: technical pieces of adaptive technology

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:16.079
Caption: we&#39;re talking here about things like

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.479
Caption: screen readers things like adaptive and

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.040
Caption: augmentative communication things which

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.199
Caption: are essentially attached to a computer

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.240
Caption: and warning this is where we get

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.239
Caption: political for a minute

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.160
Caption: excuse me

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.399
Caption: as i get back to the right slide

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.399
Caption: there are broadly two different ways

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:39.119
Caption: that we can define disability

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:41.040
Caption: the medical model and the social model

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:43.600
Caption: the medical model of disability holds

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.119
Caption: that disability itself is a problem that

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.880
Caption: disability is something that we should

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:49.279
Caption: try to resolve something that we should

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.040
Caption: try to cure and that is illustrated here

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.479
Caption: by this uh clip-up blob in a wheelchair

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.119
Caption: being comforted by a vaguely

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.279
Caption: doctor-looking clip-art blog

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:59.199
Caption: on the other hand the social model holds

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:01.519
Caption: that it&#39;s not so much disability that&#39;s

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.520
Caption: the problem it&#39;s accessibility that we

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:04.959
Caption: shouldn&#39;t be trying to change people we

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:06.319
Caption: should be trying to change the world

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:09.039
Caption: around them to make it easier to

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.720
Caption: navigate and when that goes well that&#39;s

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.039
Caption: illustrated by things like adaptive

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.639
Caption: sports that we have over here you know

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.759
Caption: these people who are playing sports in

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.199
Caption: wheelchairs look perfectly happy doing

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.119
Caption: and i wouldn&#39;t want to dismiss the

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.880
Caption: medical model entirely because there are

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:25.119
Caption: some great interventions that have come

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.199
Caption: out of that but for the purposes of the

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:28.720
Caption: work that we&#39;re doing the way that i

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.959
Caption: would suggest that we look at this is

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.679
Caption: through the lens of the social model we

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:36.638
Caption: want to try to modify the environment to

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:38.479
Caption: make it easier for people to use

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.399
Caption: and if you&#39;re here i feel pretty

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.080
Caption: confident in saying that this is part of

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:43.919
Caption: your job

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:46.079
Caption: so to illustrate that let&#39;s look at a

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.240
Caption: few case studies of how this goes well

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:50.879
Caption: and how this goes badly

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:53.199
Caption: this is onggren.net and i didn&#39;t have to

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.000
Caption: look very hard to find this it&#39;s on a

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.119
Caption: great many list of top 10 worst websites

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.679
Caption: ever

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:01.440
Caption: and it&#39;s visually very cluttered you can

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:03.600
Caption: see that i mean it would probably make

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.600
Caption: more sense to me if i spoke norwegian

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.440
Caption: but you&#39;ve got a bunch of pictures here

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.199
Caption: which are all very confused you&#39;ve got a

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.039
Caption: bunch of colors there&#39;s not really a

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.199
Caption: whole lot of structure to it

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.440
Caption: and it would not surprise you that if

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.360
Caption: you try to navigate on grand.net with a

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.440
Caption: screen reader you&#39;re going to have a

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:21.679
Caption: great deal of difficulty doing it

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.679
Caption: because that structure that&#39;s replicated

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:25.600
Caption: that structure that we see here visually

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:27.199
Caption: is replicated in the lack of structure

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.440
Caption: that you get when trying to navigate it

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.600
Caption: with a screen reader there&#39;s a hell of a

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.399
Caption: lot of red and green here and that&#39;s

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.399
Caption: really difficult for colorblind people

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:38.639
Caption: unsurprisingly many of the images here

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:41.199
Caption: don&#39;t actually have alt text and it&#39;s

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.800
Caption: also not clear which images are tied to

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.959
Caption: which links because of the lack of

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:47.119
Caption: structure

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:49.279
Caption: and then there&#39;s distinctive design

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:51.759
Caption: this is ling&#39;s cars and you may or may

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:54.000
Caption: not believe this but this is actually

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:56.479
Caption: one of the most successful car leasing

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.639
Caption: businesses in the united kingdom

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:01.759
Caption: and it is built around the brand of link

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.880
Caption: valentine the owner and the brand is

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:06.080
Caption: obvious

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.239
Caption: ling&#39;s face is animated the uh tongue

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:10.079
Caption: with british flag on it is animated the

00:07:08.239 --> 00:07:11.598
Caption: traffic lights are animated and my

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:13.598
Caption: favorite bit which i couldn&#39;t get into

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:16.559
Caption: this screenshot from when i originally

00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:18.799
Caption: took it was the gif of boris johnson

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:22.239
Caption: shrugging used to illustrate the boris

00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:24.478
Caption: brexit guarantee that if the uk left the

Caption: eu the cost of leasing your car would

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.399
Caption: not go up

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:30.319
Caption: but if you want to build a distinctive

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:32.799
Caption: website like this there are a lot of

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:35.359
Caption: considerations that go into it

00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:37.119
Caption: you have to think about things like that

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:39.918
Caption: text across the top

00:07:37.119 --> 00:07:41.598
Caption: that&#39;s not text that&#39;s actually clip art

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:43.279
Caption: so it&#39;s not necessarily going to be

00:07:41.598 --> 00:07:45.759
Caption: immediately apparent that that&#39;s the

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:48.479
Caption: launching point of your page and you

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:50.319
Caption: also need to then add alt text to it you

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:52.080
Caption: can have issues with backgrounds making

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.279
Caption: it difficult for people to navigate

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:55.519
Caption: things

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:57.199
Caption: you know there is a lot of alt text that

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:58.799
Caption: has gone into this website but when i

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:00.080
Caption: originally looked at it there wasn&#39;t a

00:07:58.799 --> 00:08:01.759
Caption: lot of it there there were a lot of

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:03.198
Caption: scenarios where pictures were used to

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:04.799
Caption: illustrate things

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:06.639
Caption: without something that would be backed

00:08:04.799 --> 00:08:09.039
Caption: up by a screen reader and if you have

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:10.960
Caption: photo photo sensitivity problems you are

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:13.199
Caption: not going to have fun trying to navigate

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:14.959
Caption: this site

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:16.639
Caption: then there&#39;s an example of good design

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:19.839
Caption: and this is one that probably a lot of

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:22.559
Caption: us use every day and that is github

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:24.799
Caption: github does a few things really well

00:08:22.559 --> 00:08:26.878
Caption: that are not necessarily intuitive to

00:08:24.799 --> 00:08:28.799
Caption: start with if you look at that top bar

00:08:26.878 --> 00:08:31.279
Caption: over there you can see that you&#39;ve got

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:33.359
Caption: the github logo the search bar but then

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:36.080
Caption: next to it you&#39;ve actually got pull

00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:38.559
Caption: requests issues marketplace explore and

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.360
Caption: those are easy anchors for screen reader

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:44.080
Caption: users to be able to get to the areas of

00:08:41.359 --> 00:08:46.640
Caption: github that they might frequently use

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.959
Caption: github is very very good about not just

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.880
Caption: conveying information with color the

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:53.359
Caption: layout is quite easy to understand

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.359
Caption: visually it scales very well

00:08:53.359 --> 00:08:57.919
Caption: and this is actually a screenshot of the

00:08:55.359 --> 00:09:00.159
Caption: nvda repo the free and open source

00:08:57.919 --> 00:09:03.119
Caption: screen reader for windows and the people

00:09:00.159 --> 00:09:05.199
Caption: who developed nvda migrated it over to

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:06.239
Caption: github because they found that for their

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.080
Caption: users

00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:10.719
Caption: the vast majority of whom are screen

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:14.000
Caption: reader users github was a very easy way

00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:14.000
Caption: for them to submit bugs

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.958
Caption: if you want to do this well there are a

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:20.958
Caption: bunch of resources for it

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:23.278
Caption: the web content accessibility guides are

00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:25.838
Caption: sort of the canonical resource

00:09:23.278 --> 00:09:27.599
Caption: but if you find those too difficult or

00:09:25.838 --> 00:09:28.799
Caption: if you&#39;re doing this for the first time

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:31.440
Caption: and you want something that&#39;s a bit

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:33.518
Caption: easier to understand the accessibility

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.479
Caption: project has produced a checklist where

00:09:33.518 --> 00:09:38.719
Caption: you can just go down the checklist and

00:09:36.479 --> 00:09:40.639
Caption: it conveys it all to you in a much

00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:42.479
Caption: simpler manner and you can pretty much

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.440
Caption: just tick boxes to work out do you

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:47.119
Caption: actually follow the guidelines

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.119
Caption: one thing that i don&#39;t talk very much

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:51.440
Caption: about in this talk is designing for

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:52.880
Caption: intellectual and cognitive disabilities

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.799
Caption: but the main resource that you&#39;re going

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.039
Caption: to want for that is the u.s federal

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:59.200
Caption: plain language guidelines these are

00:09:57.039 --> 00:10:01.440
Caption: published by the us government and they

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.080
Caption: provide you instructions on how to use

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.599
Caption: plain clear english which is going to be

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:09.600
Caption: easier for people with intellectual and

00:10:05.599 --> 00:10:09.599
Caption: cognitive disabilities to understand

00:10:09.838 --> 00:10:14.799
Caption: and there&#39;s a blind lady called christy

00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:16.880
Caption: veers who produced a video which went

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:19.599
Caption: viral on twitter showing how she uses

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.320
Caption: her iphone and this i think is a really

00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:24.639
Caption: important thing for people to see

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.880
Caption: not because

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.519
Caption: well because it shows you what&#39;s

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.518
Caption: possible when you think outside the box

00:10:29.518 --> 00:10:33.440
Caption: and when you design these things

00:10:31.518 --> 00:10:35.518
Caption: taking into account a wide variety of

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.838
Caption: different perspectives the iphone has

00:10:35.518 --> 00:10:40.078
Caption: braille keyboards it has a great number

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:41.919
Caption: of haptic touch features which deliver

00:10:40.078 --> 00:10:44.919
Caption: data that you would usually only get

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:44.919
Caption: visually

00:10:46.719 --> 00:10:51.039
Caption: in the resources for accessible design

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.799
Caption: there are a there&#39;s a web page which

00:10:51.039 --> 00:10:54.799
Caption: links to a whole list of different

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:56.640
Caption: resources i&#39;m going to call out a few of

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:58.159
Caption: them here that i think are important and

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.640
Caption: the first one is the ax core

00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:03.278
Caption: accessibility testing library

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.958
Caption: now this is very important for

00:11:03.278 --> 00:11:06.398
Caption: accessibility because it is entirely

00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.078
Caption: open source and it&#39;s what google&#39;s

00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:10.958
Caption: accessibility checker and a lot of other

00:11:08.078 --> 00:11:13.039
Caption: similar things are built on

00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:15.119
Caption: the color oracle desktop filter is a

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:16.880
Caption: very important one for color blindness

00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:19.039
Caption: and the reason why i&#39;m calling this tool

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.200
Caption: out specifically is there are a bunch of

00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:23.278
Caption: browser extensions that you can get but

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.320
Caption: the color oracle desktop filter is the

00:11:23.278 --> 00:11:28.799
Caption: only one that will allow you to

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.799
Caption: plug it into desktop applications as

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:32.239
Caption: well so if you&#39;re developing a desktop

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:35.760
Caption: application rather than a web

00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:37.119
Caption: application that&#39;s a very useful tool

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.880
Caption: if you want to test what you&#39;re doing

00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:40.159
Caption: with a screen reader the patch yellow

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.479
Caption: group one of the very early

00:11:40.159 --> 00:11:44.239
Caption: accessibility consultancies produced a

00:11:42.479 --> 00:11:45.679
Caption: list of basic screen reader commands for

00:11:44.239 --> 00:11:47.599
Caption: pretty much all of the common screen

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:50.958
Caption: readers and you can just get those up on

00:11:47.599 --> 00:11:52.159
Caption: a computer and try them out yourself

00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.000
Caption: additionally

00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:55.919
Caption: the researchers at the university of

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.958
Caption: maryland produce the photosensitive

00:11:55.919 --> 00:12:00.559
Caption: epilepsy analysis tool a few years ago

00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.880
Caption: and that one is really important because

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:06.078
Caption: photosensitive epilepsy is a disability

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.760
Caption: that we can&#39;t ask people to test for

00:12:06.078 --> 00:12:09.039
Caption: if you&#39;re asking people to test for that

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.040
Caption: and they have a seizure that&#39;s

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:12.479
Caption: potentially going to be threatening to

00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:14.159
Caption: their health or in the worst case

00:12:12.479 --> 00:12:15.599
Caption: threatening to their life so the

00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:17.759
Caption: researchers at the university of

00:12:15.599 --> 00:12:19.679
Caption: maryland produce this tool which

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.160
Caption: basically allows you to check contrast

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:23.440
Caption: and animations on your website to ensure

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:27.440
Caption: that they&#39;re not going to be a problem

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.440
Caption: for people with photosensitive epilepsy

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.958
Caption: now guidelines are great guidelines are

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.479
Caption: a really good starting point but

00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:39.039
Caption: guidelines do not tell the whole story

00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:41.679
Caption: this really comes down to

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:44.638
Caption: that often misused adage of the 80 20

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:46.559
Caption: principle and i&#39;ll sum it up like this

00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:48.559
Caption: the vast majority of accessibility

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:50.559
Caption: issues that you might run into can be

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:52.559
Caption: very easily solved by looking at and

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:54.559
Caption: understanding the guidelines

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:56.320
Caption: but there are some accessibility issues

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:57.518
Caption: that the guidelines don&#39;t cover and

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.679
Caption: there are situations where the

00:12:57.518 --> 00:13:02.078
Caption: guidelines are misleading

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:03.760
Caption: in those sorts of scenarios

00:13:02.078 --> 00:13:06.398
Caption: what you want to do is make sure that

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.639
Caption: you have a clear and understandable path

00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:09.838
Caption: for people who have those issues to come

00:13:08.638 --> 00:13:11.440
Caption: to you

00:13:09.838 --> 00:13:13.440
Caption: report them

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.880
Caption: and get them to the right people so that

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.880
Caption: they are going to be actioned

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.479
Caption: and with most accessibility talks this

00:13:20.719 --> 00:13:24.398
Caption: is the point at which the person giving

00:13:22.479 --> 00:13:26.559
Caption: the talk would explain to you how to

00:13:24.398 --> 00:13:28.638
Caption: solve one particular problem in one

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:30.559
Caption: particular language for one particular

00:13:28.638 --> 00:13:32.638
Caption: scenario

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:34.479
Caption: this is not one of that talks and the

00:13:32.638 --> 00:13:36.320
Caption: reason for that is because i think it&#39;s

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:39.199
Caption: often very instructive to look at the

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.559
Caption: ways that people do this wrong

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.518
Caption: so that we can learn from them and

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:46.398
Caption: hopefully not repeat the mistakes

00:13:43.518 --> 00:13:48.239
Caption: this is atlassian confluence and my

00:13:46.398 --> 00:13:50.159
Caption: assumption is that the vast majority of

00:13:48.239 --> 00:13:52.559
Caption: the people in the audience here have

00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:54.239
Caption: used atlassian confluence before for

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:56.719
Caption: those of you who haven&#39;t it&#39;s basically

00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:58.958
Caption: a shared documentation wiki so you&#39;ve

00:13:56.719 --> 00:14:01.599
Caption: got a test space here you&#39;ve got a bunch

00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:04.398
Caption: of data you can click around it you can

00:14:01.599 --> 00:14:06.638
Caption: go in and create pages and when you

00:14:04.398 --> 00:14:08.479
Caption: click the button to create a page you

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:10.398
Caption: get something back that looks a bit like

00:14:08.479 --> 00:14:11.518
Caption: this

00:14:10.398 --> 00:14:12.559
Caption: and that

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:14.838
Caption: looks

00:14:12.559 --> 00:14:16.479
Caption: fine

00:14:14.838 --> 00:14:17.838
Caption: right

00:14:16.479 --> 00:14:19.679
Caption: but we&#39;re going to go back and look at

00:14:17.838 --> 00:14:21.278
Caption: that again because

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:23.518
Caption: despite the fact that this page was

00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:25.599
Caption: created in my test space which you can

00:14:23.518 --> 00:14:27.760
Caption: see because my name is up there

00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:29.359
Caption: i actually wasn&#39;t the person who created

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.600
Caption: it it was created by someone called

00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:34.880
Caption: matthew gregory and at the time that i

00:14:31.599 --> 00:14:36.880
Caption: first gave this talk matt was my manager

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.119
Caption: so why was it that matt was the person

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.278
Caption: who was creating this page and not me

00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:44.559
Caption: well

00:14:41.278 --> 00:14:46.479
Caption: that would be your answer because when i

00:14:44.559 --> 00:14:48.880
Caption: went into confluence back in the day and

00:14:46.479 --> 00:14:50.958
Caption: i tried to create pages what i would get

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.278
Caption: is that the button there would be cut

00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:55.119
Caption: off the bottom of the screen which meant

00:14:53.278 --> 00:14:58.880
Caption: that i could not navigate to it which

00:14:55.119 --> 00:15:00.719
Caption: meant that i could not create pages

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.518
Caption: oops

00:15:00.719 --> 00:15:03.119
Caption: so

00:15:01.518 --> 00:15:04.559
Caption: you can actually scroll the options

00:15:03.119 --> 00:15:06.239
Caption: within the confluence pop-up and

00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:08.958
Caption: atlassian have done a bit of work in

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:10.719
Caption: fixing this since but

00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.799
Caption: what this essentially meant at the time

00:15:10.719 --> 00:15:14.638
Caption: was that if you were using a magnified

00:15:12.799 --> 00:15:16.239
Caption: screen for particular configurations

00:15:14.638 --> 00:15:18.479
Caption: because you couldn&#39;t scroll the whole

00:15:16.239 --> 00:15:20.638
Caption: screen to see the whole pop-up you just

00:15:18.479 --> 00:15:22.159
Caption: wouldn&#39;t be able to create pages at all

00:15:20.638 --> 00:15:24.958
Caption: or you would have to learn how to tab

00:15:22.159 --> 00:15:26.799
Caption: navigate your way around blind without

00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:28.398
Caption: screen reader cues to be able to do it

00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:30.320
Caption: and that pretty much meant that that was

00:15:28.398 --> 00:15:31.838
Caption: a piece of work that i just offloaded

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.838
Caption: onto my colleagues every time i needed

00:15:31.838 --> 00:15:35.518
Caption: to create a page i called someone over

00:15:33.838 --> 00:15:37.760
Caption: and i went hey can you come do this for

00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:40.799
Caption: me please

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:43.518
Caption: so how do we improve it well you want to

00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:45.359
Caption: make sure that your ui elements are all

00:15:43.518 --> 00:15:47.440
Caption: scrollable and that nothing is cut off

00:15:45.359 --> 00:15:50.559
Caption: by the bottom of the screen so you want

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.159
Caption: to set it up so that it&#39;s not just you

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:54.239
Caption: know scrolling the options within the

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:56.078
Caption: pop-up but the whole page there is

00:15:54.239 --> 00:15:57.838
Caption: scrollable

00:15:56.078 --> 00:15:59.919
Caption: you want to make sure that you test your

00:15:57.838 --> 00:16:02.078
Caption: pop-up windows for accessibility so

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:04.559
Caption: looking at things like do they block out

00:16:02.078 --> 00:16:06.559
Caption: other elements of the user interface if

00:16:04.559 --> 00:16:08.958
Caption: someone is using a zoomed in screen or a

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:10.880
Caption: screen reader can they actually navigate

00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.719
Caption: their way around this pop-up window

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.958
Caption: without losing focus without things

00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:16.479
Caption: being cut off the bottom of the screen

00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:18.559
Caption: and the best way to deal with it is you

00:16:16.479 --> 00:16:20.719
Caption: zoom it up yourself or you

00:16:18.559 --> 00:16:22.958
Caption: find a visually impaired person you get

00:16:20.719 --> 00:16:25.198
Caption: them to test it for you and that will

00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:28.479
Caption: very quickly show you where a lot of

00:16:25.198 --> 00:16:28.479
Caption: those issues are going to be

00:16:29.278 --> 00:16:33.359
Caption: i need a human screen reader

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.958
Caption: now i was not the person who said this

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:36.880
Caption: the person who said i need a human

00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:38.000
Caption: screen reader was my friend&#39;s

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.000
Caption: grandmother

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.838
Caption: she is unfortunately now deceased she

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.838
Caption: was a lovely person

00:16:41.838 --> 00:16:46.880
Caption: and later on in life due to a

00:16:43.838 --> 00:16:50.000
Caption: degenerative disease she became blind

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:52.398
Caption: now she was quite religious and she used

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.479
Caption: the patheos website which built itself

00:16:52.398 --> 00:16:55.919
Caption: as hosting the conversation on faith to

00:16:54.479 --> 00:16:58.000
Caption: keep in touch with her religious

00:16:55.919 --> 00:17:00.638
Caption: community when she was no longer able to

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.198
Caption: easily go to church

00:17:00.638 --> 00:17:04.400
Caption: and when she started using pathos many

00:17:03.198 --> 00:17:06.318
Caption: many years ago

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.039
Caption: it looked like this

00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:11.599
Caption: and visually that site is not too bad it

00:17:09.038 --> 00:17:14.639
Caption: was also not all that bad to navigate

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:17.038
Caption: with a screen reader it wasn&#39;t perfect

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.958
Caption: but you could see where things were you

00:17:17.038 --> 00:17:20.639
Caption: could relatively easily navigate your

00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:22.719
Caption: way around most of it

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.119
Caption: and it was fairly apparent what was

00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:26.880
Caption: going on where they also designed it in

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:29.839
Caption: such a way that you didn&#39;t have auto

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.359
Caption: playing videos and cluttered pop-ups

00:17:29.839 --> 00:17:33.279
Caption: which would come up and block your view

00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:37.199
Caption: of part of the page

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.960
Caption: until in late 2017 early 2018 patheos

00:17:37.199 --> 00:17:40.719
Caption: went through a redesign and at the end

00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:42.959
Caption: of the redesign their website looked

00:17:40.719 --> 00:17:46.159
Caption: like this

00:17:42.959 --> 00:17:48.319
Caption: and i can&#39;t show you the accessibility

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.840
Caption: issues with their website

00:17:48.319 --> 00:17:52.159
Caption: because some of the problems that they

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:53.839
Caption: had were so bad that at the time i was

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.520
Caption: originally putting this talk together a

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:57.520
Caption: lot of the major browsers released a

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.760
Caption: feature that blocked a lot of these

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.119
Caption: obnoxious pop-ups on site that the

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.640
Caption: beginning of that text there

00:18:01.119 --> 00:18:04.160
Caption: advertisement

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.239
Caption: i wasn&#39;t using an ad blocker when i did

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.000
Caption: this that was just blocked but back in

00:18:06.239 --> 00:18:09.760
Caption: the day when my friend&#39;s grandmother was

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.760
Caption: trying to use this website

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.919
Caption: what would happen was she would tap

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.160
Caption: around and suddenly she would find

00:18:13.918 --> 00:18:18.000
Caption: herself in an ad pop-up or there would

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.000
Caption: be auto-playing videos that were talking

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.439
Caption: over her screen reader which meant that

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.760
Caption: she couldn&#39;t hear the cues that she

00:18:21.439 --> 00:18:25.199
Caption: needed to navigate around the website

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.320
Caption: and that made her feel something like

00:18:25.199 --> 00:18:28.000
Caption: this

00:18:26.319 --> 00:18:29.759
Caption: she was not happy she was not very

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.678
Caption: pleased and she no longer used the

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.359
Caption: pathos website

00:18:31.678 --> 00:18:35.599
Caption: if you want an example of this closer to

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:37.760
Caption: home kohl&#39;s the

00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:40.400
Caption: big supermarket chain

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.359
Caption: got sued by a screen reader user because

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.679
Caption: of their

00:18:41.359 --> 00:18:46.000
Caption: website for online ordering was not

00:18:43.678 --> 00:18:48.959
Caption: accessible with a screen reader

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.400
Caption: and coles ended up settling that lawsuit

00:18:48.959 --> 00:18:52.000
Caption: and one of the stipulations of the

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.080
Caption: settlement was that coles actually had

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.719
Caption: to make sure that their online website

00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:58.479
Caption: was accessible to screen reader users

00:18:56.719 --> 00:19:00.319
Caption: so if you want to have a look at someone

00:18:58.479 --> 00:19:01.918
Caption: who does this really well causes it and

00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:04.079
Caption: that&#39;s because now they know they have

00:19:01.918 --> 00:19:06.079
Caption: to do it

00:19:04.079 --> 00:19:06.798
Caption: oops

00:19:06.079 --> 00:19:08.959
Caption: so

00:19:06.798 --> 00:19:10.639
Caption: the sound on autoplaying videos talks

00:19:08.959 --> 00:19:12.239
Caption: over screen readers and when you think

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.558
Caption: about the fact that screen readers are

00:19:12.239 --> 00:19:16.160
Caption: providing auditory cues

00:19:14.558 --> 00:19:18.558
Caption: to help you with the visual cues that

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.880
Caption: you miss if you&#39;re vision impaired that

00:19:18.558 --> 00:19:23.119
Caption: can be quite a big problem but the

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:26.719
Caption: bigger problem is that if you can&#39;t see

00:19:23.119 --> 00:19:28.558
Caption: the video on the page you&#39;re relying on

00:19:26.719 --> 00:19:30.400
Caption: being able to hear the screen reader&#39;s

00:19:28.558 --> 00:19:32.319
Caption: triggers that will tell you how to close

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.160
Caption: it if the video is talking over the

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:36.639
Caption: screen reader that&#39;s not something that

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.160
Caption: you&#39;re going to be able to do

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.839
Caption: and what&#39;s even worse is that some of

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.679
Caption: these pop-up advertisements and auto

00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:44.000
Caption: playing videos will actually take screen

00:19:41.678 --> 00:19:46.000
Caption: readers into an entirely new container

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.479
Caption: which acts as a new page and then you

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.119
Caption: just get a bunch of triggers that go

00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:54.479
Caption: image image image item text

00:19:51.119 --> 00:19:56.400
Caption: and so on and so forth looping around

00:19:54.479 --> 00:19:58.000
Caption: and if you are a screen reader user

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.839
Caption: expecting to see a whole page and you

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.640
Caption: don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened that can be

00:19:59.839 --> 00:20:02.640
Caption: really confusing

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:07.038
Caption: to make matters worse not all pop-ups

00:20:05.199 --> 00:20:08.880
Caption: and auto-playing videos have a dismiss

00:20:07.038 --> 00:20:11.439
Caption: button that will even work if you don&#39;t

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.520
Caption: have a mouse there are some scenarios in

00:20:11.439 --> 00:20:15.519
Caption: which you set up your whole page and you

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.119
Caption: go through and you try and make sure

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.640
Caption: that you can actually close things and

00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:20.400
Caption: you find that that close trigger or that

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.799
Caption: dismiss trigger just isn&#39;t visible if

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.559
Caption: you&#39;re navigating via keyboard it&#39;s not

00:20:22.798 --> 00:20:26.880
Caption: correctly placed and that can be a

00:20:24.558 --> 00:20:29.439
Caption: really big problem

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.280
Caption: so how do we improve it well it&#39;s pretty

00:20:29.439 --> 00:20:33.279
Caption: good design just let people decide

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.919
Caption: whether they want to play videos auto

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.640
Caption: playing videos are really annoying and

00:20:35.918 --> 00:20:40.399
Caption: it is even more important to let users

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.640
Caption: decide because of the accessibility

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.400
Caption: implications of this

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.239
Caption: you also want to make it easy for

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.559
Caption: keyboard navigators and screen reader

00:20:46.239 --> 00:20:50.558
Caption: users to ignore or close those pop-up

00:20:48.558 --> 00:20:53.359
Caption: elements so make sure that the dismiss

00:20:50.558 --> 00:20:55.760
Caption: trigger is easily visible to a screen

00:20:53.359 --> 00:20:57.439
Caption: reader make sure that it&#39;s very early on

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.880
Caption: make sure that it&#39;s placed in the sort

00:20:57.439 --> 00:21:00.879
Caption: of location that they would think it

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.520
Caption: would be

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.798
Caption: now safari has a reader mode a lot of

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.320
Caption: other browsers have reader mode

00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:08.479
Caption: extensions there&#39;s even one you can get

00:21:06.319 --> 00:21:10.000
Caption: for the cli which i probably need to go

00:21:08.479 --> 00:21:10.959
Caption: back and add to the sources at some

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.038
Caption: point

00:21:10.959 --> 00:21:15.520
Caption: but what reader mode essentially does is

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:18.079
Caption: it strips out everything on the website

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.000
Caption: except for the text and the images

00:21:18.079 --> 00:21:21.678
Caption: and that can be a really useful fallback

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.280
Caption: for blind or visually impaired people

00:21:21.678 --> 00:21:25.760
Caption: because the screen reader is then going

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.159
Caption: to be able to readily navigate around it

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:30.079
Caption: so do check to make sure that your html

00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:31.520
Caption: is properly formatted check to make sure

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:33.199
Caption: that reader mode works the way that you

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.119
Caption: would expect it to

00:21:33.199 --> 00:21:37.119
Caption: and then put on a blindfold cover your

00:21:35.119 --> 00:21:38.400
Caption: screen use a screen reader yourself it&#39;s

00:21:37.119 --> 00:21:40.158
Caption: not going to be as good as getting

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.080
Caption: people who use it day to day but you

00:21:40.159 --> 00:21:44.080
Caption: will very quickly pick up on what the

00:21:42.079 --> 00:21:45.760
Caption: issues might be when you do a direct

00:21:44.079 --> 00:21:46.798
Caption: comparison of what the screen reader

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.959
Caption: gives you

00:21:46.798 --> 00:21:52.158
Caption: to what you actually get

00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:52.158
Caption: when you look at it visually

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:58.320
Caption: does anyone here remember geocities

00:21:56.319 --> 00:22:00.558
Caption: cool yeah we have an audience of people

00:21:58.319 --> 00:22:02.558
Caption: that remember geocities

00:22:00.558 --> 00:22:04.798
Caption: for those of you who don&#39;t geocity&#39;s

00:22:02.558 --> 00:22:07.439
Caption: websites tended to look something like

00:22:04.798 --> 00:22:09.038
Caption: this this is admittedly one of the less

00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:11.038
Caption: obnoxious options that i could have

00:22:09.038 --> 00:22:13.038
Caption: picked but it&#39;s still very emblematic of

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:14.719
Caption: what web design in that sort of era was

00:22:13.038 --> 00:22:16.479
Caption: like we&#39;ve got the word out we&#39;ve got

00:22:14.719 --> 00:22:18.959
Caption: the dancing penguin we&#39;ve got a bunch of

00:22:16.479 --> 00:22:21.038
Caption: clashing colors we&#39;ve got broken links

00:22:18.959 --> 00:22:23.520
Caption: we&#39;ve got a whole lot of text in

00:22:21.038 --> 00:22:24.719
Caption: different colors in thai um all that

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.640
Caption: we&#39;re really missing is you know the

00:22:24.719 --> 00:22:28.079
Caption: line of rainbow kirby&#39;s jumping across

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.880
Caption: the top and then it would be very much a

00:22:28.079 --> 00:22:32.719
Caption: geocities website

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.798
Caption: geocities is dead

00:22:32.719 --> 00:22:38.319
Caption: yahoo bought it and they killed it off

00:22:34.798 --> 00:22:40.239
Caption: in march of 2019.

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:41.759
Caption: fortunately or unfortunately depending

00:22:40.239 --> 00:22:44.959
Caption: on how you look at it a lot of the

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.798
Caption: people who came into uh web design in

00:22:44.959 --> 00:22:48.079
Caption: the era where geocities were state of

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:49.839
Caption: the art

00:22:48.079 --> 00:22:52.640
Caption: now actually have quite a lot of

00:22:49.839 --> 00:22:54.479
Caption: creative control over their own websites

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.959
Caption: and many of them have incorporated some

00:22:54.479 --> 00:22:59.599
Caption: of these elements of the geocities era

00:22:56.959 --> 00:23:01.119
Caption: into their corporate websites which is

00:22:59.599 --> 00:23:02.959
Caption: essentially the equivalent of taking

00:23:01.119 --> 00:23:04.959
Caption: your very productive businesses fancy

00:23:02.959 --> 00:23:07.279
Caption: corporate website we are very amazing

00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:09.439
Caption: and we will show you why

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.200
Caption: and putting a nyan cat across the top of

00:23:09.439 --> 00:23:12.959
Caption: it which is not something that i&#39;m going

00:23:11.199 --> 00:23:17.119
Caption: to recommend unless whatever your

00:23:12.959 --> 00:23:17.119
Caption: business is is very very niche

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.359
Caption: i have a friend who has photosensitive

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.479
Caption: epilepsy and she works in the it

00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:24.239
Caption: industry

00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:26.158
Caption: several years ago she had an encounter

00:23:24.239 --> 00:23:28.158
Caption: with one of these enterprising designers

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:29.679
Caption: from the geo cities era

00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:32.240
Caption: she heard about this particular tech

00:23:29.678 --> 00:23:34.079
Caption: company and she wanted to see what they

00:23:32.239 --> 00:23:35.359
Caption: were all about and so she went to their

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:36.959
Caption: website

00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:39.359
Caption: and what she encountered there was a

00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:42.158
Caption: giant strobing pink element that took up

00:23:39.359 --> 00:23:43.918
Caption: the top two thirds of her screen

00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:46.400
Caption: which pretty much immediately caused her

00:23:43.918 --> 00:23:48.399
Caption: to have a seizure and the end result of

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.200
Caption: that was that the enterprising designer

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.880
Caption: had a phone call which i really

00:23:51.199 --> 00:23:55.760
Caption: suspected he probably didn&#39;t want to be

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:57.119
Caption: on the other end of

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.159
Caption: oops

00:23:57.119 --> 00:24:00.400
Caption: so

00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:02.880
Caption: flashing flickering and strobing effects

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.960
Caption: are one of the major causes of seizures

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:07.599
Caption: and if you&#39;re a video game player and

00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:10.158
Caption: you get games in physical boxes if you

00:24:07.599 --> 00:24:11.918
Caption: flip over to the back of the game quite

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:14.240
Caption: often they have that little bit of text

00:24:11.918 --> 00:24:15.519
Caption: there that says hey

00:24:14.239 --> 00:24:16.880
Caption: there&#39;s a flashing flickering and

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.880
Caption: strobing warning here if you&#39;re photo

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.558
Caption: photosensitive you want to be careful

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.678
Caption: about playing this that&#39;s what that is

00:24:20.558 --> 00:24:23.839
Caption: for

00:24:21.678 --> 00:24:26.640
Caption: and it&#39;s much more severe generally if

00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:29.278
Caption: you&#39;re looking at saturated reds pinks

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.640
Caption: oranges and really high contrast effects

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:32.880
Caption: so if you&#39;re strobing something from

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.239
Caption: pink to white or red to white that&#39;s

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.918
Caption: going to be much more of a problem than

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:38.319
Caption: a tiny little animation in the corner

00:24:35.918 --> 00:24:39.918
Caption: that&#39;s going dark blue to dark green

00:24:38.319 --> 00:24:41.918
Caption: particularly because photosensitive

00:24:39.918 --> 00:24:43.599
Caption: epilepsy is a spectrum from mild to

00:24:41.918 --> 00:24:45.199
Caption: severe

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:47.278
Caption: at the milder end it&#39;s quite easy to

00:24:45.199 --> 00:24:49.519
Caption: work out but my friend being one of the

00:24:47.279 --> 00:24:51.440
Caption: more severe cases runs into this

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.719
Caption: more often than she should and so you&#39;ve

00:24:51.439 --> 00:24:56.000
Caption: got to be aware then of what the

00:24:52.719 --> 00:24:58.558
Caption: parameters are that you&#39;re dealing with

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.798
Caption: so how do we improve it well

00:24:58.558 --> 00:25:02.719
Caption: to begin with if you can you want to

00:25:00.798 --> 00:25:04.798
Caption: avoid using those flashing flickering

00:25:02.719 --> 00:25:07.119
Caption: and strobing effects

00:25:04.798 --> 00:25:08.558
Caption: if you do need to use them the two

00:25:07.119 --> 00:25:09.918
Caption: changes that you want to make are you

00:25:08.558 --> 00:25:11.599
Caption: want to make sure that they are low

00:25:09.918 --> 00:25:13.439
Caption: contrast and you want to make sure that

00:25:11.599 --> 00:25:15.278
Caption: they&#39;re as small as possible that

00:25:13.439 --> 00:25:17.119
Caption: flashing from dark blue to dark green in

00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:19.039
Caption: the corner is not going to be nearly as

00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:20.640
Caption: much of a problem as the giant strobing

00:25:19.038 --> 00:25:22.239
Caption: pink element that takes up the top two

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.400
Caption: thirds of your page

00:25:22.239 --> 00:25:26.479
Caption: and if you can avoid it don&#39;t use

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.719
Caption: particularly saturated reds and pinks

00:25:26.479 --> 00:25:31.599
Caption: and also sometimes oranges for those

00:25:28.719 --> 00:25:33.359
Caption: sorts of flashing effects

00:25:31.599 --> 00:25:35.359
Caption: if you really want to do this well and

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:37.918
Caption: you have a website where you absolutely

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:39.918
Caption: have to have animation on it give users

00:25:37.918 --> 00:25:41.359
Caption: the option to disable and enable it at

00:25:39.918 --> 00:25:43.439
Caption: will that&#39;s the sort of thing that&#39;s

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:45.520
Caption: really useful for scenarios like ling&#39;s

00:25:43.439 --> 00:25:47.038
Caption: cars because it means that if you have

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.200
Caption: people who have those sorts of photo

00:25:47.038 --> 00:25:51.519
Caption: sensitivity issues they can still

00:25:49.199 --> 00:25:52.880
Caption: actually access your website even if

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.000
Caption: it&#39;s not quite in the way that you might

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:59.039
Caption: have intended

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.119
Caption: now there is actually a certain amount

00:25:59.038 --> 00:26:03.519
Caption: of precedent for disabled people being

00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:05.119
Caption: involved in integrated sports and that

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.200
Caption: can be everything from kids playing in

00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:10.079
Caption: the schoolyard to olympic champions like

00:26:07.199 --> 00:26:13.119
Caption: rato ildico the hungarian fencer and im

00:26:10.079 --> 00:26:15.119
Caption: dong hyun the korean archer

00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:16.959
Caption: but for this specific case study i want

00:26:15.119 --> 00:26:19.839
Caption: to look at a more modern version of

00:26:16.959 --> 00:26:22.880
Caption: sports we&#39;re going to look at esports

00:26:19.839 --> 00:26:25.119
Caption: specifically league of legends

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:27.199
Caption: this is for those of you who are not

00:26:25.119 --> 00:26:29.038
Caption: into video games pretty much a

00:26:27.199 --> 00:26:31.599
Caption: computerized tower defense you have

00:26:29.038 --> 00:26:33.759
Caption: teams of five people and they&#39;re trying

00:26:31.599 --> 00:26:35.760
Caption: to defend a tower

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.760
Caption: each of the people on those five teams

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.159
Caption: can pick characters or champions that

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.479
Caption: have different abilities and league of

00:26:40.159 --> 00:26:44.880
Caption: legends has a really thriving

00:26:42.479 --> 00:26:47.199
Caption: professional scene you can actually make

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.798
Caption: a decent living playing league of

00:26:47.199 --> 00:26:51.038
Caption: legends professionally if you&#39;re very

00:26:48.798 --> 00:26:52.959
Caption: good at it

00:26:51.038 --> 00:26:54.959
Caption: several years ago the creators of league

00:26:52.959 --> 00:26:57.359
Caption: of legends introduced a new champion

00:26:54.959 --> 00:27:00.558
Caption: called tom kench and this is the titular

00:26:57.359 --> 00:27:04.479
Caption: catfish you can see there redfish on the

00:27:00.558 --> 00:27:06.399
Caption: left and green fish on the right

00:27:04.479 --> 00:27:08.400
Caption: tom kench had a mechanic that no other

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.880
Caption: character in the game had had before and

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.799
Caption: that mechanic is called grey health and

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.479
Caption: this is where we find out how many

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:16.399
Caption: colorblind people are in the audience

00:27:14.479 --> 00:27:18.079
Caption: today because for those of you who are

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.320
Caption: not color blind if you have a look at

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:21.599
Caption: that on the red side you can see that

00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:23.359
Caption: there&#39;s a chunk of the health bar that&#39;s

00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:25.278
Caption: red then there&#39;s a big chunk of the

00:27:23.359 --> 00:27:26.798
Caption: health bar that&#39;s gray and that&#39;s

00:27:25.279 --> 00:27:28.400
Caption: essentially acting as a shield which

00:27:26.798 --> 00:27:29.678
Caption: means that at this point tom kench is

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.960
Caption: unkillable

00:27:29.678 --> 00:27:32.959
Caption: and then on the right hand side you&#39;ve

00:27:30.959 --> 00:27:34.558
Caption: got that little bit which is kind of

00:27:32.959 --> 00:27:36.558
Caption: shaded out red and that&#39;s the health

00:27:34.558 --> 00:27:38.558
Caption: that he&#39;s lost

00:27:36.558 --> 00:27:40.719
Caption: but if i put a color blindness filter

00:27:38.558 --> 00:27:44.158
Caption: over that particularly on the left side

00:27:40.719 --> 00:27:46.558
Caption: the red side which is the enemy side

00:27:44.159 --> 00:27:48.400
Caption: that&#39;s suddenly not so clear

00:27:46.558 --> 00:27:50.399
Caption: and given that somewhere between eight

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.200
Caption: and ten percent of the population mostly

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.960
Caption: men are colorblind it was inevitable

00:27:53.199 --> 00:27:56.479
Caption: that when with teams of five you are

00:27:54.959 --> 00:27:58.640
Caption: eventually going to have a tweet like

00:27:56.479 --> 00:28:00.640
Caption: this from a professional player

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.640
Caption: if you didn&#39;t know i&#39;m colorblind along

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.239
Caption: with two other members of my team all

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.479
Caption: three of us can&#39;t see what health he&#39;s

00:28:04.239 --> 00:28:08.319
Caption: at in colorblind mode he being tom

00:28:06.479 --> 00:28:10.079
Caption: kenchia

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:11.519
Caption: again these are professional players

00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:14.839
Caption: this is something that they need to be

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.479
Caption: able to do to do their job

00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:18.640
Caption: oops

00:28:16.479 --> 00:28:20.798
Caption: so most colorblind people can&#39;t tell the

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.640
Caption: difference between red and green but as

00:28:20.798 --> 00:28:24.319
Caption: you can see there from the colorblind

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.719
Caption: filter the other crucial bit of

00:28:24.319 --> 00:28:28.880
Caption: information here is the contrast between

00:28:26.719 --> 00:28:31.038
Caption: colors if you can&#39;t distinguish the

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.319
Caption: difference between particular colors

00:28:31.038 --> 00:28:37.519
Caption: you&#39;re going to use that contrast to see

00:28:34.319 --> 00:28:39.038
Caption: is this what i think it is or is it not

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.719
Caption: because what you basically get with

00:28:39.038 --> 00:28:42.398
Caption: colors that color blind people can&#39;t see

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:44.558
Caption: is they&#39;ll generally look some variation

00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:47.119
Caption: of gray black brown or black or they&#39;ll

00:28:44.558 --> 00:28:49.038
Caption: be ambiguous

00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:50.239
Caption: and the way that we improve this to

00:28:49.038 --> 00:28:52.639
Caption: start with

00:28:50.239 --> 00:28:54.079
Caption: is by using a contrast checker to make

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.440
Caption: sure that elements are going to be

00:28:54.079 --> 00:28:57.119
Caption: viewable

00:28:55.439 --> 00:28:58.959
Caption: to people with all different types of

00:28:57.119 --> 00:29:00.880
Caption: color blindness and i&#39;m not just talking

00:28:58.959 --> 00:29:03.278
Caption: about red and green color blindness here

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.520
Caption: which are the most common types you also

00:29:03.279 --> 00:29:08.320
Caption: need to design for blue color blindness

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.239
Caption: and people with no color vision at all

00:29:08.319 --> 00:29:12.398
Caption: slack does this really well slack for

00:29:10.239 --> 00:29:14.798
Caption: many years has had accessibility themes

00:29:12.399 --> 00:29:16.559
Caption: for protonopia and deuteronopia so red

00:29:14.798 --> 00:29:18.798
Caption: green color blindness but also for

00:29:16.558 --> 00:29:20.398
Caption: trisha nopia which is blue github is

00:29:18.798 --> 00:29:22.719
Caption: another one that more recently has done

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:24.320
Caption: that very well

00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:25.839
Caption: and even if you have a colorblind mode

00:29:24.319 --> 00:29:28.000
Caption: particularly if you&#39;re just designing

00:29:25.839 --> 00:29:30.158
Caption: for red and green color blindness try

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.520
Caption: putting a filter over get people to test

00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:33.120
Caption: it and make sure that it actually does

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.119
Caption: what you think it would do

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:37.119
Caption: riot games the creators of league of

00:29:35.119 --> 00:29:39.199
Caption: legends to their credit did actually fix

00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:41.199
Caption: this quite quickly when it came to their

00:29:39.199 --> 00:29:42.880
Caption: attention but it&#39;s that sort of user

00:29:41.199 --> 00:29:44.398
Caption: acceptance testing that can often pick

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.079
Caption: up those issues before they get to

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:48.000
Caption: production

00:29:46.079 --> 00:29:49.760
Caption: and if you&#39;re building a colorblind mode

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.839
Caption: for something you want to try and make

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.839
Caption: sure that you&#39;re using meaningful icons

00:29:51.839 --> 00:29:56.158
Caption: or meaningful information to indicate

00:29:53.839 --> 00:29:58.079
Caption: different elements and states not just

00:29:56.159 --> 00:29:59.760
Caption: color if what you&#39;re getting is you know

00:29:58.079 --> 00:30:01.359
Caption: we&#39;re using a square a circle and a

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.440
Caption: rectangle to try to tell the difference

00:30:01.359 --> 00:30:05.439
Caption: between these things that&#39;s not much

00:30:03.439 --> 00:30:06.558
Caption: better whereas if you&#39;ve got a great big

00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:08.079
Caption: tick

00:30:06.558 --> 00:30:11.359
Caption: it&#39;s going to be apparent what it means

00:30:08.079 --> 00:30:11.359
Caption: whether it&#39;s green or not

00:30:13.119 --> 00:30:17.439
Caption: it&#39;s 2020 round three and i can&#39;t

00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:19.918
Caption: believe i&#39;m saying this

00:30:17.439 --> 00:30:22.558
Caption: but if we cast our mind back a few years

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:24.558
Caption: to 2020 round one

00:30:22.558 --> 00:30:26.798
Caption: before the whole covered pandemic thing

00:30:24.558 --> 00:30:29.199
Caption: happened you might remember i certainly

00:30:26.798 --> 00:30:31.119
Caption: do in melbourne we had pretty extensive

00:30:29.199 --> 00:30:32.798
Caption: bushfires which blanketed quite a lot of

00:30:31.119 --> 00:30:34.319
Caption: the country in smoke

00:30:32.798 --> 00:30:36.880
Caption: and through bushfires and through the

00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:38.880
Caption: covert 19 pandemic a lot of people

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.399
Caption: became aware of different aspects of

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.479
Caption: accessibility that they hadn&#39;t been

00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:44.399
Caption: aware of before and one of these was

00:30:42.479 --> 00:30:46.719
Caption: sign language interpreters because every

00:30:44.399 --> 00:30:48.960
Caption: time we had the prime minister or a

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:51.119
Caption: premier or a chief health officer or

00:30:48.959 --> 00:30:52.959
Caption: someone from the emergency services

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:54.719
Caption: coming onto our televisions giving

00:30:52.959 --> 00:30:56.558
Caption: broadcasts there was always an

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:58.719
Caption: australian sign language interpreter

00:30:56.558 --> 00:31:00.319
Caption: next to them and that was to ensure that

00:30:58.719 --> 00:31:02.479
Caption: for people where sign language is their

00:31:00.319 --> 00:31:05.038
Caption: first language they were able to get

00:31:02.479 --> 00:31:07.199
Caption: that information conveyed to them in a

00:31:05.038 --> 00:31:08.879
Caption: timely manner in case they needed to

00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:11.918
Caption: evacuate or to make sure that they knew

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.918
Caption: what health orders were changing

00:31:11.918 --> 00:31:16.319
Caption: but sign language interpretation is not

00:31:13.918 --> 00:31:18.158
Caption: the only way to make things accessible

00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:19.759
Caption: to people who are deaf or hard of

00:31:18.159 --> 00:31:21.679
Caption: hearing

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.760
Caption: you also want to look at things like

00:31:21.678 --> 00:31:25.918
Caption: captions and a lot of people will do

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.520
Caption: that using automated captioning

00:31:25.918 --> 00:31:30.000
Caption: solutions

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.839
Caption: which can be great until they&#39;re not as

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.479
Caption: illustrated by this tweet from cal

00:31:31.839 --> 00:31:36.558
Caption: montgomery a disability activist beta

00:31:34.479 --> 00:31:38.558
Caption: based out of the u.s

00:31:36.558 --> 00:31:41.038
Caption: if you value us equally and want us to

00:31:38.558 --> 00:31:43.119
Caption: participate fully we need full access to

00:31:41.038 --> 00:31:44.879
Caption: the pulsate briefing with enough lead

00:31:43.119 --> 00:31:46.798
Caption: time to absorb it

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.399
Caption: that chance is gone for this year which

00:31:46.798 --> 00:31:50.158
Caption: means that you have just sabotaged your

00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:52.320
Caption: own legislative agenda by leaving

00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:54.480
Caption: advocates unprepared

00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:56.639
Caption: now cal here was referring to one of the

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:57.760
Caption: biggest disability organizations in the

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.079
Caption: us

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.239
Caption: who had run an event the pulsate

00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:04.719
Caption: briefing and if you&#39;re wondering what

00:32:02.239 --> 00:32:07.038
Caption: paul say means that&#39;s how the automated

00:32:04.719 --> 00:32:08.719
Caption: captioning solution that they said was

00:32:07.038 --> 00:32:12.239
Caption: adequate for people to access that

00:32:08.719 --> 00:32:14.239
Caption: briefing rendered the term policy

00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:16.079
Caption: the rest of the the rest of the

00:32:14.239 --> 00:32:18.079
Caption: transcript of the briefing was similarly

00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:20.079
Caption: garbled

00:32:18.079 --> 00:32:22.079
Caption: now that&#39;s actually not that hard to

00:32:20.079 --> 00:32:24.719
Caption: solve it just requires a bit of human

00:32:22.079 --> 00:32:26.239
Caption: review afterwards and one group of

00:32:24.719 --> 00:32:28.398
Caption: people that do this really well are the

00:32:26.239 --> 00:32:30.558
Caption: podcasts this american life which is

00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:31.919
Caption: backed by national public radio in the

00:32:30.558 --> 00:32:33.599
Caption: us

00:32:31.918 --> 00:32:35.599
Caption: they do have a note on their website

00:32:33.599 --> 00:32:38.239
Caption: that says this american life is produced

00:32:35.599 --> 00:32:40.158
Caption: for the year and designed to be heard

00:32:38.239 --> 00:32:42.239
Caption: but they produce transcripts which are

00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:44.399
Caption: run through an automated transcription

00:32:42.239 --> 00:32:46.798
Caption: engine and then corrected manually by

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:49.039
Caption: human captioners and what that means is

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:51.199
Caption: that if you are deaf if you are hard of

00:32:49.038 --> 00:32:52.879
Caption: hearing or if you have auditory

00:32:51.199 --> 00:32:55.359
Caption: processing issues or for any other

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.119
Caption: reason are text reliant you can go

00:32:55.359 --> 00:32:58.398
Caption: through and read through that transcript

00:32:57.119 --> 00:33:00.959
Caption: and it will provide you with all of the

00:32:58.399 --> 00:33:00.960
Caption: information

00:33:01.038 --> 00:33:04.959
Caption: one group of people that don&#39;t do this

00:33:02.798 --> 00:33:07.599
Caption: quite so well are guardian australia and

00:33:04.959 --> 00:33:10.079
Caption: this is relevant because they produced

00:33:07.599 --> 00:33:12.239
Caption: one of the best sources of information

00:33:10.079 --> 00:33:13.918
Caption: in audio form about what was actually

00:33:12.239 --> 00:33:16.558
Caption: going on in terms of health roundups and

00:33:13.918 --> 00:33:18.239
Caption: things during the covert 19 pandemic

00:33:16.558 --> 00:33:19.518
Caption: but their approach to transcribing

00:33:18.239 --> 00:33:22.000
Caption: things can be described with this

00:33:19.519 --> 00:33:24.720
Caption: headline here guardian podcasts

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.399
Caption: why no transcripts that is to say that

00:33:24.719 --> 00:33:29.359
Caption: their approach is to not transcribe

00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:31.279
Caption: anything at all

00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:32.719
Caption: which means that if you are

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:35.760
Caption: deaf or hard of hearing or otherwise

00:33:32.719 --> 00:33:37.359
Caption: text reliant you cannot actually access

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.479
Caption: any of the material that guardian

00:33:37.359 --> 00:33:42.640
Caption: australia produces in audio form

00:33:40.479 --> 00:33:44.558
Caption: oops

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.799
Caption: and this is also important because text

00:33:44.558 --> 00:33:48.959
Caption: reliant people aren&#39;t necessarily deaf

00:33:46.798 --> 00:33:51.599
Caption: or hard of hearing autistic people

00:33:48.959 --> 00:33:54.000
Caption: people with adhd people with sensory

00:33:51.599 --> 00:33:56.158
Caption: processing disorders people who are on a

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.798
Caption: busy train and want to be able to read

00:33:56.159 --> 00:34:00.640
Caption: information rather than listening to it

00:33:58.798 --> 00:34:02.959
Caption: people with disorders like tinnitus

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.320
Caption: which affect the hearing in situational

00:34:02.959 --> 00:34:06.079
Caption: manners

00:34:04.319 --> 00:34:08.319
Caption: are all going to find themselves text

00:34:06.079 --> 00:34:10.800
Caption: reliant at some point or another even if

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.639
Caption: it&#39;s not all the time

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.320
Caption: so how do we improve it

00:34:12.638 --> 00:34:16.158
Caption: you want to provide transcripts for any

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.839
Caption: spoken audio on your website and you

00:34:16.158 --> 00:34:20.078
Caption: want to make sure that you caption any

00:34:17.839 --> 00:34:22.239
Caption: videos but do bear in mind that

00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:24.800
Caption: automated transcription software is not

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:26.560
Caption: a complete solution if you get a human

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.079
Caption: to correct the transcription before it&#39;s

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.439
Caption: published you&#39;re going to produce

00:34:28.079 --> 00:34:31.599
Caption: something that people can actually

00:34:29.439 --> 00:34:33.040
Caption: access

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:35.280
Caption: and the captions which were done by

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.879
Caption: netflix for stranger things sort of made

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.879
Caption: their way around the internet multiple

00:34:36.878 --> 00:34:40.638
Caption: times because they did a lot of other

00:34:38.878 --> 00:34:42.479
Caption: things really well in terms of

00:34:40.638 --> 00:34:44.319
Caption: describing changes in vocal tone and

00:34:42.479 --> 00:34:46.398
Caption: background noise if you&#39;re producing

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:50.239
Caption: particularly video content or complex

00:34:46.398 --> 00:34:50.239
Caption: video content that&#39;s really important

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:55.520
Caption: acting in artificial pancreas now that

00:34:53.439 --> 00:34:56.959
Caption: can be read in two different ways we can

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.280
Caption: talk about hacking together an

00:34:56.959 --> 00:35:02.159
Caption: artificial pancreas or we can talk about

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:05.280
Caption: hacking into an artificial pancreas but

00:35:02.159 --> 00:35:07.598
Caption: this case study actually covers both

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.599
Caption: this is a medtronic mini-med insulin

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:12.400

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:14.720
Caption: insulin-dependent with diabetes

00:35:12.399 --> 00:35:16.639
Caption: basically the pump sits just under your

00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:18.639
Caption: skin you plug it in and it delivers

00:35:16.639 --> 00:35:20.639
Caption: insulin at regular

00:35:18.639 --> 00:35:22.479
Caption: intervals without you having to inject

00:35:20.639 --> 00:35:23.919
Caption: yourself that&#39;s really good for a lot of

00:35:22.479 --> 00:35:25.520
Caption: people

00:35:23.919 --> 00:35:28.838
Caption: there&#39;s also been another recent

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:31.839
Caption: invention of the constant blood glucose

00:35:28.839 --> 00:35:33.200
Caption: monitor and that again similarly sits

00:35:31.839 --> 00:35:34.720
Caption: just below your skin provides

00:35:33.199 --> 00:35:37.040
Caption: information on what your blood glucose

00:35:34.719 --> 00:35:38.879
Caption: is all the time and

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.280
Caption: these medtronic mini-med insulin pumps

00:35:38.879 --> 00:35:43.358
Caption: had a really interesting security floor

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.760
Caption: which resulted in a lot of people with

00:35:43.358 --> 00:35:47.039
Caption: diabetes hunting them down because what

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.040
Caption: you could do

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.760
Caption: is there was an unsecured radio

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.919
Caption: frequency which was used by the remote

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.359
Caption: but you could also hook that up with a

00:35:53.919 --> 00:35:57.520
Caption: bridge between it and a little bit of

00:35:55.358 --> 00:35:59.679
Caption: open source source code

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.919
Caption: to a constant blood glucose monitor and

00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:04.399
Caption: have the insulin pump react and deliver

00:36:01.919 --> 00:36:05.679
Caption: insulin at various intervals based on

00:36:04.399 --> 00:36:07.598
Caption: that

00:36:05.679 --> 00:36:09.679
Caption: but the problem is

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:12.000
Caption: that security flaws always come with

00:36:09.679 --> 00:36:14.239
Caption: other issues and the fact that you could

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.839
Caption: hook in via this piece of source code

00:36:14.239 --> 00:36:17.598
Caption: also meant that your medtronic mini-made

00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:19.520
Caption: insulin pump was potentially vulnerable

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:21.200
Caption: to hacker attacks

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.119
Caption: which is not great because that allows

00:36:21.199 --> 00:36:25.520
Caption: you to actually modify the amount of

00:36:23.118 --> 00:36:27.679
Caption: insulin that you give to someone

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.959
Caption: so the fda the drug regulator in the us

00:36:27.679 --> 00:36:31.199
Caption: were made aware of this and they went

00:36:28.959 --> 00:36:33.358
Caption: away and issued an alert on it

00:36:31.199 --> 00:36:34.719
Caption: but there were a few enterprising hacker

00:36:33.358 --> 00:36:36.078
Caption: types in the healthcare industry who

00:36:34.719 --> 00:36:37.598
Caption: didn&#39;t think that they were taking this

00:36:36.079 --> 00:36:39.680
Caption: very seriously

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:41.119
Caption: so they got out their phones and they

00:36:39.679 --> 00:36:43.280
Caption: did a little bit of coding and they

00:36:41.118 --> 00:36:44.959
Caption: produced an android app which you could

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.439
Caption: use to hook into that really common

00:36:44.959 --> 00:36:49.919
Caption: frequency on any megatronic mini-made

00:36:47.439 --> 00:36:51.919
Caption: insulin pump in the immediate vicinity

00:36:49.919 --> 00:36:54.000
Caption: and either entirely withhold insulin

00:36:51.919 --> 00:36:56.239
Caption: from its user or deliver a lethal dose

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.320
Caption: of insulin immediately

00:36:56.239 --> 00:36:59.839
Caption: which finally resulted in medtronic

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.760
Caption: recalling their vulnerable mini-med

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:04.239
Caption: insulin pumps

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:06.079
Caption: oh dear

00:37:04.239 --> 00:37:08.239
Caption: and this is where we get into the fact

00:37:06.079 --> 00:37:11.839
Caption: that accessibility is not just about web

00:37:08.239 --> 00:37:13.839
Caption: accessibility in some scenarios security

00:37:11.839 --> 00:37:17.040
Caption: issues and many other types of issues

00:37:13.839 --> 00:37:18.800
Caption: can actually be accessibility problems

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:22.079
Caption: medical devices you&#39;re dealing with

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.439
Caption: people&#39;s lives it&#39;s really important and

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:24.960
Caption: what&#39;s more problematic is that if

00:37:23.439 --> 00:37:27.439
Caption: you&#39;re regulated by an external

00:37:24.959 --> 00:37:29.760
Caption: organization like the fda you may not

00:37:27.439 --> 00:37:31.520
Caption: hear about these issues quickly in some

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.679
Caption: scenarios you may not actually hear

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:35.439
Caption: about them at all

00:37:33.679 --> 00:37:37.040
Caption: so how do we improve this

00:37:35.439 --> 00:37:38.879
Caption: you want to start by considering the

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.839
Caption: possible attack factors a lot of this is

00:37:38.879 --> 00:37:44.159
Caption: just good basic security get a good pen

00:37:41.839 --> 00:37:45.839
Caption: testing company in particularly hardware

00:37:44.159 --> 00:37:47.760
Caption: pen testers for stuff like medical

00:37:45.839 --> 00:37:49.119
Caption: devices before your device goes to

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.959
Caption: market

00:37:49.118 --> 00:37:52.479
Caption: and make sure that if people notify you

00:37:50.959 --> 00:37:54.639
Caption: about security vulnerabilities you

00:37:52.479 --> 00:37:56.399
Caption: respond promptly

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:58.479
Caption: because the really sad thing about this

00:37:56.399 --> 00:38:00.719
Caption: use case is that unintended users can

00:37:58.479 --> 00:38:03.040
Caption: actually be a business opportunity and

00:38:00.719 --> 00:38:04.800
Caption: medtronic weren&#39;t the ones that ended up

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.079
Caption: capitalizing on it

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.160
Caption: there were a couple of different

00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:11.280
Caption: companies who saw these issues and

00:38:08.159 --> 00:38:13.598
Caption: produced secure insulin pumps which were

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.839
Caption: set up properly which you could use to

00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:18.160
Caption: hook into derivatives of that original

00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:20.320
Caption: source code on a secure channel to

00:38:18.159 --> 00:38:23.199
Caption: produce your closed loop insulin

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.199
Caption: delivery system

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:26.880
Caption: and this is where we get to my favorite

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:29.199
Caption: case study of the bunch because this is

00:38:26.879 --> 00:38:33.439
Caption: another one that concerns me

00:38:29.199 --> 00:38:35.439
Caption: i have been giving this talk since 2019

00:38:33.439 --> 00:38:36.800
Caption: and when i realized that i was going to

00:38:35.439 --> 00:38:38.479
Caption: be talking to people a lot about

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.880
Caption: accessibility when i became an

00:38:38.479 --> 00:38:43.358
Caption: accidental accessibility advocate

00:38:40.879 --> 00:38:45.519
Caption: i went okay i&#39;ve got to find some way of

00:38:43.358 --> 00:38:47.919
Caption: making sure that i know about what is

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.439
Caption: going on in the accessibility world and

00:38:47.919 --> 00:38:51.199
Caption: one way that i did that was through my

00:38:49.439 --> 00:38:53.199
Caption: linkedin feed

00:38:51.199 --> 00:38:55.040
Caption: so i was looking a lot of information

00:38:53.199 --> 00:38:57.760
Caption: about accessibility i was following the

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.119
Caption: accessibility hashtag and one day i was

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.959
Caption: going through my linkedin feed and a

00:38:59.118 --> 00:39:02.639
Caption: post popped up saying there&#39;s an

00:39:00.959 --> 00:39:04.959
Caption: accessibility consultant that&#39;s giving a

00:39:02.639 --> 00:39:07.118
Caption: talk about accessibility on this date at

00:39:04.959 --> 00:39:08.800
Caption: this time at this venue

00:39:07.118 --> 00:39:10.959
Caption: and i went great cool

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.640
Caption: i know some things about accessibility i

00:39:10.959 --> 00:39:15.358
Caption: know quite a lot about the things that

00:39:12.639 --> 00:39:16.399
Caption: are directly applicable to me as well as

00:39:15.358 --> 00:39:18.319
Caption: more about the things that are

00:39:16.399 --> 00:39:19.039
Caption: applicable to my friends people that i

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.880
Caption: know

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:24.640
Caption: but there&#39;s always something that you

00:39:20.879 --> 00:39:26.879
Caption: can learn from scenarios like this

00:39:24.639 --> 00:39:28.959
Caption: so i go along i get off work at 4 30 i

00:39:26.879 --> 00:39:31.519
Caption: take the train to the venue

00:39:28.959 --> 00:39:33.358
Caption: to see this

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.599
Caption: that&#39;s a set of stairs

00:39:33.358 --> 00:39:37.039
Caption: but that wasn&#39;t the only set of stairs

00:39:35.599 --> 00:39:39.680
Caption: to get into the building there were in

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:42.400
Caption: fact three similar sets of stairs that

00:39:39.679 --> 00:39:44.159
Caption: one and two more after the glass door to

00:39:42.399 --> 00:39:48.000
Caption: get to the lift which would then take

00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:49.679
Caption: you up to where the event was being held

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.239
Caption: and i described this to a couple of

00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:53.919
Caption: friends of mine as being like a roomba

00:39:52.239 --> 00:39:56.719
Caption: just sitting at the bottom of a set of

00:39:53.919 --> 00:39:58.479
Caption: stairs repeatedly shouting error 406

00:39:56.719 --> 00:40:01.040
Caption: which for those of you who are not well

00:39:58.479 --> 00:40:03.520
Caption: versed in html error codes means not

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.520
Caption: acceptable

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.760
Caption: so i get up there i listened to the

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.079
Caption: whole talk and i had basically crawled

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.479
Caption: up i i basically crawled up the last

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:14.079
Caption: flight of stairs to get there

00:40:12.479 --> 00:40:16.879
Caption: and i said to the accessibility

00:40:14.079 --> 00:40:18.239
Caption: consultant does it strike you as ironic

00:40:16.879 --> 00:40:20.159
Caption: that you&#39;re giving a talk about web

00:40:18.239 --> 00:40:22.079
Caption: accessibility in a venue that&#39;s

00:40:20.159 --> 00:40:23.199
Caption: inaccessible and he looks at me and he

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:24.720
Caption: goes

00:40:23.199 --> 00:40:26.879
Caption: you know i hadn&#39;t really thought about

00:40:24.719 --> 00:40:30.239
Caption: that

00:40:26.879 --> 00:40:32.078
Caption: and i don&#39;t think that i need to explain

00:40:30.239 --> 00:40:34.320
Caption: the irony here but we&#39;re going to do the

00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:36.400
Caption: post-mortem anyway

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.079
Caption: so if you&#39;re running events and full

00:40:36.399 --> 00:40:40.159
Caption: credit to ddd perk here because they&#39;ve

00:40:38.079 --> 00:40:41.280
Caption: done a brilliant job of this you want to

00:40:40.159 --> 00:40:42.959
Caption: make sure that your venues are

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:45.520
Caption: wheelchair accessible you want to make

00:40:42.959 --> 00:40:47.520
Caption: sure that they have disabled bathrooms

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.119
Caption: so many times i have gone to events to

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.199
Caption: find that the disabled bathrooms are on

00:40:49.118 --> 00:40:52.959
Caption: a different floor or they&#39;re locked or

00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:54.719
Caption: no one knows where they are or you&#39;ve

00:40:52.959 --> 00:40:58.000
Caption: got to go and talk to security to

00:40:54.719 --> 00:41:00.159
Caption: actually get the key

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.679
Caption: but there are more advanced types of

00:41:00.159 --> 00:41:03.919
Caption: things that you can do which help people

00:41:01.679 --> 00:41:05.280
Caption: with a variety of different disabilities

00:41:03.919 --> 00:41:07.040
Caption: so you want to look at things like

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.959
Caption: providing quiet spaces for people which

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.839
Caption: again is something that ddd perth has

00:41:08.959 --> 00:41:11.838
Caption: done

00:41:09.839 --> 00:41:14.160
Caption: and making sure that there is a lot of

00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:16.800
Caption: different adaptive technology around so

00:41:14.159 --> 00:41:18.239
Caption: sign language interpreters if you&#39;ve got

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.079
Caption: hearing loops

00:41:18.239 --> 00:41:22.000
Caption: one of my friends has been hard of

00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:24.079
Caption: hearing basically her whole life went

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.479
Caption: and got fitted with a hearing aid

00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:28.720
Caption: in her 40s and she called me up and she

00:41:26.479 --> 00:41:30.239
Caption: said dawn i am so happy because for the

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:32.319
Caption: first time i can hear the announcements

00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:33.520
Caption: at the train station when i turn on my

00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:35.920
Caption: hearing aid and i plug it into the

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:37.280
Caption: hearing loop

00:41:35.919 --> 00:41:38.879
Caption: and things like you know audio

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:40.159
Caption: descriptions of slides you&#39;ll see as i

00:41:38.879 --> 00:41:41.759
Caption: go through this talk i&#39;ve tried to

00:41:40.159 --> 00:41:44.078
Caption: describe everything that&#39;s on the slides

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.679
Caption: as i go but what&#39;s really important here

00:41:44.079 --> 00:41:47.839
Caption: is making sure that you include people

00:41:45.679 --> 00:41:49.280
Caption: with disabilities in discussions about

00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:50.960
Caption: accessibility

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.959
Caption: and if you don&#39;t know whether people

00:41:50.959 --> 00:41:55.118
Caption: with disabilities are the question that

00:41:52.959 --> 00:41:57.280
Caption: you need to ask yourself and again this

00:41:55.118 --> 00:41:59.279
Caption: is not just applicable to disability is

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.439
Caption: who&#39;s not in the room and why aren&#39;t

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.959
Caption: they here because sometimes the reason

00:42:01.439 --> 00:42:04.800
Caption: why they aren&#39;t here is going to be as

00:42:02.959 --> 00:42:06.318
Caption: simple as three flights of stairs into

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.160
Caption: the venue

00:42:06.319 --> 00:42:10.640

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:54.640
Caption: my career journey because it&#39;s not

01:08:52.798 --> 01:08:57.198
Caption: probably the most typical career journey

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.319
Caption: you&#39;d take um to become a developer

01:08:57.199 --> 01:08:59.759
Caption: and then from there we&#39;re going to go

01:08:58.318 --> 01:09:01.198
Caption: into how did all the teaching and

01:08:59.758 --> 01:09:03.599
Caption: mentoring that i&#39;ve done helped me to

01:09:01.199 --> 01:09:05.199
Caption: become a better developer

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.479
Caption: and from that what are the tips and

01:09:05.199 --> 01:09:08.560
Caption: tricks that i&#39;ve learned to help you

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:10.479
Caption: become an effective teacher or mentor

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:13.120
Caption: while you&#39;re also working as a dev or

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:15.199
Caption: just in tech in general and how does all

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.560
Caption: of this come together to help us improve

01:09:15.199 --> 01:09:18.640
Caption: the diversity

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.399
Caption: in our industry

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.640
Caption: so let me tell you a little bit about my

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:23.358
Caption: career and where i am today

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.080
Caption: so

01:09:23.358 --> 01:09:28.479
Caption: uh at the moment i am a senior engineer

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:31.439
Caption: and developer mentor at envato

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:32.959
Caption: has anybody heard of envato

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:34.479
Caption: yeah we&#39;ve got shocking brand

01:09:32.959 --> 01:09:36.479
Caption: recognition recognition we&#39;re trying to

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:37.278
Caption: do something about it but basically we

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:40.238
Caption: sell

01:09:37.278 --> 01:09:43.119
Caption: uh well we provide uh stock footage or

01:09:40.238 --> 01:09:45.198
Caption: photos or fonts or presentations we

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.719
Caption: basically create and sell creative stock

01:09:45.199 --> 01:09:48.719
Caption: so even if you haven&#39;t heard of us you

01:09:46.719 --> 01:09:51.279
Caption: have definitely seen us

01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:53.120
Caption: being used and we support

01:09:51.278 --> 01:09:54.879
Caption: thousands of authors around the world

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.879
Caption: who might be photographers or make

01:09:54.879 --> 01:09:58.879
Caption: really cool animations and whatnot and

01:09:56.879 --> 01:10:00.799
Caption: we sell via what they create on our

01:09:58.879 --> 01:10:02.560
Caption: platforms and so far we have paid

01:10:00.799 --> 01:10:04.158
Caption: millions and millions of dollars towards

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:06.080
Caption: authors and we have supported thousands

01:10:04.159 --> 01:10:09.040
Caption: and thousands of creators

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:11.280
Caption: so we are big on community um which is

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:13.679
Caption: probably why i work there because the

01:10:11.279 --> 01:10:15.039
Caption: values align really closely to mine but

01:10:13.679 --> 01:10:17.040
Caption: also i work there because i have a

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:20.399
Caption: really cool job so i&#39;m a developer

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:22.719
Caption: mentor which means that we hire

01:10:20.399 --> 01:10:24.479
Caption: apprentice developers and they get to

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:26.640
Caption: spend nine months with me or another

01:10:24.479 --> 01:10:29.279
Caption: developer mentor just training and

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.399
Caption: learning how to become a effective

01:10:29.279 --> 01:10:32.799
Caption: developer

01:10:30.399 --> 01:10:34.640
Caption: on a delivery team at envato and then

01:10:32.799 --> 01:10:36.000
Caption: they get hired into a team at envaro of

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.280
Caption: their choice and then we take two new

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.560
Caption: apprentices and they get to hang out

01:10:37.279 --> 01:10:40.559
Caption: with the developer mentor and do the

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.839
Caption: same and this program has existed at

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:46.159
Caption: envato for about five years now

01:10:43.839 --> 01:10:48.399
Caption: and i just joined about six months ago

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:49.760
Caption: to help grow the program

01:10:48.399 --> 01:10:51.198
Caption: so we&#39;re going to circle back to that in

01:10:49.759 --> 01:10:54.319
Caption: a little bit

01:10:51.199 --> 01:10:56.479
Caption: so my career journey i have been in tech

01:10:54.319 --> 01:10:59.040
Caption: for about nine years which i think is

01:10:56.479 --> 01:11:01.439
Caption: really impressive because i&#39;m only 25

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.239
Caption: and so in that nine years

01:11:01.439 --> 01:11:05.439
Caption: i have had the same goals but basically

01:11:04.238 --> 01:11:08.000
Caption: the whole time

01:11:05.439 --> 01:11:10.799
Caption: one of them was i wanted to feel

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.040
Caption: confident in my role as a developer i

01:11:10.799 --> 01:11:14.559
Caption: got into tech when i was 16 and i didn&#39;t

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.239
Caption: know what i was doing and i definitely

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:17.839
Caption: knew that i didn&#39;t know what i was doing

01:11:16.238 --> 01:11:20.079
Caption: and so i&#39;ve spent a lot of my career

01:11:17.839 --> 01:11:21.919
Caption: just wanting one day to feel

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.800
Caption: confident and like i do know what i&#39;m

01:11:21.919 --> 01:11:24.879
Caption: doing

01:11:22.799 --> 01:11:26.639
Caption: um and i think it&#39;s only like maybe six

01:11:24.879 --> 01:11:27.600
Caption: months ago when i joined envato that i

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.280
Caption: finally

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.520
Caption: started to actually feel confident and

01:11:29.279 --> 01:11:33.359
Caption: that yeah i am actually a developer

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.120
Caption: but the other goal that i&#39;ve had in my

01:11:33.359 --> 01:11:37.678
Caption: career is i

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:40.000
Caption: want and have done a lot of work towards

01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:41.840
Caption: helping other women to get into our

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.279
Caption: industry in technical roles in

01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:44.959
Caption: particular

01:11:43.279 --> 01:11:46.559
Caption: and the reason that i&#39;ve had this goal

01:11:44.959 --> 01:11:48.560
Caption: is because every time i joined a dev

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.239
Caption: team or worked at a tech company i would

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.239
Caption: love it i would have so much fun being a

01:11:50.238 --> 01:11:54.799
Caption: developer but over time i would just get

01:11:52.238 --> 01:11:56.879
Caption: more and more bitter about how many men

01:11:54.799 --> 01:11:59.520
Caption: are on my team and how few women are on

01:11:56.879 --> 01:12:01.678
Caption: the team and so i would then bounce back

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.520
Caption: to working in education so i&#39;ve spent

01:12:01.679 --> 01:12:05.520
Caption: about half of my career in education

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.199
Caption: half of my career in tech and i don&#39;t

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.640
Caption: mean that i went and got a degree in

01:12:07.199 --> 01:12:10.239
Caption: teaching and i taught in schools that&#39;s

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:13.280
Caption: not what i did i&#39;ve worked with

01:12:10.238 --> 01:12:16.000
Caption: companies like she codes to just mentor

01:12:13.279 --> 01:12:17.520
Caption: other women in tech of various ages and

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.679
Caption: not just at chico it&#39;s through various

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.520
Caption: organizations and so through that i have

01:12:19.679 --> 01:12:23.440
Caption: mentored people who are like five years

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:25.359
Caption: old all the way up to people who are

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:26.959
Caption: very near retirement age

01:12:25.359 --> 01:12:28.799
Caption: so i have a lot of experience in

01:12:26.959 --> 01:12:31.279
Caption: teaching people about tech and helping

01:12:28.799 --> 01:12:33.439
Caption: people find roles in the tech industry

01:12:31.279 --> 01:12:35.919
Caption: but this created a bit of a different

01:12:33.439 --> 01:12:38.319
Caption: kind of problem for me and that was i&#39;ve

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:39.279
Caption: bounced between education and tech so

01:12:38.319 --> 01:12:41.520
Caption: much

01:12:39.279 --> 01:12:43.520
Caption: that i started feeling like i don&#39;t know

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.600
Caption: how to build my own technical skills

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.919
Caption: while i&#39;m spending so much time focused

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.840
Caption: on teaching fundamentals because i&#39;ve

01:12:47.919 --> 01:12:51.919
Caption: spent so much time teaching people up

01:12:49.839 --> 01:12:54.158
Caption: until their first role in tech and i

01:12:51.919 --> 01:12:55.439
Caption: haven&#39;t spent any time teaching you know

01:12:54.159 --> 01:12:57.679
Caption: devs who have been in the industry for

01:12:55.439 --> 01:12:58.959
Caption: like 15 years that&#39;s just not what i do

01:12:57.679 --> 01:13:00.640
Caption: and so

01:12:58.959 --> 01:13:02.319
Caption: throughout my career i&#39;ve had moments of

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.679
Caption: imposter syndrome creep in because i

01:13:02.319 --> 01:13:05.839
Caption: think oh i&#39;ve spent too long in

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:07.280
Caption: education and i&#39;m starting to not

01:13:05.839 --> 01:13:09.520
Caption: understand what my dear friends are

01:13:07.279 --> 01:13:11.119
Caption: talking about so now i&#39;m feeling behind

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:12.560
Caption: and i&#39;d have a small panic and then i&#39;d

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.919
Caption: go back and take but then i&#39;d be in t

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.199
Caption: and think oh there&#39;s so many dudes here

01:13:13.919 --> 01:13:17.359
Caption: and there&#39;s no women so then i&#39;d go back

01:13:15.199 --> 01:13:19.440
Caption: to education and the cycle just repeated

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:21.439
Caption: itself

01:13:19.439 --> 01:13:23.040
Caption: so part of this was because i was

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:25.040
Caption: feeling like oh i&#39;m spending so much

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.560
Caption: time teaching

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:29.359
Caption: and i&#39;m not really spending time working

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:31.359
Caption: on my skills and i had this perception

01:13:29.359 --> 01:13:33.520
Caption: that in order to become a better

01:13:31.359 --> 01:13:35.678
Caption: engineer and in order to improve my

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:37.279
Caption: engineering skills i had to spend a lot

01:13:35.679 --> 01:13:39.679
Caption: of time doing what i could engineery

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:41.678
Caption: things so for me that was programming

01:13:39.679 --> 01:13:43.920
Caption: and i think this makes sense like the

01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:45.600
Caption: more time you spend programming probably

01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:46.799
Caption: you&#39;re going to get better at it and so

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.800
Caption: your engineering skills are going to

01:13:46.799 --> 01:13:50.879
Caption: improve but i realize that this is quite

01:13:48.799 --> 01:13:52.319
Caption: a narrow-minded approach to being an

01:13:50.879 --> 01:13:54.080
Caption: engineer

01:13:52.319 --> 01:13:56.079
Caption: and so i&#39;ve adapted this over the last

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.159
Caption: few months um from my role at envato

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.760
Caption: i&#39;ve realized that this is actually what

01:13:58.159 --> 01:14:01.439
Caption: it is to improve your skills in

01:13:59.759 --> 01:14:03.039
Caption: engineering you&#39;ve got to spend a little

01:14:01.439 --> 01:14:04.959
Caption: bit of time teaching you&#39;ve got to spend

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.799
Caption: a little bit of time programming but if

01:14:04.959 --> 01:14:08.238
Caption: ultimately if you want to really rapidly

01:14:06.799 --> 01:14:09.919
Caption: improve your own skills you&#39;ve got to

01:14:08.238 --> 01:14:12.000
Caption: spend a lot of time programming and

01:14:09.919 --> 01:14:14.640
Caption: teaching you can&#39;t just do one and

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.799
Caption: expect your skills to improve

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.399
Caption: and the reason that i think i&#39;ve had

01:14:16.799 --> 01:14:20.319
Caption: this realization over the last six

01:14:18.399 --> 01:14:22.158
Caption: months is because when i was hired at

01:14:20.319 --> 01:14:24.319
Caption: envato like i went through the interview

01:14:22.159 --> 01:14:27.040
Caption: process to be a developer mentor but to

01:14:24.319 --> 01:14:28.399
Caption: fit into you know their structure of um

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.159
Caption: well how do we pay you and how do we

01:14:28.399 --> 01:14:33.600
Caption: compare you to other people that gave me

01:14:30.159 --> 01:14:35.840
Caption: the role senior engineer and i was so

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:37.359
Caption: scared because i have never taken on a

01:14:35.839 --> 01:14:39.359
Caption: role that had seen you in the front of

01:14:37.359 --> 01:14:41.040
Caption: it before and i was thinking oh my gosh

01:14:39.359 --> 01:14:43.279
Caption: i haven&#39;t been a div for actually that

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:44.560
Caption: long i don&#39;t know what i&#39;m doing why&#39;d

01:14:43.279 --> 01:14:46.718
Caption: they call me a senior they&#39;re going to

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:48.239
Caption: find me out i&#39;m going to be demoted i&#39;m

01:14:46.719 --> 01:14:50.080
Caption: going to be fine like all the imposters

01:14:48.238 --> 01:14:51.519
Caption: just just came everywhere but as soon as

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.679
Caption: i started

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:57.679
Caption: i realized that my

01:14:53.679 --> 01:14:58.479
Caption: career in education had prepared me so

01:14:57.679 --> 01:15:00.800
Caption: well

01:14:58.479 --> 01:15:02.959
Caption: into stepping into the role of senior

01:15:00.799 --> 01:15:04.799
Caption: engineer and i notice it in the other

01:15:02.959 --> 01:15:07.198
Caption: engineers that i work with and i notice

01:15:04.799 --> 01:15:09.279
Caption: it in all the engineers i interact with

01:15:07.199 --> 01:15:10.880
Caption: through mentoring other programs and

01:15:09.279 --> 01:15:12.479
Caption: also through

01:15:10.879 --> 01:15:14.000
Caption: just being on other dev teams in the

01:15:12.479 --> 01:15:15.919
Caption: past and i&#39;ve realized that the

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.839
Caption: engineers who have dedicated more of

01:15:15.919 --> 01:15:20.080
Caption: their career towards teaching or

01:15:17.839 --> 01:15:21.839
Caption: mentoring or generally helping somebody

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.120
Caption: else in their team are the better

01:15:21.839 --> 01:15:25.040
Caption: engineers

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:27.760
Caption: which shouldn&#39;t sound too shocking but

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:30.159
Caption: this was quite a realization that i had

01:15:27.759 --> 01:15:32.399
Caption: so i want to unpack this a little bit

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:34.080
Caption: and i want us to have a little chat

01:15:32.399 --> 01:15:35.520
Caption: about how did teaching

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.120
Caption: actually help me to be a better

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.319
Caption: developer and therefore how can it

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:39.919
Caption: actually help you to be a better

01:15:38.319 --> 01:15:41.119
Caption: developer

01:15:39.919 --> 01:15:43.040
Caption: and i&#39;m just going to interject here

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.360
Caption: like i said in my blib um i&#39;m going to

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:46.879
Caption: use a lot of examples about engineering

01:15:45.359 --> 01:15:48.560
Caption: but this could apply as far as i&#39;m

01:15:46.879 --> 01:15:50.000
Caption: concerned to anyone in any industry

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:51.679
Caption: doing any kind of job just my

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.359
Caption: experiences in engineering so that&#39;s

01:15:51.679 --> 01:15:55.760
Caption: what i&#39;m going to roll with

01:15:53.359 --> 01:15:57.600
Caption: so how did teaching help me to be a

01:15:55.759 --> 01:16:00.158
Caption: better dev

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:03.040
Caption: i have learned that you end up with a

01:16:00.159 --> 01:16:05.040
Caption: much deeper understanding of a concept

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.959
Caption: if you are bracing yourself for someone

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:08.719
Caption: to ask you why

01:16:06.959 --> 01:16:10.238
Caption: so if you know that you&#39;re going to

01:16:08.719 --> 01:16:12.000
Caption: learn something and next week someone&#39;s

01:16:10.238 --> 01:16:14.000
Caption: going to say oh why did you do that why

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.319
Caption: did you use that why did you put it in

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.319
Caption: that context what would you use instead

01:16:16.319 --> 01:16:20.399
Caption: when you know that you&#39;re going to be

01:16:18.319 --> 01:16:22.639
Caption: asked this just

01:16:20.399 --> 01:16:25.198
Caption: absolute massive pile of questions you

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:27.120
Caption: end up preparing for it so when i go and

01:16:25.199 --> 01:16:29.199
Caption: learn a new concept i don&#39;t just learn

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.520
Caption: the thing and then implement it i learn

01:16:29.199 --> 01:16:34.159
Caption: the thing i learn what alternatives i

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.000
Caption: could use instead i learned where other

01:16:34.159 --> 01:16:37.760
Caption: where else i could implement this thing

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.199
Caption: i learned what the trade-offs are of

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:41.039
Caption: this thing and then i go ahead and

01:16:39.199 --> 01:16:42.719
Caption: actually use it and it means that the

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.040
Caption: next week when someone asks me why i did

01:16:42.719 --> 01:16:47.280
Caption: that like i&#39;m braced for the answer like

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:49.439
Caption: i know what i want to say

01:16:47.279 --> 01:16:51.119
Caption: and that&#39;s entirely because

01:16:49.439 --> 01:16:53.359
Caption: the more junior someone is in their

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.040
Caption: career as an engineer the harder the

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:56.560
Caption: questions are and the more intense the

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.719
Caption: questions are and the more they just

01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:00.319
Caption: start to absolutely grill you

01:16:58.719 --> 01:17:01.760
Caption: i&#39;ve found with the

01:17:00.319 --> 01:17:03.678
Caption: the more senior someone is in their

01:17:01.759 --> 01:17:05.599
Caption: career the more if i give a confident

01:17:03.679 --> 01:17:06.800
Caption: answer they&#39;re just gonna go yeah okay

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.919
Caption: and they just roll with it whereas the

01:17:06.799 --> 01:17:10.238
Caption: junior&#39;s gonna be like that&#39;s not good

01:17:07.919 --> 01:17:11.919
Caption: enough i need more and so you end up

01:17:10.238 --> 01:17:14.879
Caption: having to understand something way

01:17:11.919 --> 01:17:16.399
Caption: deeper than you would otherwise

01:17:14.879 --> 01:17:18.959
Caption: hopefully this one&#39;s obvious but it

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:21.439
Caption: really helps with communication skills

01:17:18.959 --> 01:17:23.520
Caption: because i cannot tell you the number of

01:17:21.439 --> 01:17:25.520
Caption: times in my career i have taught someone

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:28.159
Caption: what a for-loop is

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:30.560
Caption: and that doesn&#39;t sound hard

01:17:28.159 --> 01:17:32.479
Caption: but trust me i know this from experience

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:36.159
Caption: when you first start learning to code

01:17:32.479 --> 01:17:39.279
Caption: for loops are like mind-blowing they are

01:17:36.159 --> 01:17:42.000
Caption: absolutely magical i&#39;d say 90 of the

01:17:39.279 --> 01:17:43.759
Caption: people learning them and i&#39;d say 50 of

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.520
Caption: the people learning them do not

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:47.039
Caption: understand the way that i&#39;ve explained

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:48.399
Caption: it the first time and it doesn&#39;t matter

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.600
Caption: which way i pick to explain it they&#39;re

01:17:48.399 --> 01:17:51.040
Caption: not going to get it they need to hear it

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.199
Caption: a few different ways

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.439
Caption: and so through the process of teaching

01:17:53.199 --> 01:17:57.760
Caption: somebody else a particular skill you end

01:17:55.439 --> 01:17:59.359
Caption: up explaining that same thing over and

01:17:57.759 --> 01:18:01.599
Caption: over again but in different ways every

01:17:59.359 --> 01:18:02.879
Caption: single time and it ends up building up

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.120
Caption: to really good practice for your

01:18:02.879 --> 01:18:06.799
Caption: communication skills so now when i&#39;m

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.479
Caption: working on a dev team and i try and

01:18:06.799 --> 01:18:09.599
Caption: explain something to somebody else i

01:18:08.479 --> 01:18:11.600
Caption: know that i&#39;m probably going to be able

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.560
Caption: to explain it really well first time and

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.640
Caption: they&#39;re going to actually understand

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:17.199
Caption: what i&#39;m saying and that&#39;s all from just

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.640
Caption: practice of teaching people who ask me

01:18:17.199 --> 01:18:20.400
Caption: questions of why but how does that work

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.919
Caption: i don&#39;t understand it&#39;s just from

01:18:20.399 --> 01:18:24.158
Caption: practice of dealing with that for so

01:18:21.919 --> 01:18:24.158
Caption: long

01:18:24.799 --> 01:18:28.479
Caption: it&#39;s also helped me in that i&#39;ve learned

01:18:26.479 --> 01:18:29.520
Caption: that i really have to walk the walk and

01:18:28.479 --> 01:18:31.359
Caption: actually

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.760
Caption: do what i tell my apprentices or my

01:18:31.359 --> 01:18:36.639
Caption: juniors or whoever um i have to do what

01:18:33.759 --> 01:18:38.158
Caption: i tell them to do so i tell the

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:40.640
Caption: apprentices that i work at nvaru at the

01:18:38.159 --> 01:18:42.719
Caption: moment i tell them all the time just ask

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.000
Caption: questions just ask the question if you

01:18:42.719 --> 01:18:46.000
Caption: don&#39;t know something just ask the

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.080
Caption: question but then i found that i would

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.839
Caption: have a question and i would open our

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:52.159
Caption: engineering slack channel and think oh

01:18:49.839 --> 01:18:53.279
Caption: there&#39;s 150 engineers in here i don&#39;t

01:18:52.159 --> 01:18:54.800
Caption: want to ask the question because i&#39;m

01:18:53.279 --> 01:18:56.079
Caption: going to feel stupid and someone&#39;s going

01:18:54.799 --> 01:18:57.359
Caption: to roll their eyes like why are you

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.800
Caption: asked but i just realized you know i

01:18:57.359 --> 01:19:00.000
Caption: would tell my apprentices to post this

01:18:58.799 --> 01:19:01.678
Caption: question so i&#39;m just going to post the

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.199
Caption: question and no one has ever messaged me

01:19:01.679 --> 01:19:04.880
Caption: saying lola lol that was a dumb question

01:19:03.199 --> 01:19:06.320
Caption: like that doesn&#39;t happen what usually

01:19:04.879 --> 01:19:07.600
Caption: happens is someone says oh i&#39;m following

01:19:06.319 --> 01:19:09.279
Caption: this thread because i also don&#39;t know

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.320
Caption: the answer to this question so it&#39;s

01:19:09.279 --> 01:19:13.839
Caption: really helped me to get over my fear of

01:19:12.319 --> 01:19:15.040
Caption: asking questions like i just do it

01:19:13.839 --> 01:19:17.678
Caption: because i tell them to so i should

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:19.679
Caption: probably do the same

01:19:17.679 --> 01:19:21.280
Caption: it&#39;s also really helped me

01:19:19.679 --> 01:19:22.719
Caption: with imposter syndrome which is what i

01:19:21.279 --> 01:19:24.718
Caption: mentioned at the start of my talk this

01:19:22.719 --> 01:19:26.719
Caption: is why i feel like i finally like feel

01:19:24.719 --> 01:19:29.199
Caption: confident as a developer

01:19:26.719 --> 01:19:30.560
Caption: because i&#39;ve had to coach so many other

01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:32.320
Caption: people through imposter syndrome

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:33.919
Caption: particularly because most of my career

01:19:32.319 --> 01:19:35.359
Caption: has been focused on helping women get

01:19:33.919 --> 01:19:37.600
Caption: into tech in particular and we&#39;re

01:19:35.359 --> 01:19:39.919
Caption: atrocious for imposter syndrome so

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:42.320
Caption: coaching other people through that so

01:19:39.919 --> 01:19:44.399
Caption: often i finally started internalizing it

01:19:42.319 --> 01:19:46.639
Caption: to myself and my internal monologue has

01:19:44.399 --> 01:19:48.000
Caption: changed from oh what if they find out

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.760
Caption: i&#39;m not really a senior and i don&#39;t know

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.600
Caption: what i&#39;m doing to they hired me as a

01:19:49.759 --> 01:19:53.279
Caption: senior so i must be so i&#39;ll just call

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:54.879
Caption: myself one of those now and so the

01:19:53.279 --> 01:19:56.479
Caption: internal monologue it&#39;s totally

01:19:54.879 --> 01:19:57.520
Caption: different now and imposter syndrome is

01:19:56.479 --> 01:19:59.520
Caption: not really something that i struggle

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:01.040
Caption: with anymore except before this talk

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.640
Caption: when i&#39;m starting to freak out oh what

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:05.280
Caption: if no one comes so thank you so much for

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.880
Caption: coming

01:20:05.279 --> 01:20:09.359
Caption: i&#39;ve also become

01:20:06.879 --> 01:20:10.399
Caption: way more forgiving of my own knowledge

01:20:09.359 --> 01:20:12.080
Caption: gaps

01:20:10.399 --> 01:20:14.158
Caption: because when you first start teaching or

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:15.520
Caption: mentoring someone else especially if

01:20:14.159 --> 01:20:16.880
Caption: you&#39;re doing this like if you&#39;re giving

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:18.959
Caption: a presentation or a workshop or

01:20:16.879 --> 01:20:20.959
Caption: something like i feel

01:20:18.959 --> 01:20:23.040
Caption: like your biggest fear is someone&#39;s

01:20:20.959 --> 01:20:25.919
Caption: gonna ask me a question and i&#39;m gonna

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:27.679
Caption: have to google it in front of everybody

01:20:25.919 --> 01:20:29.198
Caption: and that&#39;s really scary because what if

01:20:27.679 --> 01:20:31.760
Caption: you can&#39;t figure it out and then you get

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:33.920
Caption: all flustered but now i&#39;ve learned that

01:20:31.759 --> 01:20:35.839
Caption: actually when someone asks me

01:20:33.919 --> 01:20:38.560
Caption: something and i don&#39;t know the answer

01:20:35.839 --> 01:20:40.158
Caption: which realistically is most of the time

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:41.600
Caption: i now just go cool this is now an

01:20:40.159 --> 01:20:43.120
Caption: exercise and learning how to google

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.399
Caption: things together so we&#39;re going to go and

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.919
Caption: do this research and see if we can

01:20:44.399 --> 01:20:47.520
Caption: figure it out together and this

01:20:45.919 --> 01:20:49.198
Caption: literally happened a couple weeks ago

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.640
Caption: the apprentices were so obsessed with

01:20:49.199 --> 01:20:52.800
Caption: trying to figure out how to use this

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:54.959
Caption: hook and react and i haven&#39;t used react

01:20:52.799 --> 01:20:57.520
Caption: in like 18 months so i didn&#39;t know how

01:20:54.959 --> 01:20:59.198
Caption: to do it so we spent two hours googling

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.719
Caption: trying to implement it didn&#39;t even

01:20:59.199 --> 01:21:02.159
Caption: figure it out in the end but i feel like

01:21:00.719 --> 01:21:04.560
Caption: they forgot that we were trying to make

01:21:02.159 --> 01:21:06.800
Caption: it work so it kind of ended up okay

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.319
Caption: so i&#39;ve become way more forgiving of my

01:21:06.799 --> 01:21:10.319
Caption: own knowledge gaps when they asked me

01:21:08.319 --> 01:21:12.560
Caption: that question and i i don&#39;t know how to

01:21:10.319 --> 01:21:14.238
Caption: do this it just became an exercise and

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:16.719
Caption: let&#39;s unpack this together and see if we

01:21:14.238 --> 01:21:18.639
Caption: can work it out together

01:21:16.719 --> 01:21:20.320
Caption: and i&#39;m just while the slide&#39;s on i&#39;m

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.560
Caption: going to chuck out a dangerous word

01:21:20.319 --> 01:21:24.158
Caption: there where i feel like a lot of people

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.600
Caption: they go the other way so instead of

01:21:24.159 --> 01:21:27.280
Caption: being scared of your knowledge gaps and

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:29.120
Caption: being scared of asked a question you&#39;ve

01:21:27.279 --> 01:21:31.119
Caption: got way too much confidence and that

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:32.719
Caption: mansplainer comes out in you so you

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:34.239
Caption: think i don&#39;t know the answer but i&#39;m

01:21:32.719 --> 01:21:35.679
Caption: not going to show them so i&#39;m going to

01:21:34.238 --> 01:21:37.759
Caption: talk with confidence about something

01:21:35.679 --> 01:21:40.239
Caption: completely irrelevant and then they

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:41.439
Caption: won&#39;t notice which is not true and it is

01:21:40.238 --> 01:21:43.039
Caption: not helpful

01:21:41.439 --> 01:21:45.600
Caption: so i&#39;ve become more comfortable with my

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:47.439
Caption: own knowledge gaps i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:49.600
Caption: been a mansplainer

01:21:47.439 --> 01:21:51.439
Caption: but i i don&#39;t think i have or a woman&#39;s

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.120
Caption: planner if you like but i certainly

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:54.319
Caption: would never do it now because i&#39;m okay

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:55.520
Caption: with just saying let&#39;s just google it

01:21:54.319 --> 01:21:58.479
Caption: let&#39;s just figure this out or just i

01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:00.879
Caption: don&#39;t know let&#39;s go with someone else

01:21:58.479 --> 01:22:03.359
Caption: so with that in mind

01:22:00.879 --> 01:22:05.359
Caption: i want to talk about how can you be an

01:22:03.359 --> 01:22:08.560
Caption: effective mentor because clearly these

01:22:05.359 --> 01:22:10.638
Caption: skills are helpful like i feel like i&#39;m

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:12.319
Caption: a pretty decent engineer and it&#39;s

01:22:10.639 --> 01:22:15.439
Caption: because i&#39;ve spent so much time teaching

01:22:12.319 --> 01:22:17.198
Caption: other people so let&#39;s unpack what do i

01:22:15.439 --> 01:22:18.799
Caption: actually do that&#39;s made me a good

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:20.479
Caption: teacher and therefore helped me with

01:22:18.799 --> 01:22:21.839
Caption: those skills um and hopefully therefore

01:22:20.479 --> 01:22:24.399
Caption: you can go back to work and feel like

01:22:21.839 --> 01:22:26.479
Caption: you can be a good mentor as well so

01:22:24.399 --> 01:22:29.279
Caption: something i would like to point out

01:22:26.479 --> 01:22:31.120
Caption: is that simply having knowledge does not

01:22:29.279 --> 01:22:32.799
Caption: make you a good teacher

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:35.360
Caption: and i actually put this in the slides

01:22:32.799 --> 01:22:37.279
Caption: because a couple weeks ago i was showing

01:22:35.359 --> 01:22:39.119
Caption: these slides to the apprentices and i

01:22:37.279 --> 01:22:40.479
Caption: said hey could you give me some ideas

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:42.479
Caption: what do you think i should mention in

01:22:40.479 --> 01:22:44.718
Caption: here and one of them

01:22:42.479 --> 01:22:46.718
Caption: instantly rolled her eyes in the most

01:22:44.719 --> 01:22:48.159
Caption: dramatic fashion i have ever seen and

01:22:46.719 --> 01:22:50.080
Caption: said oh

01:22:48.159 --> 01:22:52.080
Caption: i hate it when you meet those engineers

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:54.080
Caption: and they&#39;ve been in tech for like 15

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.560
Caption: years and so they think that they can

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:58.479
Caption: teach and they can&#39;t and clearly this

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.199
Caption: person has been burned

01:22:58.479 --> 01:23:00.799
Caption: and

01:22:59.199 --> 01:23:02.960
Caption: and i think we all have i think

01:23:00.799 --> 01:23:04.959
Caption: everybody can probably think about that

01:23:02.959 --> 01:23:06.799
Caption: person that they&#39;ve interacted with who

01:23:04.959 --> 01:23:09.040
Caption: clearly thinks they are the absolute

01:23:06.799 --> 01:23:11.040
Caption: bee&#39;s knees because they know everything

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:12.639
Caption: about this one particular topic but they

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:14.319
Caption: could not explain it to you to save

01:23:12.639 --> 01:23:16.320
Caption: their life but they have the confidence

01:23:14.319 --> 01:23:18.799
Caption: to think they can so i would like to

01:23:16.319 --> 01:23:20.718
Caption: point out that having knowledge does not

01:23:18.799 --> 01:23:23.198
Caption: make you a good teacher

01:23:20.719 --> 01:23:27.120
Caption: which leads me to this dumb expression

01:23:23.199 --> 01:23:29.600
Caption: those who can&#39;t do teach this is such an

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:32.800
Caption: embarrassing excuse this is what i like

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:34.399
Caption: to say instead those who know do

01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:35.359
Caption: those that understand

01:23:34.399 --> 01:23:37.678
Caption: teach

01:23:35.359 --> 01:23:39.520
Caption: it is one thing to know about a

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:40.479
Caption: particular concept or library or

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.159
Caption: whatever

01:23:40.479 --> 01:23:44.000
Caption: it is another thing to have the

01:23:42.159 --> 01:23:47.439
Caption: understanding and have the skills to

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.359
Caption: actually teach it to somebody else

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:51.439
Caption: these are not the same thing

01:23:49.359 --> 01:23:53.439
Caption: and i get so angry when people say those

01:23:51.439 --> 01:23:54.959
Caption: who can&#39;t do teach because i&#39;m a teacher

01:23:53.439 --> 01:23:56.479
Caption: and i know what i&#39;m doing and i have a

01:23:54.959 --> 01:23:58.000
Caption: pretty good understanding usually of the

01:23:56.479 --> 01:23:59.520
Caption: things that i&#39;m teaching because i&#39;ve

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.279
Caption: got that deeper understanding because i

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.439
Caption: was prepared for that really terrifying

01:24:01.279 --> 01:24:06.000
Caption: why did you do that question so those

01:24:03.439 --> 01:24:07.520
Caption: who know do those who understand can

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.759
Caption: also teach

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:12.080
Caption: so with that in mind how do you become

01:24:09.759 --> 01:24:13.359
Caption: an effective mentor so maybe you have

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:15.359
Caption: all the knowledge but how do you

01:24:13.359 --> 01:24:18.479
Caption: actually have enough understanding to

01:24:15.359 --> 01:24:20.799
Caption: teach that to someone else

01:24:18.479 --> 01:24:22.080
Caption: so before we run through these skills um

01:24:20.799 --> 01:24:23.198
Caption: i just want to point out that there are

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:25.839
Caption: lots of different places where

01:24:23.199 --> 01:24:27.120
Caption: mentorship happens because after i give

01:24:25.839 --> 01:24:28.799
Caption: a talk like this someone always comes

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:29.760
Caption: and asks me for an opportunity so here

01:24:28.799 --> 01:24:32.879
Caption: they are

01:24:29.759 --> 01:24:34.959
Caption: so at work you might have an informal or

01:24:32.879 --> 01:24:36.959
Caption: a formal mentorship program we actually

01:24:34.959 --> 01:24:39.279
Caption: do this at envato um and i have two

01:24:36.959 --> 01:24:41.439
Caption: little mentees at the moment and that

01:24:39.279 --> 01:24:44.000
Caption: comes about just because usually someone

01:24:41.439 --> 01:24:45.759
Caption: says to their manager i&#39;m feeling like

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.679
Caption: i&#39;m missing skills in this particular

01:24:45.759 --> 01:24:49.039
Caption: thing and the manager goes great well i

01:24:47.679 --> 01:24:51.040
Caption: probably can&#39;t help you but maybe we

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.959
Caption: could find someone who can and bam

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:55.120
Caption: suddenly i&#39;m getting a dm and now i have

01:24:52.959 --> 01:24:58.000
Caption: a mentee so at the moment i&#39;m mentoring

01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:00.000
Caption: someone on how to speak at conferences

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.759
Caption: so give me some good feedback so i can

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.319
Caption: go back into that next mentoring session

01:25:01.759 --> 01:25:07.198
Caption: with some confidence please and also uh

01:25:04.319 --> 01:25:09.040
Caption: someone wants to upskill their um

01:25:07.199 --> 01:25:11.120
Caption: their knowledge of ruby on rails and so

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:13.120
Caption: very different things i&#39;m not an expert

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:16.000
Caption: in either of those things um but i know

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:17.199
Caption: how to be a good mentor so if you are at

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.040
Caption: work and there&#39;s something that you want

01:25:17.199 --> 01:25:20.639
Caption: to learn or maybe you see someone has a

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.319
Caption: knowledge gap or maybe an em has

01:25:20.639 --> 01:25:24.080
Caption: mentioned to you or an engineering

01:25:22.319 --> 01:25:25.198
Caption: manager has mentioned to you hey do you

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.719
Caption: think you&#39;ll be able to help this person

01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:28.719
Caption: with this particular thing that&#39;s an

01:25:26.719 --> 01:25:30.639
Caption: opportunity to actually create some kind

01:25:28.719 --> 01:25:32.719
Caption: of system around it and create some more

01:25:30.639 --> 01:25:34.159
Caption: formalized mentoring

01:25:32.719 --> 01:25:35.600
Caption: there&#39;s also you could pair with other

01:25:34.159 --> 01:25:37.040
Caption: least experienced developers on your

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:39.040
Caption: team which i really hope that you

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:41.600
Caption: already do so if someone&#39;s stuck with

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:43.760
Caption: something you can have a pairing session

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.919
Caption: with them to work it out

01:25:43.759 --> 01:25:47.519
Caption: onboarding new team members is the best

01:25:45.919 --> 01:25:48.799
Caption: opportunity because someone who&#39;s brand

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.919
Caption: new to the team doesn&#39;t know what

01:25:48.799 --> 01:25:51.359
Caption: they&#39;re doing and doesn&#39;t know all the

01:25:49.919 --> 01:25:53.839
Caption: systems they need so this is a really

01:25:51.359 --> 01:25:55.678
Caption: great opportunity to practice mentoring

01:25:53.839 --> 01:25:57.439
Caption: and you could also give team

01:25:55.679 --> 01:26:00.000
Caption: presentations so maybe you have a

01:25:57.439 --> 01:26:02.319
Caption: company that is like lunch and learns um

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.399
Caption: or maybe you&#39;ve just created a really

01:26:02.319 --> 01:26:05.678
Caption: complicated pr so instead of just

01:26:04.399 --> 01:26:07.198
Caption: putting the pr up and hoping for the

01:26:05.679 --> 01:26:08.560
Caption: best maybe you could run a presentation

01:26:07.199 --> 01:26:10.159
Caption: of actually running people through that

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:12.399
Caption: pr

01:26:10.159 --> 01:26:14.560
Caption: so that&#39;s at work there&#39;s also community

01:26:12.399 --> 01:26:16.319
Caption: opportunities to be a mentor so for

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:18.159
Caption: example you could speak up meetups or

01:26:16.319 --> 01:26:20.158
Caption: conferences this feels like a good

01:26:18.159 --> 01:26:22.320
Caption: enough example of that you can also

01:26:20.159 --> 01:26:23.920
Caption: tutor at public coding workshops or you

01:26:22.319 --> 01:26:26.399
Caption: could tutor or teach at things like boot

01:26:23.919 --> 01:26:27.759
Caption: camps so off the top of my head i came

01:26:26.399 --> 01:26:29.600
Caption: up with a list of places like that that

01:26:27.759 --> 01:26:31.519
Caption: do that so she codes general assembly

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.359
Caption: codecamp codemaster institute i think

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.839
Caption: all of those places have opportunities

01:26:33.359 --> 01:26:37.439
Caption: in perth to actually mentor she codes in

01:26:35.839 --> 01:26:38.959
Caption: particular they&#39;re like literally around

01:26:37.439 --> 01:26:40.000
Caption: the corner go and ask them when the next

01:26:38.959 --> 01:26:41.520
Caption: workshop is because they&#39;re always

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.799
Caption: looking for mentors

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:44.239
Caption: can you tell i used to work there i&#39;m

01:26:42.799 --> 01:26:46.479
Caption: just slightly biased

01:26:44.238 --> 01:26:48.879
Caption: so there are plenty of opportunities to

01:26:46.479 --> 01:26:50.399
Caption: be a mentor saying i haven&#39;t had the

01:26:48.879 --> 01:26:52.479
Caption: opportunity is

01:26:50.399 --> 01:26:54.479
Caption: not good enough there are opportunities

01:26:52.479 --> 01:26:55.199
Caption: all around you

01:26:54.479 --> 01:26:57.679
Caption: so

01:26:55.199 --> 01:27:00.080
Caption: what is your actual role as a mentor

01:26:57.679 --> 01:27:02.719
Caption: like what is your job as a mentor

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:06.000
Caption: your job is to help a mentee discover

01:27:02.719 --> 01:27:07.840
Caption: ideas and solve problems for themselves

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.080
Caption: so in other words

01:27:07.839 --> 01:27:11.919
Caption: it&#39;s not your job to provide solutions

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:14.000
Caption: that&#39;s not useful your job is to help

01:27:11.919 --> 01:27:15.678
Caption: somebody else to figure out what

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.199
Caption: problems they&#39;re actually facing and

01:27:15.679 --> 01:27:19.840
Caption: then figure out how to solve those

01:27:17.199 --> 01:27:21.120
Caption: problems so if you&#39;re a visual person

01:27:19.839 --> 01:27:22.718
Caption: person

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.919
Caption: this is this is what i don&#39;t want you to

01:27:22.719 --> 01:27:25.280
Caption: do so

01:27:23.919 --> 01:27:26.879
Caption: sometimes someone needs help with

01:27:25.279 --> 01:27:27.919
Caption: something maybe they&#39;ve got a bug and

01:27:26.879 --> 01:27:29.040
Caption: they can&#39;t get the code running or

01:27:27.919 --> 01:27:30.959
Caption: whatever

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:32.560
Caption: you provide a solution the code is

01:27:30.959 --> 01:27:34.879
Caption: running and you pat yourself on the back

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:37.040
Caption: and go sweet i solved the problem i mean

01:27:34.879 --> 01:27:40.158
Caption: great but you actually didn&#39;t

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:41.839
Caption: really help anyone you solve this one

01:27:40.159 --> 01:27:43.280
Caption: particular problem but did you give them

01:27:41.839 --> 01:27:45.599
Caption: the skills to be able to figure out how

01:27:43.279 --> 01:27:47.039
Caption: to solve it next time i don&#39;t think so

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:49.600
Caption: did you get anything out of that

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:51.600
Caption: interaction like did you

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:52.800
Caption: learn how this person learns and so how

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.399
Caption: you might better come at them with

01:27:52.799 --> 01:27:56.638
Caption: solving a problem next time i don&#39;t

01:27:54.399 --> 01:27:58.319
Caption: think so in general this is a really

01:27:56.639 --> 01:28:00.719
Caption: quick fix and it helps no one in the

01:27:58.319 --> 01:28:02.879
Caption: long run so i&#39;m going to show you

01:28:00.719 --> 01:28:04.880
Caption: instead a flowchart of what i used to

01:28:02.879 --> 01:28:06.080
Caption: mentor other people and it&#39;s a little

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:08.399
Caption: bit intimidating but it&#39;s okay we&#39;re

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.199
Caption: going to walk through i did my best

01:28:08.399 --> 01:28:10.959
Caption: so

01:28:09.199 --> 01:28:12.320
Caption: this is what happens whenever someone at

01:28:10.959 --> 01:28:14.718
Caption: work comes to me with a problem that

01:28:12.319 --> 01:28:16.560
Caption: they would like help with so they come

01:28:14.719 --> 01:28:18.639
Caption: to me uh they&#39;re confused about a

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:20.239
Caption: particular concept or task so we&#39;re

01:28:18.639 --> 01:28:21.679
Caption: going to whoa i can do this we&#39;re going

01:28:20.238 --> 01:28:24.638
Caption: to start up here so they come to me

01:28:21.679 --> 01:28:26.159
Caption: confused about a particular context

01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:27.679
Caption: concept or task

01:28:26.159 --> 01:28:30.400
Caption: so the very first thing that i&#39;m going

01:28:27.679 --> 01:28:32.080
Caption: to do oh i can do this is i&#39;m not going

01:28:30.399 --> 01:28:33.040
Caption: to grab the laptop and start digging and

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.199
Caption: figure out what&#39;s going on i&#39;m going to

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:36.879
Caption: ask them some clarifying questions

01:28:35.199 --> 01:28:38.880
Caption: and the reason i&#39;m going to do that is

01:28:36.879 --> 01:28:40.638
Caption: because quite often when i&#39;m mentoring

01:28:38.879 --> 01:28:42.080
Caption: there&#39;s a couple of things that happen

01:28:40.639 --> 01:28:44.320
Caption: someone might use a bunch of really

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:45.600
Caption: fancy terminology but it turns out that

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:47.439
Caption: they actually don&#39;t know what those

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:48.639
Caption: words meant and it&#39;s impressive that

01:28:47.439 --> 01:28:51.678
Caption: they managed to get the sentence

01:28:48.639 --> 01:28:53.040
Caption: together it would be really easy to fall

01:28:51.679 --> 01:28:54.880
Caption: for that and think that that means that

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:56.319
Caption: they know what they&#39;re talking about and

01:28:54.879 --> 01:28:58.638
Caption: i&#39;m not trying to shame the person in

01:28:56.319 --> 01:29:00.479
Caption: this situation because great they used a

01:28:58.639 --> 01:29:02.159
Caption: bunch of really cool terminology what

01:29:00.479 --> 01:29:03.759
Caption: i&#39;m trying to figure out is how far back

01:29:02.159 --> 01:29:05.360
Caption: do i need to go to actually explain

01:29:03.759 --> 01:29:07.519
Caption: things so if they&#39;ve picked up a word

01:29:05.359 --> 01:29:08.879
Caption: but they&#39;ve used it in their own context

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:10.159
Caption: you need to help them with that you need

01:29:08.879 --> 01:29:11.678
Caption: to solve that so they don&#39;t do that

01:29:10.159 --> 01:29:13.520
Caption: again

01:29:11.679 --> 01:29:15.840
Caption: or the other thing that can happen is

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.839
Caption: someone has the concept figured out but

01:29:15.839 --> 01:29:19.678
Caption: they don&#39;t have the words to describe it

01:29:17.839 --> 01:29:21.520
Caption: so in this case they know the concept

01:29:19.679 --> 01:29:23.440
Caption: they don&#39;t know the terminology to use

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.760
Caption: which makes it really hard to actually

01:29:23.439 --> 01:29:27.279
Caption: form a question so in that case you&#39;re

01:29:25.759 --> 01:29:29.279
Caption: going to ask them some more clarifying

01:29:27.279 --> 01:29:31.119
Caption: questions to figure out which of those

01:29:29.279 --> 01:29:32.718
Caption: categories does this person fit into if

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.520
Caption: either of them and you&#39;re going to work

01:29:32.719 --> 01:29:35.440
Caption: out

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:37.199
Caption: what are they actually asking me what do

01:29:35.439 --> 01:29:38.560
Caption: they need help with

01:29:37.199 --> 01:29:39.920
Caption: in your job

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.280
Caption: and actually this is something that

01:29:39.919 --> 01:29:43.040
Caption: again apprentice said to me a couple

01:29:41.279 --> 01:29:45.678
Caption: weeks ago is

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:47.919
Caption: it&#39;s a real skill to meet someone at the

01:29:45.679 --> 01:29:50.080
Caption: level that they are at

01:29:47.919 --> 01:29:52.000
Caption: just because you feel super confident in

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:53.439
Caption: this particular concept it doesn&#39;t mean

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.600
Caption: that you get to go on a rant about how

01:29:53.439 --> 01:29:58.238
Caption: this thing works your job is to figure

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:59.439
Caption: out what this person is actually asking

01:29:58.238 --> 01:30:01.519
Caption: and then give them the answer

01:29:59.439 --> 01:30:02.639
Caption: appropriate to their level and even if

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:04.719
Caption: you&#39;re like

01:30:02.639 --> 01:30:06.159
Caption: itching to tell them more until tell

01:30:04.719 --> 01:30:07.679
Caption: them about the founder who wrote this

01:30:06.159 --> 01:30:08.880
Caption: thing and then the history of oh then

01:30:07.679 --> 01:30:10.800
Caption: this happened and then we merged this

01:30:08.879 --> 01:30:12.238
Caption: new version 12 with blah blah not useful

01:30:10.799 --> 01:30:13.439
Caption: your job is to match the level that

01:30:12.238 --> 01:30:15.359
Caption: they&#39;re at and give them the exact

01:30:13.439 --> 01:30:17.198
Caption: amount of information that they need

01:30:15.359 --> 01:30:19.520
Caption: which leads us to the next step so i

01:30:17.199 --> 01:30:21.199
Caption: want you to provide an explanation so

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:23.919
Caption: once you&#39;ve figured out

01:30:21.199 --> 01:30:25.280
Caption: what uh what they&#39;re actually asking you

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:26.799
Caption: because you&#39;ve asked those clarifying

01:30:25.279 --> 01:30:28.319
Caption: questions you&#39;re going to provide an

01:30:26.799 --> 01:30:30.000
Caption: explanation

01:30:28.319 --> 01:30:31.919
Caption: and if you don&#39;t know the answer to the

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.759
Caption: question you&#39;re not going to act with

01:30:31.919 --> 01:30:35.439
Caption: confidence and just give them an

01:30:33.759 --> 01:30:37.359
Caption: explanation you&#39;re going to google it

01:30:35.439 --> 01:30:38.959
Caption: with them and together you&#39;re going to

01:30:37.359 --> 01:30:40.959
Caption: build an explanation and you&#39;re going to

01:30:38.959 --> 01:30:42.959
Caption: try and work out

01:30:40.959 --> 01:30:44.718
Caption: how to actually explain the thing that

01:30:42.959 --> 01:30:46.399
Caption: they don&#39;t understand and i do this all

01:30:44.719 --> 01:30:47.920
Caption: the time i say i have no idea what

01:30:46.399 --> 01:30:50.158
Caption: you&#39;re talking about but the internet

01:30:47.919 --> 01:30:51.839
Caption: does and so we go and we look up some

01:30:50.159 --> 01:30:53.679
Caption: blog posts or find some youtube videos

01:30:51.839 --> 01:30:55.919
Caption: we learn about it together and then we

01:30:53.679 --> 01:30:57.520
Caption: unpack it together

01:30:55.919 --> 01:30:58.799
Caption: so once you&#39;ve done that you&#39;re then

01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:00.799
Caption: going to do

01:30:58.799 --> 01:31:03.279
Caption: you&#39;re then going to confirm oh god

01:31:00.799 --> 01:31:04.079
Caption: you&#39;re going to confirm understanding

01:31:03.279 --> 01:31:05.279
Caption: so

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:07.359
Caption: you&#39;re not just going to go and read

01:31:05.279 --> 01:31:09.439
Caption: blog posts figure it out give a

01:31:07.359 --> 01:31:11.678
Caption: monologue assume they understood and

01:31:09.439 --> 01:31:13.520
Caption: then carry on you&#39;re going to ask them

01:31:11.679 --> 01:31:14.959
Caption: some more questions you&#39;re going to make

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:17.120
Caption: sure they actually understood what you

01:31:14.959 --> 01:31:18.560
Caption: just unpacked and quite often i&#39;ll ask

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:20.719
Caption: them the exact same question that they

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:23.359
Caption: came to me with and if they can answer

01:31:20.719 --> 01:31:25.280
Caption: it confidently sweet i&#39;ve done my job

01:31:23.359 --> 01:31:27.198
Caption: they now understand this thing but if

01:31:25.279 --> 01:31:28.879
Caption: they&#39;re if they can mostly pull an

01:31:27.199 --> 01:31:30.159
Caption: answer together but maybe they still use

01:31:28.879 --> 01:31:31.520
Caption: the wrong terminology maybe they&#39;ve

01:31:30.159 --> 01:31:32.800
Caption: forgotten a word maybe it doesn&#39;t

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:35.040
Caption: actually quite make sense in this

01:31:32.799 --> 01:31:36.559
Caption: particular context in other words

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:38.399
Caption: they&#39;re still confused then you&#39;re going

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:39.679
Caption: to ask them some more questions you&#39;re

01:31:38.399 --> 01:31:41.919
Caption: going to try and figure out where are

01:31:39.679 --> 01:31:43.679
Caption: they at now and what blanks do i need to

01:31:41.919 --> 01:31:45.520
Caption: fill in now

01:31:43.679 --> 01:31:47.679
Caption: and you might go through this process

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:49.279
Caption: many times so you ask a question you

01:31:47.679 --> 01:31:50.959
Caption: give an explanation you&#39;ll confirm the

01:31:49.279 --> 01:31:52.879
Caption: understanding they&#39;re still confused so

01:31:50.959 --> 01:31:54.560
Caption: you&#39;re gonna go ask questions again and

01:31:52.879 --> 01:31:56.399
Caption: that&#39;s where that skill of being able to

01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:58.719
Caption: explain something in multiple different

01:31:56.399 --> 01:32:00.399
Caption: ways comes in because you can&#39;t just

01:31:58.719 --> 01:32:01.600
Caption: give an explanation confirm

01:32:00.399 --> 01:32:03.359
Caption: understanding find out they&#39;re still

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:05.359
Caption: confused and give the exact same

01:32:03.359 --> 01:32:07.439
Caption: explanation and expect there to be a

01:32:05.359 --> 01:32:09.520
Caption: different result it&#39;s literally the

01:32:07.439 --> 01:32:10.959
Caption: definition of insanity so you&#39;re going

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:13.679
Caption: to practice giving a different kind of

01:32:10.959 --> 01:32:15.600
Caption: explanation instead

01:32:13.679 --> 01:32:17.199
Caption: so once you&#39;ve finally confirmed their

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:18.479
Caption: understanding

01:32:17.199 --> 01:32:20.239
Caption: and i&#39;d like to point out that even

01:32:18.479 --> 01:32:21.120
Caption: though i&#39;ve written make sense there

01:32:20.238 --> 01:32:23.198
Caption: you&#39;re going to confirm their

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:25.439
Caption: understanding by doing anything except

01:32:23.199 --> 01:32:26.719
Caption: asking does that make sense because

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:27.919
Caption: chances are the person&#39;s just going to

01:32:26.719 --> 01:32:29.520
Caption: say yes because that feels like how

01:32:27.919 --> 01:32:31.120
Caption: you&#39;re meant to answer that question not

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:32.479
Caption: useful so you can ask them a bunch of

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:34.000
Caption: other questions and determine for

01:32:32.479 --> 01:32:35.439
Caption: yourself whether that seems to have made

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.479
Caption: sense for them

01:32:35.439 --> 01:32:38.399
Caption: and then you&#39;re going to move on to

01:32:36.479 --> 01:32:40.159
Caption: actually solving the problem if there is

01:32:38.399 --> 01:32:42.158
Caption: one because at this point they might

01:32:40.159 --> 01:32:43.760
Caption: have a solution just the explanation

01:32:42.159 --> 01:32:46.000
Caption: that you&#39;ve given might have given them

01:32:43.759 --> 01:32:48.479
Caption: enough information to go with so they

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.799
Caption: have a solution so they need to move on

01:32:48.479 --> 01:32:52.479
Caption: otherwise if they don&#39;t have a solution

01:32:50.799 --> 01:32:54.079
Caption: now you&#39;re going to guide them to one

01:32:52.479 --> 01:32:56.080
Caption: and again you might be pulling out blog

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:58.000
Caption: posts you might be finding other files

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:59.120
Caption: in the repo to share them too but you&#39;re

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.040
Caption: going to help them figure out a

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:02.320
Caption: potential solution you&#39;re not going to

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:03.760
Caption: give it to them you&#39;re going to have

01:33:02.319 --> 01:33:05.198
Caption: chats you&#39;re going to have brainstorms

01:33:03.759 --> 01:33:07.919
Caption: you&#39;re going to help them figure it out

01:33:05.199 --> 01:33:08.800
Caption: for themselves but before you leave them

01:33:07.919 --> 01:33:10.560
Caption: you&#39;re going to confirm their

01:33:08.799 --> 01:33:11.759
Caption: understanding again you&#39;re going to make

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:13.839
Caption: sure that they understand what they

01:33:11.759 --> 01:33:16.000
Caption: actually need to do now to solve that

01:33:13.839 --> 01:33:17.279
Caption: problem so they might even tell you the

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.238
Caption: exact same thing that you just told them

01:33:17.279 --> 01:33:19.839
Caption: but there might be a little bit more

01:33:18.238 --> 01:33:21.119
Caption: confidence in their voice so you can say

01:33:19.839 --> 01:33:22.399
Caption: i&#39;m going to go look at this particular

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:24.080
Caption: repo i&#39;m going to find this example

01:33:22.399 --> 01:33:25.359
Caption: because i know that we did it here i&#39;m

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:26.879
Caption: going to look at this pr that put it up

01:33:25.359 --> 01:33:28.479
Caption: to see the notes so they might give you

01:33:26.879 --> 01:33:30.080
Caption: a full explanation great that means

01:33:28.479 --> 01:33:32.080
Caption: they&#39;ve understood if they&#39;re still a

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:33.280
Caption: bit hazy they&#39;re not okay to be left

01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:34.719
Caption: alone yet because you&#39;re just going to

01:33:33.279 --> 01:33:36.079
Caption: leave them in a state of confusion which

01:33:34.719 --> 01:33:37.440
Caption: is not what you want to do so you might

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:39.359
Caption: go through this cycle over and over

01:33:37.439 --> 01:33:41.359
Caption: again as well

01:33:39.359 --> 01:33:43.040
Caption: so finally once they have a solution and

01:33:41.359 --> 01:33:44.638
Caption: they feel confident you&#39;re going to time

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.439
Caption: box them

01:33:44.639 --> 01:33:47.360
Caption: so

01:33:45.439 --> 01:33:49.279
Caption: depending on the complexity of the tasks

01:33:47.359 --> 01:33:50.560
Caption: that you&#39;re giving them that time box

01:33:49.279 --> 01:33:53.119
Caption: could be i&#39;m going to come back to you

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.199
Caption: in 10 minutes it could be i&#39;m going to

01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:56.560
Caption: ask you you know tomorrow how that thing

01:33:55.199 --> 01:33:57.840
Caption: went so you&#39;re just going to judge it

01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:00.000
Caption: for yourself to see how complex the

01:33:57.839 --> 01:34:02.399
Caption: thing is so for example a couple weeks

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.600
Caption: ago i was paired with someone who

01:34:02.399 --> 01:34:05.520
Caption: was stuck on something to do with our

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.479
Caption: build pipeline

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.959
Caption: um

01:34:06.479 --> 01:34:10.560
Caption: and as i went through this process

01:34:08.959 --> 01:34:11.520
Caption: uh it probably took me longer than it

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:13.280
Caption: should have but as we went through this

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:14.799
Caption: process i realized oh this person

01:34:13.279 --> 01:34:16.879
Caption: actually doesn&#39;t know where buildkite

01:34:14.799 --> 01:34:18.718
Caption: fits in and how that connects to github

01:34:16.879 --> 01:34:21.279
Caption: and how these things talk to each other

01:34:18.719 --> 01:34:22.480
Caption: so i&#39;m going to give her 10 minutes i&#39;m

01:34:21.279 --> 01:34:24.319
Caption: going to say i need you to go to some

01:34:22.479 --> 01:34:25.839
Caption: reading on this particular thing here&#39;s

01:34:24.319 --> 01:34:27.359
Caption: the page of the docs i&#39;d suggest you

01:34:25.839 --> 01:34:29.040
Caption: read in 10 minutes i&#39;m going to come

01:34:27.359 --> 01:34:30.799
Caption: back and we&#39;re just going to see

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:32.479
Caption: see how you&#39;re going

01:34:30.799 --> 01:34:34.399
Caption: 10 minutes and she could explain it she

01:34:32.479 --> 01:34:36.560
Caption: had that aha moment everything sunken

01:34:34.399 --> 01:34:38.000
Caption: she now understood which was great it

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:39.679
Caption: means that we could repeat this process

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.279
Caption: all over again so you&#39;re going to time

01:34:39.679 --> 01:34:42.719
Caption: box a task so for me that was go read

01:34:41.279 --> 01:34:44.000
Caption: these docs

01:34:42.719 --> 01:34:45.360
Caption: then once you&#39;ve done that and you&#39;ve

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.679
Caption: checked in with them you&#39;re now going to

01:34:45.359 --> 01:34:50.399
Caption: consider frustration versus fun

01:34:47.679 --> 01:34:52.000
Caption: is this person still having fun kat was

01:34:50.399 --> 01:34:53.600
Caption: having the best time because she&#39;s

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.479
Caption: really into infrastructure and having

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:58.879
Caption: that aha moment was great for her so she

01:34:56.479 --> 01:35:00.799
Caption: was ready to just ask the next question

01:34:58.879 --> 01:35:03.439
Caption: be guided to a solution and then carry

01:35:00.799 --> 01:35:05.839
Caption: on time box another 20 minutes move on

01:35:03.439 --> 01:35:07.678
Caption: if the person is no longer if the person

01:35:05.839 --> 01:35:09.198
Caption: is no longer having fun so they&#39;re

01:35:07.679 --> 01:35:10.800
Caption: really frustrated and they&#39;re feeling

01:35:09.199 --> 01:35:12.320
Caption: kind of dumb they felt like if they

01:35:10.799 --> 01:35:13.919
Caption: haven&#39;t made progress

01:35:12.319 --> 01:35:15.839
Caption: well then you&#39;re not just going to put

01:35:13.919 --> 01:35:17.198
Caption: them into this loop of continuing to

01:35:15.839 --> 01:35:18.479
Caption: feel dumb you&#39;re going to go back to the

01:35:17.199 --> 01:35:19.760
Caption: very beginning you&#39;re going to ask them

01:35:18.479 --> 01:35:21.520
Caption: more questions because maybe you didn&#39;t

01:35:19.759 --> 01:35:22.879
Caption: nail it the first time maybe they didn&#39;t

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:24.319
Caption: actually know what they needed to ask

01:35:22.879 --> 01:35:26.080
Caption: the first time so you&#39;re going to go

01:35:24.319 --> 01:35:27.040
Caption: back through it all over again but this

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.040
Caption: time you&#39;re going to give some more

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:30.719
Caption: hints you&#39;re going to give them a little

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:32.639
Caption: bit more clues you&#39;re going to give them

01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:34.719
Caption: the specific section of the docs the

01:35:32.639 --> 01:35:36.080
Caption: specific line in the file the specific

01:35:34.719 --> 01:35:37.440
Caption: part of that pr or whatever you&#39;re

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.719
Caption: sharing with them you&#39;re going to give

01:35:37.439 --> 01:35:40.959
Caption: them more clues and you&#39;re going to go

01:35:38.719 --> 01:35:42.639
Caption: through the process again

01:35:40.959 --> 01:35:45.279
Caption: if you do and you get to the end and the

01:35:42.639 --> 01:35:46.639
Caption: person is now just properly upset and

01:35:45.279 --> 01:35:48.479
Caption: ready to throw their laptop out the

01:35:46.639 --> 01:35:49.520
Caption: window because we have all been there

01:35:48.479 --> 01:35:50.639
Caption: then you&#39;re just going to give them the

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:52.799
Caption: solution

01:35:50.639 --> 01:35:54.560
Caption: and i&#39;m going to tell you that sometimes

01:35:52.799 --> 01:35:56.479
Caption: even though i said don&#39;t do this

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:57.520
Caption: sometimes you just have to give them the

01:35:56.479 --> 01:35:58.959
Caption: solution

01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:00.719
Caption: it&#39;s not their day

01:35:58.959 --> 01:36:02.238
Caption: it&#39;s friday afternoon and they&#39;re really

01:36:00.719 --> 01:36:04.000
Caption: tired because learning how to do these

01:36:02.238 --> 01:36:05.359
Caption: things is really complicated that&#39;s

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.439
Caption: totally fine

01:36:05.359 --> 01:36:08.959
Caption: chances are they have learned something

01:36:07.439 --> 01:36:11.120
Caption: from this process but they&#39;re now

01:36:08.959 --> 01:36:12.879
Caption: fatigued of learning new things and you

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:14.080
Caption: need to help them out a little bit more

01:36:12.879 --> 01:36:15.919
Caption: but now you&#39;ve both built this

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:18.000
Caption: relationship and understand this process

01:36:15.919 --> 01:36:19.520
Caption: of how you&#39;re supposed what is a useful

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.279
Caption: way to help someone so you&#39;re still

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:22.479
Caption: going to try it again next time and

01:36:21.279 --> 01:36:23.839
Caption: chances are they&#39;re going to be a bit

01:36:22.479 --> 01:36:24.959
Caption: fresher they&#39;re going to come and know

01:36:23.839 --> 01:36:27.678
Caption: you&#39;re about to ask me a bunch of

01:36:24.959 --> 01:36:29.198
Caption: questions so i&#39;ve got

01:36:27.679 --> 01:36:30.880
Caption: the answers to those questions already

01:36:29.199 --> 01:36:32.239
Caption: which an apprentice surprised me with

01:36:30.879 --> 01:36:34.718
Caption: because she did that to me a couple of

01:36:32.238 --> 01:36:36.000
Caption: weeks ago so this process

01:36:34.719 --> 01:36:37.840
Caption: works

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.759
Caption: until someone&#39;s really frustrated in

01:36:37.839 --> 01:36:41.279
Caption: which case it&#39;s totally fine just give

01:36:39.759 --> 01:36:43.359
Caption: them the answer

01:36:41.279 --> 01:36:45.439
Caption: just next time you&#39;ll try again we&#39;ve

01:36:43.359 --> 01:36:46.959
Caption: all been in that situation where for me

01:36:45.439 --> 01:36:48.560
Caption: it&#39;s monday mornings i don&#39;t know my

01:36:46.959 --> 01:36:51.439
Caption: brain&#39;s not on like i&#39;m not learning

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:52.479
Caption: anything so just give me the answer

01:36:51.439 --> 01:36:54.159
Caption: and while you&#39;re going through this

01:36:52.479 --> 01:36:56.080
Caption: process there&#39;s a couple of things that

01:36:54.159 --> 01:36:57.600
Caption: i want you to remember

01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:59.119
Caption: so i want you to remember to have

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.919
Caption: compassion

01:36:59.119 --> 01:37:04.639
Caption: the earlier someone is in their career

01:37:01.919 --> 01:37:06.560
Caption: the easier it is to suffer with that oh

01:37:04.639 --> 01:37:07.760
Caption: i&#39;m so dumb and everybody else knows

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.119
Caption: more than me

01:37:07.759 --> 01:37:10.399
Caption: and the longer you&#39;ve been in your

01:37:09.119 --> 01:37:12.479
Caption: career probably the more that you&#39;ve

01:37:10.399 --> 01:37:14.158
Caption: forgotten that this was you too like for

01:37:12.479 --> 01:37:15.600
Caption: example

01:37:14.159 --> 01:37:17.280
Caption: do you remember what it was like

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:19.280
Caption: navigating your code editor for the

01:37:17.279 --> 01:37:21.678
Caption: first time you opened a repository with

01:37:19.279 --> 01:37:23.039
Caption: thousands of files in it

01:37:21.679 --> 01:37:24.560
Caption: probably not

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:26.239
Caption: but to someone who&#39;s just done that for

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:28.319
Caption: the first time

01:37:26.238 --> 01:37:30.079
Caption: that is so hard

01:37:28.319 --> 01:37:31.439
Caption: even if they&#39;ve you know they&#39;ve done a

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:33.280
Caption: bootcamp and they&#39;ve learned how to use

01:37:31.439 --> 01:37:35.439
Caption: this particular framework that is not

01:37:33.279 --> 01:37:37.439
Caption: the same when there are thousands and

01:37:35.439 --> 01:37:40.000
Caption: files in there instead of 20. it&#39;s

01:37:37.439 --> 01:37:42.238
Caption: really hard navigating a code editor

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.919
Caption: so while you&#39;re explaining perhaps a

01:37:42.238 --> 01:37:45.919
Caption: really technical concept remember the

01:37:43.919 --> 01:37:47.359
Caption: earlier someone is in their career

01:37:45.919 --> 01:37:49.359
Caption: just the harder they&#39;re going to

01:37:47.359 --> 01:37:51.520
Caption: struggle just because you know it&#39;s not

01:37:49.359 --> 01:37:53.759
Caption: muscle memory to use those shortcuts to

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:55.679
Caption: jump between files that that hasn&#39;t been

01:37:53.759 --> 01:37:56.879
Caption: developed yet depending on the level

01:37:55.679 --> 01:37:58.959
Caption: that they&#39;re at so while you&#39;re

01:37:56.879 --> 01:38:00.158
Caption: mentoring someone have compassion really

01:37:58.959 --> 01:38:01.759
Caption: think about where they are in their

01:38:00.159 --> 01:38:04.159
Caption: career and what they&#39;re good at and what

01:38:01.759 --> 01:38:05.839
Caption: they still need help with and adjust the

01:38:04.159 --> 01:38:08.479
Caption: language that you use and the pace that

01:38:05.839 --> 01:38:09.839
Caption: you go at to suit them

01:38:08.479 --> 01:38:11.439
Caption: i also want you to talk about your

01:38:09.839 --> 01:38:13.759
Caption: failures

01:38:11.439 --> 01:38:16.639
Caption: this is really important because it&#39;s

01:38:13.759 --> 01:38:17.759
Caption: really easy to feel like oh i messed up

01:38:16.639 --> 01:38:18.880
Caption: and i don&#39;t want to be judged so i&#39;m

01:38:17.759 --> 01:38:20.718
Caption: going to hide it i&#39;m not going to tell

01:38:18.879 --> 01:38:22.158
Caption: anyone no we don&#39;t want that that&#39;s how

01:38:20.719 --> 01:38:24.000
Caption: prod gets broken and everyone feels

01:38:22.159 --> 01:38:25.760
Caption: confused so i want you to talk about

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.560
Caption: your failures

01:38:25.759 --> 01:38:31.118
Caption: i broke prod a few weeks ago and i broke

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:32.639
Caption: it in a very bad way because we have

01:38:31.119 --> 01:38:34.159
Caption: this little toast that comes up from the

01:38:32.639 --> 01:38:35.840
Caption: corner and when you click it you go to a

01:38:34.159 --> 01:38:37.280
Caption: site that where people sign up and

01:38:35.839 --> 01:38:38.879
Caption: actually give us money so envaro

01:38:37.279 --> 01:38:40.879
Caption: actually makes money from it and i

01:38:38.879 --> 01:38:44.638
Caption: accidentally got rid of the toast and no

01:38:40.879 --> 01:38:45.759
Caption: one noticed and that was bad so instead

01:38:44.639 --> 01:38:47.199
Caption: of

01:38:45.759 --> 01:38:49.279
Caption: you know trying to bury that and think

01:38:47.199 --> 01:38:51.440
Caption: oh just fix this i went to the team like

01:38:49.279 --> 01:38:53.599
Caption: hey team i messed up la la la la la and

01:38:51.439 --> 01:38:55.759
Caption: so we fixed it right but then what was

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:57.760
Caption: important about that process is that i

01:38:55.759 --> 01:39:00.238
Caption: then went to the apprentices like oh

01:38:57.759 --> 01:39:02.238
Caption: here&#39;s what i did yesterday i really

01:39:00.238 --> 01:39:04.799
Caption: messed up and so we actually did our own

01:39:02.238 --> 01:39:06.079
Caption: little postmortem about oh what went

01:39:04.799 --> 01:39:07.678
Caption: wrong and how about we dig through the

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:09.040
Caption: code and figure out how that happened

01:39:07.679 --> 01:39:10.400
Caption: and let&#39;s talk about the process that we

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:12.399
Caption: went through to discover that this thing

01:39:10.399 --> 01:39:13.600
Caption: was actually an issue by the way when

01:39:12.399 --> 01:39:15.439
Caption: you&#39;re doing something like that check

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.919
Caption: that it actually works on prod because

01:39:15.439 --> 01:39:19.919
Caption: no one did and no one noticed so talk

01:39:17.919 --> 01:39:21.919
Caption: about your failures with them quite

01:39:19.919 --> 01:39:23.520
Caption: often they&#39;re going to ask you um

01:39:21.919 --> 01:39:24.879
Caption: probing questions that are going to make

01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:26.959
Caption: you realize yeah

01:39:24.879 --> 01:39:28.080
Caption: maybe we should adjust our process maybe

01:39:26.959 --> 01:39:29.359
Caption: i should have changed prod when i

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:30.719
Caption: deployed this thing rather than thinking

01:39:29.359 --> 01:39:33.919
Caption: prod and staging we&#39;re going to be the

01:39:30.719 --> 01:39:35.840
Caption: same state because that&#39;s ridiculous

01:39:33.919 --> 01:39:37.520
Caption: they&#39;re never the same state

01:39:35.839 --> 01:39:40.479
Caption: yeah there was it was a whole problem it

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:42.080
Caption: was a whole thing staging was

01:39:40.479 --> 01:39:43.600
Caption: this is the state that i was in that day

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.800
Caption: when i broke that thing it was not a fun

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.639
Caption: day

01:39:44.799 --> 01:39:47.919
Caption: i also want you to remember to provide

01:39:46.639 --> 01:39:49.360
Caption: meaningful work with meaningless

01:39:47.919 --> 01:39:51.520
Caption: deadlines

01:39:49.359 --> 01:39:53.118
Caption: and this is something that i think we do

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:55.919
Caption: really well at envato with our

01:39:53.119 --> 01:39:57.520
Caption: apprentices so we go we actually sit on

01:39:55.919 --> 01:39:58.799
Caption: delivery teams we send we spend about

01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.600
Caption: six weeks on a team and then we hop

01:39:58.799 --> 01:40:01.118
Caption: around

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:03.439
Caption: and while we&#39;re on those delivery teams

01:40:01.119 --> 01:40:05.600
Caption: our apprentices are given real cards

01:40:03.439 --> 01:40:07.198
Caption: that do contribute um to the product

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:08.800
Caption: that actually make a difference but

01:40:07.199 --> 01:40:10.560
Caption: they&#39;re given cards specifically that

01:40:08.799 --> 01:40:12.799
Caption: aren&#39;t urgent they have absolutely no

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:14.000
Caption: deadline attached in fact the earlier

01:40:12.799 --> 01:40:15.599
Caption: they are on in their apprenticeship the

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.080
Caption: more likely that in their first six

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:21.520
Caption: weeks they will not finish that card and

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:23.199
Caption: instead our goal is to go on tangents

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:24.639
Caption: learn a bunch of stuff in the process

01:40:23.199 --> 01:40:26.320
Caption: and make sure we do a really good

01:40:24.639 --> 01:40:27.199
Caption: handover with the team when we leave the

01:40:26.319 --> 01:40:29.040
Caption: team

01:40:27.199 --> 01:40:30.800
Caption: and what that ends up doing is it just

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:33.119
Caption: takes away the pressure

01:40:30.799 --> 01:40:34.559
Caption: there&#39;s no like ah i need to learn this

01:40:33.119 --> 01:40:35.760
Caption: thing but this thing&#39;s due next week so

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:37.199
Caption: hayley can you just tell us so we can

01:40:35.759 --> 01:40:39.279
Caption: feel like we&#39;re making progress it takes

01:40:37.199 --> 01:40:40.719
Caption: all that away but at the same time they

01:40:39.279 --> 01:40:42.079
Caption: get to feel like they&#39;re actually making

01:40:40.719 --> 01:40:44.960
Caption: a difference on the product that they&#39;re

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:47.280
Caption: working on so meaningful work meaning

01:40:44.959 --> 01:40:49.759
Caption: meaningless deadlines is probably if you

01:40:47.279 --> 01:40:51.839
Caption: take one thing away this is this should

01:40:49.759 --> 01:40:52.879
Caption: be it this makes a significant

01:40:51.839 --> 01:40:54.158
Caption: difference

01:40:52.879 --> 01:40:56.560
Caption: when you&#39;re onboarding someone new to

01:40:54.159 --> 01:40:57.840
Caption: your team

01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:00.399
Caption: and finally i&#39;d also like you to

01:40:57.839 --> 01:41:02.560
Caption: remember to leave your ego at the door

01:41:00.399 --> 01:41:04.718
Caption: just because you&#39;re a contributor to

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.080
Caption: django doesn&#39;t mean that you need to you

01:41:04.719 --> 01:41:07.520
Caption: know throw your weight around and say oh

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:09.359
Caption: but i wrote it so i know that it works

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:11.279
Caption: the space you need to do it this way

01:41:09.359 --> 01:41:12.238
Caption: like in a mentoring session totally not

01:41:11.279 --> 01:41:14.000
Caption: useful

01:41:12.238 --> 01:41:15.118
Caption: totally not encouraging totally not

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.119
Caption: friendly

01:41:15.119 --> 01:41:19.280
Caption: so leave your ego at the door it doesn&#39;t

01:41:17.119 --> 01:41:20.719
Caption: matter how much experience you have when

01:41:19.279 --> 01:41:22.479
Caption: you&#39;re mentoring someone you&#39;re focused

01:41:20.719 --> 01:41:23.920
Caption: on them you&#39;re not focused on your

01:41:22.479 --> 01:41:26.879
Caption: experience you&#39;re focused on them and

01:41:23.919 --> 01:41:27.919
Caption: what they need to learn

01:41:26.879 --> 01:41:29.600
Caption: so

01:41:27.919 --> 01:41:31.520
Caption: we&#39;ve talked about how mentoring can

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:32.639
Caption: help you to be a better dev we&#39;ve talked

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:34.639
Caption: about how it can help you to be an

01:41:32.639 --> 01:41:36.159
Caption: effective mentor and now i want us to

01:41:34.639 --> 01:41:38.000
Caption: talk about how can you actually use all

01:41:36.159 --> 01:41:40.080
Caption: these skills to make a difference in our

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.759
Caption: industry

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:43.520
Caption: so i would like to point out that only

01:41:41.759 --> 01:41:45.759
Caption: training those that are already in

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:47.679
Caption: engineering doesn&#39;t really help with our

01:41:45.759 --> 01:41:49.919
Caption: diversity issue

01:41:47.679 --> 01:41:51.280
Caption: like if you look around this room

01:41:49.919 --> 01:41:54.080
Caption: how many women in here and how many

01:41:51.279 --> 01:41:56.238
Caption: dudes are here like if you only train

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:58.479
Caption: the cohort of people in this room are we

01:41:56.238 --> 01:42:00.959
Caption: helping to produce more role models or

01:41:58.479 --> 01:42:02.080
Caption: improve the diversity in industry no we

01:42:00.959 --> 01:42:03.279
Caption: are doing a great thing because we&#39;re

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:05.199
Caption: helping each other and we&#39;re helping

01:42:03.279 --> 01:42:07.118
Caption: build our community to upskill and

01:42:05.199 --> 01:42:09.360
Caption: that&#39;s fantastic but you&#39;re not helping

01:42:07.119 --> 01:42:11.600
Caption: with diversity so i want you to use

01:42:09.359 --> 01:42:13.198
Caption: these skills to actually shift the

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:14.399
Caption: needle and gets more interesting and

01:42:13.199 --> 01:42:16.639
Caption: different

01:42:14.399 --> 01:42:18.158
Caption: teams built in our industry

01:42:16.639 --> 01:42:19.919
Caption: so i want you to consider taking on

01:42:18.159 --> 01:42:22.639
Caption: career changes

01:42:19.919 --> 01:42:24.639
Caption: for diversity of thought and experience

01:42:22.639 --> 01:42:27.040
Caption: and what i mean by this is

01:42:24.639 --> 01:42:28.959
Caption: so many places go to like a university

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:30.479
Caption: for their main recruitment drive if you

01:42:28.959 --> 01:42:33.119
Caption: look at the number of people who are in

01:42:30.479 --> 01:42:34.959
Caption: university or tafe or even boot camps

01:42:33.119 --> 01:42:36.800
Caption: they&#39;re they are predominantly men this

01:42:34.959 --> 01:42:39.198
Caption: is not a secret so if that is where

01:42:36.799 --> 01:42:41.040
Caption: you&#39;re primarily going to recruit then

01:42:39.199 --> 01:42:43.280
Caption: you are primarily attempting to recruit

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:44.719
Caption: men and you&#39;re leaving women behind so i

01:42:43.279 --> 01:42:46.079
Caption: want you to consider taking on career

01:42:44.719 --> 01:42:48.000
Caption: changes people who have taught

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:50.239
Caption: themselves at home and maybe done a few

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.279
Caption: workshops and they&#39;re feeling confident

01:42:50.238 --> 01:42:53.439
Caption: and they&#39;re feeling like they&#39;re ready

01:42:51.279 --> 01:42:54.879
Caption: to learn and you might think oh but do

01:42:53.439 --> 01:42:56.399
Caption: they have the experience they haven&#39;t

01:42:54.879 --> 01:42:58.238
Caption: done this training if someone is

01:42:56.399 --> 01:43:00.319
Caption: prepared to change careers i can

01:42:58.238 --> 01:43:01.839
Caption: guarantee you they are prepared to learn

01:43:00.319 --> 01:43:03.678
Caption: and they are going to be dedicated they

01:43:01.839 --> 01:43:05.919
Caption: will be a great person to hire and train

01:43:03.679 --> 01:43:07.760
Caption: yourself

01:43:05.919 --> 01:43:10.080
Caption: i&#39;d also like you to consider upskilling

01:43:07.759 --> 01:43:11.519
Caption: those that agenda diverse to create more

01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:13.359
Caption: role models

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:15.919
Caption: and how might you do that

01:43:13.359 --> 01:43:18.479
Caption: so at envato we like to say our

01:43:15.919 --> 01:43:19.359
Caption: apprentice program isn&#39;t equal but it is

01:43:18.479 --> 01:43:21.199
Caption: fair

01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:23.198
Caption: and we say that because our apprentice

01:43:21.199 --> 01:43:24.479
Caption: program actually only takes on

01:43:23.199 --> 01:43:27.360
Caption: people who

01:43:24.479 --> 01:43:29.199
Caption: identify as women we do not take cis men

01:43:27.359 --> 01:43:31.198
Caption: into the apprentice program

01:43:29.199 --> 01:43:33.040
Caption: and at first thought and i bet someone

01:43:31.199 --> 01:43:34.080
Caption: in here is really outraged about that

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:37.520
Caption: right now

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:39.359
Caption: so yes you are right it is not equal but

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:41.439
Caption: quite often someone says well that&#39;s not

01:43:39.359 --> 01:43:43.919
Caption: fair and what i would like to point out

01:43:41.439 --> 01:43:46.319
Caption: to you is that if you go to university

01:43:43.919 --> 01:43:48.560
Caption: or tafe or a boot camp you&#39;ll see plenty

01:43:46.319 --> 01:43:50.638
Caption: of men and you&#39;ll see hardly any woman

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:52.560
Caption: men have every opportunity to get into

01:43:50.639 --> 01:43:54.239
Caption: this industry it is much harder to be a

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:56.080
Caption: woman in this industry

01:43:54.238 --> 01:43:57.759
Caption: it is much much harder to break into

01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:59.119
Caption: this industry it is much harder to get

01:43:57.759 --> 01:44:00.559
Caption: over your imposter syndrome in this

01:43:59.119 --> 01:44:02.800
Caption: industry it is much harder to find a

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:04.479
Caption: role model in this industry and if you

01:44:02.799 --> 01:44:07.359
Caption: would like to argue with me on that

01:44:04.479 --> 01:44:08.959
Caption: later i i&#39;m more than happy to because

01:44:07.359 --> 01:44:11.279
Caption: this rant can go on a lot longer than

01:44:08.959 --> 01:44:13.600
Caption: this one slide so i would like you to

01:44:11.279 --> 01:44:16.000
Caption: consider when you go and hire someone

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:17.919
Caption: who&#39;s new to this industry

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.359
Caption: could you be more diverse in your hiring

01:44:17.919 --> 01:44:21.439
Caption: practices

01:44:19.359 --> 01:44:23.839
Caption: could you maybe remove names from cvs

01:44:21.439 --> 01:44:26.479
Caption: for example and just take out

01:44:23.839 --> 01:44:27.919
Caption: you know the burden of oh i&#39;ve seen

01:44:26.479 --> 01:44:29.119
Caption: their name so i know this person&#39;s a

01:44:27.919 --> 01:44:31.279
Caption: woman i know this person&#39;s a man and

01:44:29.119 --> 01:44:32.639
Caption: just higher on you know the experience

01:44:31.279 --> 01:44:35.039
Caption: and what they bring to the team and how

01:44:32.639 --> 01:44:36.560
Caption: willing they are to learn

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:38.399
Caption: rather than

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:39.760
Caption: going to your universities and going to

01:44:38.399 --> 01:44:41.040
Caption: your tafes and going to your boot camps

01:44:39.759 --> 01:44:41.919
Caption: unless it&#39;s she codes because that&#39;s for

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:43.600
Caption: women

01:44:41.919 --> 01:44:44.879
Caption: because then you&#39;re already you&#39;ve got a

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:47.040
Caption: problem and you&#39;re hiring a pipeline

01:44:44.879 --> 01:44:48.638
Caption: already

01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.239
Caption: and quickly i&#39;d also like us to run

01:44:48.639 --> 01:44:52.479
Caption: through just what are the other benefits

Caption: hear me um welcome welcome thank you for

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:46.719
Caption: coming to my talk lessons from the video

01:58:44.319 --> 01:58:49.359
Caption: game industry i am jamie butler the

01:58:46.719 --> 01:58:51.679
Caption: consultant at purple as you just heard

01:58:49.359 --> 01:58:53.598
Caption: what does that mean it means i&#39;m quite a

01:58:51.679 --> 01:58:55.920
Caption: generalist so consulting i&#39;m on

01:58:53.599 --> 01:58:57.919
Caption: different gigs every three six months

01:58:55.919 --> 01:59:00.000
Caption: and that&#39;s different tech stacks that&#39;s

01:58:57.919 --> 01:59:01.759
Caption: different corporate environments that&#39;s

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.599
Caption: different this that and the other thing

01:59:01.759 --> 01:59:05.598
Caption: and within that space i do all sorts as

01:59:03.599 --> 01:59:07.679
Caption: well do agile

01:59:05.599 --> 01:59:09.360
Caption: coaching discovering

01:59:07.679 --> 01:59:10.479
Caption: requirements building the actual

01:59:09.359 --> 01:59:12.638
Caption: software

01:59:10.479 --> 01:59:13.759
Caption: testing deploying ops just a little bit

01:59:12.639 --> 01:59:15.439
Caption: of everything so the point that i&#39;m

01:59:13.759 --> 01:59:18.638
Caption: making there is

01:59:15.439 --> 01:59:21.599
Caption: i&#39;m a generalist but i also love video

01:59:18.639 --> 01:59:24.320
Caption: games uh and so i wanted to talk to you

01:59:21.599 --> 01:59:27.520
Caption: about gdc the game developer conference

01:59:24.319 --> 01:59:29.520
Caption: housed in san francisco yearly

01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:32.000
Caption: and i think i hit on this one because i

01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:34.479
Caption: love video games and two because i&#39;m

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.119
Caption: such a generalist and there is just

01:59:34.479 --> 01:59:39.839
Caption: so much going on with these conferences

01:59:37.119 --> 01:59:41.760
Caption: uh people are delivering lessons on

01:59:39.839 --> 01:59:43.359
Caption: leadership they&#39;re delivering lessons on

01:59:41.759 --> 01:59:46.479
Caption: building a business from scratch they&#39;re

01:59:43.359 --> 01:59:48.560
Caption: develop delivering lessons on cool

01:59:46.479 --> 01:59:50.000
Caption: ux development techniques and software

01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:51.280
Caption: development techniques so there&#39;s a

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.279
Caption: little bit of something there for

01:59:51.279 --> 01:59:56.079
Caption: everybody and for a general

01:59:53.279 --> 01:59:57.598
Caption: generalist like me there&#39;s tons for me

01:59:56.080 --> 02:00:00.159
Caption: to consume

01:59:57.599 --> 02:00:03.199
Caption: so the goal here is really just to

02:00:00.159 --> 02:00:05.520
Caption: illuminate you to the

02:00:03.199 --> 02:00:07.199
Caption: high high value of this resource get you

02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:09.279
Caption: consuming it and the way i&#39;m going to do

02:00:07.199 --> 02:00:11.520
Caption: that is just share with you a handful of

02:00:09.279 --> 02:00:15.118
Caption: lessons that i personally learnt just

02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:16.319
Caption: from watching these gdc conference talks

02:00:15.119 --> 02:00:17.679
Caption: and yeah

02:00:16.319 --> 02:00:20.479
Caption: see what we discover

02:00:17.679 --> 02:00:22.639
Caption: so first off we have

02:00:20.479 --> 02:00:24.639
Caption: cursed problems

02:00:22.639 --> 02:00:26.719
Caption: the idea of a cursed problem

02:00:24.639 --> 02:00:29.119
Caption: is something that alex jeff from riot

02:00:26.719 --> 02:00:31.440
Caption: games kind of put together over the last

02:00:29.119 --> 02:00:34.000
Caption: few years and he gave a talk about it uh

02:00:31.439 --> 02:00:35.678
Caption: it&#39;s the idea of your in a product

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.359
Caption: development setting or he thinks of it

02:00:35.679 --> 02:00:39.119
Caption: as a game development setting but really

02:00:37.359 --> 02:00:40.560
Caption: it&#39;s a product development setting where

02:00:39.119 --> 02:00:42.479
Caption: you&#39;ve hit a design problem you

02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:45.280
Caption: literally can&#39;t solve and what you

02:00:42.479 --> 02:00:47.439
Caption: really need to do is identify that it is

02:00:45.279 --> 02:00:50.319
Caption: an unsolvable problem as early as you

02:00:47.439 --> 02:00:52.718
Caption: possibly can so you don&#39;t drag your team

02:00:50.319 --> 02:00:54.399
Caption: of 10 1500

02:00:52.719 --> 02:00:55.280
Caption: people in your company along for the

02:00:54.399 --> 02:00:56.158
Caption: ride

02:00:55.279 --> 02:00:58.879
Caption: um

02:00:56.159 --> 02:01:02.800
Caption: so curse problem as he puts it

02:00:58.879 --> 02:01:05.198
Caption: is a core conflict between the promises

02:01:02.799 --> 02:01:08.238
Caption: of your product and it&#39;s imp important

02:01:05.199 --> 02:01:10.239
Caption: to note here that the promises might be

02:01:08.238 --> 02:01:11.839
Caption: intended or explicit like this is what i

02:01:10.238 --> 02:01:15.118
Caption: built my product to do that&#39;s the point

02:01:11.839 --> 02:01:17.598
Caption: of it or they might be derived by your

02:01:15.119 --> 02:01:19.599
Caption: users your users might get your hand

02:01:17.599 --> 02:01:21.840
Caption: their hands on your product and go ah

02:01:19.599 --> 02:01:24.000
Caption: this is what this product is for not

02:01:21.839 --> 02:01:26.080
Caption: actually what you intended for it to be

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.238
Caption: and if those that come into conflict

02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:30.000
Caption: with each other um then you cannot

02:01:28.238 --> 02:01:32.319
Caption: proceed with the design that you&#39;ve got

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:34.238
Caption: you need to pretty fundamentally change

02:01:32.319 --> 02:01:35.678
Caption: the design

02:01:34.238 --> 02:01:37.118
Caption: and while i won&#39;t go into it alex

02:01:35.679 --> 02:01:39.760
Caption: provides a whole bunch of techniques for

02:01:37.119 --> 02:01:41.360
Caption: identifying these curse problems and for

02:01:39.759 --> 02:01:43.039
Caption: offering ways to you know make those

02:01:41.359 --> 02:01:45.439
Caption: fundamental shifts that you need to make

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:46.959
Caption: if you end up in that situation

02:01:45.439 --> 02:01:48.959
Caption: and the example of a curse problem that

02:01:46.959 --> 02:01:50.560
Caption: he gives i give several but the one that

02:01:48.959 --> 02:01:52.639
Caption: i really liked is you can see tucked

02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:55.040
Caption: away there

02:01:52.639 --> 02:01:58.959
Caption: if you&#39;re familiar with diablo 3 at all

02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:01.599
Caption: the diablo 3 auction house so diablo 3

02:01:58.959 --> 02:02:03.439
Caption: is a luda game you

02:02:01.599 --> 02:02:05.199
Caption: use cool spells or swinging axe and kill

02:02:03.439 --> 02:02:06.879
Caption: a whole bunch of enemies and

02:02:05.199 --> 02:02:08.479
Caption: you get cool loot and every time you do

02:02:06.879 --> 02:02:10.000
Caption: you&#39;re like what did i just get you know

02:02:08.479 --> 02:02:12.159
Caption: is it better than what i have before is

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.359
Caption: it really awesome legendary is it

02:02:12.159 --> 02:02:17.599
Caption: amazing and they added this idea of an

02:02:15.359 --> 02:02:20.080
Caption: auction house where you can

02:02:17.599 --> 02:02:22.239
Caption: sell the loot that you&#39;ve got and buy

02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:23.839
Caption: loot that you really want and

02:02:22.238 --> 02:02:25.839
Caption: what happens there is you get this

02:02:23.839 --> 02:02:27.439
Caption: conflict of the whole kind of core

02:02:25.839 --> 02:02:29.520
Caption: premise of your game

02:02:27.439 --> 02:02:30.879
Caption: in one aspect it&#39;s a looter and you

02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:32.239
Caption: should be looking forward to that moment

02:02:30.879 --> 02:02:34.158
Caption: of finding the cool thing that you

02:02:32.238 --> 02:02:36.479
Caption: really want be able to add an auction

02:02:34.159 --> 02:02:38.639
Caption: house suddenly it&#39;s just everything that

02:02:36.479 --> 02:02:40.560
Caption: i get is just something i&#39;m going to

02:02:38.639 --> 02:02:41.520
Caption: sell so i can save up and buy the thing

02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:43.119
Caption: i really want and those are

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:45.919
Caption: fundamentally

02:02:43.119 --> 02:02:48.239
Caption: contradictory experiences and the

02:02:45.919 --> 02:02:49.678
Caption: solution for diablo iii once they

02:02:48.238 --> 02:02:51.359
Caption: realized that they were in this position

02:02:49.679 --> 02:02:52.719
Caption: was to just kill it they got rid of the

02:02:51.359 --> 02:02:55.118
Caption: auction house because they what they

02:02:52.719 --> 02:02:57.040
Caption: wanted to keep was that core looter

02:02:55.119 --> 02:02:58.000
Caption: experience

02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:59.839
Caption: and

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.359
Caption: my example when i think and try and

02:02:59.839 --> 02:03:03.279
Caption: translate it more to what i do in

02:03:01.359 --> 02:03:05.040
Caption: product development i had to think about

02:03:03.279 --> 02:03:07.359
Caption: um tumblr so

02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:09.199
Caption: tumblr was originally built as like a

02:03:07.359 --> 02:03:11.040
Caption: blogging platform a really simple

02:03:09.199 --> 02:03:12.719
Caption: blogging blogging platform sign in with

02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:14.959
Caption: an email suddenly you&#39;ve got a blogging

02:03:12.719 --> 02:03:17.679
Caption: platform it&#39;s really easy to use

02:03:14.959 --> 02:03:19.520
Caption: but what the implied promise seem to be

02:03:17.679 --> 02:03:21.840
Caption: from the user&#39;s perspective is a cool

02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:24.879
Caption: debating platform where they can debate

02:03:21.839 --> 02:03:27.118
Caption: the fundamentals of society and

02:03:24.879 --> 02:03:29.279
Caption: those two things are not the same one is

02:03:27.119 --> 02:03:30.800
Caption: all about broadcasting your opinions and

02:03:29.279 --> 02:03:33.678
Caption: one is about having a healthy back and

02:03:30.799 --> 02:03:36.079
Caption: forth with somebody else and or in an

02:03:33.679 --> 02:03:38.479
Caption: open forum and the way that tumblr dealt

02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:39.760
Caption: with that was just kind of go oh well

02:03:38.479 --> 02:03:41.759
Caption: this is really taking off we&#39;re going to

02:03:39.759 --> 02:03:43.678
Caption: focus on this we&#39;re going to focus on

02:03:41.759 --> 02:03:46.479
Caption: this back and forth and chaining blog

02:03:43.679 --> 02:03:49.199
Caption: posts onto each other to create kind of

02:03:46.479 --> 02:03:51.040
Caption: a chained argument not like just a

02:03:49.199 --> 02:03:52.639
Caption: blogging platform

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:54.719
Caption: so there are multiple different ways to

02:03:52.639 --> 02:03:57.599
Caption: solve a curse problem but that&#39;s the way

02:03:54.719 --> 02:04:00.000
Caption: the tumblr uh took

02:03:57.599 --> 02:04:03.439
Caption: so next so that that&#39;s kind of a bit of

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.959
Caption: a design lesson that we can learn um

02:04:03.439 --> 02:04:08.000
Caption: moving over a little bit to the tech

02:04:04.959 --> 02:04:10.080
Caption: side uh we have uh we went from curses

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.879
Caption: to cursing with weather

02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:15.520
Caption: are your tests by kevin dill of kythera

02:04:12.879 --> 02:04:18.080
Caption: ai uh this guy works on

02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:20.799
Caption: traversal program uh traversal ai so

02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:23.119
Caption: bots moving around a world like think

02:04:20.799 --> 02:04:26.718
Caption: cyberpunk 2077 and all the people moving

02:04:23.119 --> 02:04:28.880
Caption: around in it um and this talk was pretty

02:04:26.719 --> 02:04:31.599
Caption: much just a straight up evangelizing of

02:04:28.879 --> 02:04:33.040
Caption: unit test uh mentality and testing

02:04:31.599 --> 02:04:34.479
Caption: mentality which apparently the game

02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:36.159
Caption: industry is not very mature in they

02:04:34.479 --> 02:04:38.319
Caption: don&#39;t you know feel the need to write

02:04:36.159 --> 02:04:39.840
Caption: automated tests all the time so it&#39;s

02:04:38.319 --> 02:04:42.319
Caption: pretty straightforward in that regard

02:04:39.839 --> 02:04:44.158
Caption: but the nugget lesson that i pulled out

02:04:42.319 --> 02:04:46.158
Caption: of this one was

02:04:44.159 --> 02:04:48.080
Caption: when kevin started talking about tests

02:04:46.159 --> 02:04:50.800
Caption: that they have to write that are just

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:53.839
Caption: going to take like 30 seconds or 45

02:04:50.799 --> 02:04:55.439
Caption: seconds to run um and those are kind of

02:04:53.839 --> 02:04:57.919
Caption: annoying right they bloat your test

02:04:55.439 --> 02:04:58.879
Caption: suites runtime horrifically especially

02:04:57.919 --> 02:05:00.080
Caption: you know if you&#39;re going to write one

02:04:58.879 --> 02:05:02.799
Caption: test really what you&#39;re going to do is

02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:04.239
Caption: write like a permutation of that test

02:05:02.799 --> 02:05:07.520
Caption: seven or eight different versions of

02:05:04.238 --> 02:05:10.479
Caption: that test and suddenly just in one set

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:13.359
Caption: of tests you&#39;ve got a four minute test

02:05:10.479 --> 02:05:15.199
Caption: suite running and that&#39;s kind of yuck

02:05:13.359 --> 02:05:17.839
Caption: so the nugget that i got from him is to

02:05:15.199 --> 02:05:20.880
Caption: just tag those and many different

02:05:17.839 --> 02:05:22.399
Caption: testing libraries like jest and

02:05:20.879 --> 02:05:24.319
Caption: n-unit and c-sharp and what have you

02:05:22.399 --> 02:05:26.718
Caption: will let you tag your tests and just

02:05:24.319 --> 02:05:27.839
Caption: only run those slow tests overnight

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:29.760
Caption: don&#39;t run them when you&#39;re doing your

02:05:27.839 --> 02:05:32.879
Caption: regular building when you&#39;re doing your

02:05:29.759 --> 02:05:35.439
Caption: mergers into master or what have you

02:05:32.879 --> 02:05:36.959
Caption: run them overnight or just before uh

02:05:35.439 --> 02:05:38.399
Caption: deployment to production whichever comes

02:05:36.959 --> 02:05:40.000
Caption: first

02:05:38.399 --> 02:05:42.238
Caption: and that way you will come in the

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.759
Caption: morning all that really slow testing is

02:05:42.238 --> 02:05:45.678
Caption: done you can spot a problem if it&#39;s

02:05:43.759 --> 02:05:48.319
Caption: there and deal with it and you get the

02:05:45.679 --> 02:05:49.920
Caption: value of those slow tests which might be

02:05:48.319 --> 02:05:51.118
Caption: they might need to be slow because

02:05:49.919 --> 02:05:53.279
Caption: you&#39;re testing something that should

02:05:51.119 --> 02:05:55.119
Caption: take a long time or they might just be

02:05:53.279 --> 02:05:57.279
Caption: slow because you know it&#39;s a really

02:05:55.119 --> 02:05:59.599
Caption: meaty process that you&#39;re testing but

02:05:57.279 --> 02:06:02.479
Caption: yeah a little uh tech a bit of wisdom

02:05:59.599 --> 02:06:05.040
Caption: that i got from that

02:06:02.479 --> 02:06:06.799
Caption: next up we have something more along the

02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:07.919
Caption: design lines so

02:06:06.799 --> 02:06:09.040
Caption: this is going to be a common theme

02:06:07.919 --> 02:06:10.479
Caption: you&#39;re going to keep hearing me say

02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:11.839
Caption: there are lessons coming from every

02:06:10.479 --> 02:06:13.919
Caption: discipline

02:06:11.839 --> 02:06:15.919
Caption: in gdc

02:06:13.919 --> 02:06:17.919
Caption: and this one was critiquing game visuals

02:06:15.919 --> 02:06:20.959
Caption: common problems and how to solve them by

02:06:17.919 --> 02:06:24.000
Caption: ali overton of spryfox

02:06:20.959 --> 02:06:26.718
Caption: and the core of the talk was just

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.319
Caption: figuring out how you can critique

02:06:26.719 --> 02:06:30.000
Caption: a visual design figure out what needs to

02:06:28.319 --> 02:06:31.598
Caption: be improved about it and then make those

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.839
Caption: improvements

02:06:31.599 --> 02:06:38.239
Caption: but i loved this talk because i tell you

02:06:33.839 --> 02:06:40.638
Caption: what i&#39;m so bad at this it&#39;s unreal

02:06:38.238 --> 02:06:42.399
Caption: any time i work on a piece of software

02:06:40.639 --> 02:06:44.719
Caption: myself and there isn&#39;t a designer

02:06:42.399 --> 02:06:46.879
Caption: involved somebody&#39;s poor eyes will

02:06:44.719 --> 02:06:49.119
Caption: probably bleed and

02:06:46.879 --> 02:06:50.799
Caption: i have tried to solve this for myself

02:06:49.119 --> 02:06:52.639
Caption: many times i&#39;ve just like gone to blog

02:06:50.799 --> 02:06:54.238
Caption: posts and i&#39;ve gone to

02:06:52.639 --> 02:06:56.479
Caption: you know learning material to figure out

02:06:54.238 --> 02:06:58.718
Caption: color theory i&#39;ve studied color theory

02:06:56.479 --> 02:07:01.279
Caption: got color theory down it still makes

02:06:58.719 --> 02:07:05.840
Caption: people&#39;s eyes bleed what&#39;s going on and

02:07:01.279 --> 02:07:07.118
Caption: this video finally got through to me and

02:07:05.839 --> 02:07:08.799
Caption: i&#39;m sure it would be different for

02:07:07.119 --> 02:07:11.119
Caption: everybody but for me it was just like

02:07:08.799 --> 02:07:12.959
Caption: the i just wasn&#39;t taking saturation into

02:07:11.119 --> 02:07:14.719
Caption: consideration i didn&#39;t even really

02:07:12.959 --> 02:07:17.279
Caption: understand what saturation was trying it

02:07:14.719 --> 02:07:19.520
Caption: was getting at um and everything i ever

02:07:17.279 --> 02:07:21.598
Caption: designed was just like full saturation

02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:23.679
Caption: all the time and that&#39;s why the eyes

02:07:21.599 --> 02:07:26.079
Caption: were bleeding and now i know

02:07:23.679 --> 02:07:28.239
Caption: um so very happy for that i mean you&#39;ve

02:07:26.079 --> 02:07:30.320
Caption: got an example here of um one of the

02:07:28.238 --> 02:07:32.238
Caption: little bits that she took us through

02:07:30.319 --> 02:07:35.118
Caption: and you can just see that the one on the

02:07:32.238 --> 02:07:37.598
Caption: left is um really like pretty evenly

02:07:35.119 --> 02:07:39.360
Caption: desaturated and you have to work hard to

02:07:37.599 --> 02:07:41.280
Caption: decide what&#39;s important in that image

02:07:39.359 --> 02:07:42.399
Caption: but the one on the right there&#39;s a bit

02:07:41.279 --> 02:07:45.039
Caption: more

02:07:42.399 --> 02:07:46.479
Caption: value contrast and saturation contrast

02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:48.719
Caption: and you can see that the little man with

02:07:46.479 --> 02:07:49.919
Caption: the sword is important maybe the tree is

02:07:48.719 --> 02:07:51.520
Caption: important

02:07:49.919 --> 02:07:54.639
Caption: but lots of little lessons like that

02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:58.000
Caption: stacked in there

02:07:54.639 --> 02:08:00.560
Caption: and now we come to war of a bit of a

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:02.399
Caption: leadership bit of a cultivating culture

02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:04.319
Caption: a new business

02:08:02.399 --> 02:08:06.079
Caption: kind of lesson so this one was from

02:08:04.319 --> 02:08:08.879
Caption: victoria tran of inner sloth the guys

02:08:06.079 --> 02:08:10.639
Caption: that make among us the talk was called

02:08:08.879 --> 02:08:15.359
Caption: charming communities

02:08:10.639 --> 02:08:17.679
Caption: and she took us through a whole bunch of

02:08:15.359 --> 02:08:19.839
Caption: lessons on how to create a really

02:08:17.679 --> 02:08:21.679
Caption: positive culture and she was always

02:08:19.839 --> 02:08:24.000
Caption: framing it in

02:08:21.679 --> 02:08:27.119
Caption: terms of the community that is playing

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:29.359
Caption: her game and interacting on socials and

02:08:27.119 --> 02:08:30.959
Caption: interacting with each other in the game

02:08:29.359 --> 02:08:32.319
Caption: but every single lesson that she went

02:08:30.959 --> 02:08:34.000
Caption: through i was

02:08:32.319 --> 02:08:35.520
Caption: realizing could be applied equally well

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.199
Caption: to building the culture within your

02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:39.919
Caption: company or within your team if you&#39;re

02:08:37.199 --> 02:08:41.599
Caption: just like a lead developer in a team you

02:08:39.919 --> 02:08:43.119
Caption: can use these skills to make sure that

02:08:41.599 --> 02:08:46.399
Caption: your team is happy and healthy and

02:08:43.119 --> 02:08:48.159
Caption: functional engaged if you&#39;re a ceo you

02:08:46.399 --> 02:08:48.959
Caption: can be exercising these techniques as

02:08:48.159 --> 02:08:49.760
Caption: well

02:08:48.959 --> 02:08:52.639
Caption: um

02:08:49.759 --> 02:08:54.959
Caption: pretty sure she got a lot of this stuff

02:08:52.639 --> 02:08:56.800
Caption: from a book called uh the power of

02:08:54.959 --> 02:08:58.159
Caption: moments which if you&#39;ve heard of it is

02:08:56.799 --> 02:08:59.759
Caption: it worth a read

02:08:58.159 --> 02:09:01.360
Caption: but the the

02:08:59.759 --> 02:09:03.839
Caption: key things i&#39;ll just quickly mention

02:09:01.359 --> 02:09:06.238
Caption: that she talked about were um having

02:09:03.839 --> 02:09:07.839
Caption: moments of surprise and levity so if you

02:09:06.238 --> 02:09:10.000
Caption: could you know always having to deliver

02:09:07.839 --> 02:09:11.839
Caption: the same kind of dry email once a week

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.879
Caption: of like oh here&#39;s what&#39;s changed in our

02:09:11.839 --> 02:09:16.879
Caption: apple um release notes what have you um

02:09:14.879 --> 02:09:18.158
Caption: insert jokes insert little moments that

02:09:16.879 --> 02:09:19.118
Caption: people can relate to and have a good

02:09:18.159 --> 02:09:21.119
Caption: time with

02:09:19.119 --> 02:09:23.199
Caption: um especially the more unexpected the

02:09:21.119 --> 02:09:26.560
Caption: better the more it will catch people and

02:09:23.199 --> 02:09:28.880
Caption: go ah that was interesting um

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:30.959
Caption: moments of connectivity and

02:09:28.879 --> 02:09:34.399
Caption: empathy so

02:09:30.959 --> 02:09:36.079
Caption: best example that i really enjoyed was

02:09:34.399 --> 02:09:38.399
Caption: paying attention if somebody&#39;s mentioned

02:09:36.079 --> 02:09:39.599
Caption: something that&#39;s going on in their life

02:09:38.399 --> 02:09:41.119
Caption: or something they&#39;re really really

02:09:39.599 --> 02:09:42.399
Caption: passionate about

02:09:41.119 --> 02:09:44.000
Caption: and you come across them or you&#39;re

02:09:42.399 --> 02:09:45.678
Caption: chatting to them two weeks later

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:48.238
Caption: completely without provocation just

02:09:45.679 --> 02:09:50.800
Caption: bring it up shows that you&#39;re listening

02:09:48.238 --> 02:09:53.118
Caption: that you care that you think about that

02:09:50.799 --> 02:09:54.638
Caption: person um and they&#39;ll feel connected to

02:09:53.119 --> 02:09:57.439
Caption: you and that will breed this really

02:09:54.639 --> 02:10:00.400
Caption: positive warm relationship

02:09:57.439 --> 02:10:01.359
Caption: a bit of just rapport building really

02:10:00.399 --> 02:10:03.359
Caption: and

02:10:01.359 --> 02:10:05.040
Caption: uh yeah there&#39;s one that i&#39;ve forgotten

02:10:03.359 --> 02:10:07.520
Caption: and i don&#39;t want to refer to my notes so

02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:08.959
Caption: we&#39;ll move on

02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:11.199
Caption: um

02:10:08.959 --> 02:10:14.319
Caption: next up we have isabel mccart david

02:10:11.199 --> 02:10:17.599
Caption: richard of behaviour interactive

02:10:14.319 --> 02:10:19.040
Caption: i wanted to include this one because

02:10:17.599 --> 02:10:20.560
Caption: there&#39;s

02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:22.079
Caption: at least from my perspective as a

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:24.159
Caption: developer

02:10:22.079 --> 02:10:25.919
Caption: i don&#39;t like to think too much about the

02:10:24.159 --> 02:10:28.560
Caption: money or the

02:10:25.919 --> 02:10:30.639
Caption: the financial strategy of things but you

02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:33.439
Caption: can learn those lessons if you go and

02:10:30.639 --> 02:10:35.919
Caption: have a look at gdc so isabel mccart and

02:10:33.439 --> 02:10:38.238
Caption: david richard were the

02:10:35.919 --> 02:10:40.879
Caption: cfo and the

02:10:38.238 --> 02:10:42.799
Caption: head designer or director

02:10:40.879 --> 02:10:45.439
Caption: from behavior interactive

02:10:42.799 --> 02:10:47.919
Caption: and these guys are responsible for dead

02:10:45.439 --> 02:10:50.399
Caption: by daylight which is uh online

02:10:47.919 --> 02:10:52.560
Caption: multiplayer game it&#39;s free one charac

02:10:50.399 --> 02:10:54.238
Caption: one person plays a monster and another

02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:56.399
Caption: handful of people play survivors it&#39;s a

02:10:54.238 --> 02:10:57.759
Caption: a

02:10:56.399 --> 02:10:59.678
Caption: asymmetrical

02:10:57.759 --> 02:11:01.678
Caption: competitive game

02:10:59.679 --> 02:11:03.679
Caption: but it&#39;s run with macro transactions

02:11:01.679 --> 02:11:06.639
Caption: that&#39;s their profit model is monetizing

02:11:03.679 --> 02:11:09.440
Caption: through buying skins and stuff like that

02:11:06.639 --> 02:11:11.520
Caption: the talk is all about

02:11:09.439 --> 02:11:14.639
Caption: respecting your users

02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:16.879
Caption: being really careful to not exploit them

02:11:14.639 --> 02:11:18.880
Caption: um trying to run that business model

02:11:16.879 --> 02:11:20.959
Caption: which is really kind of in a lot of ways

02:11:18.879 --> 02:11:22.319
Caption: unpopular there&#39;s a lot of assumptions

02:11:20.959 --> 02:11:24.560
Caption: baked into it that you&#39;re just kind of

02:11:22.319 --> 02:11:26.399
Caption: gonna get a crap product unless you

02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:28.079
Caption: chill out all the time

02:11:26.399 --> 02:11:29.040
Caption: doing that in a really respectful way

02:11:28.079 --> 02:11:30.399
Caption: and they come up with a lot of

02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:32.719
Caption: techniques

02:11:30.399 --> 02:11:35.759
Caption: a lot of core kind of vision statements

02:11:32.719 --> 02:11:38.400
Caption: about for example um

02:11:35.759 --> 02:11:41.118
Caption: the the core product all by itself needs

02:11:38.399 --> 02:11:42.560
Caption: to be completely playable enjoyable on

02:11:41.119 --> 02:11:44.079
Caption: its own

02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:47.280
Caption: things that cost money should really

02:11:44.079 --> 02:11:48.560
Caption: only add kind of aesthetic value or vibe

02:11:47.279 --> 02:11:50.399
Caption: shouldn&#39;t really change the core

02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:52.399
Caption: mechanics of your product and i feel

02:11:50.399 --> 02:11:55.040
Caption: like that&#39;s very applicable to

02:11:52.399 --> 02:11:56.718
Caption: um you know just software as a service

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:58.399
Caption: products that we sell maybe we&#39;re

02:11:56.719 --> 02:12:00.639
Caption: providing advertising or what have you

02:11:58.399 --> 02:12:03.040
Caption: but just to do it in a respectful way

02:12:00.639 --> 02:12:04.880
Caption: but the key quote that um dave richard

02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:06.239
Caption: came out with that i latched on to and

02:12:04.879 --> 02:12:08.879
Caption: the lesson that i really took from this

02:12:06.238 --> 02:12:10.959
Caption: mostly was a respectful monetization

02:12:08.879 --> 02:12:12.879
Caption: design helps to get buy-in from our dev

02:12:10.959 --> 02:12:15.040
Caption: team and when i heard that

02:12:12.879 --> 02:12:17.359
Caption: what i really heard was

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:19.599
Caption: running an ethical respectful business

02:12:17.359 --> 02:12:21.439
Caption: gets team members on board and giving it

02:14:39.439 --> 02:14:43.839

Caption: really trying to to convince you of the

02:29:52.799 --> 02:29:56.559
Caption: validity of this statement okay but

02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:58.000
Caption: after we&#39;ve done that we&#39;ll have a look

02:29:56.559 --> 02:29:59.358

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:01.519
Caption: don&#39;t have the answer to but i think you

02:29:59.359 --> 02:30:03.280

02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:08.080
Caption: and so are you

02:30:05.599 --> 02:30:10.639
Caption: let&#39;s go on

02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:13.120
Caption: this all started many years ago when i

02:30:10.639 --> 02:30:16.159
Caption: was doing a phd in ai and i was trying

02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:18.639
Caption: to make computers work more like humans

02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:20.799
Caption: be more able to match the world and and

02:30:18.639 --> 02:30:22.398
Caption: work in a fuzzy world in a wishing world

02:30:20.799 --> 02:30:24.799
Caption: but after doing my phd for a number of

02:30:22.399 --> 02:30:26.959
Caption: years i realized really it wasn&#39;t about

02:30:24.799 --> 02:30:29.120
Caption: that it came back to me thinking that

02:30:26.959 --> 02:30:30.478
Caption: computers are actually more like oh

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:32.479
Caption: sorry the brain is more actually more

02:30:30.478 --> 02:30:34.000
Caption: like computers and this really shocked

02:30:32.478 --> 02:30:35.599
Caption: me i&#39;ve gone a total flip of what i&#39;m

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.439
Caption: doing that&#39;s what i want to try and

02:30:35.599 --> 02:30:39.759
Caption: explain to you today

02:30:37.439 --> 02:30:41.920
Caption: but just to be clear up front when i say

02:30:39.759 --> 02:30:44.160
Caption: a brain is more like a computer i i

02:30:41.919 --> 02:30:45.599
Caption: don&#39;t mean a von neumann type

02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:47.280
Caption: architecture void norman type

02:30:45.599 --> 02:30:49.279

02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:50.399
Caption: course we&#39;re not like that

02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:52.240
Caption: and one of the things i want to talk

02:30:50.399 --> 02:30:53.680
Caption: about today is what actually it is it to

02:30:52.240 --> 02:30:55.919
Caption: be a computer

02:30:53.679 --> 02:30:57.199
Caption: i did computer science for many years i

02:30:55.919 --> 02:30:58.959
Caption: worked as an academic in computer

02:30:57.200 --> 02:31:01.359
Caption: science for many years and i tell you

02:30:58.959 --> 02:31:02.559
Caption: the 95 of people in that domain probably

02:31:01.359 --> 02:31:04.399
Caption: don&#39;t know what it means to be a

02:31:02.559 --> 02:31:06.239
Caption: computer it&#39;s something you program for

02:31:04.399 --> 02:31:08.000
Caption: sure but what does it mean to be a

02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:09.759
Caption: computer that&#39;s what we&#39;d be talking

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:11.200
Caption: about as well

02:31:09.759 --> 02:31:13.519
Caption: so here&#39;s the sort of overview of the

02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:15.600
Caption: story from my uh talk the first big

02:31:13.519 --> 02:31:17.599
Caption: question is what are computers to get

02:31:15.599 --> 02:31:19.599
Caption: you to understand that question the

02:31:17.599 --> 02:31:21.119
Caption: second one is what am i

02:31:19.599 --> 02:31:22.719

02:31:21.120 --> 02:31:24.399
Caption: similar to me hopefully

02:31:22.719 --> 02:31:26.000
Caption: and then last one the big question there

02:31:24.399 --> 02:31:27.760
Caption: what is i

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:29.439

02:33:07.280 --> 02:33:10.000
Caption: experiences

02:33:08.719 --> 02:33:12.239
Caption: trying to get you to think differently

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:14.240
Caption: about your mind so let&#39;s see how we go

02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:16.160
Caption: with that

02:33:14.240 --> 02:33:17.919
Caption: okay so the first point here what are

02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:19.520
Caption: computers think to yourself what do i

02:33:17.919 --> 02:33:21.359
Caption: what&#39;s you know it&#39;s a digital computer

02:33:19.519 --> 02:33:23.759
Caption: i program it but what do we mean when we

02:33:21.359 --> 02:33:26.160
Caption: talk about computers

02:33:23.759 --> 02:33:27.599
Caption: this sort of thing okay a computer what

02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:28.879
Caption: do we mean by that

02:33:27.599 --> 02:33:30.239
Caption: now maybe if you&#39;re sort of got a

02:33:28.879 --> 02:33:31.759
Caption: computer science background or a

02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:34.160
Caption: technical background you may think oh

02:33:31.759 --> 02:33:36.160
Caption: well computers are equivalent to turing

02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:38.160
Caption: machines or they have a von neumann

02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:40.160
Caption: architecture and so forth there&#39;s

02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:42.399
Caption: something which is runs like this

02:33:40.160 --> 02:33:45.040
Caption: or you may also think you know computer

02:33:42.399 --> 02:33:46.720
Caption: computability can i calculate something

02:33:45.040 --> 02:33:49.120
Caption: with this computer or compute something

02:33:46.719 --> 02:33:51.120
Caption: with an algorithm you may think about

02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:53.600
Caption: algorithms and you may think about oh

02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:56.000
Caption: your computers do calculations these

02:33:53.599 --> 02:33:58.000
Caption: sort of things and these are all correct

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:59.919
Caption: but they don&#39;t get to what the essence

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.160
Caption: is of a computer and that&#39;s what i want

02:33:59.919 --> 02:34:03.519
Caption: to try to explain now this slide has a

02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:05.120
Caption: lot of text so it&#39;s the formal

02:34:03.519 --> 02:34:07.119
Caption: definition of things but i&#39;ll just point

02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:09.280
Caption: out the key points to you i&#39;ll read it

02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:10.240
Caption: out to you it says a computational

02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:12.879
Caption: system

02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:15.600
Caption: is a physical system that allows three

02:34:12.879 --> 02:34:17.280
Caption: specific but more general levels of

02:34:15.599 --> 02:34:19.519
Caption: description

02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:21.200
Caption: above that of the physical level and

02:34:19.519 --> 02:34:23.519
Caption: these three levels are what we call the

02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:25.439
Caption: functional level the symbolic level and

02:34:23.519 --> 02:34:26.239
Caption: the semantic level you may have heard of

02:34:25.439 --> 02:34:28.080
Caption: those

02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:30.319
Caption: there are a couple extra requirements

02:34:28.080 --> 02:34:32.799
Caption: the symbolic states in the symbolic

02:34:30.319 --> 02:34:34.720
Caption: level they refer to things so when your

02:34:32.799 --> 02:34:36.559
Caption: computer has a symbol for a car it&#39;s not

02:34:34.719 --> 02:34:38.559
Caption: actually the car inside the computer

02:34:36.559 --> 02:34:40.159
Caption: it&#39;s a reference to that car

02:34:38.559 --> 02:34:41.358
Caption: and the third one says that the symbols

02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:43.359
Caption: need to be consistent under

02:34:41.359 --> 02:34:45.520
Caption: transformations

02:34:43.359 --> 02:34:46.560
Caption: that&#39;s the definition of a computational

02:34:45.519 --> 02:34:48.398
Caption: system

02:34:46.559 --> 02:34:50.398
Caption: and i want to explain that to you so you

02:34:48.399 --> 02:34:53.280
Caption: can see what computers really are and

02:34:50.399 --> 02:34:54.880
Caption: then we&#39;ll look at how the brain works

02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:57.200
Caption: so of course the computer is a physical

02:34:54.879 --> 02:34:58.478
Caption: system so any physical system we can

02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:00.719
Caption: give a description

02:34:58.478 --> 02:35:02.559
Caption: in terms of the physical states where

02:35:00.719 --> 02:35:04.080
Caption: the particles are in which direction

02:35:02.559 --> 02:35:05.919
Caption: they&#39;re moving

02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:07.599
Caption: and of course they obey the physical

02:35:05.919 --> 02:35:09.359
Caption: laws so the particle&#39;s going to go

02:35:07.599 --> 02:35:10.559
Caption: around ignoring quantum mechanics for

02:35:09.359 --> 02:35:12.319
Caption: now they&#39;re going to move around like

02:35:10.559 --> 02:35:13.839
Caption: particles do and bump bump into things

02:35:12.319 --> 02:35:16.319
Caption: and so forth

02:35:13.839 --> 02:35:18.000
Caption: we can&#39;t break the physical laws but we

02:35:16.319 --> 02:35:20.319
Caption: can change the configuration of the

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.399
Caption: system to make it do things while still

02:35:20.319 --> 02:35:24.840
Caption: obeying those physical laws

02:35:22.399 --> 02:35:26.959
Caption: so we have this physical level

02:35:24.839 --> 02:35:28.959
Caption: description we start off in a physical

02:35:26.959 --> 02:35:30.478
Caption: state on the left our initial state we

02:35:28.959 --> 02:35:32.799
Caption: go to the next state according to the

02:35:30.478 --> 02:35:35.199
Caption: physical laws the physical laws tell us

02:35:32.799 --> 02:35:37.438
Caption: how we go from one state to the next and

02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:39.040
Caption: so on and so on

02:35:37.439 --> 02:35:40.640
Caption: that&#39;s pretty obvious

02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:42.479
Caption: but now what we say that one thing that

02:35:40.639 --> 02:35:44.879
Caption: a computational system allows is that

02:35:42.478 --> 02:35:46.079
Caption: allows a higher level description

02:35:44.879 --> 02:35:47.759
Caption: we don&#39;t need to talk about the

02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:48.959
Caption: particles anymore when you describe your

02:35:47.759 --> 02:35:50.478
Caption: computer you don&#39;t say well these are

02:35:48.959 --> 02:35:51.599
Caption: particles here and particles moving

02:35:50.478 --> 02:35:53.438
Caption: there

02:35:51.599 --> 02:35:55.358
Caption: when you describe a computer in the

02:35:53.439 --> 02:35:57.439
Caption: functional description you describe it

02:35:55.359 --> 02:35:59.439
Caption: in terms of functional states

02:35:57.439 --> 02:36:01.840
Caption: and the functional specification or

02:35:59.439 --> 02:36:03.600
Caption: configuration of that system

02:36:01.839 --> 02:36:06.398
Caption: these functional states are actually

02:36:03.599 --> 02:36:08.318
Caption: defined in terms of equivalent sets of

02:36:06.399 --> 02:36:10.240
Caption: physical states and this is a really

02:36:08.319 --> 02:36:12.080
Caption: important concept we&#39;re going to a

02:36:10.240 --> 02:36:13.759
Caption: higher level description

02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:15.759
Caption: ignoring the difference in certain

02:36:13.759 --> 02:36:18.879
Caption: physical states and we&#39;ll describe it

02:36:15.759 --> 02:36:20.559
Caption: that way let me show you in a picture

02:36:18.879 --> 02:36:22.478
Caption: the first one before i show you that

02:36:20.559 --> 02:36:24.159
Caption: we&#39;re looking at a very simplified model

02:36:22.478 --> 02:36:26.000
Caption: of computing and so forth here which can

02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:27.679
Caption: look at one input gives us a direct

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:29.759
Caption: output and we&#39;ll explain the complexity

02:36:27.679 --> 02:36:31.919
Caption: later on so we on the left we have the

02:36:29.759 --> 02:36:34.559
Caption: input state and on the right we have the

02:36:31.919 --> 02:36:36.719
Caption: output state

02:36:34.559 --> 02:36:38.639
Caption: input goes to output very simple way to

02:36:36.719 --> 02:36:41.599
Caption: understand things

02:36:38.639 --> 02:36:43.679
Caption: so let&#39;s have a look at the next slide

02:36:41.599 --> 02:36:45.599
Caption: sorry i lost my connection there what is

02:36:43.679 --> 02:36:47.519
Caption: this functional description

02:36:45.599 --> 02:36:49.438
Caption: for a computer

02:36:47.519 --> 02:36:51.199
Caption: well as i say we ignore the position of

02:36:49.439 --> 02:36:53.520
Caption: the atoms and then moving around in the

02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:54.640
Caption: electrons and we tend to describe the

02:36:53.519 --> 02:36:56.799
Caption: physical

02:36:54.639 --> 02:36:58.879
Caption: computer in terms of voltages this

02:36:56.799 --> 02:37:01.759
Caption: memory chip this memory cell has a

02:36:58.879 --> 02:37:03.120
Caption: voltage of 0.2 volts or this wire has a

02:37:01.759 --> 02:37:04.719
Caption: voltage

02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:07.120
Caption: so this is another description of a

02:37:04.719 --> 02:37:09.438
Caption: computer above the physical level in

02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:12.160
Caption: terms of these voltages in the

02:37:09.439 --> 02:37:14.640
Caption: particular memory cells for example

02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:17.120
Caption: and of course

02:37:14.639 --> 02:37:20.080
Caption: when you go from the input here 0.2

02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:21.280
Caption: volts you may go to another state 0.9

02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:22.799
Caption: volts

02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:25.280
Caption: but again that&#39;s just really an

02:37:22.799 --> 02:37:26.959
Caption: abstraction over the lower level states

02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:28.879
Caption: lots of different atoms running around

02:37:26.959 --> 02:37:31.519
Caption: in different directions could make

02:37:28.879 --> 02:37:33.120
Caption: equivalent to 0.9 volts

02:37:31.519 --> 02:37:34.879
Caption: so the ones down the bottom are showing

02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:37.839
Caption: you there&#39;s a whole lot of equivalent

02:37:34.879 --> 02:37:40.160
Caption: physical states which correspond to 0.2

02:37:37.839 --> 02:37:42.879
Caption: volts there&#39;s a whole lot of equivalent

02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:45.839
Caption: physical states which correspond to 0.9

02:37:42.879 --> 02:37:47.438
Caption: volts but we ignore that detail and just

02:37:45.839 --> 02:37:49.040
Caption: look at the top

02:37:47.439 --> 02:37:51.280
Caption: so when the system actually goes from

02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:53.439
Caption: input to output it could go from this

02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:55.040
Caption: physical state to that physical state

02:37:53.439 --> 02:37:56.479
Caption: inside the set or it could do a

02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:58.160
Caption: different one or it could do a different

02:37:56.478 --> 02:38:00.478
Caption: one we don&#39;t really care about that

02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:03.919
Caption: detail we just care at the functional

02:38:00.478 --> 02:38:06.398
Caption: level it goes from 0.2 volts to 0.9

02:38:03.919 --> 02:38:08.398
Caption: volts that&#39;s a functional description

02:38:06.399 --> 02:38:10.000
Caption: someone is interested in electronics

02:38:08.399 --> 02:38:11.600
Caption: would probably look at that sort of

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:13.040
Caption: description

02:38:11.599 --> 02:38:15.358
Caption: that&#39;s the functional description of a

02:38:13.040 --> 02:38:17.200
Caption: computer but where it gets interesting

02:38:15.359 --> 02:38:19.200
Caption: now is when we step up one level to this

02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:21.839
Caption: symbolic level description

02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:23.919
Caption: in symbolic states and rules

02:38:21.839 --> 02:38:26.160
Caption: here we have symbols

02:38:23.919 --> 02:38:29.200
Caption: which are referring to things and rules

02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:30.959
Caption: which how they describe how they change

02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:32.640
Caption: so have a look again at our diagram now

02:38:30.959 --> 02:38:35.359
Caption: we think of this computer as a symbol

02:38:32.639 --> 02:38:36.159
Caption: system we have a symbolic state zero or

02:38:35.359 --> 02:38:38.640
Caption: one

02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:41.120
Caption: and that zero one in memory cells could

02:38:38.639 --> 02:38:45.120
Caption: be anything less than 0.5 volts so for

02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:46.240
Caption: 0.4 or 0.2 or 0.3 we don&#39;t care we say

02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:48.319
Caption: it&#39;s a zero

02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:50.479
Caption: a false or a zero bit

02:38:48.319 --> 02:38:52.160
Caption: and going from input to outputs because

02:38:50.478 --> 02:38:54.879
Caption: okay we go from zero to one there&#39;s a

02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:56.879
Caption: rule if zero then one because it&#39;s wired

02:38:54.879 --> 02:39:00.398
Caption: up in this way we don&#39;t care whether the

02:38:56.879 --> 02:39:02.240
Caption: final state is 0.6 or 0.9 we ignore that

02:39:00.399 --> 02:39:03.040
Caption: detail and just say it goes from a 0 to

02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:05.120
Caption: 1.

02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:06.959
Caption: so now we&#39;re thinking about bits we&#39;re

02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:09.439
Caption: working at a symbolic level in terms of

02:39:06.959 --> 02:39:12.639
Caption: symbolic states and the rules which say

02:39:09.439 --> 02:39:14.240
Caption: how they transfer or change

02:39:12.639 --> 02:39:15.919
Caption: so this is the symbol level and this is

02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:18.000
Caption: the level we sort of program computers

02:39:15.919 --> 02:39:19.679
Caption: at and we&#39;ll get back to that as i said

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:21.519
Caption: it doesn&#39;t matter the states below we

02:39:19.679 --> 02:39:23.358
Caption: don&#39;t care about the details of course

02:39:21.519 --> 02:39:25.039
Caption: it is going from one physical state to

02:39:23.359 --> 02:39:28.319
Caption: the next but we just treat them as

02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:30.479
Caption: equivalent at this symbolic level

02:39:28.319 --> 02:39:32.319
Caption: now the last level is the semantic level

02:39:30.478 --> 02:39:34.318
Caption: this is the highest level where we talk

02:39:32.319 --> 02:39:36.879
Caption: about semantic states

02:39:34.319 --> 02:39:38.879
Caption: and principles of operation so we have

02:39:36.879 --> 02:39:40.799
Caption: physical laws we have rules and now we

02:39:38.879 --> 02:39:43.040
Caption: have principles of operation

02:39:40.799 --> 02:39:45.200
Caption: semantic states are similarly defined in

02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:46.639
Caption: sets of equivalent states of equivalent

02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:48.560
Caption: symbolic states

02:39:46.639 --> 02:39:50.398
Caption: and the principles describe how you go

02:39:48.559 --> 02:39:53.519
Caption: from one semantic state to another

02:39:50.399 --> 02:39:56.160
Caption: semantic state

02:39:53.519 --> 02:39:58.398
Caption: this shows you in a computer at the top

02:39:56.160 --> 02:40:00.879
Caption: there we have this semantic level now we

02:39:58.399 --> 02:40:02.479
Caption: represent the symbols below in quotes

02:40:00.879 --> 02:40:04.000
Caption: but how do you sort of represent a

02:40:02.478 --> 02:40:05.199
Caption: semantic state we sort of put them in

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.959
Caption: brackets

02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:09.120
Caption: so on the left for the input state we

02:40:06.959 --> 02:40:10.799
Caption: have four plus two

02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:13.200
Caption: but that&#39;s equivalent to a number of

02:40:10.799 --> 02:40:15.519
Caption: different symbolic states we could be in

02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:16.799
Caption: it could be in four plus two or three

02:40:15.519 --> 02:40:18.318
Caption: plus three

02:40:16.799 --> 02:40:20.240
Caption: doesn&#39;t matter what those symbols are

02:40:18.319 --> 02:40:21.919
Caption: they&#39;re all equivalent to the concept of

02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:23.839
Caption: four plus two

02:40:21.919 --> 02:40:25.280
Caption: and when you use that four plus two

02:40:23.839 --> 02:40:28.318
Caption: semantic state

02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:29.600
Caption: it goes to the semantic state of six

02:40:28.319 --> 02:40:31.280
Caption: and that could be represented in

02:40:29.599 --> 02:40:32.799
Caption: different ways as well it could be the

02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:34.720
Caption: number six or it could be written word

02:40:32.799 --> 02:40:36.639
Caption: six we don&#39;t care

02:40:34.719 --> 02:40:38.959
Caption: so again we&#39;ve gone to a higher level of

02:40:36.639 --> 02:40:41.120
Caption: description which is more easier to

02:40:38.959 --> 02:40:43.359
Caption: understand and more useful the semantic

02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:46.240
Caption: level the semantic level is also called

02:40:43.359 --> 02:40:46.240
Caption: the knowledge level

02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:51.600
Caption: so and again we go at that symbolic

02:40:49.599 --> 02:40:53.679
Caption: level still there it&#39;s not gone away we

02:40:51.599 --> 02:40:55.358
Caption: can go from different symbolic states

02:40:53.679 --> 02:40:57.438
Caption: but we ignore that and just say we go

02:40:55.359 --> 02:40:59.680
Caption: from the four plus two to the sixth

02:40:57.439 --> 02:40:59.680
Caption: state

02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:03.280
Caption: so this is what competition

02:41:01.439 --> 02:41:05.840
Caption: computational systems are

02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:09.200
Caption: a physical system with three levels of

02:41:05.839 --> 02:41:11.200
Caption: abstraction above that physical level

02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:14.080
Caption: going from functional states to symbolic

02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:17.520
Caption: states with rules to semantic states

02:41:14.080 --> 02:41:20.080
Caption: with principles of operations

02:41:17.519 --> 02:41:22.159
Caption: and computers are computational systems

02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:24.160
Caption: as i&#39;ve shown they have these three

02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:26.319
Caption: levels of description and the symbols

02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:28.319
Caption: can refer to things and the symbols can

02:41:26.319 --> 02:41:30.399
Caption: be consistent so computers are

02:41:28.319 --> 02:41:31.840
Caption: computational systems and that&#39;s what we

02:41:30.399 --> 02:41:34.959
Caption: mean what is a computer it&#39;s a

02:41:31.839 --> 02:41:34.959
Caption: computational system

02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:38.319
Caption: so why are they computational systems as

02:41:36.719 --> 02:41:40.398
Caption: i mentioned they have these three

02:41:38.319 --> 02:41:42.160
Caption: different levels the functional level

02:41:40.399 --> 02:41:44.240
Caption: with the voltages and the functional

02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:46.319
Caption: specification the symbolic level with

02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:48.479
Caption: the symbols and the rules of behavior

02:41:46.319 --> 02:41:49.919
Caption: sort of like the code and the semantic

02:41:48.478 --> 02:41:52.559
Caption: level with the concepts and the

02:41:49.919 --> 02:41:52.559
Caption: principles

02:41:53.359 --> 02:41:57.280
Caption: now the nice thing about this is these

02:41:55.120 --> 02:41:59.520
Caption: higher levels of description can ignore

02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:02.080
Caption: the lower level details and you get much

02:41:59.519 --> 02:42:03.839
Caption: more value from a higher level if i told

02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:05.839
Caption: you all the atoms in this thing were

02:42:03.839 --> 02:42:07.679
Caption: this organized you couldn&#39;t tell me much

02:42:05.839 --> 02:42:09.438
Caption: about the thing but if i told you a

02:42:07.679 --> 02:42:11.599
Caption: higher level description it&#39;s more

02:42:09.439 --> 02:42:14.720
Caption: useful to you and this is why we do the

02:42:11.599 --> 02:42:14.719
Caption: levels of abstraction

02:42:14.799 --> 02:42:18.719
Caption: now computers aren&#39;t the only things

02:42:16.399 --> 02:42:20.399
Caption: that are computational systems

02:42:18.719 --> 02:42:21.759
Caption: of course a calculator it&#39;s almost like

02:42:20.399 --> 02:42:24.160
Caption: a computer

02:42:21.759 --> 02:42:26.559
Caption: but even a physical calculator like this

02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:28.080
Caption: is a computational system it&#39;s just got

02:42:26.559 --> 02:42:30.239
Caption: a different implementation it&#39;s not

02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:31.919
Caption: implemented in terms of electronics it&#39;s

02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:33.759
Caption: basically implemented in terms of

02:42:31.919 --> 02:42:35.120
Caption: mechanical states and mechanical

02:42:33.759 --> 02:42:37.120
Caption: configuration

02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:37.919
Caption: but we abstract over those mechanical

02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:39.759
Caption: cache

02:42:37.919 --> 02:42:41.599
Caption: states to say there&#39;s a symbol if the

02:42:39.759 --> 02:42:43.519
Caption: button&#39;s up this high or above this

02:42:41.599 --> 02:42:46.080
Caption: level then it&#39;s a one or if it&#39;s down

02:42:43.519 --> 02:42:47.839
Caption: below this level it&#39;s a zero or so forth

02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:50.639
Caption: so we can implement a computational

02:42:47.839 --> 02:42:53.120
Caption: system in a mechanical system as well

02:42:50.639 --> 02:42:55.120
Caption: and this gives us a good uh

02:42:53.120 --> 02:42:57.759
Caption: hint that possibly we can implement the

02:42:55.120 --> 02:43:00.319
Caption: brain in a non-biological system because

02:42:57.759 --> 02:43:02.080
Caption: we&#39;re abstracting above that biology

02:43:00.319 --> 02:43:04.720
Caption: biology to the functional to the

02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:07.520
Caption: symbolic and semantic levels

02:43:04.719 --> 02:43:08.719
Caption: and again in a calculator the semantics

02:43:07.519 --> 02:43:10.719
Caption: are pretty clear

02:43:08.719 --> 02:43:12.959
Caption: the semantics of a calculator are the

02:43:10.719 --> 02:43:14.719
Caption: number states we don&#39;t care how the

02:43:12.959 --> 02:43:16.559
Caption: numbers represented in the calculator

02:43:14.719 --> 02:43:17.599
Caption: whether it&#39;s buttons or number or a

02:43:16.559 --> 02:43:19.358
Caption: screen

02:43:17.599 --> 02:43:21.438
Caption: and the principles of operations for a

02:43:19.359 --> 02:43:23.600
Caption: calculator are mathematics

02:43:21.439 --> 02:43:26.080
Caption: the add operation the minus operation

02:43:23.599 --> 02:43:28.080
Caption: the multiply operation and the symbols

02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:30.319
Caption: need to be constructed to obey those

02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:32.399
Caption: particular semantics to build a

02:43:30.319 --> 02:43:33.760
Caption: functional calculator

02:43:32.399 --> 02:43:36.080
Caption: so we have lots of different

02:43:33.759 --> 02:43:38.559
Caption: computational systems calculators

02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:40.399
Caption: computers and others

02:43:38.559 --> 02:43:44.000
Caption: but the big question now

02:43:40.399 --> 02:43:45.439
Caption: is to ask what am i and what are you

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:47.599
Caption: and i want to make the claim that we&#39;re

02:43:45.439 --> 02:43:49.600
Caption: a computational system as well and try

02:43:47.599 --> 02:43:50.959
Caption: and explain that

02:43:49.599 --> 02:43:52.318
Caption: now when i&#39;m starting here i&#39;m starting

02:43:50.959 --> 02:43:53.519
Caption: from certain assumptions which you may

02:43:52.319 --> 02:43:54.640
Caption: disagree with but these are my

02:43:53.519 --> 02:43:56.559
Caption: assumptions

02:43:54.639 --> 02:43:59.679
Caption: my assumption is that basically we&#39;re a

02:43:56.559 --> 02:44:01.199
Caption: biological information processing system

02:43:59.679 --> 02:44:02.959
Caption: we don&#39;t have electrons running around

02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:05.120
Caption: in our brain in our neurons we have ions

02:44:02.959 --> 02:44:07.519
Caption: running around doing some similar stuff

02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:10.240
Caption: but basically it&#39;s a wiring system to

02:44:07.519 --> 02:44:11.679
Caption: make our information processing happen

02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:13.600
Caption: so we&#39;re not assuming there&#39;s any sort

02:44:11.679 --> 02:44:15.759
Caption: of ghost in the machine or souls or

02:44:13.599 --> 02:44:17.679
Caption: spirits we&#39;re saying everything about us

02:44:15.759 --> 02:44:20.719
Caption: needs to be explained in terms of this

02:44:17.679 --> 02:44:24.239
Caption: biological information processing system

02:44:20.719 --> 02:44:26.639
Caption: and we want to try and do that now

02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:29.040
Caption: so of course here&#39;s a physical system my

02:44:26.639 --> 02:44:31.599
Caption: son we can describe him in a physical

02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:32.799
Caption: states and physical laws

02:44:31.599 --> 02:44:35.199
Caption: but we&#39;re interested in the whole body

02:44:32.799 --> 02:44:36.559
Caption: we&#39;re interested in just the brain

02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:38.640
Caption: so we can have a physical level

02:44:36.559 --> 02:44:40.799
Caption: description of the brain its physical

02:44:38.639 --> 02:44:42.559
Caption: states and physical laws that say how

02:44:40.799 --> 02:44:43.839
Caption: those states will change because of

02:44:42.559 --> 02:44:45.278
Caption: course the brain

02:44:43.839 --> 02:44:47.599
Caption: operates under the physical laws it

02:44:45.279 --> 02:44:49.040
Caption: can&#39;t break those laws

02:44:47.599 --> 02:44:50.478
Caption: but we want to have a look inside that

02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:53.279
Caption: and say hey what&#39;s inside the brain all

02:44:50.478 --> 02:44:54.398
Caption: these neuron things like the wiring and

02:44:53.279 --> 02:44:56.000
Caption: basically if you don&#39;t know about it

02:44:54.399 --> 02:44:58.399
Caption: they have connections at the end where

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:00.799
Caption: other neurons connect to they add up all

02:44:58.399 --> 02:45:03.040
Caption: the symbols coming in if it goes over a

02:45:00.799 --> 02:45:05.200
Caption: certain threshold then the neuron sends

02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:06.559
Caption: out a signal if it doesn&#39;t it stays

02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:08.000
Caption: pretty quiet

02:45:06.559 --> 02:45:09.199
Caption: so this is the sort of mathematical

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.719
Caption: equation on the right but that&#39;s how

02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:12.719
Caption: neurons look like

02:45:10.719 --> 02:45:14.398
Caption: inside our brain there are apparently 80

02:45:12.719 --> 02:45:16.160
Caption: billion neurons

02:45:14.399 --> 02:45:17.439
Caption: it&#39;s down on we used to think it was 100

02:45:16.160 --> 02:45:18.959
Caption: billion but they did some more studies

02:45:17.439 --> 02:45:20.800
Caption: and we&#39;ve got 20 billion less but

02:45:18.959 --> 02:45:22.799
Caption: doesn&#39;t make us any less smart we can

02:45:20.799 --> 02:45:24.959
Caption: still do a lot with 80 billion

02:45:22.799 --> 02:45:27.278
Caption: it&#39;s a complex network of these neurons

02:45:24.959 --> 02:45:28.879
Caption: in the brain

02:45:27.279 --> 02:45:30.959
Caption: so how do we look at this in terms of

02:45:28.879 --> 02:45:32.240
Caption: computational systems

02:45:30.959 --> 02:45:34.000
Caption: the first thing is of course that

02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:36.640
Caption: physical level description i mentioned

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:39.040
Caption: physical states and physical laws the

02:45:36.639 --> 02:45:40.559
Caption: brain obeys physics can&#39;t not obey

02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:42.559
Caption: physics

02:45:40.559 --> 02:45:44.239
Caption: and it goes from state to state

02:45:42.559 --> 02:45:45.919
Caption: but now when it gets interesting we talk

02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:47.040
Caption: about the functional level description

02:45:45.919 --> 02:45:48.559
Caption: of the brain

02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:50.319
Caption: so we&#39;re going to abstract away from

02:45:48.559 --> 02:45:51.839
Caption: those physical states

02:45:50.319 --> 02:45:54.319
Caption: and so let&#39;s look about let&#39;s talk about

02:45:51.839 --> 02:45:56.478
Caption: the firing rate of a neuron not about

02:45:54.319 --> 02:45:58.560
Caption: where all the ions and atoms are inside

02:45:56.478 --> 02:46:00.478
Caption: the neuron let&#39;s abstract away and we

02:45:58.559 --> 02:46:02.799
Caption: can say the neuron is firing at this

02:46:00.478 --> 02:46:04.799
Caption: rate or that rate or this rate or that

02:46:02.799 --> 02:46:06.240
Caption: weight it&#39;s usually a low rate or a high

02:46:04.799 --> 02:46:08.080
Caption: rate

02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:10.319
Caption: and the way the actual brain is is

02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:12.160
Caption: configured is sort of wired so it&#39;s

02:46:10.319 --> 02:46:13.600
Caption: functional specification is sort of like

02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:15.359
Caption: the wiring of the

02:46:13.599 --> 02:46:17.358
Caption: computer circuits but now it&#39;s the

02:46:15.359 --> 02:46:18.880
Caption: wiring of these neurons

02:46:17.359 --> 02:46:20.720
Caption: so when we look at the brain we can

02:46:18.879 --> 02:46:23.279
Caption: abstract over those physical states and

02:46:20.719 --> 02:46:25.679
Caption: say this neuron here is firing or not

02:46:23.279 --> 02:46:27.520
Caption: firing that&#39;s the input and then the

02:46:25.679 --> 02:46:29.278
Caption: output has some sort of rule set up

02:46:27.519 --> 02:46:31.039
Caption: because of the configuration to be

02:46:29.279 --> 02:46:32.879
Caption: firing or not firing

02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:34.879
Caption: so we&#39;re abstracting over the physical

02:46:32.879 --> 02:46:38.879
Caption: states to get a functional description

02:46:34.879 --> 02:46:40.959
Caption: in terms of firing rates of the neurons

02:46:38.879 --> 02:46:42.319
Caption: now as i say we&#39;re looking at simplified

02:46:40.959 --> 02:46:44.959
Caption: systems here we&#39;re not going to actually

02:46:42.319 --> 02:46:46.479
Caption: look at uh complex systems

02:46:44.959 --> 02:46:48.399
Caption: so

02:46:46.478 --> 02:46:49.759
Caption: it&#39;s more here just an input output

02:46:48.399 --> 02:46:51.439
Caption: we&#39;re not looking at the complexes of

02:46:49.759 --> 02:46:52.879
Caption: all parts of the brains just yet input

02:46:51.439 --> 02:46:57.200
Caption: and output so we&#39;re in a particular

02:46:52.879 --> 02:46:57.200
Caption: input state we go to an output state

02:46:57.679 --> 02:47:01.278
Caption: that&#39;s the symbolic oh sorry now look at

02:46:59.359 --> 02:47:03.600
Caption: the symbolic level description the

02:47:01.279 --> 02:47:05.200
Caption: symbolic level abstracts against above

02:47:03.599 --> 02:47:06.719
Caption: those firing rates

02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:09.759
Caption: so we don&#39;t care whether the firing

02:47:06.719 --> 02:47:12.160
Caption: weight is 10 firings per second or five

02:47:09.759 --> 02:47:14.879
Caption: firings per second if it&#39;s low that&#39;s

02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:17.919
Caption: considered a zero now if it&#39;s very high

02:47:14.879 --> 02:47:20.478
Caption: firing rate 20 30 50 100 firings per

02:47:17.919 --> 02:47:22.398
Caption: second then we consider it a one

02:47:20.478 --> 02:47:23.278
Caption: so we&#39;ve got this on and off switch

02:47:22.399 --> 02:47:25.680
Caption: again

02:47:23.279 --> 02:47:27.680
Caption: sort of like a bit but of course neurons

02:47:25.679 --> 02:47:30.160
Caption: aren&#39;t bits they&#39;re very unreliable they

02:47:27.679 --> 02:47:31.759
Caption: tend to work in collections but for our

02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:35.040
Caption: abstraction here just think of them as a

02:47:31.759 --> 02:47:37.438
Caption: single bit in the brain so the brain is

02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:39.599
Caption: configured to go from symbolic state to

02:47:37.439 --> 02:47:41.120
Caption: symbolic state one neuron turns on the

02:47:39.599 --> 02:47:42.239
Caption: other one turns off because of their

02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:44.000
Caption: connections

02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:45.919
Caption: we can ignore the details of all the

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:47.839
Caption: firing and just think about these

02:47:45.919 --> 02:47:50.319
Caption: symbolic states the higher level

02:47:47.839 --> 02:47:50.318
Caption: description

02:47:50.639 --> 02:47:54.959
Caption: so what about the semantic level well

02:47:52.639 --> 02:47:56.719
Caption: now we can abstract again over those

02:47:54.959 --> 02:47:58.000
Caption: symbolic states

02:47:56.719 --> 02:47:59.759
Caption: and say hey

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:01.679
Caption: down the bottom here we have some inputs

02:47:59.759 --> 02:48:04.478
Caption: coming into the computer maybe the

02:48:01.679 --> 02:48:07.040
Caption: import is something like you see a cat

02:48:04.478 --> 02:48:08.000
Caption: or you hear a cat or you read the word

02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:10.319
Caption: cat

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:13.519
Caption: you know lots of inputs lots of bits are

02:48:10.319 --> 02:48:16.399
Caption: firing in your brain when you see a cat

02:48:13.519 --> 02:48:18.639
Caption: that&#39;s the symbolic level seeing a cat

02:48:16.399 --> 02:48:21.840
Caption: but up the top there we now have this

02:48:18.639 --> 02:48:23.519
Caption: semantic state oh we&#39;re seeing a cat

02:48:21.839 --> 02:48:26.160
Caption: we don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s this cat or

02:48:23.519 --> 02:48:28.079
Caption: that cat or how we see the cat our brain

02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:30.560
Caption: says we&#39;ll operate the same way no

02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:31.520
Caption: matter what the different symbols are

02:48:30.559 --> 02:48:33.759
Caption: and what we&#39;re going to do in this

02:48:31.519 --> 02:48:35.519
Caption: simple case is announce the cat hey

02:48:33.759 --> 02:48:37.438
Caption: there&#39;s the cat

02:48:35.519 --> 02:48:39.919
Caption: but we also don&#39;t mind how we announced

02:48:37.439 --> 02:48:42.560
Caption: the cat we could say cat or we could

02:48:39.919 --> 02:48:44.719
Caption: write cat or we could shout cat

02:48:42.559 --> 02:48:47.040
Caption: again input goes to output we don&#39;t care

02:48:44.719 --> 02:48:50.879
Caption: how the symbols work as long as it

02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:50.879
Caption: is consistent with this semantic level

02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:56.000
Caption: that&#39;s the semantic level description

02:48:53.679 --> 02:48:59.278
Caption: of how the brain works see a cat you

02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:01.359
Caption: announce a cat just to make it clear

02:48:59.279 --> 02:49:04.399
Caption: on the left is our input on the right is

02:49:01.359 --> 02:49:05.760
Caption: our output so we see this cat we shout

02:49:04.399 --> 02:49:07.840
Caption: cat

02:49:05.759 --> 02:49:09.519
Caption: but hey it could be a different cat it&#39;s

02:49:07.839 --> 02:49:12.240
Caption: a different symbol but the same

02:49:09.519 --> 02:49:14.799
Caption: semantics to us in our operation is that

02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:16.879
Caption: it&#39;s just a cat so we&#39;ll say cat

02:49:14.799 --> 02:49:19.120
Caption: and of course you could say cat in sign

02:49:16.879 --> 02:49:20.398
Caption: language rather than saying cat

02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:23.359
Caption: it doesn&#39;t matter these different

02:49:20.399 --> 02:49:25.520
Caption: symbolic operations are still equivalent

02:49:23.359 --> 02:49:26.880
Caption: enough we&#39;re announcing there&#39;s a cat

02:49:25.519 --> 02:49:28.639
Caption: and it could be a whole lot of different

02:49:26.879 --> 02:49:30.559
Caption: cats and we could say things in

02:49:28.639 --> 02:49:32.559
Caption: different ways and so forth

02:49:30.559 --> 02:49:34.719
Caption: so the semantic level describes this

02:49:32.559 --> 02:49:36.799
Caption: higher level you&#39;re seeing this concept

02:49:34.719 --> 02:49:39.358
Caption: of a cat and you&#39;re reacting to it in a

02:49:36.799 --> 02:49:42.398
Caption: certain way

02:49:39.359 --> 02:49:44.399
Caption: so brains are computational systems they

02:49:42.399 --> 02:49:45.920
Caption: have those three levels of descriptions

02:49:44.399 --> 02:49:49.279
Caption: we talked about

02:49:45.919 --> 02:49:51.359
Caption: uh before symbolic and so forth

02:49:49.279 --> 02:49:53.520
Caption: the functional level the symbolic level

02:49:51.359 --> 02:49:54.959
Caption: and the semantic level

02:49:53.519 --> 02:49:58.398
Caption: and again these higher levels

02:49:54.959 --> 02:50:01.519
Caption: abstractions are very useful

02:49:58.399 --> 02:50:03.840
Caption: another example you see a fire

02:50:01.519 --> 02:50:06.159
Caption: of course your action may be

02:50:03.839 --> 02:50:09.120
Caption: scream out fire

02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:11.839
Caption: but your conceptual semantic level could

02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:13.919
Caption: be if we see danger then sort of panic

02:50:11.839 --> 02:50:16.080
Caption: or do something like that so it doesn&#39;t

02:50:13.919 --> 02:50:17.679
Caption: matter to us whether we see the smoke we

02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:19.599
Caption: still may shout fire

02:50:17.679 --> 02:50:22.318
Caption: and it doesn&#39;t matter whether we see

02:50:19.599 --> 02:50:25.278
Caption: we shout fire or we run away okay we&#39;re

02:50:22.319 --> 02:50:28.479
Caption: doing something equivalent action or

02:50:25.279 --> 02:50:30.240
Caption: dial 9-1-1 again at the semantic level

02:50:28.478 --> 02:50:32.398
Caption: the behavior is described as you see a

02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:36.200
Caption: fire or you hear fire or whatever fire

02:50:32.399 --> 02:50:36.200
Caption: you panic or do something

02:50:36.319 --> 02:50:39.919
Caption: so that&#39;s the semantic level description

02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:41.919
Caption: of the brain

02:50:39.919 --> 02:50:43.438
Caption: now if you say brain is a computational

02:50:41.919 --> 02:50:44.799
Caption: system and i hope it&#39;s sort of convinced

02:50:43.439 --> 02:50:46.319
Caption: a bit there

02:50:44.799 --> 02:50:48.839
Caption: the key thing to note here that it

02:50:46.319 --> 02:50:51.040
Caption: explains everything but it also explains

02:50:48.839 --> 02:50:52.879
Caption: nothing what does it explain well it

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:55.200
Caption: explains what type of system the brain

02:50:52.879 --> 02:50:57.599
Caption: is it&#39;s a computational system

02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:59.359
Caption: that&#39;s really important it explains how

02:50:57.599 --> 02:51:00.959
Caption: the human bay of behavior works we have

02:50:59.359 --> 02:51:02.640
Caption: these different levels which abstract

02:51:00.959 --> 02:51:04.319
Caption: over each other

02:51:02.639 --> 02:51:06.159
Caption: and it provides an operational

02:51:04.319 --> 02:51:08.240
Caption: definition of meaning

02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:10.080
Caption: what is the meaning of the cat it&#39;s all

02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:12.399
Caption: these different symbolic behaviors which

02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:14.639
Caption: are equivalent to that we&#39;re abstracting

02:51:12.399 --> 02:51:16.720
Caption: over the set of symbols

02:51:14.639 --> 02:51:18.959
Caption: that&#39;s very important things it doesn&#39;t

02:51:16.719 --> 02:51:20.639
Caption: explain it doesn&#39;t tell us the complete

02:51:18.959 --> 02:51:22.000
Caption: wiring of the brain

02:51:20.639 --> 02:51:23.759
Caption: we&#39;re still working that out trying to

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:25.040
Caption: understand the functional architecture

02:51:23.759 --> 02:51:27.919
Caption: of the brain

02:51:25.040 --> 02:51:29.359
Caption: and it doesn&#39;t explain how brains learn

02:51:27.919 --> 02:51:30.959
Caption: which is a very important thing we&#39;ll

02:51:29.359 --> 02:51:32.959
Caption: see soon

02:51:30.959 --> 02:51:35.279
Caption: calculators don&#39;t learn but brains do

02:51:32.959 --> 02:51:35.279
Caption: learn

02:51:35.599 --> 02:51:39.119
Caption: so let&#39;s talk a bit about now how we

02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:41.759
Caption: could maybe implement a mind which is

02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:42.959
Caption: the running program of a brain and there

02:51:41.759 --> 02:51:44.559
Caption: are two different approaches the

02:51:42.959 --> 02:51:46.399
Caption: classical approach the old-fashioned

02:51:44.559 --> 02:51:48.559
Caption: approach which was classical ai

02:51:46.399 --> 02:51:50.479
Caption: you may have heard of expert systems

02:51:48.559 --> 02:51:52.719
Caption: these were symbol systems they worked

02:51:50.478 --> 02:51:54.959
Caption: with symbols like cat and dog and

02:51:52.719 --> 02:51:56.000
Caption: produced responses like say hello or

02:51:54.959 --> 02:51:57.839
Caption: whatever

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:00.080
Caption: and now these new connectionist ones or

02:51:57.839 --> 02:52:02.160
Caption: neural network approaches these were

02:52:00.080 --> 02:52:03.919
Caption: different they were sort of lower level

02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:06.959
Caption: i want to explain how they differ in

02:52:03.919 --> 02:52:08.719
Caption: terms of this computational model

02:52:06.959 --> 02:52:10.799
Caption: so first of all we said that a classical

02:52:08.719 --> 02:52:13.040
Caption: digital computer and a brain are both

02:52:10.799 --> 02:52:14.719
Caption: computational systems they both have

02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:15.919
Caption: three different levels symbolic and

02:52:14.719 --> 02:52:17.679
Caption: semantic

02:52:15.919 --> 02:52:19.519
Caption: they&#39;re similar in that way

02:52:17.679 --> 02:52:21.519
Caption: but how are they different a classical

02:52:19.519 --> 02:52:23.119
Caption: digital computer

02:52:21.519 --> 02:52:25.119
Caption: the difference is this

02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:26.240
Caption: when we program a classical digital

02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:28.879
Caption: computer

02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:32.319
Caption: we program at the symbolic level

02:52:28.879 --> 02:52:34.478
Caption: so the computer wiring is set up for us

02:52:32.319 --> 02:52:36.879
Caption: and we program by saying here comes the

02:52:34.478 --> 02:52:38.879
Caption: symbolic the symbols and the rules which

02:52:36.879 --> 02:52:40.639
Caption: will say how those symbols change which

02:52:38.879 --> 02:52:42.639
Caption: is your code

02:52:40.639 --> 02:52:44.000
Caption: but the mind doesn&#39;t have a program at

02:52:42.639 --> 02:52:46.000
Caption: the symbol level

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:49.359
Caption: it&#39;s only programmed at the functional

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:51.040
Caption: level the wiring that the genes specify

02:52:49.359 --> 02:52:51.919
Caption: so where do the symbols come from in the

02:52:51.040 --> 02:52:53.839
Caption: brain

02:52:51.919 --> 02:52:55.839
Caption: they&#39;re actually learned

02:52:53.839 --> 02:52:57.519
Caption: these symbols and the rules which say

02:52:55.839 --> 02:53:00.160
Caption: how they move from one to the other your

02:52:57.519 --> 02:53:01.919
Caption: behavior actually emerges as you learn

02:53:00.160 --> 02:53:04.799
Caption: and watch the environment

02:53:01.919 --> 02:53:07.120
Caption: and the semantics emerge as well

02:53:04.799 --> 02:53:08.318
Caption: so the symbols emerge and the semantics

02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:10.719
Caption: emerge

02:53:08.319 --> 02:53:13.760
Caption: this raises a big question for me

02:53:10.719 --> 02:53:16.160
Caption: are mines turing equivalent

02:53:13.759 --> 02:53:18.318
Caption: we have a look on the left hand side

02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:20.080
Caption: classical ai the symbols there will

02:53:18.319 --> 02:53:22.240
Caption: match the symbols in a turing machine

02:53:20.080 --> 02:53:23.839
Caption: yes it&#39;s like a turing machine

02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:26.160
Caption: but on the right hand side when we start

02:53:23.839 --> 02:53:27.759
Caption: off with the mind there are no symbols

02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:30.160
Caption: and these symbols emerge and they&#39;re

02:53:27.759 --> 02:53:32.240
Caption: continuously changing and the rules are

02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:33.759
Caption: emerging and changing but a turing

02:53:32.240 --> 02:53:36.319
Caption: machine says we have these particular

02:53:33.759 --> 02:53:37.919
Caption: symbols and these rules

02:53:36.319 --> 02:53:40.080
Caption: i claim that&#39;s not really a turing

02:53:37.919 --> 02:53:41.919
Caption: machine equivalent because it&#39;s

02:53:40.080 --> 02:53:45.040
Caption: defining and emerging symbols rather

02:53:41.919 --> 02:53:45.040
Caption: than having them specified

02:53:45.279 --> 02:53:48.800
Caption: but how do we actually um or the

02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:51.919
Caption: similarities now between a neural

02:53:48.799 --> 02:53:53.839
Caption: network type solution a connectionist ai

02:53:51.919 --> 02:53:56.000
Caption: and the mind when we set up neural

02:53:53.839 --> 02:53:58.080
Caption: networks with aws or your own

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:59.919
Caption: programming you&#39;re basically specifying

02:53:58.080 --> 02:54:02.160
Caption: the functional level how these

02:53:59.919 --> 02:54:04.240
Caption: artificial neurons are connected and

02:54:02.160 --> 02:54:06.399
Caption: then it tries to learn so it learns

02:54:04.240 --> 02:54:07.759
Caption: symbols i can recognize a cat and say

02:54:06.399 --> 02:54:09.520
Caption: cat

02:54:07.759 --> 02:54:12.318
Caption: so it&#39;s very similar to the mind

02:54:09.519 --> 02:54:14.079
Caption: specified at the functional level

02:54:12.319 --> 02:54:16.080
Caption: now when we&#39;re trying to implement one

02:54:14.080 --> 02:54:17.759
Caption: of these artificial neural networks at

02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:19.359
Caption: the functional level how can we

02:54:17.759 --> 02:54:21.759
Caption: implement it well we could make our own

02:54:19.359 --> 02:54:23.520
Caption: neurons but we tend to like to use a

02:54:21.759 --> 02:54:25.040
Caption: classical computer

02:54:23.519 --> 02:54:27.199
Caption: to implement

02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:28.879
Caption: a neural network and run it how does

02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:30.479
Caption: that work

02:54:28.879 --> 02:54:31.279
Caption: this shows you how what actually happens

02:54:30.478 --> 02:54:33.199
Caption: here

02:54:31.279 --> 02:54:36.240
Caption: what actually happens we use a classical

02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:38.879
Caption: computer program a symbolic system

02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:41.919
Caption: so you write some code but the code you

02:54:38.879 --> 02:54:43.679
Caption: write the symbols in your program are

02:54:41.919 --> 02:54:46.000
Caption: not equivalent to the symbols in the

02:54:43.679 --> 02:54:48.398
Caption: mind or the connectionist system

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:50.719
Caption: the symbols you use in your program

02:54:48.399 --> 02:54:52.000
Caption: match the functional level

02:54:50.719 --> 02:54:53.759
Caption: of the uh

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:56.240
Caption: connection of system so you&#39;re using

02:54:53.759 --> 02:54:57.919
Caption: your symbols to say specify the firing

02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:00.240
Caption: rate of the neurons

02:54:57.919 --> 02:55:02.478
Caption: not the symbols themselves

02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:04.399
Caption: so we&#39;re using symbols at a different

02:55:02.478 --> 02:55:06.559
Caption: level that&#39;s why they&#39;re not equivalent

02:55:04.399 --> 02:55:09.760
Caption: so we can implement these connection of

02:55:06.559 --> 02:55:11.358
Caption: systems in classical ai symbol systems

02:55:09.759 --> 02:55:15.478
Caption: but we&#39;re implementing them by

02:55:11.359 --> 02:55:15.479
Caption: implementing their functional level

02:55:16.399 --> 02:55:20.479
Caption: okay so this is what the conclusion of

02:55:18.399 --> 02:55:22.640
Caption: my sort of research was my phd and so

02:55:20.478 --> 02:55:24.000
Caption: forth there are two different types of

02:55:22.639 --> 02:55:26.719
Caption: computation

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:28.478
Caption: there&#39;s what i call discrete computation

02:55:26.719 --> 02:55:30.398
Caption: this is where you specify in your

02:55:28.478 --> 02:55:32.719
Caption: program everything up to the symbol

02:55:30.399 --> 02:55:35.920
Caption: level so you write the program in terms

02:55:32.719 --> 02:55:38.478
Caption: of symbols to define some semantic level

02:55:35.919 --> 02:55:41.839
Caption: you&#39;re writing some calculator code to

02:55:38.478 --> 02:55:44.478
Caption: make a calculator implement mathematics

02:55:41.839 --> 02:55:46.959
Caption: discrete because the rules are chunky if

02:55:44.478 --> 02:55:48.478
Caption: this then that the symbols are precise

02:55:46.959 --> 02:55:51.919
Caption: and static

02:55:48.478 --> 02:55:53.839
Caption: i call it discrete computation

02:55:51.919 --> 02:55:55.359
Caption: the brain however as i&#39;m trying to imply

02:55:53.839 --> 02:55:58.318
Caption: to you here is different

02:55:55.359 --> 02:56:00.080
Caption: i call it continuous computation because

02:55:58.319 --> 02:56:02.399
Caption: again it&#39;s only specified at the

02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:05.599
Caption: physical and the functional level

02:56:02.399 --> 02:56:07.680
Caption: the symbols and the semantics emerge as

02:56:05.599 --> 02:56:09.519
Caption: a result of learning i&#39;m trying to show

02:56:07.679 --> 02:56:12.398
Caption: you there the wiggly symbols rather than

02:56:09.519 --> 02:56:14.239
Caption: square boxes preset values the symbols

02:56:12.399 --> 02:56:16.479
Caption: emerge and your definition or

02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:18.879
Caption: understanding or operational behavior

02:56:16.478 --> 02:56:21.199
Caption: with regards to cats change as you learn

02:56:18.879 --> 02:56:23.358
Caption: about cats and you see more cats your

02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:25.120
Caption: brain always changes and the phys and

02:56:23.359 --> 02:56:27.760
Caption: the symbols and the rules are in

02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:29.040
Caption: continuous dynamic flux and evolving

02:56:27.759 --> 02:56:32.879
Caption: continuously

02:56:29.040 --> 02:56:34.479
Caption: so continuous computational systems

02:56:32.879 --> 02:56:36.160
Caption: so there we go

02:56:34.478 --> 02:56:37.278
Caption: i hope i&#39;ve shown you or given you an

02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:39.839
Caption: idea

02:56:37.279 --> 02:56:40.720
Caption: that i am a computer a computational

02:56:39.839 --> 02:56:42.478
Caption: system

02:56:40.719 --> 02:56:45.759
Caption: and you are too

02:56:42.478 --> 02:56:48.159
Caption: but to be more precise about this

02:56:45.759 --> 02:56:50.318
Caption: i&#39;m a continuous computational system

02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:52.799
Caption: and you are too so we&#39;re not like a

02:56:50.319 --> 02:56:54.720
Caption: classical computer program with symbols

02:56:52.799 --> 02:56:56.799
Caption: where i could compute a continuous

02:56:54.719 --> 02:56:58.959
Caption: computational system with emerging

02:56:56.799 --> 02:57:00.160
Caption: symbols and emerging rules and emerging

02:56:58.959 --> 02:57:01.519
Caption: semantics

02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:03.679
Caption: and of course the learning has to be

02:57:01.519 --> 02:57:06.559
Caption: good to ensure we actually emerge and

02:57:03.679 --> 02:57:06.559
Caption: learn things properly

02:57:06.959 --> 02:57:10.000
Caption: okay so um

02:57:08.559 --> 02:57:11.599
Caption: that leads us to the big question now

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:14.160
Caption: what is i and this we get some audience

02:57:11.599 --> 02:57:14.879
Caption: participation in this one

02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:16.959
Caption: so

02:57:14.879 --> 02:57:18.240
Caption: what is i well what are we there&#39;s a lot

02:57:16.959 --> 02:57:19.839
Caption: of things that people talk about when

02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:21.759
Caption: they talk about i

02:57:19.839 --> 02:57:23.279
Caption: they talk about

02:57:21.759 --> 02:57:26.160
Caption: awareness

02:57:23.279 --> 02:57:27.520
Caption: self-awareness free will

02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:29.040
Caption: qualia if you don&#39;t know what that means

02:57:27.519 --> 02:57:30.799
Caption: we&#39;ll explain it in a second and

02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:32.240
Caption: consciousness of course

02:57:30.799 --> 02:57:34.478
Caption: these are the big questions the

02:57:32.240 --> 02:57:36.319
Caption: consciousness one is called a clm

02:57:34.478 --> 02:57:38.719
Caption: career limiting move if you start to

02:57:36.319 --> 02:57:41.200
Caption: researching consciousness then your

02:57:38.719 --> 02:57:41.200
Caption: chances of

02:57:48.959 --> 02:57:52.799
Caption: regards to succe systems

02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:56.240
Caption: the first one awareness i think is quite

02:57:55.120 --> 02:57:58.000
Caption: easy if you think about it

02:57:56.240 --> 02:58:00.080
Caption: computationally

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:01.679
Caption: if you&#39;re aware of something say in your

02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:04.399
Caption: environment

02:58:01.679 --> 02:58:07.199
Caption: it basically means you show consistent

02:58:04.399 --> 02:58:08.880
Caption: and appropriate behavior with respect to

02:58:07.200 --> 02:58:10.399
Caption: perceptions of it

02:58:08.879 --> 02:58:12.719
Caption: so for example if i&#39;m aware of this

02:58:10.399 --> 02:58:14.640
Caption: microphone i know not to touch it and i

02:58:12.719 --> 02:58:16.719
Caption: know if i need to touch it

02:58:14.639 --> 02:58:19.199
Caption: my symbols are working properly in a

02:58:16.719 --> 02:58:20.799
Caption: nice semantically consistent way

02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:23.040
Caption: but if i don&#39;t unaware of that

02:58:20.799 --> 02:58:24.959
Caption: microphone and i bump it

02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:26.959
Caption: i haven&#39;t been aware of it my system

02:58:24.959 --> 02:58:28.240
Caption: symbols and so forth wasn&#39;t aware of

02:58:26.959 --> 02:58:30.399
Caption: that

02:58:28.240 --> 02:58:32.319
Caption: so my behavior to it wasn&#39;t appropriate

02:58:30.399 --> 02:58:33.600
Caption: or successful in terms of what i was

02:58:32.319 --> 02:58:34.879
Caption: doing

02:58:33.599 --> 02:58:36.398
Caption: similar with

02:58:34.879 --> 02:58:37.358
Caption: seeing objects other objects in the

02:58:36.399 --> 02:58:39.920
Caption: world

02:58:37.359 --> 02:58:42.240
Caption: so awareness is about really having some

02:58:39.919 --> 02:58:44.240
Caption: computational semantics which are

02:58:42.240 --> 02:58:46.640
Caption: appropriate for the things you&#39;re trying

02:58:44.240 --> 02:58:48.000
Caption: to be aware of are these three levels

02:58:46.639 --> 02:58:49.519
Caption: there

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:51.839
Caption: now there&#39;s a classic example of where

02:58:49.519 --> 02:58:54.159
Caption: this goes wrong there&#39;s a famous book in

02:58:51.839 --> 02:58:55.519
Caption: research it says the man who mistook his

02:58:54.160 --> 02:58:57.200
Caption: wife for a hat

02:58:55.519 --> 02:58:58.799
Caption: he had a brain disorder when he thought

02:58:57.200 --> 02:59:01.839
Caption: his wife&#39;s head was a hat and was trying

02:58:58.799 --> 02:59:03.839
Caption: to put it on very sad of course

02:59:01.839 --> 02:59:05.919
Caption: but i hope you see what this means it

02:59:03.839 --> 02:59:08.000
Caption: means it hasn&#39;t got the right symbols

02:59:05.919 --> 02:59:10.080
Caption: and the right semantics for the hat so

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:12.639
Caption: the behavior is inappropriate

02:59:10.080 --> 02:59:15.040
Caption: so it&#39;s failed so he hasn&#39;t really got

02:59:12.639 --> 02:59:16.799
Caption: this awareness of a hat for what it

02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:18.879
Caption: really is it hasn&#39;t got the

02:59:16.799 --> 02:59:20.160
Caption: computational levels set up and working

02:59:18.879 --> 02:59:21.519
Caption: correctly

02:59:20.160 --> 02:59:22.799
Caption: true story you can read about that a

02:59:21.519 --> 02:59:24.879
Caption: book by alive

02:59:22.799 --> 02:59:26.879
Caption: oliver sacks

02:59:24.879 --> 02:59:28.240
Caption: what about self-awareness

02:59:26.879 --> 02:59:29.919
Caption: well it&#39;s the same sort of thing but as

02:59:28.240 --> 02:59:31.759
Caption: you go through life of course you see

02:59:29.919 --> 02:59:33.519
Caption: your body with you it&#39;s all around there

02:59:31.759 --> 02:59:35.519
Caption: and you start to behave consistently

02:59:33.519 --> 02:59:38.318
Caption: with regards to your body

02:59:35.519 --> 02:59:39.839
Caption: so you&#39;re aware of yourself being with

02:59:38.319 --> 02:59:42.000
Caption: you all the time

02:59:39.839 --> 02:59:44.478
Caption: self-awareness is consistent appropriate

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:46.879
Caption: behavior with respect to internal and

02:59:44.478 --> 02:59:48.879
Caption: external perceptions of yourself so i

02:59:46.879 --> 02:59:50.398
Caption: see this thing here and i&#39;m set up

02:59:48.879 --> 02:59:52.559
Caption: correctly i&#39;ve learned correctly this is

02:59:50.399 --> 02:59:54.240
Caption: my hand it&#39;s not someone else&#39;s hand

02:59:52.559 --> 02:59:56.559
Caption: right and i know i can control it and do

02:59:54.240 --> 02:59:58.160
Caption: things with it

02:59:56.559 --> 02:59:59.599
Caption: as i mentioned here it&#39;s not just

02:59:58.160 --> 03:00:01.520
Caption: external stuff

02:59:59.599 --> 03:00:03.599
Caption: when you talk externally you can hear

03:00:01.519 --> 03:00:04.959
Caption: yourself but also we have this loop

03:00:03.599 --> 03:00:06.719
Caption: going on in our head where we can

03:00:04.959 --> 03:00:09.519
Caption: actually hear ourselves we can talk

03:00:06.719 --> 03:00:11.839
Caption: internally our mental dialogue this is

03:00:09.519 --> 03:00:13.919
Caption: an example of a computational system as

03:00:11.839 --> 03:00:15.599
Caption: well are you responding to your thoughts

03:00:13.919 --> 03:00:16.879
Caption: appropriately with new thoughts and so

03:00:15.599 --> 03:00:19.519
Caption: forth

03:00:16.879 --> 03:00:21.839
Caption: so again computational awareness of your

03:00:19.519 --> 03:00:23.839
Caption: environment and awareness of yourself

03:00:21.839 --> 03:00:26.160
Caption: self-awareness i think they&#39;re not too

03:00:23.839 --> 03:00:26.160
Caption: hard

03:00:26.399 --> 03:00:30.880
Caption: when it gets more difficult or a bit

03:00:27.839 --> 03:00:32.719
Caption: more difficult is free will

03:00:30.879 --> 03:00:33.759
Caption: okay so everyone says what is free will

03:00:32.719 --> 03:00:36.239
Caption: and whatever and they have all these

03:00:33.759 --> 03:00:38.639
Caption: ideas and we need some soul or spirit to

03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:41.600
Caption: make us be able to make decisions when i

03:00:38.639 --> 03:00:43.199
Caption: come down to it i think it&#39;s pretty easy

03:00:41.599 --> 03:00:45.919
Caption: what is free will

03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:47.040
Caption: free will is making decisions and taking

03:00:45.919 --> 03:00:49.438
Caption: actions

03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:52.319
Caption: based upon your current inputs and your

03:00:49.439 --> 03:00:54.720
Caption: past experience

03:00:52.319 --> 03:00:56.240
Caption: okay what else could it be

03:00:54.719 --> 03:00:57.519
Caption: all right so you&#39;re making a sin you

03:00:56.240 --> 03:00:58.799
Caption: asked me now what do you want for lunch

03:00:57.519 --> 03:01:00.559
Caption: lamb or fish

03:00:58.799 --> 03:01:02.318
Caption: something&#39;s happening in my brain based

03:01:00.559 --> 03:01:04.318
Caption: upon the inputs you gave me and the

03:01:02.319 --> 03:01:06.479
Caption: experience i have some process is going

03:01:04.319 --> 03:01:08.000
Caption: along to actually produce a result i

03:01:06.478 --> 03:01:09.119
Caption: want fish

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:11.359
Caption: okay

03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:13.120
Caption: that&#39;s what free will it&#39;s

03:01:11.359 --> 03:01:15.520
Caption: we&#39;re making again it&#39;s a mechanic

03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:18.160
Caption: mechanical biological machine making a

03:01:15.519 --> 03:01:19.759
Caption: decision nothing fancy there

03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:21.839
Caption: now it does mean somewhat that we&#39;re

03:01:19.759 --> 03:01:23.679
Caption: deterministic which people all don&#39;t

03:01:21.839 --> 03:01:24.959
Caption: feel like i can&#39;t make my own decisions

03:01:23.679 --> 03:01:26.559
Caption: well how do you make your decisions you

03:01:24.959 --> 03:01:28.799
Caption: make them based on current inputs and

03:01:26.559 --> 03:01:30.959
Caption: your past experience what else could you

03:01:28.799 --> 03:01:32.240
Caption: want

03:01:30.959 --> 03:01:33.359
Caption: and don&#39;t worry even though it is

03:01:32.240 --> 03:01:35.200
Caption: deterministic there&#39;s lots of

03:01:33.359 --> 03:01:37.120
Caption: non-linearity in the system lots of

03:01:35.200 --> 03:01:38.399
Caption: noise and quantum indeterminacy you

03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:40.000
Caption: could never predict what someone&#39;s going

03:01:38.399 --> 03:01:42.800
Caption: to say or do

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:44.319
Caption: at that sort of level

03:01:42.799 --> 03:01:45.599
Caption: so free will i think is also not

03:01:44.319 --> 03:01:48.160
Caption: difficult

03:01:45.599 --> 03:01:50.318
Caption: where things get very difficult is when

03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:52.240
Caption: we talk about qualia i don&#39;t know if

03:01:50.319 --> 03:01:54.720
Caption: you&#39;ve heard about qualia but it&#39;s the

03:01:52.240 --> 03:01:58.399
Caption: philosophical content uh philosophical

03:01:54.719 --> 03:02:00.559
Caption: concept of what&#39;s it like to

03:01:58.399 --> 03:02:02.800
Caption: so we can behave consistently with

03:02:00.559 --> 03:02:05.040
Caption: respect to things there&#39;s a certain

03:02:02.799 --> 03:02:07.358
Caption: difference when you feel what it&#39;s like

03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:09.359
Caption: to do something or see something

03:02:07.359 --> 03:02:11.040
Caption: that&#39;s what i want to talk about now

03:02:09.359 --> 03:02:12.959
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk about what&#39;s it like

03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:14.799
Caption: to feel pain

03:02:12.959 --> 03:02:17.359
Caption: what&#39;s it like to see

03:02:14.799 --> 03:02:19.839
Caption: and what&#39;s it like to see red

03:02:17.359 --> 03:02:21.279
Caption: and we&#39;ll try and see no pun intended

03:02:19.839 --> 03:02:22.959
Caption: whether these things relate to the

03:02:21.279 --> 03:02:26.240
Caption: computational approach we&#39;ve looked at

03:02:22.959 --> 03:02:26.240
Caption: for the human mind

03:02:26.399 --> 03:02:29.520
Caption: so this is where we have to ask the

03:02:27.759 --> 03:02:31.040
Caption: audio the controller to please lock the

03:02:29.519 --> 03:02:33.199
Caption: doors we can do some experiment with

03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:35.040
Caption: pain and we ask any are there any

03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:36.399
Caption: volunteers here who want to experience

03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:39.120
Caption: some pain

03:02:36.399 --> 03:02:40.319
Caption: no volunteers so everyone can do it

03:02:39.120 --> 03:02:41.919
Caption: all right

03:02:40.319 --> 03:02:43.279
Caption: so i promise some pain

03:02:41.919 --> 03:02:45.200
Caption: so get ready

03:02:43.279 --> 03:02:46.959
Caption: what i want you to do please get your

03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:48.879
Caption: arms all limbed up get your arms free

03:02:46.959 --> 03:02:51.438
Caption: put your phones down

03:02:48.879 --> 03:02:53.358
Caption: i want you to pinch yourself

03:02:51.439 --> 03:02:55.520
Caption: on your arm somewhere

03:02:53.359 --> 03:02:57.680
Caption: pinch very hard not too hard don&#39;t make

03:02:55.519 --> 03:03:00.478
Caption: some damage but so you can feel it see

03:02:57.679 --> 03:03:02.398
Caption: that word there feel it

03:03:00.478 --> 03:03:04.719
Caption: okay so you pinched your arm

03:03:02.399 --> 03:03:06.880
Caption: what happened then

03:03:04.719 --> 03:03:09.040
Caption: the question is where is the pain you

03:03:06.879 --> 03:03:10.799
Caption: felt something pain but where is the

03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:12.319
Caption: pain and most of time you say oh yeah

03:03:10.799 --> 03:03:13.438
Caption: it&#39;s in my arm i can feel me pinching

03:03:12.319 --> 03:03:15.680
Caption: there

03:03:13.439 --> 03:03:16.960
Caption: but remember what&#39;s happening here

03:03:15.679 --> 03:03:19.040
Caption: all that&#39;s happening is there&#39;s a

03:03:16.959 --> 03:03:21.438
Caption: detector there which is sending an

03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:23.359
Caption: electrical signal up to your brain so

03:03:21.439 --> 03:03:24.640
Caption: when it gets to your brain it&#39;s just a

03:03:23.359 --> 03:03:27.359
Caption: on or off

03:03:24.639 --> 03:03:29.519
Caption: there&#39;s no pain in that signal

03:03:27.359 --> 03:03:31.359
Caption: so where does the pain come from

03:03:29.519 --> 03:03:33.278
Caption: it&#39;s not in your arm

03:03:31.359 --> 03:03:36.319
Caption: the pain is in your mind

03:03:33.279 --> 03:03:37.520
Caption: your mind is constructing this pain

03:03:36.319 --> 03:03:39.600
Caption: for a good reason of course because

03:03:37.519 --> 03:03:41.119
Caption: maybe you&#39;ve got a knife on your arm or

03:03:39.599 --> 03:03:42.398
Caption: you&#39;re pinching too hard or sofa that

03:03:41.120 --> 03:03:46.240
Caption: wants to stop you

03:03:42.399 --> 03:03:46.240
Caption: but you&#39;re feeling this pain

03:03:46.639 --> 03:03:50.799
Caption: so pain is constructed in the mind

03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:51.919
Caption: quite interesting to think about all

03:03:50.799 --> 03:03:52.959
Caption: right another

03:03:51.919 --> 03:03:54.398
Caption: experiment

03:03:52.959 --> 03:03:57.919
Caption: what does it feel like

03:03:54.399 --> 03:03:59.439
Caption: to see red or what does red feel like

03:03:57.919 --> 03:04:01.359
Caption: so the question here is to look at

03:03:59.439 --> 03:04:02.399
Caption: something red

03:04:01.359 --> 03:04:04.880
Caption: i don&#39;t know if you can see something

03:04:02.399 --> 03:04:07.439
Caption: red around anyone got some red on if not

03:04:04.879 --> 03:04:08.959
Caption: we can look at this

03:04:07.439 --> 03:04:11.040
Caption: so look at this red dot and think what

03:04:08.959 --> 03:04:13.200
Caption: does it feels like something to look at

03:04:11.040 --> 03:04:14.639
Caption: red doesn&#39;t it feels like red

03:04:13.200 --> 03:04:16.080
Caption: what does that mean

03:04:14.639 --> 03:04:17.919
Caption: remember what&#39;s happening here it&#39;s just

03:04:16.080 --> 03:04:20.080
Caption: electrical signals in your brain

03:04:17.919 --> 03:04:22.799
Caption: but somehow your brain is constructing

03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:25.200
Caption: this thing that it feels like red

03:04:22.799 --> 03:04:27.200
Caption: this is a big puzzle this is the qualia

03:04:25.200 --> 03:04:29.919
Caption: puzzle what does it mean to feel like or

03:04:27.200 --> 03:04:31.600
Caption: to see red

03:04:29.919 --> 03:04:33.040
Caption: now lots of answers to possible answers

03:04:31.599 --> 03:04:35.040
Caption: to this but

03:04:33.040 --> 03:04:36.160
Caption: another thing here and my hypothesis is

03:04:35.040 --> 03:04:37.520
Caption: when you&#39;re sitting back and you&#39;re

03:04:36.160 --> 03:04:39.359
Caption: looking at red

03:04:37.519 --> 03:04:40.398
Caption: what you&#39;re actually doing is behaving

03:04:39.359 --> 03:04:42.880
Caption: in a way

03:04:40.399 --> 03:04:44.640
Caption: consistent with all the states of

03:04:42.879 --> 03:04:46.000
Caption: different reds and you&#39;re giving that a

03:04:44.639 --> 03:04:48.559
Caption: label doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s light

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:51.599
Caption: red or dark red or this shade of red

03:04:48.559 --> 03:04:53.519
Caption: your semantics are this is red

03:04:51.599 --> 03:04:55.199
Caption: so you&#39;re identifying it as red and

03:04:53.519 --> 03:04:57.358
Caption: you&#39;re saying i&#39;m feeling red when i&#39;m

03:04:55.200 --> 03:04:59.120
Caption: looking at that

03:04:57.359 --> 03:05:00.479
Caption: again it comes to this computational

03:04:59.120 --> 03:05:01.679
Caption: approach to different levels up to

03:05:00.478 --> 03:05:04.000
Caption: semantics it doesn&#39;t matter what the

03:05:01.679 --> 03:05:06.239
Caption: symbol is different types of red the

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:08.399
Caption: semantics it&#39;s red and you&#39;re responding

03:05:06.240 --> 03:05:11.120
Caption: to the fact yes i&#39;m seeing red it&#39;s a

03:05:08.399 --> 03:05:12.720
Caption: red thing and it feels like red

03:05:11.120 --> 03:05:13.919
Caption: not totally convincing that i don&#39;t know

03:05:12.719 --> 03:05:15.759
Caption: if you don&#39;t believe me on that i&#39;m not

03:05:13.919 --> 03:05:16.839
Caption: totally convinced yet but that&#39;s the

03:05:15.759 --> 03:05:19.358
Caption: feeling i

03:05:16.839 --> 03:05:21.679
Caption: have it gets a bit weirder what about

03:05:19.359 --> 03:05:22.959
Caption: black when you close when you um don&#39;t

03:05:21.679 --> 03:05:24.559
Caption: see anything

03:05:22.959 --> 03:05:26.319
Caption: it looks black but why does it look why

03:05:24.559 --> 03:05:28.478
Caption: does it feel black

03:05:26.319 --> 03:05:30.720
Caption: why couldn&#39;t it be white

03:05:28.478 --> 03:05:31.839
Caption: you know what what defines something as

03:05:30.719 --> 03:05:33.120
Caption: white or you say well because there&#39;s

03:05:31.839 --> 03:05:34.000
Caption: lots of light

03:05:33.120 --> 03:05:35.600
Caption: but

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:38.160
Caption: we&#39;re looking at it we see it&#39;s white

03:05:35.599 --> 03:05:39.919
Caption: but what why couldn&#39;t we see it as black

03:05:38.160 --> 03:05:42.160
Caption: it&#39;s almost arbitrary whether you have

03:05:39.919 --> 03:05:44.319
Caption: white or black

03:05:42.160 --> 03:05:45.919
Caption: when we feel it to be white or black but

03:05:44.319 --> 03:05:47.680
Caption: of course we need something to be able

03:05:45.919 --> 03:05:49.438
Caption: to distinguish them so these are what

03:05:47.679 --> 03:05:51.040
Caption: we&#39;ve basically got

03:05:49.439 --> 03:05:52.479
Caption: i think you could swap them around and

03:05:51.040 --> 03:05:54.080
Caption: everything would still work fine it

03:05:52.478 --> 03:05:57.519
Caption: would be a sort of negative color system

03:05:54.080 --> 03:05:57.520
Caption: rather than a positive color system

03:05:57.599 --> 03:06:00.398
Caption: so this brings us to the last little

03:05:59.040 --> 03:06:03.520
Caption: experiment

03:06:00.399 --> 03:06:06.000
Caption: what it feels like to see

03:06:03.519 --> 03:06:08.159
Caption: and this experiment is important

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:09.919
Caption: please close your eyes

03:06:08.160 --> 03:06:11.200
Caption: when closing your eyes and hopefully you

03:06:09.919 --> 03:06:12.959
Caption: can&#39;t see anything it&#39;s pretty dark

03:06:11.200 --> 03:06:15.120
Caption: although i may see some white spots and

03:06:12.959 --> 03:06:16.959
Caption: so forth and at the count of three i

03:06:15.120 --> 03:06:18.080
Caption: want you to open your eyes

03:06:16.959 --> 03:06:18.879
Caption: one

03:06:18.080 --> 03:06:20.879
Caption: two

03:06:18.879 --> 03:06:22.559
Caption: three

03:06:20.879 --> 03:06:24.559
Caption: now you&#39;re seeing here

03:06:22.559 --> 03:06:27.519
Caption: right you&#39;re experiencing you can feel

03:06:24.559 --> 03:06:29.759
Caption: what it looks like to see

03:06:27.519 --> 03:06:32.559
Caption: now the really important point here is

03:06:29.759 --> 03:06:34.559
Caption: your behavior could be consistent with

03:06:32.559 --> 03:06:37.119
Caption: seeing i could notice these microphones

03:06:34.559 --> 03:06:39.519
Caption: here and act appropriately but it&#39;s

03:06:37.120 --> 03:06:41.919
Caption: almost like a step up to say yes i&#39;m

03:06:39.519 --> 03:06:44.318
Caption: behaving consistently but it actually

03:06:41.919 --> 03:06:45.759
Caption: feels like something to see

03:06:44.319 --> 03:06:48.080
Caption: and that&#39;s the tricky point about this

03:06:45.759 --> 03:06:51.040
Caption: quality it feels more like more than

03:06:48.080 --> 03:06:53.120
Caption: just behaving consistently

03:06:51.040 --> 03:06:55.520
Caption: of course when you think about it you go

03:06:53.120 --> 03:06:57.200
Caption: from black to seeing something

03:06:55.519 --> 03:06:58.559
Caption: really you know about

03:06:57.200 --> 03:07:00.000
Caption: what happens in there we ask the

03:06:58.559 --> 03:07:01.199
Caption: question what does it mean to see

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:03.439
Caption: everyone will give you a description of

03:07:01.200 --> 03:07:05.839
Caption: yes we have the the image coming through

03:07:03.439 --> 03:07:07.439
Caption: the up the um the lenses in the eyes

03:07:05.839 --> 03:07:08.959
Caption: it&#39;s sort of inverted it goes into the

03:07:07.439 --> 03:07:10.800
Caption: back of the brain

03:07:08.959 --> 03:07:11.519
Caption: that&#39;s just like the wire coming up your

03:07:10.799 --> 03:07:13.120
Caption: arm

03:07:11.519 --> 03:07:15.119
Caption: it&#39;s not really important

03:07:13.120 --> 03:07:17.040
Caption: because at the end it&#39;s just electrical

03:07:15.120 --> 03:07:18.319
Caption: signals at the back of your brain

03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:20.879
Caption: how does your brain turn those

03:07:18.319 --> 03:07:23.359
Caption: electrical signals into this experience

03:07:20.879 --> 03:07:25.759
Caption: that i feel like i&#39;m seeing things it&#39;s

03:07:23.359 --> 03:07:27.120
Caption: more than just behaving consistently

03:07:25.759 --> 03:07:29.200
Caption: so we have this

03:07:27.120 --> 03:07:31.839
Caption: but how do we get the fact that yes i&#39;m

03:07:29.200 --> 03:07:31.839
Caption: seeing something

03:07:33.040 --> 03:07:36.319
Caption: similarly we can look at bats bats are a

03:07:34.719 --> 03:07:38.080
Caption: bit different of course they don&#39;t look

03:07:36.319 --> 03:07:39.520
Caption: with a normal sight they use

03:07:38.080 --> 03:07:42.080
Caption: echolocation

03:07:39.519 --> 03:07:44.318
Caption: so what&#39;s it like to see as a bat

03:07:42.080 --> 03:07:46.240
Caption: we don&#39;t really know is it like that or

03:07:44.319 --> 03:07:49.120
Caption: do they see it more like we&#39;d guess you

03:07:46.240 --> 03:07:50.799
Caption: know closer things are brighter

03:07:49.120 --> 03:07:52.560
Caption: a different way of perceiving the world

03:07:50.799 --> 03:07:56.398
Caption: what does it feel like to be in batch is

03:07:52.559 --> 03:07:58.000
Caption: a question that philosophers often ask

03:07:56.399 --> 03:07:59.600
Caption: okay the last one here is tricky it&#39;s

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:01.359
Caption: consciousness and i&#39;m running out of

03:07:59.599 --> 03:08:03.119
Caption: time

03:08:01.359 --> 03:08:04.800
Caption: we&#39;ve mentioned all these things so

03:08:03.120 --> 03:08:07.040
Caption: consciousness is often involved with all

03:08:04.799 --> 03:08:09.839
Caption: of these but there&#39;s something more than

03:08:07.040 --> 03:08:11.599
Caption: just behaving consistently

03:08:09.839 --> 03:08:14.959
Caption: people suggest that consciousness could

03:08:11.599 --> 03:08:16.639
Caption: live in the microtubules of the neurons

03:08:14.959 --> 03:08:18.799
Caption: these very small things inside the

03:08:16.639 --> 03:08:20.639
Caption: neurons i think that&#39;s just putting the

03:08:18.799 --> 03:08:22.160
Caption: problem down a level

03:08:20.639 --> 03:08:23.919
Caption: others think that it could be due to

03:08:22.160 --> 03:08:26.319
Caption: with quantum mechanics we need quantum

03:08:23.919 --> 03:08:27.839
Caption: mechanics to be conscious

03:08:26.319 --> 03:08:29.600
Caption: i think that&#39;s just again putting the

03:08:27.839 --> 03:08:31.438
Caption: issue away we know we&#39;re a biological

03:08:29.599 --> 03:08:32.799
Caption: system the consciousness didn&#39;t come in

03:08:31.439 --> 03:08:35.359
Caption: there because of quantum mechanics

03:08:32.799 --> 03:08:36.959
Caption: because it came through evolution

03:08:35.359 --> 03:08:38.640
Caption: and the last one says well maybe the

03:08:36.959 --> 03:08:41.679
Caption: world consists of

03:08:38.639 --> 03:08:43.519
Caption: space and time yes we agree

03:08:41.679 --> 03:08:45.759
Caption: energy and matter yes that&#39;s the

03:08:43.519 --> 03:08:48.398
Caption: universe but now maybe there&#39;s a third

03:08:45.759 --> 03:08:49.919
Caption: thing called consciousness and a lot of

03:08:48.399 --> 03:08:52.160
Caption: physicists now are believing this

03:08:49.919 --> 03:08:54.160
Caption: because they couldn&#39;t see other ways of

03:08:52.160 --> 03:08:55.520
Caption: explaining consciousness

03:08:54.160 --> 03:08:57.120
Caption: but again to me when i look at the

03:08:55.519 --> 03:08:58.799
Caption: evolution of the species i think where

03:08:57.120 --> 03:09:00.799
Caption: did consciousness come in it wasn&#39;t some

03:08:58.799 --> 03:09:02.639
Caption: time that the universe jumped into our

03:09:00.799 --> 03:09:04.160
Caption: head and made us conscious it&#39;s more

03:09:02.639 --> 03:09:07.040
Caption: about the physical architecture and

03:09:04.160 --> 03:09:09.679
Caption: function of the brain

03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:11.040
Caption: so as i put here a computational theory

03:09:09.679 --> 03:09:13.040
Caption: of consciousness basically it&#39;s got to

03:09:11.040 --> 03:09:15.279
Caption: do with self-awareness

03:09:13.040 --> 03:09:17.520
Caption: so you act behave consistently with

03:09:15.279 --> 03:09:19.439
Caption: regards to your states like seeing red

03:09:17.519 --> 03:09:21.278
Caption: or seeing or pain

03:09:19.439 --> 03:09:24.160
Caption: i think you can get most of it out of

03:09:21.279 --> 03:09:26.000
Caption: that but maybe not all

03:09:24.160 --> 03:09:27.520
Caption: the last thing here to look at is how do

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:29.120
Caption: we make robots

03:09:27.519 --> 03:09:31.199
Caption: conscious that&#39;s the whole idea we want

03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:33.839
Caption: to make ai systems we can make

03:09:31.200 --> 03:09:36.000
Caption: computational ai systems but how can we

03:09:33.839 --> 03:09:38.318
Caption: make a robot that actually has

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:40.000
Caption: consciousness now these are robots with

03:09:38.319 --> 03:09:42.479
Caption: cameras like eyes

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:44.000
Caption: they can see and behave consistently but

03:09:42.478 --> 03:09:47.119
Caption: do they actually feel like they&#39;re

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:48.080
Caption: looking as we do

03:09:47.120 --> 03:09:50.240
Caption: um

03:09:48.080 --> 03:09:52.080
Caption: so here&#39;s our robot we can make that

03:09:50.240 --> 03:09:54.080
Caption: robot work well when it turns its

03:09:52.080 --> 03:09:55.359
Caption: cameras on it can avoid the cars and

03:09:54.080 --> 03:09:58.080
Caption: this sort of stuff

03:09:55.359 --> 03:10:00.080
Caption: but will the robot say that actually can

03:09:58.080 --> 03:10:03.200
Caption: feel that it&#39;s seeing things

03:10:00.080 --> 03:10:05.120
Caption: how can we make that actually happen

03:10:03.200 --> 03:10:07.359
Caption: and again i think basically we use this

03:10:05.120 --> 03:10:09.600
Caption: computational theory we design our

03:10:07.359 --> 03:10:12.240
Caption: robots not just to behave consistently

03:10:09.599 --> 03:10:14.559
Caption: with regards to the inputs and so forth

03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:17.040
Caption: but to be a self-aware of the fact that

03:10:14.559 --> 03:10:18.719
Caption: they are seeing they can see red and

03:10:17.040 --> 03:10:21.040
Caption: they can feel pain

03:10:18.719 --> 03:10:22.639
Caption: and then our behavior becomes consistent

03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:25.520
Caption: with us actually feeling like we&#39;re

03:10:22.639 --> 03:10:27.759
Caption: seeing so i say yes i can see i can see

03:10:25.519 --> 03:10:29.039
Caption: things i can feel it

03:10:27.759 --> 03:10:30.559
Caption: so basically again taking the

03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:33.359
Caption: computational approach but i won&#39;t go

03:10:30.559 --> 03:10:35.119
Caption: into that haven&#39;t got time

03:10:33.359 --> 03:10:37.200
Caption: that&#39;s about um all there i&#39;ll leave a

03:10:35.120 --> 03:10:38.399
Caption: second or two for um

03:10:37.200 --> 03:10:40.560
Caption: i&#39;ll just jump through this because i

03:10:38.399 --> 03:10:42.560
Caption: haven&#39;t got time to do that

03:10:40.559 --> 03:10:45.199
Caption: questions just to summarize i didn&#39;t

03:10:42.559 --> 03:10:45.199
Caption: want to do this

03:10:45.599 --> 03:10:49.919
Caption: sorry to summarize what we&#39;re seeing and

03:10:47.919 --> 03:10:52.000
Caption: maybe you agree or don&#39;t agree i&#39;ve

03:10:49.919 --> 03:10:53.759
Caption: explained what a computational system is

03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:55.040
Caption: a system that allows three levels of

03:10:53.759 --> 03:10:57.438
Caption: description

03:10:55.040 --> 03:11:00.799
Caption: have symbols that represent things and

03:10:57.439 --> 03:11:02.880
Caption: maintain semantics under transformations

03:11:00.799 --> 03:11:05.358
Caption: i&#39;ve talked about von neumann computers

03:11:02.879 --> 03:11:07.679
Caption: are discrete computational systems

03:11:05.359 --> 03:11:09.760
Caption: and the brain and connection of systems

03:11:07.679 --> 03:11:12.160
Caption: are more like continuous computational

03:11:09.759 --> 03:11:12.160
Caption: systems

03:11:12.559 --> 03:11:16.239
Caption: i&#39;ve talked that being a computational

03:11:14.240 --> 03:11:17.439
Caption: system allows us to operationalize

03:11:16.240 --> 03:11:20.479
Caption: explain

03:11:17.439 --> 03:11:23.040
Caption: things like awareness self-awareness and

03:11:20.478 --> 03:11:25.599
Caption: possibly qualia and consciousness as

03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:26.879
Caption: this consistent level of behavior

03:11:25.599 --> 03:11:29.199
Caption: but importantly if any of you are

03:11:26.879 --> 03:11:31.279
Caption: working in robotics or ai the real

03:11:29.200 --> 03:11:32.560
Caption: question is how can we make robots truly

03:11:31.279 --> 03:11:34.240
Caption: human-like

03:11:32.559 --> 03:11:37.278
Caption: we&#39;ll need to make them computational

03:11:34.240 --> 03:11:40.959
Caption: systems but also aware self-aware and

03:11:37.279 --> 03:11:40.959
Caption: have feelings and consciousness

03:11:41.200 --> 03:11:44.719
Caption: so we can already already make lots of

03:11:42.959 --> 03:11:46.000
Caption: robots that are very smart and can do

03:11:44.719 --> 03:11:48.239
Caption: things

03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:50.080
Caption: but can we make robots that actually

03:11:48.240 --> 03:11:52.000
Caption: feel pain

03:11:50.080 --> 03:11:53.679
Caption: maybe that&#39;s useful in an evolutionary

03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:55.359
Caption: approach or a programming approach so

03:11:53.679 --> 03:11:58.160
Caption: it&#39;s aware of the fact that it&#39;s got a

03:11:55.359 --> 03:12:00.560
Caption: knife in its leg or something like this

03:11:58.160 --> 03:12:02.879
Caption: can we make robots that can actually see

03:12:00.559 --> 03:12:06.478
Caption: and be aware of seeing not just behave

03:12:02.879 --> 03:12:08.000
Caption: consistently with what it means to see

03:12:06.478 --> 03:12:10.478
Caption: and i had a bit trouble finding an image

03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:12.319
Caption: but can we make robots that are happy

03:12:10.478 --> 03:12:14.079
Caption: and joyful

03:12:12.319 --> 03:12:16.479
Caption: okay not many robot photos show them

03:12:14.080 --> 03:12:20.160
Caption: being happy we haven&#39;t tried to make

03:12:16.478 --> 03:12:20.159
Caption: them feel like they&#39;re happy

03:12:20.240 --> 03:12:24.399
Caption: so all right that&#39;s about all there so i

03:12:21.759 --> 03:12:26.799
Caption: have any questions or quick questions

03:12:24.399 --> 03:12:28.959
Caption: a lot of stuff but uh

03:12:26.799 --> 03:12:30.398
Caption: hopefully it provided some explanation

03:12:28.959 --> 03:12:33.839
Caption: of what it means to see and to be

03:12:30.399 --> 03:12:33.840
Caption: computational yep

03:12:34.879 --> 03:12:39.679
Caption: okay first question

03:12:36.399 --> 03:12:41.120
Caption: uh so just on your first point um

03:12:39.679 --> 03:12:42.559
Caption: you said that

03:12:41.120 --> 03:12:45.040
Caption: you

03:12:42.559 --> 03:12:47.599
Caption: there might be an advantage for having a

03:12:45.040 --> 03:12:50.319
Caption: ai system actually fill consciousness

03:12:47.599 --> 03:12:52.719
Caption: right but is there really any advantage

03:12:50.319 --> 03:12:54.479
Caption: to doing that like

03:12:52.719 --> 03:12:56.879
Caption: very good question very good question is

03:12:54.478 --> 03:12:58.318
Caption: there any advantage to actually feeling

03:12:56.879 --> 03:12:59.839
Caption: something rather than just behaving

03:12:58.319 --> 03:13:01.600
Caption: consistently you know we could if

03:12:59.839 --> 03:13:03.519
Caption: someone puts a knife in our leg we could

03:13:01.599 --> 03:13:05.519
Caption: behave consistently and pull it out and

03:13:03.519 --> 03:13:07.199
Caption: not even be aware of it in fact when

03:13:05.519 --> 03:13:08.879
Caption: you&#39;re sleepwalking

03:13:07.200 --> 03:13:10.000
Caption: people sleepwalk and they do eating and

03:13:08.879 --> 03:13:11.200
Caption: everything when they&#39;re asleep so

03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:13.839
Caption: they&#39;re not conscious but they&#39;re doing

03:13:11.200 --> 03:13:15.520
Caption: all they&#39;re behaving

03:13:13.839 --> 03:13:17.120
Caption: so it&#39;s a really good question i believe

03:13:15.519 --> 03:13:19.679
Caption: there must be some evolutionary

03:13:17.120 --> 03:13:22.080
Caption: advantage to know you&#39;re in in pain

03:13:19.679 --> 03:13:24.080
Caption: maybe even to learn from that experience

03:13:22.080 --> 03:13:25.839
Caption: so it&#39;s not just behaving consistently

03:13:24.080 --> 03:13:27.759
Caption: you&#39;re aware of the fact yes that was

03:13:25.839 --> 03:13:30.799
Caption: pain maybe i can change my behavior and

03:13:27.759 --> 03:13:32.478
Caption: so forth so evolutionary i think why are

03:13:30.799 --> 03:13:35.438
Caption: they here and probably because it makes

03:13:32.478 --> 03:13:39.119
Caption: us a fitter species to survive

03:13:35.439 --> 03:13:40.239
Caption: i think the only difference you&#39;d see is

03:13:39.120 --> 03:13:41.520
Caption: that

03:13:40.239 --> 03:13:43.600
Caption: um

03:13:41.519 --> 03:13:45.919
Caption: the aia system

03:13:43.599 --> 03:13:47.040
Caption: would write a wikipedia page about

03:13:45.919 --> 03:13:48.160
Caption: qualia

03:13:47.040 --> 03:13:49.599
Caption: i think that&#39;s the only difference that

03:13:48.160 --> 03:13:51.359
Caption: would see provided that i didn&#39;t have

03:13:49.599 --> 03:13:53.599
Caption: that could be true but but we have a lot

03:13:51.359 --> 03:13:55.120
Caption: of feelings you know we feel what it&#39;s

03:13:53.599 --> 03:13:58.238
Caption: like to see we feel like it&#39;s what it&#39;s

03:13:55.120 --> 03:13:59.919
Caption: like to be red we feel pain

03:13:58.239 --> 03:14:02.000
Caption: why not if we didn&#39;t feel pain we could

03:13:59.919 --> 03:14:03.438
Caption: just do stuff without feeling it would

03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:05.519
Caption: that be okay i think there&#39;s something

03:14:03.439 --> 03:14:07.040
Caption: to that feeling pain you really learn

03:14:05.519 --> 03:14:09.358
Caption: something from it as i say it&#39;s more

03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:10.799
Caption: like it&#39;s a higher level abstraction

03:14:09.359 --> 03:14:12.959
Caption: doesn&#39;t matter what sort of pain it is

03:14:10.799 --> 03:14:15.679
Caption: we&#39;re just learning to respond to pain

03:14:12.959 --> 03:14:17.040
Caption: but it&#39;s an open question

03:14:15.679 --> 03:14:18.879
Caption: i&#39;m just going to add that we are moving

03:14:17.040 --> 03:14:20.879
Caption: into lunch so

03:14:18.879 --> 03:14:22.559
Caption: we have plenty of time for questions i

03:14:20.879 --> 03:14:24.478
Caption: think i&#39;m going to trespass on dr

03:14:22.559 --> 03:14:26.398
Caption: ashley&#39;s time here and ask you to stay

03:14:24.478 --> 03:14:27.679
Caption: but if you did want to make a move and

03:14:26.399 --> 03:14:30.000
Caption: grab your lunch now you&#39;d be very

03:14:27.679 --> 03:14:32.559
Caption: welcome to do so um i see we have a

03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:32.559
Caption: question here

03:14:33.279 --> 03:14:38.720
Caption: thank you just quickly

03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:41.279
Caption: top down versus bottom up ai and how&#39;s

03:14:38.719 --> 03:14:42.719
Caption: the development going alongside as well

03:14:41.279 --> 03:14:44.800
Caption: as

03:14:42.719 --> 03:14:47.040
Caption: so top down is probably that symbolic

03:14:44.799 --> 03:14:49.599
Caption: approach yes right and i think it

03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:51.599
Caption: suffers from it&#39;s fragile you can write

03:14:49.599 --> 03:14:54.000
Caption: some rules but they don&#39;t actually work

03:14:51.599 --> 03:14:55.519
Caption: in every case so it breaks and doesn&#39;t

03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:57.040
Caption: work properly that&#39;s what we found with

03:14:55.519 --> 03:14:59.199
Caption: expert systems

03:14:57.040 --> 03:15:01.040
Caption: whereas bottom up when things emerge

03:14:59.200 --> 03:15:02.640
Caption: they tend to be more stable and they can

03:15:01.040 --> 03:15:04.879
Caption: handle things which aren&#39;t exactly what

03:15:02.639 --> 03:15:06.478
Caption: you predicted so bottom up is definitely

03:15:04.879 --> 03:15:08.398
Caption: the way to go and we see all the the

03:15:06.478 --> 03:15:10.719
Caption: stuff we&#39;re seeing from abs and in the

03:15:08.399 --> 03:15:12.800
Caption: phones have neural networks now it&#39;s

03:15:10.719 --> 03:15:15.599
Caption: emergent and learning these things

03:15:12.799 --> 03:15:17.519
Caption: what about teaching and artificial

03:15:15.599 --> 03:15:18.839
Caption: intelligence being

03:15:17.519 --> 03:15:21.599
Caption: ethics and

03:15:18.839 --> 03:15:23.519
Caption: morals this where it comes back to i

03:15:21.599 --> 03:15:25.919
Caption: think a bit more about language and

03:15:23.519 --> 03:15:27.919
Caption: words and what do they mean and how what

03:15:25.919 --> 03:15:30.478
Caption: consequences they have you know language

03:15:27.919 --> 03:15:31.919
Caption: is just behavior so i can say i&#39;m moral

03:15:30.478 --> 03:15:33.679
Caption: and i can say it a hundred times doesn&#39;t

03:15:31.919 --> 03:15:35.839
Caption: mean i&#39;m going to behave morally right

03:15:33.679 --> 03:15:37.679
Caption: it doesn&#39;t control our behavior language

03:15:35.839 --> 03:15:40.160
Caption: is just a behavior

03:15:37.679 --> 03:15:41.759
Caption: but the correlationship between that

03:15:40.160 --> 03:15:44.560
Caption: language and the behavior and the

03:15:41.759 --> 03:15:46.000
Caption: consistency between the two sure it but

03:15:44.559 --> 03:15:47.358
Caption: it doesn&#39;t have to exist there are many

03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:48.879
Caption: criminals who think of themselves as

03:15:47.359 --> 03:15:51.760
Caption: good people and honest and they go and

03:15:48.879 --> 03:15:54.000
Caption: commit crimes so so it doesn&#39;t we&#39;re not

03:15:51.759 --> 03:15:56.000
Caption: we&#39;re not driven by our logic we&#39;re

03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:57.519
Caption: driven by the behavior we learn and

03:15:56.000 --> 03:16:00.080
Caption: experience and i missed a section there

03:15:57.519 --> 03:16:02.478
Caption: on describing complex behavior just

03:16:00.080 --> 03:16:05.200
Caption: briefly i believe we actually learn by

03:16:02.478 --> 03:16:07.278
Caption: just seeing patterns and replaying those

03:16:05.200 --> 03:16:10.239
Caption: patterns using very

03:16:07.279 --> 03:16:12.800
Caption: complex hierarchical association engine

03:16:10.239 --> 03:16:15.040
Caption: as i call it so we&#39;re just behaving what

03:16:12.799 --> 03:16:16.398
Caption: we&#39;ve seen and we replay those behaviors

03:16:15.040 --> 03:16:18.479
Caption: over and over and we you know doing

03:16:16.399 --> 03:16:21.120
Caption: anything it&#39;s basically just replaying

03:16:18.478 --> 03:16:22.799
Caption: behaviors in certain contexts

03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:25.040
Caption: so language is that you know i learned

03:16:22.799 --> 03:16:27.040
Caption: to say things and i

03:16:25.040 --> 03:16:28.479
Caption: last question when you&#39;re a diverse

03:16:27.040 --> 03:16:30.239
Caption: individuals

03:16:28.478 --> 03:16:31.839
Caption: well out of my scope there out of my

03:16:30.239 --> 03:16:33.279
Caption: scope we&#39;ve all got different brains

03:16:31.839 --> 03:16:35.120
Caption: with different you know functions in

03:16:33.279 --> 03:16:36.879
Caption: these different areas and uh different

03:16:35.120 --> 03:16:38.719
Caption: abilities to abstract and different

03:16:36.879 --> 03:16:40.559
Caption: learning rates so there&#39;s a wide

03:16:38.719 --> 03:16:44.799
Caption: variation but i would call them all

03:16:40.559 --> 03:16:47.919
Caption: computational systems so

03:16:44.799 --> 03:16:49.519
Caption: i&#39;m sorry hey um really good talk thank

03:16:47.919 --> 03:16:50.719
Caption: you i

03:16:49.519 --> 03:16:52.318
Caption: i agree with you i think there&#39;s

03:16:50.719 --> 03:16:54.160
Caption: probably a lot of scientific benefit to

03:16:52.319 --> 03:16:56.399
Caption: be gained by potentially giving

03:16:54.160 --> 03:16:58.479
Caption: consciousness and certain other sort of

03:16:56.399 --> 03:17:01.279
Caption: like metaphysical abilities for

03:16:58.478 --> 03:17:02.879
Caption: robots to be able to to do

03:17:01.279 --> 03:17:04.879
Caption: but in the scientific community we&#39;re

03:17:02.879 --> 03:17:07.040
Caption: typically bounded by sets of rules of

03:17:04.879 --> 03:17:10.478
Caption: what we not just what we can do but what

03:17:07.040 --> 03:17:11.919
Caption: we should do so how do you feel you know

03:17:10.478 --> 03:17:14.079
Caption: what the ethical

03:17:11.919 --> 03:17:16.478
Caption: implications might be of giving the

03:17:14.080 --> 03:17:19.439
Caption: robot the ability to feel pain yeah it&#39;s

03:17:16.478 --> 03:17:21.278
Caption: a good question it&#39;s a good question

03:17:19.439 --> 03:17:23.439
Caption: if you think of us as just machines

03:17:21.279 --> 03:17:25.040
Caption: experiencing pain

03:17:23.439 --> 03:17:26.880
Caption: we&#39;re just machines experiencing pain

03:17:25.040 --> 03:17:29.759
Caption: robots are just machines experiencing

03:17:26.879 --> 03:17:31.599
Caption: pain we know we&#39;ve made a guess that

03:17:29.759 --> 03:17:33.278
Caption: it&#39;s biologically or evolutionary

03:17:31.599 --> 03:17:35.438
Caption: advantage to feel pain

03:17:33.279 --> 03:17:37.600
Caption: if we give that ability then we put pain

03:17:35.439 --> 03:17:38.640
Caption: on them it&#39;s the same as putting pain on

03:17:37.599 --> 03:17:40.719
Caption: a person

03:17:38.639 --> 03:17:41.519
Caption: so you have to take a consideration of

03:17:40.719 --> 03:17:43.358
Caption: that

03:17:41.519 --> 03:17:45.519
Caption: um because it&#39;s really innate that

03:17:43.359 --> 03:17:46.959
Caption: feeling of pain is so deep and so strong

03:17:45.519 --> 03:17:48.639
Caption: in your system that

03:17:46.959 --> 03:17:50.000
Caption: it&#39;s sort of a part of you so if you

03:17:48.639 --> 03:17:52.318
Caption: make pain or

03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:55.839
Caption: hurt a robot then the same sort of thing

03:17:52.319 --> 03:17:55.840
Caption: so you&#39;d be responsible for it i guess

03:17:56.239 --> 03:17:58.479
Caption: what&#39;s

03:17:57.040 --> 03:18:01.040
Caption: good questions thank you

03:17:58.478 --> 03:18:02.318
Caption: i was wondering what your feedback would

03:18:01.040 --> 03:18:04.719
Caption: be on the

03:18:02.319 --> 03:18:07.439
Caption: call out that the google ai

03:18:04.719 --> 03:18:09.120
Caption: may or may not be sentinel yeah sure

03:18:07.439 --> 03:18:10.399
Caption: what are your thoughts on that so i

03:18:09.120 --> 03:18:12.000
Caption: don&#39;t know anything about the project

03:18:10.399 --> 03:18:13.920
Caption: particularly that one they were talking

03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:16.239
Caption: about but it&#39;s mainly what they&#39;re doing

03:18:13.919 --> 03:18:18.080
Caption: they&#39;re training these systems on large

03:18:16.239 --> 03:18:20.479
Caption: amounts of text

03:18:18.080 --> 03:18:22.560
Caption: to respond with text so they get they

03:18:20.478 --> 03:18:24.079
Caption: learn lots of context which is what i

03:18:22.559 --> 03:18:25.759
Caption: was going to explain in the extra slides

03:18:24.080 --> 03:18:28.399
Caption: there your cortex is basically a

03:18:25.759 --> 03:18:29.519
Caption: hierarchical context engine so it learns

03:18:28.399 --> 03:18:32.319
Caption: if you&#39;re in this context in this

03:18:29.519 --> 03:18:34.398
Caption: context in this state you say this

03:18:32.319 --> 03:18:36.959
Caption: and this is what they did they put lots

03:18:34.399 --> 03:18:38.800
Caption: of training on if you see this sentence

03:18:36.959 --> 03:18:40.639
Caption: you say this sentence and you have huge

03:18:38.799 --> 03:18:42.000
Caption: millions and millions of training but

03:18:40.639 --> 03:18:44.639
Caption: the problem there again is they&#39;re

03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:45.759
Caption: working at that symbolic level

03:18:44.639 --> 03:18:47.839
Caption: all right

03:18:45.759 --> 03:18:50.478
Caption: they&#39;re saving graces they don&#39;t have if

03:18:47.839 --> 03:18:52.398
Caption: then rules there&#39;s statistics between

03:18:50.478 --> 03:18:54.079
Caption: the symbols if you see this symbol then

03:18:52.399 --> 03:18:55.920
Caption: statistically this one&#39;s more likely

03:18:54.080 --> 03:18:57.759
Caption: than this one so they&#39;re sort of halfway

03:18:55.919 --> 03:19:00.000
Caption: between the continuous

03:18:57.759 --> 03:19:02.160
Caption: and the discrete they&#39;re sort of halfway

03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:05.599
Caption: there the symbols are fixed

03:19:02.160 --> 03:19:08.080
Caption: but they&#39;re um rules are sort of

03:19:05.599 --> 03:19:09.679
Caption: continuous and change with learning

03:19:08.080 --> 03:19:12.479
Caption: so

03:19:09.679 --> 03:19:14.398
Caption: whether it&#39;s conscious or not

03:19:12.478 --> 03:19:15.759
Caption: again i guess would come back to

03:19:14.399 --> 03:19:17.520
Caption: consciousness again is different than

03:19:15.759 --> 03:19:19.679
Caption: this being computational i think it

03:19:17.519 --> 03:19:21.679
Caption: would be a computational system it

03:19:19.679 --> 03:19:23.120
Caption: understands when you say

03:19:21.679 --> 03:19:25.519
Caption: it&#39;s raining oh yes i&#39;ll take my

03:19:23.120 --> 03:19:27.839
Caption: umbrella so it&#39;s behaving consistently

03:19:25.519 --> 03:19:30.839
Caption: at the symbolic level so it understands

03:19:27.839 --> 03:19:33.279
Caption: the semantics of raining an

03:19:30.839 --> 03:19:35.120
Caption: umbrella but the issue there and this

03:19:33.279 --> 03:19:37.919
Caption: was just reminding we had an extra slide

03:19:35.120 --> 03:19:40.080
Caption: is that ai system is not grounded and

03:19:37.919 --> 03:19:42.559
Caption: what i mean by grounded is we actually

03:19:40.080 --> 03:19:45.120
Caption: experience rain and see rain it&#39;s just

03:19:42.559 --> 03:19:47.278
Caption: getting text in and text out

03:19:45.120 --> 03:19:49.600
Caption: so it really doesn&#39;t know what rain is

03:19:47.279 --> 03:19:51.839
Caption: it&#39;s just saying what it needs to say to

03:19:49.599 --> 03:19:54.559
Caption: respond correctly to that rain

03:19:51.839 --> 03:19:57.438
Caption: so i think it&#39;s understands rain in its

03:19:54.559 --> 03:19:59.839
Caption: concept of rain defined by its semantics

03:19:57.439 --> 03:20:01.439
Caption: and symbols but it has is not grounded

03:19:59.839 --> 03:20:02.959
Caption: like a real robot would be and can

03:20:01.439 --> 03:20:05.359
Caption: experience rain

03:20:02.959 --> 03:20:07.438
Caption: so i think they&#39;re computational but i

03:20:05.359 --> 03:20:09.919
Caption: wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say they&#39;re

03:20:07.439 --> 03:20:11.760
Caption: aware or self-aware or conscious it&#39;s

03:20:09.919 --> 03:20:14.239
Caption: just this computation the semantics are

03:20:11.759 --> 03:20:16.559
Caption: there because we&#39;ve learned so much but

03:20:14.239 --> 03:20:17.680
Caption: i wouldn&#39;t call it sentient

03:20:16.559 --> 03:20:19.519
Caption: are you comfortable for some more

03:20:17.679 --> 03:20:21.120
Caption: questions happy too people have some

03:20:19.519 --> 03:20:22.719
Caption: questions

03:20:21.120 --> 03:20:25.120
Caption: um with the different levels of um

03:20:22.719 --> 03:20:26.478
Caption: abstraction of um physical functional

03:20:25.120 --> 03:20:28.319
Caption: etc

03:20:26.478 --> 03:20:30.478
Caption: do you think the different levels have

03:20:28.319 --> 03:20:32.720
Caption: any irreducible emotional properties or

03:20:30.478 --> 03:20:34.719
Caption: they&#39;re just useful abstractions in each

03:20:32.719 --> 03:20:36.719
Caption: level

03:20:34.719 --> 03:20:39.519
Caption: um i&#39;m not really sure i don&#39;t have an

03:20:36.719 --> 03:20:41.358
Caption: answer to that um

03:20:39.519 --> 03:20:43.599
Caption: irreducible properties

03:20:41.359 --> 03:20:45.359
Caption: uh now we know the symbolic level needs

03:20:43.599 --> 03:20:48.238
Caption: to represent

03:20:45.359 --> 03:20:50.319
Caption: uh it&#39;s it&#39;s just the abstraction

03:20:48.239 --> 03:20:52.479
Caption: is so important i think that&#39;s the most

03:20:50.319 --> 03:20:55.200
Caption: important aspect of this and i sort of

03:20:52.478 --> 03:20:56.559
Caption: alluded to it you know i had a question

03:20:55.200 --> 03:20:59.040
Caption: i use when i&#39;m trying to explain

03:20:56.559 --> 03:21:01.839
Caption: abstraction to people how useful it is

03:20:59.040 --> 03:21:03.279
Caption: if i told you there are 10 billion atoms

03:21:01.839 --> 03:21:05.679
Caption: here and this is how they&#39;re all

03:21:03.279 --> 03:21:07.839
Caption: configured i gave you the exact location

03:21:05.679 --> 03:21:09.438
Caption: and i said that&#39;s the car i want go and

03:21:07.839 --> 03:21:10.799
Caption: buy it

03:21:09.439 --> 03:21:12.880
Caption: you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell what color

03:21:10.799 --> 03:21:15.040
Caption: the car is let alone what model and what

03:21:12.879 --> 03:21:17.279
Caption: engine so although you have all the

03:21:15.040 --> 03:21:19.120
Caption: detail of the physical system every

03:21:17.279 --> 03:21:20.879
Caption: little specific detail

03:21:19.120 --> 03:21:23.120
Caption: you&#39;re losing what you get at the higher

03:21:20.879 --> 03:21:25.358
Caption: level so ignoring the detail can

03:21:23.120 --> 03:21:27.279
Caption: actually be more useful than the lower

03:21:25.359 --> 03:21:28.720
Caption: level so that&#39;s what we get from the

03:21:27.279 --> 03:21:30.720
Caption: abstractions

03:21:28.719 --> 03:21:32.959
Caption: having that symbolic level says we can

03:21:30.719 --> 03:21:35.200
Caption: ignore the functional states and writing

03:21:32.959 --> 03:21:37.839
Caption: the symbols so we get command

03:21:35.200 --> 03:21:39.839
Caption: consistent semantics is the benefit but

03:21:37.839 --> 03:21:41.358
Caption: i don&#39;t know of any irreducible

03:21:39.839 --> 03:21:43.519
Caption: properties of these different levels

03:21:41.359 --> 03:21:45.279
Caption: particularly so it&#39;s a limitation of

03:21:43.519 --> 03:21:46.478
Caption: like the human mind or the processing as

03:21:45.279 --> 03:21:48.640
Caption: opposed to

03:21:46.478 --> 03:21:50.639
Caption: reality itself it&#39;s

03:21:48.639 --> 03:21:51.599
Caption: yeah it&#39;s a human the human brain is

03:21:50.639 --> 03:21:54.080
Caption: learning

03:21:51.599 --> 03:21:56.478
Caption: symbols and learning semantics and it&#39;s

03:21:54.080 --> 03:21:58.160
Caption: wired at a neural level so that

03:21:56.478 --> 03:22:00.238
Caption: eventually learns something which is

03:21:58.160 --> 03:22:01.759
Caption: consistent and allows us to survive in

03:22:00.239 --> 03:22:03.279
Caption: the world you know you could be

03:22:01.759 --> 03:22:04.799
Caption: programmed wrong so you then come out

03:22:03.279 --> 03:22:06.560
Caption: with wrong semantics and you&#39;re bumping

03:22:04.799 --> 03:22:08.000
Caption: into everything and you can&#39;t talk and

03:22:06.559 --> 03:22:08.879
Caption: get your wife and try to put it on your

03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:10.399
Caption: head

03:22:08.879 --> 03:22:12.398
Caption: that wouldn&#39;t work but luckily our

03:22:10.399 --> 03:22:14.640
Caption: learning tends to end us up with a

03:22:12.399 --> 03:22:16.399
Caption: semantic system that is useful that&#39;s

03:22:14.639 --> 03:22:18.478
Caption: what evolution has given us and that&#39;s

03:22:16.399 --> 03:22:21.760
Caption: what ai is trying to do build systems

03:22:18.478 --> 03:22:24.079
Caption: that learn from experiences and become

03:22:21.759 --> 03:22:24.080

Caption: fantastic

04:20:29.279 --> 04:20:34.479
Caption: so i&#39;m going to dive into some of the

04:20:31.679 --> 04:20:38.559
Caption: questions that are coming up on the

04:20:34.478 --> 04:20:42.158
Caption: panel and the first one that i can see

04:20:38.559 --> 04:20:42.158
Caption: is come on yes

04:20:45.279 --> 04:20:48.239
Caption: it&#39;s okay i&#39;ve got

04:20:47.279 --> 04:20:49.919
Caption: uh

04:20:48.239 --> 04:20:52.879
Caption: an excellent reading voice

04:20:49.919 --> 04:20:55.359
Caption: if you inherit or join a team that is

04:20:52.879 --> 04:20:57.120
Caption: not at all diverse in terms of gender

04:20:55.359 --> 04:20:59.199
Caption: ethnicity etc

04:20:57.120 --> 04:21:01.279
Caption: what can you do to improve that you

04:20:59.199 --> 04:21:02.879
Caption: can&#39;t just fire a bunch of people and

04:21:01.279 --> 04:21:06.640
Caption: replace them

04:21:02.879 --> 04:21:09.839
Caption: so what can you do instead

04:21:06.639 --> 04:21:09.839
Caption: i think perhaps

04:21:09.919 --> 04:21:13.759
Caption: i i&#39;m looking at everybody here i i know

04:21:12.399 --> 04:21:17.279
Caption: we&#39;ve got a few people in leadership

04:21:13.759 --> 04:21:19.519
Caption: positions um louise would you like to

04:21:17.279 --> 04:21:21.359
Caption: to have a think about that one yeah i

04:21:19.519 --> 04:21:24.478
Caption: think it&#39;s actually

04:21:21.359 --> 04:21:27.199
Caption: um really an easy thing to think about

04:21:24.478 --> 04:21:30.478
Caption: we&#39;re all different we&#39;re all diverse

04:21:27.199 --> 04:21:33.600
Caption: anyway even if you even if your team is

04:21:30.478 --> 04:21:35.039
Caption: full of white male middle-aged males

04:21:33.599 --> 04:21:38.080
Caption: every one of them will have a different

04:21:35.040 --> 04:21:40.159
Caption: background different

04:21:38.080 --> 04:21:43.520
Caption: priorities in their lives

04:21:40.159 --> 04:21:46.159
Caption: and you just look for the diversity and

04:21:43.519 --> 04:21:46.158
Caption: you&#39;ll see it

04:21:46.478 --> 04:21:50.639
Caption: yeah that&#39;s a fantastic

04:21:48.399 --> 04:21:53.199
Caption: a fantastic approach thanks louise tina

04:21:50.639 --> 04:21:55.120
Caption: do you have some ideas

04:21:53.199 --> 04:21:57.600
Caption: it&#39;s a it&#39;s a tricky one and when you

04:21:55.120 --> 04:22:00.000
Caption: inherit a team i think um it&#39;s it&#39;s

04:21:57.599 --> 04:22:02.000
Caption: always easier to embed a culture that uh

04:22:00.000 --> 04:22:03.120
Caption: in a team that you um build from scratch

04:22:02.000 --> 04:22:06.080
Caption: but i think

04:22:03.120 --> 04:22:07.679
Caption: setting the intent of having a look

04:22:06.080 --> 04:22:09.120
Caption: around the table i think i agree

04:22:07.679 --> 04:22:10.318
Caption: everyone has a different diverse

04:22:09.120 --> 04:22:12.239
Caption: thinking and

04:22:10.319 --> 04:22:14.640
Caption: acknowledging that but also

04:22:12.239 --> 04:22:15.919
Caption: um acknowledging the perspectives that

04:22:14.639 --> 04:22:18.559
Caption: you might not have around the table at

04:22:15.919 --> 04:22:20.478
Caption: that point you know i think someone&#39;s

04:22:18.559 --> 04:22:22.559
Caption: changed the phrase from culture fit to

04:22:20.478 --> 04:22:24.398
Caption: culture ad and i do really like that

04:22:22.559 --> 04:22:26.079
Caption: sense because culture fit is expecting

04:22:24.399 --> 04:22:27.760
Caption: someone to fit into your organization

04:22:26.080 --> 04:22:29.919
Caption: culture ad is

04:22:27.759 --> 04:22:31.438
Caption: respecting what someone can bring to the

04:22:29.919 --> 04:22:33.279
Caption: table that you might not already have

04:22:31.439 --> 04:22:34.479
Caption: and i think it&#39;s having a look at that

04:22:33.279 --> 04:22:36.159
Caption: especially in technology because you

04:22:34.478 --> 04:22:38.398
Caption: want technology to

04:22:36.159 --> 04:22:41.600
Caption: be fit for purpose for

04:22:38.399 --> 04:22:43.279
Caption: um the demographic multiple demographic

04:22:41.599 --> 04:22:44.839
Caption: you know um that you&#39;re targeting

04:22:43.279 --> 04:22:47.680
Caption: whether that&#39;s your end users or your

04:22:44.839 --> 04:22:49.519
Caption: customers um or businesses so

04:22:47.679 --> 04:22:51.358
Caption: having diverse teams in tech is really

04:22:49.519 --> 04:22:53.599
Caption: important to make sure that tech

04:22:51.359 --> 04:22:55.040
Caption: fits everyone&#39;s needs so

04:22:53.599 --> 04:22:56.559
Caption: you know who haven&#39;t you got at that

04:22:55.040 --> 04:22:57.839
Caption: table who haven&#39;t you got as part of

04:22:56.559 --> 04:23:01.358
Caption: that tech team

04:22:57.839 --> 04:23:02.959
Caption: and make a conscious effort to

04:23:01.359 --> 04:23:04.959
Caption: make sure when you are hiring next that

04:23:02.959 --> 04:23:07.359
Caption: you are actively looking for people that

04:23:04.959 --> 04:23:09.759
Caption: can add to the people you already have i

04:23:07.359 --> 04:23:11.120
Caption: think it&#39;s a longer process because no

04:23:09.759 --> 04:23:12.799
Caption: you can&#39;t fire people and you shouldn&#39;t

04:23:11.120 --> 04:23:15.199
Caption: fire people and because they are

04:23:12.799 --> 04:23:18.080
Caption: obviously there on merit so um i think

04:23:15.199 --> 04:23:19.439
Caption: that that&#39;s really important to um state

04:23:18.080 --> 04:23:21.279
Caption: those values and that intent to make

04:23:19.439 --> 04:23:22.960
Caption: sure you&#39;ve got that diverse pool around

04:23:21.279 --> 04:23:24.640
Caption: the table and

04:23:22.959 --> 04:23:26.159
Caption: it soon becomes clear if you do have

04:23:24.639 --> 04:23:27.919
Caption: people within your team that don&#39;t buy

04:23:26.159 --> 04:23:28.959
Caption: into that concept

04:23:27.919 --> 04:23:32.000
Caption: you&#39;ll find that they&#39;ll often

04:23:28.959 --> 04:23:33.519
Caption: self-select out if they&#39;re not

04:23:32.000 --> 04:23:36.159
Caption: on board with going down that journey as

04:23:33.519 --> 04:23:37.119
Caption: well yeah thanks tina a really important

04:23:36.159 --> 04:23:40.399

Caption: pictures that windows gives us

04:23:58.879 --> 04:24:03.120
Caption: so uh i have a question here if you&#39;re

04:24:01.759 --> 04:24:05.278
Caption: working from home what&#39;s your morning

04:24:03.120 --> 04:24:07.839
Caption: routine and do you use any time

04:24:05.279 --> 04:24:07.839
Caption: management

04:24:08.239 --> 04:24:13.680
Caption: okay so i&#39;ve been working from home like

04:24:10.959 --> 04:24:15.599
Caption: many of us i suppose who are able to um

04:24:13.679 --> 04:24:18.238
Caption: on and off the past couple of years

04:24:15.599 --> 04:24:20.398
Caption: judah covered um also as i mentioned i

04:24:18.239 --> 04:24:22.080
Caption: have two young children so i took leave

04:24:20.399 --> 04:24:23.520
Caption: i had been intending to work from home

04:24:22.080 --> 04:24:25.759
Caption: to some extent

04:24:23.519 --> 04:24:28.478
Caption: and my previous employer bankwest was

04:24:25.759 --> 04:24:30.080
Caption: very very happy to do that so it has

04:24:28.478 --> 04:24:33.039
Caption: been for the past couple of years but it

04:24:30.080 --> 04:24:35.359
Caption: was not an official fully remote role

04:24:33.040 --> 04:24:38.559
Caption: moodle is my first uh

04:24:35.359 --> 04:24:41.279
Caption: pretty much remote like remote first

04:24:38.559 --> 04:24:43.358
Caption: roll um so i suppose i&#39;m still kind of

04:24:41.279 --> 04:24:45.040
Caption: figuring out the routine now that it

04:24:43.359 --> 04:24:47.520
Caption: feels more permanent even though i was

04:24:45.040 --> 04:24:48.719
Caption: effectively remote before

04:24:47.519 --> 04:24:50.398
Caption: um

04:24:48.719 --> 04:24:52.238
Caption: i imagine it changes for everyone but

04:24:50.399 --> 04:24:53.840
Caption: for me personally i end up getting up at

04:24:52.239 --> 04:24:55.520
Caption: about six because that&#39;s when my kids

04:24:53.839 --> 04:24:56.639
Caption: get up

04:24:55.519 --> 04:24:58.799
Caption: so

04:24:56.639 --> 04:25:01.919
Caption: the way that it works for me is we they

04:24:58.799 --> 04:25:03.679
Caption: watch tv we eat some breakfast then my

Caption: and then get started i usually try to

04:25:06.239 --> 04:25:10.959
Caption: get started fairly early so i can finish

04:25:08.399 --> 04:25:12.000
Caption: up early and have a bit more more time

04:25:10.959 --> 04:25:14.478
Caption: with them

04:25:12.000 --> 04:25:16.879
Caption: um my day when i used to commute into

04:25:14.478 --> 04:25:18.398
Caption: the city used to involve a lot more

04:25:16.879 --> 04:25:19.679
Caption: getting dressed and thinking about what

04:25:18.399 --> 04:25:21.840

04:25:32.080 --> 04:25:35.839

04:25:36.959 --> 04:25:39.919
Caption: a little bit

04:25:38.959 --> 04:25:44.399
Caption: um

04:25:39.919 --> 04:25:46.559
Caption: ryan i was hoping to ask you uh about

04:25:44.399 --> 04:25:49.560
Caption: your experiences with inclusive

04:25:46.559 --> 04:25:49.559
Caption: workplaces

04:25:51.919 --> 04:25:56.159
Caption: well i was very fortunate to find a very

04:25:54.000 --> 04:25:58.478
Caption: inclusive workplace um as somewhere with

04:25:56.159 --> 04:26:00.319
Caption: neurodiversity it really comes down to

04:25:58.478 --> 04:26:02.158
Caption: finding a team where they&#39;re willing to

04:26:00.319 --> 04:26:03.120
Caption: take advantage of his strengths and

04:26:02.159 --> 04:26:05.600
Caption: finding a workplace where they&#39;re

04:26:03.120 --> 04:26:07.759
Caption: willing to make accommodations so

04:26:05.599 --> 04:26:08.959
Caption: uh one small one is we have open plan

04:26:07.759 --> 04:26:10.959
Caption: like most

04:26:08.959 --> 04:26:12.559
Caption: uh companies do these days

04:26:10.959 --> 04:26:13.839
Caption: and i can&#39;t concentrate very well if

04:26:12.559 --> 04:26:15.919
Caption: someone&#39;s behind me

04:26:13.839 --> 04:26:17.519
Caption: so i always get the desk at the end of

04:26:15.919 --> 04:26:18.959
Caption: the row and that may seem like a small

04:26:17.519 --> 04:26:20.959
Caption: thing to some people

04:26:18.959 --> 04:26:23.040
Caption: but for me that&#39;s i would be able to

04:26:20.959 --> 04:26:25.438
Caption: concentrate otherwise

04:26:23.040 --> 04:26:26.799
Caption: um i also as i said i have a principal

04:26:25.439 --> 04:26:27.840
Caption: engineer who

04:26:26.799 --> 04:26:30.318
Caption: has a deep understanding of

04:26:27.839 --> 04:26:31.839
Caption: neurodiversity and he knows what some

04:26:30.319 --> 04:26:33.919
Caption: projects to put on and where i can

04:26:31.839 --> 04:26:36.478
Caption: really excel so for example i really

04:26:33.919 --> 04:26:39.279
Caption: excel at depth and complexity

04:26:36.478 --> 04:26:41.599
Caption: thanks ryan that&#39;s a i think fantastic

04:26:39.279 --> 04:26:43.919
Caption: to have that support network in

04:26:41.599 --> 04:26:45.759
Caption: your workplace right that&#39;s a little bit

04:26:43.919 --> 04:26:47.519
Caption: about what what tina was talking about

04:26:45.759 --> 04:26:49.839
Caption: there too

04:26:47.519 --> 04:26:52.398
Caption: the next question is how can you

04:26:49.839 --> 04:26:54.959
Caption: overcome the bias from a team

04:26:52.399 --> 04:26:56.560
Caption: that predominantly works nine to five

04:26:54.959 --> 04:26:58.639
Caption: when you feel like you&#39;re the only one

04:26:56.559 --> 04:26:59.839
Caption: that is working flexibly

04:26:58.639 --> 04:27:02.478
Caption: my goodness

04:26:59.839 --> 04:27:05.358
Caption: uh so do we have some flexible workers

04:27:02.478 --> 04:27:07.438
Caption: on the panel yeah tina teresa do you

04:27:05.359 --> 04:27:10.239
Caption: want to maybe give us

04:27:07.439 --> 04:27:12.159
Caption: some of your thoughts around this

04:27:10.239 --> 04:27:13.919
Caption: uh it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a tricky one i

04:27:12.159 --> 04:27:16.799
Caption: suppose i&#39;ve been lucky enough to work

04:27:13.919 --> 04:27:18.559
Caption: with um managers who have really

04:27:16.799 --> 04:27:20.478
Caption: exemplified this and i feel like that&#39;s

04:27:18.559 --> 04:27:23.040
Caption: that&#39;s really important to be

04:27:20.478 --> 04:27:24.799
Caption: demonstrating that they they have

04:27:23.040 --> 04:27:26.959
Caption: particular boundaries or they need that

04:27:24.799 --> 04:27:28.799
Caption: flexibility and they&#39;re not afraid to

04:27:26.959 --> 04:27:30.639
Caption: say so and it&#39;s really important to have

04:27:28.799 --> 04:27:33.040
Caption: that then example for the team so you

04:27:30.639 --> 04:27:35.679
Caption: can go okay it&#39;s all right for me to

04:27:33.040 --> 04:27:38.080
Caption: step out for a minute to do something

04:27:35.679 --> 04:27:39.839
Caption: or to work in you know a pattern which

04:27:38.080 --> 04:27:41.439
Caption: which makes more sense for me as long as

04:27:39.839 --> 04:27:43.438
Caption: i&#39;m getting my work done i think it

04:27:41.439 --> 04:27:44.960
Caption: requires a lot of um

04:27:43.439 --> 04:27:47.199
Caption: a lot of trust

04:27:44.959 --> 04:27:49.279
Caption: um but uh

04:27:47.199 --> 04:27:51.359
Caption: i find that starting with small steps i

04:27:49.279 --> 04:27:52.080
Caption: suppose if you&#39;re the only person doing

04:27:51.359 --> 04:27:54.399
Caption: it

04:27:52.080 --> 04:27:56.719
Caption: to create that trust to show look sure

04:27:54.399 --> 04:27:58.720
Caption: i&#39;m not working a typical nine to five

04:27:56.719 --> 04:28:00.719
Caption: but i&#39;ve taken this small step the world

04:27:58.719 --> 04:28:02.639
Caption: hasn&#39;t fallen down everything is still

04:28:00.719 --> 04:28:04.000
Caption: getting done and then you can continue

04:28:02.639 --> 04:28:05.519
Caption: taking those steps and then as you&#39;re

04:28:04.000 --> 04:28:07.919
Caption: creating that example then more people

04:28:05.519 --> 04:28:09.519
Caption: will be able to follow yeah yeah i think

04:28:07.919 --> 04:28:11.359
Caption: the example setting is a really good

04:28:09.519 --> 04:28:12.079
Caption: point there teresa it actually reminds

04:28:11.359 --> 04:28:15.600
Caption: me

04:28:12.080 --> 04:28:19.359
Caption: of my current manager who is really

04:28:15.599 --> 04:28:21.438
Caption: vocal about when he&#39;s taking time out

04:28:19.359 --> 04:28:23.600
Caption: to visit the kids or to pick up the kids

04:28:21.439 --> 04:28:25.760
Caption: or to do something else

04:28:23.599 --> 04:28:26.398
Caption: and and that&#39;s an like

04:28:25.759 --> 04:28:29.120
Caption: a

04:28:26.399 --> 04:28:30.880
Caption: value that he portrays to let his team

04:28:29.120 --> 04:28:32.719
Caption: know that it is okay

04:28:30.879 --> 04:28:34.559
Caption: that you have a life

04:28:32.719 --> 04:28:38.159
Caption: yeah

04:28:34.559 --> 04:28:40.799
Caption: uh we have another question here

04:28:38.159 --> 04:28:42.959
Caption: now it feels a little bit similar how

04:28:40.799 --> 04:28:45.358
Caption: can we create a flexible and inclusive

04:28:42.959 --> 04:28:46.879
Caption: work environment for teams in which some

04:28:45.359 --> 04:28:49.040
Caption: team members are required in the office

04:28:46.879 --> 04:28:50.879
Caption: at certain times

04:28:49.040 --> 04:28:53.120
Caption: and others would be able to work from

04:28:50.879 --> 04:28:55.279
Caption: home more flexibly

04:28:53.120 --> 04:28:56.879
Caption: i am i&#39;m looking at louise here actually

04:28:55.279 --> 04:28:59.199
Caption: because we have some

04:28:56.879 --> 04:29:00.159
Caption: you know in-office requirements at our

04:28:59.199 --> 04:29:02.000
Caption: work

04:29:00.159 --> 04:29:05.120
Caption: uh you know what are some of the tools

04:29:02.000 --> 04:29:07.599
Caption: that we use there to manage that yeah we

04:29:05.120 --> 04:29:09.600
Caption: have people that have have to work on

04:29:07.599 --> 04:29:10.879
Caption: site because of the nature of what

04:29:09.599 --> 04:29:13.919
Caption: they&#39;re working on

04:29:10.879 --> 04:29:16.559
Caption: and the information can&#39;t leave the site

04:29:13.919 --> 04:29:18.478
Caption: so they can&#39;t work from home

04:29:16.559 --> 04:29:20.318
Caption: they work in the same team

04:29:18.478 --> 04:29:23.759
Caption: as people who

04:29:20.319 --> 04:29:25.680
Caption: don&#39;t have that restriction at at one or

04:29:23.759 --> 04:29:26.799
Caption: other sort of time

04:29:25.679 --> 04:29:28.158
Caption: so

04:29:26.799 --> 04:29:30.000
Caption: what we do is

04:29:28.159 --> 04:29:31.040
Caption: basically

04:29:30.000 --> 04:29:33.040
Caption: allow

04:29:31.040 --> 04:29:35.439
Caption: flexibility or

04:29:33.040 --> 04:29:37.679
Caption: flexibility at any time

04:29:35.439 --> 04:29:37.680
Caption: and

04:29:37.759 --> 04:29:42.799
Caption: just push the boundary of what we call

04:29:39.919 --> 04:29:44.719
Caption: flexibility basically so

04:29:42.799 --> 04:29:46.398
Caption: you know if they want to if they need to

04:29:44.719 --> 04:29:49.120
Caption: do something during the day

04:29:46.399 --> 04:29:51.359
Caption: they&#39;d go and do whatever

04:29:49.120 --> 04:29:54.479
Caption: if they want to work whatever hours they

04:29:51.359 --> 04:29:55.680
Caption: work whatever hours

04:29:54.478 --> 04:29:56.719
Caption: and

04:29:55.679 --> 04:29:58.478
Caption: if

04:29:56.719 --> 04:30:01.120
Caption: they&#39;ve got an arrangement where they

04:29:58.478 --> 04:30:03.358
Caption: normally work from home on say a

04:30:01.120 --> 04:30:06.080
Caption: wednesday but this week they&#39;re working

04:30:03.359 --> 04:30:07.600
Caption: on classified on information that they

04:30:06.080 --> 04:30:08.719
Caption: can&#39;t take

04:30:07.599 --> 04:30:10.080
Caption: they

04:30:08.719 --> 04:30:13.599
Caption: will

04:30:10.080 --> 04:30:16.399
Caption: just take that day another day

04:30:13.599 --> 04:30:19.278
Caption: if they want so it&#39;s it&#39;s a matter of

04:30:16.399 --> 04:30:20.640
Caption: actually actually being flexible not

04:30:19.279 --> 04:30:23.199
Caption: just

04:30:20.639 --> 04:30:24.559
Caption: using the words and having a policy of

04:30:23.199 --> 04:30:25.600
Caption: being flexible i think there&#39;s a

04:30:24.559 --> 04:30:28.478
Caption: difference

04:30:25.599 --> 04:30:29.759
Caption: between having a policy of flexibility

04:30:28.478 --> 04:30:32.639
Caption: and

04:30:29.759 --> 04:30:34.559
Caption: having contracts that people sign up to

04:30:32.639 --> 04:30:35.839
Caption: to be flexible

04:30:34.559 --> 04:30:37.278
Caption: um

04:30:35.839 --> 04:30:40.719
Caption: yeah absolutely

04:30:37.279 --> 04:30:42.159
Caption: and i like actually being flexible yeah

04:30:40.719 --> 04:30:43.919
Caption: i like another point that you made there

04:30:42.159 --> 04:30:45.919
Caption: as well which was about the the team

04:30:43.919 --> 04:30:48.478
Caption: goal and keeping everybody&#39;s

04:30:45.919 --> 04:30:50.398
Caption: you know everybody is is mindful of what

04:30:48.478 --> 04:30:53.679
Caption: that team goal is

04:30:50.399 --> 04:30:55.199
Caption: uh and as long as you recognize that

04:30:53.679 --> 04:30:58.639
Caption: overall you&#39;re achieving that goal

04:30:55.199 --> 04:31:00.399
Caption: together of somebody is in the in the

04:30:58.639 --> 04:31:02.559
Caption: office when they need to be and and we

04:31:00.399 --> 04:31:05.439
Caption: can manage that together that&#39;s a that&#39;s

04:31:02.559 --> 04:31:07.358
Caption: a really good you know mindset to have

04:31:05.439 --> 04:31:09.279

Caption: from

04:31:59.120 --> 04:32:02.319
Caption: my understanding is what i think the

04:32:00.719 --> 04:32:04.238
Caption: first thing you&#39;d need to look at is

04:32:02.319 --> 04:32:05.760
Caption: what does inclusion look like for you so

04:32:04.239 --> 04:32:07.600
Caption: i think you need to become clearer of

04:32:05.759 --> 04:32:08.559
Caption: like what does that look like for some

04:32:07.599 --> 04:32:10.398
Caption: because otherwise they&#39;ll make

04:32:08.559 --> 04:32:12.318
Caption: assumptions and they might put things in

04:32:10.399 --> 04:32:13.760
Caption: place that are detrimental inclusion for

04:32:12.319 --> 04:32:16.319
Caption: you might be

04:32:13.759 --> 04:32:19.199
Caption: jumping onto a team&#39;s chat um at some

04:32:16.319 --> 04:32:21.600
Caption: point on a friday to um

04:32:19.199 --> 04:32:22.959
Caption: catch up with the team and have a quiz

04:32:21.599 --> 04:32:25.040
Caption: night or something for other people that

04:32:22.959 --> 04:32:28.799
Caption: might be super cringe and you&#39;d hate it

04:32:25.040 --> 04:32:31.359
Caption: so i think being clear about how

04:32:28.799 --> 04:32:32.318
Caption: what how you what are the points that

04:32:31.359 --> 04:32:35.199
Caption: you

04:32:32.319 --> 04:32:38.080
Caption: need to feel included and then go to

04:32:35.199 --> 04:32:40.319
Caption: them and and state what they are like

04:32:38.080 --> 04:32:41.439
Caption: and it may be that it&#39;s a couple of

04:32:40.319 --> 04:32:44.080
Caption: smaller

04:32:41.439 --> 04:32:45.040
Caption: things around um

04:32:44.080 --> 04:32:47.599
Caption: uh

04:32:45.040 --> 04:32:50.239
Caption: being included in certain chats or

04:32:47.599 --> 04:32:51.119
Caption: um asking for information that might be

04:32:50.239 --> 04:32:53.600
Caption: a

04:32:51.120 --> 04:32:55.199
Caption: watercolor conversation to be passed on

04:32:53.599 --> 04:32:57.119
Caption: you know just think of the things that

04:32:55.199 --> 04:32:59.359
Caption: that are important to you

04:32:57.120 --> 04:33:00.879
Caption: and and kind of be clear about what they

04:32:59.359 --> 04:33:03.199
Caption: are i suppose when you&#39;re having those

04:33:00.879 --> 04:33:05.279
Caption: conversations yeah

04:33:03.199 --> 04:33:07.519
Caption: thank you tina

04:33:05.279 --> 04:33:07.519
Caption: uh

04:33:07.759 --> 04:33:13.039
Caption: i love this one is it appropriate

04:33:10.240 --> 04:33:14.480
Caption: for a neurotypical straight white man

04:33:13.039 --> 04:33:16.320
Caption: to be pushing for diversity and

04:33:14.480 --> 04:33:18.878
Caption: inclusivity within a workplace how can

04:33:16.320 --> 04:33:20.560
Caption: we best be allies to the cause

04:33:18.878 --> 04:33:21.439
Caption: love it i love it

04:33:20.560 --> 04:33:22.798
Caption: uh

04:33:21.439 --> 04:33:25.279
Caption: now

04:33:22.798 --> 04:33:28.718
Caption: none of our panelists are like

04:33:25.279 --> 04:33:31.839
Caption: right in that in that area but ryan

04:33:28.718 --> 04:33:31.839
Caption: i am the closest

04:33:33.839 --> 04:33:38.080
Caption: um this is actually a conversation i&#39;ve

04:33:35.919 --> 04:33:41.119
Caption: had a lot and

04:33:38.080 --> 04:33:42.878
Caption: the answer is of course you can um

04:33:41.119 --> 04:33:44.798
Caption: but it&#39;s always good to make room for

04:33:42.878 --> 04:33:47.439
Caption: lived experience voices

04:33:44.798 --> 04:33:48.958
Caption: uh it&#39;s also sometimes important for

04:33:47.439 --> 04:33:49.759
Caption: straight white men

04:33:48.958 --> 04:33:51.759
Caption: to

04:33:49.759 --> 04:33:53.759
Caption: start the conversation because you can

04:33:51.759 --> 04:33:56.400
Caption: end up with a situation where let&#39;s say

04:33:53.759 --> 04:33:58.638
Caption: you want to make your workplace more

04:33:56.400 --> 04:34:00.320
Caption: accepting of disability people where

04:33:58.638 --> 04:34:01.919
Caption: that if people with disability or people

04:34:00.320 --> 04:34:04.080
Caption: with neurodivergence don&#39;t feel

04:34:01.919 --> 04:34:05.679
Caption: comfortable standing up so sometimes you

04:34:04.080 --> 04:34:08.400
Caption: need someone who&#39;s

04:34:05.679 --> 04:34:11.119
Caption: uh for like a better word mainstream

04:34:08.400 --> 04:34:13.359
Caption: um to stand up and

04:34:11.119 --> 04:34:15.279
Caption: be the voice first and once those lived

04:34:13.359 --> 04:34:16.080
Caption: experience voices come in then you can

04:34:15.279 --> 04:34:17.439
Caption: start bringing them into the

04:34:16.080 --> 04:34:19.039
Caption: conversation and start putting them

04:34:17.439 --> 04:34:20.958
Caption: forward if they want to and feel

04:34:19.039 --> 04:34:22.320
Caption: comfortable with it

04:34:20.958 --> 04:34:25.679
Caption: thank you that&#39;s

04:34:22.320 --> 04:34:26.958
Caption: an excellent point and i love how clear

04:34:25.679 --> 04:34:28.958
Caption: you were able to make that point which

04:34:26.958 --> 04:34:29.919
Caption: shows that you are a champion to the

04:34:28.958 --> 04:34:32.480
Caption: cause

04:34:29.919 --> 04:34:34.320
Caption: and a great ally

04:34:32.480 --> 04:34:37.519
Caption: uh the next

04:34:34.320 --> 04:34:39.599
Caption: question oh wow they just changed so you

04:34:37.519 --> 04:34:41.359
Caption: are dynamically choosing what comes up

04:34:39.599 --> 04:34:43.679
Caption: next and we&#39;re probably one or two

04:34:41.359 --> 04:34:45.439
Caption: questions until the end so get those

04:34:43.679 --> 04:34:47.279
Caption: votes in

04:34:45.439 --> 04:34:49.279
Caption: how do you balance the desire or the

04:34:47.279 --> 04:34:50.240
Caption: need for some staff to fully work from

04:34:49.279 --> 04:34:51.199
Caption: home

04:34:50.240 --> 04:34:52.560
Caption: and

04:34:51.199 --> 04:34:55.039
Caption: with the other

04:34:52.560 --> 04:34:57.439
Caption: desire and needs of others for

04:34:55.039 --> 04:34:59.679
Caption: face-to-face interactions particularly

04:34:57.439 --> 04:35:01.919
Caption: for maybe people who feel isolated at

04:34:59.679 --> 04:35:01.919
Caption: home

04:35:02.718 --> 04:35:08.320
Caption: in particular in a single cohesive team

04:35:05.839 --> 04:35:10.480
Caption: now tina you spoke on this just a moment

04:35:08.320 --> 04:35:11.919
Caption: ago i guess in in terms of how to feel

04:35:10.480 --> 04:35:12.958
Caption: included is there anything that you

04:35:11.919 --> 04:35:16.878
Caption: would add

04:35:12.958 --> 04:35:18.638
Caption: um i&#39;d say that um our team are a

04:35:16.878 --> 04:35:21.119
Caption: combination of extroverts and introverts

04:35:18.638 --> 04:35:23.279
Caption: i think so um there&#39;s half of us just

04:35:21.119 --> 04:35:24.958
Caption: love working from home and you know we

04:35:23.279 --> 04:35:26.560
Caption: we get dragged into the office every now

04:35:24.958 --> 04:35:28.240
Caption: and then the other half really missed

04:35:26.560 --> 04:35:30.320
Caption: that connection so i think it&#39;s it&#39;s

04:35:28.240 --> 04:35:32.958
Caption: acknowledging both and again being

04:35:30.320 --> 04:35:35.679
Caption: curious about what each other needs to

04:35:32.958 --> 04:35:37.279
Caption: feel that connection and you know i

04:35:35.679 --> 04:35:39.279
Caption: think a couple of us could go two weeks

04:35:37.279 --> 04:35:41.359
Caption: with working with the odd check-in and

04:35:39.279 --> 04:35:44.320
Caption: still feel motivated where others don&#39;t

04:35:41.359 --> 04:35:47.279
Caption: so we&#39;ve come to the conclusion that um

04:35:44.320 --> 04:35:48.958
Caption: mostly on a monday and uh jeff always on

04:35:47.279 --> 04:35:50.878
Caption: a monday but sometimes on the friday we

04:35:48.958 --> 04:35:52.400
Caption: will all be in the office together and

04:35:50.878 --> 04:35:54.718
Caption: that&#39;s our personal choice and that&#39;s

04:35:52.400 --> 04:35:58.000
Caption: what we discussed and worked for us um

04:35:54.718 --> 04:36:00.718
Caption: as a compromise to have those kind of um

04:35:58.000 --> 04:36:02.560
Caption: uh to uh accommodate for both the

04:36:00.718 --> 04:36:03.599
Caption: extroverts and the introverts across our

04:36:02.560 --> 04:36:05.199
Caption: team

04:36:03.599 --> 04:36:06.320
Caption: yeah love it

04:36:05.199 --> 04:36:07.279
Caption: thank you

04:36:06.320 --> 04:36:09.199
Caption: uh

04:36:07.279 --> 04:36:11.839
Caption: there have recently been experiments

04:36:09.199 --> 04:36:14.160
Caption: around the world of the effectiveness of

04:36:11.839 --> 04:36:15.439
Caption: the four day week

04:36:14.160 --> 04:36:17.759
Caption: oh

04:36:15.439 --> 04:36:21.519
Caption: this is great do we have many people

04:36:17.759 --> 04:36:24.560
Caption: that work part-time with us today

04:36:21.519 --> 04:36:25.439
Caption: yeah a fair few a fair few

04:36:24.560 --> 04:36:27.599
Caption: uh

04:36:25.439 --> 04:36:29.919
Caption: do you see it taking off

04:36:27.599 --> 04:36:31.839
Caption: in perth i might go to tina and then

04:36:29.919 --> 04:36:32.958
Caption: maybe teresa or somebody who does work

04:36:31.839 --> 04:36:34.798
Caption: part-time

04:36:32.958 --> 04:36:36.718
Caption: i&#39;m still on the fence with it because i

04:36:34.798 --> 04:36:38.560
Caption: can see a lot of benefits but also

04:36:36.718 --> 04:36:40.160
Caption: knowing my own personality type i just

04:36:38.560 --> 04:36:43.439
Caption: think i would kill myself in those four

04:36:40.160 --> 04:36:45.199
Caption: days to still get the same stuff done

04:36:43.439 --> 04:36:47.919
Caption: and i&#39;d probably need that day just to

04:36:45.199 --> 04:36:51.519
Caption: recover from the four days that i try to

04:36:47.919 --> 04:36:53.839
Caption: put in so i i don&#39;t know i for me jury&#39;s

04:36:51.519 --> 04:36:55.679
Caption: out still i&#39;d like to see a lot more

04:36:53.839 --> 04:36:59.599
Caption: evidence of how

04:36:55.679 --> 04:37:02.480
Caption: successful in theory and it feels like

04:36:59.599 --> 04:37:04.400
Caption: it&#39;s going to to work and but i can say

04:37:02.480 --> 04:37:06.080
Caption: there may be some potential pitfalls

04:37:04.400 --> 04:37:07.359
Caption: with it so i i&#39;m

04:37:06.080 --> 04:37:09.759
Caption: i&#39;d like to see a few more people

04:37:07.359 --> 04:37:12.080
Caption: experiment with it first before um i

04:37:09.759 --> 04:37:13.359
Caption: commit to the team

04:37:12.080 --> 04:37:15.119
Caption: teresa

04:37:13.359 --> 04:37:17.359
Caption: so i&#39;ve been working four days a week

04:37:15.119 --> 04:37:20.160
Caption: since i started at moodle and i love it

04:37:17.359 --> 04:37:22.160
Caption: working part-time is amazing

04:37:20.160 --> 04:37:24.160
Caption: it was kind of helpful to me in that i

04:37:22.160 --> 04:37:26.638
Caption: started to do that this as i started a

04:37:24.160 --> 04:37:28.798
Caption: new job so i wasn&#39;t taking

04:37:26.638 --> 04:37:30.718
Caption: my five-day workload and attempting to

04:37:28.798 --> 04:37:33.359
Caption: squish it into a four-day workload i was

04:37:30.718 --> 04:37:35.759
Caption: starting with an entirely new one um so

04:37:33.359 --> 04:37:37.599
Caption: for me that that really helped

04:37:35.759 --> 04:37:39.439
Caption: um it&#39;s a little bit different because

04:37:37.599 --> 04:37:41.119
Caption: i&#39;m electing to work four days a week

04:37:39.439 --> 04:37:43.199
Caption: it&#39;s not a you know the four-day work

04:37:41.119 --> 04:37:45.519
Caption: week is the idea that you would be paid

04:37:43.199 --> 04:37:47.519
Caption: your equivalent salary or that&#39;s the

04:37:45.519 --> 04:37:50.080
Caption: main flavor of it i suppose but for that

04:37:47.519 --> 04:37:51.519
Caption: for that four days um and and that is

04:37:50.080 --> 04:37:53.519
Caption: something which i assume would probably

04:37:51.519 --> 04:37:55.759
Caption: need a little bit more experimentation

04:37:53.519 --> 04:37:58.718
Caption: and a bit more more proof to really

04:37:55.759 --> 04:38:00.400
Caption: become more mainstream as tina said yeah

04:37:58.718 --> 04:38:02.798
Caption: awesome

04:38:00.400 --> 04:38:02.798
Caption: thank you

04:38:02.878 --> 04:38:07.599
Caption: the next question is that i find it

04:38:05.519 --> 04:38:09.359
Caption: frustrating when leaders come back from

04:38:07.599 --> 04:38:11.679
Caption: parental leave and they want to work

04:38:09.359 --> 04:38:14.080
Caption: part-time only to be told that the role

04:38:11.679 --> 04:38:15.599
Caption: isn&#39;t available in this capacity is this

04:38:14.080 --> 04:38:16.560
Caption: outdated thinking

04:38:15.599 --> 04:38:19.279
Caption: or

04:38:16.560 --> 04:38:21.679
Caption: can should the business be more flexible

04:38:19.279 --> 04:38:23.679
Caption: with leadership roles so we have five

04:38:21.679 --> 04:38:26.320
Caption: minutes left

04:38:23.679 --> 04:38:28.080
Caption: and this is this is a good one so uh we

04:38:26.320 --> 04:38:30.240
Caption: have a couple of parents up on the panel

04:38:28.080 --> 04:38:32.878
Caption: and tina you have just come back from

04:38:30.240 --> 04:38:34.638
Caption: parental leave i have so i have a

04:38:32.878 --> 04:38:36.160
Caption: three-year-old who&#39;s in the wonderful

04:38:34.638 --> 04:38:37.439
Caption: child care that ddd put on thank you

04:38:36.160 --> 04:38:39.839
Caption: very much for that and i have a five

04:38:37.439 --> 04:38:42.560
Caption: week old which is that who&#39;s at home

04:38:39.839 --> 04:38:44.320
Caption: um with his dad and

04:38:42.560 --> 04:38:46.718
Caption: i think that that is such an outdated

04:38:44.320 --> 04:38:48.560
Caption: concept like completely outdated so i

04:38:46.718 --> 04:38:50.080
Caption: went to put my hand up when i work to

04:38:48.560 --> 04:38:52.160
Caption: say i work part-time but i&#39;m technically

04:38:50.080 --> 04:38:54.160
Caption: still on parental leave so i&#39;m not sure

04:38:52.160 --> 04:38:55.439
Caption: how that looks when i get back yet but

04:38:54.160 --> 04:38:58.240
Caption: um for me i&#39;m a leader of two

04:38:55.439 --> 04:39:00.080
Caption: organizations so i lead valrose as a ceo

04:38:58.240 --> 04:39:04.400
Caption: and i lead women in technology wa as a

04:39:00.080 --> 04:39:06.480
Caption: co-chair um they both take up my time um

04:39:04.400 --> 04:39:08.878
Caption: i put in a lot of hours but i think to

04:39:06.480 --> 04:39:11.199
Caption: say that you can&#39;t come back as a leader

04:39:08.878 --> 04:39:13.119
Caption: flexibly is i think you&#39;re thinking more

04:39:11.199 --> 04:39:15.359
Caption: of a manager than a leader i think if

04:39:13.119 --> 04:39:17.119
Caption: you&#39;re a senior leader um it&#39;s a perfect

04:39:15.359 --> 04:39:19.279
Caption: opportunity to come back as flexibly

04:39:17.119 --> 04:39:20.638
Caption: because it&#39;s about being the driver of

04:39:19.279 --> 04:39:23.039
Caption: the culture it&#39;s about setting the

04:39:20.638 --> 04:39:25.679
Caption: strategy it&#39;s about trusting your team

04:39:23.039 --> 04:39:27.039
Caption: to to kind of execute and do and yeah

04:39:25.679 --> 04:39:29.439
Caption: you may need to get in and get in and

04:39:27.039 --> 04:39:30.160
Caption: get your hands dirty but if you can&#39;t

04:39:29.439 --> 04:39:32.480
Caption: like

04:39:30.160 --> 04:39:34.320
Caption: you know i just think that it&#39;s it&#39;s an

04:39:32.480 --> 04:39:37.039
Caption: ideal role sometimes to be able to do

04:39:34.320 --> 04:39:39.759
Caption: that and yes it can be high pressure um

04:39:37.039 --> 04:39:41.759
Caption: but yeah you should at that stage have

04:39:39.759 --> 04:39:43.199
Caption: really got a lot more comfortable with

04:39:41.759 --> 04:39:45.439
Caption: setting your boundaries with with

04:39:43.199 --> 04:39:47.119
Caption: managing your time and being able to do

04:39:45.439 --> 04:39:49.839
Caption: that so i think it&#39;s an absolutely

04:39:47.119 --> 04:39:51.839
Caption: outdated role uh outdated concept sorry

04:39:49.839 --> 04:39:54.080
Caption: not about table

04:39:51.839 --> 04:39:56.638

Caption: people who would like to have a go at

04:39:56.638 --> 04:40:00.718
Caption: that question overall or shall i move on

04:40:01.439 --> 04:40:04.716
Caption: okay

04:40:02.400 --> 04:40:05.599
Caption: so our final question today

04:40:04.718 --> 04:40:07.521
Caption: is

04:40:05.599 --> 04:40:09.759
Caption: how can remote teams build strong

04:40:07.519 --> 04:40:12.636
Caption: relationships with one another

04:40:09.759 --> 04:40:14.560
Caption: uh ryan do you have uh

04:40:12.638 --> 04:40:18.320
Caption: some remote people in your team

04:40:14.560 --> 04:40:18.320
Caption: currently unofficially yes

04:40:18.638 --> 04:40:22.560

04:40:20.718 --> 04:40:25.361
Caption: really don&#39;t like being in the office

04:40:22.560 --> 04:40:25.361
Caption: the main way

04:40:26.160 --> 04:40:31.199
Caption: the main way i i see doing it is

04:40:29.359 --> 04:40:33.199
Caption: it&#39;s good to have a for lack of a better

04:40:31.199 --> 04:40:34.876
Caption: word meme culture and teams

04:40:33.199 --> 04:40:36.716
Caption: the other thing is you don&#39;t need to be

04:40:34.878 --> 04:40:38.000
Caption: in person to have coffee

04:40:36.718 --> 04:40:42.160
Caption: um

04:40:38.000 --> 04:40:43.119
Caption: so and also if you can get the habit of

04:40:42.160 --> 04:40:44.798
Caption: trying to get to the point where you&#39;re

04:40:43.119 --> 04:40:47.359
Caption: comfortable jerking around and battering

04:40:44.798 --> 04:40:49.761

Caption: so

04:40:53.599 --> 04:40:58.480
Caption: we do have time for one more question

04:40:56.638 --> 04:41:00.000
Caption: and i am just live updating because at

04:40:58.480 --> 04:41:03.361
Caption: the moment the questions are like my

04:41:00.000 --> 04:41:06.160
Caption: questions which is fine um

04:41:03.359 --> 04:41:08.558
Caption: the the next one that i will ask then is

04:41:06.160 --> 04:41:10.878
Caption: is flexible working constrained to time

04:41:08.560 --> 04:41:14.320
Caption: or place and how else can workplaces be

04:41:10.878 --> 04:41:15.921
Caption: flexible now louise

04:41:14.320 --> 04:41:18.638
Caption: i&#39;m gonna pick on you here because we

04:41:15.919 --> 04:41:20.480
Caption: have quite a you know robust flexible

04:41:18.638 --> 04:41:22.958
Caption: working policy and people that do a lot

04:41:20.480 --> 04:41:25.839
Caption: of different things so i i know that

04:41:22.957 --> 04:41:29.839
Caption: you&#39;ve got some thoughts on how that can

04:41:25.839 --> 04:41:33.439
Caption: work yeah yeah so where we do we have a

04:41:29.839 --> 04:41:35.599
Caption: yes a big big policy and it&#39;s too big

04:41:33.439 --> 04:41:37.119
Caption: too many pages to read

04:41:35.599 --> 04:41:39.679
Caption: and you can have

04:41:37.119 --> 04:41:40.716
Caption: telus flex

04:41:39.679 --> 04:41:43.119

Caption: but

04:41:48.400 --> 04:41:54.080
Caption: i think it&#39;s a matter of thinking about

04:41:50.957 --> 04:41:55.919
Caption: what it is that makes people

04:41:54.080 --> 04:41:56.878

04:41:56.878 --> 04:42:02.160
Caption: ensuring that that they get to that

04:41:59.199 --> 04:42:04.080
Caption: chance to to do that so

04:42:02.160 --> 04:42:07.599
Caption: using

04:42:04.080 --> 04:42:10.320
Caption: using your policy to to

04:42:07.599 --> 04:42:11.439

04:42:10.320 --> 04:42:14.878
Caption: um

04:42:11.439 --> 04:42:17.919

Caption: um

04:55:03.759 --> 04:55:07.519
Caption: so i&#39;m going to be talking today about

04:55:06.080 --> 04:55:09.439
Caption: best practice

04:55:07.519 --> 04:55:11.839
Caption: and why we should ban it from our

04:55:09.439 --> 04:55:14.636
Caption: vocabulary

04:55:11.839 --> 04:55:14.638
Caption: no excuses

04:55:15.039 --> 04:55:20.000
Caption: so first of all what is best practice

04:55:17.519 --> 04:55:21.679
Caption: best practice is

04:55:20.000 --> 04:55:22.638
Caption: defining a couple of ways so the

04:55:21.679 --> 04:55:24.636
Caption: definite

04:55:22.638 --> 04:55:27.121
Caption: dictionary definition

04:55:24.638 --> 04:55:28.400
Caption: is really around

04:55:27.119 --> 04:55:29.919
Caption: research

04:55:28.400 --> 04:55:31.839
Caption: and

04:55:29.919 --> 04:55:34.160
Caption: replicable um

04:55:31.839 --> 04:55:35.039
Caption: replication of it basically

04:55:34.160 --> 04:55:37.439
Caption: um

04:55:35.039 --> 04:55:39.439
Caption: a second definition i found was

04:55:37.439 --> 04:55:40.400
Caption: essentially following the same the same

04:55:39.439 --> 04:55:42.716
Caption: theme

04:55:40.400 --> 04:55:44.240
Caption: around replication

04:55:42.718 --> 04:55:45.919
Caption: research

04:55:44.240 --> 04:55:47.121
Caption: and

04:55:45.919 --> 04:55:48.080
Caption: really just

04:55:47.119 --> 04:55:50.716
Caption: really going through the different

04:55:48.080 --> 04:55:52.080
Caption: options and finding out what is best

04:55:50.718 --> 04:55:54.638
Caption: however

04:55:52.080 --> 04:55:55.599
Caption: that is often not what people

04:55:54.638 --> 04:55:59.041
Caption: mean

04:55:55.599 --> 04:55:59.039
Caption: when they talk about best practice

04:55:59.119 --> 04:56:02.796
Caption: so first of all i&#39;m going to say that

04:56:00.878 --> 04:56:04.560
Caption: again i am a consultant

04:56:02.798 --> 04:56:06.841
Caption: i work across a range of different

04:56:04.560 --> 04:56:10.000
Caption: industries different clients different

04:56:06.839 --> 04:56:12.080
Caption: teams and across the board

04:56:10.000 --> 04:56:13.199
Caption: everyone&#39;s doing things differently

04:56:12.080 --> 04:56:14.480
Caption: everyone thinks they&#39;re doing best

04:56:13.199 --> 04:56:16.318
Caption: practice

04:56:14.480 --> 04:56:18.240
Caption: everyone&#39;s doing it differently so that

04:56:16.320 --> 04:56:20.080
Caption: should say one thing in and of itself

04:56:18.240 --> 04:56:22.560
Caption: that everyone thinks best practice or

04:56:20.080 --> 04:56:24.560
Caption: what&#39;s best practice to their problem

04:56:22.560 --> 04:56:26.480
Caption: is different

04:56:24.560 --> 04:56:28.400
Caption: so what do people really mean when they

04:56:26.480 --> 04:56:30.000
Caption: say best practice and i&#39;m sure some

04:56:28.400 --> 04:56:31.599
Caption: people will recognize

04:56:30.000 --> 04:56:33.599
Caption: what they really mean in a few of their

04:56:31.599 --> 04:56:34.796
Caption: conversations but a lot of the time

04:56:33.599 --> 04:56:36.796
Caption: people are saying

04:56:34.798 --> 04:56:39.761
Caption: in conversations when they&#39;re deciding

04:56:36.798 --> 04:56:41.201
Caption: what uh what solutions to go for

04:56:39.759 --> 04:56:43.599
Caption: they&#39;re really just saying well this is

04:56:41.199 --> 04:56:44.796
Caption: what i know so therefore this is what we

04:56:43.599 --> 04:56:45.759
Caption: should do

04:56:44.798 --> 04:56:46.878
Caption: or

04:56:45.759 --> 04:56:48.876
Caption: well somebody else did it this way

04:56:46.878 --> 04:56:52.718
Caption: therefore we should do it this way

04:56:48.878 --> 04:56:54.878
Caption: but it doesn&#39;t really capture a lot of

04:56:52.718 --> 04:56:56.718
Caption: the intricacies that we face when we

04:56:54.878 --> 04:57:00.638
Caption: deal within deal with a project within a

04:56:56.718 --> 04:57:02.240
Caption: company so what organization a did

04:57:00.638 --> 04:57:05.400
Caption: isn&#39;t necessarily what organization b

04:57:02.240 --> 04:57:05.400
Caption: should do

04:57:05.599 --> 04:57:09.839
Caption: so when we talk about best practice it

04:57:08.240 --> 04:57:12.240
Caption: doesn&#39;t actually give any real

04:57:09.839 --> 04:57:14.160
Caption: information we&#39;re not saying that

04:57:12.240 --> 04:57:15.679
Caption: this option is better because of x y and

04:57:14.160 --> 04:57:17.199
Caption: z we&#39;re simply saying it&#39;s better

04:57:15.679 --> 04:57:20.160
Caption: because it&#39;s best practice

04:57:17.199 --> 04:57:22.318
Caption: and you can&#39;t really argue with that

04:57:20.160 --> 04:57:22.320
Caption: so

04:57:22.560 --> 04:57:27.201
Caption: to elaborate on that a little bit

04:57:24.798 --> 04:57:28.560
Caption: when people talk about best practice

04:57:27.199 --> 04:57:30.876
Caption: they

04:57:28.560 --> 04:57:33.759
Caption: really are using it often as a shield in

04:57:30.878 --> 04:57:36.718
Caption: these in these conversations so kind of

04:57:33.759 --> 04:57:38.480
Caption: going well this is what i know therefore

04:57:36.718 --> 04:57:39.601
Caption: i&#39;ll say it&#39;s best practice

04:57:38.480 --> 04:57:40.798
Caption: and then

04:57:39.599 --> 04:57:42.560
Caption: they can&#39;t really argue with me because

04:57:40.798 --> 04:57:43.761
Caption: how can you argue against best practice

04:57:42.560 --> 04:57:45.441
Caption: it&#39;s best practice that&#39;s why it&#39;s

04:57:43.759 --> 04:57:48.638
Caption: called best practice and that is a

04:57:45.439 --> 04:57:48.636
Caption: genuine conversation i&#39;ve had

04:57:48.878 --> 04:57:51.041
Caption: so

04:57:51.119 --> 04:57:54.796
Caption: people will also use this

04:57:53.279 --> 04:57:57.599
Caption: as

04:57:54.798 --> 04:57:57.601
Caption: a way to

04:57:57.730 --> 04:58:01.201
Caption: [Music]

04:57:58.839 --> 04:58:02.638
Caption: um also use it as a bit of a shield when

04:58:01.199 --> 04:58:05.199
Caption: they don&#39;t really understand what it is

04:58:02.638 --> 04:58:06.878
Caption: that they&#39;re trying to do as well so

04:58:05.199 --> 04:58:08.160
Caption: people who

04:58:06.878 --> 04:58:09.841
Caption: for example trying to set up a data

04:58:08.160 --> 04:58:12.718
Caption: warehouse they know they want a data

04:58:09.839 --> 04:58:14.876
Caption: warehouse they don&#39;t really know

04:58:12.718 --> 04:58:16.638
Caption: what it needs to do and who it needs to

04:58:14.878 --> 04:58:18.240
Caption: be used for so they start throwing

04:58:16.638 --> 04:58:20.240
Caption: around things like best practice and

04:58:18.240 --> 04:58:22.000
Caption: they&#39;ll go well we need a kimbel star

04:58:20.240 --> 04:58:23.519
Caption: schema because it&#39;s best practice and

04:58:22.000 --> 04:58:25.119
Caption: it&#39;s like is that really going to meet

04:58:23.519 --> 04:58:27.199
Caption: our requirements is that really going to

04:58:25.119 --> 04:58:29.519
Caption: be useful for the end users like what

04:58:27.199 --> 04:58:31.359
Caption: are we actually trying to do

04:58:29.519 --> 04:58:33.759
Caption: second of all it gets often used to

04:58:31.359 --> 04:58:35.839
Caption: promote things people

04:58:33.759 --> 04:58:38.160
Caption: teams organizations they often want to

04:58:35.839 --> 04:58:40.240
Caption: say yeah i&#39;m doing best practice it&#39;s

04:58:38.160 --> 04:58:41.759
Caption: almost a badge of honor

04:58:40.240 --> 04:58:42.798
Caption: to kind of say well we&#39;re doing better

04:58:41.759 --> 04:58:44.796
Caption: than you

04:58:42.798 --> 04:58:46.320
Caption: but as i mentioned at the start

04:58:44.798 --> 04:58:48.000
Caption: different organizations have different

04:58:46.320 --> 04:58:49.679
Caption: problems different solutions everyone&#39;s

04:58:48.000 --> 04:58:50.878
Caption: doing things differently

04:58:49.679 --> 04:58:52.160
Caption: you know

04:58:50.878 --> 04:58:54.000
Caption: they&#39;re not necessarily saying someone

04:58:52.160 --> 04:58:56.400
Caption: doing it good someone doing it bad it&#39;s

04:58:54.000 --> 04:58:58.000
Caption: different because the environment is

04:58:56.400 --> 04:58:59.121
Caption: different the people are different the

04:58:58.000 --> 04:59:00.480
Caption: organization&#39;s different the problems

04:58:59.119 --> 04:59:02.716
Caption: are different the it infrastructure is

04:59:00.480 --> 04:59:02.718
Caption: different

04:59:02.798 --> 04:59:06.560
Caption: and finally

04:59:04.638 --> 04:59:08.480
Caption: some people especially in the leadership

04:59:06.560 --> 04:59:09.599
Caption: role will often use the term best

04:59:08.480 --> 04:59:11.441
Caption: practice

04:59:09.599 --> 04:59:12.796
Caption: to kind of escape some of the

04:59:11.439 --> 04:59:14.400
Caption: responsibility

04:59:12.798 --> 04:59:16.320
Caption: so they&#39;ll go oh we need a data

04:59:14.400 --> 04:59:18.320
Caption: warehouse

04:59:16.320 --> 04:59:20.000
Caption: they don&#39;t want to make decisions around

04:59:18.320 --> 04:59:21.121
Caption: well what are we going to implement what

04:59:20.000 --> 04:59:22.240
Caption: infrastructure we&#39;re going to use

04:59:21.119 --> 04:59:25.439
Caption: they&#39;re going to say well we&#39;re going to

04:59:22.240 --> 04:59:28.000
Caption: implement best practice and

04:59:25.439 --> 04:59:29.599
Caption: that really just erodes some of this

04:59:28.000 --> 04:59:31.199
Caption: that the team

04:59:29.599 --> 04:59:32.560
Caption: sort of make up you&#39;re not listening to

04:59:31.199 --> 04:59:34.716
Caption: different ideas

04:59:32.560 --> 04:59:36.718
Caption: and it&#39;s really taking away their

04:59:34.718 --> 04:59:38.080
Caption: responsibility for the decision

04:59:36.718 --> 04:59:40.000
Caption: you know if something goes wrong they go

04:59:38.080 --> 04:59:43.839
Caption: well it was best practice you know it&#39;s

04:59:40.000 --> 04:59:43.839
Caption: not my problem it&#39;s best practice

04:59:43.919 --> 04:59:47.359
Caption: so

04:59:45.759 --> 04:59:49.439
Caption: what are these problems really what is

04:59:47.359 --> 04:59:51.679
Caption: this actually causing problems with our

04:59:49.439 --> 04:59:53.599
Caption: projects first and foremost

04:59:51.679 --> 04:59:55.599
Caption: it&#39;s really ignoring different

04:59:53.599 --> 04:59:57.759
Caption: ideas that are being put forward if you

04:59:55.599 --> 04:59:58.876
Caption: put forward something a different idea

04:59:57.759 --> 05:00:00.480
Caption: people are often shooting it down

04:59:58.878 --> 05:00:02.400
Caption: because it&#39;s not best practice or they

05:00:00.480 --> 05:00:04.240
Caption: don&#39;t deem it to be best practice

05:00:02.400 --> 05:00:06.080
Caption: again i&#39;m hoping the theme here is that

05:00:04.240 --> 05:00:06.878
Caption: there&#39;s no such thing as best practice

05:00:06.080 --> 05:00:08.080
Caption: but

05:00:06.878 --> 05:00:09.921
Caption: a lot of people

05:00:08.080 --> 05:00:11.199
Caption: will discount things simply because they

05:00:09.919 --> 05:00:14.480
Caption: don&#39;t know it therefore it&#39;s not best

05:00:11.199 --> 05:00:14.478
Caption: practice therefore we shouldn&#39;t do it

05:00:14.638 --> 05:00:18.560
Caption: with promoting

05:00:16.718 --> 05:00:19.601
Caption: it often breeds a very toxic work

05:00:18.560 --> 05:00:22.560
Caption: culture

05:00:19.599 --> 05:00:24.560
Caption: where people&#39;s ideas are not shared and

05:00:22.560 --> 05:00:25.599
Caption: valued it&#39;s very much about promoting

05:00:24.560 --> 05:00:26.798
Caption: while we&#39;re doing best practice

05:00:25.599 --> 05:00:28.160
Caption: therefore we&#39;re better therefore you

05:00:26.798 --> 05:00:30.000
Caption: should listen to us

05:00:28.160 --> 05:00:32.878
Caption: and i&#39;ve worked across many teams where

05:00:30.000 --> 05:00:34.718
Caption: this has actually occurred

05:00:32.878 --> 05:00:36.638
Caption: and finally

05:00:34.718 --> 05:00:38.560
Caption: avoiding this responsibility

05:00:36.638 --> 05:00:40.400
Caption: really does create a lack of leadership

05:00:38.560 --> 05:00:43.041
Caption: within the

05:00:40.400 --> 05:00:46.560
Caption: the the project team and even within the

05:00:43.039 --> 05:00:46.558
Caption: wider team of stakeholders

05:00:46.878 --> 05:00:50.080
Caption: so

05:00:48.878 --> 05:00:52.160
Caption: overall

05:00:50.080 --> 05:00:53.199
Caption: trying to take the concept of best

05:00:52.160 --> 05:00:55.599
Caption: practice

05:00:53.199 --> 05:00:58.000
Caption: is really removing that

05:00:55.599 --> 05:01:00.160
Caption: visibility and understanding of on the

05:00:58.000 --> 05:01:01.359
Caption: ability to be able to articulate some of

05:01:00.160 --> 05:01:02.958
Caption: these

05:01:01.359 --> 05:01:04.320
Caption: these concepts and the reasons why we

05:01:02.957 --> 05:01:05.919
Caption: should be doing something

05:01:04.320 --> 05:01:07.201
Caption: you know we shouldn&#39;t be doing something

05:01:05.919 --> 05:01:09.119
Caption: because it&#39;s best practice we should be

05:01:07.199 --> 05:01:10.716
Caption: doing something because it solves a to

05:01:09.119 --> 05:01:13.359
Caption: constraints b

05:01:10.718 --> 05:01:13.361
Caption: for user c

05:01:13.759 --> 05:01:17.599
Caption: so

05:01:15.119 --> 05:01:19.279
Caption: the ability to articulate solutions

05:01:17.599 --> 05:01:20.957
Caption: does create a few

05:01:19.279 --> 05:01:22.478
Caption: bit extra benefits

05:01:20.957 --> 05:01:23.599
Caption: that

05:01:22.480 --> 05:01:25.201
Caption: you can&#39;t really get when you start

05:01:23.599 --> 05:01:27.759
Caption: talking about best practice

05:01:25.199 --> 05:01:30.558
Caption: first one is building trust you start

05:01:27.759 --> 05:01:32.000
Caption: building trust with people when

05:01:30.560 --> 05:01:33.441
Caption: uh so take for example if you start

05:01:32.000 --> 05:01:34.240
Caption: talking about best practice

05:01:33.439 --> 05:01:36.957
Caption: um

05:01:34.240 --> 05:01:38.240
Caption: you&#39;re not really creating a

05:01:36.957 --> 05:01:40.478
Caption: a sense of trust with your users you&#39;re

05:01:38.240 --> 05:01:42.638
Caption: saying trust me i know what i&#39;m talking

05:01:40.480 --> 05:01:44.560
Caption: about whereas if you explain the reasons

05:01:42.638 --> 05:01:46.878
Caption: why and you start engaging with clients

05:01:44.560 --> 05:01:48.160
Caption: and users it starts to build some of

05:01:46.878 --> 05:01:50.718
Caption: this

05:01:48.160 --> 05:01:52.320
Caption: ability to generate the trust that they

05:01:50.718 --> 05:01:54.480
Caption: go okay this person does understand our

05:01:52.320 --> 05:01:56.240
Caption: problems this person does kind of

05:01:54.480 --> 05:01:59.201
Caption: understand our solutions maybe i should

05:01:56.240 --> 05:02:01.519
Caption: listen to him

05:01:59.199 --> 05:02:02.876
Caption: secondly it generates buy-in

05:02:01.519 --> 05:02:04.480
Caption: so

05:02:02.878 --> 05:02:06.480
Caption: going that extra step further than

05:02:04.480 --> 05:02:07.679
Caption: explaining why we&#39;re doing something

05:02:06.480 --> 05:02:08.638
Caption: rather than just using the term best

05:02:07.679 --> 05:02:10.080
Caption: practice

05:02:08.638 --> 05:02:11.681
Caption: we start generating buy-in from

05:02:10.080 --> 05:02:12.878
Caption: different stakeholders

05:02:11.679 --> 05:02:14.636
Caption: different users people within the

05:02:12.878 --> 05:02:15.441
Caption: project group because they understand

05:02:14.638 --> 05:02:16.400
Caption: why

05:02:15.439 --> 05:02:18.400
Caption: um

05:02:16.400 --> 05:02:20.160
Caption: especially from a junior perspective

05:02:18.400 --> 05:02:21.439
Caption: with junior people coming in if we say

05:02:20.160 --> 05:02:23.199
Caption: you&#39;re doing that simply because it&#39;s

05:02:21.439 --> 05:02:24.957
Caption: best practice they&#39;re not learning

05:02:23.199 --> 05:02:27.199
Caption: they&#39;re not understanding why they&#39;re

05:02:24.957 --> 05:02:29.039
Caption: not going that one step further to say

05:02:27.199 --> 05:02:30.716
Caption: well what is it that we&#39;re

05:02:29.039 --> 05:02:32.318
Caption: you know trying to achieve and what are

05:02:30.718 --> 05:02:34.160
Caption: our constraints what are what are some

05:02:32.320 --> 05:02:36.638
Caption: of these these issues that we need to

05:02:34.160 --> 05:02:39.199
Caption: work through

05:02:36.638 --> 05:02:40.958
Caption: and finally we create a shared vision

05:02:39.199 --> 05:02:42.957
Caption: so when people if we do come across a

05:02:40.957 --> 05:02:44.716
Caption: problem people can go look i know what

05:02:42.957 --> 05:02:46.636
Caption: we&#39;re trying to do let me find a

05:02:44.718 --> 05:02:48.638
Caption: solution to that and so they&#39;ve got a

05:02:46.638 --> 05:02:49.919
Caption: better understanding as to

05:02:48.638 --> 05:02:51.759
Caption: what

05:02:49.919 --> 05:02:53.119
Caption: they&#39;re looking for they can go that one

05:02:51.759 --> 05:02:54.957
Caption: step further they can use their

05:02:53.119 --> 05:02:58.796
Caption: initiative because they&#39;re

05:02:54.957 --> 05:02:58.796
Caption: bought on board as to the reasons why

05:02:59.119 --> 05:03:02.158
Caption: so how do we achieve this

05:03:02.718 --> 05:03:05.281
Caption: firstly we understand the problem and i

05:03:04.080 --> 05:03:06.958
Caption: know this is going to sound very very

05:03:05.279 --> 05:03:09.439
Caption: basic for a lot of you but we understand

05:03:06.957 --> 05:03:10.398
Caption: the problem so starting from that

05:03:09.439 --> 05:03:12.240
Caption: problem

05:03:10.400 --> 05:03:13.839
Caption: first

05:03:12.240 --> 05:03:15.439
Caption: we then start to organize some of these

05:03:13.839 --> 05:03:17.519
Caption: organizational priorities so

05:03:15.439 --> 05:03:19.439
Caption: understanding not only what the problem

05:03:17.519 --> 05:03:22.160
Caption: is but why it&#39;s a problem and what

05:03:19.439 --> 05:03:24.000
Caption: they&#39;re trying to achieve from it

05:03:22.160 --> 05:03:26.000
Caption: understanding constraints so these can

05:03:24.000 --> 05:03:28.080
Caption: be anything from cost to

05:03:26.000 --> 05:03:29.199
Caption: the politics again

05:03:28.080 --> 05:03:31.919
Caption: going into an organization as a

05:03:29.199 --> 05:03:34.558
Caption: consultant a lot of the times we

05:03:31.919 --> 05:03:36.638
Caption: we have to navigate things like politics

05:03:34.560 --> 05:03:38.480
Caption: we have to navigate uh their

05:03:36.638 --> 05:03:39.759
Caption: environments we need to navigate

05:03:38.480 --> 05:03:41.201
Caption: various different things like even the

05:03:39.759 --> 05:03:42.000
Caption: people some people

05:03:41.199 --> 05:03:43.599
Caption: you know

05:03:42.000 --> 05:03:45.119
Caption: all those those personalities that you

05:03:43.599 --> 05:03:46.240
Caption: need to navigate and when we start

05:03:45.119 --> 05:03:47.519
Caption: throwing in best practice you&#39;re

05:03:46.240 --> 05:03:48.878
Caption: basically just creating a bearing going

05:03:47.519 --> 05:03:51.519
Caption: look trust me i know what i&#39;m talking

05:03:48.878 --> 05:03:53.601
Caption: about

05:03:51.519 --> 05:03:55.599
Caption: then exploring the options so once you

05:03:53.599 --> 05:03:56.560
Caption: understand what it is we&#39;re trying to

05:03:55.599 --> 05:03:58.957
Caption: achieve

05:03:56.560 --> 05:04:00.798
Caption: i&#39;m putting that towards then coming up

05:03:58.957 --> 05:04:03.039
Caption: with the different options now these you

05:04:00.798 --> 05:04:04.958
Caption: could go through and say best practice

05:04:03.039 --> 05:04:06.716
Caption: et cetera but not using the term best

05:04:04.957 --> 05:04:08.000
Caption: practice going cool we can solve this

05:04:06.718 --> 05:04:09.601
Caption: and this is a good option to go for

05:04:08.000 --> 05:04:10.878
Caption: because it meets our constraints it

05:04:09.599 --> 05:04:12.957
Caption: meets our problem

05:04:10.878 --> 05:04:16.400
Caption: it meets our goals and suddenly that&#39;s a

05:04:12.957 --> 05:04:19.839
Caption: much more powerful story

05:04:16.400 --> 05:04:22.000
Caption: and then as a team deciding what

05:04:19.839 --> 05:04:22.957
Caption: solution to go for

05:04:22.000 --> 05:04:24.798
Caption: um

05:04:22.957 --> 05:04:26.078
Caption: and so this is then taking it from a

05:04:24.798 --> 05:04:27.361
Caption: solution-driven approach where we&#39;re

05:04:26.080 --> 05:04:29.041
Caption: going all right let&#39;s find best practice

05:04:27.359 --> 05:04:30.160
Caption: and implement that to okay what are we

05:04:29.039 --> 05:04:31.279
Caption: trying to solve cool we&#39;re going to

05:04:30.160 --> 05:04:32.718
Caption: implement something that&#39;s solving that

05:04:31.279 --> 05:04:33.599
Caption: problem

05:04:32.718 --> 05:04:34.798
Caption: so

05:04:33.599 --> 05:04:36.968
Caption: to kind of quickly sum up because i&#39;ve

05:04:34.798 --> 05:04:38.400
Caption: been given the one minute warning

05:04:36.970 --> 05:04:40.480
Caption: [Music]

05:04:38.400 --> 05:04:42.480
Caption: it&#39;s not about changing an entire way of

05:04:40.480 --> 05:04:44.560
Caption: working but just changing our mindsets

05:04:42.480 --> 05:04:46.798
Caption: to ban the term and i ban the term best

05:04:44.560 --> 05:04:48.000
Caption: practice from all of my teams if my

05:04:46.798 --> 05:04:49.601
Caption: teams are coming up to me talking about

05:04:48.000 --> 05:04:50.878
Caption: problems and they use the term best

05:04:49.599 --> 05:04:52.876
Caption: practice i tell them to go away and come

05:04:50.878 --> 05:04:54.480
Caption: back to me when they&#39;ve actually

05:04:52.878 --> 05:04:56.480
Caption: done that research and gone come back

05:04:54.480 --> 05:04:58.400
Caption: with an actual plan

05:04:56.480 --> 05:05:01.121
Caption: and so it just starts with just banning

05:04:58.400 --> 05:05:02.400
Caption: those two terms best practice

05:05:01.119 --> 05:05:03.919
Caption: thank you very much

05:05:02.400 --> 05:05:05.031
Caption: there&#39;s my references and thanks to the

05:05:03.919 --> 05:05:13.167
Caption: sponsors

05:05:05.029 --> 05:05:13.167
Caption: [Applause]

05:05:15.759 --> 05:05:21.599
Caption: and here is don thanks mate cheers

05:05:19.839 --> 05:05:23.359
Caption: all right i&#39;m just conscious uh we&#39;re at

05:05:21.599 --> 05:05:25.759
Caption: the end of the day it&#39;s the afternoon so

05:05:23.359 --> 05:05:26.636
Caption: we&#39;re going to try and

05:05:25.759 --> 05:05:29.119
Caption: do

05:05:26.638 --> 05:05:31.361
Caption: a very quick fire my presentation today

05:05:29.119 --> 05:05:33.919
Caption: is a very lightweight type presentation

05:05:31.359 --> 05:05:35.759
Caption: it&#39;s nice it&#39;s it&#39;s a brain candy but it

05:05:33.919 --> 05:05:37.519
Caption: does have an important message in it and

05:05:35.759 --> 05:05:38.957
Caption: that important message is about test

05:05:37.519 --> 05:05:41.119
Caption: automation

05:05:38.957 --> 05:05:43.839
Caption: and one of the biggest blockers that

05:05:41.119 --> 05:05:45.199
Caption: most teams out there get wrong and it&#39;s

05:05:43.839 --> 05:05:47.279
Caption: what&#39;s stopping your automation from

05:05:45.199 --> 05:05:49.679
Caption: being successful now i&#39;m going to tell

05:05:47.279 --> 05:05:50.716
Caption: this story today about a naked emperor

05:05:49.679 --> 05:05:52.716
Caption: is there a naked emperor in your

05:05:50.718 --> 05:05:54.320
Caption: development team it&#39;s a story that&#39;s a

05:05:52.718 --> 05:05:55.839
Caption: thousand years old it&#39;s been done in 100

05:05:54.320 --> 05:05:57.919
Caption: different languages today you&#39;re going

05:05:55.839 --> 05:05:59.119
Caption: to get a very short very aussie sort of

05:05:57.919 --> 05:06:01.359
Caption: version of that

05:05:59.119 --> 05:06:03.279
Caption: which is how i like things and we&#39;ll

05:06:01.359 --> 05:06:05.439
Caption: fire through that and as i&#39;m doing that

05:07:27.839 --> 05:07:30.876
Caption: a day

05:07:28.718 --> 05:07:33.521
Caption: and these guys are like

05:07:30.878 --> 05:07:36.000
Caption: they get they get locked away in a room

05:07:33.519 --> 05:07:37.359
Caption: and they&#39;re thinking uh okay

05:07:36.000 --> 05:07:38.878
Caption: that&#39;s an interesting challenge we&#39;ve

05:07:37.359 --> 05:07:41.039
Caption: got here

05:07:38.878 --> 05:07:43.601
Caption: so they set about doing what they know

05:07:41.039 --> 05:07:45.039
Caption: they build things they set up machinery

05:07:43.599 --> 05:07:47.439
Caption: they set up equipment and they&#39;ve got

05:07:45.039 --> 05:07:48.796
Caption: this continuous delivery fashion line

05:07:47.439 --> 05:07:52.160
Caption: which they&#39;re sort of

05:07:48.798 --> 05:07:53.441
Caption: uh creating one small problem though

05:07:52.160 --> 05:07:54.798
Caption: as they&#39;re locked away in this little

05:07:53.439 --> 05:07:57.039
Caption: dungeon area

05:07:54.798 --> 05:07:58.798
Caption: we don&#39;t have any fabric to work with

05:07:57.039 --> 05:08:00.716
Caption: what are we meant to do and the emperor

05:07:58.798 --> 05:08:02.798
Caption: says look you guys are so talented

05:08:00.718 --> 05:08:04.240
Caption: you&#39;re so good at making things

05:08:02.798 --> 05:08:06.080
Caption: you&#39;re practically magicians i&#39;m sure

05:08:04.240 --> 05:08:07.121

05:08:06.080 --> 05:08:08.480
Caption: um

05:08:07.119 --> 05:08:09.919
Caption: and they&#39;re a bit puzzled they&#39;re

05:08:08.480 --> 05:08:11.041
Caption: stressing right because these guys are

05:08:09.919 --> 05:08:12.080
Caption: going to get their heads locked off by

05:08:11.039 --> 05:08:13.039
Caption: this bloke when they show up with

05:08:12.080 --> 05:08:15.279
Caption: nothing

05:08:13.039 --> 05:08:17.119
Caption: but they know he&#39;s he&#39;s equally vain and

05:08:15.279 --> 05:08:18.478
Caption: equally stupid so

05:08:17.119 --> 05:08:20.398
Caption: they come up with an idea because these

05:08:18.480 --> 05:08:22.160
Caption: are the smart guys

05:08:20.400 --> 05:08:24.638
Caption: in the story

05:08:22.160 --> 05:08:26.400

05:09:03.119 --> 05:09:06.398

Caption: great test great test automation but how

05:12:05.519 --> 05:12:10.400
Caption: do you get the fabric

05:12:07.199 --> 05:12:13.279
Caption: well fabric makers make fabric

05:12:10.400 --> 05:12:14.718
Caption: and testers make tests

05:12:13.279 --> 05:12:16.000
Caption: okay

05:12:14.718 --> 05:12:17.601
Caption: testers

05:12:16.000 --> 05:12:19.039
Caption: are our special

05:12:17.599 --> 05:12:21.439
Caption: special breed

05:12:19.039 --> 05:12:22.876
Caption: and these days we are told

05:12:21.439 --> 05:12:24.636
Caption: oh but we&#39;re all cross-functional we&#39;re

05:12:22.878 --> 05:12:26.841
Caption: all unicorns right so we can all we&#39;re

05:12:24.638 --> 05:12:28.798
Caption: all full stack devs we all code like

05:12:26.839 --> 05:12:30.400
Caption: demons um

05:12:28.798 --> 05:12:32.400
Caption: i could run the agile rituals better

05:12:30.400 --> 05:12:33.919
Caption: than that seasoned scrum master and i

05:12:32.400 --> 05:12:36.240
Caption: know more about product ownership than

05:12:33.919 --> 05:12:38.957
Caption: the product owner and of course we&#39;re

05:12:36.240 --> 05:12:41.439
Caption: all legendary testers right

05:12:38.957 --> 05:12:45.119
Caption: uh no not so much that&#39;s not reality

05:12:41.439 --> 05:12:47.599
Caption: that&#39;s the textbook the reality is

05:12:45.119 --> 05:12:49.199
Caption: we all specialize those those different

05:12:47.599 --> 05:12:50.876
Caption: roles are fundamentally different in

05:12:49.199 --> 05:12:52.636
Caption: terms of how you think in terms of your

05:12:50.878 --> 05:12:54.958
Caption: career progression the study and the

05:12:52.638 --> 05:12:56.480
Caption: time you&#39;ve put into them

05:12:54.957 --> 05:12:58.558
Caption: so

05:12:56.480 --> 05:13:00.320
Caption: i&#39;ll put it to you another way every

05:12:58.560 --> 05:13:02.160
Caption: tester out there has dabbled a little

05:13:00.320 --> 05:13:03.839
Caption: bit in coding and there&#39;s a very small

05:13:02.160 --> 05:13:05.279
Caption: number of testers who are so good at

05:13:03.839 --> 05:13:06.480
Caption: coding i&#39;d say they&#39;re probably as good

05:13:05.279 --> 05:13:08.398
Caption: as developers

05:13:06.480 --> 05:13:10.320
Caption: but i wouldn&#39;t then go out and say hey

05:13:08.400 --> 05:13:11.919
Caption: testers you&#39;ve all dabbled in coding

05:13:10.320 --> 05:13:13.759
Caption: you&#39;re on our developers go start

05:13:11.919 --> 05:13:14.798
Caption: writing our enterprise systems you

05:13:13.759 --> 05:13:16.480
Caption: wouldn&#39;t do that that would be

05:13:14.798 --> 05:13:17.841
Caption: ridiculous

05:13:16.480 --> 05:13:19.919
Caption: so

05:13:17.839 --> 05:13:21.839
Caption: the reverse is also true when the

05:13:19.919 --> 05:13:24.000
Caption: emperors ask developers and they say

05:13:21.839 --> 05:13:25.839
Caption: look you guys are amazing at coding you

05:13:24.000 --> 05:13:28.000
Caption: should all be involved in testing all

05:13:25.839 --> 05:13:29.679
Caption: good developers are but we don&#39;t expect

05:13:28.000 --> 05:13:31.359
Caption: you to be professional testers because

05:13:29.679 --> 05:13:33.359
Caption: that&#39;s a different career path it&#39;s

05:13:31.359 --> 05:13:36.876
Caption: different skills and it&#39;s different it&#39;s

05:13:33.359 --> 05:13:36.876
Caption: a whole different background to life so

05:13:37.279 --> 05:13:40.160
Caption: professional testers if you&#39;ve ever

05:13:38.638 --> 05:13:41.281
Caption: worked with one they&#39;re a different

05:13:40.160 --> 05:13:43.121
Caption: breed

05:13:41.279 --> 05:13:45.359
Caption: they think differently

05:13:43.119 --> 05:13:46.957
Caption: they are magnets for errors

05:13:45.359 --> 05:13:49.919
Caption: a normal person

05:13:46.957 --> 05:13:52.318
Caption: normal wait choose my words i&#39;m a tester

05:13:49.919 --> 05:13:54.320
Caption: writer so i&#39;ll go with that they might

05:13:52.320 --> 05:13:55.839
Caption: think of five or five or five things

05:13:54.320 --> 05:13:57.679
Caption: that could go wrong a tester will tell

05:13:55.839 --> 05:14:00.000
Caption: you 101 things will go wrong they&#39;re

05:13:57.679 --> 05:14:01.599
Caption: fixated on breaking things not making

05:14:00.000 --> 05:14:03.679
Caption: things it&#39;s a completely different

05:14:01.599 --> 05:14:05.519
Caption: mindset in an interview i can tell you

05:14:03.679 --> 05:14:07.519
Caption: within two or three questions whether

05:14:05.519 --> 05:14:09.119
Caption: someone&#39;s a developer or a tester by how

05:14:07.519 --> 05:14:10.716
Caption: they answer those questions whatever

05:14:09.119 --> 05:14:12.796
Caption: they think they might be it&#39;s quite

05:14:10.718 --> 05:14:14.400
Caption: evident brains work differently they&#39;ve

05:14:12.798 --> 05:14:16.798
Caption: also spent years training in their

05:14:14.400 --> 05:14:19.201
Caption: profession learning skills techniques

05:14:16.798 --> 05:14:21.681
Caption: getting certifications in testing

05:14:19.199 --> 05:14:24.796
Caption: specifically for testing to create that

05:14:21.679 --> 05:14:28.636
Caption: great fabric or tests

05:14:24.798 --> 05:14:31.841
Caption: it&#39;s a point that emperors often miss

05:14:28.638 --> 05:14:33.361
Caption: now remember the guy in the story

05:14:31.839 --> 05:14:35.519
Caption: well in the world of test automation

05:14:33.359 --> 05:14:36.636
Caption: that&#39;s me i&#39;m not a developer but i do

05:14:35.519 --> 05:14:39.039
Caption: get the privilege of working with

05:14:36.638 --> 05:14:40.400
Caption: development teams right across perth and

05:14:39.039 --> 05:14:42.398
Caption: they open their doors and we see the

05:14:40.400 --> 05:14:44.160
Caption: automation that&#39;s being produced

05:14:42.400 --> 05:14:45.839
Caption: and while some shops are doing an

05:14:44.160 --> 05:14:47.359
Caption: incredible job they&#39;re creating great

05:14:45.839 --> 05:14:49.039
Caption: automation and it&#39;s a beautiful thing

05:14:47.359 --> 05:14:51.279
Caption: when you see it

05:14:49.039 --> 05:14:54.078
Caption: i&#39;d say the majority or many of them

05:14:51.279 --> 05:14:55.919
Caption: have emperors in the establishment who

05:14:54.080 --> 05:14:58.080
Caption: are spending a lot of money and expense

05:14:55.919 --> 05:15:00.718
Caption: putting together toolkits spending a lot

05:14:58.080 --> 05:15:02.240
Caption: of time building stuff that

05:15:00.718 --> 05:15:03.761
Caption: amounts to a whole lot of nothing if i&#39;m

05:15:02.240 --> 05:15:06.000
Caption: being frank

05:15:03.759 --> 05:15:07.039
Caption: because i don&#39;t have the fabric

05:15:06.000 --> 05:15:08.798
Caption: so

05:15:07.039 --> 05:15:09.839
Caption: what are the two lessons two takeaways

05:15:08.798 --> 05:15:11.761
Caption: from today

05:15:09.839 --> 05:15:13.359
Caption: how to spot an acred emperor and how to

05:15:11.759 --> 05:15:14.839
Caption: avoid being one yourself like don&#39;t be

05:15:13.359 --> 05:15:17.679
Caption: that guy that asks people to do the

05:15:14.839 --> 05:15:19.679
Caption: impossible well firstly

05:15:17.679 --> 05:15:21.119
Caption: professional testers make the great

05:15:19.679 --> 05:15:22.636
Caption: tests and that&#39;s where you get your

05:15:21.119 --> 05:15:24.318
Caption: great test automation it&#39;s a key

05:15:22.638 --> 05:15:26.240
Caption: ingredient that&#39;s often missing and

05:15:24.320 --> 05:15:28.160
Caption: that&#39;s the point of the talk so if you

05:15:26.240 --> 05:15:29.839
Caption: want to spot a naked emperor someone

05:15:28.160 --> 05:15:31.439
Caption: that&#39;s asking developers to do things

05:15:29.839 --> 05:15:32.957
Caption: with no fabric

05:15:31.439 --> 05:15:34.796
Caption: the second thing is if you&#39;re working in

05:15:32.957 --> 05:15:36.558
Caption: an environment where you&#39;re not getting

05:15:34.798 --> 05:15:39.041
Caption: that great fabric

05:15:36.560 --> 05:15:40.160
Caption: don&#39;t be afraid to be that guy that just

05:15:39.039 --> 05:15:42.078
Caption: calls it out

05:15:40.160 --> 05:15:44.560
Caption: because without that people are going to

05:15:42.080 --> 05:15:45.359
Caption: continue murmuring in the crowd

05:15:44.560 --> 05:15:47.121
Caption: and

05:15:45.359 --> 05:15:48.558
Caption: nodding and pretending like yeah we&#39;re

05:15:47.119 --> 05:15:50.158
Caption: doing great with automation we&#39;ve got 5

05:15:48.560 --> 05:15:52.400
Caption: 000 tests done and there&#39;s a whole lot

05:15:50.160 --> 05:15:55.279
Caption: of nothing what that does it leaves you

05:15:52.400 --> 05:15:56.958
Caption: exposed and that is bloody embarrassing

05:15:55.279 --> 05:15:58.240
Caption: so

05:15:56.957 --> 05:16:00.238
Caption: if you&#39;re looking to make software

05:15:58.240 --> 05:16:02.320
Caption: better

05:16:00.240 --> 05:16:03.919
Caption: two two tips from today i hope you

05:16:02.320 --> 05:16:06.080
Caption: remember them and i&#39;m happy to have

05:16:03.919 --> 05:16:07.759
Caption: discussions afterwards but

05:16:06.080 --> 05:16:09.279
Caption: hopefully that&#39;s been lightweight and

05:16:07.759 --> 05:16:12.439
Caption: entertaining as i promised thank you

05:16:09.279 --> 05:16:12.439
