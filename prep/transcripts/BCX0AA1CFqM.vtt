Caption: be talking about how to be productive

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.119
Caption: when working remote a little bit about

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.520
Caption: me is that we have been working remote

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.860
Caption: for five years

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:12.839

Caption: feel sorry for me or anything like that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.680
Caption: it&#39;s actually more for anybody in the

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:33.419
Caption: room who might have their own diagnosis

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.279
Caption: and needs to see the evidence in the

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:37.500
Caption: room

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:39.419
Caption: um I also talk in the media a lot you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.059
Caption: see my face sometimes on the television

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:45.500
Caption: uh and on the radio I think it&#39;s

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:45.500
Caption: hilarious that they let me

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:51.239
Caption: um and also the biggest deal is that my

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:54.360
Caption: team is here for the first time ever

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:58.680
Caption: together in the same room and the same

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.299
Caption: state can I get you guys to stand up

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.739
Caption: no they&#39;re not going to stand up because

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.740
Caption: they&#39;re shy introverts

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:09.419
Caption: um so some notes about this talk

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.699
Caption: today what I&#39;m going to go through is

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.259
Caption: the benefits of remote work from the

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:15.059
Caption: position of the employer and the

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.220
Caption: employee I&#39;m going to talk about the

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:19.378
Caption: challenges of remote work and healthy

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.779
Caption: boundaries in communication and

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:24.539
Caption: distraction guilt I&#39;m also going to talk

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:26.940
Caption: about adapting the environment and what

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:29.399
Caption: that&#39;s meant for us and I&#39;m going to put

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.559
Caption: some final notes and Lessons Learned

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:33.598
Caption: From the pandemic

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:35.279
Caption: so first off

00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:38.039
Caption: time coverage

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.539
Caption: benefits for the employer so two of our

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.799
Caption: team that&#39;s flown in from Melbourne and

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.559
Caption: Sydney

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.300
Caption: they are obviously two hours wait are

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.440
Caption: you ahead or behind I can&#39;t remember my

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.279
Caption: brain&#39;s not working

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.279
Caption: ahead cool

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.180
Caption: so on either side of the day we actually

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.500
Caption: have an extra four hours for our clients

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:58.098
Caption: so it means that we have a little bit

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.098
Caption: extra coverage

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:02.339
Caption: um more focused work happens when we&#39;re

00:03:00.238 --> 00:03:06.360
Caption: working remote because we don&#39;t have

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:08.518
Caption: meetings on Zoom every day

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.158
Caption: because we get fatigued

00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:12.419
Caption: we figured that out really early on in

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:14.220
Caption: the pandemic

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.738
Caption: is

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.440
Caption: um a larger pool of future employees

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:22.738
Caption: so I mentioned before I have cptsd

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.059
Caption: anxiety disorder half of our team have

00:03:22.738 --> 00:03:28.500
Caption: PTSD executive dysfunction ADHD all of

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:29.539
Caption: the other acronyms

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.878
Caption: um

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:36.000
Caption: and what it means is that we cater for a

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:37.139
Caption: higher level of neurodivergence

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.878
Caption: so

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.738
Caption: having different types of work Styles

00:03:38.878 --> 00:03:44.158
Caption: means that we actually have different

00:03:40.738 --> 00:03:47.220
Caption: values that we can add to the business

00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:49.500
Caption: reduce fixed cost for a business owner

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.220
Caption: is really important so obviously I don&#39;t

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.220
Caption: pay for an office

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:57.119
Caption: um and for me that became really

00:03:54.658 --> 00:03:58.378
Caption: important because I want to invest in my

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:00.000
Caption: team

00:03:58.378 --> 00:04:02.580
Caption: so as a business you could see this as

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.679
Caption: an opportunity to downsize and reduce

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.779
Caption: operating costs and invest more in your

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:09.259
Caption: people technology and for me also

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:09.259
Caption: training

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.299
Caption: benefits for the employee less time in

00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:20.458
Caption: commute he loves commuting not me

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.759
Caption: on average in Western Australia you

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.340
Caption: could spend 26.5 days a year

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.320
Caption: commuting to work

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:30.779
Caption: that&#39;s a lot of time

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.759
Caption: for our team the fact that we don&#39;t have

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:34.199
Caption: to commute to work means that we have

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.419
Caption: that time back and we can spend it on

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.699
Caption: our Hobbies

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.679
Caption: for which we have many

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.040
Caption: um so Hobbies like roller skating wool

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:46.519
Caption: spinning Kira has three spinning wheels

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.080
Caption: yep counting

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:51.839
Caption: gardening food video games photography

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:53.758
Caption: music one of our team who isn&#39;t here

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:56.699
Caption: unfortunately because he&#39;s unwell

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:59.639
Caption: is a musician

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:02.880
Caption: so things like nurturing support in a

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.460
Caption: business the idea that someone being

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.380
Caption: late for work in our business doesn&#39;t

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:10.019
Caption: exist

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.199
Caption: one of the things that I say often to my

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:15.899
Caption: team is work to your biorhythms

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.059
Caption: not to what the business needs work to

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:20.339
Caption: what you need

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:22.139
Caption: the reason why that change was made is

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:25.199
Caption: because that we tell ourselves a lot of

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.699
Caption: stories coming from corporate work or

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.459
Caption: previous works that we might have worked

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:33.380
Caption: with how many of you have heard things

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:33.380
Caption: like leave your life at the door

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.220
Caption: couple people

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:40.918
Caption: so

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.779
Caption: more Hobbies less time and compute

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.759
Caption: suited work environment

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:45.660
Caption: so each of us obviously work in our own

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.080
Caption: homes

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.820
Caption: or at a cafe or at the beach

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:53.519
Caption: or in the middle of

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.740
Caption: a wonderful Forest

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:57.959
Caption: so uniquely to each team member we all

00:05:55.739 --> 00:06:01.399
Caption: get to work with our best colleagues as

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:01.399
Caption: well our pets

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:11.000
Caption: so some challenges for working remote

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.860
Caption: considering boundaries

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.859
Caption: now normally like Christina mentioned it

00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:18.478
Caption: this morning in her incredible keynote

00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:20.698
Caption: about the idea that people just sort of

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:23.100
Caption: check in and go oh can you just have a

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.199
Caption: quick look at that for me I just yeah

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.360
Caption: could could you just have a look at this

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.619
Caption: and there&#39;s this constant disruption

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:30.619
Caption: that happens in an office

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.259
Caption: how that looks online is 27 messages on

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.240
Caption: Discord

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.339
Caption: or Slack

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:42.119
Caption: so re-learning what that looks like for

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:44.279
Caption: you

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:46.319
Caption: when you don&#39;t have an open door policy

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.639
Caption: in your office

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:51.619
Caption: is then figuring out what your

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.619
Caption: boundaries look like in your home

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.179
Caption: there&#39;s potential for scope slip

00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:59.399
Caption: so because we&#39;re not talking to each

00:06:57.179 --> 00:07:02.759
Caption: other face to face every day

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:05.100
Caption: our interactions are often online

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:08.720
Caption: and if things get complicated

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.720
Caption: text on the screen can make it worse

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.259
Caption: has anybody ever heard of procrasta

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.779
Caption: chores

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:18.179
Caption: laughs

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:20.160
Caption: I&#39;m trying to get it to Trend

00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:23.098
Caption: um procrastination when you&#39;re working

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.139
Caption: from home it&#39;s really easy for you to

00:07:23.098 --> 00:07:28.259
Caption: get distracted with all of the things

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:31.619
Caption: that you&#39;ve got going on in your home

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:34.319
Caption: for me I have been for the last six

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:36.419
Caption: weeks trying to film some videos for

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:38.399
Caption: some courses that we&#39;re doing and

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:41.279
Caption: instead of filming the videos what I

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:42.899
Caption: decided in my head was I would clean my

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:45.779
Caption: entire house

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:47.959
Caption: reorganize my storage room and paint a

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:47.959
Caption: wall

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:51.979
Caption: foreign

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:51.979
Caption: black

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:59.299
Caption: so work life and your life can creep

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:59.300
Caption: into each other&#39;s spaces

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:03.179
Caption: one of the key things about that is be

00:08:01.619 --> 00:08:05.399
Caption: gentle with yourself don&#39;t judge

00:08:03.179 --> 00:08:07.579
Caption: yourself too harshly for that we all do

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:07.579
Caption: it

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:13.819
Caption: one of the other challenges that we have

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.619
Caption: is finding ways to close the distance

00:08:13.819 --> 00:08:18.720
Caption: between the team

00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:21.239
Caption: working in isolation can get really hard

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.220
Caption: and making sure that you&#39;ve got regular

00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:25.079
Caption: check-ins and that you&#39;re having

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.119
Caption: conversations that are not just work

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:28.978
Caption: conversations are actually really

00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:31.079
Caption: valuable

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:32.299
Caption: so we&#39;ve all been working together for

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:35.760
Caption: five years

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:37.380
Caption: and it took us for the pandemic to

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.940
Caption: happen for us to realize that we didn&#39;t

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.140
Caption: actually really know anything about each

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.239
Caption: other

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.979
Caption: because we are efficient we have all

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:46.979
Caption: these conversations about the work stuff

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:49.739
Caption: because that&#39;s what the meeting&#39;s for

00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:51.299
Caption: so we don&#39;t have the water cooler to

00:08:49.739 --> 00:08:53.398
Caption: have those oh what did you get up to on

00:08:51.299 --> 00:08:54.838
Caption: the weekend those conversations are

00:08:53.398 --> 00:08:57.200
Caption: actually really valuable to your

00:08:54.838 --> 00:08:57.200
Caption: workplace

00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:03.018
Caption: distraction guilt who&#39;s watched seven

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:06.838
Caption: seasons of Frasier

00:09:03.018 --> 00:09:09.500
Caption: three people well it&#39;s suddenly feeling

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:09.500
Caption: more guilty

00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:16.919
Caption: so there is studies to say that people

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:18.239
Caption: who work from home tend to work more out

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:19.919
Caption: of guilt

00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:22.320
Caption: because they might have taken a little

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:26.479
Caption: bit longer for lunch they might have

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.479
Caption: streamed a few too many episodes

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.720
Caption: instead of actually doing work

00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:34.018
Caption: again one of the rules in our businesses

00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:36.778
Caption: work to your own flow

00:09:34.018 --> 00:09:40.200
Caption: so long as the job gets done

00:09:36.778 --> 00:09:42.359
Caption: we have two deadlines one is the real

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.919
Caption: deadline for the client the other is our

00:09:42.359 --> 00:09:46.159
Caption: internal deadline which is two weeks

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:46.159
Caption: prior

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.419
Caption: different communication styles

00:09:50.338 --> 00:09:53.640
Caption: with everybody&#39;s different

00:09:51.419 --> 00:09:55.559
Caption: neurodiversities

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.720
Caption: having awareness around the other

00:09:55.559 --> 00:10:00.359
Caption: person&#39;s communication style can be

00:09:57.719 --> 00:10:02.518
Caption: really challenging most of the time we

00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:04.099
Caption: will communicate in the ways that we

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:08.159
Caption: prefer best

00:10:04.099 --> 00:10:12.179
Caption: I am the worst culprit for this

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:14.579
Caption: I will often send things to my team at

00:10:12.179 --> 00:10:15.778
Caption: rapid fire hey could you do this hey

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.100
Caption: could you do this hey I forgot about

00:10:15.778 --> 00:10:19.380
Caption: this

00:10:17.099 --> 00:10:22.018
Caption: I am working on it

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.119
Caption: work in progress

00:10:22.018 --> 00:10:26.458
Caption: but remembering that other people

00:10:24.119 --> 00:10:30.898
Caption: receive information differently and

00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:33.659
Caption: trying to accommodate them recognize it

00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:36.059
Caption: so adapting the environment

00:10:33.659 --> 00:10:37.859
Caption: there&#39;s an importance of designated

00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:39.898
Caption: workspace

00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:41.640
Caption: Kira very much has two different

00:10:39.898 --> 00:10:43.619
Caption: workspaces so at the beginning of the

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.239
Caption: day she starts in her chair in her

00:10:43.619 --> 00:10:47.659
Caption: office by the end of the day she&#39;s on

00:10:45.239 --> 00:10:47.659
Caption: her couch

00:10:48.119 --> 00:10:51.299
Caption: so a lot of that is about healthy

00:10:50.278 --> 00:10:53.219
Caption: boundaries

00:10:51.299 --> 00:10:55.078
Caption: for her mind her space and her

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:58.259
Caption: relationship with work

00:10:55.078 --> 00:11:00.539
Caption: with me this led to a very specific

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:03.838
Caption: purchase when I bought my house

00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:08.759
Caption: I have an upstairs and a downstairs

00:11:03.838 --> 00:11:11.359
Caption: upstairs is work downstairs is home they

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.359
Caption: do not cross

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.919
Caption: so once I step out of work literally and

00:11:15.359 --> 00:11:19.739
Caption: figuratively

00:11:16.919 --> 00:11:21.898
Caption: I am in my home space mode

00:11:19.739 --> 00:11:23.940
Caption: and that&#39;s very important because one of

00:11:21.898 --> 00:11:26.239
Caption: the people that I work with is also my

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.239
Caption: partner

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:32.760
Caption: activities for breaks so we have what we

00:11:30.299 --> 00:11:35.159
Caption: call a circuit breaker event

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.419
Caption: for me it&#39;s going to do a food shop in

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:38.458
Caption: the middle of the day when nobody else

00:11:36.419 --> 00:11:40.320
Caption: is at the shops but it&#39;s to get me

00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:42.778
Caption: outside of my house and outside of

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:47.299
Caption: outside of my environment to make sure

00:11:42.778 --> 00:11:47.299
Caption: that my brain is not getting too clouded

00:11:47.458 --> 00:11:51.659
Caption: work time and home time

00:11:49.739 --> 00:11:53.640
Caption: is your choice

00:11:51.659 --> 00:11:55.739
Caption: if you stay late you&#39;re choosing that

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.119
Caption: and everything has to be a conscious

00:11:55.739 --> 00:11:59.219
Caption: choice

00:11:57.119 --> 00:12:02.578
Caption: nobody is putting a gun against your

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:05.838
Caption: head asking you to work late hours

00:12:02.578 --> 00:12:05.838
Caption: certainly not in our business

00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:11.099
Caption: one of the things that I say quite

00:12:08.099 --> 00:12:14.119
Caption: regularly to the team is so long it is

00:12:11.099 --> 00:12:14.119
Caption: as it is healthy

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:24.059
Caption: meal prep is actually way more important

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:25.739
Caption: for neurodiverse people

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:27.359
Caption: um well it&#39;s important for everyone but

00:12:25.739 --> 00:12:30.659
Caption: for people who are neurodiverse

00:12:27.359 --> 00:12:33.419
Caption: sometimes you can get really super hyper

00:12:30.659 --> 00:12:36.018
Caption: fixated on things and then you don&#39;t eat

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:36.018
Caption: for two days

00:12:36.838 --> 00:12:40.518
Caption: yeah

00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:42.958
Caption: definitely me

00:12:40.518 --> 00:12:45.059
Caption: Kira is a recent convert to having

00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.458
Caption: lunches she&#39;s very angry about it but

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:49.138
Caption: she loves it really

00:12:46.458 --> 00:12:51.239
Caption: and she&#39;s eating lunches which are more

00:12:49.138 --> 00:12:53.759
Caption: than a cereal box

00:12:51.239 --> 00:12:56.239
Caption: it&#39;s not judgment I love you

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.380
Caption: foreign

00:12:56.239 --> 00:13:01.078
Caption: some of the lessons that we learned from

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.419
Caption: the pandemic was fatigue despite working

00:13:01.078 --> 00:13:04.859
Caption: from home prior to the pandemic the

00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:05.820
Caption: challenges of the team were shared by

00:13:04.859 --> 00:13:09.000
Caption: the team

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:12.000
Caption: even though we all had unique challenges

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.440
Caption: things like covert fatigue and long

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.059
Caption: covert

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.059
Caption: things that we were not expecting

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.260
Caption: these became things that we shared

00:13:19.979 --> 00:13:24.898
Caption: collectively as a team

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:28.700
Caption: and it became really important for us to

00:13:24.898 --> 00:13:28.700
Caption: share empathy with the rest of the team

00:13:29.219 --> 00:13:33.838
Caption: managing mental spoons there&#39;s some

00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:35.699
Caption: great blogs out there about mental

00:13:33.838 --> 00:13:37.138
Caption: spoons and having how many spoons you

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.239
Caption: have for your day

00:13:37.138 --> 00:13:43.018
Caption: some days you have less spoons because

00:13:39.239 --> 00:13:44.760
Caption: you borrowed from next week&#39;s spoons

00:13:43.018 --> 00:13:46.799
Caption: currently we&#39;re working towards a four

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.239
Caption: day week and we&#39;re doing this for mental

00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:51.778
Caption: health reasons

00:13:48.239 --> 00:13:52.940
Caption: we realize that the last two years have

00:13:51.778 --> 00:13:55.679
Caption: been hard

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.940
Caption: and it&#39;s four day work week with a

00:13:55.679 --> 00:13:58.380
Caption: five-day pay

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.940
Caption: to clarify

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.940
Caption: I&#39;m not undercutting anybody

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:09.299
Caption: the business values are also imperative

00:14:06.838 --> 00:14:10.739
Caption: they have been from day one for me

00:14:09.299 --> 00:14:12.838
Caption: when I walked out of my previous

00:14:10.739 --> 00:14:15.659
Caption: business it was because there was a

00:14:12.838 --> 00:14:17.820
Caption: misalignment with values

00:14:15.659 --> 00:14:19.799
Caption: and I swore that I would make a business

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:22.380
Caption: that was aligned with my values always

00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:24.419
Caption: even as they evolve

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.880
Caption: the people in our business

00:14:24.419 --> 00:14:29.219
Caption: are aligned with our values our clients

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.398
Caption: are aligned with our values

00:14:29.219 --> 00:14:36.199
Caption: we have fired clients this year

00:14:32.398 --> 00:14:36.200
Caption: for not being aligned with our values

00:14:38.099 --> 00:14:44.059
Caption: I want to have a bit of a conversation

00:14:39.719 --> 00:14:44.059
Caption: about the word overachieving

00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:50.760
Caption: say hello to my toxic relationship

00:14:48.838 --> 00:14:53.458
Caption: it&#39;s with this word

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:56.398
Caption: we used to highlight it as really great

00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:58.859
Caption: oh it&#39;s so great such an overachiever

00:14:56.398 --> 00:15:00.719
Caption: with pride

00:14:58.859 --> 00:15:03.299
Caption: and then our newest team member Michael

00:15:00.719 --> 00:15:04.679
Caption: who&#39;s from Melbourne joined

00:15:03.299 --> 00:15:07.559
Caption: and

00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:11.219
Caption: I remember him saying to me oh I want to

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:13.500
Caption: be just like Vernon just like Derek

00:15:11.219 --> 00:15:15.599
Caption: two of her highest overachievers in our

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.638
Caption: business

00:15:15.599 --> 00:15:19.739
Caption: and I realized that our toxic

00:15:17.638 --> 00:15:22.198
Caption: relationship with that word

00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:24.859
Caption: sets the tone for anybody new coming

00:15:22.198 --> 00:15:24.859
Caption: into our business

00:15:25.739 --> 00:15:30.500
Caption: have a think about what you&#39;re setting

00:15:27.479 --> 00:15:30.500
Caption: the tone for new people

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:38.720
Caption: so I&#39;ve probably run under time because

00:15:35.099 --> 00:15:38.719
Caption: I talk very quickly

00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:43.500
Caption: yeah

00:15:40.859 --> 00:15:44.820
Caption: um but my final notes is you might have

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.799
Caption: noticed that I&#39;ve talked about work

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:49.039
Caption: environment and beliefs and structural

00:15:46.799 --> 00:15:51.299
Caption: workplace and pitfalls the remote work

00:15:49.039 --> 00:15:54.299
Caption: but ultimately the core thing is

00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:56.398
Caption: actually about productivity is mental

00:15:54.299 --> 00:15:58.260
Caption: health and wellness and the security of

00:15:56.398 --> 00:16:01.320
Caption: the team

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:03.898
Caption: when the pandemic kicked off one of the

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:06.179
Caption: decisions that I made was to employ my

00:16:03.898 --> 00:16:06.838
Caption: team they were all subcontractors at the

00:16:06.179 --> 00:16:11.119
Caption: time

00:16:06.838 --> 00:16:11.119
Caption: and I employed them I gave them security

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:14.879
Caption: against every single piece of advice I

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:16.799
Caption: was given at the beginning of the

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.500
Caption: pandemic

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:21.719
Caption: every leader I spoke to everyone I spoke

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.278
Caption: to all of my peers

00:16:21.719 --> 00:16:26.278
Caption: all of them

00:16:23.278 --> 00:16:28.198
Caption: said to me I was crazy

00:16:26.278 --> 00:16:29.578
Caption: said to me I was making foolish

00:16:28.198 --> 00:16:31.859
Caption: decisions

00:16:29.578 --> 00:16:33.898
Caption: said to me I was making a lot of risky

00:16:31.859 --> 00:16:36.299
Caption: choices

00:16:33.898 --> 00:16:38.398
Caption: ultimately without my team my business

00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:40.859
Caption: is nothing

00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:43.578
Caption: their wellness and security is the most

00:16:40.859 --> 00:16:43.578
Caption: important thing

00:16:44.099 --> 00:16:48.599
Caption: what it meant was that two years into

00:16:47.099 --> 00:16:52.758
Caption: the pandemic

00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:52.758

Caption: we all have security

00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:59.159
Caption: with us having that security it also

00:16:57.838 --> 00:17:03.018
Caption: meant that our clients have that

00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:03.018
Caption: security we&#39;re not going anywhere

00:17:04.318 --> 00:17:11.219

Caption: for for many many years and I&#39;ve

00:18:34.439 --> 00:18:39.000
Caption: considered catching up at you know

00:18:36.719 --> 00:18:41.579
Caption: regular times very valuable

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.760
Caption: um so um have you guys considered

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:46.859
Caption: catching up let&#39;s say every you know two

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.839
Caption: three months and at a place and work

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:51.058
Caption: together doing a vocation type of thing

00:18:48.839 --> 00:18:51.959
Caption: so so two of our team work on the East

00:18:51.058 --> 00:18:53.038
Caption: Coast

00:18:51.959 --> 00:18:54.959
Caption: yeah

00:18:53.038 --> 00:18:57.798
Caption: at the moment I can&#39;t afford to fly them

00:18:54.959 --> 00:18:57.798
Caption: over every two weeks

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.619
Caption: um I I would love that uh I think two

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:04.619
Caption: weeks would be a big ask because

00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:06.599
Caption: everybody&#39;s got families and life stuff

00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:08.520
Caption: as well to work around

00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:10.199
Caption: um it is an important thing that&#39;s been

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.979
Caption: flagged as something that we would like

00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:15.899
Caption: to do more often absolutely

00:19:12.979 --> 00:19:18.660
Caption: excuses like DDD Perth it&#39;s a great

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.099
Caption: excuse for that

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.340
Caption: um I don&#39;t know if that answers your

00:19:20.099 --> 00:19:22.339
Caption: questions

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.500
Caption: I do think it&#39;s important

00:19:25.558 --> 00:19:30.298
Caption: um if you have a local team catching up

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.819
Caption: with them

00:19:30.298 --> 00:19:36.839
Caption: um I catch up with all of my team once a

00:19:32.819 --> 00:19:39.119
Caption: week online and it is it is it has been

00:19:36.839 --> 00:19:41.339
Caption: enough for the last five years do you

00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:44.038
Caption: guys want to can I add something yeah I

00:19:41.339 --> 00:19:45.599
Caption: I would recommend considering this to

00:19:44.038 --> 00:19:48.659
Caption: everyone so

00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:52.199
Caption: um I was working in Europe a lot and

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:55.200
Caption: um I flew over from from another country

00:19:52.199 --> 00:19:57.899
Caption: to meet the team every four to six weeks

00:19:55.199 --> 00:20:01.380
Caption: because of this uh even before the

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:03.900
Caption: pandemic uh there was uh for myself very

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.058
Caption: important uh you know to catch up and

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.679
Caption: have this to chats and what what you&#39;ve

00:20:06.058 --> 00:20:10.500
Caption: mentioned and I can only you know

00:20:07.678 --> 00:20:12.538
Caption: recommend doing this it&#39;s what you lose

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.239
Caption: at the costs you lose basically for

00:20:12.538 --> 00:20:16.739
Caption: office you should spend in yeah kind of

00:20:15.239 --> 00:20:18.479
Caption: events that&#39;s

00:20:16.739 --> 00:20:21.359
Caption: um so what so what we invested chose to

00:20:18.479 --> 00:20:24.719
Caption: invest in was training at the time

00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:26.819
Caption: um and I think one of the things I have

00:20:24.719 --> 00:20:28.439
Caption: always encouraged from the team is that

00:20:26.819 --> 00:20:30.479
Caption: they engage in community

00:20:28.439 --> 00:20:32.538
Caption: that they find their own local community

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:35.400
Caption: and find their own peers

00:20:32.538 --> 00:20:37.319
Caption: because we don&#39;t know what the pandemic

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:41.280
Caption: will look like in the future we might go

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:43.500
Caption: into another lockdown the like the

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.119
Caption: concern I have is if we go into another

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.099
Caption: lockdown then how do we maintain that

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:49.500
Caption: how do we support that I&#39;d actually

00:20:47.099 --> 00:20:51.418
Caption: agree with that if your team is remote

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.520
Caption: at least find a tribe and that&#39;s

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:55.439
Caption: actually why I&#39;m here at DDD Perth

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.479
Caption: because I&#39;m working remotely in a team

00:20:55.439 --> 00:20:59.819
Caption: of one and I get to connect with amazing

00:20:57.479 --> 00:21:02.359
Caption: people like Ming who invited me here

00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:02.359
Caption: um another question

00:21:03.178 --> 00:21:07.500
Caption: um hi if you feel comfortable can you

00:21:05.099 --> 00:21:09.959
Caption: expand a little bit on the toxic

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.939
Caption: relationship with overachieving how

00:21:09.959 --> 00:21:13.918
Caption: people might recognize that in

00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:16.918
Caption: themselves potentially

00:21:13.918 --> 00:21:19.279
Caption: I think this week has been a good

00:21:16.918 --> 00:21:19.279
Caption: example

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.500
Caption: um

00:21:21.538 --> 00:21:28.259
Caption: I think if you if so specifically to

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:31.439
Caption: people who work remote

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:33.959
Caption: you have on average two to four hours

00:21:31.439 --> 00:21:35.819
Caption: that are actually productive

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:39.289
Caption: productive work

00:21:35.819 --> 00:21:39.839
Caption: the rest of it is spinning wheels

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.619
Caption: [Music]

00:21:39.839 --> 00:21:42.959
Caption: um

00:21:40.619 --> 00:21:46.400
Caption: and I think if you are pushing yourself

00:21:42.959 --> 00:21:48.359
Caption: or drinking lots of Red Bull too

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.700
Caption: caffeine intake is probably a good

00:21:48.359 --> 00:21:53.400
Caption: indicator

00:21:49.699 --> 00:21:56.819
Caption: missing meals there&#39;s another one

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:59.640
Caption: um for me I&#39;m very lucky in the fact

00:21:56.819 --> 00:22:01.798
Caption: that I have a great relationship where

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:05.640
Caption: my partner has got very healthy

00:22:01.798 --> 00:22:07.859
Caption: boundaries with work and home life

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.079
Caption: um and so a lot of that dictates my

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:12.479
Caption: relationship with that when I was single

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:14.760
Caption: I can guarantee you I would work 14

00:22:12.479 --> 00:22:17.880
Caption: hours because sometimes

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.159
Caption: I don&#39;t have a perception of time

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:23.000
Caption: and I think speaking to the

00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:26.520
Caption: neurodiversity side of things

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.380
Caption: certainly this week I don&#39;t always know

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:33.239
Caption: what my Max

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:34.859
Caption: output looks like and it&#39;s taking

00:22:33.239 --> 00:22:38.119
Caption: it&#39;s taken me probably five years to

00:22:34.859 --> 00:22:40.859
Caption: figure out you know maybe do too much

00:22:38.119 --> 00:22:43.678
Caption: I think also being neurodiverse there&#39;s

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:46.319
Caption: something called delay aversion so you

00:22:43.678 --> 00:22:48.058
Caption: procrastinate and then you freak out and

00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:49.500
Caption: you rush to the Finish but you do it

00:22:48.058 --> 00:22:51.599
Caption: successfully and that gives you a

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.880
Caption: dopamine reward and then you repeat the

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:57.020
Caption: behavior and itself

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.020
Caption: um it&#39;s all fulfilling

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:04.519
Caption: I&#39;m getting better at it

00:23:04.678 --> 00:23:09.119
Caption: I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve learned that lesson

00:23:06.839 --> 00:23:10.380
Caption: yet because I&#39;m still saying yes to lots

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:12.538
Caption: of things

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.579
Caption: I mean great job

00:23:12.538 --> 00:23:16.558
Caption: um it&#39;s not so much a question or an

00:23:14.579 --> 00:23:18.839
Caption: observation I think like with the um

00:23:16.558 --> 00:23:21.779
Caption: toxic overachieving uh linking

00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:24.658
Caption: self-worth to achievements as well yeah

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:27.119
Caption: um so not being satisfied with an

00:23:24.659 --> 00:23:29.220
Caption: outcome if there&#39;s the perception of

00:23:27.119 --> 00:23:30.839
Caption: failure you then look at yourself as a

00:23:29.219 --> 00:23:32.640
Caption: failure as opposed to looking at the

00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:35.038
Caption: activity has failed

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:39.058
Caption: um yeah so yeah that can be a big thing

00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:42.000
Caption: I yeah so so just to add to that so with

00:23:39.058 --> 00:23:44.339
Caption: the PTSD side of things a lot of my

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.219
Caption: internal dialogue is around total

00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:49.859
Caption: catastrophic failure

00:23:47.219 --> 00:23:52.079
Caption: um and even this week like little things

00:23:49.859 --> 00:23:54.058
Caption: have gone wrong

00:23:52.079 --> 00:23:55.619
Caption: and my brain has gone oh my God

00:23:54.058 --> 00:23:57.298
Caption: everybody&#39;s gonna hate me it&#39;s going to

00:23:55.619 --> 00:23:58.918
Caption: be the worst experience what&#39;s going on

00:23:57.298 --> 00:24:00.599
Caption: I don&#39;t even know how to do this if I&#39;m

00:23:58.918 --> 00:24:01.558
Caption: going to show up and if I do my talk and

00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:04.918
Caption: I&#39;m not even ready and I haven&#39;t even

00:24:01.558 --> 00:24:06.658
Caption: done my slides and that is constantly in

00:24:04.918 --> 00:24:07.859
Caption: my brain

00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:10.320
Caption: so yeah

00:24:07.859 --> 00:24:11.939
Caption: thank you for putting that into

00:24:10.319 --> 00:24:14.279
Caption: the talk

00:24:11.939 --> 00:24:16.379
Caption: um you mentioned the four day week and

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.539
Caption: I&#39;ve just done articles I&#39;ve read the

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:21.599
Caption: rhetoric is around like

00:24:18.538 --> 00:24:24.298
Caption: in the office you have that water cooler

00:24:21.599 --> 00:24:26.400
Caption: time and a lot so really you can get you

00:24:24.298 --> 00:24:28.380
Caption: know we can compress to a four day week

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.839
Caption: for our current workload for our current

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:33.000
Caption: five-day pay as what sounds like an

00:24:30.839 --> 00:24:35.158
Caption: already efficient team as a business

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.319
Caption: owner if you&#39;re happy to share it do you

00:24:35.159 --> 00:24:39.419
Caption: have any ways you&#39;re working towards

00:24:37.319 --> 00:24:41.339
Caption: that as a remote company to a four day

00:24:39.418 --> 00:24:44.939
Caption: week

00:24:41.339 --> 00:24:47.520
Caption: um so some of it is around figuring out

00:24:44.939 --> 00:24:49.979
Caption: what that work day looks like that day

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:52.260
Caption: off looks like so for some of the team

00:24:49.979 --> 00:24:54.000
Caption: it&#39;s the Monday they don&#39;t they don&#39;t

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.219

Caption: around Community engagement and whether

00:25:04.678 --> 00:25:08.819
Caption: or not they wanted to use that time to

00:25:06.178 --> 00:25:11.339
Caption: engage with their Community

00:25:08.819 --> 00:25:14.479
Caption: um in terms of

00:25:11.339 --> 00:25:14.479
Caption: cost management

00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:18.859
Caption: chargeable for my clients is probably a

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.199
Caption: good start

00:25:18.859 --> 00:25:22.918
Caption: because don&#39;t charge enough

00:25:22.199 --> 00:25:25.918
Caption: um

00:25:22.918 --> 00:25:29.158
Caption: yeah like the costs and certainly

00:25:25.918 --> 00:25:32.038
Caption: employing people and coming out of being

00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:36.059
Caption: a sole Trader into a company

00:25:32.038 --> 00:25:38.459

00:25:38.459 --> 00:25:45.479
Caption: from lead gen to then being okay I&#39;m

00:25:42.298 --> 00:25:47.459
Caption: like my my days is staring at my bank

00:25:45.479 --> 00:25:48.719
Caption: account and making sure that I can

00:25:47.459 --> 00:25:51.839
Caption: afford

00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:54.260
Caption: to operate in the ways that we operate I

00:25:51.839 --> 00:25:56.699
Caption: get zero Joy from that

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:59.520
Caption: the joy I actually get from is is

00:25:56.699 --> 00:26:02.219
Caption: working with my clients so

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.200
Caption: uh it have we got a plan the plan is

00:26:02.219 --> 00:26:05.819
Caption: currently we have some targets to hit

00:26:04.199 --> 00:26:07.979
Caption: for the business so we can financially

00:26:05.819 --> 00:26:10.259
Caption: support it

00:26:07.979 --> 00:26:12.778
Caption: um and then when we start to implement

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:15.419
Caption: it we&#39;re going to do a trial just to get

00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:17.400
Caption: our rhythms right but you&#39;re quite right

00:26:15.418 --> 00:26:20.158
Caption: like the the

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.679
Caption: the amount of work that we do as as like

00:26:20.159 --> 00:26:25.159
Caption: we&#39;re a small team we&#39;ve a team of six

00:26:22.678 --> 00:26:28.979
Caption: the amount of work that we do is

00:26:25.159 --> 00:26:31.080
Caption: overwhelming Kira wrote a really great

00:26:28.979 --> 00:26:33.298
Caption: blog that&#39;s on our website

00:26:31.079 --> 00:26:35.579
Caption: um which was something along the what

00:26:33.298 --> 00:26:37.139
Caption: the ever loving bleep have I got have I

00:26:35.579 --> 00:26:38.939
Caption: gotten him myself into and I think was

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.459
Caption: it like a month into her job

00:26:38.939 --> 00:26:43.019
Caption: a weekend a week into the business

00:26:41.459 --> 00:26:44.399
Caption: yeah

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:47.159
Caption: um and she&#39;s now been in the business

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.739
Caption: for a year and a half I think yeah

00:26:47.159 --> 00:26:51.419
Caption: um and so she sort of reflected on all

00:26:49.739 --> 00:26:54.298
Caption: of the things that we do and she was

00:26:51.418 --> 00:26:55.380
Caption: like oh I had no idea what you guys did

00:26:54.298 --> 00:26:58.500
Caption: like

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.819
Caption: so could I also add I think um what I&#39;ve

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.140
Caption: learned about you is you like to help

00:26:59.819 --> 00:27:04.079
Caption: people yeah

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.520
Caption: and it&#39;s really hard to say nice and you

00:27:04.079 --> 00:27:07.500
Caption: have to retrain the way instead of

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.000
Caption: saying no about what help you can give

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.520
Caption: instead of actually taking it on board

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.038
Caption: and and uh just getting it all done

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.020
Caption: because you achieve so much that you

00:27:14.038 --> 00:27:18.058
Caption: need to actually temper that with um

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:21.359
Caption: prioritizing the right tasks I I

00:27:18.058 --> 00:27:23.099
Caption: recently did a a money mindset training

00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:24.658
Caption: and one of the things that came out of

00:27:23.099 --> 00:27:27.418
Caption: that was

00:27:24.659 --> 00:27:31.919
Caption: um I I have a nurturer money mindset

00:27:27.418 --> 00:27:35.038
Caption: which means that I want to help everyone

00:27:31.918 --> 00:27:37.019
Caption: um except for myself and

00:27:35.038 --> 00:27:38.339
Caption: um so I&#39;d like I do have some boundaries

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.380
Caption: that I&#39;ve put in place that I&#39;ve learned

00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:43.260
Caption: which is like with my community

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:45.058
Caption: engagement stuff limiting to 10 of my

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.839
Caption: time

00:27:45.058 --> 00:27:48.058
Caption: um

00:27:45.839 --> 00:27:49.619
Caption: but yeah so it&#39;s starting to put

00:27:48.058 --> 00:27:51.239
Caption: boundaries in place and stuff like that

00:27:49.619 --> 00:27:53.459
Caption: so

00:27:51.239 --> 00:27:56.400
Caption: with the gradual move towards remote

00:27:53.459 --> 00:27:58.020
Caption: work for more and more businesses a lot

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.479
Caption: of companies seem to have trust issues

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:02.279
Caption: in their management staff trusting their

00:28:00.479 --> 00:28:05.038
Caption: actual staff who do the processing the

00:28:02.279 --> 00:28:07.260
Caption: actual work and do the output so do you

00:28:05.038 --> 00:28:08.579
Caption: have any advice to help those people who

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.159
Caption: do have small businesses that are

00:28:08.579 --> 00:28:13.500
Caption: looking at moving to remote for how to

00:28:11.159 --> 00:28:16.260
Caption: develop that trust relationship as an

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.880
Caption: employer and also for the employees to

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.039
Caption: develop a trust relationship with them

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.719
Caption: because don&#39;t forget if you don&#39;t trust

00:28:20.038 --> 00:28:22.739
Caption: your manager and you&#39;re not in there

00:28:21.719 --> 00:28:24.839
Caption: every day

00:28:22.739 --> 00:28:27.000
Caption: it&#39;s going to go horribly wrong so any

00:28:24.839 --> 00:28:30.119
Caption: advice for businesses looking to do that

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.739
Caption: throw me a curveball Sarah

00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:32.760
Caption: oh yeah thanks

00:28:31.739 --> 00:28:36.079
Caption: um

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:39.298
Caption: um okay so a couple of things one is if

00:28:36.079 --> 00:28:43.979
Caption: employers managers whoever are concerned

00:28:39.298 --> 00:28:46.139
Caption: that their team are not doing their job

00:28:43.979 --> 00:28:49.020
Caption: hire different people

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:51.359
Caption: hire people that you trust if you don&#39;t

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:53.339
Caption: hire people that you don&#39;t trust what

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:55.798
Caption: are you doing and the other way around

00:28:53.339 --> 00:28:57.479
Caption: if you&#39;re looking to find the right team

00:28:55.798 --> 00:28:59.278
Caption: to work in actually figure that out

00:28:57.479 --> 00:29:01.079
Caption: first because yeah it is all too common

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:03.000
Caption: so that kind of comes back to Value

00:29:01.079 --> 00:29:06.839
Caption: alignment

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.760
Caption: um so things like for us the question

00:29:06.839 --> 00:29:10.678
Caption: that I will always ask my team when

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.599
Caption: they&#39;re struggling with something is how

00:29:10.678 --> 00:29:15.418
Caption: can I support you

00:29:12.599 --> 00:29:17.459
Caption: it&#39;s never why didn&#39;t you do this

00:29:15.418 --> 00:29:20.038
Caption: because that&#39;s always going to come back

00:29:17.459 --> 00:29:22.079
Caption: with a point of aggression it&#39;s never

00:29:20.038 --> 00:29:24.178
Caption: that&#39;s never going to be a helpful

00:29:22.079 --> 00:29:24.839
Caption: question

00:29:24.178 --> 00:29:27.239
Caption: um

00:29:24.839 --> 00:29:29.038
Caption: but I&#39;ve also managed people for over 20

00:29:27.239 --> 00:29:32.459
Caption: years so

00:29:29.038 --> 00:29:35.898
Caption: Kyra Kira&#39;s got a question and then oh

00:29:32.459 --> 00:29:35.898
Caption: no one of my team

00:29:36.839 --> 00:29:39.418
Caption: um

00:29:37.918 --> 00:29:41.099
Caption: so

00:29:39.418 --> 00:29:43.139
Caption: men can obviously really answer that

00:29:41.099 --> 00:29:45.599
Caption: from an employer&#39;s point of view but for

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:48.479
Caption: the people who work for her the way that

00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:50.520
Caption: that pans out for us is that

00:29:48.479 --> 00:29:52.380
Caption: I think the most important takeaway for

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.320
Caption: that for employers is don&#39;t deck over

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:57.119
Caption: your stuff yeah because I&#39;ve been in

00:29:55.319 --> 00:29:59.519
Caption: really toxic work environments and I now

00:29:57.119 --> 00:30:02.219
Caption: work for me and I have been in

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.380
Caption: situations where they will say oh great

00:30:02.219 --> 00:30:05.939
Caption: come to us are you okay is everything

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.678
Caption: all right tell us when you have problems

00:30:05.939 --> 00:30:10.798
Caption: and then we&#39;ll use that as an excuse to

00:30:07.678 --> 00:30:13.319
Caption: screw you every time whereas

00:30:10.798 --> 00:30:16.558
Caption: what I&#39;m finding difficult to relax into

00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:18.658
Caption: is the fact that I can actually have a

00:30:16.558 --> 00:30:20.819
Caption: shitty day or have a problem or have

00:30:18.659 --> 00:30:21.899
Caption: something and my boss isn&#39;t trying to

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:24.479
Caption: screw me

00:30:21.899 --> 00:30:27.059
Caption: so I&#39;ll go to Ming and she&#39;ll go okay

00:30:24.479 --> 00:30:29.038
Caption: that&#39;s fine let&#39;s let&#39;s do something

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:31.020
Caption: else today let&#39;s find something else

00:30:29.038 --> 00:30:33.418
Caption: that you can manage or let&#39;s put that on

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:36.479
Caption: the back burner and and you need to take

00:30:33.418 --> 00:30:39.000
Caption: a day exactly the amount of times I&#39;ve

00:30:36.479 --> 00:30:40.619
Caption: said I&#39;m sick and just don&#39;t expect too

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.479
Caption: much from me today and she&#39;s like right

00:30:40.619 --> 00:30:44.339
Caption: you&#39;re going to bed now I&#39;m logging you

00:30:42.479 --> 00:30:46.199
Caption: off

00:30:44.339 --> 00:30:47.939
Caption: it&#39;s just it&#39;s very different for an

00:30:46.199 --> 00:30:50.219
Caption: employee I think to relax into that

00:30:47.939 --> 00:30:53.459
Caption: space I also kind of want to point out

00:30:50.219 --> 00:30:56.880
Caption: that if you are treating your employees

00:30:53.459 --> 00:31:00.658
Caption: like their criminals it makes them very

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:02.880
Caption: kidnappable for a better employer

00:31:00.659 --> 00:31:04.559
Caption: case in point Kira was kidnapped from

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.339
Caption: her last

00:31:04.558 --> 00:31:07.339
Caption: employer

00:31:08.339 --> 00:31:12.239
Caption: um I&#39;ve got a question about the

00:31:10.079 --> 00:31:13.979
Caption: different communication Styles that&#39;s

00:31:12.239 --> 00:31:16.859
Caption: something that I&#39;ve definitely struggled

00:31:13.979 --> 00:31:20.760
Caption: with since starting remote work like uh

00:31:16.859 --> 00:31:24.119
Caption: well uh pandemic wise yeah

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:27.839
Caption: um because I&#39;m more like I talk to speak

00:31:24.119 --> 00:31:30.298
Caption: and some people oh wait no sorry talk to

00:31:27.839 --> 00:31:32.459
Caption: think and some people think to talk yeah

00:31:30.298 --> 00:31:35.939
Caption: and some people think and then right

00:31:32.459 --> 00:31:38.520
Caption: yeah and I really struggle with that so

00:31:35.939 --> 00:31:41.459
Caption: um do you have any tips

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.320
Caption: um if so first of all if you are having

00:31:41.459 --> 00:31:45.298
Caption: a challenging conversation it&#39;s an

00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:47.519
Caption: indicator that the other person is not

00:31:45.298 --> 00:31:51.359
Caption: receiving you the right way

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:53.459
Caption: um and ask ask the other person how the

00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:55.760
Caption: best way is for them to receive that

00:31:53.459 --> 00:31:55.760
Caption: information

00:31:56.159 --> 00:32:00.840
Caption: um is it&#39;s probably one of the best

00:31:58.079 --> 00:32:02.819
Caption: pieces of advice I got when I was

00:32:00.839 --> 00:32:07.140
Caption: learning to be a manager

00:32:02.819 --> 00:32:10.380
Caption: was just communicate with your manager

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:13.140
Caption: what&#39;s going on and explain to them how

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:15.418
Caption: you best a receive information but then

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:18.239
Caption: also try to understand how they receive

00:32:15.418 --> 00:32:21.599
Caption: information so we have team members who

00:32:18.239 --> 00:32:22.558
Caption: will much prefer to have a DOT Point

00:32:21.599 --> 00:32:25.199
Caption: list

00:32:22.558 --> 00:32:27.538
Caption: and like the overview and then there

00:32:25.199 --> 00:32:29.219
Caption: will be team members who want every they

00:32:27.538 --> 00:32:31.439
Caption: all the details they want all the

00:32:29.219 --> 00:32:33.839
Caption: details and the minutia

00:32:31.439 --> 00:32:36.778
Caption: um then there&#39;s me who rolls in and is a

00:32:33.839 --> 00:32:38.158
Caption: verbal communicator and doesn&#39;t like

00:32:36.779 --> 00:32:40.500
