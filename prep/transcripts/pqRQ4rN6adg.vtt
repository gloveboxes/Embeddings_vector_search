Caption: end um i&#39;m a trainer at a company called

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:19.279
Caption: stack mechanics which i&#39;ll talk a little

00:03:16.878 --> 00:03:21.279
Caption: bit about later on essentially to help

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.360
Caption: people you know in larger groups to

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.958
Caption: avoid some of these mistakes

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.000
Caption: uh rambling this is the first time back

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.199
Caption: for a while

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.080
Caption: all right so the agenda today um

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:33.199
Caption: i&#39;m gonna give you a little bit of

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.319
Caption: background and historical context

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.319
Caption: um

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.839
Caption: about uh microservices i&#39;m a big

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.958
Caption: believer that in understanding the

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.080
Caption: history of something you kind of

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.759
Caption: understand

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.440
Caption: what problem it&#39;s solving and you know

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:45.759
Caption: why we might want to do that

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.000
Caption: um i&#39;m going to talk about some of the

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:50.000
Caption: mistakes that i see um and the impact of

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.518
Caption: those mistakes that i&#39;ve seen and then

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.199
Caption: some of the principles and techniques

00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:56.559
Caption: and and thinking

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.559
Caption: and design principles to

00:03:56.878 --> 00:03:59.679
Caption: not make those mistakes

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:01.759
Caption: and i&#39;m going to get into some of the

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:04.000
Caption: sort of tech stack details but um

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:05.039
Caption: essentially it&#39;s more around conceptual

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.199
Caption: stuff

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.199
Caption: so

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.559
Caption: some background

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:17.279
Caption: for a lot of years with with ratify

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:19.279
Caption: and also my solo consulting stuff we&#39;d

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.880
Caption: often kind of go into the burning

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.239
Caption: building

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.919
Caption: rescue stuff

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:27.279
Caption: um and often in those situations um you

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.959
Caption: get to a point where people are like

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:30.320
Caption: well we need guarantees that this is

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:31.759
Caption: going to work and you know we can&#39;t

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.040
Caption: guarantee anything because everything&#39;s

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.119
Caption: on fire

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.559
Caption: so what we started to do you know and

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:39.440
Caption: and you know these sorts of approaches

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:41.839
Caption: over the last 10 12 13 years

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.519
Caption: is you can&#39;t make big promises so what

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:45.119
Caption: we would do is ship something really

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:46.239
Caption: small really quickly and then ship

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:48.160
Caption: something else really small really

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:50.160
Caption: quickly to kind of get some runs on the

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.679
Caption: board and and prove things

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.839
Caption: um

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:56.559
Caption: and you know these patterns that we sort

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:58.239
Caption: of took out of that um

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:59.440
Caption: eventually became you know called micro

00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:01.199
Caption: services

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.399
Caption: and lots of tooling and sort of

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.880
Caption: infrastructure

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:06.639
Caption: like octopus deploy and and serialog and

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.919
Caption: some of the sort of tools that as.net

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.839
Caption: developers have seen most people

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.479
Caption: here.net

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:13.039
Caption: developers

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.239
Caption: about half okay cool um source came out

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.839
Caption: of that space where we&#39;re just like

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:18.160
Caption: getting in as a consultancy and having

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:20.079
Caption: to solve problems really really quickly

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.600
Caption: um

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:23.279
Caption: so

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.039
Caption: that&#39;s part of the background of wire

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.320
Caption: like micro services the other part of

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.799
Caption: this talk is

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.000
Caption: we are in a very hype driven industry

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:32.000
Caption: you would probably know this yes

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:35.440
Caption: and it&#39;s very cyclic as well and sort of

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:38.079
Caption: part of my

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.080
Caption: advantage of being you know in tech for

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:42.799
Caption: 20 something years is you start to see

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:44.319
Caption: the same bad ideas recycle with new

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:46.239
Caption: names and i see a couple of nodes here

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.279
Caption: go yes um

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:48.479
Caption: and

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.000
Caption: you know sometimes

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.600
Caption: those ideas get renamed it was like this

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.279
Caption: is a great new thing and i kind of you

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.720
Caption: know put on my grumpy old man pants i&#39;m

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:56.720
Caption: like no we&#39;ve done that you know

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.199
Caption: and

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.240
Caption: and what happens is

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.679
Caption: everyone&#39;s kind of jumps on these

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:02.959
Caption: bandwagons and they write blog posts

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:04.559
Caption: because everyone wants to kind of get

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:05.759
Caption: noticed for stuff

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:07.039
Caption: and you&#39;ve got blog posts like oh this

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.639
Caption: is an amazing thing and people want to

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.399
Caption: get on hacker news and companies wanted

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.520
Caption: to attract talent you know we&#39;ll do

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:14.319
Caption: posts um about how they how they did

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:16.399
Caption: things

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:18.160
Caption: um my favorite is uber engineering&#39;s

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:19.600
Caption: blog because every couple of years they

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.440
Caption: change everything and write a blog post

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.759
Caption: about it um you know one year was like

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.759
Caption: we&#39;ve moved away from postgres to my

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.199
Caption: sequel because it&#39;s faster and then two

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:29.440
Caption: years later they&#39;ve just finished that

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.880
Caption: migration go well no that was a bad idea

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.039
Caption: we&#39;re going back again

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.479
Caption: um and and that&#39;s kind of fine for uber

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.839
Caption: because they&#39;re massive and they&#39;ve got

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.600
Caption: you know billions of dollars of venture

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:39.359
Caption: capital funding and

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.800
Caption: most of us aren&#39;t uber we don&#39;t we can&#39;t

00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:42.638
Caption: afford to make those mistakes and you

00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:45.519
Caption: know rebuild our database

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:47.600
Caption: every you know two years

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:49.279
Caption: so yeah part of the problem is

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.600
Caption: very hype driven everyone wants to be

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:53.839
Caption: kind of in on the latest thing

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.639
Caption: and we end up with this

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:56.399
Caption: so

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.720
Caption: for anyone who can&#39;t see this well this

00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:00.160
Caption: is a sort of well-known meme um of a dog

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.360
Caption: sitting drinking a coffee with flames

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.199
Caption: all around him i&#39;m saying this is fine

00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:07.839
Caption: and i&#39;m going to repeat this a few times

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:09.360
Caption: so if you sort of can&#39;t see the slides

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:10.880
Caption: and you hear me say this is fine just

00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:13.119
Caption: picture the dog in the burning building

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.319
Caption: thinking that everything&#39;s all good

00:07:13.119 --> 00:07:16.239
Caption: um

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:18.720
Caption: so yeah we built these things and it

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:20.720
Caption: ends up just in in a disaster and as

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.319
Caption: much as i love i actually quite enjoy as

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.039
Caption: a consultant you know going to the

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:26.880
Caption: burning building and picking stuff up i

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:28.239
Caption: it&#39;s a sick satisfaction i get from it

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.399
Caption: it would be great for the entire

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:33.039
Caption: industry if we didn&#39;t do it we didn&#39;t

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:35.359
Caption: set stuff on fire in the first place

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:38.239
Caption: so my goal today is sort of understand

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:39.598
Caption: why we might do micro services um

00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:41.759
Caption: and and some of the thinking we need to

00:07:39.598 --> 00:07:43.359
Caption: do so that we can stop um setting things

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:44.239
Caption: on fire

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:46.079
Caption: all alright

00:07:44.239 --> 00:07:47.759
Caption: so history

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:51.359
Caption: again this is one of these

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:52.799
Caption: everything old is new again um

00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:54.559
Caption: every idea in software is built on

00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:56.319
Caption: something before it solving a problem

00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:58.639
Caption: before it so i want to sort of talk a

00:07:56.319 --> 00:08:00.160
Caption: little bit about

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:01.520
Caption: my version of the history of

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.759
Caption: microservices

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:03.759
Caption: and

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:07.039
Caption: so

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:08.479
Caption: again there&#39;s some assumptions and

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:10.319
Caption: opinions here but i have you know cross

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:12.479
Caption: check this with a few people

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:14.959
Caption: so it started with something called

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:16.878
Caption: sewer service oriented architecture

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:18.799
Caption: if you knowing nods

00:08:16.878 --> 00:08:19.919
Caption: who&#39;s who was around when soul was a

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:22.399
Caption: thing

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:23.919
Caption: yeah a good number good number

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:26.878
Caption: um

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:28.639
Caption: so so it was a cool idea and the idea

00:08:26.878 --> 00:08:32.640
Caption: was that and this is sort of in the

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:34.239
Caption: early 2000s um in the sort of.net space

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.398
Caption: it was like net1

00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:38.158
Caption: soap was the great new thing and web

00:08:36.398 --> 00:08:41.679
Caption: services

00:08:38.158 --> 00:08:41.679
Caption: a few people go oh i remember

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:47.119
Caption: and the idea was good it was you had

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.359
Caption: loosely coupled services

00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:51.440
Caption: that that autonomously managed a

00:08:49.359 --> 00:08:54.000
Caption: business process

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.239
Caption: and you could then build applications

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.760
Caption: based on those services so you know you

00:08:56.239 --> 00:08:59.200
Caption: might have service a and service b and

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.119
Caption: server c and service d and then

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.640
Caption: application a goes well i would like

00:09:01.119 --> 00:09:04.159
Caption: that thing and that thing and that thing

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.838
Caption: and the applications that sit on top of

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:07.359
Caption: the services and big companies could

00:09:05.838 --> 00:09:09.838
Caption: build that services and everything would

00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:09.838
Caption: be great

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.679
Caption: it wasn&#39;t

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:14.479
Caption: because what we&#39;d end up with

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:15.919
Caption: is

00:09:14.479 --> 00:09:17.039
Caption: something that looked a little bit more

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:19.359
Caption: like this

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:21.359
Caption: where every service or every application

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:23.200
Caption: talks to every service and every service

00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:24.719
Caption: talks to every other service and they

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.559
Caption: were usually all sitting on top of a

00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:28.559
Caption: shared database

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:30.080
Caption: and it was just a mess

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:32.080
Caption: and a lot of this was because we got the

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.119
Caption: modeling wrong you know it was meant to

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.040
Caption: be

00:09:33.119 --> 00:09:37.200
Caption: an autonomous business process managed

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:39.838
Caption: by a service but typically it wasn&#39;t um

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.040
Caption: the modelling got wrong and

00:09:39.838 --> 00:09:43.039
Caption: it wasn&#39;t self-contained at all it

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:44.079
Caption: wasn&#39;t autonomous and everything you

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:45.759
Caption: know

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.920
Caption: looked like this and from the last i

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.320
Caption: know a few a few of you have worked on

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:52.320
Caption: this sort of fun um you know i worked on

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.760
Caption: one where you had a data manager service

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.039
Caption: where they&#39;d sort of re-implemented a

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.479
Caption: relational database on top of a

00:09:55.039 --> 00:10:01.278
Caption: relational database over soap

00:09:58.479 --> 00:10:02.880
Caption: and it looked a lot like this and every

00:10:01.278 --> 00:10:05.119
Caption: service needed to start in the right

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.559
Caption: order or the application would not work

00:10:05.119 --> 00:10:08.159
Caption: so then we had a

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:09.760
Caption: service manager run a service or

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:10.879
Caption: something that made sure that things got

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.518
Caption: started

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.359
Caption: in the right way

00:10:13.518 --> 00:10:16.239
Caption: and it was bad

00:10:15.359 --> 00:10:17.679
Caption: so

00:10:16.239 --> 00:10:19.359
Caption: the software industry came up with a

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:22.159
Caption: great solution to this does anyone

00:10:19.359 --> 00:10:22.159
Caption: remember what that was

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.200
Caption: it was the enterprise service bus

00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:29.119
Caption: um

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.600
Caption: which was you know vendors came in we&#39;ll

00:10:29.119 --> 00:10:33.200
Caption: solve these problems um and an

00:10:31.599 --> 00:10:34.958
Caption: enterprise service buses for if i don&#39;t

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.000
Caption: remember they were they were expensive

00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.078
Caption: um

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.679
Caption: they were generally sold on golf courses

00:10:38.078 --> 00:10:43.359
Caption: um to cios and then just put in place

00:10:41.679 --> 00:10:45.119
Caption: this is very triggering for you i can

00:10:43.359 --> 00:10:47.679
Caption: tell you

00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:50.958
Caption: so and again the idea of an enterprise

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:52.880
Caption: service bus wasn&#39;t a bad one so the idea

00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.679
Caption: is that we had our services

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.200
Caption: and

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:56.000
Caption: rather than them all talking to each

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.359
Caption: other

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.278
Caption: they would talk to this enterprise

00:10:57.359 --> 00:11:01.278
Caption: service bus and the applications would

00:10:59.278 --> 00:11:03.278
Caption: talk to the enterprise service bus

00:11:01.278 --> 00:11:06.159
Caption: and the enterprise service bus would

00:11:03.278 --> 00:11:08.640
Caption: figure out where to route requests and

00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:10.319
Caption: how to translate them and whatever else

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.760
Caption: and all of this

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.239
Caption: um

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.320
Caption: logic was in the hands of business

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:18.159
Caption: analysts and enterprise architects and

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.919
Caption: the idea is that the the developers

00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:21.919
Caption: could just cut code on these services

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.518
Caption: the problem was

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.278
Caption: we ended up with so much logic in this

00:11:27.518 --> 00:11:31.039
Caption: service bus

00:11:29.278 --> 00:11:32.159
Caption: that became very fragile because

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:35.759
Caption: essentially you&#39;re doing software

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:37.119
Caption: development in a browser window

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.880
Caption: for biztalk was a browser window that

00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:40.640
Caption: looked a lot like sharepoint

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.838
Caption: writing code in there without

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.519
Caption: validation without testing things

00:11:43.838 --> 00:11:47.200
Caption: and so what happened was it became very

00:11:45.518 --> 00:11:49.359
Caption: fragile so nobody wanted to touch the

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.079
Caption: logic in the enterprise service bus

00:11:49.359 --> 00:11:51.278
Caption: so

00:11:50.078 --> 00:11:53.919
Caption: as

00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:57.719
Caption: agile developers what did we do

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:57.719
Caption: we ratted around it

00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:01.278
Caption: this is fine

00:12:03.838 --> 00:12:07.440
Caption: so

00:12:05.119 --> 00:12:08.398
Caption: what came next and this is my again this

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.919
Caption: is my

00:12:08.398 --> 00:12:11.919
Caption: memory of history and everyone&#39;s memory

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:13.919
Caption: of history is a little bit

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:16.320
Caption: you know

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:18.479
Caption: along came um

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.720
Caption: rest so essentially

00:12:18.479 --> 00:12:22.320
Caption: um there was a guy named jim webber who

00:12:20.719 --> 00:12:23.919
Caption: worked at a company called thoughtworks

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.919
Caption: i&#39;m sure everyone if everyone here has

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:27.440
Caption: heard of thoughtworks yep so again i&#39;m

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:30.320
Caption: jim weber

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.159
Caption: the story goes he was working on some

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.160
Caption: horrible rescue project

00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:36.879
Caption: sitting in a data center

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:39.039
Caption: trying to fix biz talk at one in the

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.880
Caption: morning and just where enough of this is

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:43.599
Caption: terrible so he and a couple of

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.559
Caption: colleagues started to just go we&#39;re not

00:12:43.599 --> 00:12:46.319
Caption: going to put something in this talk

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:49.599
Caption: we&#39;re just going to build a service over

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.200
Caption: here in tomcat and just put an http api

00:12:49.599 --> 00:12:53.199
Caption: on it and and we can call that and just

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.239
Caption: kind of you know

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.559
Caption: um

00:12:54.239 --> 00:12:58.239
Caption: separate some of those functionality up

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:59.518
Caption: and end up writing a book on rest called

00:12:58.239 --> 00:13:01.838
Caption: rest in practice i think really good

00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:03.440
Caption: book on rest and sort of it was around

00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:05.599
Caption: the time that rest sort of became

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.599
Caption: popular and and you know thoughtworks

00:13:05.599 --> 00:13:09.440
Caption: started to do a lot of stuff around

00:13:07.599 --> 00:13:10.559
Caption: these sort of http based services that

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.760
Caption: were simple

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:17.119
Caption: built on i think jetty um and and using

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.119
Caption: rest and hypertext

00:13:17.278 --> 00:13:22.078
Caption: um around the time i first heard the

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.838
Caption: term microservices it was sort of it&#39;s

00:13:22.078 --> 00:13:25.440
Caption: sort of emanating

00:13:23.838 --> 00:13:26.880
Caption: from a company called soundcloud i&#39;m

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.880
Caption: sure a lot of you heard of soundcloud

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.559
Caption: they did audio streaming and downloading

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.720
Caption: stuff

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.719
Caption: so

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:38.559
Caption: um soundcloud had an application it was

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.479
Caption: um it was getting big they were getting

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:42.078
Caption: popular um

00:13:40.479 --> 00:13:45.039
Caption: and it was very monolithic very hard to

00:13:42.078 --> 00:13:46.638
Caption: maintain wasn&#39;t scaling well so they

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:49.039
Caption: hired a bunch of people actually from

00:13:46.638 --> 00:13:50.320
Caption: thoughtworks in berlin

00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:52.078
Caption: and one of the leaders there was a guy

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.760
Caption: named phil calcado

00:13:52.078 --> 00:13:56.479
Caption: and so what they what phil started to do

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.479
Caption: with his team was was break stuff off so

00:13:56.479 --> 00:14:00.239
Caption: had this this big monolithic rails out

00:13:58.479 --> 00:14:02.958
Caption: and they&#39;d break some stuff off build a

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:04.320
Caption: simple http service over it and um you

00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:08.078
Caption: know and a few other people in that

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.760
Caption: space were doing similar things and

00:14:08.078 --> 00:14:11.599
Caption: eventually they became sort of known as

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.639
Caption: microservices

00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:14.559
Caption: so

00:14:12.638 --> 00:14:16.799
Caption: the historical sort of

00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:17.760
Caption: timeline here is you can kind of go from

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:21.440
Caption: sewer

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:23.518
Caption: to bad sewer to http to rest to

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.039
Caption: microservices

00:14:23.518 --> 00:14:26.320
Caption: um and then a guy named sam newman who

00:14:25.039 --> 00:14:27.838
Caption: was also at thoughtworks wrote a book on

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.160
Caption: it which i&#39;m sure a lot of people have

00:14:27.838 --> 00:14:32.398
Caption: seen and it kind of just exploded from

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:32.398
Caption: there

00:14:35.838 --> 00:14:40.638
Caption: but of course we ended up back here

00:14:38.559 --> 00:14:42.239
Caption: where we had lots of services a couple

00:14:40.638 --> 00:14:43.759
Caption: of applications but all the services

00:14:42.239 --> 00:14:46.479
Caption: talking to each other a lot of people

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:50.880
Caption: did it again with a shared database

00:14:46.479 --> 00:14:53.198
Caption: and got the modeling completely wrong

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.198
Caption: and we ended up back here this is fine

00:14:53.198 --> 00:14:56.958
Caption: so who&#39;s worked on one of these

00:14:55.198 --> 00:14:59.440
Caption: in my in microservice land yeah a few

00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.239
Caption: people right

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.559
Caption: so

00:15:00.239 --> 00:15:04.479
Caption: that&#39;s the history so

00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:06.398
Caption: where does it go wrong and this is you

00:15:04.479 --> 00:15:08.078
Caption: know i&#39;ve spent a lot of time

00:15:06.398 --> 00:15:10.239
Caption: digging out of this and thinking about

00:15:08.078 --> 00:15:10.239
Caption: it

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.518
Caption: and

00:15:11.518 --> 00:15:15.518
Caption: the first place that goes wrong

00:15:13.518 --> 00:15:16.719
Caption: is people get way too caught up in the

00:15:15.518 --> 00:15:18.320
Caption: tech

00:15:16.719 --> 00:15:20.078
Caption: yeah and this is a

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.078
Caption: fairly common pattern in our industry

00:15:20.078 --> 00:15:24.799
Caption: you&#39;ve got a problem to solve

00:15:22.078 --> 00:15:26.000
Caption: you start a project everyone&#39;s excited

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:28.398
Caption: you still don&#39;t really know what the

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.359
Caption: business requirements are because that&#39;s

00:15:28.398 --> 00:15:32.719
Caption: someone else&#39;s job as a developer um

00:15:31.359 --> 00:15:34.320
Caption: and so we&#39;re like we&#39;re sitting here we

00:15:32.719 --> 00:15:36.398
Caption: don&#39;t know what to do i know we&#39;ll build

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.359
Caption: our own framework and we&#39;ll build our

00:15:36.398 --> 00:15:41.119
Caption: own orm and we&#39;ll build our whatever and

00:15:39.359 --> 00:15:43.198
Caption: so

00:15:41.119 --> 00:15:44.880
Caption: in in in more recent years people then

00:15:43.198 --> 00:15:46.799
Caption: get really hung up on the infrastructure

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.799
Caption: it&#39;s like right we need to build a thing

00:15:46.799 --> 00:15:51.039
Caption: it&#39;s like cool first we need to do is

00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:53.119
Caption: get kubernetes and put kafka and

00:15:51.039 --> 00:15:54.479
Caption: postgres in kubernetes and just get way

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:56.799
Caption: hung up on the infrastructure before

00:15:54.479 --> 00:15:58.320
Caption: shipping a line of code

00:15:56.799 --> 00:15:59.679
Caption: and essentially you start solving

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.919
Caption: problems that you don&#39;t have yet you

00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:03.119
Caption: don&#39;t know you&#39;re going to have yet

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:04.799
Caption: you know tools are great all of those

00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:06.880
Caption: tools that i mentioned are fantastic

00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:10.159
Caption: tools and fantastic infrastructure but

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.638
Caption: um if you

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:13.440
Caption: start layering on stuff before you&#39;ve

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:15.198
Caption: even

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.198
Caption: understand the problem

00:16:15.198 --> 00:16:18.799
Caption: you probably need to stop

00:16:17.198 --> 00:16:20.078
Caption: and this is kind of agile one-on-one

00:16:18.799 --> 00:16:22.320
Caption: right like we don&#39;t do big design up

00:16:20.078 --> 00:16:24.799
Caption: front a lot of people do it like a map i

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.278
Caption: saw one recently there&#39;s some tool

00:16:24.799 --> 00:16:29.919
Caption: it&#39;s like a graph like a graphing tool

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:32.958
Caption: for sort of object graphs and like a

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:34.239
Caption: team that had not actually shipped

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.159
Caption: the system

00:16:34.239 --> 00:16:38.000
Caption: and the object graph of services was

00:16:36.159 --> 00:16:39.278
Caption: like i couldn&#39;t fit it on my monitor and

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.198
Caption: they&#39;d never actually shipped anything

00:16:39.278 --> 00:16:43.440
Caption: they got way hung up on stuff and just

00:16:41.198 --> 00:16:45.359
Caption: solving problems that you know they

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.958
Caption: didn&#39;t have yet

00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:48.398
Caption: so sometimes when i&#39;m feeling snarky

00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.679
Caption: i&#39;ll say to people if you haven&#39;t

00:16:48.398 --> 00:16:51.599
Caption: shipped one thing

00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:53.440
Caption: what makes you think you can ship 20

00:16:51.599 --> 00:16:55.919
Caption: tomorrow

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.440
Caption: and that makes me popular

00:16:55.919 --> 00:16:58.638
Caption: you know i&#39;ve had this conversation like

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.838
Caption: right we need to start this thing it&#39;s

00:16:58.638 --> 00:17:01.198
Caption: like first thing we need to do is choose

00:16:59.838 --> 00:17:02.719
Caption: a container orchestration platform it&#39;s

00:17:01.198 --> 00:17:04.640
Caption: like well you really don&#39;t you actually

00:17:02.719 --> 00:17:06.000
Caption: have a bunch of stuff over here

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.678
Caption: your legacy system it&#39;s a bunch of

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.038
Caption: servers and you know it&#39;s a proof of

00:17:07.678 --> 00:17:10.640
Caption: concept like let&#39;s see if we can ship a

00:17:09.038 --> 00:17:12.318
Caption: small thing

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.719
Caption: and um you know so people just way hung

00:17:12.318 --> 00:17:14.719
Caption: up on that

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.558
Caption: so

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:20.719
Caption: one of the the

00:17:18.558 --> 00:17:21.760
Caption: attributes i&#39;ve seen of microservices

00:17:20.719 --> 00:17:22.798
Caption: architecture that have been very

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.558
Caption: successful

00:17:22.798 --> 00:17:25.519
Caption: is they&#39;ve evolved from something that

00:17:24.558 --> 00:17:27.760
Caption: worked

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.039
Caption: okay like soundcloud example they had a

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.239
Caption: rails app

00:17:29.038 --> 00:17:32.079
Caption: had traffic

00:17:30.239 --> 00:17:35.199
Caption: they might have even been making money

00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:37.119
Caption: crazy um

00:17:35.199 --> 00:17:38.239
Caption: and

00:17:37.119 --> 00:17:40.479
Caption: you know they started with something and

00:17:38.239 --> 00:17:41.678
Caption: it was creaky and they sort of broke a

00:17:40.479 --> 00:17:42.719
Caption: little bit and started with something

00:17:41.678 --> 00:17:44.880
Caption: that worked

00:17:42.719 --> 00:17:47.760
Caption: and typically those things

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.520
Caption: work quite well here&#39;s a problem let&#39;s

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.280
Caption: take a chunk of it off the ones that

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.799
Caption: start with a blank slate and go cool

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.719
Caption: we&#39;re going to need 30 services

00:17:52.798 --> 00:17:56.479
Caption: typically never ship

00:17:54.719 --> 00:17:57.520
Caption: again because if people have not worked

00:17:56.479 --> 00:17:58.558
Caption: with this stuff before they don&#39;t

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.440
Caption: actually know what challenges they&#39;re

00:17:58.558 --> 00:18:03.760
Caption: going to hit so yeah often good

00:18:01.439 --> 00:18:05.038
Caption: architecture will evolve from good

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.640
Caption: working software or maybe it&#39;s not

00:18:05.038 --> 00:18:08.319
Caption: working well but you&#39;ve got something

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:11.119
Caption: that works you understand it and you

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:13.038
Caption: evolve from there so often the yeah most

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:14.880
Caption: of the successful stories i&#39;ve seen have

00:18:13.038 --> 00:18:15.918
Caption: started from something that was already

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.599
Caption: there

00:18:15.918 --> 00:18:19.839
Caption: and particularly with legacy systems

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:21.280
Caption: i&#39;ve seen a lot of

00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:23.760
Caption: who&#39;s worked on a failed legacy system

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.760
Caption: replacement

00:18:24.319 --> 00:18:28.639
Caption: yeah right and

00:18:26.319 --> 00:18:30.959
Caption: generally they&#39;re like here&#39;s this thing

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.400
Caption: it&#39;s old it&#39;s clunky we don&#39;t like it

00:18:30.959 --> 00:18:33.439
Caption: it&#39;s buggy it&#39;s hard to maintain you&#39;re

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.280
Caption: like cool what we&#39;re going to do is

00:18:33.439 --> 00:18:38.719
Caption: we&#39;re going to start again over here and

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.719
Caption: this time we&#39;re going to do it right

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:44.479
Caption: and you never get there right like you

00:18:41.359 --> 00:18:46.239
Caption: never you never ship it so

00:18:44.479 --> 00:18:47.599
Caption: whenever a new requirement comes in and

00:18:46.239 --> 00:18:49.599
Caption: new requirements always come in they&#39;re

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:51.678
Caption: like well that&#39;s not ready and doesn&#39;t

00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:53.038
Caption: do x y and z so we&#39;ll put it over here

00:18:51.678 --> 00:18:55.038
Caption: and all of a sudden you&#39;re chasing a

00:18:53.038 --> 00:18:56.879
Caption: target you&#39;ll never actually hit yes

00:18:55.038 --> 00:18:58.399
Caption: familiar

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.079
Caption: yeah um

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.440
Caption: legacy system replacements that work

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:03.199
Caption: really well is you&#39;ve got an

00:19:01.439 --> 00:19:04.798
Caption: architecture that lets you sort of move

00:19:03.199 --> 00:19:05.760
Caption: something across at a time and make them

00:19:04.798 --> 00:19:07.119
Caption: talk you know we&#39;ve got this new

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.959
Caption: requirement we&#39;ll put it over here and

00:19:07.119 --> 00:19:10.640
Caption: we&#39;ll integrate it

00:19:08.959 --> 00:19:12.880
Caption: because software is never done

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.440
Caption: you know software is done like a lawn is

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.558
Caption: mode you can mow the line

00:19:15.439 --> 00:19:19.199
Caption: you know the next day you&#39;re going to

00:19:16.558 --> 00:19:20.719
Caption: need to mow it again or the next week so

00:19:19.199 --> 00:19:22.959
Caption: the idea that we&#39;re going to just

00:19:20.719 --> 00:19:24.719
Caption: replace a system turn it on turn the old

00:19:22.959 --> 00:19:28.000
Caption: one off and we&#39;re done yeah it&#39;s just

00:19:24.719 --> 00:19:28.000
Caption: not not a realistic one

00:19:28.719 --> 00:19:32.880
Caption: so now i get to the click bait

00:19:30.719 --> 00:19:34.719
Caption: other than all of that stuff

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:38.400
Caption: the one thing that you need to know for

00:19:34.719 --> 00:19:40.400
Caption: successful microservices architecture

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.559
Caption: is software modelling

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.799
Caption: which you know gets thrown away um

00:19:42.558 --> 00:19:46.719
Caption: modeling is hard like software modelling

00:19:44.798 --> 00:19:48.479
Caption: is hard this is why we have jobs because

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:50.558
Caption: modeling good software is a tricky thing

00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:52.319
Caption: to do and it&#39;s hard to do in one

00:19:50.558 --> 00:19:54.959
Caption: solution you know if you like file a new

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:56.079
Caption: project in your id of choice

00:19:54.959 --> 00:19:56.959
Caption: and you go right we need to solve this

00:19:56.079 --> 00:19:57.760
Caption: problem

00:19:56.959 --> 00:19:59.760
Caption: um

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.959
Caption: it&#39;s hard right like coming up with the

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.160
Caption: design and the modeling is a tricky

00:20:00.959 --> 00:20:06.079
Caption: thing to do and it&#39;s hard in one project

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.760
Caption: if you start with 20 and you need to

00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:09.519
Caption: refactor something

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.239
Caption: you know all of a sudden you&#39;ve just you

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.440
Caption: know multiplied this problem

00:20:12.239 --> 00:20:16.479
Caption: and so

00:20:13.439 --> 00:20:18.479
Caption: what people typically do is

00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:20.798
Caption: spin out all their services

00:20:18.479 --> 00:20:22.239
Caption: 20 of them um

00:20:20.798 --> 00:20:24.239
Caption: and then realize that they&#39;ve not got

00:20:22.239 --> 00:20:25.678
Caption: the modeling right and then you sort of

00:20:24.239 --> 00:20:27.038
Caption: start routing around everything and

00:20:25.678 --> 00:20:28.880
Caption: everything talks to everything else and

00:20:27.038 --> 00:20:29.678
Caption: you know we&#39;re we&#39;re back to that kind

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.239
Caption: of

00:20:29.678 --> 00:20:33.760
Caption: bad sower thing um and then people bring

00:20:32.239 --> 00:20:34.959
Caption: in more infrastructure to solve our

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.558
Caption: services are talking too much let&#39;s

00:20:34.959 --> 00:20:38.158
Caption: bring in a service mesh or poly or

00:20:36.558 --> 00:20:40.000
Caption: something like that

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:42.400
Caption: um

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.239
Caption: so yeah modelling

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.839
Caption: so a couple of common really like common

00:20:44.239 --> 00:20:49.119
Caption: sort of code smells or architecture

00:20:45.839 --> 00:20:49.119
Caption: smells that i see

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.440
Caption: my favorite one is when you&#39;ve got a

00:20:50.798 --> 00:20:56.158
Caption: service for an infrastructure function

00:20:53.439 --> 00:20:59.439
Caption: who has worked on a data service or data

00:20:56.159 --> 00:21:01.360
Caption: manager no good

00:20:59.439 --> 00:21:03.119
Caption: so you know if you&#39;ve got a service that

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:04.479
Caption: are based around sort of infrastructure

00:21:03.119 --> 00:21:07.599
Caption: things you&#39;re probably going to be

00:21:04.479 --> 00:21:09.520
Caption: having a bit of a bad time

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:11.678
Caption: um but the other main one that goes

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.000
Caption: wrong is what gets called the entity

00:21:11.678 --> 00:21:15.760
Caption: service anti-pattern or a service per

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.119
Caption: aggregate

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.880
Caption: did those names just go over everyone&#39;s

00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:21.280
Caption: head or around me

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:24.400
Caption: who&#39;s read this book

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.400
Caption: who&#39;s actually read it

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.719
Caption: who got to the end

00:21:29.678 --> 00:21:35.760
Caption: it is it&#39;s a it&#39;s an amazing book it&#39;s

00:21:31.839 --> 00:21:37.279
Caption: one of the driest books you&#39;ll ever read

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.039
Caption: um

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:41.679
Caption: and and one of the things about this

00:21:39.038 --> 00:21:43.599
Caption: book is actually who does domain driven

00:21:41.678 --> 00:21:44.880
Caption: design

00:21:43.599 --> 00:21:46.479
Caption: a few people you&#39;re hesitant you&#39;re

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.199
Caption: lucky i&#39;m gonna get called out in a sec

00:21:46.479 --> 00:21:49.678
Caption: so

00:21:47.199 --> 00:21:51.279
Caption: you&#39;ve got some repositories

00:21:49.678 --> 00:21:52.399
Caption: some services

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.559
Caption: yeah

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.239
Caption: do you have an on-site business expert

00:21:54.558 --> 00:22:00.000
Caption: that you talk to and develop a custom

00:21:56.239 --> 00:22:02.158
Caption: vocaloid vocab yeah cool excellent um

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Caption: you&#39;re the first one

00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:05.520
Caption: so domain driven design is actually a

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.119
Caption: book around software modeling but nobody

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.799
Caption: gets to that bit because it&#39;s a chapter

00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:10.558
Caption: 15.

00:22:08.798 --> 00:22:12.719
Caption: people get through the first few

00:22:10.558 --> 00:22:15.038
Caption: chapters around services and repository

00:22:12.719 --> 00:22:16.719
Caption: pattern and blah blah blah blah

00:22:15.038 --> 00:22:18.479
Caption: and naming your functions really long

00:22:16.719 --> 00:22:19.599
Caption: things and then never get to the final

00:22:18.479 --> 00:22:21.439
Caption: chapters

00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:23.038
Caption: and eric evans actually i saw him give a

00:22:21.439 --> 00:22:24.719
Caption: talk about

00:22:23.038 --> 00:22:26.719
Caption: um about this book and he went if i had

00:22:24.719 --> 00:22:28.319
Caption: my time again i would just like change

00:22:26.719 --> 00:22:32.558
Caption: the order of the chapters because nobody

00:22:28.319 --> 00:22:32.558
Caption: actually gets to the to the meaty bit

00:22:35.199 --> 00:22:38.798
Caption: so

00:22:36.479 --> 00:22:40.479
Caption: you know if you&#39;re modeling software

00:22:38.798 --> 00:22:42.239
Caption: you might have a customer an order and a

00:22:40.479 --> 00:22:43.038
Caption: shopping cart and catalog pricing things

00:22:42.239 --> 00:22:46.079
Caption: like that when you&#39;re doing your

00:22:43.038 --> 00:22:46.079
Caption: modeling and

00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:49.919
Caption: that&#39;s called an entity or an aggregate

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Caption: route in in domain driven design right

00:22:49.918 --> 00:22:53.279
Caption: so often what we see is services that

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.400
Caption: look like this and you can go and look

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.400
Caption: like microsoft best practice

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.919
Caption: microservices you get something that

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.359
Caption: looks a lot like this and all of a

00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:02.639
Caption: sudden we&#39;ve got a service for every

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:05.520
Caption: entity in our in our model yeah

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.119
Caption: does anyone remember javale loewy

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.119
Caption: early nope cool

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:10.079
Caption: early so uh

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:11.280
Caption: said

00:23:10.079 --> 00:23:13.678
Caption: and everyone thought this was a very

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:16.080
Caption: outlandish thing to say but javale louis

00:23:13.678 --> 00:23:17.918
Caption: said that that in a good service

00:23:16.079 --> 00:23:19.199
Caption: oriented architecture every class would

00:23:17.918 --> 00:23:20.558
Caption: be a service

00:23:19.199 --> 00:23:22.399
Caption: and everyone laughed so this was a

00:23:20.558 --> 00:23:24.079
Caption: ridiculous thing to say but we&#39;ve kind

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.679
Caption: of ended up here

00:23:24.079 --> 00:23:30.640
Caption: again this is my grumpy old man showing

00:23:27.678 --> 00:23:32.640
Caption: so what happens is you know software

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.880
Caption: there&#39;s a couple of

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:38.239
Caption: principles of good software design

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:41.039
Caption: around um like loose coupling and and

00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:42.719
Caption: cohesion and

00:23:41.038 --> 00:23:45.759
Caption: the software to collaborate within its

00:23:42.719 --> 00:23:48.239
Caption: design needs you know cohesion and if

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:51.199
Caption: we&#39;ve split it too far apart then all of

00:23:48.239 --> 00:23:53.439
Caption: a sudden you know

00:23:51.199 --> 00:23:56.000
Caption: we&#39;re talking too much over you know

00:23:53.439 --> 00:23:56.879
Caption: http

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.959
Caption: and

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.798
Caption: you know then you have to deal with

00:23:58.959 --> 00:24:03.439
Caption: distributed computing

00:24:00.798 --> 00:24:05.119
Caption: a lot you know because software is

00:24:03.439 --> 00:24:06.479
Caption: cohesive all these things talk to each

00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:07.918
Caption: other and if all of a sudden you&#39;re

00:24:06.479 --> 00:24:09.520
Caption: talking to each other over a network

00:24:07.918 --> 00:24:11.439
Caption: boundary then you know again you&#39;ve got

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.839
Caption: all sorts of problems

00:24:11.439 --> 00:24:15.678
Caption: and so what i see is services just are

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:16.959
Caption: way too chatty does anyone kind of work

00:24:15.678 --> 00:24:18.798
Caption: on microservices architecture that&#39;s

00:24:16.959 --> 00:24:19.599
Caption: just way too chatty

00:24:18.798 --> 00:24:21.760
Caption: because then you bring in more

00:24:19.599 --> 00:24:23.199
Caption: infrastructure you bring in you know

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.719
Caption: istio and

00:24:23.199 --> 00:24:27.119
Caption: um

00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:28.798
Caption: side car services and service meshes and

00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:30.719
Caption: things like that to solve the fact that

00:24:28.798 --> 00:24:33.599
Caption: we&#39;ve just split our design way too

00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:36.558
Caption: early and our boundaries are done

00:24:33.599 --> 00:24:36.558
Caption: way way too early

00:24:37.918 --> 00:24:43.439
Caption: so some of the symptoms of that

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.439
Caption: when you see it is

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.000
Caption: massive amounts of shared code

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.320
Caption: so then we go okay all of our services

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.959
Caption: need the same classes in there so okay

00:24:50.319 --> 00:24:55.759
Caption: we need a mono repo or or worse still we

00:24:52.959 --> 00:24:57.359
Caption: have everything in one giant solution

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.159
Caption: and i&#39;ve seen that like 20 micro

00:24:57.359 --> 00:25:01.678
Caption: services in one visual studio solution

00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:04.559
Caption: because they need

00:25:01.678 --> 00:25:06.000
Caption: so much shared code

00:25:04.558 --> 00:25:07.599
Caption: and then you have back to the problem

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.359
Caption: that we had in you know the early 2000s

00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:11.199
Caption: which is you need to deploy everything

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:13.119
Caption: in exactly the same order

00:25:11.199 --> 00:25:15.038
Caption: because you&#39;ve got four services with

00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:16.558
Caption: the same classes and if those classes

00:25:15.038 --> 00:25:18.079
Caption: don&#39;t match

00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:19.839
Caption: you&#39;ve got all sorts of errors so then

00:25:18.079 --> 00:25:21.519
Caption: you know everything has to be deployed

00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:23.038
Caption: at exactly the same times they&#39;re not

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.440
Caption: autonomous anymore

00:25:23.038 --> 00:25:27.038
Caption: um when i was at octopus deploy one of

00:25:25.439 --> 00:25:28.399
Caption: the things that we did at octopus and

00:25:27.038 --> 00:25:30.879
Caption: they still do is pretty much everyone

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.119
Caption: does a rotation on customer support

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.719
Caption: which is if you&#39;ve never done it it&#39;s an

00:25:33.119 --> 00:25:36.479
Caption: amazing way to develop empathy for your

00:25:34.719 --> 00:25:38.319
Caption: customer

00:25:36.479 --> 00:25:40.640
Caption: and you make design decisions and then

00:25:38.319 --> 00:25:42.000
Caption: see the impact of that by figuring out

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.000
Caption: what&#39;s hard for people to do and where

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.599
Caption: they get it wrong it&#39;s an amazingly

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.839
Caption: amazing process for kind of building

00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:50.000
Caption: empathy when you&#39;re within your team

00:25:47.839 --> 00:25:50.719
Caption: so people would would write in or email

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.079
Caption: in

00:25:50.719 --> 00:25:54.400
Caption: write in

00:25:52.079 --> 00:25:56.319
Caption: and they&#39;d say octopus doesn&#39;t support

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.320
Caption: microservices

00:25:56.319 --> 00:26:00.079
Caption: what do you mean it&#39;s like we have all

00:25:58.319 --> 00:26:02.479
Caption: of our services each one&#39;s its own

00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:06.079
Caption: project but we need all the projects to

00:26:02.479 --> 00:26:07.678
Caption: be deployed at exactly the same time

00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:09.359
Caption: right

00:26:07.678 --> 00:26:10.798
Caption: so what this gets snarkily called is you

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:12.400
Caption: don&#39;t have microservices you have a

00:26:10.798 --> 00:26:15.439
Caption: distributed monolith

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:18.400
Caption: which is kind of the worst of

00:26:15.439 --> 00:26:19.678
Caption: the worst of all of those worlds um

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.239
Caption: and then again we start adding

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:23.760
Caption: infrastructure to it

00:26:22.239 --> 00:26:25.199
Caption: so

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.558
Caption: for those of you who got through 15

00:26:25.199 --> 00:26:28.239
Caption: chapters of the domain driven design

00:26:26.558 --> 00:26:29.520
Caption: book

00:26:28.239 --> 00:26:31.439
Caption: there&#39;s a concept called a bounded

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.799
Caption: context

00:26:31.439 --> 00:26:34.879
Caption: and

00:26:32.798 --> 00:26:36.798
Caption: again this is a book about modeling and

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.199
Caption: and you start speaking to experts within

00:26:36.798 --> 00:26:41.278
Caption: the business and you develop a shared

00:26:39.199 --> 00:26:42.959
Caption: vocabulary and

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:44.880
Caption: in chapter 15 of the domain driven

00:26:42.959 --> 00:26:47.199
Caption: design book

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.400
Caption: eric evans says that if you start to

00:26:47.199 --> 00:26:49.839
Caption: notice that

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.320
Caption: different groups of people in the

00:26:49.839 --> 00:26:53.678
Caption: business start using words differently

00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:56.079
Caption: or talking about something with a

00:26:53.678 --> 00:26:57.918
Caption: different phrase that&#39;s a bounded

00:26:56.079 --> 00:26:59.038
Caption: context yeah

00:26:57.918 --> 00:27:00.479
Caption: um

00:26:59.038 --> 00:27:01.678
Caption: and you find that you know if anyone

00:28:23.199 --> 00:28:26.158
Caption: project deadline we&#39;ve got our legacy

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.399
Caption: system replacement it&#39;s due to go live

00:28:26.159 --> 00:28:29.760
Caption: next month no you can&#39;t go on holiday

00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:31.520
Caption: which is exactly why you need to go on

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.359
Caption: holiday um

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.080
Caption: you might call a travel agent to you

00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:37.199
Caption: know book you a flight um and a hotel so

00:28:36.079 --> 00:28:38.719
Caption: they&#39;re gonna have a completely

00:28:37.199 --> 00:28:40.319
Caption: different set of words and different

00:28:38.719 --> 00:28:43.038
Caption: like lens and different framing of your

00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:45.759
Caption: holiday it&#39;s all the same thing

00:28:43.038 --> 00:28:47.519
Caption: but everybody has a completely different

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.760
Caption: set of terminology and way of thinking

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.719
Caption: about framing your holiday and and

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.880
Caption: that&#39;s about a context yeah

00:28:52.719 --> 00:28:54.880
Caption: so

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.200
Caption: so bounded context around the people

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:04.159
Caption: involved in something and and the

00:29:01.199 --> 00:29:04.158
Caption: interactions with it

00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:09.918
Caption: okay so

00:29:07.678 --> 00:29:12.558
Caption: if you think about building services you

00:29:09.918 --> 00:29:14.880
Caption: can start to use that framing around

00:29:12.558 --> 00:29:16.479
Caption: water services so if you&#39;ve got a

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.039
Caption: bounded context you know well we look at

00:29:16.479 --> 00:29:20.398
Caption: this thing and it means this to us

00:29:19.038 --> 00:29:23.278
Caption: that might be a really good place to

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:25.360
Caption: start with a service yeah

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:27.360
Caption: and then what you can do is model the

00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:29.678
Caption: communication across the people in this

00:29:27.359 --> 00:29:31.918
Caption: organization and

00:29:29.678 --> 00:29:33.918
Caption: how they communicate that stuff and that

00:29:31.918 --> 00:29:35.199
Caption: becomes in a really good shape of of

00:29:33.918 --> 00:29:37.199
Caption: what your service looks like and what

00:29:35.199 --> 00:29:38.880
Caption: that sort of bounded context looks like

00:29:37.199 --> 00:29:41.278
Caption: so you know

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.520
Caption: um

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:45.200
Caption: if somebody says in your organization

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.200
Caption: go do this

00:29:45.199 --> 00:29:48.880
Caption: that&#39;s a that&#39;s called a command

00:29:47.199 --> 00:29:50.880
Caption: or if somebody else sits there and they

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.319
Caption: wait for wait to be told about something

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.159
Caption: that&#39;s an event and we can start to

00:29:52.319 --> 00:29:57.599
Caption: model then commands and events and

00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:57.600
Caption: requests within an organization

00:29:58.399 --> 00:30:01.760
Caption: so

00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:03.359
Caption: to put an example on that

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:06.000
Caption: think about

00:30:03.359 --> 00:30:07.918
Caption: a really bad restaurant

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.520
Caption: imagine turning up to a restaurant and

00:30:07.918 --> 00:30:10.798
Caption: you sit down with your friends

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.279
Caption: and

00:30:10.798 --> 00:30:14.719
Caption: a waiter comes up with a menu board with

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:17.440
Caption: no prices on it

00:30:14.719 --> 00:30:18.798
Caption: let&#39;s go here are the things

00:30:17.439 --> 00:30:20.558
Caption: and you&#39;d say

00:30:18.798 --> 00:30:22.319
Caption: um

00:30:20.558 --> 00:30:23.199
Caption: how much is the burger and they just run

00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:26.000
Caption: away

00:30:23.199 --> 00:30:27.439
Caption: and come back and go that&#39;s you know 12

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.959
Caption: and you go

00:30:27.439 --> 00:30:30.398
Caption: i&#39;ll have a burger thanks and they go

00:30:28.959 --> 00:30:32.158
Caption: okay

00:30:30.399 --> 00:30:33.840
Caption: i&#39;ll just check if we have them

00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:35.039
Caption: and they run back into the kitchen come

00:30:33.839 --> 00:30:36.558
Caption: back and go yes you can have a burger

00:30:35.038 --> 00:30:39.359

Caption: and like hang on

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.200
Caption: and they run back

Caption: into the kitchen a few minutes later

00:30:43.199 --> 00:30:46.398
Caption: come back and we don&#39;t have fish

00:30:46.558 --> 00:30:49.278

Caption: have some pizza they run back in and

00:30:51.199 --> 00:30:53.678
Caption: they go through this process of like

00:30:52.479 --> 00:30:55.520
Caption: running back in and checking if they

00:30:53.678 --> 00:30:56.880
Caption: have it for all of the food and all of

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.279
Caption: the drinks for every single person at

00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:10.640
Caption: okay here&#39;s the card and they walk and

Caption: they stand in line behind all the other

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.200
Caption: staff in one line to get to the one fps

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:18.239
Caption: machine payment gateways are hard and

00:31:15.199 --> 00:31:20.880
Caption: eventually they get there

00:31:18.239 --> 00:31:22.479
Caption: process your card and it&#39;s declined so

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.678

00:31:22.479 --> 00:31:25.119
Caption: declined you&#39;re ah that&#39;s right gotta

00:31:23.678 --> 00:31:26.959
Caption: put money on that account you transfer

00:31:25.119 --> 00:31:29.119
Caption: some money over and they go and get back

00:31:26.959 --> 00:31:30.239
Caption: in the line

00:31:29.119 --> 00:31:31.918
Caption: and you&#39;re sitting there at this point

00:31:30.239 --> 00:31:33.199
Caption: you&#39;re hungry you&#39;re grumpy

00:31:31.918 --> 00:31:34.558
Caption: because this order still hasn&#39;t gone to

00:31:33.199 --> 00:31:36.398
Caption: the kitchen because you haven&#39;t paid for

00:31:34.558 --> 00:31:38.239
Caption: it yet they come back and go yes that

00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:40.080
Caption: was successful and then they go into the

00:31:38.239 --> 00:31:42.479
Caption: kitchen to place your order and then

00:31:40.079 --> 00:31:44.079
Caption: just disappear you don&#39;t see them again

00:31:42.479 --> 00:31:46.719
Caption: for a long time

00:31:44.079 --> 00:31:48.398
Caption: and you realize that all the white staff

00:31:46.719 --> 00:31:49.839
Caption: are walking into the kitchen

00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:51.440
Caption: and not coming out until they have the

00:31:49.839 --> 00:31:54.158
Caption: food

00:31:51.439 --> 00:31:56.000
Caption: yeah so eventually your waiter comes out

00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:57.279
Caption: um

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.199
Caption: gives you food and you and you eat the

00:31:57.279 --> 00:32:01.200
Caption: field eat the meal at that point you

00:31:59.199 --> 00:32:03.199
Caption: know you&#39;re having a bad time it&#39;s not

00:32:01.199 --> 00:32:05.760
Caption: it&#39;s not a great dining experience one

00:32:03.199 --> 00:32:07.439
Caption: star would not do again

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.558
Caption: um and this company is not going to last

00:32:07.439 --> 00:32:10.079
Caption: too long because they&#39;re going to need

00:32:08.558 --> 00:32:11.119
Caption: way too many staff

00:32:10.079 --> 00:32:13.359
Caption: they&#39;re going to go through the staff

00:32:11.119 --> 00:32:15.359
Caption: because everyone&#39;s rude to them

00:32:13.359 --> 00:32:17.439
Caption: and it just it&#39;s not going to scale

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:18.640
Caption: right

00:32:17.439 --> 00:32:20.639
Caption: has anyone been to this restaurant it

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.558
Caption: sounds pretty bad

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:27.799
Caption: this is how we build systems this is how

00:32:22.558 --> 00:32:27.798
Caption: a lot of people build software um

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.959
Caption: because you know coming back to this

00:32:29.199 --> 00:32:32.319
Caption: kind of

00:32:30.959 --> 00:32:34.239
Caption: sort of canonical microservice

00:32:32.319 --> 00:32:35.278
Caption: architecture that you see it looks like

00:32:34.239 --> 00:32:37.199
Caption: this

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:39.679
Caption: and we&#39;ve got all these http requests

00:32:37.199 --> 00:32:41.278
Caption: now what&#39;s something about http requests

00:32:39.678 --> 00:32:43.038
Caption: they&#39;re synchronous

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:44.399
Caption: okay and so we build this stuff and this

00:32:43.038 --> 00:32:46.000
Caption: is kind of how we build this restaurant

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:47.600
Caption: like i would like to do this i will go

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.279
Caption: check the pricing service like literally

00:32:47.599 --> 00:32:51.038
Caption: every micro service kind of beginning

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:52.159
Caption: article has a cart service and a pricing

00:32:51.038 --> 00:32:53.439
Caption: service

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:54.799
Caption: and that&#39;s like the way to holding the

00:32:53.439 --> 00:32:58.158
Caption: board and then going have to ask the

00:32:54.798 --> 00:32:58.158
Caption: manager how much the burger is

00:32:58.479 --> 00:33:01.359
Caption: and it&#39;s bad this is how we build

00:33:00.079 --> 00:33:02.398
Caption: systems

00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:05.678
Caption: so

00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:05.679
Caption: let&#39;s think about a better restaurant

00:33:05.839 --> 00:33:09.678
Caption: you walk in you sit down the staff hands

00:33:08.159 --> 00:33:11.200
Caption: you out some menus the menus have prices

00:33:09.678 --> 00:33:13.038
Caption: on the menus have specials on them

00:33:11.199 --> 00:33:15.278
Caption: because somebody sat down when those

00:33:13.038 --> 00:33:16.719
Caption: prices changed created a menu and put it

00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:18.320
Caption: on there you sit down and they go

00:33:16.719 --> 00:33:19.678
Caption: actually look i just the kitchen just

00:33:18.319 --> 00:33:21.038
Caption: told me we&#39;ve just run out of fish so

00:33:19.678 --> 00:33:22.239
Caption: that one&#39;s not in there you know okay

00:33:21.038 --> 00:33:24.239
Caption: cool that&#39;s fine i&#39;ll order something

00:33:22.239 --> 00:33:25.599
Caption: else

00:33:24.239 --> 00:33:28.158
Caption: you sit there and you go and here&#39;s the

00:33:25.599 --> 00:33:29.518
Caption: order and the stuff you know right the

00:33:28.159 --> 00:33:31.840
Caption: food on one slip and the drinks on

00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:33.440
Caption: another slip and

00:33:31.839 --> 00:33:36.479
Caption: they you know take one slip to the

00:33:33.439 --> 00:33:38.558
Caption: kitchen another one to the bar and your

00:33:36.479 --> 00:33:41.839
Caption: orders in all easy

00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:43.599
Caption: and then after a few minutes um

00:33:41.839 --> 00:33:45.839
Caption: bell rings at the kitchen

00:33:43.599 --> 00:33:47.439
Caption: okay and some staff go over to see what

00:33:45.839 --> 00:33:49.439
Caption: the bell was for it&#39;s like okay table

00:33:47.439 --> 00:33:51.199
Caption: ten food&#39;s ready and they bring

00:33:49.439 --> 00:33:52.879
Caption: to your table and you sit down and eat

00:33:51.199 --> 00:33:55.119
Caption: it

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.119
Caption: and

00:33:55.839 --> 00:33:59.678
Caption: when it&#39;s time to go you go up and you

00:33:57.519 --> 00:34:01.200
Caption: pay like to pay for table 10 again you

00:33:59.678 --> 00:34:04.158
Caption: might still have the f problem but it&#39;s

00:34:01.199 --> 00:34:05.918
Caption: easy you know just just kind of solve it

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:07.039
Caption: and meanwhile you&#39;ve got a restaurant

00:34:05.918 --> 00:34:08.719
Caption: manager who&#39;s sitting there kind of

00:34:07.038 --> 00:34:10.800
Caption: overseeing like this table got their

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:12.878
Caption: food on time is anyone waiting too long

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.479
Caption: is everything kind of working as it is

00:34:12.878 --> 00:34:16.638
Caption: right

00:34:14.479 --> 00:34:17.678
Caption: that&#39;s a better restaurant because

00:34:16.638 --> 00:34:19.199
Caption: you&#39;ve got

00:34:17.678 --> 00:34:20.800
Caption: um

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:22.398
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s fewer staff and they&#39;re

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.520
Caption: getting more done

00:34:22.398 --> 00:34:25.678
Caption: because

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.199
Caption: they&#39;re not relying on waiting for

00:34:25.678 --> 00:34:28.638
Caption: answers all the time

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:29.678
Caption: they take your order into the kitchen

00:34:28.638 --> 00:34:30.799
Caption: they say

00:34:29.678 --> 00:34:31.918
Caption: make this

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.599
Caption: yeah

00:34:31.918 --> 00:34:36.319
Caption: and when it&#39;s ready someone rings a belt

00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:37.839
Caption: and they come and get it

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:41.440
Caption: one&#39;s a command

00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:43.359
Caption: another one&#39;s an event yeah

00:34:41.439 --> 00:34:44.959
Caption: and so

00:34:43.358 --> 00:34:46.239
Caption: the way these like it&#39;s the same

00:34:44.959 --> 00:34:47.199
Caption: activities they&#39;re still ordering food

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:48.320
Caption: and they&#39;re still cooking food and

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:50.239
Caption: they&#39;re still bringing still paying but

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.719
Caption: it&#39;s the way those activities are

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:54.638
Caption: are grouped and who&#39;s in charge of it

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:56.959
Caption: and how the communication happens is

00:34:54.638 --> 00:34:59.679
Caption: better modeling yeah does anyone go and

00:34:56.959 --> 00:35:01.118
Caption: watch businesses and just like think

00:34:59.679 --> 00:35:02.559
Caption: about the systems you know like

00:35:01.118 --> 00:35:04.559
Caption: massively into systems thinking and you

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.719
Caption: look at that and go if that person did

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.800
Caption: that job everything would go better yeah

00:35:06.719 --> 00:35:11.520
Caption: it&#39;s great great people watching

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.359
Caption: i can&#39;t help myself um and and it&#39;s

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.199
Caption: modeling right

00:35:13.358 --> 00:35:16.559
Caption: and so in this restaurant the staff know

00:35:15.199 --> 00:35:18.479
Caption: when something&#39;s run out

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.320
Caption: they&#39;ve got the prices of stuff

00:35:18.479 --> 00:35:22.000
Caption: the kitchen knows when to make something

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.760
Caption: you don&#39;t have

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.040
Caption: a waiter standing in the kitchen going

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.239
Caption: is it ready yet is it ready yet is it

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.560
Caption: ready yet is it ready yet is it ready

00:35:26.239 --> 00:35:30.079
Caption: yet you know someone rings a bell okay

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.920
Caption: good modeling and this is a good

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:33.760
Caption: restaurant you leave from this

00:35:31.919 --> 00:35:36.000
Caption: good experience five star would eat

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.000
Caption: again

00:35:37.358 --> 00:35:41.039
Caption: so

00:35:39.118 --> 00:35:43.760
Caption: what can we take from this

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.199
Caption: chains of requests do not scale well

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.479
Caption: yeah they&#39;re not worked in a company

00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:48.399
Caption: where to get anything done you have to

00:35:46.479 --> 00:35:50.320
Caption: ask your manager and they asked their

00:35:48.399 --> 00:35:51.598
Caption: manager and then they asked kind of a

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.640
Caption: sideways and it goes down and you&#39;re

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:55.119
Caption: sitting there and you&#39;re like couldn&#39;t

00:35:52.639 --> 00:35:57.519
Caption: i&#39;ve just gone and talked to them

00:35:55.118 --> 00:35:58.399
Caption: it doesn&#39;t scale um it&#39;s not a fun place

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.399
Caption: to work

00:35:58.399 --> 00:36:02.959
Caption: the chains of requests do not scale

00:36:00.399 --> 00:36:04.239
Caption: there&#39;s not a way to get things done

00:36:02.959 --> 00:36:07.520
Caption: people that have the information to do

00:36:04.239 --> 00:36:10.079
Caption: their job are a lot more effective at it

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:13.119
Caption: um again these are kind of fairly

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:13.119
Caption: commonly known things

00:36:13.199 --> 00:36:16.078
Caption: but software

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:18.559
Caption: boundaries that follow these same

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:20.400
Caption: principles tend to work better and a lot

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.479
Caption: of it is around synchronicity so you

00:36:20.399 --> 00:36:24.719
Caption: know synchronous things where you&#39;re

00:36:22.479 --> 00:36:26.159
Caption: waiting for an answer don&#39;t scale and

00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:27.760
Caption: don&#39;t kind of work as well as things

00:36:26.159 --> 00:36:28.719
Caption: that are asynchronous

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.679
Caption: again

00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:32.719
Caption: ring the bell the food&#39;s ready

00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:34.639
Caption: so

00:36:32.719 --> 00:36:36.959
Caption: applying this to services if a service

00:36:34.639 --> 00:36:38.479
Caption: knows enough to do its job

00:36:36.959 --> 00:36:40.399
Caption: then it&#39;s going to scale better it&#39;s

00:36:38.479 --> 00:36:41.679
Caption: going to work better so

00:36:40.399 --> 00:36:44.159
Caption: i have a i have a cute name for this

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:45.219
Caption: which is human shaped microservices

00:36:44.159 --> 00:36:47.520
Caption: trademark

00:36:45.219 --> 00:36:48.399
Caption: [Laughter]

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.679
Caption: um

00:36:48.399 --> 00:36:52.399
Caption: so you know when i look at it when i

00:36:49.679 --> 00:36:55.118
Caption: look at a a software system and kind of

00:36:52.399 --> 00:36:57.279
Caption: try to bring it down to well if people

00:36:55.118 --> 00:36:59.118
Caption: were doing it

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.599
Caption: who would the people be what would they

00:36:59.118 --> 00:37:02.559
Caption: be in charge of um how would they do

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:05.119
Caption: that thing and how would they

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.839
Caption: communicate it so what would people do

00:37:05.118 --> 00:37:09.279
Caption: if we were building this system out of

00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:11.359
Caption: people and

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.719
Caption: again synchronous chains of people

00:37:11.358 --> 00:37:13.679
Caption: asking a question going what&#39;s the

00:37:12.719 --> 00:37:15.358
Caption: answer what&#39;s the answer what&#39;s the

00:37:13.679 --> 00:37:17.919
Caption: answer it&#39;s not a good it&#39;s not you know

00:37:15.358 --> 00:37:19.199
Caption: an effective business to to be in so you

00:37:17.919 --> 00:37:22.799
Caption: look at well if you&#39;re going to group

00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:22.800
Caption: this and have people doing those jobs

00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:27.439
Caption: how would you organize that company to

00:37:25.439 --> 00:37:28.319
Caption: be effective

00:37:27.439 --> 00:37:31.679
Caption: and

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.880
Caption: then build the systems the same way

00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:34.559
Caption: so a really good technique for this

00:37:32.879 --> 00:37:36.479
Caption: something called event storming has

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.239
Caption: anyone seen event storming some kind of

00:37:36.479 --> 00:37:40.479
Caption: a modeling technique where you

00:37:38.239 --> 00:37:42.320
Caption: get post-it notes on a board and

00:37:40.479 --> 00:37:44.479
Caption: and you say well

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.400
Caption: if we were doing this you know i would

00:37:44.479 --> 00:37:48.320
Caption: tell the kitchen to make these things

00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:50.399
Caption: and that&#39;s a command and then the

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.920
Caption: kitchen would say this order is ready

00:37:50.399 --> 00:37:54.399
Caption: that&#39;s an event and you kind of with

00:37:51.919 --> 00:37:56.159
Caption: different colored sticky notes

00:37:54.399 --> 00:37:57.598
Caption: stick them all on a board with these are

00:37:56.159 --> 00:38:00.559
Caption: the commands and these are the events

00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:03.280
Caption: and then figure out what talks to what

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:05.599
Caption: and why and you end up with a really

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.880
Caption: good mapping of the way an organization

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:08.560
Caption: should work

00:38:06.879 --> 00:38:10.399
Caption: and

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.560
Caption: then build the software around that so

00:38:10.399 --> 00:38:13.919
Caption: again

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.920
Caption: commands and events work really well

00:38:13.919 --> 00:38:17.679
Caption: here

00:38:15.919 --> 00:38:21.118
Caption: i&#39;m going to quickly talk about kind of

00:38:17.679 --> 00:38:23.760
Caption: the tech of that um because often like

00:38:21.118 --> 00:38:26.879
Caption: people sort of tend to think about um

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:28.719
Caption: micro services as you know just rest

00:38:26.879 --> 00:38:30.239
Caption: um but i actually really like messaging

00:38:28.719 --> 00:38:32.639
Caption: for a lot of this stuff

00:38:30.239 --> 00:38:35.839
Caption: because it maps really quite well

00:38:32.639 --> 00:38:37.679
Caption: so http is a synchronous

00:38:35.839 --> 00:38:39.040
Caption: transport you know that&#39;s about

00:38:37.679 --> 00:38:40.159
Caption: requesting a document and getting

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.479
Caption: something back

00:38:40.159 --> 00:38:45.760
Caption: and what we&#39;ve learned is synchronous

00:38:42.479 --> 00:38:47.919
Caption: calls will reduce your reliability

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.280
Caption: and they reduce your ability to scale

00:38:47.919 --> 00:38:50.319
Caption: and you have to deploy stuff at exactly

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.000
Caption: the right time because it&#39;s not

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.000
Caption: something there you know it gets hard

00:38:54.079 --> 00:38:57.200
Caption: so

00:38:54.959 --> 00:38:59.280
Caption: you can still use http to model commands

00:38:57.199 --> 00:39:00.560
Caption: and events if you want but it ends up

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.839
Caption: being a bunch more work you might have a

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.760
Caption: table of events and then you know all

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:05.920
Caption: the other services have to kind of poll

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.919
Caption: that table and keep a cursor and it&#39;s

00:39:05.919 --> 00:39:12.159
Caption: extra database stuff so messaging kind

00:39:07.919 --> 00:39:12.159
Caption: of works really really well for this um

00:39:13.358 --> 00:39:16.000
Caption: you know for this for this style of

00:39:14.639 --> 00:39:18.078
Caption: thing because you can you can put a

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.040
Caption: command on a queue

00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:20.880
Caption: oh

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.640
Caption: sorry

00:39:20.879 --> 00:39:23.598
Caption: um

00:39:22.639 --> 00:39:25.199
Caption: and

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:26.720
Caption: yeah you can have pub sub and and

00:39:25.199 --> 00:39:30.399
Caption: messaging systems work really really

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:30.399
Caption: well for micro services

00:39:30.719 --> 00:39:33.598
Caption: rest is still a great api service

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:35.760
Caption: particularly on the web like the web is

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:37.359
Caption: built around http we&#39;ve got cdns we&#39;ve

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.040
Caption: got proxies you know like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a

00:39:37.358 --> 00:39:40.879
Caption: really good protocol there&#39;s lots of

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.760
Caption: semantics built into it

00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:45.919
Caption: into http and then you sort of apply a

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.320
Caption: rest style on top of that that&#39;s a whole

00:39:45.919 --> 00:39:50.799
Caption: other discussion um

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:52.000
Caption: you know hypertext is a good thing like

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:55.880
Caption: a lot of the web is built on that and

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.879
Caption: scales really really well

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.000
Caption: so i have a pattern that i&#39;ve had a lot

00:39:58.159 --> 00:40:01.838
Caption: of success with that again

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.040
Caption: as a joke one day i call it mullet micro

00:40:01.839 --> 00:40:04.560
Caption: services

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.439
Caption: um because it&#39;s got rest on the front

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.439
Caption: and messaging in the back

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.199
Caption: and people seem to like that so i&#39;m i&#39;m

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.800
Caption: sticking with it um but this is a

00:40:11.199 --> 00:40:14.719
Caption: pattern i&#39;ve had a lot of success with

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.719
Caption: um even in sort of replacing legacy

00:40:14.719 --> 00:40:19.598
Caption: systems where you can build services

00:40:16.719 --> 00:40:20.959
Caption: um behind a load balancer yeah

00:40:19.599 --> 00:40:23.680
Caption: but their back plane the way they

00:40:20.959 --> 00:40:25.118
Caption: communicate to each other is um through

00:40:23.679 --> 00:40:26.959
Caption: messages from a message broker or you

00:40:25.118 --> 00:40:28.159
Caption: know something like that

00:40:26.959 --> 00:40:31.520
Caption: and i&#39;m running out of time really

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:33.039
Caption: quickly some conclusions um

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.199
Caption: from all of this is

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.199
Caption: learn from history like you want to set

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:39.118
Caption: out to to use a new technique or a new

00:40:37.199 --> 00:40:41.199
Caption: tool or a piece of infrastructure or

00:40:39.118 --> 00:40:43.679
Caption: patent or whatever it is

00:40:41.199 --> 00:40:45.679
Caption: understand that idea and what led to it

00:40:43.679 --> 00:40:47.598
Caption: like what problem

00:40:45.679 --> 00:40:48.800
Caption: was being solved when somebody created

00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:50.320
Caption: this thing

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.839
Caption: what caused that problem that they were

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.959
Caption: trying to

00:40:51.839 --> 00:40:55.359
Caption: what caused that

00:40:52.959 --> 00:40:57.118
Caption: understand the history of in context of

00:40:55.358 --> 00:40:58.078
Caption: how we got there

00:40:57.118 --> 00:40:59.838
Caption: and doing that would just make you a

00:40:58.079 --> 00:41:01.119
Caption: better technologist like we&#39;re going to

00:40:59.839 --> 00:41:03.440
Caption: use this thing and it was designed to

00:41:01.118 --> 00:41:05.519
Caption: solve this problem we have that problem

00:41:03.439 --> 00:41:06.639
Caption: it&#39;s a good fit if it&#39;s we want to do

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.399
Caption: that because it&#39;s on hacker news and

00:41:06.639 --> 00:41:11.838
Caption: it&#39;s really cool you&#39;re going to be a

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:11.838
Caption: less effective technologist

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.959
Caption: another takeaway is microservices and so

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.959
Caption: i kind of have the same routes and the

00:41:18.959 --> 00:41:22.800
Caption: same problems they&#39;re about if you go

00:41:20.959 --> 00:41:25.199
Caption: back and read sort of the the early

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.599
Caption: stuff around sower it&#39;s about services

00:41:25.199 --> 00:41:30.639
Caption: that are loosely coupled and

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:32.240
Caption: autonomously manage a business process

00:41:30.639 --> 00:41:33.760
Caption: and micro services are kind of the same

00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:36.639
Caption: but a bit smaller but essentially the

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.639
Caption: principles are there

00:41:36.879 --> 00:41:40.000
Caption: and you know if we sort of don&#39;t like

00:41:38.639 --> 00:41:44.078
Caption: autonomously manage that business

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.079
Caption: process they get super chatty

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:49.679
Caption: in modeling look at the people business

00:41:47.358 --> 00:41:51.279
Caption: processes how would people do that model

00:41:49.679 --> 00:41:52.719
Caption: your software after that and then the

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.479
Caption: main one is never forget that actually

00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:56.639
Caption: delivering value is the goal

00:41:54.479 --> 00:41:59.118
Caption: um that&#39;s what we&#39;re here for that&#39;s the

00:41:56.639 --> 00:42:01.519
Caption: smart bit like your job isn&#39;t well i you

00:41:59.118 --> 00:42:03.039
Caption: know bring containers to an organization

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.880
Caption: your job is about

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.400
Caption: you know delivering value whether that&#39;s

00:42:04.879 --> 00:42:07.838
Caption: selling something customers or solving

00:42:06.399 --> 00:42:09.439
Caption: the internal problem whatever it is

00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:13.119
Caption: that&#39;s the goal

00:42:09.439 --> 00:42:13.118
Caption: and we get way too caught up in that

00:42:14.399 --> 00:42:18.479
Caption: so yeah with that i&#39;m going to do a

00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:20.879
Caption: quick plug

00:42:18.479 --> 00:42:22.000
Caption: which is i&#39;m teaching this stuff um and

00:42:20.879 --> 00:42:23.199
Caption: if anyone wants to come and talk to me

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.319
Caption: about that i would love to have that

00:42:23.199 --> 00:42:27.679
Caption: chat

00:42:24.319 --> 00:42:29.760
Caption: essentially i&#39;ve seen this enough times

00:42:27.679 --> 00:42:31.598
Caption: that i&#39;m like what can i do about this

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.439
Caption: so i actually want to teach it you know

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:35.200
Caption: teach this stuff and get hands on but i

00:42:33.439 --> 00:42:38.159
Caption: don&#39;t want to make it too much of a plug

00:42:35.199 --> 00:42:40.318
Caption: with that we&#39;re getting low on time

00:42:38.159 --> 00:42:42.399
Caption: any questions and i&#39;m happy to i&#39;m happy

00:42:40.319 --> 00:42:44.560
Caption: for you to accost me all day and and

00:42:42.399 --> 00:42:46.959
Caption: chat about this stuff but any questions

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.959
Caption: in the room

00:42:51.679 --> 00:42:56.000
Caption: thanks for that that was great mate um i

00:42:53.919 --> 00:42:57.679
Caption: work in a medium-sized organization that

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.639
Caption: was that&#39;s now integrating with a very

00:42:57.679 --> 00:43:00.399
Caption: large

00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:02.239
Caption: organization um

00:43:00.399 --> 00:43:04.399
Caption: what are the kind of

00:43:02.239 --> 00:43:06.639
Caption: i guess cultural preconditions for

00:43:04.399 --> 00:43:08.078
Caption: microservices and especially in an

00:43:06.639 --> 00:43:10.239
Caption: organization that&#39;s already on the

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:11.359
Caption: journey but

00:43:10.239 --> 00:43:13.118
Caption: yeah

00:43:11.358 --> 00:43:14.318
Caption: yeah that&#39;s a that&#39;s a tricky one and i

00:43:13.118 --> 00:43:15.838
Caption: like honestly i&#39;ve not seen a

00:43:14.319 --> 00:43:18.479
Caption: one-size-fits-all

00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:19.599
Caption: to that um the biggest problem seems to

00:43:18.479 --> 00:43:21.439
Caption: be in those

00:43:19.599 --> 00:43:22.720
Caption: those journeys and those organizations

00:43:21.439 --> 00:43:24.879
Caption: is that

00:43:22.719 --> 00:43:26.800
Caption: it&#39;s very hard to get anything started

00:43:24.879 --> 00:43:28.879
Caption: because they&#39;re so risk adverse that no

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.959
Caption: one ever wants to fail so it&#39;s you know

00:43:28.879 --> 00:43:32.879
Caption: and i&#39;ve seen this in a big organization

00:43:30.959 --> 00:43:34.639
Caption: where it&#39;s like we want to do this thing

00:43:32.879 --> 00:43:36.799
Caption: very simple and they&#39;re like you can&#39;t

00:43:34.639 --> 00:43:37.598
Caption: do that because we are still figuring

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.760
Caption: out

00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:41.760
Caption: what our container strategy is or what

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:43.199
Caption: our messaging strategy is or and then

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.679
Caption: you&#39;ve got you know a team of enterprise

00:43:43.199 --> 00:43:47.040
Caption: architects that will take 12 months to

00:43:45.679 --> 00:43:49.679
Caption: make a ruling on something before you

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:52.239
Caption: can touch it and it&#39;s all very like oh

00:43:49.679 --> 00:43:53.760
Caption: and that&#39;s super hard

00:43:52.239 --> 00:43:55.520
Caption: if you&#39;re in that organization and you

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.639
Caption: can ship

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.159
Caption: then

00:43:56.639 --> 00:44:00.719
Caption: um

00:43:58.159 --> 00:44:02.639
Caption: yeah just do small things quickly um and

00:44:00.719 --> 00:44:04.319
Caption: again you know in in sort of technical

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:06.078
Caption: stuff http is great like you don&#39;t want

00:44:04.319 --> 00:44:08.079
Caption: to expose like you&#39;ve got you know

00:44:06.079 --> 00:44:09.280
Caption: active mq or like a message broker back

00:44:08.079 --> 00:44:10.880
Caption: there you probably don&#39;t want to expose

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.199
Caption: that because you want to change your

00:44:10.879 --> 00:44:15.199
Caption: semantics so if you go well this is our

00:44:13.199 --> 00:44:17.520
Caption: boundary is an api that people can

00:44:15.199 --> 00:44:18.560
Caption: request and treat it like a third party

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.000
Caption: um

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.680
Caption: yeah we&#39;d love to hear more about it

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.040
Caption: later it&#39;s a yeah

00:44:21.679 --> 00:44:24.800

00:50:36.879 --> 00:50:41.598
Caption: we got a little problem

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.119
Caption: as you know our motto is you need a

00:50:41.599 --> 00:50:44.559
Caption: professional bodyguard delivered to your

00:50:43.118 --> 00:50:46.799
Caption: door in less than half an hour you&#39;ve

00:50:44.559 --> 00:50:49.119
Caption: got it buddy but without an app ain&#39;t no

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:51.760
Caption: bodyguard getting delivered nowhere so

00:50:49.118 --> 00:50:55.199
Caption: where are we with that uh the app is

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:56.239
Caption: almost ready uh we just need

00:50:55.199 --> 00:50:58.479
Caption: three

00:50:56.239 --> 00:51:00.239
Caption: more days we need it asap

00:50:58.479 --> 00:51:02.239
Caption: okay team what&#39;s the status on the app

00:51:00.239 --> 00:51:04.559
Caption: we&#39;re good to go except our login

00:51:02.239 --> 00:51:06.479
Caption: experience is a disaster

00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:08.319
Caption: we need something to keep our users data

00:51:06.479 --> 00:51:11.040
Caption: private

00:51:08.319 --> 00:51:12.880
Caption: and to keep the hackers out

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:15.119
Caption: and it needs to work flawlessly because

00:51:12.879 --> 00:51:17.358
Caption: because i don&#39;t want to lose one single

00:51:15.118 --> 00:51:19.598
Caption: customer i hear you so let&#39;s use off

00:51:17.358 --> 00:51:21.919
Caption: zero off what now off zero it&#39;s an

00:51:19.599 --> 00:51:23.680
Caption: identity platform fast easy logins just

00:51:21.919 --> 00:51:25.118
Caption: what the boss wants can we make our own

00:51:23.679 --> 00:51:26.239

Caption: right hey guys i&#39;m boris so um i&#39;m an

01:07:14.799 --> 01:07:20.880
Caption: engineer at bgw i&#39;ve been working in the

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:22.880
Caption: industry for roughly four years

01:07:20.879 --> 01:07:24.558
Caption: and for the majority of their experience

01:07:22.879 --> 01:07:26.399
Caption: um

01:07:24.559 --> 01:07:28.319
Caption: i&#39;ve known indexes as they make a

01:07:26.399 --> 01:07:29.919
Caption: database go fast and that was the extent

01:07:28.319 --> 01:07:31.440
Caption: of my knowledge

01:07:29.919 --> 01:07:33.118
Caption: so we had some issues with an

01:07:31.439 --> 01:07:35.520
Caption: application that i was working on and it

01:07:33.118 --> 01:07:38.159
Caption: was oh okay we&#39;re gonna use an index

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:39.760
Caption: so i got compelled hey let&#39;s figure out

01:07:38.159 --> 01:07:42.159
Caption: what this is

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:44.159
Caption: so today what are we learning when we

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:46.159
Caption: learn about indexes how do they work

01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:47.439
Caption: indexing techniques and how to debug

01:07:46.159 --> 01:07:49.199
Caption: indexes

01:07:47.439 --> 01:07:50.959
Caption: so this will be going off postgres&#39;s

01:07:49.199 --> 01:07:53.598
Caption: implementation of indexes but this is

01:07:50.959 --> 01:07:55.439
Caption: relatively a high level talk so the

01:07:53.599 --> 01:07:57.920
Caption: concepts should translate over to other

01:07:55.439 --> 01:07:59.919
Caption: databases as well

01:07:57.919 --> 01:08:01.439
Caption: um shout out to the sponsors today for

01:07:59.919 --> 01:08:03.919
Caption: making today possible and also to the

01:08:01.439 --> 01:08:06.558
Caption: volunteers and the av team or everything

01:08:03.919 --> 01:08:07.520
Caption: for keeping everything organized

01:08:06.559 --> 01:08:08.719
Caption: right

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:11.359
Caption: today

01:08:08.719 --> 01:08:13.838
Caption: we are doing some work we i

01:08:11.358 --> 01:08:15.439
Caption: are a website recipe aggregator we get

01:08:13.839 --> 01:08:17.199
Caption: something like reddit hack news we get

01:08:15.439 --> 01:08:19.120
Caption: recipes from other places and we display

01:08:17.199 --> 01:08:21.040
Caption: them for everyone to see

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.159
Caption: cool so we&#39;re working with product we&#39;re

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.159
Caption: working on a future we&#39;re going to be

01:08:22.159 --> 01:08:26.080
Caption: generating some reports with some

01:08:24.159 --> 01:08:27.839
Caption: queries essentially so we&#39;re going to be

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.679
Caption: working with one table today it looks

01:08:27.838 --> 01:08:31.600
Caption: something like this

01:08:29.679 --> 01:08:33.920
Caption: it&#39;s quite straightforward um if you&#39;re

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.838
Caption: not sure generated always as identity

01:08:33.919 --> 01:08:37.678
Caption: means it just is an incrementing number

01:08:35.838 --> 01:08:40.238
Caption: that the database does automatically for

01:08:37.679 --> 01:08:43.359
Caption: you so it&#39;s always going to be unique

01:08:40.238 --> 01:08:44.798
Caption: and some example data that we have here

01:08:43.358 --> 01:08:46.798
Caption: minutes is in

01:08:44.798 --> 01:08:48.479
Caption: cooking times in minutes as well

01:08:46.798 --> 01:08:50.639
Caption: and yes we&#39;ve got roughly around a

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:52.640
Caption: million rows today so it&#39;s not a huge

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.319
Caption: table but it&#39;s decent enough to

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:56.640
Caption: illustrate

01:08:54.318 --> 01:08:59.119
Caption: so we&#39;re working with product the first

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:00.640
Caption: feature we want it uses our query

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.239
Caption: something like this

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:07.600
Caption: which is somewhat straightforward

01:09:04.238 --> 01:09:08.798
Caption: let&#39;s do some testing so dev is okay

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.560
Caption: cool

01:09:08.798 --> 01:09:12.959
Caption: let&#39;s go to prod

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.919
Caption: now let&#39;s deploy

01:09:12.959 --> 01:09:16.399
Caption: huh

01:09:13.919 --> 01:09:18.479
Caption: it didn&#39;t work right i wonder why

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:20.080
Caption: let&#39;s revert the change let&#39;s go back

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:21.358
Caption: and let&#39;s talk about what what do we

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.640
Caption: just do

01:09:21.358 --> 01:09:23.838
Caption: i&#39;m going to give you a cooking book and

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.640
Caption: i want you to keep this for the rest of

01:09:23.838 --> 01:09:28.798
Caption: the talk so i ask you hey can i can you

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.000
Caption: find me all recipes of garlic go through

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:33.040
Caption: the book we go okay g sorry not g you go

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.120
Caption: through the book you have to go through

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.080
Caption: the whole book page by page by page by

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.358
Caption: page

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.759
Caption: all the way to the end because you don&#39;t

01:09:37.358 --> 01:09:40.959
Caption: know maybe that last page has a recipe

01:09:39.758 --> 01:09:43.119
Caption: with garlic but you don&#39;t know so you

01:09:40.959 --> 01:09:46.640
Caption: have to go through the entire book so

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.640
Caption: that&#39;s called a sequential scan

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.439
Caption: so we do a bit of googling and obviously

01:09:49.278 --> 01:09:52.959
Caption: i&#39;m here to talk to you about indexes so

01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:54.000
Caption: let&#39;s use an index let&#39;s get this over

01:09:52.959 --> 01:09:56.399
Caption: and done with

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.879
Caption: i get the syntax that overflow tells me

01:09:56.399 --> 01:10:00.000
Caption: this is correct i will always trust them

01:09:58.879 --> 01:10:01.120
Caption: obviously

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Caption: cool

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:06.000
Caption: davis again fine let&#39;s go to prod it&#39;s

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.879
Caption: done easy okay

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.040
Caption: well

01:10:06.879 --> 01:10:11.198
Caption: what do we just do

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:13.280
Caption: so again cookbook

01:10:11.199 --> 01:10:15.360
Caption: i give you the cookbook and conveniently

01:10:13.279 --> 01:10:17.520
Caption: it has a thing well called an index

01:10:15.359 --> 01:10:20.879
Caption: right which translates to databases so

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.719
Caption: go to the index go down you go to g find

01:10:20.879 --> 01:10:24.718
Caption: garlic and you find all the recipes that

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:26.719
Caption: have garlic and then you have the page

01:10:24.719 --> 01:10:28.400
Caption: numbers and then you can go to the book

01:10:26.719 --> 01:10:29.760
Caption: and you find all the recipes that have

01:10:28.399 --> 01:10:30.879
Caption: garlic much quicker than going through

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:32.799
Caption: the whole book

01:10:30.879 --> 01:10:34.479
Caption: so something like so

01:10:32.799 --> 01:10:37.279
Caption: we have two recipes with garlic chicken

01:10:34.479 --> 01:10:40.238
Caption: roast and garlic bread on pages 800 and

01:10:37.279 --> 01:10:40.238
Caption: pages 6.

01:10:40.479 --> 01:10:45.679
Caption: so before i explain databases let&#39;s talk

01:10:43.359 --> 01:10:48.158
Caption: a little bit about ferry what what is an

01:10:45.679 --> 01:10:50.640
Caption: index well in this case so there&#39;s a few

01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:53.120
Caption: different types of indexes here

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.800
Caption: default is b3 um and i think it&#39;s every

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.760
Caption: database is but it&#39;s the fault of b3

01:10:54.799 --> 01:10:56.718
Caption: there&#39;s a whole bunch of others but

01:10:55.759 --> 01:11:00.238
Caption: they&#39;re very complicated i&#39;m not going

01:10:56.719 --> 01:11:01.840
Caption: to cover them so b3

01:11:00.238 --> 01:11:05.919
Caption: what does it look like

01:11:01.839 --> 01:11:08.639
Caption: okay so at the top we have the root note

01:11:05.919 --> 01:11:10.238
Caption: at the bottom we have the leaf nodes

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.840
Caption: and you can notice it&#39;s kind of ordered

01:11:10.238 --> 01:11:14.959
Caption: with the smallest numbers at the left

01:11:11.839 --> 01:11:14.959
Caption: biggest numbers at the right

01:11:15.359 --> 01:11:19.359
Caption: and b tree is balance free not a binary

01:11:17.759 --> 01:11:21.198
Caption: tree

01:11:19.359 --> 01:11:22.000
Caption: so searching

01:11:21.199 --> 01:11:23.920
Caption: uh

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.759
Caption: searching insertion and deletion is all

01:11:23.919 --> 01:11:26.959
Caption: log in as long as it remains balanced

01:11:25.759 --> 01:11:28.959
Caption: database will do that for you so you

01:11:26.959 --> 01:11:30.959
Caption: don&#39;t need to worry about that balance

01:11:28.959 --> 01:11:32.959
Caption: meaning from the root node the top node

01:11:30.959 --> 01:11:34.959
Caption: to the bottom node for all root uh

01:11:32.959 --> 01:11:37.679
Caption: bottom nodes is the same amount of nodes

01:11:34.959 --> 01:11:40.479
Caption: to climb up that means it&#39;s balance

01:11:37.679 --> 01:11:42.479
Caption: so say searching i want to find value

01:11:40.479 --> 01:11:44.640
Caption: 999 which is at the bottom so i start at

01:11:42.479 --> 01:11:47.040
Caption: the root node

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:50.479
Caption: 999 is greater than 800

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:54.399
Caption: so we go to 900. 999 is greater than 900

01:11:50.479 --> 01:11:55.839
Caption: so we go to 999. ta-da found our value

01:11:54.399 --> 01:11:58.000
Caption: okay

01:11:55.839 --> 01:11:59.759
Caption: so how&#39;s it working well how does this

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.679
Caption: actually work right so remember we had

01:11:59.759 --> 01:12:03.678
Caption: the cookbook bring the index so in

01:12:01.679 --> 01:12:05.040
Caption: database world we went and found our

01:12:03.679 --> 01:12:06.800
Caption: value

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.120
Caption: of one one one

01:12:06.799 --> 01:12:12.079
Caption: and what it had there essentially is

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:14.000
Caption: well you can look at it as has a row id

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:16.479
Caption: and that row id is actually the database

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.159
Caption: id and it goes to this row id i&#39;m sorry

01:12:16.479 --> 01:12:19.600
Caption: it gets the one one one it gives us

01:12:18.159 --> 01:12:20.719
Caption: variety then actually goes back to the

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:23.199
Caption: table and gets the rest of the

01:12:20.719 --> 01:12:24.800
Caption: information which is a lot faster than

01:12:23.199 --> 01:12:26.000
Caption: you know sequentially scanning and it&#39;s

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:27.599
Caption: kind of like the cookbook you don&#39;t have

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.600
Caption: the whole recipe in the index you just

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:31.679
Caption: have go to this page number and go find

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.679
Caption: it

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.159
Caption: so

01:12:32.879 --> 01:12:37.600
Caption: enough theory oh it&#39;s kind of boring

01:12:34.159 --> 01:12:38.959
Caption: let&#39;s make this quite practical

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.919
Caption: tell me what the index

01:12:38.959 --> 01:12:42.080
Caption: okay

01:12:39.919 --> 01:12:44.399
Caption: let&#39;s do something really generic

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.280
Caption: wear or join index it your primary keys

01:12:44.399 --> 01:12:46.879
Caption: you need constraints will be

01:12:45.279 --> 01:12:48.879
Caption: automatically indexed

01:12:46.879 --> 01:12:50.959
Caption: but like everything else in software

01:12:48.879 --> 01:12:52.879
Caption: well it&#39;s not that straightforward

01:12:50.959 --> 01:12:54.399
Caption: obviously so the

01:12:52.879 --> 01:12:56.479
Caption: point i&#39;m going to hammer in today is

01:12:54.399 --> 01:12:58.158
Caption: know your queries know your queries are

01:12:56.479 --> 01:12:59.839
Caption: expensive or long-running the most

01:12:58.159 --> 01:13:02.159
Caption: executed queries and your most important

01:12:59.839 --> 01:13:04.319
Caption: queries that will give you the starting

01:13:02.159 --> 01:13:06.800
Caption: ground when uh where to create your

01:13:04.319 --> 01:13:06.799
Caption: indexes

01:13:07.199 --> 01:13:11.120
Caption: so that comes kind of to the next point

01:13:09.199 --> 01:13:12.479
Caption: well why not just index all the indexes

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.919
Caption: right want to just do absolutely

01:13:12.479 --> 01:13:16.080
Caption: everything

01:13:13.919 --> 01:13:18.080
Caption: well there&#39;s trade-offs with indexes

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.800
Caption: let&#39;s think the cookbook we did a very

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:23.919
Caption: simple one index on ingredient but let&#39;s

01:13:20.799 --> 01:13:26.238
Caption: say i then do cuisine i do category i do

01:13:23.919 --> 01:13:28.080
Caption: the maybe the chef

01:13:26.238 --> 01:13:29.519
Caption: how long it takes

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:32.399
Caption: and your index is just going to keep

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:34.000
Caption: going in size and keep going in size and

01:13:32.399 --> 01:13:36.158
Caption: now your index is bigger than the book

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.080
Caption: so it came kind of useless

01:13:36.159 --> 01:13:41.600
Caption: and you have to think okay there&#39;s also

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:44.080
Caption: insertions so let&#39;s imagine a book again

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.919
Caption: if i tell you hey um here&#39;s a new recipe

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:47.439
Caption: with garlic and you go okay sure you put

01:13:45.919 --> 01:13:48.560
Caption: that recipe in your book you update your

01:13:47.439 --> 01:13:50.718
Caption: book with this recipe and then you have

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.800
Caption: to go to the index and update the index

01:13:50.719 --> 01:13:54.000
Caption: as well so this is if you have too many

01:13:52.799 --> 01:13:56.639
Caption: indexes it&#39;s just going to get longer

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.879
Caption: and longer and longer in short

01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:01.439
Caption: indexes give you increased read speed

01:13:58.879 --> 01:14:03.600
Caption: decreased write speed

01:14:01.439 --> 01:14:03.600
Caption: so

01:14:04.799 --> 01:14:08.639
Caption: now you might think okay well why not

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.919
Caption: okay we know that we shouldn&#39;t index

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.360
Caption: everything but how do i know i don&#39;t

01:14:09.919 --> 01:14:13.600
Caption: want to risk like

01:14:11.359 --> 01:14:14.879
Caption: having a poor performance you know your

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.719
Caption: company&#39;s going to start losing money

01:14:14.879 --> 01:14:18.080
Caption: it&#39;s not really nice to deploy something

01:14:16.719 --> 01:14:19.840
Caption: sit there waiting anxiously is it going

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.839
Caption: to be okay or not

01:14:19.839 --> 01:14:25.119
Caption: so again know your queries

01:14:21.839 --> 01:14:26.718
Caption: do your queries need to be fast

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.879
Caption: um and what are they for so

01:14:26.719 --> 01:14:30.719
Caption: announcements they&#39;re for reports are

01:14:28.879 --> 01:14:32.799
Caption: reports time critical do they need to

01:14:30.719 --> 01:14:34.239
Caption: actually execute instantly

01:14:32.799 --> 01:14:37.198
Caption: generally i&#39;d say no i mean for the

01:14:34.238 --> 01:14:38.959
Caption: purposes of talk we want them but um in

01:14:37.199 --> 01:14:40.800
Caption: that case no do you ever read replica

01:14:38.959 --> 01:14:43.120
Caption: maybe like a database that can bear the

01:14:40.799 --> 01:14:45.198
Caption: extra load of reading well then

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.959
Caption: maybe you don&#39;t need them

01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:48.960
Caption: now when it comes to say application do

01:14:46.959 --> 01:14:50.718
Caption: you have observer observability and

01:14:48.959 --> 01:14:52.479
Caption: alerting on your application that can

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:54.480
Caption: indicate poor performance

01:14:52.479 --> 01:14:56.399
Caption: do you have a way to deploy this feature

01:14:54.479 --> 01:14:58.959
Caption: to a small small subset of customers

01:14:56.399 --> 01:15:00.399
Caption: first and see what&#39;s going on before

01:14:58.959 --> 01:15:01.520
Caption: making a call to apply to everyone if

01:15:00.399 --> 01:15:03.678
Caption: you have something like that then you

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:05.199
Caption: can hold off on pre-indexing but again

01:15:03.679 --> 01:15:08.320
Caption: it comes down to knowing your queries

01:15:05.199 --> 01:15:08.320
Caption: how much data is there

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:15.360
Caption: alrighty so more work time which means

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.359
Caption: more indexes to create

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.239
Caption: but

01:15:18.159 --> 01:15:21.600
Caption: there&#39;s a few caveats here so first

01:15:20.238 --> 01:15:24.158
Caption: thing you might have noticed

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.080
Caption: dave was okay but prod wasn&#39;t there&#39;s

01:15:24.159 --> 01:15:27.280
Caption: quite a few factors that come to effect

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.959
Caption: this sort of thing

01:15:27.279 --> 01:15:30.238
Caption: first of all is a hardware that your

01:15:28.959 --> 01:15:32.399
Caption: database is running on is going to

01:15:30.238 --> 01:15:34.479
Caption: influence your results

01:15:32.399 --> 01:15:36.000
Caption: um the volume of data so generally

01:15:34.479 --> 01:15:38.159
Caption: you&#39;re going to have a smaller

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.159
Caption: set of data locally or in div compared

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:42.400
Caption: to prod and the distribution

01:15:40.159 --> 01:15:43.920
Caption: distribution of data is also extremely

01:15:42.399 --> 01:15:45.120
Caption: important as well

01:15:43.919 --> 01:15:46.718
Caption: um

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.679
Caption: so that is something to keep in mind

01:15:46.719 --> 01:15:48.960
Caption: when you&#39;re

01:15:47.679 --> 01:15:50.239
Caption: when you have indexes in different

01:15:48.959 --> 01:15:51.600
Caption: environments and stuff like that and

01:15:50.238 --> 01:15:52.479
Caption: even some of these results today you&#39;ll

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.640
Caption: see

01:15:52.479 --> 01:15:57.919
Caption: um a bit skewed because i&#39;ve just put

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.919
Caption: this data on my machine

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.359
Caption: okay

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:02.959
Caption: so first thing i want to cover is

01:16:01.359 --> 01:16:04.799
Caption: creating index is the correct way so i

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:06.799
Caption: showed you this but

01:16:04.799 --> 01:16:08.959
Caption: you&#39;re never going to do this because

01:16:06.799 --> 01:16:11.198
Caption: this locks the database against writes

01:16:08.959 --> 01:16:13.120
Caption: to that table which in production at

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:15.440
Caption: least my experience that&#39;s usually well

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.360
Caption: not very good so we add it concurrently

01:16:15.439 --> 01:16:18.959
Caption: and what this does is

01:16:17.359 --> 01:16:21.520
Caption: does a scan with a table

01:16:18.959 --> 01:16:23.520
Caption: and doesn&#39;t lock that doesn&#39;t lock it

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:26.399
Caption: gets everything and it kind of does it

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:28.560
Caption: again afterwards to get capture all the

01:16:26.399 --> 01:16:29.839
Caption: missing transactions from before

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:31.760
Caption: it&#39;s very high level it gets a bit more

01:16:29.839 --> 01:16:33.359
Caption: complicated than that but that&#39;s the

01:16:31.759 --> 01:16:34.639
Caption: gist of it and there are queries that

01:16:33.359 --> 01:16:37.119
Caption: you can actually run to see is your

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.959
Caption: index still being created or not

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:41.439
Caption: um it&#39;s long and it&#39;s ugly google it if

01:16:38.959 --> 01:16:42.479
Caption: you want it but that&#39;s the gist of it

01:16:41.439 --> 01:16:44.000
Caption: okay

01:16:42.479 --> 01:16:46.399
Caption: before we do some work we also have to

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.040
Caption: talk about debugging so the cool thing

01:16:46.399 --> 01:16:51.040
Caption: databases is you can go to and say hey

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.399
Caption: what do you think you&#39;re going to do and

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.719
Caption: then you can also tell hey what are you

01:16:52.399 --> 01:16:56.158
Caption: going to do um what are what did you

01:16:54.719 --> 01:16:58.880
Caption: actually do and then you can compare

01:16:56.159 --> 01:17:02.320
Caption: them and make judgment calls on that

01:16:58.879 --> 01:17:03.520
Caption: so in postgres we prefix our query with

01:17:02.319 --> 01:17:05.520
Caption: explain

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:07.199
Caption: and that&#39;s essentially time postgres hey

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:10.799
Caption: what do you think you&#39;re going to do

01:17:07.199 --> 01:17:12.080
Caption: here now i might be thinking okay

01:17:10.799 --> 01:17:13.359
Caption: how does it know what it thinks it&#39;s

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.280
Caption: going to do

01:17:13.359 --> 01:17:16.959
Caption: this is a very complicated topic and

01:17:15.279 --> 01:17:18.799
Caption: finally put this is a talk on its own

01:17:16.959 --> 01:17:20.238
Caption: it&#39;s i went on a bit of a rabbit hole in

01:17:18.799 --> 01:17:22.238
Caption: this and it&#39;s absolutely incredible how

01:17:20.238 --> 01:17:23.678
Caption: it does it uses all sorts of statistics

01:17:22.238 --> 01:17:25.279
Caption: and stored in the table to make these

01:17:23.679 --> 01:17:27.520
Caption: calls

01:17:25.279 --> 01:17:29.678
Caption: so let&#39;s look at what this kind of looks

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:30.719
Caption: like

01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:34.320
Caption: so

01:17:30.719 --> 01:17:35.840
Caption: at the top we have you can see here cost

01:17:34.319 --> 01:17:37.919
Caption: that first number

01:17:35.839 --> 01:17:39.040
Caption: is the cost to find the first node our

01:17:37.919 --> 01:17:40.879
Caption: first row

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.159
Caption: then the next number which is 13 000

01:17:40.879 --> 01:17:44.399
Caption: something something something that&#39;s the

01:17:42.159 --> 01:17:45.439
Caption: cost to find all rows what it estimates

01:17:44.399 --> 01:17:47.279
Caption: to be

01:17:45.439 --> 01:17:49.279
Caption: the funny part about this and this is a

01:17:47.279 --> 01:17:50.319
Caption: quote from the post documentation might

01:17:49.279 --> 01:17:51.678
Caption: be thinking okay what does that number

01:17:50.319 --> 01:17:54.238
Caption: represent

01:17:51.679 --> 01:17:55.760
Caption: it&#39;s an arbitrary unit so it differs on

01:17:54.238 --> 01:17:57.519
Caption: your laptop and a bunch of things there

01:17:55.759 --> 01:17:59.439
Caption: is a long formula uses like the hardware

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:01.120
Caption: your laptop your computer all sorts of

01:17:59.439 --> 01:18:02.319
Caption: stuff to try and figure it out

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.080
Caption: so it&#39;s not particularly useful you

01:18:02.319 --> 01:18:06.238
Caption: could say

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.399
Caption: then we have how many rows that things

01:18:06.238 --> 01:18:10.399
Caption: match this condition and the width of

01:18:08.399 --> 01:18:11.359
Caption: each row which is in bytes if i remember

01:18:10.399 --> 01:18:14.080
Caption: correctly

01:18:11.359 --> 01:18:16.399
Caption: and then we could see it did a parallel

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:17.919
Caption: sequential scan

01:18:16.399 --> 01:18:19.279
Caption: which is what we talked about before

01:18:17.919 --> 01:18:21.600
Caption: which isn&#39;t good and it&#39;s going to do

01:18:19.279 --> 01:18:23.198
Caption: that twice because 45 times 2 is roughly

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.959
Caption: that

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:26.880
Caption: and then a filter

01:18:24.959 --> 01:18:29.359
Caption: then with the index scan it&#39;s kind of

01:18:26.879 --> 01:18:31.279
Caption: similar nothing too different than the

01:18:29.359 --> 01:18:32.799
Caption: important part here we can see it says

01:18:31.279 --> 01:18:34.238
Caption: index scan

01:18:32.799 --> 01:18:36.079
Caption: so

01:18:34.238 --> 01:18:38.718
Caption: well let&#39;s do something a bit more

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.719
Caption: interesting here

01:18:39.279 --> 01:18:42.639
Caption: let&#39;s see

01:18:40.479 --> 01:18:44.799
Caption: what it actually does

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.399
Caption: okay so now we&#39;re prefix to explain

01:18:44.799 --> 01:18:48.879
Caption: analyze analyze will tell hey can you

01:18:46.399 --> 01:18:51.279
Caption: run the query too please so we can

01:18:48.879 --> 01:18:54.319
Caption: compare

01:18:51.279 --> 01:18:56.799
Caption: and what you can see here is after say

01:18:54.319 --> 01:18:58.718
Caption: on the top line after the gather we have

01:18:56.799 --> 01:19:00.479
Caption: another one which says actual time

01:18:58.719 --> 01:19:02.400
Caption: that&#39;s in milliseconds

01:19:00.479 --> 01:19:04.319
Caption: so that&#39;s the time it takes to find the

01:19:02.399 --> 01:19:06.238
Caption: first row that matches the condition and

01:19:04.319 --> 01:19:07.198
Caption: the time to find all rows of matching

01:19:06.238 --> 01:19:08.718
Caption: condition

01:19:07.199 --> 01:19:10.640
Caption: and then we&#39;ll parallel sequential scan

01:19:08.719 --> 01:19:13.440
Caption: how long it took

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:15.280
Caption: and then we can see here is remote rows

01:19:13.439 --> 01:19:16.879
Caption: removed by filter that&#39;s an interesting

01:19:15.279 --> 01:19:18.479
Caption: part here

01:19:16.879 --> 01:19:19.919
Caption: two lines above says loops three so

01:19:18.479 --> 01:19:21.759
Caption: that&#39;s times three

01:19:19.919 --> 01:19:23.919
Caption: that filtered out the vast majority of

01:19:21.759 --> 01:19:25.678
Caption: the table so we generally say that&#39;s an

01:19:23.919 --> 01:19:27.678
Caption: absolute ideal candidate for an index

01:19:25.679 --> 01:19:30.880
Caption: when we see something like this

01:19:27.679 --> 01:19:32.080
Caption: and this took 33 milliseconds

01:19:30.879 --> 01:19:36.040
Caption: now

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:36.040
Caption: let&#39;s see how fast it indexes

01:19:36.799 --> 01:19:39.040
Caption: whoops

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.479
Caption: it was 11.8 milliseconds so that was a

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:46.080
Caption: third of the time of the sequential scan

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:48.479
Caption: and we can see it says index scans

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:50.879
Caption: before we have all the stuff

01:19:48.479 --> 01:19:52.399
Caption: as well index condition but i just want

01:19:50.879 --> 01:19:53.678
Caption: to highlight

01:19:52.399 --> 01:19:55.600
Caption: the time that it took and how much

01:19:53.679 --> 01:19:57.360
Caption: faster i was

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.199
Caption: okay so

01:19:57.359 --> 01:20:00.959
Caption: now we&#39;ve done a little bit of very very

01:19:59.199 --> 01:20:02.960
Caption: high level of the query planner let&#39;s do

01:20:00.959 --> 01:20:05.520
Caption: some more work let&#39;s see if we can learn

01:20:02.959 --> 01:20:07.359
Caption: more about this so now product design

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:10.239
Caption: says hey we don&#39;t just want author id we

01:20:07.359 --> 01:20:11.839
Caption: also want source id which is where we&#39;re

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:13.439
Caption: getting that because we&#39;re aggregated

01:20:11.839 --> 01:20:15.198
Caption: we&#39;re getting these these recipes from

01:20:13.439 --> 01:20:18.000
Caption: different sources and stuff like that so

01:20:15.199 --> 01:20:19.280
Caption: our query is going to be something like

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.319
Caption: so

01:20:19.279 --> 01:20:22.319
Caption: okay cool

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.080
Caption: you can see here we did this with no

01:20:24.399 --> 01:20:28.718
Caption: index and

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:30.080
Caption: we can see 27 milliseconds and obviously

01:20:28.719 --> 01:20:31.440
Caption: it&#39;s going to filter a lot more rows

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.800
Caption: this time there&#39;s only 12 rows in

01:20:31.439 --> 01:20:33.600
Caption: matching condition which is right at the

01:20:32.799 --> 01:20:35.520
Caption: top

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:38.399
Caption: to the right

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.399
Caption: cool alrighty

01:20:38.479 --> 01:20:44.238
Caption: so we create an index and

01:20:40.719 --> 01:20:46.080
Caption: you can see here it&#39;s multi-column index

01:20:44.238 --> 01:20:46.959
Caption: the order that you specify the columns

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.280
Caption: here

01:20:46.959 --> 01:20:50.640
Caption: is extremely important and i&#39;m going to

01:20:49.279 --> 01:20:53.678
Caption: explain a little bit more but let&#39;s

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:56.399
Caption: first see how fast this is

01:20:53.679 --> 01:20:58.159
Caption: so from 27 milliseconds to 0.2

01:20:56.399 --> 01:21:00.238
Caption: milliseconds

01:20:58.159 --> 01:21:03.520
Caption: that is lightning fast that is a pretty

01:21:00.238 --> 01:21:05.759
Caption: huge change so that&#39;s quite nice right

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:07.040
Caption: let&#39;s talk about how i said the order so

01:21:05.759 --> 01:21:09.839
Caption: we said

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:12.239
Caption: multi-column index first second i said

01:21:09.839 --> 01:21:13.040
Caption: indexes are ordered so what does that

01:21:12.238 --> 01:21:14.639
Caption: mean

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:17.359
Caption: well if i

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:20.320
Caption: create an index on author id and source

01:21:17.359 --> 01:21:21.759
Caption: id what it kind of looks like is if i go

01:21:20.319 --> 01:21:24.158
Caption: to one one one

01:21:21.759 --> 01:21:27.279
Caption: let&#39;s use the cookbook example i go to

01:21:24.159 --> 01:21:29.360
Caption: this the id of one one one one i find it

01:21:27.279 --> 01:21:32.238
Caption: then inside of it it&#39;s all going to be

01:21:29.359 --> 01:21:34.238
Caption: ordered by the source id

01:21:32.238 --> 01:21:35.759
Caption: okay cool what does this mean

01:21:34.238 --> 01:21:38.238
Caption: practically okay so we create this

01:21:35.759 --> 01:21:40.319
Caption: multi-column index

01:21:38.238 --> 01:21:42.399
Caption: and if i want to query on authority

01:21:40.319 --> 01:21:44.319
Caption: source id it works fine because i can go

01:21:42.399 --> 01:21:46.640
Caption: to one one one and other than that i

01:21:44.319 --> 01:21:48.718
Caption: have 40 right

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.719
Caption: if i want to do just on author id that&#39;s

01:21:48.719 --> 01:21:53.520
Caption: going to work too because well it&#39;s

01:21:50.719 --> 01:21:57.520
Caption: ordered first by author id right

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:59.600
Caption: but if i ask if i write a query and it&#39;s

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:01.120
Caption: like hey can you get it by just source

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:03.760
Caption: id well

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:05.520
Caption: no that&#39;s not going to work because

01:22:03.759 --> 01:22:07.359
Caption: think of the book it&#39;s ordered by

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.600
Caption: authorities at 111 you have a bunch of

01:22:07.359 --> 01:22:10.879
Caption: other ids there within the source side

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:12.479
Caption: is if i want to find 40 i&#39;m going to

01:22:10.879 --> 01:22:14.959
Caption: have to scan every single author and

01:22:12.479 --> 01:22:16.399
Caption: find 40. at that point the index is

01:22:14.959 --> 01:22:18.718
Caption: useless you might as well just do a

01:22:16.399 --> 01:22:20.158
Caption: sequential scan

01:22:18.719 --> 01:22:22.480
Caption: cool

01:22:20.159 --> 01:22:24.159
Caption: so what are the other options we can

01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:26.000
Caption: databases are cool you can create two

01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:27.760
Caption: single column indexes and it will

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.359
Caption: combine them for you automatically which

01:22:27.759 --> 01:22:31.599
Caption: is pretty incredible

01:22:29.359 --> 01:22:31.600
Caption: okay

01:22:32.399 --> 01:22:36.560
Caption: i&#39;ve skipped something here

01:22:34.959 --> 01:22:38.000
Caption: selectivity and cardinality are two

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:41.439
Caption: concepts and indexes are extremely

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.238
Caption: important so what are they selectivity

01:22:41.439 --> 01:22:43.520
Caption: is

01:22:42.238 --> 01:22:45.759
Caption: give it a a

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:48.159
Caption: a value for um that you&#39;re searching for

01:22:45.759 --> 01:22:50.319
Caption: how many rows does it return as a

01:22:48.159 --> 01:22:52.159
Caption: proportion of the table something like

01:22:50.319 --> 01:22:54.000
Caption: recipe id which is the primary key so

01:22:52.159 --> 01:22:55.439
Caption: it&#39;s unique it&#39;s going to have a very

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.159
Caption: high selectivity because realistically

01:22:55.439 --> 01:22:59.600
Caption: there&#39;s going to be one row with it

01:22:58.159 --> 01:23:01.439
Caption: then you have cardinality and

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:05.199
Caption: cardinality is

01:23:01.439 --> 01:23:07.040
Caption: given a value how many um given a column

01:23:05.199 --> 01:23:08.960
Caption: how many possible values are there for a

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.239
Caption: column so maybe for something like

01:23:08.959 --> 01:23:12.000
Caption: source id

01:23:10.238 --> 01:23:13.678
Caption: that&#39;s going to be a lower cardinality

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.879
Caption: if we have maybe 10 sources that we

01:23:13.679 --> 01:23:17.280
Caption: always get

01:23:14.879 --> 01:23:18.879
Caption: something like recipe id or arthrity

01:23:17.279 --> 01:23:20.799
Caption: will have a very high cardinality

01:23:18.879 --> 01:23:22.718
Caption: because there&#39;s a lot of possible values

01:23:20.799 --> 01:23:25.279
Caption: well okay

01:23:22.719 --> 01:23:26.560
Caption: why is this important

01:23:25.279 --> 01:23:28.959
Caption: essentially

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:30.159
Caption: forgive my absolutely beautiful diagram

01:23:28.959 --> 01:23:32.080
Caption: but

01:23:30.159 --> 01:23:34.719
Caption: when you search on something like source

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:37.120
Caption: id let&#39;s imagine that source id returns

01:23:34.719 --> 01:23:39.760
Caption: roughly half of the table

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:42.320
Caption: okay remember i said it&#39;s a two-step

01:23:39.759 --> 01:23:43.839
Caption: processor you go to the index

01:23:42.319 --> 01:23:46.079
Caption: from the index you get the rest of the

01:23:43.839 --> 01:23:47.759
Caption: information

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.359
Caption: if i&#39;m going to be going through a ha if

01:23:47.759 --> 01:23:51.279
Caption: i&#39;m getting half the values that&#39;s half

01:23:49.359 --> 01:23:52.638
Caption: the index or half the table

01:23:51.279 --> 01:23:54.000
Caption: what&#39;s the point going the index that&#39;s

01:23:52.639 --> 01:23:55.679
Caption: just going to be slower i might as well

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.679
Caption: just go directly to the table and that&#39;s

01:23:55.679 --> 01:24:00.639
Caption: what a database will do

01:23:57.679 --> 01:24:02.320
Caption: the rule of thumb generally is um

01:24:00.639 --> 01:24:04.000
Caption: if you&#39;re returning more than 10 to 15

01:24:02.319 --> 01:24:05.439
Caption: of your table your index is not going to

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.799
Caption: be any good

01:24:05.439 --> 01:24:09.919
Caption: okay

01:24:06.799 --> 01:24:11.279
Caption: know your queries so what does this mean

01:24:09.919 --> 01:24:14.158
Caption: we&#39;ve covered we have the multi-column

01:24:11.279 --> 01:24:16.718
Caption: index which is quite fast we saw

01:24:14.159 --> 01:24:18.320
Caption: we can combine the indexes but we can&#39;t

01:24:16.719 --> 01:24:20.719
Caption: actually because source id an index on

01:24:18.319 --> 01:24:24.560
Caption: source id is kind of useless um it&#39;s

01:24:20.719 --> 01:24:25.600
Caption: pointless it&#39;s not selective enough okay

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.800
Caption: so

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.840
Caption: this is where we think what are our

01:24:26.799 --> 01:24:31.279
Caption: queries okay so

01:24:29.839 --> 01:24:32.879
Caption: and source id

01:24:31.279 --> 01:24:36.638
Caption: how often are we going to be querying

01:24:32.879 --> 01:24:36.638
Caption: author id and then something else

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:41.520
Caption: we talk to product we look at our code

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:43.520
Caption: and we see we do it quite a bit actually

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:46.399
Caption: we do source uh authority and number

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:47.679
Caption: radiance and quite a few bunch of others

01:24:46.399 --> 01:24:49.040
Caption: so we&#39;re not we can&#39;t just create a

01:24:47.679 --> 01:24:51.440
Caption: whole bunch of multi-column indexes

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:53.760
Caption: because that&#39;s pretty inefficient right

01:24:51.439 --> 01:24:55.839
Caption: that&#39;s kind of a waste essentially well

01:24:53.759 --> 01:24:57.519
Caption: there&#39;s a decent middle ground here

01:24:55.839 --> 01:24:59.359
Caption: which is just create an index on

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:01.919
Caption: authority and that will be flexible it

01:24:59.359 --> 01:25:03.919
Caption: will serve all your queries and

01:25:01.919 --> 01:25:06.000
Caption: oops it&#39;s going to be relatively fast

01:25:03.919 --> 01:25:08.479
Caption: it&#39;s still going to be 0.9 milliseconds

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.479
Caption: versus 0.2 keeping in mind without the

01:25:08.479 --> 01:25:11.679
Caption: index at all it was 28 milliseconds

01:25:10.479 --> 01:25:13.839
Caption: that&#39;s still

01:25:11.679 --> 01:25:15.840
Caption: really fast essentially

01:25:13.839 --> 01:25:18.158
Caption: and what you see here what it does is we

01:25:15.839 --> 01:25:20.799
Caption: go to our book i go to the author id 1 1

01:25:18.159 --> 01:25:22.479
Caption: 1 i grab all the values there and then i

01:25:20.799 --> 01:25:24.839
Caption: filter all the values out that don&#39;t

01:25:22.479 --> 01:25:26.399
Caption: meet the source id of

01:25:24.839 --> 01:25:29.279
Caption: 40.

01:25:26.399 --> 01:25:29.279
Caption: cool all right

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.319
Caption: so

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:35.198
Caption: more work

01:25:32.319 --> 01:25:39.279
Caption: we want popular recipes for an author

01:25:35.199 --> 01:25:41.920
Caption: okay kind of submitted before we say

01:25:39.279 --> 01:25:44.079
Caption: author id equals this and num ratings

01:25:41.919 --> 01:25:45.520
Caption: greater than five thousand okay it&#39;s a

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:48.719
Caption: little bit different now instead of two

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:50.879
Caption: qualities we have a range query

01:25:48.719 --> 01:25:53.040
Caption: i&#39;ve created this index here

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:54.399
Caption: it&#39;s actually wrong i&#39;m going to explain

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:56.399
Caption: a little bit why it&#39;s wrong but it&#39;s

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:58.638
Caption: also very deceptive and it can catch you

01:25:56.399 --> 01:26:00.959
Caption: out quite easily in this case

01:25:58.639 --> 01:26:03.840
Caption: this will use the index

01:26:00.959 --> 01:26:06.399
Caption: it&#39;s in 2.8 milliseconds

01:26:03.839 --> 01:26:08.560
Caption: which is pretty reasonable

01:26:06.399 --> 01:26:11.439
Caption: and you think okay that&#39;s good but

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:12.399
Caption: if i create this in the correct order

01:26:11.439 --> 01:26:15.279
Caption: which is

01:26:12.399 --> 01:26:16.879
Caption: the columns are now the other way

01:26:15.279 --> 01:26:18.718
Caption: it was half the time

01:26:16.879 --> 01:26:20.319
Caption: you can imagine if this scales out this

01:26:18.719 --> 01:26:21.520
Caption: is only a million rows it&#39;s just i

01:26:20.319 --> 01:26:23.119
Caption: haven&#39;t really fully randomly

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:24.879
Caption: distributed the data that sort of stuff

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:27.199
Caption: this can scale very quickly and becomes

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:28.560
Caption: extremely um it can become an issue that

01:26:27.199 --> 01:26:30.159
Caption: you will not spot easily you think

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:32.000
Caption: what&#39;s using the index why isn&#39;t it

01:26:30.159 --> 01:26:33.600
Caption: doing it

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.600
Caption: so the way to think about this is you

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.959
Caption: want to reduce the amount of the index

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.639
Caption: to scan

01:26:36.959 --> 01:26:41.198
Caption: so on the left we have the incorrect

01:26:38.639 --> 01:26:42.959
Caption: index and what it does is for i said if

01:26:41.199 --> 01:26:44.239
Caption: you remember for remember from before it

01:26:42.959 --> 01:26:46.639
Caption: will go first it&#39;s going to go num

01:26:44.238 --> 01:26:49.198
Caption: ratings greater than 5 000.

01:26:46.639 --> 01:26:52.320
Caption: it turns out when you do that it scans a

01:26:49.199 --> 01:26:54.239
Caption: decent amount of the index

01:26:52.319 --> 01:26:55.919
Caption: whereas if i want the correct index

01:26:54.238 --> 01:26:57.439
Caption: which is author idea one one one and

01:26:55.919 --> 01:26:59.198
Caption: it&#39;s quite a selective one as we saw

01:26:57.439 --> 01:27:01.359
Caption: before it was only a thousand rows of

01:26:59.199 --> 01:27:02.239
Caption: the whole table well

01:27:01.359 --> 01:27:04.638
Caption: that&#39;s

01:27:02.238 --> 01:27:05.839
Caption: not much of the index it has to scan

01:27:04.639 --> 01:27:07.520
Caption: so that&#39;s going to be much more

01:27:05.839 --> 01:27:09.359
Caption: efficient if you think of the cookbook

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.239
Caption: if i give you numbers grain 5000 go to

01:27:09.359 --> 01:27:12.158
Caption: the book

01:27:10.238 --> 01:27:15.439
Caption: okay number eight it&#39;s like okay 5 000.

01:27:12.159 --> 01:27:17.120
Caption: okay i&#39;ve got a now i know everything

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:18.399
Caption: after that is greater than 5000. i have

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.639
Caption: to scan all of that and figure out where

01:27:18.399 --> 01:27:22.479
Caption: the authority is whereas i go author id

01:27:20.639 --> 01:27:24.000
Caption: one one one i go i find authority one

01:27:22.479 --> 01:27:25.679
Caption: and one one and all my values are there

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.199
Caption: it&#39;s a very small portion of the table

01:27:25.679 --> 01:27:29.679
Caption: we have to scan it&#39;s gonna be more

01:27:27.199 --> 01:27:29.679
Caption: efficient

01:27:30.479 --> 01:27:34.799
Caption: so what to take from that index one of

01:27:32.799 --> 01:27:37.198
Caption: qualities then ranges if you do that you

01:27:34.799 --> 01:27:39.520
Caption: will avoid this issue biting you

01:27:37.199 --> 01:27:40.880
Caption: essentially if you&#39;re lucky um that

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.959
Caption: query before the wrong one it will just

01:27:40.879 --> 01:27:44.399
Caption: do a sequential scan but if you you can

01:27:42.959 --> 01:27:47.198
Caption: see that it can still use the index

01:27:44.399 --> 01:27:49.120
Caption: sometimes and it won&#39;t be as efficient

01:27:47.199 --> 01:27:52.080
Caption: okay

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.520
Caption: can we do this a bit better hmm

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:55.679
Caption: what do i mean by that let&#39;s look at

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:57.919
Caption: this query first of all we&#39;re selecting

01:27:55.679 --> 01:27:59.199
Caption: everything do we need everything

01:27:57.919 --> 01:28:01.120
Caption: i talked to product the product said no

01:27:59.199 --> 01:28:02.400
Caption: no no we just want the recipe id please

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:04.639
Caption: that&#39;s good enough

01:28:02.399 --> 01:28:04.638
Caption: sure

01:28:04.719 --> 01:28:08.880
Caption: okay so reminds me it&#39;s a two-step

01:28:06.959 --> 01:28:11.600
Caption: process right so i need to get all the

01:28:08.879 --> 01:28:13.520
Caption: values that fulfill this filter

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:16.159
Caption: then i need to go to the heap or the

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:17.600
Caption: table um the same thing essentially um

01:28:16.159 --> 01:28:19.760
Caption: then i got a table to get the rest of

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.520
Caption: the row or what i&#39;ve selected

01:28:19.759 --> 01:28:23.439
Caption: what if i could tell

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:25.919
Caption: our query or our index and say hey can

01:28:23.439 --> 01:28:28.718
Caption: you also check recipe id and index and

01:28:25.919 --> 01:28:31.198
Caption: don&#39;t go to the heap and it&#39;ll be faster

01:28:28.719 --> 01:28:33.120
Caption: so that&#39;s called a covering index these

01:28:31.199 --> 01:28:34.320
Caption: are included in postgres 11 and onwards

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.679
Caption: before you have to do a multi-column

01:28:34.319 --> 01:28:37.520
Caption: index which isn&#39;t overly great

01:28:35.679 --> 01:28:38.639
Caption: admittedly but that&#39;s what it kind of

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:40.639
Caption: looks like and we can see here we&#39;ve

01:28:38.639 --> 01:28:42.719
Caption: told hey can you just put risky id with

01:28:40.639 --> 01:28:44.560
Caption: my index please and if you only select

01:28:42.719 --> 01:28:45.679
Caption: on risky id now

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:47.040
Caption: you can do

01:28:45.679 --> 01:28:48.320
Caption: an index scan

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.080
Caption: well actually

01:28:48.319 --> 01:28:51.439
Caption: index only scan

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:54.000
Caption: and that&#39;s the important part to note

01:28:51.439 --> 01:28:56.560
Caption: here it&#39;s saying index only scan we see

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.238
Caption: it took 1.09 seconds it might not seem

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.439
Caption: like a huge improvement here um it&#39;s

01:28:58.238 --> 01:29:01.519
Caption: because it&#39;s on my laptop it&#39;s not a

01:28:59.439 --> 01:29:03.759
Caption: huge amount of data realistically so

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:05.439
Caption: it&#39;s all 20 game this will scale very

01:29:03.759 --> 01:29:07.839
Caption: quickly

01:29:05.439 --> 01:29:10.560
Caption: but one thing you might notice is heap

01:29:07.839 --> 01:29:13.198
Caption: fetches so heaps is a table right

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:16.479
Caption: or zero hair but okay why is that why is

01:29:13.199 --> 01:29:16.479
Caption: there a heap there so

01:29:16.639 --> 01:29:20.560
Caption: essentially what happens is at a very

01:29:19.199 --> 01:29:21.520
Caption: this is a very high level explanation

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:23.280
Caption: just for the records a bit more

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:24.879
Caption: complicated than this when it goes to

01:29:23.279 --> 01:29:26.158
Caption: the index it gets the value and postgre

01:29:24.879 --> 01:29:29.040
Caption: is like hey has this been updated

01:29:26.159 --> 01:29:30.159
Caption: recently and if it turns out if it has

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:32.479
Caption: it has to go to the heap and get this

01:29:30.159 --> 01:29:34.560
Caption: new value so if you updated that row

01:29:32.479 --> 01:29:36.159
Caption: constantly and you run this query it

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:38.399
Caption: will do a bunch of heap fetches which is

01:29:36.159 --> 01:29:41.760
Caption: actually slower than an index scan so

01:29:38.399 --> 01:29:41.759
Caption: that is something to keep in mind

01:29:43.359 --> 01:29:46.799
Caption: okay

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:48.639
Caption: what are

01:29:46.799 --> 01:29:50.479
Caption: what is the relation between time and

01:29:48.639 --> 01:29:51.919
Caption: rating for recipes for long cooking

01:29:50.479 --> 01:29:53.679
Caption: duration so essentially we&#39;re trying to

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:56.319
Caption: look at recipes that take longer than a

01:29:53.679 --> 01:29:58.239
Caption: day and we want to see the worst rated

01:29:56.319 --> 01:30:01.520
Caption: ones for the they have the longest

01:29:58.238 --> 01:30:03.359
Caption: duration something like so

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:04.479
Caption: okay cool

01:30:03.359 --> 01:30:07.520
Caption: so

01:30:04.479 --> 01:30:09.520
Caption: what i mentioned before was

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:10.959
Caption: indexes are ordered

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:12.399
Caption: so if you do a for what they call

01:30:10.959 --> 01:30:14.959
Caption: forward scan it&#39;s like ordering like

01:30:12.399 --> 01:30:17.120
Caption: this backward scans ordering like this

01:30:14.959 --> 01:30:19.600
Caption: what does that mean well

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:21.840
Caption: it means that we can avoid sorting

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.520
Caption: when we do a query which saves us a bit

01:30:21.839 --> 01:30:25.520
Caption: of time

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.080
Caption: okay so let&#39;s show it&#39;s gonna be a bit

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:29.919
Caption: of a wallet that&#39;s all right um

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:31.280
Caption: so you can see here we have a sort key

01:30:29.919 --> 01:30:33.520
Caption: and now it&#39;s so it&#39;s got all these

01:30:31.279 --> 01:30:36.959
Caption: values and then it&#39;s run a sort on it

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:38.399
Caption: and that&#39;s taken 60 milliseconds

01:30:36.959 --> 01:30:39.600
Caption: but if it was ordered already it

01:30:38.399 --> 01:30:42.799
Caption: wouldn&#39;t have to do the saw and it&#39;ll

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:44.479
Caption: come back faster so first things first

01:30:42.799 --> 01:30:46.319
Caption: let&#39;s create the index

01:30:44.479 --> 01:30:50.399
Caption: which of course i put it wrong because

01:30:46.319 --> 01:30:50.399
Caption: this won&#39;t quite work um

01:30:50.639 --> 01:30:54.479
Caption: now it&#39;s down to 37 milliseconds which

01:30:52.319 --> 01:30:55.919
Caption: is a i guess what a decent game but not

01:30:54.479 --> 01:30:57.520
Caption: a huge game

01:30:55.919 --> 01:31:00.319
Caption: and this is where it&#39;s a bit deceptive i

01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:02.479
Caption: can see a sort method there but i also

01:31:00.319 --> 01:31:05.439
Caption: see an index scan

01:31:02.479 --> 01:31:07.679
Caption: okay but why i&#39;ve told it like

01:31:05.439 --> 01:31:09.198
Caption: it&#39;s ordered why why can&#39;t you just give

01:31:07.679 --> 01:31:11.440
Caption: it back to me why do you have to do an

01:31:09.199 --> 01:31:12.880
Caption: extra step i

01:31:11.439 --> 01:31:15.279
Caption: well

01:31:12.879 --> 01:31:16.959
Caption: essentially when you create an index

01:31:15.279 --> 01:31:18.399
Caption: if i create them

01:31:16.959 --> 01:31:20.159
Caption: when i create it without this order here

01:31:18.399 --> 01:31:21.919
Caption: it&#39;s going to create them descending and

01:31:20.159 --> 01:31:24.560
Caption: ascending but

01:31:21.919 --> 01:31:25.839
Caption: databases can&#39;t scan the leading column

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.120
Caption: and one order in the other column in

01:31:25.839 --> 01:31:29.279
Caption: another order

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:31.040
Caption: you have to explicitly define this to be

01:31:29.279 --> 01:31:32.959
Caption: able to do this

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.560
Caption: but it&#39;s worth noting this is an

01:31:32.959 --> 01:31:36.718
Caption: inflexible query

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:39.120
Caption: now you have to use a query like this

01:31:36.719 --> 01:31:41.040
Caption: otherwise at one you won&#39;t be using the

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:43.360
Caption: index efficiently

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:45.199
Caption: now we&#39;ve gone down to 21 milliseconds

01:31:43.359 --> 01:31:47.279
Caption: which is a d quite a decent improvement

01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:48.719
Caption: that was half of the one before

01:31:47.279 --> 01:31:50.319
Caption: which had the index scan but with the

01:31:48.719 --> 01:31:52.000
Caption: sorting this one doesn&#39;t you can see

01:31:50.319 --> 01:31:53.520
Caption: here index condition

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.040
Caption: that you can&#39;t even see anything about

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.479
Caption: um the ordering it just came back

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:59.839
Caption: directly ordered

01:31:56.479 --> 01:31:59.839
Caption: and it&#39;s a lot faster

01:32:00.719 --> 01:32:04.239
Caption: can we do this one better okay

01:32:07.839 --> 01:32:11.520
Caption: our index on cooking time

01:32:09.839 --> 01:32:13.520
Caption: was the first

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.799
Caption: column would we specify when we created

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.679
Caption: this index

01:32:14.799 --> 01:32:17.359
Caption: okay

01:32:15.679 --> 01:32:20.159
Caption: let&#39;s visualize as you can see my

01:32:17.359 --> 01:32:21.839
Caption: beautiful visualization of cooking time

01:32:20.159 --> 01:32:23.280
Caption: it turns out

01:32:21.839 --> 01:32:25.279
Caption: um sorry

01:32:23.279 --> 01:32:27.520
Caption: we are also filtering on greater than or

01:32:25.279 --> 01:32:30.799
Caption: equal to 1440 which is minutes that&#39;s a

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:33.359
Caption: day effectively what does that mean well

01:32:30.799 --> 01:32:34.718
Caption: if i was to represent the values of

01:32:33.359 --> 01:32:36.080
Caption: recipes that take more than a day it&#39;ll

01:32:34.719 --> 01:32:37.840
Caption: be that little tiny black bar at the

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:39.439
Caption: bottom it turns out most recipes take

01:32:37.839 --> 01:32:41.279
Caption: less than a day kind of makes sense

01:32:39.439 --> 01:32:42.639
Caption: right usually your recipe takes around

01:32:41.279 --> 01:32:43.520
Caption: an hour or less

01:32:42.639 --> 01:32:45.280
Caption: okay

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:47.760
Caption: again know your queries i talk to

01:32:45.279 --> 01:32:49.520
Caption: product i look at my code and it turns

01:32:47.759 --> 01:32:51.119
Caption: out that the only query we ever have to

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:52.879
Caption: do a cooking time is checking if it

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:53.679
Caption: takes more than a day

01:32:52.879 --> 01:32:54.799
Caption: okay

01:32:53.679 --> 01:32:56.800
Caption: well

01:32:54.799 --> 01:32:58.319
Caption: do we need to index everything here what

01:32:56.799 --> 01:33:00.959
Caption: if we could just

01:32:58.319 --> 01:33:04.399
Caption: index what we need which is recipes that

01:33:00.959 --> 01:33:06.399
Caption: take longer than a day

01:33:04.399 --> 01:33:08.238
Caption: cool you can see we&#39;ve essentially

01:33:06.399 --> 01:33:10.319
Caption: called what&#39;s called a partial index and

01:33:08.238 --> 01:33:11.839
Caption: all we had to do was put a filter on it

01:33:10.319 --> 01:33:15.520
Caption: after creating the index and that will

01:33:11.839 --> 01:33:17.439
Caption: do all its work for us the database

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:18.719
Caption: so when you use these partial indexes

01:33:17.439 --> 01:33:20.560
Caption: you have to use the filter here

01:33:18.719 --> 01:33:22.080
Caption: otherwise it won&#39;t use the index so they

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.120
Caption: are kind of inflexible in that regard

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:25.600
Caption: that&#39;s where you have to know your

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:25.600
Caption: queries

01:33:26.238 --> 01:33:29.678
Caption: and

01:33:27.199 --> 01:33:31.280
Caption: this time admittedly maybe the the games

01:33:29.679 --> 01:33:33.360
Caption: don&#39;t look as great against my it&#39;s my

01:33:31.279 --> 01:33:35.919
Caption: laptop it&#39;s not a huge data set but it&#39;s

01:33:33.359 --> 01:33:38.238
Caption: still around i think four milliseconds

01:33:35.919 --> 01:33:39.839
Caption: gain off the top of my head so it&#39;s

01:33:38.238 --> 01:33:42.799
Caption: still a decent gain and nothing really

01:33:39.839 --> 01:33:45.599
Caption: changes here um it just uses the index

01:33:42.799 --> 01:33:47.759
Caption: that&#39;s a lot smaller

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:49.840
Caption: so partial index what are they used for

01:33:47.759 --> 01:33:50.879
Caption: we use it here to exclude irrelevant

01:33:49.839 --> 01:33:52.399
Caption: values

01:33:50.879 --> 01:33:54.560
Caption: you can use it to exclude common values

01:33:52.399 --> 01:33:55.919
Caption: so good examples aren&#39;t null

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:58.479
Caption: if you don&#39;t need null values just

01:33:55.919 --> 01:34:00.238
Caption: exclude null values on your index

01:33:58.479 --> 01:34:02.839
Caption: and another example that can come

01:34:00.238 --> 01:34:05.678
Caption: through is we&#39;re doing reports

01:34:02.839 --> 01:34:07.198
Caption: right what if i had a timestamp column

01:34:05.679 --> 01:34:08.560
Caption: and i talked to product and products

01:34:07.199 --> 01:34:10.239
Caption: like actually

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:12.000
Caption: it turns out all our reports only need

01:34:10.238 --> 01:34:13.359
Caption: data from the last three months that&#39;s

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.040
Caption: generally how we do these sorts of

01:34:13.359 --> 01:34:17.040
Caption: things right

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:18.639
Caption: we could exclude all columns that are

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:20.000
Caption: more than three months old have a time

01:34:18.639 --> 01:34:22.239
Caption: center that&#39;s older than three months

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.399
Caption: which would reduce the size of our index

01:34:22.238 --> 01:34:26.399
Caption: and as i said before it must use that

01:34:24.399 --> 01:34:29.120
Caption: filter to find in the index or not use

01:34:26.399 --> 01:34:29.120
Caption: the index at all

01:34:29.839 --> 01:34:33.919
Caption: so

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:35.520
Caption: we need to fix some bugs

01:34:33.919 --> 01:34:37.520
Caption: product has came back to us and they&#39;ve

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:39.679
Caption: kind of been like hey the data is not

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:41.760
Caption: quite matching up we have some queries

01:34:39.679 --> 01:34:44.159
Caption: that fill to one category um there&#39;s

01:34:41.759 --> 01:34:45.919
Caption: this experiment thing that&#39;s a tiny tiny

01:34:44.159 --> 01:34:49.920
Caption: portion of the table so it&#39;s very high

01:34:45.919 --> 01:34:49.919
Caption: selectivity okay no worries

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.679
Caption: i&#39;ll find the one of the queries here

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:55.600
Caption: and it looks something like this

01:34:53.679 --> 01:34:57.440
Caption: um i figure out it&#39;s the casing the

01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:01.840
Caption: casing is not correct okay no worries

01:34:57.439 --> 01:35:01.839
Caption: let&#39;s fix this easily i put on this

01:35:01.919 --> 01:35:06.319
Caption: i deploy it

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.399
Caption: it doesn&#39;t work okay

01:35:06.319 --> 01:35:09.439
Caption: i think while the index is there why is

01:35:08.399 --> 01:35:11.678
Caption: it sequential scanning i don&#39;t

01:35:09.439 --> 01:35:13.279
Caption: understand it it was there right like

01:35:11.679 --> 01:35:15.440
Caption: come on what the hell

01:35:13.279 --> 01:35:18.799
Caption: okay sure

01:35:15.439 --> 01:35:21.198
Caption: what the database sees here is a magic

01:35:18.799 --> 01:35:22.559
Caption: black box it doesn&#39;t know that that

01:35:21.199 --> 01:35:24.000
Caption: function is actually related to the

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:26.560
Caption: experiment at all i can&#39;t figure that

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.479
Caption: out it doesn&#39;t have that information

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:29.919
Caption: so it has to go okay it doesn&#39;t fit the

01:35:28.479 --> 01:35:31.600
Caption: index i am now just going to do a

01:35:29.919 --> 01:35:33.600
Caption: sequential scan sorry

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:35.760
Caption: okay cool

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.520
Caption: we can fix this of course we can we

01:35:35.759 --> 01:35:38.879
Caption: create an index expression index

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:41.359
Caption: function index whatever we want to call

01:35:38.879 --> 01:35:43.439
Caption: it and we put the expression

01:35:41.359 --> 01:35:46.158
Caption: inside the index definition and now

01:35:43.439 --> 01:35:48.639
Caption: we&#39;ve done it we deploy it

01:35:46.159 --> 01:35:51.760
Caption: works all right okay

01:35:48.639 --> 01:35:53.439
Caption: some things to consider here

01:35:51.759 --> 01:35:54.959
Caption: very expensive

01:35:53.439 --> 01:35:57.678
Caption: what happens every time you write to the

01:35:54.959 --> 01:36:00.000
Caption: database that fits this index

01:35:57.679 --> 01:36:01.679
Caption: or if you update a row it will compute

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.520
Caption: the results of that and store it in the

01:36:01.679 --> 01:36:05.679
Caption: index so they&#39;re not very efficient

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.080
Caption: whatsoever

01:36:05.679 --> 01:36:09.600
Caption: in general i have certain indexes uh you

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:12.000
Caption: know increase read speed decrease write

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:14.000
Caption: speed but these are even more heavy so

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.319
Caption: do be careful with them i would don&#39;t

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.560
Caption: use them just because

01:36:16.319 --> 01:36:20.959
Caption: and i&#39;ve used here maybe a bit of a

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:23.199
Caption: contrived example but

01:36:20.959 --> 01:36:25.520
Caption: know your queries so

01:36:23.199 --> 01:36:26.880
Caption: where this can bite you is rrms orms can

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:28.719
Caption: easily bite you here you might only

01:36:26.879 --> 01:36:30.238
Caption: realize it&#39;s putting a lower on your on

01:36:28.719 --> 01:36:32.080
Caption: your query and you think what the hell

01:36:30.238 --> 01:36:34.718
Caption: it&#39;s not using index this is ridiculous

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:35.839
Caption: then you look at rms query like okay i

01:36:34.719 --> 01:36:38.800
Caption: see why

01:36:35.839 --> 01:36:40.879
Caption: um timestamp anything any function

01:36:38.799 --> 01:36:44.799
Caption: postgres function will have the same

01:36:40.879 --> 01:36:44.799
Caption: issue so always so keep that in mind

01:36:46.238 --> 01:36:48.479
Caption: okay

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:52.000
Caption: so we&#39;re kind of getting to the end of

01:36:50.238 --> 01:36:53.359
Caption: this now and we&#39;ve talked we&#39;ve done a

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.439
Caption: bunch of work i&#39;ve shown that kind of

01:36:53.359 --> 01:36:56.959
Caption: query planner very high level um

01:36:55.439 --> 01:36:57.839
Caption: obviously it&#39;s

01:36:56.959 --> 01:36:59.520
Caption: one of those things that gets

01:36:57.839 --> 01:37:02.080
Caption: complicated extremely quick and i was

01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:04.959
Caption: trying to keep this somewhat short

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:07.600
Caption: without going too deep into some things

01:37:04.959 --> 01:37:10.639
Caption: so let&#39;s think okay

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:11.760
Caption: why isn&#39;t your index being used well

01:37:10.639 --> 01:37:13.119
Caption: simply

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:14.959
Caption: the database

01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:15.840
Caption: can&#39;t use the index

01:37:14.959 --> 01:37:19.439
Caption: or

01:37:15.839 --> 01:37:19.439
Caption: it thinks using index is slower

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:22.800
Caption: what are the reasons so i&#39;ve covered a

01:37:21.199 --> 01:37:25.679
Caption: few reasons the first two i haven&#39;t

01:37:22.799 --> 01:37:28.959
Caption: covered so table is too small um rule of

01:37:25.679 --> 01:37:30.719
Caption: thumb if your table is two pages page is

01:37:28.959 --> 01:37:32.639
Caption: eight kilobytes it will not use the

01:37:30.719 --> 01:37:35.840
Caption: index the way you think about it is a

01:37:32.639 --> 01:37:37.280
Caption: five month cookbook has three pages

01:37:35.839 --> 01:37:38.638
Caption: and a one page index what&#39;s going to be

01:37:37.279 --> 01:37:40.479
Caption: faster you just might as well go through

01:37:38.639 --> 01:37:41.520
Caption: a table right i mean through the

01:37:40.479 --> 01:37:43.679
Caption: through the book right it&#39;s gonna be

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:46.399
Caption: faster than going through the index

01:37:43.679 --> 01:37:47.280
Caption: um the operator is another sneaky one so

01:37:46.399 --> 01:37:49.198
Caption: this is something that&#39;s going to be

01:37:47.279 --> 01:37:50.718
Caption: dependent on your database documentation

01:37:49.199 --> 01:37:52.880
Caption: will tell you something off the top of

01:37:50.719 --> 01:37:54.960
Caption: my head would be

01:37:52.879 --> 01:37:57.359
Caption: i like is not supported by b trees and

01:37:54.959 --> 01:37:58.399
Caption: postgres so be wary of those sorts of

01:37:57.359 --> 01:38:00.238
Caption: things

01:37:58.399 --> 01:38:02.560
Caption: and we&#39;ve talked about these which was

01:38:00.238 --> 01:38:04.158
Caption: craig returning too many rows your index

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.600
Caption: is not selective enough it will not use

01:38:04.159 --> 01:38:07.280
Caption: the index

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:09.919
Caption: you&#39;re using your multi-column index

01:38:07.279 --> 01:38:11.919
Caption: incorrectly or even inefficiently

01:38:09.919 --> 01:38:14.158
Caption: and then we have function indexes being

01:38:11.919 --> 01:38:14.839
Caption: used incorrectly

01:38:14.159 --> 01:38:17.920
Caption: but

01:38:14.839 --> 01:38:19.439
Caption: honestly your database knows best yes

01:38:17.919 --> 01:38:20.399
Caption: there are edge cases i haven&#39;t covered

01:38:19.439 --> 01:38:22.319
Caption: them here because they&#39;re quite

01:38:20.399 --> 01:38:24.479
Caption: technical and require quite in-depth

01:38:22.319 --> 01:38:26.799
Caption: knowledge of everything but

01:38:24.479 --> 01:38:28.319
Caption: with my journey with indexes going from

01:38:26.799 --> 01:38:30.559
Caption: someone who didn&#39;t know anything about

01:38:28.319 --> 01:38:32.399
Caption: them at all to now i kind of realized

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:33.919
Caption: database is honestly kind of magic it&#39;s

01:38:32.399 --> 01:38:35.839
Caption: an absolute miracle that these things

01:38:33.919 --> 01:38:37.839
Caption: work as well as they do without any

01:38:35.839 --> 01:38:39.359
Caption: issues it&#39;s we stand on the shoulders of

01:38:37.839 --> 01:38:42.399
Caption: giants when it comes to these things so

01:38:39.359 --> 01:38:42.399
Caption: do keep that in mind

01:38:43.439 --> 01:38:46.238
Caption: okay

01:38:44.799 --> 01:38:48.559
Caption: so i kind of said some of these things

01:38:46.238 --> 01:38:50.000
Caption: i&#39;ve gone surface level um

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:52.239
Caption: gets a bit more complicated which might

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.839
Caption: sound a bit of a cop out i&#39;ve included

01:38:52.238 --> 01:38:55.599
Caption: some stuff here if you&#39;re like i want to

01:38:53.839 --> 01:38:57.279
Caption: learn more please give me more

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.919
Caption: so first thing will be multiversion

01:38:57.279 --> 01:39:01.678
Caption: concurrency control that&#39;s how we update

01:38:59.919 --> 01:39:02.799
Caption: the same table times how to keep things

01:39:01.679 --> 01:39:05.199
Caption: updated

01:39:02.799 --> 01:39:06.238
Caption: um vacuuming is how is kind of related

01:39:05.199 --> 01:39:07.840
Caption: to that

01:39:06.238 --> 01:39:09.678
Caption: and then the last one which is how does

01:39:07.839 --> 01:39:11.599
Caption: your database calculate the statistics

01:39:09.679 --> 01:39:13.440
Caption: and how does it use the statistics and

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:14.800
Caption: query planning and you can add to that

01:39:13.439 --> 01:39:15.839
Caption: understanding the query planner even

01:39:14.799 --> 01:39:18.319
Caption: deeper

01:39:15.839 --> 01:39:19.839
Caption: that was a like yeah ridiculously high

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:22.000
Caption: level overview of the query planner it

01:39:19.839 --> 01:39:24.718
Caption: gets much much much more complicated

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.719
Caption: extremely quick

01:39:25.439 --> 01:39:30.159
Caption: so we&#39;ll look um postgres documentation

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.600
Caption: is actually incredible um it&#39;s very

01:39:30.159 --> 01:39:33.679
Caption: in-depth maybe not the most prettiest

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.359
Caption: thing to read but it does the job

01:39:33.679 --> 01:39:38.719
Caption: there&#39;s a really good site called user

01:39:35.359 --> 01:39:40.319
Caption: index look um like the guy that is a

01:39:38.719 --> 01:39:42.000
Caption: database wizard as far as i&#39;m concerning

01:39:40.319 --> 01:39:43.439
Caption: explains absolutely everything in depth

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.799
Caption: there&#39;s article and everything and it&#39;s

01:39:43.439 --> 01:39:46.799
Caption: really worth giving it a read

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.919
Caption: and

01:39:49.359 --> 01:39:53.118
Caption: yeah so what what what&#39;s the takeaways

01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:54.560
Caption: from this

01:39:53.119 --> 01:39:55.840
Caption: know your queries

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:57.919
Caption: again what are your most important

01:39:55.839 --> 01:39:59.919
Caption: queries most executed queries what are

01:39:57.919 --> 01:40:01.520
Caption: your expensive queries with that

01:39:59.919 --> 01:40:03.678
Caption: knowledge you should be able to judge

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:05.359
Caption: what index you should create

01:40:03.679 --> 01:40:07.280
Caption: what are the traders of you creating the

01:40:05.359 --> 01:40:09.839
Caption: index on the choices that you made from

01:40:07.279 --> 01:40:12.718
Caption: creating that index and from then it&#39;s

01:40:09.839 --> 01:40:12.718
Caption: going to be a bit easier

01:40:13.119 --> 01:40:19.159
Caption: that&#39;s all for today

01:40:15.119 --> 01:40:19.159
Caption: thank you i hope you enjoyed my talk

01:40:25.439 --> 01:40:29.198
Caption: thanks boris and thanks everyone for

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:30.879
Caption: coming i&#39;m happy to take away oh cool

01:40:29.199 --> 01:40:34.760
Caption: okay

01:40:30.879 --> 01:40:34.759
Caption: yeah cool questions

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.919
Caption: uh for the creating the index and using

01:40:41.839 --> 01:40:46.879
Caption: the concurrently keyword is that only

01:40:43.919 --> 01:40:48.399
Caption: for when you&#39;re creating an index after

01:40:46.879 --> 01:40:50.399
Caption: you&#39;ve created the table

01:40:48.399 --> 01:40:51.919
Caption: or yes so you&#39;ll need to create index

01:40:50.399 --> 01:40:53.839
Caption: after table so

01:40:51.919 --> 01:40:55.359
Caption: um you can&#39;t do a migration that creates

01:40:53.839 --> 01:40:58.399
Caption: table and creates index it won&#39;t work

01:40:55.359 --> 01:40:58.399
Caption: you have to do it afterwards

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:07.279
Caption: thanks boris um

01:41:05.439 --> 01:41:08.479
Caption: you said there was a

01:41:07.279 --> 01:41:11.118
Caption: slight

01:41:08.479 --> 01:41:13.040
Caption: hit if you have a if you create an index

01:41:11.119 --> 01:41:15.919
Caption: there&#39;s a increased

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:17.280
Caption: right time in order to build that index

01:41:15.919 --> 01:41:18.959
Caption: do you know

01:41:17.279 --> 01:41:21.198
Caption: sort of what numbers around that we&#39;re

01:41:18.959 --> 01:41:23.520
Caption: talking milliseconds seconds minutes um

01:41:21.199 --> 01:41:25.119
Caption: it&#39;s a very good question

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:27.600
Caption: yeah um i

01:41:25.119 --> 01:41:28.959
Caption: maybe i forgot to put the disclaimer um

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:30.719
Caption: a lot of this stuff

01:41:28.959 --> 01:41:32.639
Caption: it&#39;s hard to quantify because it just

01:41:30.719 --> 01:41:33.840
Caption: depends on a lot of variables what what

01:41:32.639 --> 01:41:35.360
Caption: what&#39;s the machine your database is

01:41:33.839 --> 01:41:37.359
Caption: running on how much data does it has the

01:41:35.359 --> 01:41:39.678
Caption: distribution of the data there&#39;s lots of

01:41:37.359 --> 01:41:41.040
Caption: factors that come into this um

01:41:39.679 --> 01:41:43.040
Caption: so i can&#39;t just give you a percentage

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:44.239
Caption: because it just depends way too much but

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.679
Caption: it will make your right slower and the

01:41:44.238 --> 01:41:47.198
Caption: more indexes you have on a table it&#39;s

01:41:45.679 --> 01:41:49.280
Caption: going to get worse

01:41:47.199 --> 01:41:51.119
Caption: rule of thumb i&#39;ll kind of say if you

01:41:49.279 --> 01:41:52.559
Caption: see more than five indexes on a table

01:41:51.119 --> 01:41:55.560
Caption: it&#39;s a bit smelly that doesn&#39;t look

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.560
Caption: right

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.439
Caption: thanks to talk really enjoyed it i&#39;m

01:42:01.359 --> 01:42:05.040
Caption: just going to ask if you have any really

01:42:03.439 --> 01:42:06.319
Caption: real life examples of how you&#39;ve used

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:08.799
Caption: queries or maybe some of the foot guns

01:42:06.319 --> 01:42:11.599
Caption: you&#39;ve encountered um

01:42:08.799 --> 01:42:14.479
Caption: yeah i do we have a few yeah um one

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:15.520
Caption: example we have a two i can&#39;t give you

01:42:14.479 --> 01:42:17.679
Caption: the numbers off the top of my head

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:19.119
Caption: unfortunately but we have a few well we

01:42:17.679 --> 01:42:20.800
Caption: have one that just would not run out all

01:42:19.119 --> 01:42:22.959
Caption: the queries would not return um

01:42:20.799 --> 01:42:25.279
Caption: completely stopped our processors so i

01:42:22.959 --> 01:42:26.959
Caption: think there&#39;s a two billion row table

01:42:25.279 --> 01:42:29.520
Caption: and we check the index on it and it runs

01:42:26.959 --> 01:42:31.359
Caption: i think in roughly a second now

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:33.279
Caption: and that was it was a simple index too

01:42:31.359 --> 01:42:36.439
Caption: but yeah there&#39;s been a few um things

01:42:33.279 --> 01:42:36.439
Caption: that we&#39;ve done

01:42:43.119 --> 01:42:47.600
Caption: thank you so much um

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:50.879
Caption: i have a question with it&#39;s slightly

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:53.919
Caption: related to index so um it&#39;s

01:42:50.879 --> 01:42:56.560
Caption: to do with the postgres specific random

01:42:53.919 --> 01:42:57.919
Caption: page cost and sequential page yep i

01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:00.399
Caption: think it was random page course and the

01:42:57.919 --> 01:43:01.198
Caption: other was a sequential yeah um have you

01:43:00.399 --> 01:43:04.238
Caption: ever

01:43:01.199 --> 01:43:06.960
Caption: um play with that yep um i kind of

01:43:04.238 --> 01:43:08.158
Caption: avoided it but uh not deliberately um i

01:43:06.959 --> 01:43:09.919
Caption: talked a bit with someone who&#39;s a

01:43:08.159 --> 01:43:11.760
Caption: database god in our company and gave me

01:43:09.919 --> 01:43:13.919
Caption: a bunch of advice so

01:43:11.759 --> 01:43:15.118
Caption: random page cost is well the cost

01:43:13.919 --> 01:43:16.879
Caption: essentially using index because it&#39;s

01:43:15.119 --> 01:43:18.239
Caption: random rather than you know going

01:43:16.879 --> 01:43:20.959
Caption: through the table you&#39;re kind of like

01:43:18.238 --> 01:43:23.198
Caption: randomly going to the table um

01:43:20.959 --> 01:43:24.639
Caption: these days it used to be a bigger issue

01:43:23.199 --> 01:43:26.560
Caption: back in the day with the old hard drives

01:43:24.639 --> 01:43:29.280
Caption: we have ssds now

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:32.719
Caption: the recommendations from the

01:43:29.279 --> 01:43:36.479
Caption: aurora guys people at amazon is you

01:43:32.719 --> 01:43:39.119
Caption: reduce so sorry defaults

01:43:36.479 --> 01:43:41.759
Caption: sequential page cost is one and random

01:43:39.119 --> 01:43:43.600
Caption: is four so the aurora the people aurora

01:43:41.759 --> 01:43:45.198
Caption: actually i recommend or a database for

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:47.199
Caption: aws there you actually recommend

01:43:45.199 --> 01:43:49.040
Caption: dropping your random page across to 1.5

01:43:47.199 --> 01:43:50.800
Caption: or two i believe off the top of my head

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:53.439
Caption: um because we don&#39;t have hard drives

01:43:50.799 --> 01:43:57.040
Caption: that seek on a needle we have ssds which

01:43:53.439 --> 01:43:57.040
Caption: are ridiculously faster essentially

01:44:04.159 --> 01:44:10.159
Caption: do you have any suggestions on how to

01:44:06.399 --> 01:44:14.560
Caption: safely like test indexes in production

01:44:10.159 --> 01:44:17.199
Caption: or like a a system that needs to stay up

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:19.919
Caption: fingers crossed

01:44:17.199 --> 01:44:22.080
Caption: no that&#39;s yes that&#39;s a very hard one and

01:44:19.919 --> 01:44:23.198
Caption: unfortunately it&#39;s just one other

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.479
Caption: so okay

01:44:23.199 --> 01:44:26.800
Caption: there are some ways actually i can give

01:44:24.479 --> 01:44:29.040
Caption: you if you have the same amount of data

01:44:26.799 --> 01:44:30.879
Caption: and dev as in prod the distribution

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:33.119
Caption: needs to be the same too you&#39;ll actually

01:44:30.879 --> 01:44:34.319
Caption: get very similar results not timing wise

01:44:33.119 --> 01:44:36.959
Caption: there are other things you could do

01:44:34.319 --> 01:44:38.399
Caption: which get a bit complicated um buffers

01:44:36.959 --> 01:44:40.799
Caption: is something to look at which is the i o

01:44:38.399 --> 01:44:42.479
Caption: work done but even then

01:44:40.799 --> 01:44:43.919
Caption: it gets even trickier because it&#39;s some

01:44:42.479 --> 01:44:45.199
Caption: things like if i&#39;m running this craze

01:44:43.919 --> 01:44:47.439
Caption: again and again and again you&#39;ll see the

01:44:45.199 --> 01:44:49.199
Caption: times change varying because casein the

01:44:47.439 --> 01:44:51.919
Caption: database cajon actually has cases in

01:44:49.199 --> 01:44:53.440
Caption: operating system um so you can still use

01:44:51.919 --> 01:44:54.879
Caption: it as a judgment core of or be

01:44:53.439 --> 01:44:56.959
Caption: performing or not what you could do if

01:44:54.879 --> 01:44:58.319
Caption: you really want you create the um i

01:44:56.959 --> 01:45:00.718
Caption: don&#39;t know if your company allows this

01:44:58.319 --> 01:45:02.959
Caption: but you can create your index you can

01:45:00.719 --> 01:45:05.199
Caption: log on to the production database create

01:45:02.959 --> 01:45:06.639
Caption: it manually test your query manually if

01:45:05.199 --> 01:45:08.159
Caption: you can bear the load and see if it&#39;ll

01:45:06.639 --> 01:45:09.600
Caption: actually be efficient that&#39;s one way

01:45:08.159 --> 01:45:11.760
Caption: i&#39;ve seen or doing if you&#39;re really not

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.359
Caption: sure but um that comes down to

01:45:11.759 --> 01:45:15.599
Caption: just if you can deploy it to a small

01:45:13.359 --> 01:45:17.198
Caption: subset of customers and just see hey

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:18.719
Caption: what&#39;s the impact here can we and can we

01:45:17.199 --> 01:45:22.119
Caption: roll back quickly

01:45:18.719 --> 01:45:22.119
Caption: that sort of stuff

01:45:30.399 --> 01:45:34.638
Caption: uh i just had a quick question about the

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:37.520
Caption: um specific data types that a database

01:45:34.639 --> 01:45:39.040
Caption: column could have um would indexing um

01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:40.879
Caption: affect that at any point or should i say

01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:43.040
Caption: with the type effect indexing so whether

01:45:40.879 --> 01:45:45.439
Caption: it be a date and time would it be a json

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:48.080
Caption: object yeah yeah um do not create

01:45:45.439 --> 01:45:48.799
Caption: indexes on json

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.800
Caption: uh

01:45:48.799 --> 01:45:52.079
Caption: it&#39;s okay um i know we&#39;ve tried to do it

01:45:50.799 --> 01:45:54.479
Caption: and it&#39;s not very efficient there are

01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:58.000
Caption: other indexes you can use but it&#39;s a bit

01:45:54.479 --> 01:46:00.159
Caption: hard to do from my understanding yes the

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.759
Caption: the size of the the value gets very

01:46:00.159 --> 01:46:03.040
Caption: important this is at a very large scale

01:46:01.759 --> 01:46:04.638
Caption: when you&#39;re talking like billions of

01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:06.639
Caption: billions of rows that&#39;s when if you

01:46:04.639 --> 01:46:08.080
Caption: index on like an int which is i can&#39;t

01:46:06.639 --> 01:46:09.199
Caption: remember what the sizes are postgres

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:10.399
Caption: versus

01:46:09.199 --> 01:46:12.400
Caption: the other ones i can&#39;t remember they&#39;re

01:46:10.399 --> 01:46:14.158
Caption: a bit smaller you can see huge increases

01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:15.678
Caption: in times depending on that and that&#39;s we

01:46:14.159 --> 01:46:17.119
Caption: have to be careful covering indexes like

01:46:15.679 --> 01:46:18.239
Caption: you don&#39;t want to put a json b column of

01:46:17.119 --> 01:46:19.679
Caption: covering index because that&#39;s going to

01:46:18.238 --> 01:46:22.959
Caption: make your index gigantic what&#39;s the

01:46:19.679 --> 01:46:22.959
Caption: point awesome thanks

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:28.239
Caption: outgoing anyone else

01:46:29.679 --> 01:46:31.760
Caption: cool

01:46:30.479 --> 01:46:32.379
Caption: thank you everyone

01:46:31.759 --> 01:46:39.039
Caption: thank you

Caption: [Applause]

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:44.199
Caption: so the next talk starts at 12 20.

Caption: i think it&#39;s detected you

01:52:55.759 --> 01:52:59.839
Caption: ah what&#39;s going on what&#39;s going on

01:53:03.839 --> 01:53:09.959
Caption: just to this morning

01:53:06.479 --> 01:53:09.959
Caption: let&#39;s try that

Caption: cooking right

01:53:17.199 --> 01:53:20.960
Caption: you&#39;re right to try the audio yeah yeah

01:53:23.359 --> 01:53:29.279
Caption: for

01:53:25.119 --> 01:53:29.280
Caption: get used to audio um okay um

01:53:32.479 --> 01:53:35.839
Caption: oh what&#39;s going on there

01:53:34.479 --> 01:53:38.238
Caption: what do you mean check audio normally i

01:53:35.839 --> 01:53:41.479
Caption: just press that it says mute

01:53:38.238 --> 01:53:41.479
Caption: on mute

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:46.719
Caption: or did you want to try and play it or

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.719
Caption: just try and find it

01:53:52.719 --> 01:53:56.480
Caption: do you know hang on let&#39;s try it without

01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.479
Caption: it first

01:54:00.319 --> 01:54:05.040
Caption: i&#39;m saying it&#39;s muted which is really

01:54:01.919 --> 01:54:05.040
Caption: weird all right let&#39;s get out of here

01:54:05.279 --> 01:54:08.279
Caption: hello

01:54:10.879 --> 01:54:14.799
Caption: you probably know max better than me

01:54:11.919 --> 01:54:14.799
Caption: i&#39;ve only had this about a month

01:54:15.679 --> 01:54:20.080
Caption: in the middle yeah i had it um when i

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.439
Caption: was downstairs i muted it

01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.399
Caption: but i normally just press the button on

01:54:21.439 --> 01:54:24.399
Caption: the top and if it goes

01:54:27.119 --> 01:54:30.639
Caption: oh that one there yeah yeah

01:54:28.799 --> 01:54:32.238
Caption: because you&#39;re plugged into the hdmi

01:54:30.639 --> 01:54:34.000
Caption: it&#39;s tracker all right yeah yeah yeah

01:54:32.238 --> 01:54:34.879
Caption: yeah yeah normally

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.080
Caption: yep

01:54:34.879 --> 01:54:39.520
Caption: cool and that&#39;s it so it&#39;ll just

01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:42.789
Caption: all right let&#39;s switch slides

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:42.789
Caption: [Music]

01:54:42.959 --> 01:54:45.759
Caption: um

01:54:43.839 --> 01:54:47.198
Caption: there&#39;s no we have to that audio will

01:54:45.759 --> 01:54:49.678
Caption: come out through the stream though i

01:54:47.199 --> 01:54:51.440
Caption: think when we&#39;re testing it

01:54:49.679 --> 01:54:53.679
Caption: i of course need no introduction yeah

01:54:51.439 --> 01:54:53.678
Caption: abby

01:54:56.399 --> 01:54:59.040
Caption: i&#39;m sorry you guys might take a photo of

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.040
Caption: us

01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:01.919
Caption: do you want to take a photo of me

Caption: because i want to go on one of the

01:55:05.919 --> 01:55:08.799
Caption: slides when i get there

Caption: so my name&#39;s david martin and i&#39;m

02:17:32.638 --> 02:17:38.638
Caption: talking about the use of deep fakes

02:17:35.598 --> 02:17:40.318
Caption: in social media and my journey of um in

02:17:38.638 --> 02:17:42.080
Caption: that space the last sort of nine to 12

02:17:40.319 --> 02:17:43.120

02:19:09.839 --> 02:19:14.398

02:19:21.759 --> 02:19:24.718

Caption: if i can do that too even better

02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:01.599
Caption: and the third component is video content

02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:02.959
Caption: it&#39;s got to be video content if you look

02:20:01.599 --> 02:20:04.959
Caption: at tik tok it&#39;s exploding you know

02:20:02.959 --> 02:20:06.319
Caption: people writing text stories posts

Caption: popular anymore as video content so i

02:20:08.799 --> 02:20:12.719

Caption: i need to make videos

02:20:12.719 --> 02:20:16.000
Caption: so pretty tall order but that&#39;s that&#39;s

02:20:14.639 --> 02:20:17.759
Caption: the challenge i set myself because the

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.359
Caption: other day if i&#39;m launching something i

02:20:17.759 --> 02:20:21.599

02:20:19.359 --> 02:20:23.919
Caption: nowhere right business fails

02:20:21.599 --> 02:20:26.398
Caption: no matter how good it is

02:20:23.919 --> 02:20:28.000
Caption: so today i want to discuss is um just a

02:20:26.399 --> 02:20:30.080
Caption: quick one through social media concepts

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.120
Caption: and numbers just some terms um that

02:20:30.080 --> 02:20:32.560
Caption: you&#39;ve probably heard in social media

02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:33.600
Caption: just explain a bit more and then some

02:20:32.559 --> 02:20:35.119
Caption: numbers around so you get an

02:20:33.599 --> 02:20:36.719
Caption: appreciation of

02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:39.359
Caption: how that works in the social media space

02:20:36.719 --> 02:20:39.358
Caption: and what they mean

02:20:39.759 --> 02:20:43.438
Caption: next thing is data baseline so let&#39;s

02:20:41.439 --> 02:20:45.840
Caption: capture some data from let&#39;s call it my

02:20:43.439 --> 02:20:47.760
Caption: visibility in social media or of this um

02:20:45.839 --> 02:20:49.358
Caption: this blue harvest thing i&#39;d written and

02:20:47.759 --> 02:20:51.358
Caption: how i mean i measure that as a starting

02:20:49.359 --> 02:20:53.520
Caption: point and do i succeed do i get more

02:20:51.359 --> 02:20:55.760
Caption: free marketing

02:20:53.519 --> 02:20:57.279
Caption: and the next piece is deep fakes so

02:20:55.759 --> 02:20:58.559
Caption: that&#39;s the idea of using that video

02:20:57.280 --> 02:20:59.680
Caption: content you know synthetic media is

02:20:58.559 --> 02:21:00.639
Caption: another term and i&#39;ll get into that

02:20:59.679 --> 02:21:02.239
Caption: later

02:21:00.639 --> 02:21:03.919
Caption: but deep fakes how do we use these

02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:05.680
Caption: videos how can we automate video

02:21:03.919 --> 02:21:07.438
Caption: production

02:21:05.679 --> 02:21:08.879
Caption: and the net result did it work did it

02:21:07.439 --> 02:21:10.560
Caption: just tank and did i waste my money my

02:21:08.879 --> 02:21:12.478
Caption: time

02:21:10.559 --> 02:21:14.318
Caption: so let&#39;s get going

02:21:12.478 --> 02:21:16.239
Caption: so first off social media people know

02:21:14.319 --> 02:21:17.680
Caption: what impressions are yeah someone looked

02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:19.120
Caption: at your cat video that&#39;s an impression

02:21:17.679 --> 02:21:20.080
Caption: right picture of your kid that&#39;s an

02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:21.839
Caption: impression

02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:23.280
Caption: engagement

02:21:21.839 --> 02:21:25.919
Caption: yeah that&#39;s when someone press like

02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:27.280
Caption: repost retweet um i can&#39;t think of

02:21:25.919 --> 02:21:29.359
Caption: another nerd but you know those things

02:21:27.280 --> 02:21:30.879
Caption: they&#39;ve interacted with your with your

02:21:29.359 --> 02:21:32.319
Caption: social media content whatever that may

02:21:30.879 --> 02:21:34.478
Caption: be

02:21:32.319 --> 02:21:37.120
Caption: followers yeah you hear influencers bang

02:21:34.478 --> 02:21:38.398
Caption: on about followers so and donald trump

02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:39.600
Caption: will tell you with 90 million of them or

02:21:38.399 --> 02:21:41.200
Caption: used to have

02:21:39.599 --> 02:21:42.879
Caption: when you put out a piece of content

02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:44.799
Caption: immediately all your followers get to

02:21:42.879 --> 02:21:46.799
Caption: see it that&#39;s the first group of people

02:21:44.799 --> 02:21:49.040
Caption: that see it then after you after they

02:21:46.799 --> 02:21:51.280
Caption: like retweet whatever then out it goes

02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:53.120
Caption: so really followers help you project

02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:54.799
Caption: your post so really increasing followers

02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:56.639
Caption: and some people pay for them is very

02:21:54.799 --> 02:21:58.160
Caption: important so that&#39;s another level to

02:21:56.639 --> 02:21:59.919
Caption: consider

02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:02.399
Caption: and the last thing i want to um explain

02:21:59.919 --> 02:22:03.839
Caption: there is organic versus paid so organic

02:22:02.399 --> 02:22:06.319
Caption: is you taking a picture of your cat and

02:22:03.839 --> 02:22:08.240
Caption: sticking it on wherever it was instagram

02:22:06.319 --> 02:22:10.879
Caption: whereas paid some people pay content

02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:12.240
Caption: writers advertising um the company i

02:22:10.879 --> 02:22:13.759
Caption: work for actually does that sort of

02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:15.759
Caption: stuff make social media posts for

02:22:13.759 --> 02:22:17.839
Caption: companies um so there&#39;s a whole market

02:22:15.759 --> 02:22:19.919
Caption: in that space and can be quite expensive

02:22:17.839 --> 02:22:22.398
Caption: even simple text posts with photos take

02:22:19.919 --> 02:22:24.240
Caption: money and time

02:22:22.399 --> 02:22:26.399
Caption: so engagement rates which you heard me

02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:28.399
Caption: just discussed previously so just keep

02:22:26.399 --> 02:22:30.080
Caption: the math simple twitter&#39;s at one percent

02:22:28.399 --> 02:22:32.720
Caption: that&#39;s considered a good engagement rate

02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:34.479
Caption: oh sorry my slides are now out of it

02:22:32.719 --> 02:22:36.639
Caption: that&#39;s a good engagement rate so what

02:22:34.478 --> 02:22:39.358
Caption: that means is if you had 100 people see

02:22:36.639 --> 02:22:42.559
Caption: your your cat tweet and one person hit

02:22:39.359 --> 02:22:44.560
Caption: like or retweet or whatever that&#39;s good

02:22:42.559 --> 02:22:46.719
Caption: right that&#39;s considered a good number i

02:22:44.559 --> 02:22:48.000
Caption: know sounds crappy but it&#39;s good

02:22:46.719 --> 02:22:50.318
Caption: and you can see along there there&#39;s

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:52.319
Caption: linkedin at 6 and so on so forth so just

02:22:50.319 --> 02:22:54.879
Caption: to keep the maths easy one person 100 is

02:22:52.319 --> 02:22:56.720
Caption: considered success on twitter

02:22:54.879 --> 02:22:58.959
Caption: so next piece is how much are people

02:22:56.719 --> 02:23:01.200
Caption: spending on marketing

02:22:58.959 --> 02:23:03.040
Caption: so twitter 1.4 billion dollars in

02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:06.240
Caption: advertising

02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:08.799
Caption: profit last calendar year us

02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:11.680
Caption: facebook at 50 billion and number number

02:23:08.799 --> 02:23:13.679
Caption: one is google 200 billion dollars in

02:23:11.679 --> 02:23:15.919
Caption: advertising so it&#39;s a fair whack of

02:23:13.679 --> 02:23:19.839
Caption: money and if i can avoid giving them any

02:23:15.919 --> 02:23:19.839
Caption: more i um certainly would try

02:23:19.919 --> 02:23:24.000
Caption: so video content so what are some stats

02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:25.200
Caption: around video content what what makes us

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:27.759
Caption: so popular

02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:29.439
Caption: so the first thing is 78 of people watch

02:23:27.759 --> 02:23:31.519
Caption: online videos every week and that&#39;s in

02:23:29.439 --> 02:23:34.560
Caption: some form whether it&#39;s you know autoplay

02:23:31.519 --> 02:23:36.159
Caption: on twitter or tick tock whatever um it&#39;s

02:23:34.559 --> 02:23:38.719
Caption: it&#39;s incredibly popular

02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:40.080
Caption: the next two thing uh next stat is 72

02:23:38.719 --> 02:23:41.919
Caption: percent of customers rather learn this

02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:43.040
Caption: way so let&#39;s think of my dad building

02:23:41.919 --> 02:23:44.719
Caption: his lawnmower he just bought the other

02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:46.799
Caption: week we found a video online on how to

02:23:44.719 --> 02:23:48.318
Caption: build it because reading a manual sucks

02:23:46.799 --> 02:23:50.318
Caption: whereas if someone shows you how to do

02:23:48.319 --> 02:23:52.800
Caption: it you can always learn faster and

02:23:50.319 --> 02:23:54.879
Caption: acquire the skills or knowledge faster

02:23:52.799 --> 02:23:57.040
Caption: the next one is message retention more

02:23:54.879 --> 02:24:01.160
Caption: people remember the message you put in a

02:23:57.040 --> 02:24:01.160
Caption: video than a piece of text

02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:04.319
Caption: and finally more businesses are doing it

02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:06.000
Caption: it&#39;s going up every year and probably

02:24:04.319 --> 02:24:07.359
Caption: it&#39;s a it&#39;s a self-fulfilling thing you

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.879
Caption: see tick tock being populous people

02:24:07.359 --> 02:24:10.720
Caption: trying to get on tick tock causes more

02:24:08.879 --> 02:24:13.200

Caption: experiment um

02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:59.280

02:26:57.919 --> 02:27:01.120
Caption: high level of engagement with certain

02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:03.520

Caption: the three tweets

02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:22.080
Caption: but a low engagement rate so it really

02:27:20.799 --> 02:27:23.120
Caption: depends on marketing do you want people

02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:24.160
Caption: engaging their content or do you want

02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:25.439

02:27:32.719 --> 02:27:37.120
Caption: mns is one i just showed

Caption: actors and this they are paid okay

02:29:05.839 --> 02:29:09.438
Caption: they&#39;re paid to use their likeness so

02:29:07.919 --> 02:29:11.120
Caption: there&#39;s very strict rules or ethics

02:29:09.439 --> 02:29:12.160

Caption: police that there&#39;s a lot of content

02:29:17.839 --> 02:29:20.959

02:29:25.359 --> 02:29:27.680
Caption: so it&#39;s very important all this and

02:29:26.639 --> 02:29:30.000

Caption: deep fake and digital twin so there&#39;s i

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:33.599

Caption: yeah most common stuff but that&#39;s the

02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:41.439
Caption: big difference here is we use digital

02:29:39.679 --> 02:29:42.719
Caption: twins which most people know is deep

02:29:41.439 --> 02:29:44.960
Caption: fakes but that&#39;s that&#39;s a very important

Caption: difference there

Caption: of things do at a very low price

02:31:01.280 --> 02:31:04.399

Caption: what were the results

02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:09.439
Caption: was it worth it

02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:11.120
Caption: stamped into the whole 20 minute talk

02:31:09.439 --> 02:31:12.720
Caption: with the video but i changed my mind

02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:14.240

02:31:19.839 --> 02:31:22.240
Caption: i wasting my time i always believe

Caption: learning something new is not a waste of

02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:27.520
Caption: time but nonetheless

02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:29.839
Caption: so tweet only text 0.63 well below the

02:31:27.519 --> 02:31:32.000
Caption: one percent that they say is good video

02:31:29.839 --> 02:31:34.080
Caption: tweets three point nine nine and that&#39;s

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Caption: just those top 20 companies now the

02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:37.520
Caption: thing is that constantly changes as

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:39.679
Caption: engagement changes for those stocks the

02:31:37.519 --> 02:31:40.639
Caption: top 20 is dynamic it&#39;ll pick whatever&#39;s

02:31:39.679 --> 02:31:42.478

Caption: other day but nonetheless it changes all

02:31:43.919 --> 02:31:47.519
Caption: the time based on traffic which is great

02:31:46.799 --> 02:31:50.160
Caption: so

02:31:47.519 --> 02:31:51.839

02:31:57.919 --> 02:32:01.040
Caption: the big one for me there and i didn&#39;t

02:31:59.759 --> 02:32:02.559
Caption: know that until i did the chart so i was

02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:04.399
Caption: quite impressed

02:32:02.559 --> 02:32:06.559
Caption: the next one very quickly

02:32:04.399 --> 02:32:07.840

Caption: followers you know 1100 compared to 16

Caption: devops

02:46:29.439 --> 02:46:33.760

02:46:31.759 --> 02:46:35.519
Caption: sorry on github

02:46:33.759 --> 02:46:37.200

02:46:35.519 --> 02:46:38.799
Caption: planning and tracking all the way

02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:40.240
Caption: through to the inner loop like actually

02:46:38.799 --> 02:46:42.879
Caption: writing code

02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:43.839
Caption: in the cloud on code spaces

02:46:42.879 --> 02:46:45.599
Caption: and then

02:46:43.839 --> 02:46:47.679
Caption: actions to deploy

02:46:45.599 --> 02:46:48.959
Caption: like with a ci cd pipeline all the way

02:46:47.679 --> 02:46:50.000
Caption: through to the end

02:46:48.959 --> 02:46:51.438
Caption: right

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:53.359
Caption: now

02:46:51.439 --> 02:46:55.359
Caption: i started about 15 minutes late so let&#39;s

02:46:53.359 --> 02:46:56.959
Caption: see how quickly we can do this if i skip

02:46:55.359 --> 02:46:58.399
Caption: over stuff and you&#39;re like i really want

02:46:56.959 --> 02:47:00.478
Caption: to know more about that

02:46:58.399 --> 02:47:02.080
Caption: we have all of this demo stuff at the

02:47:00.478 --> 02:47:03.599
Caption: github booth as well so come and have a

02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:04.719
Caption: look the difference in the github booth

02:47:03.599 --> 02:47:06.559
Caption: though is that everything&#39;s running off

02:47:04.719 --> 02:47:08.080
Caption: a raspberry pi so i&#39;m doing

02:47:06.559 --> 02:47:09.839
Caption: multi-container

02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:12.080
Caption: development debugging and stuff but my

02:47:09.839 --> 02:47:14.959
Caption: dev machines this raspberry pi hanging

02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:16.879
Caption: from a carabiner next to the tv

02:47:14.959 --> 02:47:18.879
Caption: we&#39;ll see some of that in a sec not the

02:47:16.879 --> 02:47:21.679
Caption: raspberry pi but the code spaces right

02:47:18.879 --> 02:47:22.639
Caption: so devops you&#39;ve all seen that kind of

02:47:21.679 --> 02:47:25.278
Caption: uh

02:47:22.639 --> 02:47:26.879
Caption: sideways eight like the infinity symbol

02:47:25.279 --> 02:47:29.439
Caption: that we talk about with devops where we

02:47:26.879 --> 02:47:31.759
Caption: do plan you know build

02:47:29.439 --> 02:47:33.439
Caption: deploy and then learn from that

02:47:31.759 --> 02:47:35.519
Caption: the idea with devops being that you can

02:47:33.439 --> 02:47:37.200
Caption: get through that whole like

02:47:35.519 --> 02:47:38.559
Caption: infinity symbol as quickly as possible

02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:40.080
Caption: so get stuff out to production as

02:47:38.559 --> 02:47:41.759
Caption: quickly as possible so you can learn

02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:44.479
Caption: from it and work out what needs to be

02:47:41.759 --> 02:47:45.919
Caption: done next right

02:47:44.478 --> 02:47:47.759
Caption: what i&#39;m going to focus on today is

02:47:45.919 --> 02:47:49.438
Caption: everything from the plan bit all the way

02:47:47.759 --> 02:47:51.200
Caption: through to production right we&#39;re not

02:47:49.439 --> 02:47:53.120
Caption: really going to talk so much about the

02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:55.600
Caption: learning from it

02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:57.520
Caption: github doesn&#39;t have a product for

02:47:55.599 --> 02:47:58.959
Caption: for you know looking at metrics of

02:47:57.519 --> 02:48:01.278
Caption: things that are going on in production

02:47:58.959 --> 02:48:03.200
Caption: we do have awesome kind of tooling

02:48:01.279 --> 02:48:04.800
Caption: around discussions with your communities

02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:06.640
Caption: and of course there&#39;s github issues that

02:48:04.799 --> 02:48:08.318
Caption: can be open so

02:48:06.639 --> 02:48:10.398
Caption: the community can contribute as well or

02:48:08.319 --> 02:48:12.000
Caption: your customers can contribute as well to

02:48:10.399 --> 02:48:13.600
Caption: what you&#39;re doing but we&#39;re not going to

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.839
Caption: really cover that that part so much

02:48:13.599 --> 02:48:17.040
Caption: beyond just

02:48:14.839 --> 02:48:19.200
Caption: issues all right i&#39;m already talking too

02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:20.240
Caption: much let&#39;s go and have a look you can

02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:21.600
Caption: see a little bit about some of the

02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:22.799
Caption: security stuff that&#39;s built in here as

02:48:21.599 --> 02:48:25.358
Caption: well um

02:48:22.799 --> 02:48:27.120
Caption: dependebot has told me that my code has

02:48:25.359 --> 02:48:29.279
Caption: security vulnerabilities

02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:30.319
Caption: which is deliberate i promise

02:48:29.279 --> 02:48:32.319
Caption: i&#39;m just going to ignore them at the

02:48:30.319 --> 02:48:34.399
Caption: moment which is also deliberate

02:48:32.319 --> 02:48:35.919
Caption: oh this is going to be fun your scroll

02:48:34.399 --> 02:48:38.080
Caption: thing&#39;s the reverse of what i usually

02:48:35.919 --> 02:48:38.080
Caption: use

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.200
Caption: yeah

02:48:40.879 --> 02:48:46.240
Caption: i&#39;m playing in hard mode alright

02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:48.879
Caption: who is familiar with github issues

02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:50.959
Caption: yep okay cool if you&#39;re not github

02:48:48.879 --> 02:48:52.959
Caption: issues is kind of the way that we track

02:48:50.959 --> 02:48:55.759
Caption: a piece of work so

02:48:52.959 --> 02:48:57.279
Caption: issues uh the word issue as we use it is

02:48:55.759 --> 02:49:01.120
Caption: a thing that we need to care about

02:48:57.279 --> 02:49:03.919
Caption: ultimately it&#39;s fine i&#39;ll work it out um

02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:06.319
Caption: okay oh yeah um it&#39;s it&#39;s a thing we

02:49:03.919 --> 02:49:08.240
Caption: need to care about right it&#39;s not

02:49:06.319 --> 02:49:09.439
Caption: a bug it&#39;s not a synonym for a bug

02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:12.080
Caption: although you can absolutely track your

02:49:09.439 --> 02:49:14.399
Caption: bugs using github issues we use issues

02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:15.120
Caption: internally for everything at github so

02:49:14.399 --> 02:49:17.520
Caption: we

02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:19.759
Caption: in our devrel organization we have a

02:49:17.519 --> 02:49:21.919
Caption: repository that has very little code in

02:49:19.759 --> 02:49:23.919
Caption: it but we use issues to track all of the

02:49:21.919 --> 02:49:25.279
Caption: work that everybody is doing

02:49:23.919 --> 02:49:26.559
Caption: the whole way through and you&#39;ll see

02:49:25.279 --> 02:49:28.720
Caption: some of the planning and tracking tools

02:49:26.559 --> 02:49:30.079
Caption: and why it&#39;s it&#39;s valuable to do that

02:49:28.719 --> 02:49:31.679
Caption: regardless of whether they&#39;re actual

02:49:30.080 --> 02:49:32.879
Caption: pieces of code that you need to change

02:49:31.679 --> 02:49:35.919
Caption: or not

02:49:32.879 --> 02:49:37.839
Caption: so the github issues um ui when you go

02:49:35.919 --> 02:49:39.279
Caption: to the issues tab in github

02:49:37.839 --> 02:49:40.559
Caption: you&#39;ll just get this list of all of the

02:49:39.279 --> 02:49:42.080
Caption: issues that are in there you know

02:49:40.559 --> 02:49:43.759
Caption: categorized by open and closed you can

02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:45.520
Caption: do some great searching and filtering

02:49:43.759 --> 02:49:47.599
Caption: and stuff like that apply labels all

02:49:45.519 --> 02:49:49.839
Caption: that kind of thing um

02:49:47.599 --> 02:49:52.000
Caption: and so the the experience with actually

02:49:49.839 --> 02:49:54.799
Caption: creating issues and using issues is

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:56.319
Caption: pretty good too so if we create an issue

02:49:54.799 --> 02:49:58.639
Caption: um

02:49:56.319 --> 02:50:03.200
Caption: you know you can give it a title uh

02:49:58.639 --> 02:50:04.478
Caption: what&#39;s the title fix that laptop output

02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:05.680
Caption: which is a good one

02:50:04.478 --> 02:50:07.199
Caption: um

02:50:05.679 --> 02:50:09.679
Caption: and then you can you know put a whole

02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:10.640
Caption: lot of detail about um

02:50:09.679 --> 02:50:12.559
Caption: stuff

02:50:10.639 --> 02:50:14.559
Caption: what&#39;s the screenshot in windows windows

02:50:12.559 --> 02:50:16.398
Caption: shift s

02:50:14.559 --> 02:50:17.679
Caption: yeah

02:50:16.399 --> 02:50:19.040
Caption: i&#39;m a pro

02:50:17.679 --> 02:50:20.839
Caption: um

02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:24.240
Caption: you can even do things like paste

02:50:20.839 --> 02:50:26.240
Caption: images wrong keys

02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:28.799
Caption: you can even like copy and paste images

02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:30.160
Caption: so i just took a screenshot

02:50:28.799 --> 02:50:32.639
Caption: and then

02:50:30.160 --> 02:50:33.759
Caption: the preview can see that screenshot that

02:50:32.639 --> 02:50:35.519
Caption: i just took

02:50:33.759 --> 02:50:38.559
Caption: so you can copy paste

02:50:35.519 --> 02:50:40.159
Caption: images you can do rich markdown

02:50:38.559 --> 02:50:42.159
Caption: formatting all that kind of stuff

02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:44.799
Caption: there&#39;s some really good features around

02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:48.000
Caption: task lists too so you can set a list of

02:50:44.799 --> 02:50:48.000
Caption: you know things you need to do

02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:50.799
Caption: a second thing

02:50:49.519 --> 02:50:52.879
Caption: and then

02:50:50.799 --> 02:50:55.438
Caption: when you save or submit that issue just

02:50:52.879 --> 02:50:56.879
Caption: get rid of that last one

02:50:55.439 --> 02:50:59.439
Caption: you can see that there&#39;s a task list

02:50:56.879 --> 02:51:02.000
Caption: attached to this issue as well

02:50:59.439 --> 02:51:04.319
Caption: and we can see that there are two tasks

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:05.519
Caption: for that issue that need to be done and

02:51:04.319 --> 02:51:07.279
Caption: maybe i want to

02:51:05.519 --> 02:51:08.639
Caption: say i&#39;ve done the first thing

02:51:07.279 --> 02:51:11.520
Caption: but maybe the second thing needs a

02:51:08.639 --> 02:51:13.199
Caption: little bit more work and so i can

02:51:11.519 --> 02:51:14.719
Caption: just need to refresh

02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:15.919
Caption: wrong buttons

02:51:14.719 --> 02:51:17.358
Caption: f5

02:51:15.919 --> 02:51:20.160
Caption: no that&#39;s all right

02:51:17.359 --> 02:51:22.160
Caption: see this is why i have a desktop pc at

02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:22.879
Caption: home and a macbook so i know both of

02:51:22.160 --> 02:51:25.439
Caption: them

02:51:22.879 --> 02:51:26.719
Caption: anyway so this second one maybe i want

02:51:25.439 --> 02:51:28.000
Caption: to actually convert that to an issue

02:51:26.719 --> 02:51:30.160
Caption: because it needs some more expansion

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:31.679
Caption: there&#39;s some more details when i do that

02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:34.319
Caption: it&#39;ll create an issue from that second

02:51:31.679 --> 02:51:36.559
Caption: thing and if i drill into that issue

02:51:34.319 --> 02:51:37.919
Caption: we can see that that is tracked in one

02:51:36.559 --> 02:51:40.318
Caption: of the previous issues so we have this

02:51:37.919 --> 02:51:41.919
Caption: kind of hierarchy the hierarchy stuff in

02:51:40.319 --> 02:51:44.319
Caption: github issues is still kind of being

02:51:41.919 --> 02:51:46.639
Caption: built out it will be a lot richer in the

02:51:44.319 --> 02:51:49.040
Caption: future um right now we we kind of do

02:51:46.639 --> 02:51:50.559
Caption: have this hierarchy between

02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:51.839
Caption: and you can go down as deep as you want

02:51:50.559 --> 02:51:53.278
Caption: if i did a task list in this and

02:51:51.839 --> 02:51:55.679
Caption: converted them to issues you can see

02:51:53.279 --> 02:51:57.279
Caption: that it&#39;s tracked in those ones as well

02:51:55.679 --> 02:51:58.318
Caption: that stuff will start surfacing a bit

02:51:57.279 --> 02:51:59.439
Caption: more

02:51:58.319 --> 02:52:01.200
Caption: soon

02:51:59.439 --> 02:52:02.960
Caption: so we&#39;ve got our issues uh we can do

02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:05.520
Caption: real really rich markdown we can even do

02:52:02.959 --> 02:52:06.799
Caption: like mathematical formulas and we use um

02:52:05.519 --> 02:52:08.478
Caption: tooling to

02:52:06.799 --> 02:52:10.478
Caption: do flow charts and stuff like that you

02:52:08.478 --> 02:52:12.239
Caption: can put in there in markdown it&#39;s this

02:52:10.478 --> 02:52:14.799
Caption: github flavored markdown that we have

02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:16.879
Caption: which is a little bit richer

02:52:14.799 --> 02:52:18.879
Caption: but this probably isn&#39;t the best way to

02:52:16.879 --> 02:52:20.799
Caption: like manage all of your issues you might

02:52:18.879 --> 02:52:22.639
Caption: have thousands of issues

02:52:20.799 --> 02:52:23.759
Caption: you can&#39;t really run a sprint just by

02:52:22.639 --> 02:52:25.599
Caption: well you can

02:52:23.759 --> 02:52:27.599
Caption: run a sprint by just applying a label to

02:52:25.599 --> 02:52:29.040
Caption: that issue for sprint one and then just

02:52:27.599 --> 02:52:30.559
Caption: filtering to those labels it&#39;s not the

02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:32.240
Caption: best way to work

02:52:30.559 --> 02:52:35.519
Caption: so we&#39;ve got issues sorry we&#39;ve got

02:52:32.240 --> 02:52:37.120
Caption: github projects now github projects is

02:52:35.519 --> 02:52:39.438
Caption: new

02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:42.160
Caption: if you have used github projects in the

02:52:39.439 --> 02:52:44.479
Caption: past you might have used the the legacy

02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:46.319
Caption: projects which we&#39;ve now deprecated

02:52:44.478 --> 02:52:47.759
Caption: there is a really nice migration path

02:52:46.319 --> 02:52:49.600
Caption: from the old projects to the new

02:52:47.759 --> 02:52:50.959
Caption: projects um

02:52:49.599 --> 02:52:52.398
Caption: mitch just did a video on that really

02:52:50.959 --> 02:52:55.679
Caption: recently i don&#39;t know how where we&#39;ve

02:52:52.399 --> 02:52:55.680
Caption: have we published it on youtube

02:52:55.759 --> 02:52:58.639
Caption: on instagram today there we go

02:52:57.839 --> 02:53:00.559
Caption: um

02:52:58.639 --> 02:53:01.519
Caption: and so i&#39;m going to create a new project

02:53:00.559 --> 02:53:02.959
Caption: uh

02:53:01.519 --> 02:53:05.679
Caption: i&#39;m going to go to the organization to

02:53:02.959 --> 02:53:05.679
Caption: create a project

02:53:05.839 --> 02:53:12.080
Caption: uh where are we new project

02:53:08.799 --> 02:53:13.919
Caption: and we&#39;ll call it dddd perth now i can

02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:16.479
Caption: choose one of the templates for these

02:53:13.919 --> 02:53:17.839
Caption: projects or i can just go from scratch

02:53:16.478 --> 02:53:20.478
Caption: i&#39;m just going to go from scratch just

02:53:17.839 --> 02:53:22.398
Caption: to show you how powerful this is

02:53:20.478 --> 02:53:24.719
Caption: and i&#39;m going to add the issues from my

02:53:22.399 --> 02:53:26.160
Caption: repository so to do that

02:53:24.719 --> 02:53:27.839
Caption: by the way we&#39;re looking at the table

02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:31.040
Caption: view at the moment

02:53:27.839 --> 02:53:32.000
Caption: to add an issue i choose my repository

02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:34.160
Caption: uh

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:36.839
Caption: it&#39;s high queues for code spaces

02:53:34.160 --> 02:53:40.000
Caption: and then i&#39;m just gonna

02:53:36.839 --> 02:53:42.000
Caption: choose yeah that one

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:45.040
Caption: so now i have that issue in there

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:46.478
Caption: oh this thing&#39;s hurting me

02:53:45.040 --> 02:53:48.559
Caption: um

02:53:46.478 --> 02:53:51.879
Caption: and i can add

02:53:48.559 --> 02:53:51.879
Caption: left click

02:53:53.120 --> 02:53:56.959
Caption: we&#39;ve also made this quite like keyboard

02:53:55.519 --> 02:53:58.879
Caption: friendly so i&#39;m just kind of hitting

02:53:56.959 --> 02:54:01.200
Caption: enter and it&#39;s taking the top one each

02:53:58.879 --> 02:54:02.799
Caption: time just to fill them out

02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:04.080
Caption: and we&#39;ve now got this

02:54:02.799 --> 02:54:05.839
Caption: list of

02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:06.879
Caption: you know issues that we&#39;re working with

02:54:05.839 --> 02:54:08.719
Caption: we&#39;ve got our columns we&#39;ve got

02:54:06.879 --> 02:54:11.040
Caption: assignees we&#39;ve got the status of those

02:54:08.719 --> 02:54:14.398
Caption: issues as well now status is something

02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:14.399
Caption: that belongs to the board

02:54:15.359 --> 02:54:19.600
Caption: so by default you get to do in progress

02:54:17.679 --> 02:54:21.679
Caption: and done but i can change those statuses

02:54:19.599 --> 02:54:24.159
Caption: i can have whatever statuses i want but

02:54:21.679 --> 02:54:26.799
Caption: i can also have custom fields in here

02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:28.319
Caption: so i can say i want to see the labels

02:54:26.799 --> 02:54:30.080
Caption: that&#39;s great that&#39;s pretty useful but i

02:54:28.319 --> 02:54:31.600
Caption: want a new field for

02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:35.759
Caption: an estimate

02:54:31.599 --> 02:54:37.438
Caption: and then that field type is a number

02:54:35.759 --> 02:54:38.160
Caption: and now we have this estimate column as

02:54:37.439 --> 02:54:41.120
Caption: well

02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:43.120
Caption: so i&#39;m just going to go and put some

02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:45.600
Caption: random numbers in that estimate column

02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:46.959
Caption: if i can work things

02:54:45.599 --> 02:54:48.559
Caption: i&#39;m putting random numbers in because

02:54:46.959 --> 02:54:52.160
Caption: this is like a real life demo where

02:54:48.559 --> 02:54:52.159
Caption: estimates are totally random anyway

02:54:52.639 --> 02:54:56.799
Caption: and then i can obviously do things like

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:59.279
Caption: filter and say i only want to see the

02:54:56.799 --> 02:55:01.679
Caption: estimates that are greater than five oh

02:54:59.279 --> 02:55:04.319
Caption: keyboard shortcuts

02:55:01.679 --> 02:55:05.199
Caption: the opposite so ctrl k on windows by the

02:55:04.319 --> 02:55:09.040
Caption: way no

02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:11.279
Caption: not windows k um and i can filter by

02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:13.679
Caption: you know um

02:55:11.279 --> 02:55:15.760
Caption: here we go estimate and just say it has

02:55:13.679 --> 02:55:18.000
Caption: to be greater than five and it&#39;ll filter

02:55:15.759 --> 02:55:19.839
Caption: based on those so we can do that we can

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:22.639
Caption: group by

02:55:19.839 --> 02:55:24.879
Caption: the statuses grouped by the labels uh

02:55:22.639 --> 02:55:27.759
Caption: let&#39;s group by actually we need another

02:55:24.879 --> 02:55:27.759
Caption: field here for

02:55:28.839 --> 02:55:34.719
Caption: sprint and this is actually a iteration

02:55:32.399 --> 02:55:34.720
Caption: type

02:55:35.599 --> 02:55:39.199
Caption: and it starts today iterations go for

02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:40.959
Caption: two weeks

02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:42.719
Caption: so in the background it&#39;s created some

02:55:40.959 --> 02:55:43.599
Caption: iterations for me based on every two

02:55:42.719 --> 02:55:45.919
Caption: weeks

02:55:43.599 --> 02:55:48.959
Caption: and i can assign these to these sprints

02:55:45.919 --> 02:55:48.959
Caption: as we go as well so

02:55:50.719 --> 02:55:53.519
Caption: yeah let&#39;s do that

02:55:55.759 --> 02:56:00.559
Caption: and then we&#39;ll

02:55:57.679 --> 02:56:02.639
Caption: group by these

02:56:00.559 --> 02:56:04.159
Caption: so now we&#39;ve got all of our sprint one

02:56:02.639 --> 02:56:06.799
Caption: sprint two sprint three and then the

02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:09.679
Caption: ones that haven&#39;t been

02:56:06.799 --> 02:56:09.679
Caption: haven&#39;t been done yet

02:56:09.759 --> 02:56:12.719
Caption: so we got this like nice little table

02:56:11.519 --> 02:56:13.839
Caption: view

02:56:12.719 --> 02:56:16.398
Caption: the other thing we might want to do

02:56:13.839 --> 02:56:19.200
Caption: though is have like a sprint board right

02:56:16.399 --> 02:56:21.359
Caption: so let&#39;s create a new view

02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:22.879
Caption: and this view is going to be

02:56:21.359 --> 02:56:24.959
Caption: a board view

02:56:22.879 --> 02:56:27.040
Caption: and so now we have our

02:56:24.959 --> 02:56:28.639
Caption: board for all the ones with no status so

02:56:27.040 --> 02:56:31.679
Caption: by default it&#39;s kind of giving me the

02:56:28.639 --> 02:56:33.919
Caption: status so to do doing done none of these

02:56:31.679 --> 02:56:35.759
Caption: have a status so i obviously want some

02:56:33.919 --> 02:56:37.759
Caption: of them over here

02:56:35.759 --> 02:56:38.719
Caption: but actually this is my sprint board so

02:56:37.759 --> 02:56:41.358
Caption: i&#39;m going to

02:56:38.719 --> 02:56:44.080
Caption: filter by

02:56:41.359 --> 02:56:44.080
Caption: filter by

02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:46.959
Caption: sprint

02:56:47.040 --> 02:56:49.839
Caption: and then just say

02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:53.439
Caption: the current sprint

02:56:52.719 --> 02:56:54.719
Caption: so

02:56:53.439 --> 02:56:55.840
Caption: you can say yeah this is the current

02:56:54.719 --> 02:56:57.278
Caption: sprint or the previous sprint or the

02:56:55.839 --> 02:56:59.759
Caption: next sprint you can even say current

02:56:57.279 --> 02:57:01.200
Caption: plus two or previous minus one or

02:56:59.759 --> 02:57:03.200
Caption: something like that which is pretty

02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:04.719
Caption: handy um and then you can work with

02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:06.959
Caption: these these sprint boards as well you

02:57:04.719 --> 02:57:08.478
Caption: can change what&#39;s on the cards

02:57:06.959 --> 02:57:10.959
Caption: i mean this is a

02:57:08.478 --> 02:57:11.759
Caption: demo that i could spend hours and hours

02:57:10.959 --> 02:57:14.959
Caption: on

02:57:11.759 --> 02:57:16.879
Caption: if i could work the mouse

02:57:14.959 --> 02:57:19.200
Caption: one thing to note as well is that these

02:57:16.879 --> 02:57:21.438
Caption: projects are

02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:23.279
Caption: at the organization level

02:57:21.439 --> 02:57:24.720
Caption: so we understand that you might have

02:57:23.279 --> 02:57:25.919
Caption: issues across a number of different

02:57:24.719 --> 02:57:27.679
Caption: repos

02:57:25.919 --> 02:57:29.599
Caption: um for a project especially if you have

02:57:27.679 --> 02:57:31.438
Caption: a microservices situation where you have

02:57:29.599 --> 02:57:33.599
Caption: a different repo for your different

02:57:31.439 --> 02:57:35.120
Caption: services but you want this roll-up view

02:57:33.599 --> 02:57:36.398
Caption: of all of the things that are going on

02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:38.879
Caption: at the moment

02:57:36.399 --> 02:57:40.399
Caption: so at the org level you have a project

02:57:38.879 --> 02:57:41.919
Caption: and you pull in the issues that you care

02:57:40.399 --> 02:57:44.319
Caption: about for that project across the

02:57:41.919 --> 02:57:45.839
Caption: different repositories or maybe pull in

02:57:44.319 --> 02:57:47.520
Caption: the pull requests because you care about

02:57:45.839 --> 02:57:50.318
Caption: them as well so issues and pull requests

02:57:47.519 --> 02:57:50.318
Caption: can appear here

02:57:50.559 --> 02:57:54.639
Caption: you can also have the same issue in

02:57:52.559 --> 02:57:56.799
Caption: multiple projects and those projects can

02:57:54.639 --> 02:57:58.478
Caption: have different custom fields so here

02:57:56.799 --> 02:58:00.639
Caption: i&#39;ve got a bunch of work that&#39;s going on

02:57:58.478 --> 02:58:02.159
Caption: maybe my managers want a different view

02:58:00.639 --> 02:58:03.759
Caption: of all of the epics

02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:06.399
Caption: in my organization

02:58:03.759 --> 02:58:08.240
Caption: across multiple projects and they also

02:58:06.399 --> 02:58:10.160
Caption: have some fields they want to track like

02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:12.160
Caption: maybe they just want a current status of

02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:14.000
Caption: red green and um

02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:16.959
Caption: yellow or something like that

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:19.200
Caption: that extra field belongs to that project

02:58:16.959 --> 02:58:20.559
Caption: and the issue can set you know that

02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:22.640
Caption: value on the project so you can have

02:58:20.559 --> 02:58:23.919
Caption: different views of the same information

02:58:22.639 --> 02:58:25.599
Caption: the great thing about this though is you

02:58:23.919 --> 02:58:26.879
Caption: can absolutely customize this for

02:58:25.599 --> 02:58:28.398
Caption: however you want

02:58:26.879 --> 02:58:30.478
Caption: you don&#39;t need to

02:58:28.399 --> 02:58:32.160
Caption: you know you&#39;re not stuck in the way

02:58:30.478 --> 02:58:33.358
Caption: that github thinks you should run a

02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:35.439
Caption: project

02:58:33.359 --> 02:58:36.640
Caption: you can do it any way you want

02:58:35.439 --> 02:58:37.760
Caption: the one thing i didn&#39;t show you on this

02:58:36.639 --> 02:58:40.398
Caption: which i love

02:58:37.759 --> 02:58:43.599
Caption: is that you can also put in draft issues

02:58:40.399 --> 02:58:46.560
Caption: so i can add one here to say

02:58:43.599 --> 02:58:48.799
Caption: i don&#39;t know get a new laptop there&#39;s a

02:58:46.559 --> 02:58:50.879
Caption: theme for these issues by the way um and

02:58:48.799 --> 02:58:52.318
Caption: this is a draft issue because it doesn&#39;t

02:58:50.879 --> 02:58:54.639
Caption: belong to a repository yet it just

02:58:52.319 --> 02:58:56.720
Caption: belongs to this project

02:58:54.639 --> 02:58:58.879
Caption: we have teams

02:58:56.719 --> 02:59:01.200
Caption: in github who use basically nothing but

02:58:58.879 --> 02:59:02.959
Caption: draft issues they

02:59:01.200 --> 02:59:04.319
Caption: do everything as draft issues and it&#39;s

02:59:02.959 --> 02:59:06.080
Caption: only when they actually need to do the

02:59:04.319 --> 02:59:08.399
Caption: work that they will

02:59:06.080 --> 02:59:09.839
Caption: convert to an issue

02:59:08.399 --> 02:59:11.120
Caption: and then it will ask you what repository

02:59:09.839 --> 02:59:14.318
Caption: you want that issue in because it has to

02:59:11.120 --> 02:59:16.000
Caption: belong to a repository at that stage

02:59:14.319 --> 02:59:18.080
Caption: so look i could i could go on and on

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:20.240
Caption: about all of this sort of stuff um

02:59:18.080 --> 02:59:22.240
Caption: before i move on to kind of moving on

02:59:20.240 --> 02:59:25.680
Caption: from the planning any questions about

02:59:22.240 --> 02:59:28.640
Caption: stuff that i haven&#39;t shown you on here

02:59:25.679 --> 02:59:31.199
Caption: anyone want to give me a laptop

02:59:28.639 --> 02:59:34.000
Caption: and staying down okay

02:59:31.200 --> 02:59:35.600
Caption: so look this is also free for everybody

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:37.439
Caption: we don&#39;t charge anything for github

02:59:35.599 --> 02:59:39.679
Caption: projects so your own repositories you

02:59:37.439 --> 02:59:41.279
Caption: can do it um or your own organizations

02:59:39.679 --> 02:59:43.679
Caption: your own accounts you can have projects

02:59:41.279 --> 02:59:45.359
Caption: as well anything you anything you like

02:59:43.679 --> 02:59:46.559
Caption: there&#39;s no extra money for this there&#39;s

02:59:45.359 --> 02:59:50.000
Caption: some other features that i didn&#39;t show

02:59:46.559 --> 02:59:51.599
Caption: you as well to do with like workflows um

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:54.160
Caption: so when

02:59:51.599 --> 02:59:55.759
Caption: a an issue sorry when an issue gets

02:59:54.160 --> 02:59:57.359
Caption: dragged into the done column then market

02:59:55.759 --> 02:59:59.759
Caption: is closed in the repo and things like

02:59:57.359 --> 03:00:01.520
Caption: that i&#39;m sorry other way around

02:59:59.759 --> 03:00:03.599
Caption: a bunch of things like that there&#39;s more

03:00:01.519 --> 03:00:06.879
Caption: coming to workflows as well there&#39;s also

03:00:03.599 --> 03:00:09.278
Caption: insights that is i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s

03:00:06.879 --> 03:00:11.679
Caption: public preview yet i think it&#39;s in the

03:00:09.279 --> 03:00:14.399
Caption: public beta um insight so you can do

03:00:11.679 --> 03:00:16.160
Caption: your burn down charts or burn up

03:00:14.399 --> 03:00:19.760
Caption: cumulative flow diagrams or the

03:00:16.160 --> 03:00:19.759
Caption: management manager stuff as well

03:00:19.919 --> 03:00:22.559
Caption: somebody from github in the back is

03:00:21.359 --> 03:00:25.840
Caption: looking at me like i don&#39;t know if

03:00:22.559 --> 03:00:25.839
Caption: that&#39;s public

03:00:33.040 --> 03:00:37.040
Caption: yeah so org level for the oh yeah okay

03:00:35.599 --> 03:00:39.438
Caption: there we go so the burn up charts and

03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:41.679
Caption: stuff are at the

03:00:39.439 --> 03:00:44.240
Caption: enterprise right or all global burn up

03:00:41.679 --> 03:00:44.239
Caption: chats yeah

03:00:44.719 --> 03:00:48.000
Caption: cool

03:00:46.478 --> 03:00:49.599
Caption: awesome all right let&#39;s go back to this

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:51.359
Caption: code and we&#39;re gonna do some of this

03:00:49.599 --> 03:00:53.438
Caption: work all right so

03:00:51.359 --> 03:00:55.200
Caption: uh i don&#39;t know if anybody here had the

03:00:53.439 --> 03:00:56.720
Caption: same experience as me with my first dev

03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:58.399
Caption: job is it took

03:00:56.719 --> 03:01:00.080
Caption: literally about a month before i could

03:00:58.399 --> 03:01:02.399
Caption: actually write code on the code base

03:01:00.080 --> 03:01:04.000
Caption: because they had to find me a computer

03:01:02.399 --> 03:01:05.040
Caption: and then they had to set that computer

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.478
Caption: up with the standard operating

03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:08.000
Caption: environment and then the project i was

03:01:06.478 --> 03:01:09.679
Caption: on had these other dependencies that i

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:11.599
Caption: needed in there as well

03:01:09.679 --> 03:01:13.438
Caption: so you know time to actually writing the

03:01:11.599 --> 03:01:15.519
Caption: first code or making the first commit

03:01:13.439 --> 03:01:18.000
Caption: was long right

03:01:15.519 --> 03:01:19.759
Caption: which is a problem especially if you are

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:21.519
Caption: on multiple projects i don&#39;t know if

03:01:19.759 --> 03:01:23.679
Caption: anybody&#39;s skipped from one project to

03:01:21.519 --> 03:01:25.119
Caption: another and there&#39;s this period of

03:01:23.679 --> 03:01:26.318
Caption: how do i get all this stuff working

03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:28.639
Caption: they&#39;re using different versions of the

03:01:26.319 --> 03:01:30.640
Caption: dependencies all that kind of stuff

03:01:28.639 --> 03:01:32.478
Caption: it&#39;s also bad for

03:01:30.639 --> 03:01:34.959
Caption: open source and for contributing to

03:01:32.478 --> 03:01:36.318
Caption: other projects inner source is a problem

03:01:34.959 --> 03:01:38.000
Caption: as well so i know when i worked at

03:01:36.319 --> 03:01:39.600
Caption: microsoft

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:42.240
Caption: everyone at microsoft every engineer at

03:01:39.599 --> 03:01:44.639
Caption: microsoft has access to almost every

03:01:42.240 --> 03:01:46.799
Caption: repository every code base

03:01:44.639 --> 03:01:48.159
Caption: and you&#39;re encouraged if you find

03:01:46.799 --> 03:01:49.599
Caption: something that you need in somebody

03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:51.600
Caption: else&#39;s code base to submit a pull

03:01:49.599 --> 03:01:53.119
Caption: request like to to actually go and

03:01:51.599 --> 03:01:55.519
Caption: change it look at their code see how it

03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:57.200
Caption: works which is great except i can&#39;t

03:01:55.519 --> 03:01:58.959
Caption: debug that because they&#39;ve got this huge

03:01:57.200 --> 03:02:00.959
Caption: list of dependencies

03:01:58.959 --> 03:02:03.359
Caption: i can&#39;t get that working it&#39;s not worth

03:02:00.959 --> 03:02:06.639
Caption: my time so i just don&#39;t do it

03:02:03.359 --> 03:02:08.720
Caption: enter code spaces so code spaces is a

03:02:06.639 --> 03:02:11.278
Caption: dev environment in the cloud that&#39;s

03:02:08.719 --> 03:02:13.040
Caption: targeted at a specific repository so you

03:02:11.279 --> 03:02:15.439
Caption: basically have the definition of what&#39;s

03:02:13.040 --> 03:02:17.279
Caption: required to write code for a project

03:02:15.439 --> 03:02:19.600
Caption: defined alongside the code for that

03:02:17.279 --> 03:02:20.560
Caption: project

03:02:19.599 --> 03:02:22.159
Caption: before

03:02:20.559 --> 03:02:23.438
Caption: before code space as well if you just

03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:24.799
Caption: want to make a small change you don&#39;t

03:02:23.439 --> 03:02:26.319
Caption: need to do any debugging or anything

03:02:24.799 --> 03:02:28.160
Caption: like that just in case anybody hasn&#39;t

03:02:26.319 --> 03:02:30.560
Caption: seen this before

03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:33.040
Caption: this is in every repository if you hit

03:02:30.559 --> 03:02:34.719
Caption: the dot button presuming it&#39;s the same

03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:36.719
Caption: on a different laptop

03:02:34.719 --> 03:02:38.959
Caption: um the full stop button dot button

03:02:36.719 --> 03:02:41.200
Caption: period whatever you want to call it

03:02:38.959 --> 03:02:42.799
Caption: on any github repo even if it&#39;s not

03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:45.040
Caption: yours

03:02:42.799 --> 03:02:48.240
Caption: it&#39;ll open the web editor

03:02:45.040 --> 03:02:50.959
Caption: which is basically visual studio code

03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:52.479
Caption: running in your browser so there&#39;s no

03:02:50.959 --> 03:02:55.200
Caption: compute on the back end in this case

03:02:52.478 --> 03:02:57.438
Caption: it&#39;s just running inside your browser

03:02:55.200 --> 03:02:57.439
Caption: and

03:02:57.679 --> 03:03:02.160
Caption: you can make changes to the code you can

03:03:00.959 --> 03:03:03.839
Caption: not debug

03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:05.600
Caption: but you can submit

03:03:03.839 --> 03:03:07.759
Caption: a code change you could submit a pull

03:03:05.599 --> 03:03:08.719
Caption: request you can do all of that kind of

03:03:07.759 --> 03:03:10.398
Caption: stuff

03:03:08.719 --> 03:03:12.879
Caption: um

03:03:10.399 --> 03:03:14.800
Caption: yeah so you can make small changes

03:03:12.879 --> 03:03:16.478
Caption: i actually use this constantly like if i

03:03:14.799 --> 03:03:18.959
Caption: need to make a small change to a readme

03:03:16.478 --> 03:03:20.639
Caption: or something like that i&#39;ll just hit dot

03:03:18.959 --> 03:03:23.200
Caption: open it up in here

03:03:20.639 --> 03:03:24.879
Caption: um this is also really really good for

03:03:23.200 --> 03:03:26.879
Caption: code reviews so if somebody submits a

03:03:24.879 --> 03:03:29.040
Caption: pull request and you go to the pull

03:03:26.879 --> 03:03:31.200
Caption: request page and hit the dot you&#39;re

03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:33.599
Caption: brought to visual studio code to the web

03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:35.359
Caption: editor or web-based editor

03:03:33.599 --> 03:03:36.639
Caption: in the context of looking at that pool

03:03:35.359 --> 03:03:38.399
Caption: request

03:03:36.639 --> 03:03:40.478
Caption: so you can see the changes you can see

03:03:38.399 --> 03:03:42.319
Caption: what was committed

03:03:40.478 --> 03:03:45.119
Caption: the files that are different and you can

03:03:42.319 --> 03:03:46.319
Caption: leave comments and say this looks good

03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:48.240
Caption: if you have permissions you can even

03:03:46.319 --> 03:03:51.680
Caption: merge those pull requests

03:03:48.240 --> 03:03:53.359
Caption: in the context of a visual studio code

03:03:51.679 --> 03:03:54.639
Caption: instance so you can see the library you

03:03:53.359 --> 03:03:56.560
Caption: can see all the files you can see

03:03:54.639 --> 03:03:58.159
Caption: everything like that

03:03:56.559 --> 03:03:59.759
Caption: but like i said what you can&#39;t do here

03:03:58.160 --> 03:04:01.439
Caption: unfortunately

03:03:59.759 --> 03:04:03.919
Caption: is

03:04:01.439 --> 03:04:03.920
Caption: debug

03:04:04.080 --> 03:04:07.679
Caption: especially if you don&#39;t know the

03:04:05.599 --> 03:04:09.119
Caption: shortcut keys

03:04:07.679 --> 03:04:10.879
Caption: so there&#39;s no terminal because there&#39;s

03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:13.200
Caption: no compute in the background

03:04:10.879 --> 03:04:14.398
Caption: i can&#39;t do any run and debug stuff

03:04:13.200 --> 03:04:16.000
Caption: because there&#39;s no compute in the

03:04:14.399 --> 03:04:18.240
Caption: background

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:20.799
Caption: and obviously in the real world you need

03:04:18.240 --> 03:04:22.640
Caption: to do that stuff so code spaces is

03:04:20.799 --> 03:04:23.839
Caption: basically the same as this

03:04:22.639 --> 03:04:26.639
Caption: except

03:04:23.839 --> 03:04:28.639
Caption: it has compute it&#39;s a cloud-based dev

03:04:26.639 --> 03:04:30.239
Caption: environment

03:04:28.639 --> 03:04:32.000
Caption: now because we&#39;re short on time normally

03:04:30.240 --> 03:04:34.160
Caption: i&#39;d create a new one to show you how how

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:36.080
Caption: quickly this works but

03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:38.080
Caption: if you go to the code button here and

03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:38.959
Caption: then go to code spaces

03:04:38.080 --> 03:04:41.839
Caption: uh

03:04:38.959 --> 03:04:43.359
Caption: and i&#39;ve got one here which is not clean

03:04:41.839 --> 03:04:44.318
Caption: that&#39;s great

03:04:43.359 --> 03:04:46.640
Caption: oh you know what i&#39;m just going to

03:04:44.319 --> 03:04:48.840
Caption: create a new code space

03:04:46.639 --> 03:04:52.000
Caption: so you can see how fast it is

03:04:48.839 --> 03:04:53.519
Caption: um so what it is doing is spinning up a

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.639
Caption: container in the cloud that&#39;s running on

03:04:53.519 --> 03:04:56.000
Caption: a machine

03:04:54.639 --> 03:04:58.000
Caption: um that has

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:59.759
Caption: uh whatever resources i need to give it

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:01.919
Caption: there are a number of sizes for these

03:04:59.759 --> 03:05:04.000
Caption: code spaces as well so you can do

03:05:01.919 --> 03:05:07.359
Caption: you know two core machines up to i think

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:08.478
Caption: it&#39;s 32 core if you ask us nicely

03:05:07.359 --> 03:05:10.160
Caption: um

03:05:08.478 --> 03:05:11.679
Caption: i think by default you can do anything

03:05:10.160 --> 03:05:14.319
Caption: up to 32

03:05:11.679 --> 03:05:17.438
Caption: uh core machines i believe

03:05:14.319 --> 03:05:19.359
Caption: um and they get charged basically per

03:05:17.439 --> 03:05:20.720
Caption: minute like so they get charged based on

03:05:19.359 --> 03:05:21.680
Caption: usage

03:05:20.719 --> 03:05:23.200
Caption: um

03:05:21.679 --> 03:05:24.398
Caption: the good thing as well is if you leave

03:05:23.200 --> 03:05:26.080
Caption: them

03:05:24.399 --> 03:05:27.279
Caption: like you you log out and you don&#39;t do

03:05:26.080 --> 03:05:29.599
Caption: anything you don&#39;t stop them they&#39;ll

03:05:27.279 --> 03:05:31.760
Caption: stop themselves after a period of time i

03:05:29.599 --> 03:05:33.919
Caption: think by default it&#39;s 20 or 30 minutes

03:05:31.759 --> 03:05:36.398
Caption: it&#39;ll stop itself we did an internal

03:05:33.919 --> 03:05:39.200
Caption: survey because fun story github github

03:05:36.399 --> 03:05:42.080
Caption: so github.com which is a mono repo which

03:05:39.200 --> 03:05:46.479
Caption: is about 11 gig of code

03:05:42.080 --> 03:05:48.240
Caption: we do github.com entirely on code spaces

03:05:46.478 --> 03:05:49.759
Caption: so we use this internally for our own

03:05:48.240 --> 03:05:52.399
Caption: gigantic repo

03:05:49.759 --> 03:05:55.200
Caption: using some features like pre-builds so

03:05:52.399 --> 03:05:55.200
Caption: we can oh that&#39;s good

03:05:55.279 --> 03:06:01.600
Caption: so using some features like pre-builds

03:05:59.439 --> 03:06:03.840
Caption: we can get the speed of like starting a

03:06:01.599 --> 03:06:07.438
Caption: new code space up

03:06:03.839 --> 03:06:08.799
Caption: sorry down to really really small

03:06:07.439 --> 03:06:09.760
Caption: small numbers

03:06:08.799 --> 03:06:12.398
Caption: so

03:06:09.759 --> 03:06:13.759
Caption: if this works um i&#39;ll show you that in a

03:06:12.399 --> 03:06:16.640
Caption: sec but

03:06:13.759 --> 03:06:20.240
Caption: for github.com 11 gig code base about 23

03:06:16.639 --> 03:06:21.759
Caption: gig on disk if you do a deep um clone

03:06:20.240 --> 03:06:24.080
Caption: takes about

03:06:21.759 --> 03:06:26.879
Caption: i think it&#39;s about 10 seconds 10 12

03:06:24.080 --> 03:06:29.359
Caption: seconds to go from clicking the button

03:06:26.879 --> 03:06:30.879
Caption: to being able to debug the code with

03:06:29.359 --> 03:06:32.000
Caption: multiple containers running different

03:06:30.879 --> 03:06:34.398
Caption: services

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:36.000
Caption: in a debugging environment

03:06:34.399 --> 03:06:37.040
Caption: and you can commit code and do that work

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:39.279
Caption: straight away

03:06:37.040 --> 03:06:41.040
Caption: it&#39;s super powerful and it also means if

03:06:39.279 --> 03:06:42.479
Caption: somebody new joins the team they just

03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:44.160
Caption: create a new code space and they can

03:06:42.478 --> 03:06:45.438
Caption: write code immediately

03:06:44.160 --> 03:06:46.560
Caption: if you start working on a different

03:06:45.439 --> 03:06:49.040
Caption: project

03:06:46.559 --> 03:06:51.438
Caption: and they have code spaces set up there

03:06:49.040 --> 03:06:52.879
Caption: you can go to that other project starter

03:06:51.439 --> 03:06:54.319
Caption: code space and now you have this brand

03:06:52.879 --> 03:06:57.438
Caption: new dev machine that&#39;s targeted

03:06:54.319 --> 03:06:59.200
Caption: specifically at um at that repository

03:06:57.439 --> 03:07:00.479
Caption: and at that code base

03:06:59.200 --> 03:07:03.279
Caption: so here we go

03:07:00.478 --> 03:07:03.278
Caption: we are in

03:07:03.679 --> 03:07:09.679
Caption: and this is my little application

03:07:06.080 --> 03:07:11.040
Caption: uh let&#39;s see if i can run it in debug

03:07:09.679 --> 03:07:13.278
Caption: it&#39;s a node app

03:07:11.040 --> 03:07:15.679
Caption: so i&#39;ll choose node

03:07:13.279 --> 03:07:17.040
Caption: and remember this is all running just um

03:07:15.679 --> 03:07:18.879
Caption: through my browser i don&#39;t have this

03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:19.919
Caption: code base on this machine on this laptop

03:07:18.879 --> 03:07:21.839
Caption: at all

03:07:19.919 --> 03:07:23.679
Caption: not just

03:07:21.839 --> 03:07:25.599
Caption: not just for the obvious reasons that

03:07:23.679 --> 03:07:27.199
Caption: it&#39;s not my laptop

03:07:25.599 --> 03:07:28.398
Caption: this actually makes the demo kind of

03:07:27.200 --> 03:07:29.439
Caption: cool right

03:07:28.399 --> 03:07:30.880
Caption: um

03:07:29.439 --> 03:07:32.399
Caption: you know i don&#39;t have the code on here

03:07:30.879 --> 03:07:34.799
Caption: because it&#39;s not my machine

03:07:32.399 --> 03:07:36.959
Caption: um but i&#39;m still able to

03:07:34.799 --> 03:07:38.559
Caption: you know do the work to write the code

03:07:36.959 --> 03:07:39.839
Caption: so this is what the application looks

03:07:38.559 --> 03:07:42.159
Caption: like

03:07:39.839 --> 03:07:43.279
Caption: if i go back into my codespace again in

03:07:42.160 --> 03:07:45.120
Caption: the browser

03:07:43.279 --> 03:07:48.000
Caption: and i find

03:07:45.120 --> 03:07:50.639
Caption: a file let&#39;s find

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:53.040
Caption: index.js

03:07:50.639 --> 03:07:56.159
Caption: get rid of that and then i&#39;ll put a

03:07:53.040 --> 03:07:56.160
Caption: break point on that render

03:07:56.399 --> 03:08:00.399
Caption: and refresh

03:07:58.478 --> 03:08:01.839
Caption: and in my other browser tab i&#39;ve hit

03:08:00.399 --> 03:08:03.760
Caption: this breakpoint and you get all of the

03:08:01.839 --> 03:08:07.040
Caption: nice stuff that you would normally get

03:08:03.759 --> 03:08:08.799
Caption: debugging in a vs code instance

03:08:07.040 --> 03:08:10.080
Caption: on somebody else&#39;s computer or on a

03:08:08.799 --> 03:08:12.639
Caption: raspberry pi

03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:14.799
Caption: wherever you are right

03:08:12.639 --> 03:08:16.478
Caption: so pretty cool pretty cool stuff

03:08:14.799 --> 03:08:18.398
Caption: i was going to do a tiny little co-pilot

03:08:16.478 --> 03:08:20.398
Caption: demo but instead you should go and go to

03:08:18.399 --> 03:08:22.560
Caption: misha&#39;s talk

03:08:20.399 --> 03:08:25.520
Caption: at 3 15 i think where she&#39;s gonna do

03:08:22.559 --> 03:08:27.278
Caption: co-pilot entirely um but i was going to

03:08:25.519 --> 03:08:29.119
Caption: like randomize those haikus but i don&#39;t

03:08:27.279 --> 03:08:30.479
Caption: remember how to do it so i would do

03:08:29.120 --> 03:08:32.160
Caption: something like

03:08:30.478 --> 03:08:34.318
Caption: yeah i&#39;d need to install co-pilots i&#39;m

03:08:32.160 --> 03:08:35.679
Caption: not going to do it um just ask co-pilot

03:08:34.319 --> 03:08:37.919
Caption: to tell me how to randomize in node

03:08:35.679 --> 03:08:40.239
Caption: because i don&#39;t know

03:08:37.919 --> 03:08:41.200
Caption: right so that&#39;s code spaces it&#39;s super

03:08:40.240 --> 03:08:42.720
Caption: powerful

03:08:41.200 --> 03:08:44.399
Caption: you can also connect remotely from a

03:08:42.719 --> 03:08:46.879
Caption: visual studio code instance on your

03:08:44.399 --> 03:08:50.479
Caption: local machine if you want to

03:08:46.879 --> 03:08:52.398
Caption: you can stop them start them disconnect

03:08:50.478 --> 03:08:54.079
Caption: and have multiple running at the same

03:08:52.399 --> 03:08:56.160
Caption: time

03:08:54.080 --> 03:08:58.319
Caption: so if you are doing some work for one

03:08:56.160 --> 03:09:00.000
Caption: particular a branch of your code you can

03:08:58.319 --> 03:09:02.160
Caption: have a code space open for that and

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:03.359
Caption: another one for the main one and so on

03:09:02.160 --> 03:09:05.919
Caption: um

03:09:03.359 --> 03:09:07.919
Caption: and as i said they&#39;ll stop themselves

03:09:05.919 --> 03:09:10.080
Caption: if you&#39;re not using them we did a little

03:09:07.919 --> 03:09:13.519
Caption: survey internally for github github to

03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:15.120
Caption: find out how often people

03:09:13.519 --> 03:09:16.959
Caption: how often people actually stopped the

03:09:15.120 --> 03:09:18.000
Caption: code spaces themselves or how often they

03:09:16.959 --> 03:09:19.359
Caption: just like

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:20.799
Caption: turned their computer off and waited for

03:09:19.359 --> 03:09:23.840
Caption: it to stop itself

03:09:20.799 --> 03:09:25.200
Caption: and it was uh approximately there might

03:09:23.839 --> 03:09:26.879
Caption: be a little bit of counting error

03:09:25.200 --> 03:09:28.479
Caption: approximately a hundred percent of

03:09:26.879 --> 03:09:31.279
Caption: people didn&#39;t turn it off they just let

03:09:28.478 --> 03:09:32.239
Caption: it expire so

03:09:31.279 --> 03:09:34.479
Caption: yeah

03:09:32.240 --> 03:09:35.919
Caption: uh yeah so one yeah that&#39;s a very good

03:09:34.478 --> 03:09:36.879
Caption: point i overheard there which is that&#39;s

03:09:35.919 --> 03:09:39.200
Caption: because they work at github and they

03:09:36.879 --> 03:09:40.879
Caption: don&#39;t pay for these which is true

03:09:39.200 --> 03:09:42.240
Caption: um i did a little back of the envelope

03:09:40.879 --> 03:09:45.599
Caption: calculation and if you&#39;re running i

03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:47.200
Caption: think it&#39;s a 16 core machine or

03:09:45.599 --> 03:09:49.199
Caption: something like that and you&#39;re working 8

03:09:47.200 --> 03:09:51.439
Caption: hours a day

03:09:49.200 --> 03:09:52.879
Caption: 50 weeks a year or 48 weeks a year or

03:09:51.439 --> 03:09:54.479
Caption: something like that it&#39;s about

03:09:52.879 --> 03:09:56.639
Caption: equivalent to

03:09:54.478 --> 03:09:58.478
Caption: buying a new laptop every two years or

03:09:56.639 --> 03:10:00.959
Caption: something like that but remember you&#39;ve

03:09:58.478 --> 03:10:02.478
Caption: got these code spaces that you can have

03:10:00.959 --> 03:10:04.559
Caption: in all of these different environments

03:10:02.478 --> 03:10:06.398
Caption: and they just don&#39;t charge you for usage

03:10:04.559 --> 03:10:07.919
Caption: when they&#39;re shut down so you could have

03:10:06.399 --> 03:10:09.840
Caption: 30 projects that you&#39;re working on with

03:10:07.919 --> 03:10:11.839
Caption: 30 different code spaces that you can

03:10:09.839 --> 03:10:13.839
Caption: start working on immediately

03:10:11.839 --> 03:10:15.200
Caption: from any laptop you have it doesn&#39;t need

03:10:13.839 --> 03:10:16.559
Caption: to be new

03:10:15.200 --> 03:10:19.520
Caption: you should definitely have the newest

03:10:16.559 --> 03:10:21.199
Caption: best laptop though that&#39;s a good idea

03:10:19.519 --> 03:10:23.278
Caption: yeah

03:10:21.200 --> 03:10:25.200
Caption: so

03:10:23.279 --> 03:10:26.720
Caption: i&#39;m running low on time as well so we&#39;re

03:10:25.200 --> 03:10:28.640
Caption: going to move very quickly to the next

03:10:26.719 --> 03:10:30.398
Caption: bit so that&#39;s kind of our inner loop

03:10:28.639 --> 03:10:32.159
Caption: that&#39;s a dev environment that means that

03:10:30.399 --> 03:10:34.319
Caption: i can write my code really quickly i can

03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:36.000
Caption: get started on new projects

03:10:34.319 --> 03:10:37.520
Caption: and i don&#39;t have to worry so much about

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:39.439
Caption: the hardware or the dependencies running

03:10:37.519 --> 03:10:40.959
Caption: on my local machine super powerful but

03:10:39.439 --> 03:10:43.040
Caption: then when i have made the change how do

03:10:40.959 --> 03:10:44.478
Caption: i get that into production and this is

03:10:43.040 --> 03:10:45.839
Caption: one of the probably better known

03:10:44.478 --> 03:10:49.278
Caption: features i guess of github which is

03:10:45.839 --> 03:10:51.599
Caption: github actions who uses github actions

03:10:49.279 --> 03:10:53.279
Caption: okay probably about half the room who&#39;s

03:10:51.599 --> 03:10:56.959
Caption: heard of github actions like who&#39;s aware

03:10:53.279 --> 03:10:56.959
Caption: of it the same people

03:10:57.839 --> 03:11:00.478
Caption: well now the rest of you have heard

03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:02.479
Caption: about it so you can move into the next

03:11:00.478 --> 03:11:03.839
Caption: column of using it

03:11:02.478 --> 03:11:04.959
Caption: rather than actually run one of these

03:11:03.839 --> 03:11:06.080
Caption: i&#39;m going to show you one i&#39;ve run

03:11:04.959 --> 03:11:07.200
Caption: before

03:11:06.080 --> 03:11:08.719
Caption: so

03:11:07.200 --> 03:11:10.160
Caption: the great thing about github actions is

03:11:08.719 --> 03:11:11.759
Caption: the definition of how to build your

03:11:10.160 --> 03:11:14.719
Caption: application and how to deploy your

03:11:11.759 --> 03:11:16.799
Caption: application is defined in a yaml file

03:11:14.719 --> 03:11:18.559
Caption: that sits alongside your code

03:11:16.799 --> 03:11:20.559
Caption: so when somebody clones or forks your

03:11:18.559 --> 03:11:22.719
Caption: repository they know not just what the

03:11:20.559 --> 03:11:24.239
Caption: code looks like but what the build

03:11:22.719 --> 03:11:26.639
Caption: situation is and what the deployment

03:11:24.240 --> 03:11:29.359
Caption: situation is they can see all of that

03:11:26.639 --> 03:11:31.358
Caption: if you&#39;ve got a specific code space

03:11:29.359 --> 03:11:33.840
Caption: definition set up so you can customize

03:11:31.359 --> 03:11:35.760
Caption: those code spaces in huge ways they also

03:11:33.839 --> 03:11:37.438
Caption: know what the dev machine needs to look

03:11:35.759 --> 03:11:39.200
Caption: like as well

03:11:37.439 --> 03:11:41.120
Caption: whether you&#39;re using code spaces or dev

03:11:39.200 --> 03:11:42.879
Caption: containers just locally

03:11:41.120 --> 03:11:44.560
Caption: you know what it you know everything

03:11:42.879 --> 03:11:45.839
Caption: about that project you have the code you

03:11:44.559 --> 03:11:48.159
Caption: have the definition of how you&#39;re going

03:11:45.839 --> 03:11:50.000
Caption: to like write code against it like what

03:11:48.160 --> 03:11:51.439
Caption: dependencies you need and then you have

03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:53.040
Caption: the definition of how you build it and

03:11:51.439 --> 03:11:56.319
Caption: how you deploy it and it&#39;s just all

03:11:53.040 --> 03:11:56.319
Caption: there in your repository

03:11:56.719 --> 03:12:00.318
Caption: this is kind of a more mature looking

03:11:58.639 --> 03:12:02.159
Caption: pipeline we&#39;ve got three stages here i&#39;m

03:12:00.319 --> 03:12:05.200
Caption: going to try and zoom in a bit

03:12:02.160 --> 03:12:07.600
Caption: uh i don&#39;t think this zooms great here

03:12:05.200 --> 03:12:09.919
Caption: there we go we&#39;ve got three stages here

03:12:07.599 --> 03:12:11.199
Caption: we&#39;ve got a build stage which does my

03:12:09.919 --> 03:12:13.200
Caption: compilation

03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:14.959
Caption: and we have a deployment stage which

03:12:13.200 --> 03:12:16.959
Caption: just deploys to

03:12:14.959 --> 03:12:18.879
Caption: azure in this case and then we have a

03:12:16.959 --> 03:12:20.639
Caption: production stage now the thing that i&#39;ve

03:12:18.879 --> 03:12:22.319
Caption: set up with production is it knows the

03:12:20.639 --> 03:12:24.080
Caption: production environment needs approvals

03:12:22.319 --> 03:12:25.840
Caption: before it goes to production

03:12:24.080 --> 03:12:28.000
Caption: so by saying in that definition i&#39;m

03:12:25.839 --> 03:12:30.240
Caption: deploying to production you get this

03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:31.599
Caption: protection where it has to pass a bunch

03:12:30.240 --> 03:12:34.720
Caption: of rules before it&#39;s allowed to go into

03:12:31.599 --> 03:12:36.398
Caption: production in this case that rule is i

03:12:34.719 --> 03:12:37.839
Caption: need to approve that before it goes into

03:12:36.399 --> 03:12:40.000
Caption: production

03:12:37.839 --> 03:12:42.160
Caption: you can put other rules in there like

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:45.200
Caption: you can only deploy to this environment

03:12:42.160 --> 03:12:47.040
Caption: from these branches of your repository

03:12:45.200 --> 03:12:49.040
Caption: so maybe you&#39;re doing a branching

03:12:47.040 --> 03:12:51.120
Caption: strategy where it&#39;s a trunk based

03:12:49.040 --> 03:12:53.040
Caption: development and people do feature

03:12:51.120 --> 03:12:54.560
Caption: branches but then they merge back into

03:12:53.040 --> 03:12:56.319
Caption: your main branch before it goes out to

03:12:54.559 --> 03:12:57.759
Caption: production you want to make sure nobody

03:12:56.319 --> 03:12:59.439
Caption: deploys to production from a feature

03:12:57.759 --> 03:13:01.278
Caption: branch right so you can put that

03:12:59.439 --> 03:13:02.399
Caption: protection on it as well and nobody can

03:13:01.279 --> 03:13:04.160
Caption: actually approve that to go to

03:13:02.399 --> 03:13:06.240
Caption: production

03:13:04.160 --> 03:13:09.120
Caption: so this went to the staging site it went

03:13:06.240 --> 03:13:11.600
Caption: to the production site we&#39;ve got a track

03:13:09.120 --> 03:13:13.520
Caption: of the deployments like the reviews

03:13:11.599 --> 03:13:14.879
Caption: sorry who did a review

03:13:13.519 --> 03:13:16.559
Caption: and then we&#39;ve even got the artifacts

03:13:14.879 --> 03:13:18.559
Caption: that were produced as well so part of

03:13:16.559 --> 03:13:20.559
Caption: the build was packaging everything up

03:13:18.559 --> 03:13:22.079
Caption: and then uploading it so the subsequent

03:13:20.559 --> 03:13:22.879
Caption: jobs could pull that down and do the

03:13:22.080 --> 03:13:24.799
Caption: work

03:13:22.879 --> 03:13:26.959
Caption: i actually deployed them as well

03:13:24.799 --> 03:13:29.278
Caption: the way these actually physically run

03:13:26.959 --> 03:13:31.359
Caption: is on these ones are on github hosted

03:13:29.279 --> 03:13:34.640
Caption: runners so these are

03:13:31.359 --> 03:13:36.479
Caption: agents that basically spin up when you

03:13:34.639 --> 03:13:38.159
Caption: when there&#39;s a job to do

03:13:36.478 --> 03:13:39.519
Caption: it&#39;ll download the code or do whatever

03:13:38.160 --> 03:13:41.439
Caption: you want it to do

03:13:39.519 --> 03:13:43.438
Caption: and then when it&#39;s finished it&#39;ll tear

03:13:41.439 --> 03:13:45.600
Caption: itself down entirely so they&#39;re on

03:13:43.439 --> 03:13:47.359
Caption: demand kind of hosted runners you can

03:13:45.599 --> 03:13:49.358
Caption: also self-host runners

03:13:47.359 --> 03:13:52.319
Caption: if you want you can run the running the

03:13:49.359 --> 03:13:54.399
Caption: runner executable on pretty much any

03:13:52.319 --> 03:13:56.319
Caption: machine i&#39;ve run them on raspberry pi&#39;s

03:13:54.399 --> 03:13:58.000
Caption: too so you can actually build your

03:13:56.319 --> 03:14:00.879
Caption: application on a raspberry pi if you

03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:02.879
Caption: really want to don&#39;t do that um or you

03:14:00.879 --> 03:14:05.279
Caption: can do the github hosted ones really new

03:14:02.879 --> 03:14:07.438
Caption: to github hosted runners as well is the

03:14:05.279 --> 03:14:09.279
Caption: larger sizes of github hosted runners so

03:14:07.439 --> 03:14:11.040
Caption: for for a very long time you didn&#39;t get

03:14:09.279 --> 03:14:13.040
Caption: to choose how big those runners were the

03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:15.120
Caption: only way to choose

03:14:13.040 --> 03:14:18.239
Caption: how much ram and all that kind of stuff

03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:20.239
Caption: was to do your self-hosted ones now for

03:14:18.239 --> 03:14:22.799
Caption: github team i believe and github

03:14:20.239 --> 03:14:24.479
Caption: enterprise cloud you can

03:14:22.799 --> 03:14:26.799
Caption: set up uh

03:14:24.478 --> 03:14:28.079
Caption: larger hosted runners to say i want you

03:14:26.799 --> 03:14:31.599
Caption: know one with

03:14:28.080 --> 03:14:32.479
Caption: 32 cores and gpus and all sorts of stuff

03:14:31.599 --> 03:14:33.358
Caption: so

03:14:32.478 --> 03:14:35.039
Caption: uh

03:14:33.359 --> 03:14:37.040
Caption: yeah long running builds or ones that

03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:38.719
Caption: are a bit slow you can do use hosted

03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:39.759
Caption: runners for those

03:14:38.719 --> 03:14:41.358
Caption: now

03:14:39.759 --> 03:14:44.799
Caption: there is a lot that i didn&#39;t cover in

03:14:41.359 --> 03:14:46.239
Caption: this for several reasons um

03:14:44.799 --> 03:14:47.438
Caption: if you want to see any of this stuff in

03:14:46.239 --> 03:14:48.479
Caption: a little bit more

03:14:47.439 --> 03:14:50.000
Caption: detail

03:14:48.478 --> 03:14:51.119
Caption: we&#39;ve got demos at the booth we&#39;ve got

03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:53.839
Caption: an awesome demo that was actually

03:14:51.120 --> 03:14:55.439
Caption: written by aaron powell who is probably

03:14:53.839 --> 03:14:56.239
Caption: in that room

03:14:55.439 --> 03:14:58.000
Caption: which

03:14:56.239 --> 03:15:00.080
Caption: has a code space with multiple

03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:02.559

04:52:24.240 --> 04:52:27.679
Caption: needs to be secure we can&#39;t have our app

04:52:25.919 --> 04:52:28.957
Caption: compromised by breaches not a problem

04:52:27.679 --> 04:52:30.560
Caption: and it needs to scale if we get hit with

04:52:28.957 --> 04:52:32.318
Caption: a ton of traffic and if it stalls or

04:52:30.560 --> 04:52:35.320
Caption: freezes up i will get fired we can do

04:52:32.320 --> 04:52:35.320

Caption: big data

04:55:17.759 --> 04:55:21.199
Caption: before we begin i&#39;d like to acknowledge

04:55:19.599 --> 04:55:22.796

04:55:33.599 --> 04:55:36.160
Caption: now

04:55:34.638 --> 04:55:38.958
Caption: today i&#39;m going to take you through the

04:55:36.160 --> 04:55:40.878
Caption: death of big data and then dive into the

04:55:38.957 --> 04:55:44.398
Caption: technology that has pushed it out of the

04:55:40.878 --> 04:55:45.681
Caption: spotlight spoiler alert it&#39;s data lakes

04:55:44.400 --> 04:55:47.519
Caption: then we&#39;re going to dive into what data

04:55:45.679 --> 04:55:49.199
Caption: lakes actually do

04:55:47.519 --> 04:55:53.279
Caption: and following that i&#39;ll explain a few

04:55:49.199 --> 04:55:55.599
Caption: other water analogies in the data area

04:55:53.279 --> 04:55:58.080
Caption: so my name is aiden as you&#39;ve just been

04:55:55.599 --> 04:55:59.919
Caption: told and i&#39;m a senior developer with kz

04:55:58.080 --> 04:56:01.919
Caption: kzn is a cloud consultancy that

04:55:59.919 --> 04:56:04.718
Caption: specializes in serverless technology and

04:56:01.919 --> 04:56:08.638
Caption: data engineering we have and continue to

04:56:04.718 --> 04:56:09.601
Caption: build data lakes for a range of clients

04:56:08.638 --> 04:56:11.839
Caption: and

04:56:09.599 --> 04:56:13.039
Caption: let&#39;s get started

04:56:11.839 --> 04:56:15.119
Caption: so

04:56:13.039 --> 04:56:16.796
Caption: to kick off this story of how big data

04:56:15.119 --> 04:56:18.716
Caption: went from buzzword number one to a thing

04:56:16.798 --> 04:56:22.080
Caption: of the past i&#39;m going to rewind to the

04:56:18.718 --> 04:56:23.761
Caption: beginning of time that was the mid 1980s

04:56:22.080 --> 04:56:25.759
Caption: in a simpler time

04:56:23.759 --> 04:56:28.876
Caption: we had data

04:56:25.759 --> 04:56:31.439
Caption: data was stored in data warehouses

04:56:28.878 --> 04:56:33.681
Caption: we used sql to extract value from that

04:56:31.439 --> 04:56:35.039
Caption: data in the form of reporting

04:56:33.679 --> 04:56:37.439
Caption: and that was it

04:56:35.039 --> 04:56:39.759
Caption: very simple

04:56:37.439 --> 04:56:40.558
Caption: they like it so

04:56:39.759 --> 04:56:43.599
Caption: now

04:56:40.560 --> 04:56:45.839
Caption: as we move forward to roughly 2011 we

04:56:43.599 --> 04:56:48.480
Caption: get into the age of big data let&#39;s

04:56:45.839 --> 04:56:50.560
Caption: define big data before we move forward

04:56:48.480 --> 04:56:52.718
Caption: big data refers to data sets that are

04:56:50.560 --> 04:56:54.958
Caption: too large or complex to deal with using

04:56:52.718 --> 04:56:57.681
Caption: traditional methods traditional methods

04:56:54.957 --> 04:56:59.679
Caption: largely being data warehouses

04:56:57.679 --> 04:57:01.599
Caption: now what caused the rise of big data

04:56:59.679 --> 04:57:03.199
Caption: lots of things but a major one with

04:57:01.599 --> 04:57:04.636
Caption: social media companies realizing how

04:57:03.199 --> 04:57:06.558
Caption: much money they can make from pushing us

04:57:04.638 --> 04:57:08.000
Caption: personalized ads

04:57:06.560 --> 04:57:10.160
Caption: other areas of technology started to

04:57:08.000 --> 04:57:12.080
Caption: pick up like iot

04:57:10.160 --> 04:57:14.000
Caption: if you look at things like cars 20 years

04:57:12.080 --> 04:57:16.240
Caption: ago they were purely mechanical devices

04:57:14.000 --> 04:57:18.957
Caption: if you&#39;re lucky they had electric

04:57:16.240 --> 04:57:20.718
Caption: windows but now we have companies like

04:57:18.957 --> 04:57:24.078
Caption: tesla or waymo where your cars are

04:57:20.718 --> 04:57:26.878
Caption: streaming vast volumes of data up

04:57:24.080 --> 04:57:26.878
Caption: to lose my sound

04:57:26.957 --> 04:57:30.716
Caption: okay we&#39;re streaming vast volumes of

04:57:28.798 --> 04:57:32.798
Caption: data up into the cloud from almost every

04:57:30.718 --> 04:57:35.601
Caption: appliance across the globe

04:57:32.798 --> 04:57:37.761
Caption: to give some idea of scale in 2010

04:57:35.599 --> 04:57:39.839
Caption: roughly 1.2 trillion gigabytes of data

04:57:37.759 --> 04:57:42.320
Caption: was generated by the human race

04:57:39.839 --> 04:57:43.519
Caption: in 2021 that number was 18 trillion

04:57:42.320 --> 04:57:45.519
Caption: gigabytes

04:57:43.519 --> 04:57:47.839
Caption: we are on an exponential exponential

04:57:45.519 --> 04:57:49.679
Caption: curve of data growth and the scale of

04:57:47.839 --> 04:57:51.679
Caption: our data sets is more important now than

04:57:49.679 --> 04:57:52.957
Caption: it ever has been

04:57:51.679 --> 04:57:54.160
Caption: the problem

04:57:52.957 --> 04:57:55.759
Caption: there was a few

04:57:54.160 --> 04:57:57.679
Caption: including structure which we&#39;ll talk

04:57:55.759 --> 04:58:00.080
Caption: about later but the key point i&#39;m going

04:57:57.679 --> 04:58:02.320
Caption: to focus on here is the pure volume

04:58:00.080 --> 04:58:04.638
Caption: traditional methods like data warehouses

04:58:02.320 --> 04:58:06.798
Caption: just could not scale or ingest data fast

04:58:04.638 --> 04:58:07.919
Caption: enough to keep up with the demand

04:58:06.798 --> 04:58:09.041
Caption: and hence

04:58:07.919 --> 04:58:11.199
Caption: big data

04:58:09.039 --> 04:58:14.957
Caption: volumes of information too large to be

04:58:11.199 --> 04:58:16.796
Caption: dealt with using traditional methods

04:58:14.957 --> 04:58:18.478
Caption: so what happened to this huge problem

04:58:16.798 --> 04:58:20.000
Caption: that we saw on every news channel and

04:58:18.480 --> 04:58:22.080
Caption: every magazine cover

04:58:20.000 --> 04:58:23.919
Caption: to give you an anticlimactic answer

04:58:22.080 --> 04:58:25.839
Caption: the problem got solved

04:58:23.919 --> 04:58:28.000
Caption: daleks provide a cheap and readily

04:58:25.839 --> 04:58:30.560
Caption: available means of storing and ingesting

04:58:28.000 --> 04:58:31.759
Caption: almost unlimited quantities of data

04:58:30.560 --> 04:58:33.919
Caption: that&#39;s it

04:58:31.759 --> 04:58:37.759
Caption: data engineers can sleep at night and

04:58:33.919 --> 04:58:40.080
Caption: everyone lived happily ever after

04:58:37.759 --> 04:58:41.759
Caption: except it wasn&#39;t quite that simple

04:58:40.080 --> 04:58:44.320
Caption: datalake solved a lot of the problems of

04:58:41.759 --> 04:58:45.839
Caption: big data a bit in a classic tech fashion

04:58:44.320 --> 04:58:47.201
Caption: replace those problems with newer

04:58:45.839 --> 04:58:49.039
Caption: challenges

04:58:47.199 --> 04:58:50.796
Caption: but before we dig into that i&#39;m hoping

04:58:49.039 --> 04:58:52.000
Caption: at this stage you have one very simple

04:58:50.798 --> 04:58:52.798
Caption: question bouncing around inside your

04:58:52.000 --> 04:58:55.199
Caption: head

04:58:52.798 --> 04:58:56.560
Caption: what is a data lake and how did it solve

04:58:55.199 --> 04:58:58.160
Caption: these problems

04:58:56.560 --> 04:59:00.400
Caption: i&#39;m glad you asked because someone had

04:58:58.160 --> 04:59:01.359
Caption: to to start understanding data lakes

04:59:00.400 --> 04:59:04.878
Caption: we&#39;re going to need to look at data

04:59:01.359 --> 04:59:06.716
Caption: warehouses that we talked about earlier

04:59:04.878 --> 04:59:08.320
Caption: now data warehouses were the core of

04:59:06.718 --> 04:59:09.441
Caption: business intelligence for the last 30

04:59:08.320 --> 04:59:11.519
Caption: something years

04:59:09.439 --> 04:59:13.679
Caption: for those that are new a data warehouse

04:59:11.519 --> 04:59:16.160
Caption: is a data management system designed to

04:59:13.679 --> 04:59:18.796
Caption: enable business intelligence activities

04:59:16.160 --> 04:59:20.878
Caption: that basically means we have data

04:59:18.798 --> 04:59:22.560
Caption: and we want to get value out of it

04:59:20.878 --> 04:59:24.560
Caption: we can break this down a little bit by

04:59:22.560 --> 04:59:27.041
Caption: looking at our key components we have a

04:59:24.560 --> 04:59:29.361
Caption: data warehouse which has a database or a

04:59:27.039 --> 04:59:31.759
Caption: variety of databases within it we have

04:59:29.359 --> 04:59:33.759
Caption: etls that&#39;s the extraction

04:59:31.759 --> 04:59:35.679
Caption: transformation and loading of data

04:59:33.759 --> 04:59:37.439
Caption: between different sources

04:59:35.679 --> 04:59:39.119
Caption: and then the system is set up in a way

04:59:37.439 --> 04:59:41.599
Caption: that allows integrations with external

04:59:39.119 --> 04:59:44.957
Caption: services whether it&#39;s an erp system like

04:59:41.599 --> 04:59:47.039
Caption: sap or oracle or a crm like salesforce

04:59:44.957 --> 04:59:48.796
Caption: through to analytics like power bi or

04:59:47.039 --> 04:59:50.158
Caption: tableau

04:59:48.798 --> 04:59:52.320
Caption: now the important thing to understand

04:59:50.160 --> 04:59:53.359
Caption: about data warehouses is that they store

04:59:52.320 --> 04:59:54.718
Caption: data

04:59:53.359 --> 04:59:57.119
Caption: in databases

04:59:54.718 --> 04:59:58.080
Caption: and databases only accept structured

04:59:57.119 --> 05:00:00.158
Caption: data

04:59:58.080 --> 05:00:01.919
Caption: hence a data warehouse can only store

05:00:00.160 --> 05:00:04.638
Caption: structured data

05:00:01.919 --> 05:00:06.320
Caption: but what is structured data

05:00:04.638 --> 05:00:08.400
Caption: now data can be structured or

05:00:06.320 --> 05:00:10.160
Caption: unstructured and this is one of the keys

05:00:08.400 --> 05:00:12.798
Caption: to understanding data lakes and the role

05:00:10.160 --> 05:00:14.400
Caption: they play in superseding data warehouses

05:00:12.798 --> 05:00:16.000
Caption: in the race to accommodate fast

05:00:14.400 --> 05:00:17.281
Caption: quantities of data

05:00:16.000 --> 05:00:19.679
Caption: let&#39;s start by looking at one of the

05:00:17.279 --> 05:00:21.519
Caption: most common types of unstructured data

05:00:19.679 --> 05:00:24.000
Caption: a csv

05:00:21.519 --> 05:00:26.080
Caption: now maybe the csv came from a script

05:00:24.000 --> 05:00:28.560
Caption: reading an api maybe it was an export

05:00:26.080 --> 05:00:29.919
Caption: from some third-party system

05:00:28.560 --> 05:00:31.441
Caption: as you can see

05:00:29.919 --> 05:00:33.039
Caption: we have data

05:00:31.439 --> 05:00:35.199
Caption: but we know very little information

05:00:33.039 --> 05:00:36.957
Caption: about this data

05:00:35.199 --> 05:00:39.039
Caption: what are the data types

05:00:36.957 --> 05:00:40.716
Caption: is that an integer or a decimal is it

05:00:39.039 --> 05:00:42.238
Caption: signed or unsigned

05:00:40.718 --> 05:00:43.681
Caption: is this field allowed to be null or

05:00:42.240 --> 05:00:46.320
Caption: should it have a default value when it&#39;s

05:00:43.679 --> 05:00:47.679
Caption: empty is there a primary key or is there

05:00:46.320 --> 05:00:50.560
Caption: a composite number of columns that

05:00:47.679 --> 05:00:52.240
Caption: should uniquely identify a row

05:00:50.560 --> 05:00:54.320
Caption: all of these questions are vitally

05:00:52.240 --> 05:00:56.560
Caption: important for us to actually utilize our

05:00:54.320 --> 05:00:57.839
Caption: data but they cannot be answered without

05:00:56.560 --> 05:00:59.441
Caption: structure

05:00:57.839 --> 05:01:01.279
Caption: this file for example could not be

05:00:59.439 --> 05:01:03.679
Caption: loaded into a data warehouse unless we

05:01:01.279 --> 05:01:06.478
Caption: knew what the structure was

05:01:03.679 --> 05:01:08.160
Caption: so what does structure look like

05:01:06.480 --> 05:01:09.919
Caption: i&#39;m going to throw another very common

05:01:08.160 --> 05:01:12.000
Caption: term around that everyone has heard but

05:01:09.919 --> 05:01:13.599
Caption: a lot of people don&#39;t really understand

05:01:12.000 --> 05:01:16.638
Caption: and that&#39;s metadata

05:01:13.599 --> 05:01:19.119
Caption: metadata is information about data

05:01:16.638 --> 05:01:21.121
Caption: in our csv example metadata could be an

05:01:19.119 --> 05:01:23.599
Caption: information file that provides answers

05:01:21.119 --> 05:01:26.000
Caption: to our questions data types unique

05:01:23.599 --> 05:01:27.519
Caption: constraints null handling

05:01:26.000 --> 05:01:29.359
Caption: now there&#39;s another common type of

05:01:27.519 --> 05:01:31.599
Caption: metadata involved with data lakes and

05:01:29.359 --> 05:01:33.679
Caption: that&#39;s governance data when we have

05:01:31.599 --> 05:01:35.919
Caption: hundreds or thousands of source systems

05:01:33.679 --> 05:01:37.359
Caption: feeding into one big data platform it&#39;s

05:01:35.919 --> 05:01:39.519
Caption: very important for us to know where that

05:01:37.359 --> 05:01:41.279
Caption: data came from who&#39;s responsible for it

05:01:39.519 --> 05:01:43.919
Caption: how often it&#39;s refreshed what the

05:01:41.279 --> 05:01:45.119
Caption: quality is there&#39;s lots of questions but

05:01:43.919 --> 05:01:46.957
Caption: for the sake of this speech we&#39;re going

05:01:45.119 --> 05:01:48.636
Caption: to focus on the first type

05:01:46.957 --> 05:01:50.558
Caption: which is the actual structure of our

05:01:48.638 --> 05:01:52.958
Caption: data we can see you know this string has

05:01:50.560 --> 05:01:54.878
Caption: a maximum length of 255. we can see that

05:01:52.957 --> 05:01:57.279
Caption: this field is nullable this is the

05:01:54.878 --> 05:01:58.878
Caption: structure to our data

05:01:57.279 --> 05:02:00.876
Caption: so

05:01:58.878 --> 05:02:03.121
Caption: what&#39;s very important to understand

05:02:00.878 --> 05:02:05.201
Caption: is that when we have unstructured data

05:02:03.119 --> 05:02:06.957
Caption: and the metadata that corresponds to it

05:02:05.199 --> 05:02:09.359
Caption: we can combine those two things to

05:02:06.957 --> 05:02:12.000
Caption: produce structured data

05:02:09.359 --> 05:02:13.119
Caption: okay

05:02:12.000 --> 05:02:15.199
Caption: so

05:02:13.119 --> 05:02:17.839
Caption: to solidify our metadata learnings

05:02:15.199 --> 05:02:20.000
Caption: metadata is information about data this

05:02:17.839 --> 05:02:22.000
Caption: information allows us to specifically

05:02:20.000 --> 05:02:24.080
Caption: describe the format and structure of our

05:02:22.000 --> 05:02:26.160
Caption: data and this allows us to treat the

05:02:24.080 --> 05:02:28.240
Caption: data as structured which unlocks new

05:02:26.160 --> 05:02:30.638
Caption: ways of analyzing storing and

05:02:28.240 --> 05:02:32.638
Caption: classifying the information

05:02:30.638 --> 05:02:35.121
Caption: now this is great but it feels like i&#39;m

05:02:32.638 --> 05:02:37.601
Caption: off on a tangent so why do we care about

05:02:35.119 --> 05:02:39.359
Caption: structure

05:02:37.599 --> 05:02:41.599
Caption: we care because of the definition of a

05:02:39.359 --> 05:02:43.839
Caption: data lake a centralized store for

05:02:41.599 --> 05:02:44.876
Caption: structured and unstructured data at any

05:02:43.839 --> 05:02:46.400
Caption: scale

05:02:44.878 --> 05:02:48.400
Caption: the first big difference between a data

05:02:46.400 --> 05:02:50.638
Caption: lake and a data warehouse is that data

05:02:48.400 --> 05:02:53.041
Caption: lakes accept any kind of data whereas

05:02:50.638 --> 05:02:55.121
Caption: warehouses only accept structure

05:02:53.039 --> 05:02:57.279
Caption: a good analogy is there&#39;s two toddlers

05:02:55.119 --> 05:02:59.279
Caption: and a playground one of them is the

05:02:57.279 --> 05:03:00.796
Caption: picky kid that only eats foods that are

05:02:59.279 --> 05:03:02.398
Caption: a certain color and then you have the

05:03:00.798 --> 05:03:03.361
Caption: one in the sandbox eating handfuls of

05:03:02.400 --> 05:03:04.798
Caption: sand

05:03:03.359 --> 05:03:06.398
Caption: it&#39;s not bothering anyone but he doesn&#39;t

05:03:04.798 --> 05:03:08.560
Caption: care he&#39;ll take anything in and that&#39;s

05:03:06.400 --> 05:03:10.560
Caption: what a dad lake is

05:03:08.560 --> 05:03:12.400
Caption: now in real life business systems the

05:03:10.560 --> 05:03:13.759
Caption: majority of our inputs are usually

05:03:12.400 --> 05:03:15.839
Caption: unstructured

05:03:13.759 --> 05:03:17.759
Caption: exports from apis data dumps from

05:03:15.839 --> 05:03:20.480
Caption: external systems and manually entered

05:03:17.759 --> 05:03:22.480
Caption: information is normally unstructured

05:03:20.480 --> 05:03:24.400
Caption: but as businesses want to make

05:03:22.480 --> 05:03:25.919
Caption: data-driven decisions we need all of

05:03:24.400 --> 05:03:27.599
Caption: this information to be stored in a

05:03:25.919 --> 05:03:29.359
Caption: structured way

05:03:27.599 --> 05:03:32.240
Caption: this is so we can accurately query it

05:03:29.359 --> 05:03:34.398
Caption: for business intelligence and analysis

05:03:32.240 --> 05:03:36.560
Caption: and that&#39;s what a data lake does

05:03:34.400 --> 05:03:38.878
Caption: it provides a single body for storing

05:03:36.560 --> 05:03:40.958
Caption: structured and unstructured data as well

05:03:38.878 --> 05:03:43.201
Caption: as defining automated processes for

05:03:40.957 --> 05:03:46.398
Caption: adding structure to that data

05:03:43.199 --> 05:03:48.318
Caption: let&#39;s dig into it a little bit more

05:03:46.400 --> 05:03:51.839
Caption: everyone loves aws architecture diagrams

05:03:48.320 --> 05:03:51.839
Caption: so i threw one in

05:03:53.519 --> 05:03:55.679
Caption: so

05:03:56.878 --> 05:04:00.718
Caption: let&#39;s walk through it step by step

05:03:58.957 --> 05:04:02.318
Caption: first on the left we have a range of

05:04:00.718 --> 05:04:04.638
Caption: data sources some of these are

05:04:02.320 --> 05:04:06.240
Caption: unstructured some are structured

05:04:04.638 --> 05:04:08.240
Caption: again that&#39;s the key difference between

05:04:06.240 --> 05:04:10.000
Caption: a data warehouse and a data lake all

05:04:08.240 --> 05:04:11.839
Caption: inputs are accepted

05:04:10.000 --> 05:04:13.679
Caption: next you&#39;ll notice there are two zones

05:04:11.839 --> 05:04:14.876
Caption: an unstructured zone and a structured

05:04:13.679 --> 05:04:16.160
Caption: zone

05:04:14.878 --> 05:04:18.638
Caption: it&#39;s very important we have both of

05:04:16.160 --> 05:04:20.400
Caption: these so that we can accept unstructured

05:04:18.638 --> 05:04:21.441
Caption: or structured data in from outside

05:04:20.400 --> 05:04:23.679
Caption: systems

05:04:21.439 --> 05:04:24.478
Caption: it&#39;s also very important because as we

05:04:23.679 --> 05:04:26.957
Caption: move

05:04:24.480 --> 05:04:29.519
Caption: data through a data lake

05:04:26.957 --> 05:04:31.279
Caption: generally we have a range of zones and

05:04:29.519 --> 05:04:33.599
Caption: as we move through those zones our

05:04:31.279 --> 05:04:35.839
Caption: structure sorry our data becomes more

05:04:33.599 --> 05:04:37.679
Caption: structured and has a higher quality to

05:04:35.839 --> 05:04:39.839
Caption: it that&#39;s why we&#39;ve got the structured

05:04:37.679 --> 05:04:41.199
Caption: zone to the right of the unstructured

05:04:39.839 --> 05:04:42.957
Caption: zone

05:04:41.199 --> 05:04:44.478
Caption: you can see between the two zones we

05:04:42.957 --> 05:04:47.519
Caption: have a glue job

05:04:44.480 --> 05:04:49.201
Caption: this is aws speak for an etl that&#39;s the

05:04:47.519 --> 05:04:50.480
Caption: extract transformer load we talked about

05:04:49.199 --> 05:04:52.238
Caption: earlier

05:04:50.480 --> 05:04:53.121
Caption: now this glue job takes unstructured

05:04:52.240 --> 05:04:55.279
Caption: data

05:04:53.119 --> 05:04:57.359
Caption: and it applies metadata

05:04:55.279 --> 05:04:58.796
Caption: to add structure to it and move it into

05:04:57.359 --> 05:05:00.796
Caption: the structured zone

05:04:58.798 --> 05:05:02.958
Caption: it&#39;s worth noting that you can&#39;t just

05:05:00.798 --> 05:05:05.681
Caption: throw a random csv in and expect the

05:05:02.957 --> 05:05:07.119
Caption: metadata to somehow be known for every

05:05:05.679 --> 05:05:10.957
Caption: source that you ingest from you need to

05:05:07.119 --> 05:05:12.876
Caption: have the metadata for that data set

05:05:10.957 --> 05:05:16.636
Caption: once that data is sitting safe and

05:05:12.878 --> 05:05:18.320
Caption: structured it can be brought into

05:05:16.638 --> 05:05:21.041
Caption: into the structured zone

05:05:18.320 --> 05:05:23.041
Caption: what i have here is a data warehouse and

05:05:21.039 --> 05:05:24.796
Caption: an s3 bucket but what&#39;s important to

05:05:23.039 --> 05:05:27.199
Caption: understand is that a data lake does not

05:05:24.798 --> 05:05:28.798
Caption: prescribe the tooling that we use okay

05:05:27.199 --> 05:05:30.796
Caption: you can have a data lake without a data

05:05:28.798 --> 05:05:32.798
Caption: warehouse or you can have one with one

05:05:30.798 --> 05:05:35.681
Caption: what matters is that you have a store

05:05:32.798 --> 05:05:37.841
Caption: for that structured data

05:05:35.679 --> 05:05:40.320
Caption: you can also see that we have a variety

05:05:37.839 --> 05:05:40.320
Caption: of business

05:05:40.839 --> 05:05:44.718
Caption: integrations like sage maker that

05:05:43.199 --> 05:05:46.957
Caption: applies artificial intelligence or

05:05:44.718 --> 05:05:49.919
Caption: predictive analysis over the data power

05:05:46.957 --> 05:05:51.919
Caption: bi for visualization and coding

05:05:49.919 --> 05:05:53.759
Caption: again these are not prescribed tools

05:05:51.919 --> 05:05:56.320
Caption: these are commonly used ones but what

05:05:53.759 --> 05:05:58.000
Caption: really matters in a data lake is that

05:05:56.320 --> 05:06:00.160
Caption: you allow for the integration of

05:05:58.000 --> 05:06:02.560
Caption: external services that provide this kind

05:06:00.160 --> 05:06:02.560
Caption: of value

05:06:02.798 --> 05:06:06.320
Caption: now data lakes also give us the

05:06:04.240 --> 05:06:08.958
Caption: opportunity to tap into a buzzword that

05:06:06.320 --> 05:06:12.480
Caption: executives go crazy for and that&#39;s real

05:06:08.957 --> 05:06:13.839
Caption: time it gives me shivers just saying it

05:06:12.480 --> 05:06:15.599
Caption: what is real time

05:06:13.839 --> 05:06:17.759
Caption: basically it means there&#39;s a very small

05:06:15.599 --> 05:06:19.519
Caption: turnaround between an event occurring

05:06:17.759 --> 05:06:21.439
Caption: and that data being presented to the end

05:06:19.519 --> 05:06:22.957
Caption: user that&#39;s it

05:06:21.439 --> 05:06:24.716
Caption: any modern data lake will provide

05:06:22.957 --> 05:06:26.876
Caption: tooling that allows you to stream high

05:06:24.718 --> 05:06:28.480
Caption: volumes of data in real time

05:06:26.878 --> 05:06:30.480
Caption: and the aws solution i&#39;m showing you

05:06:28.480 --> 05:06:32.480
Caption: here is a kinesis stream

05:06:30.480 --> 05:06:33.759
Caption: these streams go into a data store and

05:06:32.480 --> 05:06:35.919
Caption: then we have an external tool like

05:06:33.759 --> 05:06:37.199
Caption: grafana that reads it at very small time

05:06:35.919 --> 05:06:39.279
Caption: intervals

05:06:37.199 --> 05:06:42.636
Caption: again just one component inside the

05:06:39.279 --> 05:06:44.478
Caption: ecosystem of a data lake

05:06:42.638 --> 05:06:46.000
Caption: now

05:06:44.480 --> 05:06:48.160
Caption: this is why data lake solved the big

05:06:46.000 --> 05:06:50.560
Caption: data problem for everyday companies

05:06:48.160 --> 05:06:52.638
Caption: the cost efficiency and scalability of

05:06:50.560 --> 05:06:54.798
Caption: the modern cloud allows us to store

05:06:52.638 --> 05:06:56.638
Caption: enormous volumes of unstructured and

05:06:54.798 --> 05:06:58.080
Caption: structured data without any real

05:06:56.638 --> 05:07:00.160
Caption: specialist input

05:06:58.080 --> 05:07:02.160
Caption: we don&#39;t need big data phds to set up

05:07:00.160 --> 05:07:04.000
Caption: hadoop clusters and you rarely even need

05:07:02.160 --> 05:07:05.359
Caption: database administrators because all of

05:07:04.000 --> 05:07:06.400
Caption: your instances are running in managed

05:07:05.359 --> 05:07:08.398
Caption: services

05:07:06.400 --> 05:07:10.878
Caption: that might be controversial

05:07:08.400 --> 05:07:13.599
Caption: the problem of scaling is gone

05:07:10.878 --> 05:07:15.761
Caption: so big data sets aren&#39;t scary anymore

05:07:13.599 --> 05:07:18.160
Caption: i&#39;m sure other big scary problems didn&#39;t

05:07:15.759 --> 05:07:19.599
Caption: just take their place

05:07:18.160 --> 05:07:21.599
Caption: except they did

05:07:19.599 --> 05:07:24.160
Caption: common side effects of data lake usage

05:07:21.599 --> 05:07:26.320
Caption: include but are not limited to data

05:07:24.160 --> 05:07:28.560
Caption: governance issues performance con

05:07:26.320 --> 05:07:29.359
Caption: performance complaints and massive scope

05:07:28.560 --> 05:07:31.041
Caption: group

05:07:29.359 --> 05:07:32.796
Caption: when you have thousands of data sets

05:07:31.039 --> 05:07:34.876
Caption: coming from hundreds of sources being

05:07:32.798 --> 05:07:36.638
Caption: transformed left right and center it

05:07:34.878 --> 05:07:38.560
Caption: gets very messy understanding who&#39;s

05:07:36.638 --> 05:07:41.201
Caption: responsible for what data sets and what

05:07:38.560 --> 05:07:44.320
Caption: they get used for if at all

05:07:41.199 --> 05:07:46.478
Caption: next the 16 petabyte redshift cluster is

05:07:44.320 --> 05:07:49.121
Caption: going to be slower to query than a 500

05:07:46.480 --> 05:07:51.121
Caption: megabyte local ms access file

05:07:49.119 --> 05:07:53.039
Caption: that&#39;s the reality but end users don&#39;t

05:07:51.119 --> 05:07:55.839
Caption: care about your excuses

05:07:53.039 --> 05:07:57.839
Caption: and with scale come slow

05:07:55.839 --> 05:07:59.599
Caption: another big one is that now that we have

05:07:57.839 --> 05:08:01.279
Caption: all this amazing and readily accessible

05:07:59.599 --> 05:08:02.636
Caption: data we need to do more with it than

05:08:01.279 --> 05:08:04.478
Caption: just run reports

05:08:02.638 --> 05:08:06.240
Caption: data lakes represent a big step forward

05:08:04.480 --> 05:08:08.000
Caption: in enabling machine learning as well as

05:08:06.240 --> 05:08:09.201
Caption: predictive analysis and automated

05:08:08.000 --> 05:08:11.119
Caption: decision making

05:08:09.199 --> 05:08:12.636
Caption: because solving a problem isn&#39;t enough

05:08:11.119 --> 05:08:14.398
Caption: once we can do something we have to

05:08:12.638 --> 05:08:15.201
Caption: figure how to get the most value out of

05:08:14.400 --> 05:08:17.041
Caption: it

05:08:15.199 --> 05:08:19.279
Caption: and suddenly our problem of there&#39;s too

05:08:17.039 --> 05:08:20.876
Caption: much data to store becomes a problem of

05:08:19.279 --> 05:08:22.636
Caption: how do we get the most out of all this

05:08:20.878 --> 05:08:24.480
Caption: data that we have

05:08:22.638 --> 05:08:26.560
Caption: anyway this slide is not here for

05:08:24.480 --> 05:08:28.320
Caption: solutions only pessimism and now that we

05:08:26.560 --> 05:08:30.320
Caption: understand what a data lake is and how

05:08:28.320 --> 05:08:31.839
Caption: it killed big data we can move on to the

05:08:30.320 --> 05:08:34.400
Caption: next item

05:08:31.839 --> 05:08:36.000
Caption: which is other bodies of water

05:08:34.400 --> 05:08:39.759
Caption: now it&#39;s worth noting while i&#39;m here

05:08:36.000 --> 05:08:41.279
Caption: that this speech to some extent

05:08:39.759 --> 05:08:42.876
Caption: is an opinion piece

05:08:41.279 --> 05:08:45.119
Caption: there is no

05:08:42.878 --> 05:08:46.718
Caption: standard body that defines exactly what

05:08:45.119 --> 05:08:48.000
Caption: a data lake or a data point or a data

05:08:46.718 --> 05:08:49.201
Caption: bottle is

05:08:48.000 --> 05:08:50.878
Caption: they&#39;re just kind of terms that people

05:08:49.199 --> 05:08:53.119
Caption: have come up with and every company uses

05:08:50.878 --> 05:08:55.281
Caption: them in a slightly different way

05:08:53.119 --> 05:08:57.039
Caption: but

05:08:55.279 --> 05:08:59.439
Caption: for some reason a lot of next generation

05:08:57.039 --> 05:09:00.876
Caption: data infrastructure follows water naming

05:08:59.439 --> 05:09:03.199
Caption: so let&#39;s start with the biggest and the

05:09:00.878 --> 05:09:05.041
Caption: most difficult to understand the data

05:09:03.199 --> 05:09:06.160
Caption: swamp

05:09:05.039 --> 05:09:09.439
Caption: simply put

05:09:06.160 --> 05:09:10.958
Caption: a data swamp is a bad data lake

05:09:09.439 --> 05:09:12.716
Caption: data swamps come around when we have

05:09:10.957 --> 05:09:13.759
Caption: poor data quality or poor data

05:09:12.718 --> 05:09:16.000
Caption: governance

05:09:13.759 --> 05:09:18.320
Caption: they&#39;re bad don&#39;t do them any questions

05:09:16.000 --> 05:09:19.279
Caption: no good

05:09:18.320 --> 05:09:21.519
Caption: okay

05:09:19.279 --> 05:09:23.759
Caption: next we&#39;re moving down the scale a data

05:09:21.519 --> 05:09:25.919
Caption: puddle is a single purpose data lake

05:09:23.759 --> 05:09:27.359
Caption: used by a specialist team for a very

05:09:25.919 --> 05:09:29.279
Caption: specific reason

05:09:27.359 --> 05:09:31.199
Caption: it is often used as companies migrate

05:09:29.279 --> 05:09:32.716
Caption: into the cloud and want to dip their

05:09:31.199 --> 05:09:34.398
Caption: toes and test things out for one

05:09:32.718 --> 05:09:36.080
Caption: specific use case before they try to

05:09:34.400 --> 05:09:37.121
Caption: scale up and move their whole business

05:09:36.080 --> 05:09:38.560
Caption: over

05:09:37.119 --> 05:09:40.636
Caption: you can see this in my extravagant

05:09:38.560 --> 05:09:42.560
Caption: diagram where a collection of happy

05:09:40.638 --> 05:09:45.759
Caption: synergistic teams make use of a data

05:09:42.560 --> 05:09:48.560
Caption: lake whereas one sad lonely solitary

05:09:45.759 --> 05:09:49.839
Caption: team makes use of their sad lonely data

05:09:48.560 --> 05:09:51.201
Caption: puddle

05:09:49.839 --> 05:09:52.320
Caption: we don&#39;t see this too wild on the often

05:09:51.199 --> 05:09:53.679
Caption: and if i&#39;m honest i&#39;d never heard of

05:09:52.320 --> 05:09:55.679
Caption: this term before i started researching

05:09:53.679 --> 05:09:57.679
Caption: for this speech but these are generally

05:09:55.679 --> 05:09:58.957
Caption: used as a proof of concept or by a road

05:09:57.679 --> 05:10:00.480
Caption: team that is sick of their company&#39;s

05:09:58.957 --> 05:10:02.000
Caption: data architecture

05:10:00.480 --> 05:10:03.679
Caption: that said

05:10:02.000 --> 05:10:04.957
Caption: well that really resonated

05:10:03.679 --> 05:10:06.796
Caption: all right

05:10:04.957 --> 05:10:09.039
Caption: that said they provide an important role

05:10:06.798 --> 05:10:10.958
Caption: in our next body of water

05:10:09.039 --> 05:10:13.199
Caption: the data pond

05:10:10.957 --> 05:10:15.519
Caption: this can be described as a collection of

05:10:13.199 --> 05:10:17.439
Caption: small isolated data systems

05:10:15.519 --> 05:10:19.279
Caption: and you might have a dozen different

05:10:17.439 --> 05:10:21.759
Caption: teams who each have their own data

05:10:19.279 --> 05:10:24.240
Caption: puddle on shared infrastructure the key

05:10:21.759 --> 05:10:27.439
Caption: difference here between a data pond and

05:10:24.240 --> 05:10:30.240
Caption: a data lake is minimal shared governance

05:10:27.439 --> 05:10:32.160
Caption: or data the accounting team uses their

05:10:30.240 --> 05:10:34.000
Caption: accounting data that they ingested the

05:10:32.160 --> 05:10:36.080
Caption: engineering team uses their engineering

05:10:34.000 --> 05:10:38.638
Caption: data that they ingested but there&#39;s not

05:10:36.080 --> 05:10:40.400
Caption: a lot of crossover it&#39;s not one huge big

05:10:38.638 --> 05:10:42.798
Caption: lake of shared data that everyone taps

05:10:40.400 --> 05:10:44.878
Caption: into for their own purposes

05:10:42.798 --> 05:10:46.878
Caption: this again is often seen as a stepping

05:10:44.878 --> 05:10:50.000
Caption: stone to data lakes but for smaller

05:10:46.878 --> 05:10:51.041
Caption: companies it may be suitable on its own

05:10:50.000 --> 05:10:53.519
Caption: so

05:10:51.039 --> 05:10:54.957
Caption: in summary who killed big data

05:10:53.519 --> 05:10:57.679
Caption: it was the data lake

05:10:54.957 --> 05:11:00.078
Caption: in the cloud with the scalability

05:10:57.679 --> 05:11:02.000
Caption: in a more general sense cloud technology

05:11:00.080 --> 05:11:03.519
Caption: has provided everyday businesses with

05:11:02.000 --> 05:11:04.480
Caption: the ability to scale their data

05:11:03.519 --> 05:11:06.480
Caption: infrastructure

05:11:04.480 --> 05:11:08.400
Caption: much more easily than before and as a

05:11:06.480 --> 05:11:10.240
Caption: result the traditional methods that

05:11:08.400 --> 05:11:11.839
Caption: couldn&#39;t handle big data have become a

05:11:10.240 --> 05:11:14.080
Caption: thing of the past

05:11:11.839 --> 05:11:16.080
Caption: we&#39;ve learnt the data lakes are just big

05:11:14.080 --> 05:11:18.240
Caption: fancy ways of storing any kind of data

05:11:16.080 --> 05:11:19.919
Caption: that you want and data ponds and data

05:11:18.240 --> 05:11:23.121
Caption: puddles are scaled down less

05:11:19.919 --> 05:11:25.919
Caption: collaborative versions of data lakes

05:11:23.119 --> 05:11:25.919
Caption: are there any questions

05:11:27.839 --> 05:11:33.199
Caption: sure sorry i&#39;m putting on the spot there

05:11:30.160 --> 05:11:36.000
Caption: okay oh um

05:11:33.199 --> 05:11:40.080
Caption: is the unstructured data a key part of

05:11:36.000 --> 05:11:41.919
Caption: it being a data lake absolutely yeah um

05:11:40.080 --> 05:11:44.480
Caption: it&#39;s not just the size and scale

05:11:41.919 --> 05:11:46.400
Caption: available and structured structured data

05:11:44.480 --> 05:11:48.958
Caption: so the issue with the data warehouse the

05:11:46.400 --> 05:11:51.201
Caption: preceded lakes was that a database needs

05:11:48.957 --> 05:11:52.796
Caption: structure in order to ingest data so if

05:11:51.199 --> 05:11:54.796
Caption: you want to accept data sources from

05:11:52.798 --> 05:11:56.400
Caption: literally anywhere and not be picky you

05:11:54.798 --> 05:11:58.160
Caption: need to accept unstructured data because

05:11:56.400 --> 05:12:01.839
Caption: a lot of sources will give us

05:11:58.160 --> 05:12:01.839
Caption: unstructured data

05:12:08.160 --> 05:12:12.240
Caption: i was just gonna ask uh have you heard

05:12:09.839 --> 05:12:12.839
Caption: of the so-called lake house and you have

05:12:12.240 --> 05:12:14.480
Caption: an

05:12:12.839 --> 05:12:16.560
Caption: opinion

05:12:14.480 --> 05:12:18.878
Caption: yes um

05:12:16.560 --> 05:12:22.560
Caption: so lakehouse is commonly sold through

05:12:18.878 --> 05:12:24.798
Caption: databricks as one of their products um

05:12:22.560 --> 05:12:26.400
Caption: my understanding of it is it&#39;s very good

05:12:24.798 --> 05:12:27.761
Caption: for an organization that wants a data

05:12:26.400 --> 05:12:29.679
Caption: lake but doesn&#39;t have a lot of data

05:12:27.759 --> 05:12:31.359
Caption: engineering capability themselves so

05:12:29.679 --> 05:12:33.679
Caption: it&#39;s if you&#39;re laughing and you work for

05:12:31.359 --> 05:12:35.519
Caption: databricks or something

05:12:33.679 --> 05:12:37.279
Caption: it&#39;s a way of tying in machine learning

05:12:35.519 --> 05:12:39.039
Caption: and artificial intelligence and data

05:12:37.279 --> 05:12:41.279
Caption: governance all into a data lake it&#39;s a

05:12:39.039 --> 05:12:44.796
Caption: bit of an expansion of a data lake and

05:12:41.279 --> 05:12:44.796
Caption: it&#39;s a bit of a managed product

05:12:44.957 --> 05:12:47.119
Caption: cool

05:12:49.519 --> 05:12:52.400
Caption: all the way down the other end i saw you

05:12:50.878 --> 05:12:54.080
Caption: walk to the back just so i could ask

05:12:52.400 --> 05:12:56.878
Caption: that question

05:12:54.080 --> 05:12:58.400
Caption: and what are your thoughts on donna mesh

05:12:56.878 --> 05:13:00.958
Caption: new term to me

05:12:58.400 --> 05:13:03.679
Caption: yep i&#39;ll be honest

05:13:00.957 --> 05:13:03.679
Caption: what are your thoughts

05:13:03.919 --> 05:13:06.160
Caption: i think it&#39;s a way of solving some of

05:13:05.439 --> 05:13:08.160
Caption: the

05:13:06.160 --> 05:13:09.679
Caption: the problems that are going to come okay

05:13:08.160 --> 05:13:11.519
Caption: with

05:13:09.679 --> 05:13:13.599
Caption: data lakes and

05:13:11.519 --> 05:13:17.279
Caption: um data warehouses

05:13:13.599 --> 05:13:19.679
Caption: and rebuilding that monolith of data

05:13:17.279 --> 05:13:21.199
Caption: and but i was just wondering i won&#39;t go

05:13:19.679 --> 05:13:21.957
Caption: into detail

05:13:21.199 --> 05:13:25.839
Caption: your

05:13:21.957 --> 05:13:25.839
Caption: presentations yeah

05:13:32.560 --> 05:13:36.480
Caption: i can understand why

05:13:34.560 --> 05:13:38.798
Caption: the data lake is very appealing to

05:13:36.480 --> 05:13:40.638
Caption: company and i&#39;m curious about how

05:13:38.798 --> 05:13:42.718
Caption: in the wild people actually make use of

05:13:40.638 --> 05:13:44.240
Caption: it i mean like in your diagram there&#39;s

05:13:42.718 --> 05:13:46.320
Caption: there&#39;s the ai bolt on and there&#39;s a

05:13:44.240 --> 05:13:49.439
Caption: dashboard but what do people tend to

05:13:46.320 --> 05:13:49.439
Caption: actually do with their data lakes

05:13:49.839 --> 05:13:52.796
Caption: a lot of reporting

05:13:53.759 --> 05:13:57.359
Caption: generally from what i found companies

05:13:55.919 --> 05:13:59.919
Caption: will have

05:13:57.359 --> 05:14:02.240
Caption: segregated data silos and part of their

05:13:59.919 --> 05:14:04.160
Caption: technical revolution whatever is to move

05:14:02.240 --> 05:14:06.160
Caption: to a data lake and start to bring all of

05:14:04.160 --> 05:14:08.798
Caption: that data into one place i think that

05:14:06.160 --> 05:14:10.320
Caption: has some very real benefits in that

05:14:08.798 --> 05:14:11.521
Caption: previously you know opposite or

05:14:10.320 --> 05:14:13.519
Caption: different teams would have a lot of

05:14:11.519 --> 05:14:15.039
Caption: trouble accessing the data of other

05:14:13.519 --> 05:14:16.876
Caption: teams and there&#39;s a complete nightmare

05:14:15.039 --> 05:14:18.238
Caption: of managing you know 100 different

05:14:16.878 --> 05:14:19.601
Caption: database clusters and everyone having

05:14:18.240 --> 05:14:21.359
Caption: their own way

05:14:19.599 --> 05:14:22.636
Caption: there&#39;s very little governance in those

05:14:21.359 --> 05:14:23.679
Caption: so what i see

05:14:22.638 --> 05:14:25.441
Caption: happening is generally just

05:14:23.679 --> 05:14:28.240
Caption: consolidating all of that into one

05:14:25.439 --> 05:14:29.759
Caption: platform that everyone can use

05:14:28.240 --> 05:14:31.439
Caption: it does generate a lot of work for them

05:14:29.759 --> 05:14:34.400
Caption: because suddenly data governance becomes

05:14:31.439 --> 05:14:36.160
Caption: a must instead of a could um but largely

05:14:34.400 --> 05:14:40.240
Caption: what i see it used for is dashboards and

05:14:36.160 --> 05:14:42.080
Caption: reporting makes sense thanks cool

05:14:40.240 --> 05:14:43.359
Caption: i think we maybe have time for one more

05:14:42.080 --> 05:14:44.798
Caption: quick question

05:14:43.359 --> 05:14:46.796
Caption: um what about security so if you have

05:14:44.798 --> 05:14:48.560
Caption: everyone accessing this data lake how do

05:14:46.798 --> 05:14:50.560
Caption: you keep secure data from people who

05:14:48.560 --> 05:14:51.839
Caption: shouldn&#39;t see it sure

05:14:50.560 --> 05:14:53.759
Caption: um
