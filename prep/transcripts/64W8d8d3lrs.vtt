WEBVTT

00:00:01.289 --> 00:00:09.039
Caption: hi so a bit of a disclaimer upfront I&#39;m

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.929
Caption: gonna be talking more about the notify

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:14.409
Caption: the data breach scheme than how to win

00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:16.719
Caption: friends so if that&#39;s what you came for I

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:19.959
Caption: apologize there there was an asterisk

00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:21.819
Caption: there so my bases are covered

00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:25.629
Caption: really quick thank you to the sponsors

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:27.399
Caption: without which we wouldn&#39;t be here so

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:30.939
Caption: I&#39;ll start off with a bit of a feel

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:33.790
Caption: about means so obviously I am Cairo just

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.590
Caption: like the city in case you were wondering

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.880
Caption: I&#39;m an information security consultant

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.159
Caption: asterisk

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.350
Caption: I&#39;m also the per capita lead for the

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.819
Caption: Australian women insecurity network so

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:44.559
Caption: any of the girls out there if you&#39;re

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:46.720
Caption: interested in cyber security are working

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.100
Caption: in cyber security definitely hit me up

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.409
Caption: we&#39;d love to have you coming along to

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:53.680
Caption: our meetups and just a bit of a

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.840
Caption: disclaimer I&#39;m totally not a lawyer so

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.409
Caption: if you&#39;re gonna take this as legal

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.790
Caption: advice I take no responsibility for any

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:10.658
Caption: things that make our horribly horribly

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:12.099
Caption: wrong didn&#39;t I might go off cool alright

00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:14.438
Caption: I also spend way too much time on

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:17.649
Caption: Twitter so follow me I want more

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.780
Caption: followers that would be great so the

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.969
Caption: main reason we are here today is to talk

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:25.929
Caption: about the privacy Amendment notifiable

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:28.299
Caption: data breaches Act of 2017 so this became

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:30.789
Caption: a little last February about 18 months

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.179
Caption: ago and the scheme itself officially

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:37.450
Caption: kicked in on February 22nd of this year

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:39.819
Caption: so this act basically established breach

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:43.478
Caption: notification obligations for entities

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:45.309
Caption: that are subject to the Privacy Act so a

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:47.559
Caption: bit of a background on the Privacy Act

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:51.578
Caption: its Australian federal legislation

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:53.589
Caption: passed in 1988 same age as me it&#39;s

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.348
Caption: Australia&#39;s main privacy and data

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:59.108
Caption: protection law and it&#39;s what we describe

00:01:56.348 --> 00:02:01.359
Caption: as principles based legislation so it&#39;s

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.189
Caption: not a prescriptive list of technical

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.130
Caption: do&#39;s and don&#39;ts that companies have to

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.139
Caption: adhere to if they

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:08.059
Caption: we kind of set up the high-level

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:11.720
Caption: aspirations that we have in terms of

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:13.880
Caption: privacy and data protection it&#39;s been

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.369
Caption: updated three years or three times in

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.139
Caption: the past thirty years which i think is

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:20.598
Caption: pretty interesting given how much

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.919
Caption: technology and privacy has changed in

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:24.679
Caption: that 30 years so that&#39;s something to

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:26.899
Caption: keep in mind the main section of the

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:29.208
Caption: Privacy Act is the Australian privacy

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:31.098
Caption: principles so this sets out the

00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:33.169
Caption: obligations of organisations when it

00:02:31.098 --> 00:02:35.779
Caption: comes to protecting personal information

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:37.848
Caption: it also sets out a lot of rights that

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:40.369
Caption: individuals have so this is the right to

00:02:37.848 --> 00:02:43.250
Caption: request data is deleted the right to

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:46.399
Caption: have inaccurate data updated those kinds

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.889
Caption: of things one of the main things that

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:51.369
Caption: the Privacy Act defines is what actually

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:54.649
Caption: constitutes personal information

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:57.409
Caption: unhelpfully it defines it fairly vaguely

00:02:54.649 --> 00:03:00.259
Caption: as information that makes it known an

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.190
Caption: individual person exists so we all know

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:07.669
Caption: exactly what that means same thing this

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.319
Caption: definition actually gets it changes

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.599
Caption: regularly based on how the courts

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.309
Caption: actually interpret it so I don&#39;t know

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.250
Caption: how many of you followed the case of

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:17.929
Caption: then Grubb a couple of years ago he&#39;s a

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.809
Caption: tech journalist and you put in a request

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:24.138
Caption: to Telstra to get copies of all of his

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:26.988
Caption: metadata when he initially made this

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.730
Caption: request the courts ruled that he could

00:03:26.988 --> 00:03:31.039
Caption: have access to all of his IP logs

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:33.289
Caption: because they were logs

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:35.138
Caption: pertaining to his usage of a service and

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:38.708
Caption: therefore it was personal information

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:41.480
Caption: upon appeal from Telstra that

00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:43.578
Caption: interpretation was overruled and they

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:45.679
Caption: decided that the IP logs actually

00:03:43.578 --> 00:03:48.500
Caption: pertained to information about a service

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:50.179
Caption: rather than a person and therefore it

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.970
Caption: wasn&#39;t considered personal information

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:54.738
Caption: so there is that back and forth in terms

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.380
Caption: of what actually falls under this

00:03:54.738 --> 00:03:58.880
Caption: definition so it can be a little bit

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.988
Caption: vague so that&#39;s something to keep in

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.690
Caption: mind so we&#39;ll go over a bit about the

00:04:02.988 --> 00:04:08.419
Caption: OIC so this is the office of the

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.190
Caption: Australian Information Commission and

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:13.130
Caption: they&#39;re the main enforcement body for

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.809
Caption: the Privacy Act they&#39;re empowered to

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.809
Caption: investigate violations of privacy

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:20.119
Caption: there&#39;s two ways they can do that they

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:21.949
Caption: accept complaints from individuals when

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:24.859
Caption: they feel that an organisation has

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.660
Caption: violated their privacy or they can

00:04:24.859 --> 00:04:28.638
Caption: initiate an investigation of their own

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.559
Caption: accord so if something hits the news or

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.389
Caption: they receive industry news about

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:34.970
Caption: something they can decide if they&#39;re

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.860
Caption: empowered to investigate one of the main

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.100
Caption: issues that the way I see is they are

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:42.189
Caption: chronically underfunded the government

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.449
Caption: doesn&#39;t really give them a lot of money

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.419
Caption: if you go on their website at the moment

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.130
Caption: and submit a general request I think

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.009
Caption: there&#39;s about a four week wait time to

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.320
Caption: actually get a response and that&#39;s just

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:58.509
Caption: a general email request it&#39;s not even a

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.860
Caption: complaint so that&#39;s mildly concerning

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.259
Caption: there is actually a face to be an

00:05:00.859 --> 00:05:04.429
Caption: information Commissioner and a Privacy

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.449
Caption: Commissioner and there&#39;s supposed to be

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.579
Caption: two separate roles

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.110
Caption: they&#39;ve been fulfilled by the same

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:10.519
Caption: person for the last couple of years

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:18.079
Caption: because there&#39;s not enough funding to

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:21.410
Caption: have to really makes us protected

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:23.478
Caption: so the OSD has the power to take legal

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.729
Caption: action against organisations that are

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.820
Caption: found to be in violation of the Privacy

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:32.679
Caption: Act they can issue fines of up to three

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.679
Caption: million dollars in the case of

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:41.049
Caption: I can talk really loudly oh cool well

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:43.630
Caption: that&#39;s cool

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:45.759
Caption: so in the cases of the notify but data

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.149
Caption: breach scheme I think the maximum time

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:51.759
Caption: they can issue is about 2.4 million they

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:54.850
Caption: can also do a really really fun thing

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.220
Caption: known as enforceable undertakings and I

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.740
Caption: can guarantee you that any organization

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.350
Caption: that&#39;s investigated by the OIC their

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:05.410
Caption: number one goal is to not get one of

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.910
Caption: them it&#39;s essentially a legally

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.489
Caption: enforceable agreement that that

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.250
Caption: organization will do everything that the

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:16.239
Caption: OIC tells them to do to remediate any

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.130
Caption: issues I believe Optus at one point

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:20.348
Caption: entered into an enforceable undertaking

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.330
Caption: and it was about five years until they

00:06:20.348 --> 00:06:25.509
Caption: were actually done with everything they

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:27.129
Caption: were told to do so your opinion on that

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.470
Caption: will probably differ based on if you

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:34.479
Caption: work for that organization or not by

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:36.579
Caption: generally speaking it&#39;s a lot of work so

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.220
Caption: on to the actual notifiable data breach

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:41.799
Caption: scheme so unsurprisingly it basically

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.510
Caption: does what it says on the box it sets out

00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:45.220
Caption: the notification requirements for

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.089
Caption: entities that have experienced the

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.220
Caption: breach surprise of this coming into law

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:53.470
Caption: notification was entirely voluntary and

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.539
Caption: unsurprisingly not a lot of

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.880
Caption: organizations decided to tell people

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:00.098
Caption: when they had been breached obviously

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.529
Caption: there&#39;s a financial impact reputational

00:07:00.098 --> 00:07:03.519
Caption: impact and they don&#39;t really want to do

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:05.970
Caption: that

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:08.888
Caption: so as part of this breach their

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.130
Caption: organization has to do an assessment of

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:13.690
Caption: what the impact of that breach would be

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:16.509
Caption: to determine if it&#39;s actually eligible

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.940
Caption: for notification and once that&#39;s been

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:21.369
Caption: determined notification has to be

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.989
Caption: provided to both the oai scene I&#39;m the

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:25.589
Caption: individuals that are affected by the

00:07:22.989 --> 00:07:28.059
Caption: breach so there&#39;s two outcomes of this

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:29.889
Caption: the individuals are actually notified

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:32.259
Caption: that their dad has been breached and the

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:34.899
Caption: OAS he actually gets to gather a whole

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:37.509
Caption: bunch of statistics on data breaches

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:40.449
Caption: which is actually pretty cool the first

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:42.279
Caption: full quarter results have actually just

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:44.908
Caption: been released which you can read on the

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:47.589
Caption: IOC website it&#39;s really cool reading

00:07:44.908 --> 00:07:48.639
Caption: that was not sarcastic it sounded it but

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:51.549
Caption: it wasn&#39;t

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:55.119
Caption: so the first question is what entities

00:07:51.549 --> 00:07:57.218
Caption: are actually subject to this game so the

00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:59.709
Caption: scheme applies to all organizations

00:07:57.218 --> 00:08:01.449
Caption: currently subject to the Privacy Act and

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:04.209
Caption: this includes businesses government

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:06.369
Caption: agencies and not-for-profit groups that

00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:10.089
Caption: collect personal information that&#39;s the

00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:13.598
Caption: broad application there&#39;s a whole bunch

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:16.239
Caption: of exceptions to this so currently the

00:08:13.598 --> 00:08:17.649
Caption: Privacy Act doesn&#39;t apply to businesses

00:08:16.239 --> 00:08:20.229
Caption: with an annual turnover of less than

00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:23.348
Caption: three million dollars a year so small to

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:25.778
Caption: medium enterprise don&#39;t need to comply

00:08:23.348 --> 00:08:27.729
Caption: with it there is an exception to the

00:08:25.778 --> 00:08:30.638
Caption: exception just to make it really easy to

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:32.950
Caption: follow if your organization handles tax

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:35.559
Caption: file numbers or health and medical

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.329
Caption: information then you do need to comply

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:43.479
Caption: with the notifiable data breach scheme

00:08:37.328 --> 00:08:44.799
Caption: and I can guarantee this and are

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:48.398
Caption: probably going to get caught out at some

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:50.169
Caption: point one of the ones that concerns me

00:08:48.398 --> 00:08:53.409
Caption: the most is it doesn&#39;t apply to state or

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:55.229
Caption: territory agencies or organizations so

00:08:53.409 --> 00:08:59.139
Caption: the Privacy Act is federal legislation

00:08:55.229 --> 00:09:00.969
Caption: and it doesn&#39;t apply to actual state

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.910
Caption: agencies because states are empowered to

00:09:00.969 --> 00:09:07.719
Caption: make their own privacy legislation in

00:09:03.909 --> 00:09:09.609
Caption: w-a we don&#39;t have any at this point and

00:09:07.719 --> 00:09:12.338
Caption: if you think about the services that the

00:09:09.609 --> 00:09:13.599
Caption: w8 government actually provides it&#39;s a

00:09:12.338 --> 00:09:17.169
Caption: little bit concerning so that would

00:09:13.599 --> 00:09:19.838
Caption: cover public hospitals most primary and

00:09:17.169 --> 00:09:22.838
Caption: secondary schools that kind of stuff a

00:09:19.838 --> 00:09:24.669
Caption: little bit concerning and there&#39;s also

00:09:22.838 --> 00:09:26.768
Caption: an exception for registered political

00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:30.549
Caption: parties so they can do whatever they

00:09:26.768 --> 00:09:32.588
Caption: want with your data and employee records

00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:34.838
Caption: also aren&#39;t covered under the Privacy

00:09:32.588 --> 00:09:38.109
Caption: Act those are covered by workplace

00:09:34.838 --> 00:09:40.380
Caption: relations legislation the exception to

00:09:38.109 --> 00:09:43.119
Caption: that exception I&#39;m sensing a theme here

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.739
Caption: is that if you as an organization do

00:09:43.119 --> 00:09:47.648
Caption: outsource the management of your

00:09:44.739 --> 00:09:49.390
Caption: employee records then it is subject to

00:09:47.648 --> 00:09:51.880
Caption: the notifiable data breaches scheme

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:55.239
Caption: which is why there was the big major

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:57.160
Caption: breach recently had all of those

00:09:55.239 --> 00:09:59.138
Caption: organizations been handling their own

00:09:57.159 --> 00:10:01.448
Caption: data they wouldn&#39;t have actually had

00:09:59.138 --> 00:10:06.638
Caption: tell anyone so take from that what you

00:10:01.448 --> 00:10:08.708
Caption: will so in this case you only need to

00:10:06.638 --> 00:10:12.099
Caption: know five for Dad for the data breaches

00:10:08.708 --> 00:10:13.388
Caption: that are deemed to be eligible so first

00:10:12.099 --> 00:10:16.628
Caption: up we need to define what a breach

00:10:13.388 --> 00:10:19.508
Caption: actually is so the OU AIC defines a data

00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:22.540
Caption: breach as unauthorized access or

00:10:19.508 --> 00:10:24.518
Caption: disclosure of data as well as the loss

00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:27.188
Caption: of data where it could then lead to

00:10:24.518 --> 00:10:28.778
Caption: unauthorized access so if you

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:30.999
Caption: accidentally wipe all of your data

00:10:28.778 --> 00:10:33.039
Caption: that&#39;s fine if you leave all of your

00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:35.649
Caption: data on a hard drive on a bus and

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:38.648
Caption: someone may get hold of it not quite so

00:10:35.648 --> 00:10:40.599
Caption: fine so we&#39;re all they&#39;re only talking

00:10:38.648 --> 00:10:42.938
Caption: about breaches that involve personal

00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:45.128
Caption: information corporate data is not

00:10:42.939 --> 00:10:47.679
Caption: covered so if you work for a company and

00:10:45.129 --> 00:10:49.509
Caption: your corporate data gets hacked we don&#39;t

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:52.799
Caption: care really let&#39;s be honest but it&#39;s

00:10:49.508 --> 00:10:55.328
Caption: your own problem and the final

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:58.569
Caption: requirement is that the breach has to be

00:10:55.328 --> 00:11:01.469
Caption: likely to result in serious harm to the

00:10:58.568 --> 00:11:04.898
Caption: individual whose data has been breached

00:11:01.469 --> 00:11:07.438
Caption: so this is a pretty big question what

00:11:04.898 --> 00:11:10.719
Caption: actually constitutes serious harm

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:13.959
Caption: there&#39;s no again no legal definition of

00:11:10.719 --> 00:11:16.688
Caption: what exactly that means the OU AIC has

00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:19.088
Caption: issued this guidance which specifically

00:11:16.689 --> 00:11:22.600
Caption: calls out physical psychological

00:11:19.088 --> 00:11:25.539
Caption: emotional economic and financial harm as

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:28.028
Caption: well as harm to your reputation so

00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:30.969
Caption: there&#39;s a whole list of things that this

00:11:28.028 --> 00:11:35.159
Caption: could involve but the thing that kind of

00:11:30.969 --> 00:11:37.238
Caption: gets me is the requirement for a

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:39.789
Caption: reasonable person in the entity&#39;s

00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:42.699
Caption: position would identify this as a

00:11:39.789 --> 00:11:44.859
Caption: possible outcome of the data breach so

00:11:42.698 --> 00:11:48.278
Caption: essentially what this situation leads to

00:11:44.859 --> 00:11:51.188
Caption: is you have an organization doing an

00:11:48.278 --> 00:11:53.289
Caption: impact assessment of a breach on behalf

00:11:51.189 --> 00:11:56.829
Caption: of the people who are actually affected

00:11:53.289 --> 00:11:59.229
Caption: and that organization generally speaking

00:11:56.828 --> 00:12:01.419
Caption: is going to have a vested interest in

00:11:59.229 --> 00:12:05.229
Caption: determining that hey we don&#39;t actually

00:12:01.419 --> 00:12:07.059
Caption: need to do notification so there&#39;s that

00:12:05.229 --> 00:12:10.868
Caption: conflict of interest there which makes

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:11.679
Caption: me mildly uncomfortable the other thing

00:12:10.869 --> 00:12:15.220
Caption: that is kind

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:17.049
Caption: issue is that as individuals we all use

00:12:15.219 --> 00:12:19.838
Caption: a little bit of security speaker and I

00:12:17.049 --> 00:12:22.659
Caption: apologize we all have slightly different

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:25.028
Caption: threat models in our lives so what&#39;s

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:27.028
Caption: gonna cause serious harm to mean is not

00:12:25.028 --> 00:12:29.708
Caption: necessarily the same for other people

00:12:27.028 --> 00:12:31.869
Caption: everyone has different things that are

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:34.419
Caption: going to harm them and when it comes to

00:12:31.869 --> 00:12:37.208
Caption: an organization determining the

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:39.880
Caption: likelihood of serious harm its leaving

00:12:37.208 --> 00:12:41.409
Caption: out a lot of outliers which are

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.708
Caption: generally the people who are most

00:12:41.409 --> 00:12:46.119
Caption: vulnerable to experience harm so in

00:12:44.708 --> 00:12:47.829
Caption: those cases we&#39;re talking about people

00:12:46.119 --> 00:12:49.989
Caption: who&#39;ve been victims of domestic violence

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.640
Caption: people with sensitive medical histories

00:12:49.989 --> 00:12:53.799
Caption: that stuff like they might be

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.390
Caption: hiv-positive they might be sex workers

00:12:53.799 --> 00:13:00.429
Caption: they might have they might be homosexual

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:02.500
Caption: and that information getting out has

00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:05.409
Caption: much higher likelihood of causing harm

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.148
Caption: to those individuals than to people like

00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:09.929
Caption: me who aren&#39;t really controversial and

00:13:07.148 --> 00:13:12.429
Caption: have really only like allergic to bees

00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:14.320
Caption: so those are the outliers that are going

00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:15.520
Caption: to be missed in this impact assessment

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.880
Caption: and those are the people who are most

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:21.010
Caption: likely to be harmed so I&#39;ve kind of

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.838
Caption: personally object to anything privacy

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:26.440
Caption: related that doesn&#39;t take into account

00:13:22.838 --> 00:13:27.729
Caption: the most vulnerable people and that&#39;s

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.679
Caption: something we&#39;re seeing a lot with the my

00:13:27.729 --> 00:13:31.329
Caption: health record debate that&#39;s going on at

00:13:29.679 --> 00:13:36.520
Caption: the moment as well which I&#39;m not even

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:38.290
Caption: gonna touch have enough time so in terms

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.770
Caption: of deciding that breaches are ineligible

00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:43.389
Caption: for notification anything where you&#39;re

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.610
Caption: like there&#39;s no gonna be serious harm

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:47.980
Caption: but either the serious harm is unlikely

00:13:45.609 --> 00:13:52.329
Caption: or the likely level of harm is not

00:13:47.979 --> 00:13:55.028
Caption: serious and thirdly if you undertake

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:57.640
Caption: incident response activities in the case

00:13:55.028 --> 00:13:59.708
Caption: of a breach and you&#39;ve managed to reduce

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.100
Caption: the likelihood of the serious harm by

00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:04.989
Caption: doing that then the breach is no longer

00:14:02.099 --> 00:14:06.639
Caption: notifiable so for example let&#39;s say

00:14:04.989 --> 00:14:09.130
Caption: you&#39;re trying to send someone&#39;s medical

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.020
Caption: records off to another GP and you&#39;re

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.570
Caption: gonna do it by email because that&#39;s what

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:16.329
Caption: we all do and you send that to the wrong

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:18.880
Caption: person if you successfully manage to

00:14:16.328 --> 00:14:21.250
Caption: recall that email and it hasn&#39;t been

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.349
Caption: accessed no one&#39;s actually read it in

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.719
Caption: that case you&#39;ve managed to prevent the

00:14:23.349 --> 00:14:24.979
Caption: series

00:14:23.719 --> 00:14:28.369
Caption: come and therefore it&#39;s no longer

00:14:24.979 --> 00:14:30.708
Caption: notifiable one of the other exceptions

00:14:28.369 --> 00:14:33.018
Caption: is if notification with interfere with

00:14:30.708 --> 00:14:34.878
Caption: law enforcement activity so let&#39;s say

00:14:33.018 --> 00:14:37.188
Caption: you work for an Internet service

00:14:34.879 --> 00:14:39.620
Caption: provider you&#39;re intercepting phone calls

00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:43.759
Caption: on behalf of law enforcement cuz you&#39;ve

00:14:39.619 --> 00:14:46.250
Caption: got a warrant hopefully if that data was

00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:48.018
Caption: breached in that case if you actually

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:50.208
Caption: notified that individual you would be

00:14:48.018 --> 00:14:52.489
Caption: compromising that investigation

00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:53.898
Caption: so you still have to notify the oai

00:14:52.489 --> 00:14:56.719
Caption: thing but you don&#39;t have to actually

00:14:53.898 --> 00:14:59.028
Caption: tell the person and that determination

00:14:56.719 --> 00:15:02.388
Caption: has to be made by the CEO of the

00:14:59.028 --> 00:15:06.588
Caption: organization there&#39;s also a blanket

00:15:02.388 --> 00:15:09.198
Caption: exception for secrecy provisions and

00:15:06.588 --> 00:15:12.828
Caption: this is basically all the easier secret

00:15:09.198 --> 00:15:15.768
Caption: squirrel stuff and finally you can apply

00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:18.528
Caption: to that way I see to get an exception I

00:15:15.768 --> 00:15:21.049
Caption: don&#39;t think this is ever really gonna be

00:15:18.528 --> 00:15:24.469
Caption: used but I&#39;d be interested to see who

00:15:21.049 --> 00:15:26.088
Caption: tries it what the outcome is so whether

00:15:24.469 --> 00:15:29.808
Caption: or not that would be publicized as a

00:15:26.088 --> 00:15:31.578
Caption: whole other thing so in terms of the

00:15:29.809 --> 00:15:32.750
Caption: notification that has to be sent out

00:15:31.578 --> 00:15:35.778
Caption: there are some very specific

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:38.179
Caption: requirements so notifications to

00:15:35.778 --> 00:15:39.828
Caption: individuals have to include obviously

00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:42.438
Caption: the name of the organisation and how

00:15:39.828 --> 00:15:44.359
Caption: they can contact you has to have a

00:15:42.439 --> 00:15:47.300
Caption: description of the breach can be fairly

00:15:44.359 --> 00:15:49.638
Caption: brief you have to include the kinds of

00:15:47.299 --> 00:15:51.409
Caption: information that were breached so is it

00:15:49.638 --> 00:15:54.409
Caption: just contact information is it credit

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:57.078
Caption: card information is it medical stuff you

00:15:54.409 --> 00:15:58.338
Caption: have to actually disclose that and then

00:15:57.078 --> 00:16:01.278
Caption: you also have to include recommendations

00:15:58.338 --> 00:16:04.369
Caption: of next steps that those individuals can

00:16:01.278 --> 00:16:06.708
Caption: take to protect themselves from serious

00:16:04.369 --> 00:16:08.539
Caption: harm so for most situations this is

00:16:06.708 --> 00:16:11.028
Caption: going to be something like changing

00:16:08.539 --> 00:16:13.698
Caption: passwords may be entering into credit

00:16:11.028 --> 00:16:15.138
Caption: monitoring cancelling credit cards or

00:16:13.698 --> 00:16:17.869
Caption: that kind of stuff so you do need to

00:16:15.138 --> 00:16:19.549
Caption: provide that advice I&#39;m interested to

00:16:17.869 --> 00:16:21.349
Caption: see what kind of liability this

00:16:19.549 --> 00:16:24.679
Caption: introduces for people if they follow

00:16:21.349 --> 00:16:26.448
Caption: that advice but that&#39;s something we&#39;ll

00:16:24.679 --> 00:16:29.479
Caption: see come out as this game gets more

00:16:26.448 --> 00:16:32.000
Caption: mature if it&#39;s not actually possible to

00:16:29.479 --> 00:16:33.729
Caption: notify individuals directly so if you

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.169
Caption: don&#39;t have

00:16:33.729 --> 00:16:38.229
Caption: to date contact information or something

00:16:35.169 --> 00:16:40.750
Caption: like that you can publish your statement

00:16:38.229 --> 00:16:42.250
Caption: covering the breach with all of the

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:45.130
Caption: information that would have been in a

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:47.229
Caption: direct notification and you also have to

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:49.239
Caption: take reasonable proactive steps to

00:16:47.229 --> 00:16:51.549
Caption: actually publicize that so you can&#39;t

00:16:49.239 --> 00:16:54.940
Caption: just hide a link in the corner of your

00:16:51.549 --> 00:16:57.039
Caption: website and hope that no one sees it how

00:16:54.940 --> 00:17:00.278
Caption: far the o AIC will take that well I

00:16:57.039 --> 00:17:02.289
Caption: guess we&#39;ll see in terms of notifying

00:17:00.278 --> 00:17:04.178
Caption: the o AIC themselves they have

00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:06.668
Caption: unsurprisingly made this very quite

00:17:04.178 --> 00:17:09.130
Caption: quite easy for organizations to do there

00:17:06.668 --> 00:17:10.828
Caption: is a handy-dandy website which I put up

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.938
Caption: there but you can just google it as well

00:17:10.828 --> 00:17:14.558
Caption: which basically contains all the

00:17:12.938 --> 00:17:21.068
Caption: information that organizations need to

00:17:14.558 --> 00:17:22.630
Caption: give them as part of a notification so I

00:17:21.068 --> 00:17:24.308
Caption: guess the big question is what do you

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.708
Caption: actually do if you work for an

00:17:24.308 --> 00:17:28.418
Caption: organization and you need to comply with

00:17:26.708 --> 00:17:33.069
Caption: this and I&#39;m hoping people have already

00:17:28.418 --> 00:17:36.189
Caption: done them I&#39;ll put my security

00:17:33.069 --> 00:17:38.500
Caption: consultant had on a number one you need

00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:40.149
Caption: to know your stuff you need to know what

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:43.058
Caption: information you actually are storing

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.469
Caption: where you&#39;re storing it what you

00:17:43.058 --> 00:17:46.390
Caption: actually do to protect it and if you

00:17:44.469 --> 00:17:47.798
Caption: would actually know if there was a

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.989
Caption: breach if you&#39;ve got no detective

00:17:47.798 --> 00:17:51.729
Caption: controls in place you&#39;re gonna have no

00:17:49.989 --> 00:17:54.790
Caption: idea and not knowing that you had a

00:17:51.729 --> 00:17:57.790
Caption: breach isn&#39;t really a way to get out of

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:59.770
Caption: having to notify people another thing

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.510
Caption: I&#39;d mention is definitely be considering

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:04.540
Caption: what information you&#39;re collecting and

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:06.040
Caption: why if you don&#39;t need to collect

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.540
Caption: information you probably shouldn&#39;t

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.910
Caption: because then you don&#39;t have to protect

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.250
Caption: it you should also have incident

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:14.140
Caption: response plans in place so once you

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.808
Caption: detect the breach hopefully you should

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:18.609
Caption: know how to respond you should have an

00:18:16.808 --> 00:18:21.250
Caption: assessment process in place so that you

00:18:18.609 --> 00:18:23.020
Caption: can actually assess that impact and show

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:25.569
Caption: you&#39;re working should the o AIC come

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:28.450
Caption: knocking and actually ask what you&#39;ve

00:18:25.569 --> 00:18:30.609
Caption: done and finally have a communication

00:18:28.449 --> 00:18:31.659
Caption: plan in place and so you know what

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:35.319
Caption: you&#39;re gonna say and how you&#39;re gonna

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:37.510
Caption: say it if you do need to do that so

00:18:35.319 --> 00:18:39.130
Caption: that&#39;s pretty much all I had I realized

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:42.719
Caption: I got through the entire thing without a

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.719
Caption: main so I&#39;ve chucked it at the end

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.869
Caption: all right it was close so yeah if anyone

00:18:45.189 --> 00:18:51.929
Caption: does have any questions I wants to chat

00:18:46.869 --> 00:18:51.930
Caption: I&#39;ll be around all day so just hit me up

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:58.190
Caption: [Applause]
