Caption: yeah

00:00:02.059 --> 00:00:07.500
Caption: alrighty guys thank you for coming to

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:09.899
Caption: our talk today so today we&#39;ve actually

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.019
Caption: got a fellow Telstra purple senior

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:15.659
Caption: consultant with us Brenton 80. he&#39;ll be

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.979
Caption: doing a talk on training a PowerPoint AI

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:22.920
Caption: to play Tic-Tac-Toe now he is actually a

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:25.799
Caption: tutor also for the University of Western

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.959
Caption: Australia data and analytics boot camp

00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:30.538
Caption: he&#39;s got a pretty interesting background

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:34.020
Caption: with a Bachelor of Science majoring in

00:00:30.538 --> 00:00:35.700
Caption: maths and psychological science and a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.799
Caption: master of Applied Artificial

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.379
Caption: Intelligence on the way

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:42.659
Caption: daughter is a rapidly growing domain and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.579
Caption: it is his vision to spread awareness of

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.878
Caption: the power that comes with taking control

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:50.718
Caption: of data over to you Brinton wonderful

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.719
Caption: cool

00:00:55.919 --> 00:01:03.779
Caption: so uh pretty provocative title there uh

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.879
Caption: a little bit click-baity uh surely this

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:07.680
Caption: is just a trick you might say just like

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:10.739
Caption: a play on words to get you through those

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.779
Caption: doors and don&#39;t worry we will get into

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:14.519
Caption: it we will get into this magical

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:16.739
Caption: PowerPoint AI

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:18.839
Caption: but before I talk about that we need to

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:20.519
Caption: understand what AI is what artificial

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:22.139
Caption: intelligence is

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:24.599
Caption: more specifically we&#39;re going to talk

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:27.059
Caption: about one Avenue that we get through to

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:29.758
Caption: get to AI which is machine learning

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:32.339
Caption: so before we go any further

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.020
Caption: feel like I do have to warn you guys

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:37.258
Caption: this isn&#39;t actually a talk about

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:39.478
Caption: PowerPoint or tic-tac-toe

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.159
Caption: if you came in here hoping to get the

00:01:39.478 --> 00:01:44.459
Caption: latest tips and tricks on creating

00:01:41.158 --> 00:01:47.399
Caption: flashy slide decks and and mastering the

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:50.699
Caption: game of tic-tac-toe then well one I&#39;m

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.559
Caption: profoundly sorry and two you maybe

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:53.699
Caption: should have read the talk description a

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:57.180
Caption: little bit more

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:59.039
Caption: there&#39;s time to leave if you want um

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.500
Caption: but AI then

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.380
Caption: AI is a term that floats around a lot

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.479
Caption: these days it&#39;s usually is some ex

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:09.238
Caption: machina style magic to solve all of the

00:02:06.478 --> 00:02:11.279
Caption: world&#39;s problems which I mean it&#39;s great

00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:13.199
Caption: for me because it means that I get to

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:16.800
Caption: wander around pretending like I&#39;m some

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:19.259
Caption: Chris Angel in my day job analyzing data

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.080
Caption: but you see a magician never Reveals His

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:23.458
Caption: Secrets the difference here me a data

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.860
Caption: scientist I&#39;m going to take you behind

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:28.619
Caption: the curtain and see how simple machine

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.419
Caption: learning and AI really are and how

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:32.659
Caption: applicable it is to so many different

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:34.979
Caption: scenarios more than you might expect

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.440
Caption: even say

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:39.000
Caption: a PowerPoint

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.738
Caption: but if we&#39;re going to talk about machine

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.779
Caption: learning and some of you might be aware

00:02:40.738 --> 00:02:45.800
Caption: of this then there&#39;s something we can&#39;t

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.800
Caption: avoid talking about

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:50.878
Caption: maths

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.160
Caption: that&#39;s right I tricked you all into a 45

00:02:50.878 --> 00:02:58.619
Caption: minute lecture I&#39;m grueling repetitive

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.559
Caption: complex maths

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:03.000
Caption: who&#39;s excited

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:05.039
Caption: except

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.720
Caption: we don&#39;t really need to talk about maths

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.458
Caption: to talk about machine learning

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.500
Caption: as much as I would love to get into

00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:12.360
Caption: intricacies of stochastic gradient

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.179
Caption: descent or cross-entropy loss between

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.979
Caption: distributions those of you who just felt

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:19.500
Caption: the blood rush from your face as I

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:21.720
Caption: mentioned the word maths can relax just

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.458
Caption: a little bit

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.860
Caption: but then that begs the question if we&#39;re

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:28.679
Caption: not going to talk about maths

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.779
Caption: what are we going to talk about

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:32.878
Caption: you see if you looked on the definition

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:35.518
Caption: of machine learning from our friendly

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:37.860
Caption: site Wikipedia you would get

00:03:35.518 --> 00:03:40.080
Caption: machine learning algorithms build a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.639
Caption: model based on Sample data known as

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.699
Caption: training data in order to make

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:47.279
Caption: predictions decisions without being

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:49.559
Caption: explicitly programmed to do so

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.940
Caption: that bit&#39;s important so keep it in the

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:53.158
Caption: back of your mind

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.199
Caption: but this is wild right this must be some

00:03:53.158 --> 00:03:57.238
Caption: wild new innovation we&#39;ve got sample

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.098
Caption: data we&#39;re making predictions and

00:03:57.238 --> 00:04:01.559
Caption: decisions

00:03:59.098 --> 00:04:04.759
Caption: except this quote is often attributed to

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.759
Caption: someone called Arthur Samuel

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.479
Caption: in 1952

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:11.279
Caption: Arthur Samuel was a pioneer of machine

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.919
Caption: learning in IBM and he was Building

Caption: 1949.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.059
Caption: but what about all this stuff I&#39;m

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.460
Caption: hearing about neural networks computer

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:25.739
Caption: vision surely being able to get a

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:28.638
Caption: computer to see images that must be new

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:28.638
Caption: and wild right

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.720
Caption: this is a schematic for the Mark 1

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.100
Caption: perceptron this and is an initial

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.779
Caption: machine learning algorithm that was

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.020
Caption: trying to mimic the workings of the

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:41.820
Caption: human mind which sounds super fancy it

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:44.879
Caption: was used in early computer vision models

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.580
Caption: to for image recognition

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.440
Caption: in 1957

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:51.119
Caption: now although the technology has changed

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.739
Caption: a little bit the same fundamental

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:54.359
Caption: principles are still being used today

00:04:52.739 --> 00:04:56.220
Caption: and are solely responsible for the

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:58.859
Caption: Resurgence we saw in neural networks in

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.079
Caption: 1990s

00:04:58.859 --> 00:05:02.099
Caption: this might be a bit strange not what you

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:04.619
Caption: would expect

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.199
Caption: but you see despite what the buzzwords

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:09.000
Caption: might say machine learning is not just

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.100
Caption: for Big Data

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.019
Caption: machine learning is not just for

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.580
Caption: large-scale compute for people who have

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:16.739
Caption: all the money in the world to throw at

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:18.720
Caption: which maybe Microsoft will get mad at me

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:23.119
Caption: for saying um

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.119
Caption: machine learning is it&#39;s not Magic

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.639
Caption: if that&#39;s what machine learning is not

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.119
Caption: then what is machine learning

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:35.160
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk about what machine

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:37.019
Caption: learning is and hopefully by the end of

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.059
Caption: this you&#39;ll be able to come on me with

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:40.679
Caption: the come with me on the journey to how

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:41.639
Caption: we can create machine learning out of

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:43.859
Caption: something

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.300
Caption: stupid

00:05:43.859 --> 00:05:46.739
Caption: machine learning is a way of

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:48.659
Caption: constructing a model that describes

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:50.880
Caption: things about the real world without

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.019
Caption: having to explicitly program it every

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.940
Caption: detail

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:55.619
Caption: in a way it&#39;s about transferring

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.299
Caption: Knowledge from the unknown from the

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:59.579
Caption: known to the unknown

00:05:57.299 --> 00:06:02.159
Caption: and we do this sort of learning in real

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:04.859
Caption: day lives every day so much so that it&#39;s

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.899
Caption: pretty much second nature

00:06:04.859 --> 00:06:09.000
Caption: when I was a kid I spent a lot of hours

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:10.619
Caption: playing the guitar

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.259
Caption: probably should have spent more hours

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:15.419
Caption: doing my hair

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:17.759
Caption: this is the sacrifices we make right

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.320
Caption: except for one time in high school where

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:21.000
Caption: we were auditioning for a musical which

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.600
Caption: the mic is important

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.859
Caption: um and maybe five six upwards of that

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.300
Caption: amount of people were trying to audition

00:06:25.859 --> 00:06:29.038
Caption: for guitar but no one was auditioning

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:30.539
Caption: for Bass and I said

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.919
Caption: how hard can it be going from six

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.239
Caption: strings to four

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.240
Caption: easy

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:37.859
Caption: except any musician who is tried to

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:39.539
Caption: transfer from guitar to Bass will know

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:41.339
Caption: that there are transferable skills

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:43.860
Caption: there&#39;s a lot more knowledge that you

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:46.500
Caption: need to gain before you can successfully

00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:48.478
Caption: play the bass my first few performances

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.600
Caption: I absolutely bombed

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:52.979
Caption: I thought I started out thinking that I

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.619
Caption: would have all my knowledge in guitar

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.479
Caption: that would easily transfer it into

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:59.539
Caption: um bass but this wasn&#39;t the case it was

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:02.519
Caption: only after successive practicing

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:05.239
Caption: learnings failings that I managed to get

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:05.239
Caption: to where I am today

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:10.459
Caption: put it another way let&#39;s assume we have

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:12.899
Caption: a group of people much like yourselves

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:14.220
Caption: tasked with predicting the result of a

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:16.799
Caption: coin flip

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.559
Caption: and for every correct guess you get a

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:20.819
Caption: cookie that&#39;s just so that we make sure

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:22.919
Caption: that people take this very serious

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.779
Caption: experiment seriously

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:27.240
Caption: without prior knowledge except for the

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:28.919
Caption: fact that maybe a coin has two sides I

00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:31.440
Caption: think we can agree within a certain

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:33.360
Caption: margin of error that 50 of the group

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.380
Caption: will get a cookie

00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:40.079
Caption: so we run this one flip turns up heads

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.779
Caption: two flips turns up heads

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:45.539
Caption: three flips heads and what a coincidence

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:46.619
Caption: some might say others might start to

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:48.959
Caption: catch on

00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:51.839
Caption: four flips turns up heads

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:53.459
Caption: five flips turns up heads and a group

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:56.880
Caption: start might start getting suspicious

00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:59.519
Caption: cookies are flying left and right

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.440
Caption: given enough time people will learn the

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:04.138
Caption: ploy of this con man

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:07.440
Caption: it is no ordinary coin

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:10.020
Caption: the group starts around here 50 percent

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.639
Caption: but then with successive coin flips and

00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:14.519
Caption: the promise of cookies getting ever more

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:17.098
Caption: enticing we start to learn with coins

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:19.619
Caption: true nature nature

00:08:17.098 --> 00:08:21.179
Caption: by guessing and getting it wrong or

00:08:19.619 --> 00:08:24.199
Caption: guessing and getting it right and being

00:08:21.179 --> 00:08:27.000
Caption: rewarded constantly over and over again

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:29.339
Caption: we can start to induce that the

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.459
Caption: information is not that the coin is a

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:34.760
Caption: regular coin but it is a double-sided

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:34.760
Caption: double-headed coin

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.119
Caption: so

00:08:38.158 --> 00:08:43.200
Caption: what is that how can we abstract that

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:45.838
Caption: away from that experience of us learning

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.179
Caption: after successive coin flips and apply it

00:08:45.838 --> 00:08:50.159
Caption: to Something in the maths world or the

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:52.018
Caption: computer world

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:54.379
Caption: there are many types of machine learning

00:08:52.018 --> 00:08:56.700
Caption: that you might have heard of supervised

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.380
Caption: unsupervised reinforcement learning

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.480
Caption: semi-supervised

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:04.458
Caption: but fundamentally they all follow the

00:09:00.479 --> 00:09:04.458
Caption: same three basic steps

00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:11.398
Caption: we need to create a test

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:13.320
Caption: what is the model trying to do

00:09:11.398 --> 00:09:14.219
Caption: we need to define a way to score the

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.500
Caption: test

00:09:14.219 --> 00:09:19.139
Caption: how well do we how do we tell if a model

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:22.080
Caption: is good or bad or what it&#39;s trying to do

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.000
Caption: and lastly most importantly we need to

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.880
Caption: find a way to punish or reward the model

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.338
Caption: for the score it received

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.320
Caption: so again the idea here is that if we

00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:33.359
Caption: take the fundamental components of what

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.820
Caption: a machine learning algorithm is

00:09:33.359 --> 00:09:38.640
Caption: stripping away all the maths complexity

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:40.799
Caption: and high compute power we can find ways

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.420
Caption: to implement it in something simple and

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:44.159
Caption: we need to know these steps if we&#39;re

00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:47.579
Caption: going to build an AI from the ground up

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:50.338
Caption: with machine learning in say

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.440
Caption: a PowerPoint maybe I don&#39;t know is that

00:09:50.338 --> 00:09:54.119
Caption: why you&#39;re here

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.739
Caption: indulge me for a minute while we walk

00:09:54.119 --> 00:09:57.719
Caption: down metaphor Lane

00:09:55.739 --> 00:09:59.518
Caption: we&#39;re going to open up Brenton School of

00:09:57.719 --> 00:10:02.099
Caption: machine learning studies

00:09:59.518 --> 00:10:05.398
Caption: in this school we have students day in

00:10:02.099 --> 00:10:08.219
Caption: day out trying to produce results

00:10:05.398 --> 00:10:11.039
Caption: school is the model and our students are

00:10:08.219 --> 00:10:13.379
Caption: just instances of training that model

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:15.659
Caption: get this school to learn and perform in

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.859
Caption: one of the top schools we need to define

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:19.018
Caption: a test

00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:21.299
Caption: this test is how we&#39;re going to judge

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:23.039
Caption: how well the school performs when we

00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:25.559
Caption: conduct a test each student will get a

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:27.239
Caption: score and our student score is and our

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:28.559
Caption: school score is some aggregation of the

00:10:27.239 --> 00:10:30.179
Caption: student score

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:32.039
Caption: who doesn&#39;t love standardized tests

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:34.080
Caption: right

00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:35.940
Caption: after the test we need to Define what it

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.380
Caption: means to pass or fail it

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.359
Caption: what does it mean for a student to do

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.940
Caption: well in the test what is a good score

00:10:39.359 --> 00:10:44.219
Caption: what is a bad score for the school

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.359
Caption: what will end us end up in US losing

00:10:44.219 --> 00:10:47.778
Caption: funding and turning off the lights

00:10:45.359 --> 00:10:47.778
Caption: forever

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:53.099
Caption: lastly we need to Define how we&#39;re going

00:10:51.479 --> 00:10:56.880
Caption: to punish the students who have failed

00:10:53.099 --> 00:10:58.979
Caption: and reward those who did well

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.958
Caption: this is a standardized test and again

00:10:58.979 --> 00:11:02.880
Caption: our score will be based off the

00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.559
Caption: aggregated score of all of our students

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.000
Caption: so we want to maximize the amount of

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:09.380
Caption: students passing

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.380
Caption: by whatever means necessary

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:15.600
Caption: and we do this many many times

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:17.338
Caption: each time a student is getting punished

00:11:15.599 --> 00:11:20.699
Caption: if it gets the test wrong or it&#39;s

00:11:17.338 --> 00:11:22.440
Caption: getting rewarded if it&#39;s doing it better

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.179
Caption: it&#39;s important to note here that the

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.220
Caption: students are the one learning after each

00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:28.380
Caption: test they are what makes this machine

00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:32.578
Caption: learning school a machine learning model

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:34.619
Caption: and you can&#39;t just go ahead and reward

00:11:32.578 --> 00:11:36.000
Caption: or punish a school in as a whole anyone

00:11:34.619 --> 00:11:37.260
Caption: who&#39;s tried to organize any group of

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.599
Caption: kids will know that that&#39;s just not

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.820
Caption: possible what you do have control over

00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:43.979
Caption: is the individual students running their

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.880
Caption: tests and you have the ability to learn

00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:50.059
Caption: to get them to learn or change their

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.059
Caption: scores

00:11:50.099 --> 00:11:54.599
Caption: now you might say a different approach

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.000
Caption: to this is to try and get every student

00:11:54.599 --> 00:12:00.419
Caption: to memorize the answer of every single

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.799
Caption: test question in the test which yes it&#39;s

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:04.500
Caption: an option it will get a pretty good

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:06.239
Caption: score but then say a new school board

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.398
Caption: runs around and says we don&#39;t like this

00:12:06.239 --> 00:12:10.078
Caption: test we&#39;re going to define a new one all

00:12:08.398 --> 00:12:12.239
Caption: of a sudden you have to do all of the

00:12:10.078 --> 00:12:14.219
Caption: rework and getting all of these hundreds

00:12:12.239 --> 00:12:16.859
Caption: thousands of students in the school to

00:12:14.219 --> 00:12:18.659
Caption: relearn their answers it&#39;s not efficient

00:12:16.859 --> 00:12:22.559
Caption: and I know that I can&#39;t memorize a

00:12:18.659 --> 00:12:25.078
Caption: standardized test for the best of days

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:28.200
Caption: the key thing here is that you can run a

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:30.479
Caption: test on any model but if there exists no

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.760
Caption: process to punish or reward the model

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:35.760
Caption: based on the test score then it&#39;s simply

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.739
Caption: not a machine learning model

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.419
Caption: so that&#39;s a little bit of fun down

00:12:37.739 --> 00:12:40.859
Caption: metaphor Lane but let&#39;s look at this in

00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:42.419
Caption: the real world

00:12:40.859 --> 00:12:45.539
Caption: what you&#39;re looking at here is an

00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:47.159
Caption: example of the mnist data set it&#39;s sort

00:12:45.539 --> 00:12:49.259
Caption: of said as the hello world of computer

00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:52.458
Caption: vision whatever that&#39;s worth

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:55.100
Caption: data set containing 70 000 labeled

00:12:52.458 --> 00:12:58.500
Caption: handwritten digits

00:12:55.099 --> 00:13:00.958
Caption: uh 10 60 000 of those are training in

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.760
Caption: six ten thousand of those are testing

00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:05.700
Caption: the name of the game is to get a model

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:08.940
Caption: that classifies an unseen hand written

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.559
Caption: digit as zero through to nine

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.679
Caption: so in this case our test is pretty

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:17.039
Caption: simple is the predicted digit equal to

00:13:13.679 --> 00:13:19.500
Caption: the actual labeled digit

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:21.059
Caption: so if we try and approach this in the

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.219
Caption: simplest way possible

00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:24.778
Caption: our first model might be

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:27.239
Caption: random guess

00:13:24.778 --> 00:13:28.979
Caption: this is about as simple as we can get we

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:31.799
Caption: just simply ran get randomly guess a

00:13:28.979 --> 00:13:34.138
Caption: number between 0 and 9 and assign the

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:35.880
Caption: label to be that

00:13:34.138 --> 00:13:38.099
Caption: this model is quite easy to test

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.898
Caption: actually in fact if we did it then we

00:13:38.099 --> 00:13:42.179
Caption: would find that it&#39;s about 10 accurate

00:13:39.898 --> 00:13:46.078
Caption: and that&#39;s much like guessing a random

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:47.398
Caption: coin is 50 right accurate

00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:50.338
Caption: however

00:13:47.398 --> 00:13:52.679
Caption: we have no way to change the model&#39;s

00:13:50.338 --> 00:13:55.200
Caption: behavior when it gets things right or we

00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:58.138
Caption: can&#39;t alter it when it gets things wrong

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.220
Caption: our model&#39;s accuracy will always be 10

00:13:58.138 --> 00:14:01.619
Caption: percent

00:13:59.219 --> 00:14:03.719
Caption: hence I&#39;m a model is not a machine

00:14:01.619 --> 00:14:07.799
Caption: learning model

00:14:03.719 --> 00:14:10.379
Caption: so 10 percent not that great one in

00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:13.320
Caption: every 10 digit gets it wrong

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:15.179
Caption: so let&#39;s try a better approach

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.778
Caption: this time we&#39;re going to relate a model

00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:21.299
Caption: to the image&#39;s darkness which might seem

00:14:18.778 --> 00:14:23.518
Caption: a bit strange but you might expect an

00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:25.200
Caption: image of an 8 to be darker than an image

00:14:23.518 --> 00:14:27.359
Caption: of a one and maybe a little bit darker

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.480
Caption: of an image of a three it&#39;s more ink

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:32.398
Caption: involved so there&#39;s more Darkness

00:14:30.479 --> 00:14:34.260
Caption: this model is a little bit better in

00:14:32.398 --> 00:14:36.778
Caption: practice we see that the accuracy

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:38.880
Caption: averages to about 22 percent which is

00:14:36.778 --> 00:14:41.760
Caption: twice as good as randomly guessing

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.799
Caption: but it&#39;s still only one in four one in

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.600
Caption: five getting it right

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:48.919
Caption: I think

00:14:45.599 --> 00:14:48.919
Caption: we can do better than that

00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:53.398
Caption: crucially again there was no way to

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:55.859
Caption: alter the model&#39;s Behavior

00:14:53.398 --> 00:14:57.838
Caption: when it&#39;s dark and it predicts it to be

00:14:55.859 --> 00:15:00.000
Caption: an eight it&#39;ll always do that regardless

00:14:57.838 --> 00:15:02.820
Caption: if it was just a really heavily uh

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.559
Caption: highlighted five

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.078
Caption: so let&#39;s see if we can apply what we

00:15:04.559 --> 00:15:10.698
Caption: just learned in the school metaphor for

00:15:07.078 --> 00:15:10.698
Caption: creating machine learning algorithms

00:15:11.239 --> 00:15:15.539
Caption: don&#39;t worry about the code in two

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:17.518
Caption: details this is an extract taken from a

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:19.018
Caption: book that I dearly love called neural

00:15:17.518 --> 00:15:20.880
Caption: networks and deep learning by Michael

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:23.338
Caption: Nielsen

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.260
Caption: uh for those interested this is uh what

00:15:23.338 --> 00:15:26.278
Caption: this is again what we call a neural

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:29.220
Caption: network

00:15:26.278 --> 00:15:31.559
Caption: but crucially what this has is what the

00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:34.078
Caption: other two models didn&#39;t it has a way to

00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:35.099
Caption: reward good test scores and punish bad

00:15:34.078 --> 00:15:37.919
Caption: ones

00:15:35.099 --> 00:15:40.679
Caption: every times it runs its own tests it&#39;ll

00:15:37.919 --> 00:15:42.958
Caption: find a way to calculate how different

00:15:40.679 --> 00:15:44.638
Caption: the predicted value was from the

00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:46.919
Caption: expected value

00:15:44.638 --> 00:15:50.719
Caption: and then alter the model in some way

00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:50.719
Caption: that favors the way that it got it right

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:56.458
Caption: the key magic in here is uh we feed

00:15:53.398 --> 00:15:57.838
Caption: fraud back propagation approach this

00:15:56.458 --> 00:16:01.018
Caption: takes the output of a cost function

00:15:57.838 --> 00:16:02.698
Caption: cross entropy in this case to test how

00:16:01.018 --> 00:16:05.278
Caption: how different the prediction was from

00:16:02.698 --> 00:16:08.099
Caption: the expected and it Alters the model uh

00:16:05.278 --> 00:16:10.380
Caption: based on stochastic gradient descent

00:16:08.099 --> 00:16:12.119
Caption: which honestly it&#39;s pretty simple it&#39;s

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.619
Caption: just based on the train rule of deriving

00:16:12.119 --> 00:16:17.179
Caption: matrices

00:16:13.619 --> 00:16:17.179
Caption: except I said no maths

00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:20.239
Caption: I&#39;ll break

00:16:20.578 --> 00:16:24.719
Caption: the model here is a machine learning

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.479
Caption: model

00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:30.778
Caption: it had a test the is the predicted value

00:16:27.479 --> 00:16:32.880
Caption: equal to the actual labeled digit

00:16:30.778 --> 00:16:35.099
Caption: it has a way of determining a good or

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.078
Caption: bad score in this case I said it was the

00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:39.059
Caption: cross entropy function

00:16:37.078 --> 00:16:42.539
Caption: and it has a way of altering the model&#39;s

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:44.338
Caption: Behavior the stochastic gradient descent

00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:45.659
Caption: don&#39;t have to know how it works you just

00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:48.719
Caption: have to know that it&#39;s there and there&#39;s

00:16:45.659 --> 00:16:50.879
Caption: a method of applying this punishment or

00:16:48.719 --> 00:16:52.500
Caption: reward

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.198
Caption: but

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.518
Caption: the mnist is a pretty typical example I

00:16:55.198 --> 00:16:57.778
Caption: said it was like the hello world of

00:16:56.518 --> 00:17:00.359
Caption: computer vision

00:16:57.778 --> 00:17:01.559
Caption: in it we had a very clear labeled

00:17:00.359 --> 00:17:03.179
Caption: objective

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:05.338
Caption: if our model

00:17:03.179 --> 00:17:08.040
Caption: didn&#39;t predict the correct label for the

00:17:05.338 --> 00:17:10.619
Caption: digit then it&#39;s not up to scratch

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.419
Caption: sometimes the test and the score aren&#39;t

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:14.338
Caption: so clear-cut

00:17:12.418 --> 00:17:16.198
Caption: the interest interesting examples in the

00:17:14.338 --> 00:17:19.678
Caption: industry around the test isn&#39;t so clear

00:17:16.198 --> 00:17:23.039
Caption: and a bad score is equally just as vague

00:17:19.678 --> 00:17:25.458
Caption: see labeling digits is easy

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.500
Caption: but what about if you&#39;re trying to just

00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:30.660
Caption: transcribe somebody&#39;s piano playing and

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.699
Caption: as an audio file and transcribe that

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.859
Caption: into manuscript music that somebody

00:17:32.699 --> 00:17:38.279
Caption: would read

00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:39.719
Caption: this is a paper uh called onsets and

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.820
Caption: Frames dual objective piano

00:17:39.719 --> 00:17:42.780
Caption: transcription and they try to do just

00:17:41.819 --> 00:17:45.538
Caption: that

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:47.760
Caption: now the paper is full of fun maths and

00:17:45.538 --> 00:17:49.379
Caption: data science jargon but the point of

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.000
Caption: Interest here is when the authors tried

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.000
Caption: to describe how they base the model

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.160
Caption: accuracy for velocity

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.140
Caption: as they say it&#39;s been a pretty hard nut

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.000
Caption: to crack I mean sure you can tell if a

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.099
Caption: note written on paper is the same as the

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.260
Caption: note what was played you can even test

00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:06.298
Caption: whether the transcribe for note falls on

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.459
Caption: the same beat give or take

00:18:06.298 --> 00:18:09.899
Caption: but how do you capture Dynamics volume

00:18:08.459 --> 00:18:12.599
Caption: expression

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.160
Caption: a note pitch is a note pitch but what

00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:16.678
Caption: reference does a note&#39;s loudness have

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.820
Caption: who&#39;s to say the recording just isn&#39;t

00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:19.619
Caption: really loud or there&#39;s a lot of

00:18:17.819 --> 00:18:22.319
Caption: background noise

00:18:19.619 --> 00:18:24.058
Caption: additionally how do you correct a given

00:18:22.319 --> 00:18:25.619
Caption: notes volume based on the content when

00:18:24.058 --> 00:18:27.359
Caption: the context that it appears in is

00:18:25.619 --> 00:18:29.699
Caption: arguably more important

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:30.538
Caption: a soft note compared to a really loud

00:18:29.699 --> 00:18:32.939
Caption: note

00:18:30.538 --> 00:18:36.239
Caption: has different uh meanings than if you

00:18:32.939 --> 00:18:39.359
Caption: just have a sequence of soft notes

00:18:36.239 --> 00:18:41.160
Caption: so I love academic papers the authors

00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:43.079
Caption: are kind of hand wavy at this point

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.000
Caption: they&#39;re saying that they&#39;ve discovered a

00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:46.319
Caption: never-before-seen method to truly test

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.439
Caption: whether their model perfectly

00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:51.538
Caption: transcribes the Dynamics of a player

00:18:48.439 --> 00:18:54.119
Caption: Forte fortissimo piano

00:18:51.538 --> 00:18:56.639
Caption: however it&#39;s important to note that all

00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:58.319
Caption: that&#39;s been done is some math magic to

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.900
Caption: calculate a score based on the average

00:18:58.319 --> 00:19:03.298
Caption: volume of the recording

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:07.080
Caption: they didn&#39;t discover any brand new

00:19:03.298 --> 00:19:09.899
Caption: method they simply defined a test

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:11.459
Caption: the test could have easily been all

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.380
Caption: notes of the correct volume if they&#39;re

00:19:11.459 --> 00:19:15.058
Caption: below negative five decibels

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.739
Caption: that&#39;s a test and the model would have

00:19:15.058 --> 00:19:18.119
Caption: been really good at transcribing all

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:20.719
Caption: notes that are below negative five

00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:20.719
Caption: decibels

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.678
Caption: so these are the three key things that

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:29.819
Caption: we&#39;ve got to keep in our minds moving

00:19:28.678 --> 00:19:31.918
Caption: forward

00:19:29.819 --> 00:19:33.359
Caption: to have a machine learning model you

00:19:31.918 --> 00:19:36.298
Caption: have to have a test

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:38.579
Caption: a score and then a way to punish or

00:19:36.298 --> 00:19:40.859
Caption: award based on that score

00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:43.439
Caption: sometimes these are pretty easy to

00:19:40.859 --> 00:19:45.599
Caption: understand say for example if is your

00:19:43.439 --> 00:19:47.879
Caption: digit equal to the labeled digit

00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:49.739
Caption: sometimes it can be a bit more vague in

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.959
Caption: the case of when you&#39;re trying to

00:19:49.739 --> 00:19:52.918
Caption: transcribe music notes or when you&#39;re

00:19:51.959 --> 00:19:56.599
Caption: trying to

00:19:52.918 --> 00:19:56.599
Caption: play Tic-Tac-Toe for example

00:19:59.538 --> 00:20:05.579
Caption: so that was a lot

00:20:02.939 --> 00:20:07.619
Caption: but this creates the fundamentals of

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:09.719
Caption: what we&#39;re going to use as we go through

00:20:07.619 --> 00:20:11.520
Caption: the Journey on how you might do

00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:14.159
Caption: something strange

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.799
Caption: see machine learning is more than just

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.479
Caption: classification and regression

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:20.880
Caption: machine learning can be used in any

00:20:18.479 --> 00:20:23.400
Caption: application that uses the three key

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.979
Caption: principles when you define a test when

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:29.460
Caption: you calculate a score and then provide

00:20:25.979 --> 00:20:32.219
Caption: some sort of punishment or reward

00:20:29.459 --> 00:20:34.380
Caption: and if you don&#39;t believe me well

00:20:32.219 --> 00:20:38.459
Caption: this is where the fun comes in

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:39.780
Caption: training an AI to play Tic-tac-toe

00:20:38.459 --> 00:20:42.239
Caption: except

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.919
Caption: that might not really get you convinced

00:20:42.239 --> 00:20:46.439
Caption: right maybe I&#39;m just going to pull out

00:20:43.918 --> 00:20:48.899
Caption: my Python and do some math magic and

00:20:46.439 --> 00:20:50.519
Caption: then that doesn&#39;t convince you at all

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.260
Caption: what about if we tried to find a

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.179
Caption: scenario in which we didn&#39;t have any of

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:59.000
Caption: that available to us we don&#39;t have any

00:20:54.178 --> 00:20:59.000
Caption: code we don&#39;t have any fancy compute

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:05.460
Caption: yeah I think this will do a better job

00:21:03.239 --> 00:21:06.780
Caption: I mentioned before Arthur Samuel who

00:21:05.459 --> 00:21:10.020
Caption: spent a large part of his career

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.880
Caption: utilizing the best IBM computers at the

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.859
Caption: time to create revolutionary new machine

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.418
Caption: learning programs

00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:16.859
Caption: I wonder what he&#39;d think if he saw his

00:21:15.418 --> 00:21:19.339
Caption: whole what life&#39;s work reduced to a

00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:19.339
Caption: slide deck

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:25.199
Caption: now inter typical consultant fashion I

00:21:23.459 --> 00:21:26.579
Caption: will label some caveats here and really

00:21:25.199 --> 00:21:28.558
Caption: Define the scope of what we&#39;re going to

00:21:26.579 --> 00:21:30.479
Caption: be working with

00:21:28.558 --> 00:21:32.219
Caption: the aim of the game is to demonstrate

00:21:30.479 --> 00:21:33.959
Caption: that machine learning is no more

00:21:32.219 --> 00:21:37.260
Caption: complicated than any other algorithm

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:38.459
Caption: once stripped down to its fundamentals

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.440
Caption: hence

00:21:38.459 --> 00:21:43.558
Caption: no code is allowed

00:21:40.439 --> 00:21:45.959
Caption: now full disclosure I did use some

00:21:43.558 --> 00:21:49.380
Caption: macros as you will soon see to get this

00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:51.058
Caption: working involved many slides and

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.039
Caption: many

00:21:51.058 --> 00:21:54.500
Caption: many animations

00:21:53.038 --> 00:21:57.779
Caption: so

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:59.459
Caption: to save myself an eternity I hacked some

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:02.039
Caption: old VBA scripts to automate the

00:21:59.459 --> 00:22:03.779
Caption: insertion of animations and slides we

00:22:02.038 --> 00:22:05.459
Caption: will not be using these in the method

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:08.039
Caption: for training the PowerPoint I want to

00:22:05.459 --> 00:22:09.298
Caption: make that very clear

00:22:08.038 --> 00:22:11.519
Caption: secondly

00:22:09.298 --> 00:22:14.959
Caption: for the game theorists out there there

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:18.320
Caption: is about uh 255

00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:20.699
Caption: 168 possible games of tic-tac-toe

00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:22.199
Caption: this number varies slightly depending on

00:22:20.699 --> 00:22:24.000
Caption: how you define what a game of

00:22:22.199 --> 00:22:26.219
Caption: tic-tac-toe is but needless to say

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.500
Caption: that&#39;s a very big number

00:22:26.219 --> 00:22:30.359
Caption: um so to narrow this down I&#39;ve reduced

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:34.500
Caption: the problem to training a PowerPoint

00:22:30.359 --> 00:22:36.619
Caption: tic-tac-toe to win in three moves or

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:40.260
Caption: more likely it&#39;s uh training a

00:22:36.619 --> 00:22:42.239
Caption: tic-tac-toe to not lose in three moves

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.500
Caption: but you know that doesn&#39;t that&#39;s not as

00:22:42.239 --> 00:22:46.020
Caption: catchy

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:48.839
Caption: in addition the AI will always make the

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:51.179
Caption: first move and always in a corner

00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:52.979
Caption: see the game of tic-tac-toe actually

00:22:51.178 --> 00:22:54.839
Caption: varies quite significantly depending on

00:22:52.979 --> 00:22:57.298
Caption: which player goes first so we&#39;re going

00:22:54.839 --> 00:22:59.719
Caption: to just highlight one example of this

00:22:57.298 --> 00:22:59.719
Caption: game state

00:23:00.058 --> 00:23:04.199
Caption: where possible we will utilize

00:23:01.678 --> 00:23:05.939
Caption: Reflections and rotations so that a

00:23:04.199 --> 00:23:07.798
Caption: computer will never make a move that is

00:23:05.939 --> 00:23:09.779
Caption: a reflection or rotation of another

00:23:07.798 --> 00:23:12.119
Caption: state that it can move to

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.219
Caption: what does that mean in this example

00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:16.140
Caption: there are only three places that an AI

00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:18.058
Caption: will try to place

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.760
Caption: itself

00:23:18.058 --> 00:23:21.599
Caption: the left the bottom left and then the

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.000
Caption: bottom

00:23:21.599 --> 00:23:26.880
Caption: this is because the other blank spaces

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.380
Caption: are just reflections of those moves the

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:32.239
Caption: right and bottom right are just

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.239
Caption: reflections of the left and bottom left

00:23:32.459 --> 00:23:36.658
Caption: us human players will have no such

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:39.959
Caption: restrictions

00:23:36.659 --> 00:23:41.480
Caption: this leaves us with a still not tiny

00:23:39.959 --> 00:23:44.099
Caption: number of

00:23:41.479 --> 00:23:47.298
Caption: 1830 possible game states that you can

00:23:44.099 --> 00:23:47.298
Caption: have for Tic-tac-toe

00:23:47.699 --> 00:23:52.739
Caption: um I&#39;ll take the time here to thank the

00:23:50.219 --> 00:23:55.260
Caption: inspiration uh that cursed me with this

00:23:52.739 --> 00:23:57.298
Caption: uh project uh first was the work by

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:59.280
Caption: mathematician and comedian uh there are

00:23:57.298 --> 00:24:01.199
Caption: some of us who are funny by the name of

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.760
Caption: Matt Parker who ran a project and

00:24:01.199 --> 00:24:04.619
Caption: training a machine learning algorithm to

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.900
Caption: play Tic-Tac-Toe based on a set of

00:24:04.619 --> 00:24:10.140
Caption: matchboxes and this was off the work of

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:12.000
Caption: Donald Mickey in 1961.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.320
Caption: if you ask me they&#39;re kind of cheating a

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.659
Caption: little bit they only have to deal with

00:24:13.319 --> 00:24:18.000
Caption: this approximately 700 possible states

00:24:15.659 --> 00:24:20.220
Caption: that the tic-tac-toe board can be in and

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.579
Caption: there was a lot of human intervention so

00:24:20.219 --> 00:24:26.158
Caption: you know not throwing any shade but

00:24:23.579 --> 00:24:28.619
Caption: the second uh was a video by Tom

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:31.020
Caption: wilderhane who really opened my eyes to

00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:33.839
Caption: the programming potential of PowerPoint

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:36.419
Caption: in his uh absurd ideas in computer

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:38.640
Caption: science PowerPoint programming uh it&#39;s a

00:24:36.418 --> 00:24:41.519
Caption: great watch

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:44.039
Caption: so PowerPoint then

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.179
Caption: now I&#39;ve heard from the streets that

00:24:44.038 --> 00:24:47.219
Caption: some people are under the false

00:24:45.178 --> 00:24:49.099
Caption: impression that PowerPoint is not the

00:24:47.219 --> 00:24:53.038
Caption: greatest tool ever invented

00:24:49.099 --> 00:24:55.140
Caption: well if I&#39;m shocked I mean PowerPoint

00:24:53.038 --> 00:24:56.819
Caption: has literally everything you could want

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:59.700
Caption: from a programming language

00:24:56.819 --> 00:25:01.139
Caption: it has text

00:24:59.699 --> 00:25:03.000
Caption: it has

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:06.260
Caption: shapes

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.260
Caption: and most importantly

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:09.379
Caption: has animations

00:25:10.739 --> 00:25:13.859
Caption: that&#39;s a totally random animation by the

00:25:12.599 --> 00:25:15.479
Caption: way the first time I&#39;m seeing it it&#39;s

00:25:13.859 --> 00:25:18.058
Caption: always fun

00:25:15.479 --> 00:25:19.739
Caption: you may laugh but the shapes and

00:25:18.058 --> 00:25:21.599
Caption: animations actually the key to what

00:25:19.739 --> 00:25:23.099
Caption: allow us to form a real machine learning

00:25:21.599 --> 00:25:24.479
Caption: model with PowerPoint

00:25:23.099 --> 00:25:26.339
Caption: because they allow us to do something

00:25:24.479 --> 00:25:27.418
Caption: that developers take for granted every

00:25:26.339 --> 00:25:30.199
Caption: day

00:25:27.418 --> 00:25:30.199
Caption: State Management

00:25:30.239 --> 00:25:34.979
Caption: in our model each slide will represent a

00:25:33.178 --> 00:25:36.719
Caption: particular move from either the player

00:25:34.979 --> 00:25:38.520
Caption: or the AI

00:25:36.719 --> 00:25:40.859
Caption: we will then use these shapes and

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.959
Caption: animations to manage that state to

00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:46.918
Caption: remember what they learn

00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:49.319
Caption: so our model will consist of 1830 states

00:25:46.918 --> 00:25:51.979
Caption: which is one thousand eight hundred and

00:25:49.319 --> 00:25:51.979
Caption: thirty slides

00:25:52.979 --> 00:25:55.979
Caption: each slide State consists of the

00:25:54.839 --> 00:25:59.219
Caption: following

00:25:55.979 --> 00:26:00.538
Caption: simply the board which is the number of

00:25:59.219 --> 00:26:02.760
Caption: naughts and crosses in their relative

00:26:00.538 --> 00:26:04.678
Caption: positions to each other

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.859
Caption: um in this case AI is cross and human

00:26:04.678 --> 00:26:10.099
Caption: player is not uh that just felt right I

00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:10.099
Caption: don&#39;t know

00:26:10.339 --> 00:26:15.058
Caption: and also we all contain all of the

00:26:13.319 --> 00:26:17.699
Caption: previous steps that got us to that state

00:26:15.058 --> 00:26:20.880
Caption: using uh one of my favorite PowerPoint

00:26:17.699 --> 00:26:22.859
Caption: features Zoom transitions

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:26.760
Caption: so this encodes all of the information

00:26:22.859 --> 00:26:29.099
Caption: that got us to the state that we were in

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:31.199
Caption: it allows us to bop but back propagate

00:26:29.099 --> 00:26:33.479
Caption: through each path and get to the slide

00:26:31.199 --> 00:26:35.699
Caption: that led up to it

00:26:33.479 --> 00:26:38.520
Caption: so that&#39;s the state that&#39;s what we&#39;re

00:26:35.699 --> 00:26:41.699
Caption: trying to capture in a slide but how do

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:43.320
Caption: you transition from one state to another

00:26:41.699 --> 00:26:46.019
Caption: well there are two different types of

00:26:43.319 --> 00:26:47.819
Caption: turns there&#39;s a player&#39;s turn and an

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:50.039
Caption: ai&#39;s turn

00:26:47.819 --> 00:26:52.079
Caption: for the player a collection of shapes

00:26:50.038 --> 00:26:54.778
Caption: that place a naught and navigate to the

00:26:52.079 --> 00:26:55.859
Caption: relevant slide are on every single Blank

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:58.020
Caption: Space

00:26:55.859 --> 00:27:00.479
Caption: they&#39;re invisible so they don&#39;t have any

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.159
Caption: fill color or outline color but they do

00:27:00.479 --> 00:27:03.298
Caption: have a hyperlink to the slide that is

00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:06.120
Caption: relevant

00:27:03.298 --> 00:27:08.639
Caption: every click on an empty space navigates

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:11.038
Caption: the user to a new slide where that knot

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.200
Caption: is in the location that was clicked so

00:27:11.038 --> 00:27:15.359
Caption: for this slide there are eight invisible

00:27:13.199 --> 00:27:17.219
Caption: shapes but they are there and they

00:27:15.359 --> 00:27:19.140
Caption: hyperlink to the relevant slide when a

00:27:17.219 --> 00:27:21.719
Caption: user clicks one

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.219
Caption: we go to that slide and notice in the

00:27:21.719 --> 00:27:25.439
Caption: top left hand corner we&#39;ve saved the

00:27:23.219 --> 00:27:28.158
Caption: state of what it was previously by using

00:27:25.439 --> 00:27:28.158
Caption: the zoom transition

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:35.279
Caption: so that&#39;s the player but what about the

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:37.739
Caption: AI how do we get the AI to navigate

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:40.380
Caption: and this is where things get interesting

00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:42.599
Caption: now to be sure a human player still

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.640
Caption: clicks the AI we&#39;re not building a

00:27:42.599 --> 00:27:48.719
Caption: PowerPoint to control a mouse just yet

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:50.579
Caption: although don&#39;t give me any ideas

00:27:48.719 --> 00:27:52.859
Caption: for the AI there is also a collection of

00:27:50.579 --> 00:27:55.079
Caption: invisible shapes but these these ones

00:27:52.859 --> 00:27:57.119
Caption: blink at semi-random intervals the

00:27:55.079 --> 00:27:59.038
Caption: difference between this navigation and

00:27:57.119 --> 00:28:01.918
Caption: the previous navigation is that all the

00:27:59.038 --> 00:28:05.599
Caption: shapes are in the same place except only

00:28:01.918 --> 00:28:05.599
Caption: one is visible at a given time

00:28:06.839 --> 00:28:11.939
Caption: when a user clicks on the button labeled

00:28:09.239 --> 00:28:13.798
Caption: click to make AI move I have no ux

00:28:11.939 --> 00:28:16.259
Caption: designer but that&#39;s pretty

00:28:13.798 --> 00:28:18.538
Caption: self-explanatory it instigates the

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.339
Caption: animations of each shape lawet clicking

00:28:18.538 --> 00:28:22.500
Caption: so this is for demonstration in reality

00:28:20.339 --> 00:28:24.658
Caption: those shapes are invisible and they&#39;re

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:28.579
Caption: clicking they&#39;re blinking a lot faster

00:28:24.659 --> 00:28:28.580
Caption: and there&#39;s a lot more of them

00:28:28.979 --> 00:28:32.599
Caption: so that&#39;s it

00:28:30.479 --> 00:28:36.959
Caption: our model consists of

00:28:32.599 --> 00:28:39.239
Caption: 1830 game stats 301 of those each have

00:28:36.959 --> 00:28:40.918
Caption: an AI making a random choice to proceed

00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:44.400
Caption: to the next move

00:28:40.918 --> 00:28:46.739
Caption: now I say random Choice currently we&#39;re

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.239
Caption: set at a ground state for the model

00:28:46.739 --> 00:28:52.678
Caption: and think of ground state as just

00:28:48.239 --> 00:28:54.839
Caption: predicting 50 50 on a coin toss

00:28:52.678 --> 00:28:57.119
Caption: what we want to do is to change from

00:28:54.839 --> 00:29:00.739
Caption: that ground state into a state that is

00:28:57.119 --> 00:29:00.739
Caption: optimized for playing Tic-Tac-Toe

00:29:00.779 --> 00:29:04.380
Caption: how are we going to do that

00:29:02.699 --> 00:29:06.000
Caption: let&#39;s call back to what we learned just

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.099
Caption: a few minutes ago

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.319
Caption: we&#39;re going to use machine learning so

00:29:08.099 --> 00:29:13.558
Caption: we need to define a test

00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:17.219
Caption: a score and a way to punish or award the

00:29:13.558 --> 00:29:19.798
Caption: AI for making bad or good moves

00:29:17.219 --> 00:29:21.599
Caption: so if we do this we can verify that what

00:29:19.798 --> 00:29:25.019
Caption: we&#39;ve indeed created is a machine

00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:28.079
Caption: learning model an AI for in a PowerPoint

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.719
Caption: to play Tic-tac-toe

00:29:28.079 --> 00:29:32.819
Caption: first our test

00:29:29.719 --> 00:29:34.619
Caption: due to the limited time of a lone man&#39;s

00:29:32.819 --> 00:29:37.678
Caption: calendar and the absurd amount of games

00:29:34.619 --> 00:29:40.678
Caption: of tic-tac-toe I said that this test is

00:29:37.678 --> 00:29:42.479
Caption: does the AI win in three moves the

00:29:40.678 --> 00:29:44.939
Caption: converse is true does the AI lose in

00:29:42.479 --> 00:29:48.000
Caption: three moves

00:29:44.939 --> 00:29:50.099
Caption: next our score

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.779
Caption: now the number of winning games is not

00:29:50.099 --> 00:29:54.178
Caption: evenly distributed among the total

00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:55.799
Caption: number of games of tic-tac-toe what I

00:29:54.178 --> 00:29:59.579
Caption: mean by that is there are far more games

00:29:55.798 --> 00:30:01.558
Caption: where neither the player nor the AI win

00:29:59.579 --> 00:30:05.459
Caption: so for this score we&#39;re going to

00:30:01.558 --> 00:30:08.339
Caption: consider three results pass the AI wins

00:30:05.459 --> 00:30:12.599
Caption: neutral neither the player nor the AI

00:30:08.339 --> 00:30:14.760
Caption: wins and three the AI losers

00:30:12.599 --> 00:30:16.380
Caption: passing represents the best possible

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.699
Caption: score that we could get and we want to

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:21.079
Caption: encourage this as much as possible

00:30:17.699 --> 00:30:21.079
Caption: because it happens so few times

00:30:21.359 --> 00:30:26.038
Caption: the failing is a bit more common but we

00:30:24.839 --> 00:30:27.418
Caption: want to discourage this from happening

00:30:26.038 --> 00:30:28.798
Caption: and neutral is pretty much the most

00:30:27.418 --> 00:30:30.058
Caption: common

00:30:28.798 --> 00:30:31.619
Caption: so

00:30:30.058 --> 00:30:33.599
Caption: this translates to how we&#39;re going to

00:30:31.619 --> 00:30:35.760
Caption: punish a reward

00:30:33.599 --> 00:30:38.158
Caption: when an AI passes and it wins in the

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.199
Caption: first three moves we want to give it an

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:42.000
Caption: extra chance so that it will navigate to

00:30:40.199 --> 00:30:44.639
Caption: each slide that leads to a winning move

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.500
Caption: that&#39;s signified by a plus three chance

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.200
Caption: neutral nothing happens we don&#39;t want

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.579
Caption: our AI to just lose all of its chances

00:30:49.199 --> 00:30:53.819
Caption: to navigate

00:30:50.579 --> 00:30:55.739
Caption: fail is we take away the chance to

00:30:53.819 --> 00:30:59.538
Caption: navigate to the particular slide that

00:30:55.739 --> 00:30:59.538
Caption: made it end up in a losing position

00:31:00.178 --> 00:31:03.898
Caption: so

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:06.719
Caption: how are we actually going to do this

00:31:03.899 --> 00:31:09.779
Caption: this is the fun bit this is the reason

00:31:06.719 --> 00:31:12.959
Caption: why we had to have that absurd uh

00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:14.640
Caption: arrangement of shapes blinking and all

00:31:12.959 --> 00:31:16.558
Caption: of them on the slide

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.779
Caption: it&#39;s also why we have to stay save the

00:31:16.558 --> 00:31:22.099
Caption: previous state that we&#39;re in throughout

00:31:18.779 --> 00:31:22.100
Caption: the whole path of the game

00:31:24.719 --> 00:31:30.918
Caption: so I said that each move in the AI state

00:31:27.899 --> 00:31:33.600
Caption: has a

00:31:30.918 --> 00:31:35.339
Caption: absurd amount of blinking shapes now

00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:37.918
Caption: these shapes represent the probability

00:31:35.339 --> 00:31:39.839
Caption: of moving from one state to another

00:31:37.918 --> 00:31:42.658
Caption: in the ground state I&#39;ve initialized it

00:31:39.839 --> 00:31:44.760
Caption: with 10 shapes each to move to each

00:31:42.659 --> 00:31:45.539
Caption: available location than a I can move

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.079
Caption: into

00:31:45.538 --> 00:31:50.819
Caption: in this slide there are 70 7 places that

00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:53.699
Caption: the AI can move to they&#39;re the blank

00:31:50.819 --> 00:31:56.099
Caption: spaces because there&#39;s no symmetry here

00:31:53.699 --> 00:31:59.278
Caption: and because there&#39;s a initialized for

00:31:56.099 --> 00:32:01.260
Caption: the 10 shapes each to navigate to those

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:02.700
Caption: slides there are 70 randomly blinking

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:05.219
Caption: shapes on this slide

00:32:02.699 --> 00:32:06.719
Caption: each one representing a chance to

00:32:05.219 --> 00:32:09.260
Caption: navigate to the state that we&#39;re going

00:32:06.719 --> 00:32:09.260
Caption: to move to

00:32:11.339 --> 00:32:15.298
Caption: so

00:32:12.538 --> 00:32:18.599
Caption: when an AI runs a test if the results

00:32:15.298 --> 00:32:21.298
Caption: were good that is the AI wins in the

00:32:18.599 --> 00:32:24.418
Caption: first three moves then we&#39;ll track the

00:32:21.298 --> 00:32:27.000
Caption: moves it took to get to that state this

00:32:24.418 --> 00:32:29.219
Caption: represents the best possible play that

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.319
Caption: an AI can make somewhere along the line

00:32:29.219 --> 00:32:33.658
Caption: the player has made a mistake and the AI

00:32:31.319 --> 00:32:35.519
Caption: has a chance to win and it does

00:32:33.659 --> 00:32:36.539
Caption: we want to reward this as much as

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.580
Caption: possible

00:32:36.538 --> 00:32:40.259
Caption: what I mean by that is we want to reward

00:32:38.579 --> 00:32:41.519
Caption: every state that came before it to

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.779
Caption: appear again

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.880
Caption: so

00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:48.240
Caption: we add more of those shapes that are

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.319
Caption: randomly blinking the hyperlink to those

00:32:48.239 --> 00:32:51.178
Caption: slides

00:32:49.319 --> 00:32:53.639
Caption: and we back propagate through every

00:32:51.178 --> 00:32:56.819
Caption: state with that so it starts with no

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.619
Caption: things no pieces on the board

00:32:56.819 --> 00:33:00.058
Caption: when we click the AR moves we want to

00:32:58.619 --> 00:33:03.500
Caption: encourage it then to move to the next

00:33:00.058 --> 00:33:03.500
Caption: state in which it will win

00:33:03.839 --> 00:33:09.178
Caption: however

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:10.739
Caption: let&#39;s say the AI makes a bad play

00:33:09.178 --> 00:33:13.018
Caption: somewhere along the line it might have

00:33:10.739 --> 00:33:14.699
Caption: even had a chance to win

00:33:13.019 --> 00:33:17.220
Caption: but then it doesn&#39;t it makes some sort

00:33:14.699 --> 00:33:19.678
Caption: of fatal error and leaves it open for

00:33:17.219 --> 00:33:21.119
Caption: the player to come in and attack

00:33:19.678 --> 00:33:23.579
Caption: we want to discourage this from

00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:26.219
Caption: happening if it&#39;s in a position where it

00:33:23.579 --> 00:33:28.380
Caption: can either win or Draw

00:33:26.219 --> 00:33:30.658
Caption: we don&#39;t want it then navigating to a

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:32.819
Caption: slide which represents a state that a

00:33:30.659 --> 00:33:36.600
Caption: player can then win

00:33:32.819 --> 00:33:39.178
Caption: so every time we run a test and it loses

00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:41.579
Caption: we back propagate through every slide

00:33:39.178 --> 00:33:44.398
Caption: that we have and take away one of those

00:33:41.579 --> 00:33:45.599
Caption: shapes that navigates to the slide that

00:33:44.399 --> 00:33:47.519
Caption: ends up losing

00:33:45.599 --> 00:33:49.199
Caption: and that&#39;s for every single slide along

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:51.299
Caption: the path

00:33:49.199 --> 00:33:53.339
Caption: this way when it&#39;s at a fork in the road

00:33:51.298 --> 00:33:55.319
Caption: when it doesn&#39;t know where to put it

00:33:53.339 --> 00:33:59.579
Caption: there is more chance that it will move

00:33:55.319 --> 00:34:01.018
Caption: to a slide that wins or is neutral but

00:33:59.579 --> 00:34:04.140
Caption: there is less chance that it&#39;s going to

00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:06.539
Caption: navigate to a slide that loses

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:09.118
Caption: if the test is neutral that is neither

00:34:06.538 --> 00:34:11.598
Caption: the player nor the AI win we simply just

00:34:09.118 --> 00:34:11.598
Caption: do nothing

00:34:13.138 --> 00:34:17.819
Caption: so this is an AI That&#39;s initialized with

00:34:16.138 --> 00:34:19.979
Caption: random choices but you&#39;ll be able to see

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.780
Caption: as we go forward how it works

00:34:19.979 --> 00:34:23.878
Caption: the player is just put in the center and

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.739
Caption: we click again to make the AI move

00:34:23.878 --> 00:34:27.898
Caption: in this case the randomly blinking

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:29.520
Caption: shapes promoted us to navigate to a

00:34:27.898 --> 00:34:31.618
Caption: slide there

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.898
Caption: now a player made a mistake there the AI

00:34:31.618 --> 00:34:35.819
Caption: has a chance to win here an optimized

00:34:33.898 --> 00:34:37.260
Caption: model would put it on the top

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:40.320
Caption: but because there&#39;s an equal chance

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:42.359
Caption: currently for the AI to click onto the

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.520
Caption: navigate to the wrong slide it doesn&#39;t

00:34:42.358 --> 00:34:46.319
Caption: it makes a mistake we&#39;re going to

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.300
Caption: discourage this from happening by

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.619
Caption: navigating back through every slide and

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.479
Caption: taking away one of those randomly

00:34:49.618 --> 00:34:53.219
Caption: blinking shapes so that if it&#39;s ever in

00:34:51.479 --> 00:34:56.878
Caption: the same position again it has less

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:58.739
Caption: chance to navigate to that losing slide

00:34:56.878 --> 00:35:00.239
Caption: and then

00:34:58.739 --> 00:35:01.858
Caption: we do it again

00:35:00.239 --> 00:35:03.060
Caption: the AI will make a move in the top left

00:35:01.858 --> 00:35:05.539
Caption: hand corner and the player will make

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.540
Caption: another move

00:35:05.699 --> 00:35:10.020
Caption: this time the air made a different move

00:35:07.199 --> 00:35:11.578
Caption: it&#39;s setting itself up right to win but

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:13.500
Caption: a player blocks it

00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:16.339
Caption: player has a chance to win so an

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:19.260
Caption: optimized AI with all the navigation

00:35:16.339 --> 00:35:21.060
Caption: shapes configured correctly we&#39;ll try

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:24.000
Caption: and put it in the bottom but again it

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:26.699
Caption: makes a mistake so moving forward we

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.339
Caption: discourage that by taking away every

00:35:26.699 --> 00:35:31.439
Caption: shape that leads to this state

00:35:29.339 --> 00:35:36.920
Caption: from the PowerPoint deck

00:35:31.439 --> 00:35:36.919
Caption: and this is a long grueling process

00:35:39.118 --> 00:35:42.899
Caption: there is a question that I&#39;m sure a lot

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:45.200
Caption: of you have been asking throughout all

00:35:42.899 --> 00:35:45.199
Caption: of this

00:35:52.858 --> 00:35:56.098
Caption: how many games

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.560
Caption: um

00:35:56.099 --> 00:36:00.480
Caption: to be sure I mean it&#39;s great to say what

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.939
Caption: machine learning is not maybe break the

00:36:00.479 --> 00:36:04.679
Caption: stigma how it can be used but why does

00:36:02.939 --> 00:36:07.139
Caption: the fundamentals of the understanding of

00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:09.659
Caption: machine learning matter besides the fun

00:36:07.139 --> 00:36:11.159
Caption: of knowledge for knowledge&#39;s sake why

00:36:09.659 --> 00:36:13.559
Caption: did I go through this whole process of

00:36:11.159 --> 00:36:15.659
Caption: constructing a way to train a PowerPoint

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.060
Caption: to go through a machine learning

00:36:15.659 --> 00:36:20.639
Caption: algorithm

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:22.320
Caption: what I hope is clear by now is the

00:36:20.639 --> 00:36:24.239
Caption: distinction between traditional control

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:27.359
Caption: logic and the Machine learning approach

00:36:24.239 --> 00:36:30.000
Caption: and that&#39;s all it is an approach

00:36:27.358 --> 00:36:32.759
Caption: the difference suggests a fundamental

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.219
Caption: change in how we conduct analysis build

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.260
Caption: Automation and program

00:36:35.219 --> 00:36:39.780
Caption: any other models we saw predicting a

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.280
Caption: digit based on its Darkness or randomly

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:45.599
Caption: guessing are examples of this

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:47.880
Caption: traditional logic if this then that

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:50.040
Caption: however machine learning if nothing else

00:36:47.879 --> 00:36:51.959
Caption: is a tool that allows us to move past

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.119
Caption: this constrained test

00:36:51.959 --> 00:36:55.919
Caption: it&#39;s not possible to know every then

00:36:54.118 --> 00:36:59.959
Caption: this and it&#39;s certainly too time

00:36:55.919 --> 00:36:59.959
Caption: consuming to label every then that

00:37:00.358 --> 00:37:04.500
Caption: machine learning allows us to tackle

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:06.598
Caption: problems that we couldn&#39;t possibly know

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.280
Caption: how to tackle

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:11.160
Caption: machine learning is not just predicting

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:13.739
Caption: digits or analyzing text sentiment but

00:37:11.159 --> 00:37:16.319
Caption: any process in which we can test score

00:37:13.739 --> 00:37:18.239
Caption: and provide feedback

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.180
Caption: all of the advancements in machine

00:37:18.239 --> 00:37:24.000
Caption: learning the maths the the distributed

00:37:21.179 --> 00:37:27.598
Caption: compute are just ways that we can extend

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:32.179
Caption: this process of creating fancy tests

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:32.180
Caption: scoring it and then running it again

00:37:32.699 --> 00:37:37.560
Caption: in cases like I said the cross-entropy

00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:39.419
Caption: loss which sounds pretty fancy but all

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.339
Caption: it is is a way of getting our list of

00:37:39.419 --> 00:37:43.799
Caption: numbers that we predicted and the list

00:37:41.339 --> 00:37:46.200
Caption: of numbers that we expected and doing a

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.000
Caption: calculating a score that is kind of easy

00:37:46.199 --> 00:37:50.639
Caption: to comprehend

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.919
Caption: sometimes it&#39;s not as easy so the

00:37:50.639 --> 00:37:54.419
Caption: researchers have to go above and beyond

00:37:52.919 --> 00:37:55.799
Caption: to try and think about what they&#39;re even

00:37:54.419 --> 00:37:58.020
Caption: trying to test

00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:01.199
Caption: an example like the audio transcription

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:02.520
Caption: paper that we saw where they were faced

00:38:01.199 --> 00:38:05.098
Caption: with a problem that isn&#39;t immediately

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:07.739
Caption: obvious what we do so they rather than

00:38:05.099 --> 00:38:10.020
Caption: diving into let&#39;s just pump it with more

00:38:07.739 --> 00:38:11.879
Caption: compute power it was let&#39;s take a step

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:14.699
Caption: back and what is it that we&#39;re even

00:38:11.879 --> 00:38:17.179
Caption: trying to test it&#39;s the other Dynamics

00:38:14.699 --> 00:38:17.179
Caption: correct

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:21.060
Caption: in a PowerPoint example

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:24.000
Caption: it&#39;s not

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.500
Caption: how can we somehow make some code in

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.879
Caption: PowerPoint although PowerPoint is true

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.079
Caption: and complete

00:38:26.879 --> 00:38:31.019
Caption: um

00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:33.599
Caption: it&#39;s a way of analyzing what we have to

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:36.479
Caption: work with shapes slides and animations

00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:39.180
Caption: and how can we use those to do the

00:38:36.479 --> 00:38:42.419
Caption: fundamental components of testing

00:38:39.179 --> 00:38:45.300
Caption: scoring and providing feedback

00:38:42.419 --> 00:38:47.399
Caption: by adding and subtracting shapes the

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:50.520
Caption: animation allows us to navigate through

00:38:47.399 --> 00:38:52.500
Caption: States but it simply taking away and

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:54.979
Caption: adding shapes that allows us to provide

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.979
Caption: feedback

00:38:56.099 --> 00:39:00.119
Caption: in the end machine learning Taps into

00:38:58.379 --> 00:39:02.399
Caption: something that we take for granted but

00:39:00.118 --> 00:39:07.039
Caption: applies it in a programmatic way

00:39:02.399 --> 00:39:07.039
Caption: it&#39;s our ability to learn before knowing

00:39:09.719 --> 00:39:12.500
Caption: so thank you

00:39:14.939 --> 00:39:21.540
Caption: on the slides here I have uh some of the

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.900
Caption: resources that I did mention neural

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:26.280
Caption: networks in deep learning is the book

00:39:23.899 --> 00:39:29.159
Caption: All Around the fundamentals of neural

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:30.839
Caption: networks I started using the terms AI

00:39:29.159 --> 00:39:32.699
Caption: Machining a little bit interchangeably

00:39:30.839 --> 00:39:34.739
Caption: but as I mentioned way at the beginning

00:39:32.699 --> 00:39:36.838
Caption: machine learning is just one Avenue that

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:38.159
Caption: allows us to get through Ai and it&#39;s one

00:39:36.839 --> 00:39:39.140
Caption: of the most popular and it&#39;s certainly

00:39:38.159 --> 00:39:41.939
Caption: useful

00:39:39.139 --> 00:39:44.219
Caption: neural networks is another subset of

00:39:41.939 --> 00:39:46.319
Caption: machine learning this particular

00:39:44.219 --> 00:39:48.179
Caption: interest of mine but if anyone&#39;s

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:49.320
Caption: interested in learning more I recommend

00:39:48.179 --> 00:39:51.479
Caption: that book

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.160
Caption: Onsen and Frames dual objective piano

00:39:51.479 --> 00:39:56.399
Caption: transcription is the paper that I maybe

00:39:53.159 --> 00:39:57.899
Caption: flippantly was uh reviewing I want to be

00:39:56.399 --> 00:39:59.219
Caption: clear that the Google lab team and

00:39:57.899 --> 00:40:01.559
Caption: everyone that worked on that the

00:39:59.219 --> 00:40:03.118
Caption: incredible work but it does provide a

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.699
Caption: good example of how in the real world

00:40:03.118 --> 00:40:08.039
Caption: sometimes how we test and how we score

00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:10.260
Caption: isn&#39;t immediately obvious

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.359
Caption: Menace the pile of matchboxes which can

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:15.300
Caption: learn if you want to look at this but

00:40:12.358 --> 00:40:16.979
Caption: done in matchboxes have a go at that but

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.479
Caption: I mean they cheated right they had a

00:40:16.979 --> 00:40:20.159
Caption: whole bunch of people working on this

00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:22.560
Caption: was just me and a PowerPoint

00:40:20.159 --> 00:40:24.199
Caption: which is a lot sadder than now I&#39;m

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.339
Caption: saying it out loud

00:40:24.199 --> 00:40:28.078
Caption: and lastly great impractical ideas

00:40:26.339 --> 00:40:30.599
Caption: computer science PowerPoint programming

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:31.979
Caption: is a hoot it&#39;s a long one but if you

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:34.740
Caption: want to see a turing machine in

00:40:31.979 --> 00:40:37.020
Caption: PowerPoint there&#39;s your go

00:40:34.739 --> 00:40:39.060
Caption: sh if you&#39;re interested in a follow-up

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:41.219
Caption: you can add me on Twitter LinkedIn you

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.420
Caption: can go to the blog site that I

00:40:41.219 --> 00:40:43.078
Caption: occasionally write

00:40:42.419 --> 00:40:44.879
Caption: um

00:40:43.079 --> 00:40:46.680
Caption: I do have a working version of this

00:40:44.879 --> 00:40:48.719
Caption: PowerPoint AI as you saw in the video

00:40:46.679 --> 00:40:51.000
Caption: it&#39;s not yet optimized for playing

00:40:48.719 --> 00:40:53.520
Caption: Tic-Tac-Toe perfectly because it takes

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.099
Caption: many many iterations of running the test

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:58.020
Caption: adding and subtracting the shapes and my

00:40:56.099 --> 00:41:00.839
Caption: friends didn&#39;t find that interesting on

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:01.919
Caption: a Saturday night so um yeah please reach

00:41:00.839 --> 00:41:05.660
Caption: out to me if you&#39;re interested in

00:41:01.919 --> 00:41:05.659
Caption: versing a PowerPoint in tic-tac-toe

00:41:05.879 --> 00:41:09.539
Caption: I lastly want to thank all of the

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:12.119
Caption: sponsors for DDD they&#39;re the people who

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:14.099
Caption: allow us me to stand up here and talk

00:41:12.118 --> 00:41:17.639
Caption: about something that I have no right to

00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:18.839
Caption: be uh talking about a PowerPoint AI

00:41:17.639 --> 00:41:20.699
Caption: um and also thank you to all the

00:41:18.839 --> 00:41:23.460
Caption: volunteers who work up very early today

00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:25.739
Caption: to get this all working

00:41:23.459 --> 00:41:30.139
Caption: thank you

00:41:25.739 --> 00:41:30.139
Caption: I think we have time for some questions

00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:36.479
Caption: practically on time so we&#39;ve got five

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:40.040
Caption: minutes for questions if you wanna yeah

00:41:36.479 --> 00:41:40.040
Caption: I think we&#39;ve got a question there yeah

00:41:40.618 --> 00:41:44.819
Caption: oh thanks so you said machine learning

00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:48.359
Caption: is one of the ways to do AI what are the

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:50.099
Caption: ways yeah AI is like about as broad as

00:41:48.358 --> 00:41:51.779
Caption: term as you can get some people consider

00:41:50.099 --> 00:41:53.640
Caption: things like statistical models and

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:55.800
Caption: everything to be part of AI so that&#39;s

00:41:53.639 --> 00:41:57.000
Caption: not something that users an iterative

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.500
Caption: approach

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.379
Caption: um but you know things like probability

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.879
Caption: tests and t-tests other people uh

00:42:01.379 --> 00:42:04.919
Caption: natural language processing is a really

00:42:02.879 --> 00:42:07.078
Caption: interesting example of AI that isn&#39;t

00:42:04.919 --> 00:42:09.059
Caption: machine learning because there&#39;s a whole

00:42:07.079 --> 00:42:11.579
Caption: bunch of still maths linear algebra and

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:14.280
Caption: stuff but they don&#39;t do the iterative

00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:15.900
Caption: approach they just do like Vector

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.159
Caption: multiplication and stuff like that

00:42:15.899 --> 00:42:20.419
Caption: that&#39;s simplifying it a lot but there

00:42:17.159 --> 00:42:20.419
Caption: are yeah those are some of the examples

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.479
Caption: next question

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.339
Caption: um I was pretty impressed with what

00:42:30.959 --> 00:42:35.879
Caption: we&#39;ve seen today but I just wanted to

00:42:32.339 --> 00:42:37.560
Caption: ask what&#39;s next what&#39;s next next oh well

00:42:35.879 --> 00:42:40.439
Caption: I mean go is one of the most complicated

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.640
Caption: games you can play Maybe

00:42:40.439 --> 00:42:43.379
Caption: no

00:42:41.639 --> 00:42:45.179
Caption: um I don&#39;t know I mean to be honest this

00:42:43.379 --> 00:42:47.098
Caption: is just a fun example maybe I&#39;ve spent

00:42:45.179 --> 00:42:48.800
Caption: too much time on it but it it was more

00:42:47.099 --> 00:42:51.359
Caption: of an exploration into

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.739
Caption: how fundamental machine learning

00:42:51.358 --> 00:42:54.719
Caption: actually is

00:42:52.739 --> 00:42:55.858
Caption: um I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d do something like

00:42:54.719 --> 00:42:59.098
Caption: this again

00:42:55.858 --> 00:43:01.559
Caption: um yeah unless you sat me down in a

00:42:59.099 --> 00:43:03.780
Caption: torture room but um I can&#39;t stress

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.520
Caption: enough how many hours it was to form

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.199
Caption: that board

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.280
Caption: um but yeah I&#39;m always Keen in

00:43:07.199 --> 00:43:10.800
Caption: investigating these sort of weird

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:16.679
Caption: approaches so

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:19.459
Caption: uh anyone else lucky last question guys

00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:19.459
Caption: anybody

00:43:21.659 --> 00:43:27.358
Caption: wonderful oh we&#39;ve got another one you

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:28.859
Caption: know I&#39;ll talk about this for hours oh

00:43:27.358 --> 00:43:30.479
Caption: yeah um yeah I&#39;ll ask some of the

00:43:28.858 --> 00:43:32.939
Caption: questions so I was just curious with the

00:43:30.479 --> 00:43:34.739
Caption: um PowerPoints I never thought of it but

00:43:32.939 --> 00:43:36.060
Caption: um did you say there&#39;s no code you just

00:43:34.739 --> 00:43:37.819
Caption: literally have a PowerPoint that just

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:41.040
Caption: click through it yeah yeah yeah

00:43:37.819 --> 00:43:46.700
Caption: someone was manually doing the um like

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:46.699
Caption: punishment and rewards yeah wow okay

00:43:47.659 --> 00:43:53.338
Caption: yeah yeah like I said there was macros

00:43:50.819 --> 00:43:57.119
Caption: involved to like insert the slides um

00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:58.440
Caption: like I&#39;m not gonna copy and paste 1 830

00:43:57.118 --> 00:44:01.679
Caption: slides

00:43:58.439 --> 00:44:02.818
Caption: um but yeah those those macros weren&#39;t

00:44:01.679 --> 00:44:04.078
Caption: used for the actual training of it

00:44:02.819 --> 00:44:05.520
Caption: because that kind of defeats the purpose

00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:07.979
Caption: this would be

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:09.599
Caption: easy to do it in VBA or something like

00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:11.040
Caption: that but it wouldn&#39;t it defeat the

00:44:09.599 --> 00:44:12.839
Caption: purpose of the whole exercise I think

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.679
Caption: personally I mean maybe I&#39;m just

00:44:12.839 --> 00:44:15.680
Caption: sadistic but yeah

00:44:15.959 --> 00:44:18.500
Caption: thank you so

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.119
Caption: thank you very much

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.579
Caption: that&#39;s it

00:44:30.179 --> 00:44:34.679
Caption: all right guys in here in about 10

00:44:32.579 --> 00:44:38.180
Caption: minutes we&#39;re gonna have George coldham

00:44:34.679 --> 00:44:38.179
Caption: and swen Lee
