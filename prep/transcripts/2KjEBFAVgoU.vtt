WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
Caption: are going to talk a lot about

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:06.960
Caption: different approaches

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:08.960
Caption: what the trade-offs are and far far less

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.960
Caption: about the technology

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.399
Caption: one really common pitfall is just

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.479
Caption: reading the front page of these

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:17.278
Caption: technologies dynamo is another one that

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:18.879
Caption: comes up you go by kafka whatever

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:20.479
Caption: they&#39;re going to pitch to you all these

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:22.239
Caption: great benefits

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:23.920
Caption: and they&#39;re going to say it&#39;s so

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.198
Caption: flexible it&#39;s useful in all of these

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.479
Caption: cases

00:00:25.198 --> 00:00:29.038
Caption: you&#39;re really going to have to dig for

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:30.959
Caption: some of those trade-offs

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:32.718
Caption: if you don&#39;t understand this well if you

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:33.840
Caption: don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.960
Caption: solve

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.238
Caption: you&#39;re going to end up in a bit of hot

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:38.558
Caption: water

00:00:36.238 --> 00:00:40.000
Caption: you&#39;re going to end up with a

00:00:38.558 --> 00:00:43.279
Caption: delayed

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.399
Caption: or incomplete solution

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:46.479
Caption: we haven&#39;t really gone through the

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:48.078
Caption: requirements so who knows what we&#39;re

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.039
Caption: really building

00:00:48.078 --> 00:00:51.519
Caption: if we&#39;ve

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.840
Caption: if we&#39;re going to have a

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.119
Caption: lot of back and forth a product

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.279
Caption: after we&#39;ve

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:58.479
Caption: already done a lot of upfront design

00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:00.078
Caption: there&#39;s going to be delays it&#39;s going to

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.878
Caption: be oh but i thought we were going to

00:01:00.078 --> 00:01:04.878
Caption: build it this way not that way

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.919
Caption: if you don&#39;t talk to product at all

00:01:04.878 --> 00:01:07.599
Caption: they&#39;re going to think you&#39;re building

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:09.118
Caption: one thing and you&#39;re going to have built

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:12.080
Caption: another thing

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.240
Caption: your solution is going to be incomplete

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.560
Caption: it&#39;s also going to be expensive

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:18.639
Caption: you haven&#39;t really done much to

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:20.959
Caption: look at where your data is going look at

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:22.478
Caption: what compute you&#39;re going to need

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:23.759
Caption: so you&#39;re going to end up throwing a lot

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:26.158
Caption: of hardware at it which is going to come

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.479
Caption: in a lot of cost

00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:30.639
Caption: it&#39;s also going to be unreliable

00:01:28.478 --> 00:01:31.839
Caption: we&#39;ve put up design up there

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:33.040
Caption: but

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:35.519
Caption: how much throughput are we actually

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.119
Caption: trying to handle how much load

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:40.239
Caption: do we need does our system need to be

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.360
Caption: able to support

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:43.919
Caption: and of course

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.360
Caption: it&#39;s going to be buggy as well

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:48.319
Caption: especially if you&#39;re going to go with

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.239
Caption: those hot new databases with a lot of

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:53.040
Caption: eventual consistency but we&#39;re going to

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:55.360
Caption: go through that later

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.279
Caption: so the interview is very nice very

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.719
Caption: professional very polite

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:00.399
Caption: she&#39;s gonna

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.319
Caption: let you down gently and just say i don&#39;t

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.919
Caption: have any more questions

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.519
Caption: why should she

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:08.720
Caption: we haven&#39;t really demonstrated our

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:12.000
Caption: ability to explain our decisions so

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.000
Caption: she&#39;s going to save everyone time

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.520
Caption: as i mentioned at the start

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.559
Caption: we&#39;ve made a few different mistakes here

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.360
Caption: but i&#39;m going to take a shot at

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:23.279
Caption: distilling it down into one

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.319
Caption: really

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:28.319
Caption: what i think is a common cause

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.360
Caption: and giving it away a bit early but i

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.080
Caption: really think the mistake is

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.319
Caption: unintentional design

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.360
Caption: what i mean by that is we can get very

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.598
Caption: caught up in applying best practice

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.000
Caption: the best the newest technology the one

00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:45.919
Caption: with the most before purported benefits

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Caption: the problem with that is when we&#39;re

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.720
Caption: asked to explain these decisions why do

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.119
Caption: we pick this and not something else

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.238
Caption: we might not be able to explain that

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.238
Caption: and that&#39;s kind of what i mean by

00:02:54.238 --> 00:02:57.518
Caption: unintentional if it was an intentional

00:02:56.238 --> 00:02:59.759
Caption: design

00:02:57.518 --> 00:03:02.238
Caption: we&#39;d much better be able to say yes this

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:04.158
Caption: is why we chose it

00:03:02.238 --> 00:03:06.319
Caption: what we&#39;ve actually done is really

00:03:04.158 --> 00:03:08.000
Caption: sidestepped thinking about the problem

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.319
Caption: and just gone for a lot of shortcut

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.199
Caption: heuristics right which

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.800
Caption: i think best practices can be sometimes

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.000
Caption: so let&#39;s try this whole process again

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.080
Caption: but this time we&#39;ll do it with a bit

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.279
Caption: more intention

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.279
Caption: so let&#39;s wind back the clock

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.679
Caption: we

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.080
Caption: what is system design and i just copied

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:30.000
Caption: this straight from wikipedia

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.360
Caption: it&#39;s defined at the architecture well

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.199
Caption: we&#39;ve got a diagram so i guess we have

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.080
Caption: an architecture

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:37.919
Caption: we have product design

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.559
Caption: actually no we don&#39;t have product design

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.639
Caption: modules interfaces data we ain&#39;t got

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:45.518
Caption: that we haven&#39;t really talked about it

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:47.679
Caption: we don&#39;t have requirements to start with

00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:49.518
Caption: now the product design part is easy

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:51.359
Caption: we&#39;re just going to blame product we&#39;ll

00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:55.360
Caption: just stonewall them off

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.360
Caption: give our solution and then fall over

00:03:56.238 --> 00:03:59.839
Caption: what we actually want to do

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:02.238
Caption: is really collaborate without with

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:05.518
Caption: product or your interviewer

00:04:02.238 --> 00:04:05.518
Caption: or just your team in general

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.759
Caption: i think

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.479
Caption: this works both ways

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.839
Caption: product may some may simply throw

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.919
Caption: requirements over the wall and not

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:19.839
Caption: really want questions so you can do this

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.079
Caption: one reverse as well you deliver a

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:23.839
Caption: solution and blame engineering

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.680
Caption: if your company&#39;s particularly low on

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:26.880
Caption: funds you can blame each other much as

00:04:25.679 --> 00:04:29.199
Caption: you want while you&#39;re packing all your

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.080
Caption: things into your boxes because

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.080
Caption: we fail to launch

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.320
Caption: so

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.000
Caption: on to the walkthrough

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.679
Caption: how we&#39;re going to get ourselves out of

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.720
Caption: this mess where we&#39;ve thrown together a

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:44.559
Caption: really unintentional design

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.880
Caption: the first place to start

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:49.040
Caption: is function requirements

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.559
Caption: what are we actually trying to build

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.680
Caption: when we have a discussion with products

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.679
Caption: what are we going to talk about

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.720
Caption: we want to have a common understanding

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.240
Caption: of what we&#39;re trying to build

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.079
Caption: so

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:05.759
Caption: running back the clock

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:08.000
Caption: we want to talk about

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.199
Caption: sorry we want to design a social media

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.799
Caption: application

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.320
Caption: where users can share messages with

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:13.759
Caption: their friends

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.440
Caption: so

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.039
Caption: what&#39;s the what are the key features

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.919
Caption: what things do we need to provide so

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.919
Caption: that customers can do that

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.440
Caption: the first thing

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.559
Caption: users do need to be able to post

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.279
Caption: messages

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:37.119
Caption: that&#39;s an important one

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.720
Caption: we also want to make sure that

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:42.559
Caption: people can share

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.559
Caption: these messages with their friends

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.479
Caption: how they&#39;re going to do that is by

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.839
Caption: following each other

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.519
Caption: and we also want to make sure that

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:52.399
Caption: you&#39;ve got a nice feed of what all your

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:55.599
Caption: friends are saying

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:57.359
Caption: i think we can focus on these three

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.279
Caption: what i want to stress is that

00:05:57.359 --> 00:06:02.079
Caption: you don&#39;t have to design every part of

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:04.479
Caption: your application here

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:06.478
Caption: you want to spend most of your time most

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.600
Caption: of your effort looking at

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.519
Caption: areas or features where either your

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.440
Caption: product has a lot of risk around it a

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:14.879
Caption: lot of risk around that feature

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.440
Caption: or where you&#39;re really going to extract

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.080
Caption: a lot of competitive advantage

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.759
Caption: and i think if we get these things right

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:23.918
Caption: at the very least we do actually have a

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.360
Caption: social media platform

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.440
Caption: so what about those things we left by

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:28.959
Caption: the side let&#39;s say authentication for

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.039
Caption: example

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:33.039
Caption: we can talk through that so for

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.639
Caption: authentication there&#39;s a lot of nice

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.000
Caption: patterns for doing this

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.399
Caption: i want to say it&#39;s a largely solved

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.399
Caption: problem

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.839
Caption: i&#39;m going to tell my interview with that

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.519
Caption: they&#39;re going to be okay with it

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:46.799
Caption: and we&#39;re going to move on

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:49.839
Caption: if they&#39;re not okay with of course you

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:49.839
Caption: can have a bit of a chat about it

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.000
Caption: so

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:55.279
Caption: we&#39;ve made some progress here

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.959
Caption: just by refining the functional

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:59.199
Caption: requirements we at least know what we&#39;re

00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:00.479
Caption: going to build what our product is going

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.598
Caption: to look like

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.598
Caption: it&#39;s

00:07:01.598 --> 00:07:04.959
Caption: there&#39;s less risk of your solution being

00:07:03.598 --> 00:07:06.160
Caption: delayed

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:08.799
Caption: or

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.800
Caption: incomplete

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:12.319
Caption: you still have all these other problems

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:16.000
Caption: though how are we going to deliver these

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:17.039
Caption: useless cases to our to our users

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.399
Caption: so we&#39;re going to move on to fun

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:20.559
Caption: non-functional requirements the things

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:22.000
Caption: that aren&#39;t features well we really need

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:23.279
Caption: to think through

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.679
Caption: and i think this is where it gets really

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:25.679
Caption: interesting

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:33.919
Caption: actually i&#39;ll expand a bit more on that

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:37.039
Caption: to be clear these are going to be things

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:39.039
Caption: that our application needs to support

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:40.559
Caption: it just isn&#39;t a feature

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:41.598
Caption: users aren&#39;t going to be too aware of it

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:44.639
Caption: and you&#39;re not going to put it up on

00:07:41.598 --> 00:07:46.720
Caption: your website

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.639
Caption: so

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.239
Caption: throughput

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:52.559
Caption: how much traffic does your site need to

00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:52.559
Caption: handle

00:07:53.359 --> 00:07:56.559
Caption: there&#39;s

00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:59.199
Caption: two major ways this gets split up

00:07:56.559 --> 00:08:00.399
Caption: read throughput so reading against your

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:03.119
Caption: data stores reading against your

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:05.759
Caption: services is usually pretty easy to scale

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:08.079
Caption: and scale horizontally too

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:09.919
Caption: right throughput is a lot tougher and

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:13.039
Caption: comes a lot of trade-offs

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:15.919
Caption: which we&#39;re going to discuss later

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:18.559
Caption: so do we need to go away for a few weeks

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:21.520
Caption: and talk to our data team and really get

00:08:18.559 --> 00:08:23.839
Caption: an exact picture of how much traffic we

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:25.279
Caption: are handling how many users we have or

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:26.799
Caption: we haven&#39;t launched it how many users

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:29.039
Caption: we&#39;re going to have

00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:30.399
Caption: not really we can be pretty rough about

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:32.718
Caption: it we just want to get a rough picture

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:34.640
Caption: of is it a lot of throughput is it a

00:08:32.718 --> 00:08:37.359
Caption: little bit of throughput

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.119
Caption: so we can start with some napkin math

00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:40.398
Caption: a pretty standard prompt for this we can

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:44.640
Caption: just ask hey

00:08:40.398 --> 00:08:44.640
Caption: how many users are we expecting to have

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:48.639
Caption: we&#39;re going to get back a number and

00:08:46.398 --> 00:08:50.000
Caption: this is something collaborate product or

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.600
Caption: if it&#39;s an interviewer they&#39;ll likely

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.838
Caption: just hand it over to you

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:55.838
Caption: let&#39;s just say we have 100 million users

00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:59.599
Caption: from that we can start to build a

00:08:58.159 --> 00:09:01.838
Caption: picture we also need to know what

00:08:59.599 --> 00:09:03.759
Caption: they&#39;re going to do in a day right we

00:09:01.838 --> 00:09:06.398
Caption: want to know what is going to be hitting

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.398
Caption: our services

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:10.880
Caption: so we can kind of go with our gut fear

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.040
Caption: here

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.518
Caption: we&#39;re going to say oh an average user is

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:16.958
Caption: going to post up five messages a day

00:09:15.518 --> 00:09:18.159
Caption: uh they&#39;re going to follow one of their

00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.679
Caption: friends

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:20.479
Caption: and i&#39;m going to doom scroll a little

00:09:19.679 --> 00:09:25.278
Caption: bit

00:09:20.479 --> 00:09:27.359
Caption: i have 20 views per user per day

00:09:25.278 --> 00:09:30.719
Caption: sure

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:33.599
Caption: so we can start to get some rough maths

00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:35.439
Caption: if we have 100 million daily app users

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:38.000
Caption: and we have five messages a day that&#39;s

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.159
Caption: 500 million messages a day or about 6

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.838
Caption: 000 requests a second

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:43.919
Caption: if our users are following one other

00:09:41.838 --> 00:09:48.080
Caption: user a day 100 million

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:50.719
Caption: followers a day 1200 requests a second

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.398
Caption: those are both right ones those are both

00:09:50.719 --> 00:09:55.439
Caption: right throughputs that&#39;s how many write

00:09:52.398 --> 00:09:58.080
Caption: requests we&#39;re going to need to handle

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.159
Caption: look it&#39;s kind of around the mid-range

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.398
Caption: the last one is reads

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:04.398
Caption: we&#39;re going to have to do 2 billion

00:10:02.398 --> 00:10:06.799
Caption: reads a day

00:10:04.398 --> 00:10:06.799
Caption: 20

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.919
Caption: feed

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:11.919
Caption: 20 users requesting their feed every day

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.398
Caption: up per user per day

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:17.599
Caption: so 24 000 requests read requests a

00:10:16.398 --> 00:10:20.479
Caption: second

00:10:17.599 --> 00:10:21.759
Caption: it&#39;s getting up there

00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:23.199
Caption: we&#39;ll make a note of that and we&#39;ll come

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.000
Caption: back to that later that&#39;s going to help

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.000
Caption: guide our design

00:10:27.518 --> 00:10:30.000
Caption: we also need to take stock of

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.958
Caption: availability

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.078
Caption: so availability is our system&#39;s ability

00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:37.760
Caption: to fulfill a functional requirement

00:10:36.078 --> 00:10:39.760
Caption: it needs to succeed within a certain

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.640
Caption: span of time

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:45.278
Caption: why is that important

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.600
Caption: if users on our app try to send a

00:10:45.278 --> 00:10:49.838
Caption: message and they keep getting errors or

00:10:47.599 --> 00:10:52.078
Caption: it takes 30 seconds every time you post

00:10:49.838 --> 00:10:55.838
Caption: a message to get a confirmation it&#39;s

00:10:52.078 --> 00:10:55.838
Caption: going to be a pretty crummy experience

00:10:57.679 --> 00:11:00.640
Caption: again

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.640
Caption: and i&#39;m going to hammer this in so much

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.880
Caption: it&#39;s in collaboration with your product

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.880
Caption: team

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:09.359
Caption: well with with your wider team really

00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:13.359
Caption: we&#39;re going to say

00:11:11.599 --> 00:11:15.039
Caption: our users

00:11:13.359 --> 00:11:17.200
Caption: most of the time

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:19.199
Caption: get a response within half a second when

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.278
Caption: they try to send a message

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.720
Caption: it feels about right again we can kind

00:11:21.278 --> 00:11:24.559
Caption: of use our gut as long as we&#39;re sending

00:11:22.719 --> 00:11:26.719
Caption: these products uh these expectations

00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:28.239
Caption: with product

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:30.719
Caption: we can follow another when we go to

00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:32.398
Caption: click follow on another user it succeeds

00:11:30.719 --> 00:11:34.719
Caption: most of the time within about two

00:11:32.398 --> 00:11:36.398
Caption: seconds

00:11:34.719 --> 00:11:37.199
Caption: it&#39;s done less often and users will kind

00:11:36.398 --> 00:11:38.719
Caption: of

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.720
Caption: just accept it that&#39;s what we think

00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:42.799
Caption: anyway we don&#39;t have to get it perfectly

00:11:40.719 --> 00:11:45.199
Caption: right we can always refine these things

00:11:42.799 --> 00:11:47.440
Caption: to now solution after we launch as long

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.760
Caption: as we&#39;ve set our expectations with

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.919
Caption: product

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.838
Caption: the last one is really important for our

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:56.639
Caption: product

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:59.440
Caption: we want to encourage well it&#39;s

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.519
Caption: engagement right we really want users to

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.838
Caption: get stuck in that loop of just scrolling

00:12:01.518 --> 00:12:05.599
Caption: and reviewing all of their friends posts

00:12:03.838 --> 00:12:07.679
Caption: so that really needs to be really quite

00:12:05.599 --> 00:12:09.679
Caption: reliable and happen pretty quickly you

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:11.440
Caption: don&#39;t want them waiting or if they get

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:14.719
Caption: an error screen

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.720
Caption: they could very well leave right

00:12:18.078 --> 00:12:21.440
Caption: we&#39;ll make a note of that and come back

00:12:19.278 --> 00:12:23.039
Caption: to that later

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.958
Caption: consistency is really interesting one as

00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:28.479
Caption: well consistency deals with guarantees

00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.958
Caption: so

00:12:28.479 --> 00:12:32.799
Caption: what what are the characteristics of our

00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:36.719
Caption: system when we

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:38.799
Caption: write data and read data back from it

00:12:36.719 --> 00:12:41.919
Caption: it&#39;s a whole huge topic all by itself

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:41.919
Caption: that i&#39;m not going to go into

00:12:42.078 --> 00:12:45.039
Caption: but

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:47.679
Caption: we can think we&#39;re going to use two

00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:49.518
Caption: major models to categorize it for today

00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:51.760
Caption: we have strong consistency

00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:54.159
Caption: where all of your accesses are seen in

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.160
Caption: sequence

00:12:54.239 --> 00:12:59.278
Caption: that maybe sounds a bit babbling

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.039
Caption: the important thing is this also means

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:03.200
Caption: when we write data to our stores or

00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:04.719
Caption: right down to our services as soon as we

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.880
Caption: try to read it we&#39;re going to get the

00:13:04.719 --> 00:13:09.439
Caption: latest state back it&#39;s strongly

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.440
Caption: consistent

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:14.239
Caption: on the other end of the scale and i

00:13:12.078 --> 00:13:16.320
Caption: promise we&#39;ll get something for this is

00:13:14.239 --> 00:13:18.398
Caption: eventual consistency

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.679
Caption: so

00:13:18.398 --> 00:13:23.039
Caption: with eventually consistent systems

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:24.239
Caption: you&#39;re going to have all these updates

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:25.919
Caption: coming in

00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:28.000
Caption: but when you go to read

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:30.239
Caption: at any time they might have said yeah

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.760
Caption: we&#39;ve accepted this right we&#39;ve accepted

00:13:30.239 --> 00:13:34.638
Caption: this new data

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.320
Caption: but you might not get the latest data

00:13:34.638 --> 00:13:37.440
Caption: the only guarantee this gives you is

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.600
Caption: that

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.479
Caption: if right stop coming in we&#39;ll eventually

00:13:39.599 --> 00:13:42.479
Caption: get the latest state

00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.880
Caption: let&#39;s take an ordering app for example

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:48.479
Caption: amazon or something

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.919
Caption: when we go and order

00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:51.760
Caption: a new book

00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:53.518
Caption: with a strongly consistent system when

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.518
Caption: we&#39;ve got our order history

00:13:53.518 --> 00:13:56.479
Caption: we&#39;re going to see oh the new book we&#39;ve

00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:59.278
Caption: ordered

00:13:56.479 --> 00:14:00.398
Caption: cool easy

00:13:59.278 --> 00:14:02.638
Caption: if we have

00:14:00.398 --> 00:14:05.359
Caption: an eventually consistent back end what

00:14:02.638 --> 00:14:07.278
Caption: we might see is we purchase a book

00:14:05.359 --> 00:14:09.679
Caption: we go to the order history

00:14:07.278 --> 00:14:11.278
Caption: and there&#39;s nothing there

00:14:09.679 --> 00:14:12.958
Caption: that sounds really bad

00:14:11.278 --> 00:14:16.638
Caption: in that case how can eventual eventual

00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:17.919
Caption: consistency be feasible

00:14:16.638 --> 00:14:19.518
Caption: there&#39;s actually a lot of ways around

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:21.359
Caption: this

00:14:19.518 --> 00:14:22.958
Caption: but most almost all of them will add

00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:24.719
Caption: complexity

00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.880
Caption: or otherwise impact the user flow for

00:14:24.719 --> 00:14:28.559
Caption: example you might just say hey if you

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.119
Caption: bought in the past 15 minutes might not

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:32.398
Caption: show up here

00:14:31.119 --> 00:14:34.000
Caption: you might also just choose to show a

00:14:32.398 --> 00:14:35.359
Caption: spinner or something

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.518
Caption: rather than

00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:39.119
Caption: show a stale state to put the customer

00:14:37.518 --> 00:14:41.518
Caption: at ease

00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:44.239
Caption: either way

00:14:41.518 --> 00:14:45.278
Caption: you&#39;re adding complexity application

00:14:44.239 --> 00:14:46.398
Caption: and

00:14:45.278 --> 00:14:48.239
Caption: i did promise we&#39;ll get something in

00:14:46.398 --> 00:14:50.719
Caption: return

00:14:48.239 --> 00:14:52.799
Caption: with strong consistency we get these

00:14:50.719 --> 00:14:55.679
Caption: nice consistent views

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:58.320
Caption: it&#39;s very easy to use easy to debug easy

00:14:55.679 --> 00:15:00.638
Caption: to reason about easy to write it&#39;s very

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.638
Caption: nice

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:06.559
Caption: one thing we can do

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.440
Caption: with eventually consistent systems is

00:15:06.559 --> 00:15:10.958
Caption: really scale out our rights

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.039
Caption: with a lot of these strongly consistent

00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:14.479
Caption: stores

00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:16.559
Caption: it&#39;s difficult

00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:18.320
Caption: to scale to to scale these rights

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:20.000
Caption: horizontally we can&#39;t really have a

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.919
Caption: cluster of right nodes that&#39;s not how it

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.359
Caption: works

00:15:21.919 --> 00:15:25.760
Caption: instead

00:15:23.359 --> 00:15:26.880
Caption: let&#39;s say we have a big sql server

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.880
Caption: database

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.320
Caption: all we can really do is scale it up and

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.638
Caption: up and up

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.239
Caption: you&#39;re going to hit limits there in what

00:15:32.638 --> 00:15:36.239
Caption: you can

00:15:34.239 --> 00:15:40.198
Caption: actually provide

00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:40.198
Caption: and it&#39;s going to be awfully expensive

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:45.759
Caption: with eventually consistent systems

00:15:44.078 --> 00:15:47.359
Caption: we&#39;re basically accepting hey i don&#39;t

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.759
Caption: mind if this system returns a stale

00:15:47.359 --> 00:15:51.758
Caption: result i&#39;d rather be more available

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:58.320
Caption: this also means

00:15:55.198 --> 00:15:59.838
Caption: we get a lot of

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.518
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of techniques that now

00:15:59.838 --> 00:16:04.000
Caption: become available to us to improve right

00:16:01.518 --> 00:16:04.000
Caption: throughput

00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:11.838
Caption: a lot of those hinge on things like

00:16:08.638 --> 00:16:11.838
Caption: asynchronous replication

00:16:12.479 --> 00:16:16.638
Caption: making sure that we

00:16:14.559 --> 00:16:19.518
Caption: a

00:16:16.638 --> 00:16:21.518
Caption: you know a log of our transactions

00:16:19.518 --> 00:16:22.880
Caption: can be sensibly replicated to all of the

00:16:21.518 --> 00:16:23.838
Caption: other nodes in our cluster which are

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.359
Caption: handling

00:16:23.838 --> 00:16:27.359
Caption: a little slice of our right throughput

00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:30.880
Caption: so that&#39;s consistency why should come

00:16:29.278 --> 00:16:32.479
Caption: back a little bit on that one we go and

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.160
Caption: talk about

00:16:32.479 --> 00:16:37.278
Caption: talk a little bit more about databases

00:16:36.159 --> 00:16:39.039
Caption: so how does that actually matter for

00:16:37.278 --> 00:16:40.479
Caption: application

00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:42.880
Caption: is it okay

00:16:40.479 --> 00:16:45.518
Caption: if a user&#39;s feed doesn&#39;t show a message

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.359
Caption: that they&#39;ve just posted

00:16:45.518 --> 00:16:49.198
Caption: potentially

00:16:47.359 --> 00:16:51.278
Caption: it&#39;s not nice but we know we want to

00:16:49.198 --> 00:16:52.799
Caption: handle quite a bit of throughput here

00:16:51.278 --> 00:16:54.078
Caption: and for interest sake we&#39;re going to say

00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:55.359
Caption: yeah we want to make that eventually

00:16:54.078 --> 00:16:56.958
Caption: consistent

00:16:55.359 --> 00:16:59.518
Caption: we&#39;ll accept a bit of complexity in our

00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.518
Caption: application

00:16:59.838 --> 00:17:04.318
Caption: with follows it&#39;s a bit more hazy

00:17:02.078 --> 00:17:05.838
Caption: if you follow another user do you

00:17:04.318 --> 00:17:08.479
Caption: necessarily expect to see all their

00:17:05.838 --> 00:17:10.318
Caption: messages in your feed right away

00:17:08.479 --> 00:17:12.000
Caption: i think that&#39;s been more of a gray area

00:17:10.318 --> 00:17:13.280
Caption: you could argue that hey

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.958
Caption: if i&#39;m interested in what this person

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.119
Caption: has to say i want to get their messages

00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:19.760
Caption: right now

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:21.599
Caption: but there could also be a case made that

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.119
Caption: we wanted to have that extra performance

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:26.958
Caption: we don&#39;t mind if it takes a little while

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:26.958
Caption: for those friends messages to show up

00:17:28.239 --> 00:17:33.199
Caption: with viewing our feed

00:17:30.479 --> 00:17:35.280
Caption: i&#39;d argue it&#39;s much the other way

00:17:33.199 --> 00:17:36.959
Caption: we can accept if one of your friends

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.479
Caption: posts a new message

00:17:36.959 --> 00:17:40.319
Caption: you&#39;re not gonna see it right away it

00:17:38.479 --> 00:17:42.400
Caption: could be five ten seconds it could be a

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:44.239
Caption: minute

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.359
Caption: again one of those things you really

00:17:44.239 --> 00:17:47.359
Caption: want to

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:48.880
Caption: drive with product as long as your

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:51.439
Caption: expectations are aligned i think we&#39;re

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.440
Caption: in a good place

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.039
Caption: so let&#39;s discuss that with our friend

00:17:58.959 --> 00:18:02.479
Caption: our interviewer is it okay if the feed

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:04.798
Caption: sometimes out of date

00:18:02.479 --> 00:18:07.918
Caption: sure thing andrew is very nice she just

00:18:04.798 --> 00:18:07.918
Caption: says yes to whatever we say

00:18:08.479 --> 00:18:12.079
Caption: the last one here

00:18:09.918 --> 00:18:14.558
Caption: a little bit more routine

00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:16.558
Caption: where is this all this data where is all

00:18:14.558 --> 00:18:18.159
Caption: this user data going to go

00:18:16.558 --> 00:18:20.719
Caption: if we&#39;ve got terabytes and terabytes and

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.720
Caption: terabytes we need a store somewhere we

00:18:20.719 --> 00:18:24.239
Caption: don&#39;t want to go and run out of

00:18:22.719 --> 00:18:26.839
Caption: disk space in our database halfway

00:18:24.239 --> 00:18:29.038
Caption: through or run out on some other

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:31.279
Caption: store another one that we&#39;re not going

00:18:29.038 --> 00:18:33.599
Caption: to go too much into is the durability of

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.280
Caption: your data don&#39;t always assume you need

00:18:33.599 --> 00:18:37.280
Caption: to store all of your data

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.960
Caption: there&#39;s actually many cases where you&#39;re

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.960
Caption: going to receive user data and you&#39;re

00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:42.399
Caption: either going to store it temporarily

00:18:40.959 --> 00:18:44.558
Caption: or you&#39;re gonna store somewhere

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.559
Caption: transient you don&#39;t care if that machine

00:18:44.558 --> 00:18:49.199
Caption: crashes and that data goes away

00:18:46.558 --> 00:18:51.279
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s nice to have

00:18:49.199 --> 00:18:53.519
Caption: so similar to what we did for throughput

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:57.280
Caption: let&#39;s do a little bit of napkin math

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.799
Caption: to see how much data we need to store

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.400
Caption: we&#39;re going to put up a little bit of a

00:18:58.798 --> 00:19:02.719
Caption: simple schema here i hope it&#39;s not too

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.479
Caption: controversial just a unique identifier

00:19:02.719 --> 00:19:06.558
Caption: for the message

00:19:04.479 --> 00:19:08.839
Caption: when it was created we&#39;ll generate that

00:19:06.558 --> 00:19:10.880
Caption: server side

00:19:08.839 --> 00:19:12.880
Caption: message and a little bit of metadata

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.719
Caption: around it a better data give us a bit of

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.319
Caption: flexibility maybe we want to stuff

00:19:14.719 --> 00:19:18.159
Caption: something in there later

00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:20.880
Caption: that&#39;s not the point the point is we&#39;ve

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:23.200
Caption: got about 250 bytes of data here

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.400
Caption: per row

00:19:23.199 --> 00:19:26.319
Caption: we already know

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.400
Caption: we&#39;ve we&#39;ve done that

00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:30.558
Caption: we&#39;ve gone asked how many users we have

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.280
Caption: how many messages we expect users to

00:19:30.558 --> 00:19:33.279
Caption: post each day

00:19:33.439 --> 00:19:37.599
Caption: and i hope my math is right here that

00:19:35.038 --> 00:19:40.079
Caption: should be 125 gigs a day

00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:42.319
Caption: or 40 terabytes a year

00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:44.640
Caption: this does matter

00:19:42.319 --> 00:19:46.159
Caption: i use postgreso raw rod a lot my

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.558
Caption: day-to-day

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.400
Caption: that has a database name of 128

00:19:48.558 --> 00:19:52.319
Caption: terabytes

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.359
Caption: that means within a few years we&#39;re

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:54.959
Caption: going to start

00:19:53.359 --> 00:19:56.640
Caption: to have to either we&#39;re going to have

00:19:54.959 --> 00:19:58.319
Caption: we&#39;re going to have to start deleting

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.479
Caption: data

00:19:58.319 --> 00:20:03.359
Caption: or we can have a look an archiving

00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:03.359
Caption: process up front

00:20:05.199 --> 00:20:08.479
Caption: on the other hand

00:20:06.558 --> 00:20:10.558
Caption: be careful other limits as well

00:20:08.479 --> 00:20:12.798
Caption: we just ran into a problem where one of

00:20:10.558 --> 00:20:14.399
Caption: our tables is standard xc it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:20:12.798 --> 00:20:16.239
Caption: getting really close to its limit

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.400
Caption: process has a limit limit of 32

00:20:16.239 --> 00:20:21.719
Caption: terabytes

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.719
Caption: know your technology

00:20:23.038 --> 00:20:25.199
Caption: so

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.520
Caption: now that we&#39;ve gone through what our app

00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:31.520
Caption: needs to support both from a function

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.679
Caption: and non-functional sense

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.959
Caption: we&#39;re gonna go with something a

00:20:33.678 --> 00:20:38.640
Caption: tiny bit more esoteric

00:20:36.959 --> 00:20:39.918
Caption: is the schema

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.359
Caption: how are we going to send this

00:20:39.918 --> 00:20:43.359
Caption: information around our system

00:20:43.678 --> 00:20:47.439
Caption: we don&#39;t need to talk about it in too

00:20:45.439 --> 00:20:50.719
Caption: much detail just enough for us to reason

00:20:47.439 --> 00:20:52.879
Caption: about the parts of our system

00:20:50.719 --> 00:20:55.119
Caption: remember our three use cases

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.319
Caption: want to better post a message

00:20:55.119 --> 00:21:01.520
Caption: we want to be able to follow other users

00:20:58.319 --> 00:21:01.519
Caption: and we want to be able to view

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:05.199
Caption: other uses feeds

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:06.399
Caption: you can see this is missing a whole

00:21:05.199 --> 00:21:08.079
Caption: bunch of stuff

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.760
Caption: but we&#39;ve got the key points here you

00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:12.399
Caption: want to post a message include your

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.159
Caption: message in our follow user you include

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.000
Caption: the user id

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:17.919
Caption: you want to view the feed you&#39;re going

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.359
Caption: to just send them a request and you&#39;re

00:21:17.918 --> 00:21:21.918
Caption: hopefully going to get back a big list

00:21:19.359 --> 00:21:21.918
Caption: of messages

00:21:23.599 --> 00:21:27.599
Caption: the last part

00:21:26.239 --> 00:21:29.439
Caption: ties it all together but i think it&#39;s

00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:32.079
Caption: actually the probably the least juicy

00:21:29.439 --> 00:21:35.199
Caption: part so if we go back to the very

00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:37.839
Caption: standard looking stack we had before

00:21:35.199 --> 00:21:40.079
Caption: how are we actually going to talk to

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:41.038
Caption: our services from our client

00:21:40.079 --> 00:21:42.399
Caption: i think we

00:21:41.038 --> 00:21:45.038
Caption: what i&#39;ve seen a lot is people are going

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:48.080
Caption: to generally default to rest

00:21:45.038 --> 00:21:48.079
Caption: and that&#39;s what i really want to

00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:52.159
Caption: hammer down on or push back on

00:21:50.479 --> 00:21:54.079
Caption: we don&#39;t want to be in the habit of

00:21:52.159 --> 00:21:55.520
Caption: defaulting to certain technologies and

00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:56.880
Caption: it&#39;s our instinct because we develop

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.760
Caption: expertise with these specific

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:01.280
Caption: technologies same with our database

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.558
Caption: a lot of the time and a lot of time it&#39;s

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.760
Caption: okay

00:22:02.558 --> 00:22:06.000
Caption: but i&#39;d like us to be a bit more

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.440
Caption: intentional about how we design these

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.199
Caption: instances instead of saying we&#39;ll just

00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:13.639
Caption: use sql server because we have that we

00:22:09.199 --> 00:22:13.639
Caption: have that there i know how to use it

00:22:13.918 --> 00:22:17.599
Caption: a quick overview of some of the other

00:22:15.678 --> 00:22:19.599
Caption: things out there that aren&#39;t rest i&#39;m

00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:23.520
Caption: not going to go too much into rest

00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:25.038
Caption: i think most of us are pretty aware of

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.558
Caption: how to use it we use a lot in our

00:22:25.038 --> 00:22:28.000
Caption: day-to-day

00:22:26.558 --> 00:22:30.558
Caption: it&#39;s mature

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.280
Caption: it&#39;s battle tested

00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:35.359
Caption: it caches really nicely too

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.599
Caption: but what about the other stuff

00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:39.839
Caption: should we hop straight to graphql

00:22:37.599 --> 00:22:41.760
Caption: graphql is really cool right we can do a

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:43.359
Caption: declarative query instead of have been

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.640
Caption: beholden to different endpoints we can

00:22:43.359 --> 00:22:49.439
Caption: say hey i just want this data

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.678
Caption: i want to get you know these messages

00:22:49.439 --> 00:22:51.678
Caption: and

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.599
Caption: from these users it&#39;s really nice for

00:22:54.239 --> 00:22:57.918
Caption: the front end teams

00:22:55.599 --> 00:22:59.439
Caption: also cuts a bit cuts down a bit on how

00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:00.558
Caption: much data we need to fetch with your

00:22:59.439 --> 00:23:02.959
Caption: rest endpoints you generally get the

00:23:00.558 --> 00:23:06.319
Caption: whole resource back with graph you&#39;re

00:23:02.959 --> 00:23:06.319
Caption: only going to get what you asked for

00:23:07.038 --> 00:23:09.839
Caption: grpc

00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:14.400
Caption: fancy

00:23:11.678 --> 00:23:16.640
Caption: super fast to deserialize and serialize

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.520
Caption: data because it&#39;s just going to send

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.678
Caption: binary representations over the wire

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.479
Caption: why don&#39;t we just use that instead

00:23:21.678 --> 00:23:23.918
Caption: well

00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:27.119
Caption: browsers don&#39;t have very good support

00:23:23.918 --> 00:23:30.479
Caption: for it so if you want to use it for

00:23:27.119 --> 00:23:32.798
Caption: users to send requests to your server

00:23:30.479 --> 00:23:35.359
Caption: you&#39;re going to need a proxy in between

00:23:32.798 --> 00:23:38.399
Caption: so adding complexity there it is however

00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:40.719
Caption: very very nice to serve the server comes

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.039
Caption: there&#39;s trade-offs with that

00:23:40.719 --> 00:23:44.158
Caption: but if you have massive scale these

00:23:43.038 --> 00:23:45.918
Caption: these are things that are going to save

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:50.360
Caption: you a whole lot of money really going to

00:23:45.918 --> 00:23:50.359
Caption: cut down how much compute you need

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.200
Caption: i promise to talk a little about

00:23:53.839 --> 00:23:57.839
Caption: databases

00:23:55.199 --> 00:23:59.439
Caption: where we&#39;re going to put our data

00:23:57.839 --> 00:24:01.599
Caption: a lot of the time we&#39;re going to default

00:23:59.439 --> 00:24:02.959
Caption: to the one of these right

00:24:01.599 --> 00:24:04.880
Caption: we&#39;re going to default to postgres i

00:24:02.959 --> 00:24:07.439
Caption: love postgres i love sql server i love

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.440
Caption: my sequel

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.320
Caption: these have a few things in common

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.000
Caption: they&#39;ll run off a relational model model

00:24:12.319 --> 00:24:15.199
Caption: and they&#39;re going to generally have one

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.880
Caption: write to node

00:24:15.199 --> 00:24:18.719
Caption: and support for read replicas and i know

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.640
Caption: there&#39;s plugins which let you do

00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:23.439
Caption: may let you do more replication and

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.440
Caption: sharding around that

00:24:24.319 --> 00:24:26.798
Caption: generally

00:24:26.959 --> 00:24:29.918
Caption: i think all of these are going to be

00:24:28.239 --> 00:24:31.520
Caption: strongly consistent they just have that

00:24:29.918 --> 00:24:32.479
Caption: one writer node

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.000
Caption: if

00:24:32.479 --> 00:24:35.918
Caption: it&#39;s in a case where i can&#39;t send you

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.640
Caption: up-to-date data it&#39;s going to fail

00:24:35.918 --> 00:24:40.479
Caption: instead the system will become

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.239
Caption: unavailable and you&#39;re going to get

00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:44.079
Caption: nothing

00:24:42.239 --> 00:24:46.880
Caption: the benefit of this is of course it&#39;s

00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:49.038
Caption: much easier

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.400
Caption: to design your applications you you

00:24:49.038 --> 00:24:52.000
Caption: don&#39;t have to deal with potential

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.359
Caption: consistency

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.239
Caption: which you are going to have to deal with

00:24:53.359 --> 00:24:55.599
Caption: a lot

00:24:54.239 --> 00:24:58.798
Caption: in

00:24:55.599 --> 00:24:58.798
Caption: no sql databases

00:24:59.599 --> 00:25:03.278
Caption: a lot of these will

00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:04.798
Caption: say they provide strongly consistent

00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:06.159
Caption: reads

00:25:04.798 --> 00:25:09.278
Caption: but there&#39;s going to be a lot of

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:09.279
Caption: asterisks around that

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:14.158
Caption: once we release ourselves from that

00:25:11.439 --> 00:25:16.879
Caption: requirement

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:19.039
Caption: to have always up-to-date information

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.279
Caption: like i said before a lot of techno a lot

00:25:19.038 --> 00:25:23.678
Caption: of techniques become available to you to

00:25:21.279 --> 00:25:25.520
Caption: support more availability and more

00:25:23.678 --> 00:25:27.199
Caption: throughput even semantically you&#39;re

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.959
Caption: going to get more availability simply

00:25:27.199 --> 00:25:32.719
Caption: because the system will say it&#39;s fine

00:25:28.959 --> 00:25:35.038
Caption: that i&#39;m out of date here&#39;s your data

00:25:32.719 --> 00:25:36.400
Caption: so that&#39;s that big trade-off

00:25:35.038 --> 00:25:38.239
Caption: are you willing to accept eventual

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.119
Caption: consistency

00:25:38.239 --> 00:25:42.880
Caption: if you&#39;re going to get a lot of

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:44.880
Caption: three-point availability out of it

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.319
Caption: there are ways you&#39;re going to get more

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.239
Caption: complexity in your system in your

00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:51.038
Caption: applications

00:25:48.239 --> 00:25:54.359
Caption: or you&#39;re going to affect the user flow

00:25:51.038 --> 00:25:54.359
Caption: in some way

00:25:56.798 --> 00:26:00.239
Caption: we also want to talk about

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.159
Caption: data flows

00:26:00.239 --> 00:26:05.359
Caption: so how

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:07.200
Caption: data flows through our system

00:26:05.359 --> 00:26:08.798
Caption: now that we&#39;ve got a bit of our schema

00:26:07.199 --> 00:26:11.839
Caption: we can have a think about okay these

00:26:08.798 --> 00:26:11.839
Caption: requests are coming in

00:26:12.159 --> 00:26:17.120
Caption: can we do some pre-computation so that

00:26:14.479 --> 00:26:18.558
Caption: when the user goes to fetch a certain

00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:20.640
Caption: piece of data

00:26:18.558 --> 00:26:21.719
Caption: it&#39;s already there hot in the cache or

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.440
Caption: in a server somewhere

00:26:21.719 --> 00:26:24.798
Caption: [Music]

00:26:23.439 --> 00:26:26.719
Caption: as a little bit of flip side you have

00:26:24.798 --> 00:26:28.479
Caption: caching

00:26:26.719 --> 00:26:30.400
Caption: once you&#39;ve done a bit of work to

00:26:28.479 --> 00:26:32.239
Caption: compute something maybe someone&#39;s feed

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.599
Caption: or something like that

00:26:32.239 --> 00:26:35.199
Caption: why not just save it somewhere so if

00:26:33.599 --> 00:26:36.479
Caption: they ask again for we can bring it back

00:26:35.199 --> 00:26:39.599
Caption: quickly we don&#39;t want to have to do all

00:26:36.479 --> 00:26:42.400
Caption: that work of looking up

00:26:39.599 --> 00:26:43.918
Caption: who you know who are their friends

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.520
Caption: what messages

00:26:43.918 --> 00:26:47.119
Caption: have their friends sent

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.599
Caption: to build that picture every time it&#39;s a

00:26:47.119 --> 00:26:49.599
Caption: lot of work

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.520
Caption: there&#39;s concerns around this as well

00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:56.959
Caption: your caching layer can fail

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.119
Caption: you don&#39;t want your application to come

00:26:56.959 --> 00:27:00.558
Caption: unavailable so there&#39;s complexity here

00:26:59.119 --> 00:27:02.319
Caption: again

00:27:00.558 --> 00:27:06.119
Caption: for performance

00:27:02.319 --> 00:27:06.119
Caption: it&#39;s common theme right

00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:08.240
Caption: so

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:10.158
Caption: i&#39;m actually going to give you something

00:27:08.239 --> 00:27:12.239
Caption: that&#39;s not particularly

00:27:10.159 --> 00:27:13.919
Caption: it&#39;s not a perfect architecture or even

00:27:12.239 --> 00:27:15.439
Caption: a great architecture

00:27:13.918 --> 00:27:16.798
Caption: but it&#39;s something that

00:27:15.439 --> 00:27:18.239
Caption: i can back up

00:27:16.798 --> 00:27:20.079
Caption: is something where if you ask me

00:27:18.239 --> 00:27:21.439
Caption: questions about it i can at least give

00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:22.880
Caption: you some

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:25.119
Caption: amount of explanation about why i&#39;ve

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:28.319
Caption: done things a certain way

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:30.798
Caption: i&#39;ve cut out the static assets part

00:27:28.319 --> 00:27:33.278
Caption: that&#39;s a bit less interesting

00:27:30.798 --> 00:27:35.599
Caption: we&#39;ve got our three main requests

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:38.080
Caption: posting a message

00:27:35.599 --> 00:27:40.079
Caption: following another user

00:27:38.079 --> 00:27:42.399
Caption: and getting a feedback what our friends

00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:42.399
Caption: have said

00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:47.119
Caption: so

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.599
Caption: going back to talking about

00:27:47.119 --> 00:27:50.479
Caption: picking the right technology

00:27:49.599 --> 00:27:54.158
Caption: and

00:27:50.479 --> 00:27:54.158
Caption: i&#39;ll add some caveats into this later

00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:57.520
Caption: we&#39;ve put in a graph db

00:27:56.159 --> 00:28:00.559
Caption: for our

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.640
Caption: so uh for our social graph service

00:28:00.558 --> 00:28:03.599
Caption: we&#39;ve got something optimized to help us

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.119
Caption: get

00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:07.918
Caption: a list of friends

00:28:05.119 --> 00:28:10.000
Caption: for a certain user

00:28:07.918 --> 00:28:11.678
Caption: graph databases are pretty cool they

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.399
Caption: store relationships as a first class

00:28:11.678 --> 00:28:16.319
Caption: thing not the element themselves

00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:19.520
Caption: that means when you&#39;re looking for

00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:21.119
Caption: relationships based off a certain node

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.479
Caption: it&#39;s going to be much faster than doing

00:28:21.119 --> 00:28:24.479
Caption: the same on a relational database

00:28:25.599 --> 00:28:29.439
Caption: a lot of these are eventually consistent

00:28:27.918 --> 00:28:30.798
Caption: but as we said before we&#39;re going to go

00:28:29.439 --> 00:28:32.639
Caption: accept that we&#39;ve discussed that with

00:28:30.798 --> 00:28:34.239
Caption: product it&#39;s it&#39;s okay you&#39;re not going

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.640
Caption: to get your friends latest messages

00:28:34.239 --> 00:28:36.640
Caption: right away

00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:41.199
Caption: similar when we post a message so we can

00:28:39.439 --> 00:28:42.639
Caption: do a bit of pre-computation here we

00:28:41.199 --> 00:28:44.319
Caption: don&#39;t want to lose these messages that

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.479
Caption: would be bad if everyone just you know

00:28:44.319 --> 00:28:48.558
Caption: you posted all these messages and

00:28:46.479 --> 00:28:49.520
Caption: you want to see them later reminisce

00:28:48.558 --> 00:28:51.359
Caption: about what you and your friends have

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.359
Caption: been talking about so we&#39;ll

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:57.359
Caption: put a database up there somewhere

00:28:53.359 --> 00:28:57.359
Caption: it could be postgres it could be

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.159
Caption: they both work

00:29:00.319 --> 00:29:04.959
Caption: but we&#39;re also going to send something

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.719
Caption: to an asynchronous worker a feed updater

00:29:04.959 --> 00:29:10.719
Caption: so when we know that a message has come

00:29:06.719 --> 00:29:12.479
Caption: in we&#39;re going to go up and update

00:29:10.719 --> 00:29:14.479
Caption: your people who are following you we&#39;re

00:29:12.479 --> 00:29:17.359
Caption: going to inject this new message into

00:29:14.479 --> 00:29:17.359
Caption: all of those feeds

00:29:18.319 --> 00:29:21.839
Caption: that means

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:23.600
Caption: if we&#39;ve done a good job keeping our

00:29:21.839 --> 00:29:26.558
Caption: caching layer consistent

00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:28.000
Caption: when requests come in a lot of users

00:29:26.558 --> 00:29:29.918
Caption: especially for the active users you&#39;re

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.760
Caption: going to get your feed right away our

00:29:29.918 --> 00:29:33.199
Caption: servers have can do a whole lot less

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.479
Caption: work in

00:29:33.199 --> 00:29:36.479
Caption: generating users feeds

00:29:38.719 --> 00:29:44.239
Caption: so

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:46.158
Caption: it&#39;s in considering things like that

00:29:44.239 --> 00:29:48.319
Caption: i think we get a lot of value

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:49.440
Caption: you can explain your decisions

00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:53.959
Caption: you&#39;re explaining why you&#39;re using

00:29:49.439 --> 00:29:53.959
Caption: something and not something else

00:29:55.439 --> 00:29:58.719
Caption: you&#39;re picking the right technology

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.399
Caption: there&#39;s next steps there&#39;s things i

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.399
Caption: haven&#39;t covered

00:30:06.839 --> 00:30:10.719
Caption: so moving forward it&#39;s doing a bit

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:12.159
Caption: better than this

00:30:10.719 --> 00:30:14.640
Caption: you want to find ways where you can deal

00:30:12.159 --> 00:30:17.200
Caption: with less data

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.839
Caption: and that&#39;s where we kind of talked about

00:30:17.199 --> 00:30:21.599
Caption: can we pre-compute something

00:30:19.839 --> 00:30:23.439
Caption: can we case something just so we have

00:30:21.599 --> 00:30:25.278
Caption: less

00:30:23.439 --> 00:30:28.959
Caption: data that needs to be computed on the

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:28.960
Caption: fly center here and there

00:30:30.079 --> 00:30:35.199
Caption: picking the right tool

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.479
Caption: so really reasoning about

00:30:35.199 --> 00:30:39.918
Caption: what

00:30:36.479 --> 00:30:42.000
Caption: i&#39;m using this technology because this

00:30:39.918 --> 00:30:43.199
Caption: i know it&#39;s got these cons but that&#39;s

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.640
Caption: okay

00:30:43.199 --> 00:30:46.798
Caption: and we&#39;re all in line with product about

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.799
Caption: that

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:51.840
Caption: i&#39;ve also haven&#39;t talked about

00:30:49.199 --> 00:30:51.839
Caption: some of the more

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.239
Caption: for example

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.880
Caption: shouting it&#39;s going to improve your

00:30:56.239 --> 00:31:00.880
Caption: right throughput but

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.199
Caption: that&#39;s kind of a whole topic in itself

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.880
Caption: there&#39;s more complexity there how are

00:31:03.199 --> 00:31:07.599
Caption: you going to split your data up among

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:10.399
Caption: different shards things like that

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:11.520
Caption: few edge cases as well

00:31:10.399 --> 00:31:13.200
Caption: like

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:17.119
Caption: sorry

00:31:13.199 --> 00:31:18.798
Caption: while our solution works well for

00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:21.279
Caption: cases where users don&#39;t have a lot of

00:31:18.798 --> 00:31:21.278
Caption: followers

00:31:21.678 --> 00:31:25.519
Caption: because that little sync worker is going

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.679
Caption: to go and update people&#39;s feeds

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:30.239
Caption: if we have lady gaga come in with a 30

00:31:27.678 --> 00:31:32.880
Caption: million followers and post a message

00:31:30.239 --> 00:31:34.319
Caption: that&#39;s going to be massive right volume

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:37.039
Caption: these are the kind of edge case that you

00:31:34.319 --> 00:31:37.038
Caption: want to think about

00:31:38.319 --> 00:31:43.278
Caption: there&#39;s a cautionary tale here as well

00:31:41.918 --> 00:31:45.199
Caption: you don&#39;t want to be

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:46.720
Caption: when you&#39;re picking the right tool

00:31:45.199 --> 00:31:48.079
Caption: you also want to think about your team&#39;s

00:31:46.719 --> 00:31:49.599
Caption: skill set

00:31:48.079 --> 00:31:52.558
Caption: there&#39;s

00:31:49.599 --> 00:31:54.880
Caption: not much reason to adapt a technology

00:31:52.558 --> 00:31:56.079
Caption: there&#39;s a few ways you can approach it

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.760
Caption: either

00:31:56.079 --> 00:31:59.439
Caption: you

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.519
Caption: tend to shy away

00:31:59.439 --> 00:32:02.479
Caption: from using a technology

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:03.519
Caption: that

00:32:02.479 --> 00:32:05.119
Caption: your team

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:06.080
Caption: doesn&#39;t know how to use

00:32:05.119 --> 00:32:09.119
Caption: or that you think you&#39;re going to have

00:32:06.079 --> 00:32:09.119
Caption: difficulty hiring for

00:32:09.199 --> 00:32:14.319
Caption: another way and this takes a lot of

00:32:11.119 --> 00:32:16.479
Caption: effort is to drive consensus

00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:18.558
Caption: among your wider engineering team about

00:32:16.479 --> 00:32:21.359
Caption: adopting a technology because it allows

00:32:18.558 --> 00:32:23.760
Caption: us to do x y z and i can&#39;t stress how

00:32:21.359 --> 00:32:25.678
Caption: much effort and how exhausting that can

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.320
Caption: be even in the best run

00:32:25.678 --> 00:32:30.398
Caption: organizations

00:32:28.319 --> 00:32:31.439
Caption: you want to look at procurement as well

00:32:30.399 --> 00:32:32.880
Caption: there&#39;s going to be a lot of people in

00:32:31.439 --> 00:32:34.158
Caption: the company who are going to be

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.039
Caption: pretty unhappy if you&#39;re like i want to

00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:39.279
Caption: grab this technology uh

00:32:37.038 --> 00:32:41.359
Caption: i&#39;m going to grab you know cockroach

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:44.399
Caption: here and i like this from aws and i like

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:46.640
Caption: this from azure and i like this from gcp

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:47.919
Caption: it&#39;s going to be a real headache

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.200
Caption: there&#39;s contracts here that need to be

00:32:47.918 --> 00:32:52.959
Caption: negotiated there&#39;s money

00:32:51.199 --> 00:32:54.839
Caption: it&#39;s a lot work more work than it might

00:32:52.959 --> 00:32:57.439
Caption: appear at first

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:59.599
Caption: thought and there&#39;s always you aren&#39;t

00:32:57.439 --> 00:33:00.558
Caption: going to need it

00:32:59.599 --> 00:33:02.880
Caption: i think

00:33:00.558 --> 00:33:04.479
Caption: we have a natural tendency to want to

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:08.558
Caption: avoid

00:33:04.479 --> 00:33:08.558
Caption: maybe future uncertainty or future risk

00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:12.080
Caption: so

00:33:10.558 --> 00:33:13.359
Caption: we can end up over engineering our

00:33:12.079 --> 00:33:15.439
Caption: systems

00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:18.079
Caption: we&#39;ll put this big eventually consistent

00:33:15.439 --> 00:33:20.479
Caption: system in place

00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:22.479
Caption: and spend a lot more time

00:33:20.479 --> 00:33:24.798
Caption: working around the complexity just that

00:33:22.479 --> 00:33:27.199
Caption: than building out our core system

00:33:24.798 --> 00:33:29.199
Caption: so please please please there&#39;s a lot of

00:33:27.199 --> 00:33:30.880
Caption: you aren&#39;t going to need it

00:33:29.199 --> 00:33:32.479
Caption: you can apply here

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:35.119
Caption: remember what your competitive advantage

00:33:32.479 --> 00:33:37.678
Caption: is and focus on that

00:33:35.119 --> 00:33:39.119
Caption: there generally is time to

00:33:37.678 --> 00:33:42.558
Caption: scale up later do a bit of

00:33:39.119 --> 00:33:42.558
Caption: re-architecturing if you&#39;re doing well

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:48.159
Caption: so with this we&#39;re doing a bit better

00:33:45.519 --> 00:33:50.320
Caption: we&#39;ve maybe adopted grbc for our service

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:52.080
Caption: to service comms

00:33:50.319 --> 00:33:53.678
Caption: we know what sort of report we need to

00:33:52.079 --> 00:33:56.640
Caption: handle and we have a

00:33:53.678 --> 00:33:56.640
Caption: plan in place for it

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.599
Caption: and product isn&#39;t getting any nasty

00:33:58.479 --> 00:34:03.119
Caption: surprises we&#39;ve reasoned about

00:34:01.599 --> 00:34:06.158
Caption: how

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:09.040
Caption: our system is going to perform how it&#39;s

00:34:06.159 --> 00:34:10.479
Caption: going to behave for customers

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.320
Caption: it&#39;s always going to be buggy i don&#39;t

00:34:10.479 --> 00:34:15.118
Caption: think we can solve that one that&#39;s a

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.239
Caption: tale for a different day

00:34:15.118 --> 00:34:17.199
Caption: the point is we&#39;re not trying to

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:19.280
Caption: completely

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:21.439
Caption: avoid failure here we&#39;re just trying to

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.199
Caption: make sure we do our due diligence

00:34:21.439 --> 00:34:25.520
Caption: and we&#39;ve reasoned about our system

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:27.598
Caption: sensibly

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.678
Caption: so

00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:31.839
Caption: the key takeaway is just quickly please

00:34:29.678 --> 00:34:32.959
Caption: please please talk to product ask lots

00:34:31.839 --> 00:34:34.960
Caption: of questions

00:34:32.959 --> 00:34:37.678
Caption: we need to stop this

00:34:34.959 --> 00:34:39.439
Caption: habit i still see of waiting for product

00:34:37.678 --> 00:34:40.560
Caption: to give us our requirements or product

00:34:39.439 --> 00:34:42.319
Caption: just giving the engineering team

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.918
Caption: requirements and not really expecting

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.199
Caption: any questions

00:34:43.918 --> 00:34:47.520
Caption: we can get a lot of value out of just

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:47.520
Caption: talking

00:34:47.839 --> 00:34:52.239
Caption: again design with intent

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.918
Caption: explain why you&#39;ve chosen something

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:55.918
Caption: and why you haven&#39;t chosen something

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.040
Caption: design often

00:35:01.358 --> 00:35:03.919
Caption: you&#39;re going to do this a lot at your

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.679
Caption: workplace

00:35:03.919 --> 00:35:07.598
Caption: if you get into this good habit you&#39;re

00:35:05.679 --> 00:35:09.118
Caption: going to get a lot of very you&#39;re going

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:10.640
Caption: to build a lot of experience assistant

00:35:09.118 --> 00:35:12.319
Caption: design is something that does take a lot

00:35:10.639 --> 00:35:14.959
Caption: of experience but if you get in the

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.160
Caption: habit of thinking about it the right way

00:35:14.959 --> 00:35:18.719
Caption: it&#39;s really going to improve your

00:35:16.159 --> 00:35:20.078
Caption: ability to

00:35:18.719 --> 00:35:23.838
Caption: reason

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:25.599
Caption: design makes sense right practice

00:35:23.839 --> 00:35:27.680
Caption: on the side there&#39;s so much great

00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:30.320
Caption: information about their white papers

00:35:27.679 --> 00:35:32.000
Caption: tech blogs videos go and do your study

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.079
Caption: look at how twitter&#39;s built there&#39;s lots

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.399
Caption: of stuff out there instagram netflix

00:35:34.079 --> 00:35:38.160
Caption: there&#39;s so much free material out there

00:35:36.399 --> 00:35:39.439
Caption: you can kind of run through why they did

00:35:38.159 --> 00:35:41.439
Caption: a certain way

00:35:39.439 --> 00:35:42.838
Caption: and then take a step back and try to

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:45.598
Caption: design it

00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:49.079
Caption: yourself cool

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:49.079
Caption: thank you very much

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.519
Caption: [Applause]

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.639
Caption: follow the recipe i just follow that

00:36:02.719 --> 00:36:06.879
Caption: recipe and innovate

00:36:04.639 --> 00:36:06.879
Caption: yes

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.079
Caption: at the interview itself you just want to

00:36:10.399 --> 00:36:13.199
Caption: follow in a structured way and this was

00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:15.839
Caption: actually

00:36:13.199 --> 00:36:17.358
Caption: something that

00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:18.960
Caption: we

00:36:17.358 --> 00:36:20.319
Caption: really agreed

00:36:18.959 --> 00:36:22.078
Caption: wasn&#39;t really not structured way of

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.839
Caption: doing it non-functional requirements

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:25.040
Caption: function requirements

00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:26.480
Caption: like how much

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.560
Caption: how much traffic your servers are going

00:36:26.479 --> 00:36:30.159
Caption: to need to handle schema

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.599
Caption: stuff like that you just want to be able

00:36:30.159 --> 00:36:32.959
Caption: to explain these things and it&#39;s so

00:36:31.599 --> 00:36:34.720
Caption: important when you&#39;re talking to

00:36:32.959 --> 00:36:36.639
Caption: stakeholders or senior engineering

00:36:34.719 --> 00:36:39.199
Caption: leadership as well so i can use that

00:36:36.639 --> 00:36:41.439
Caption: throughout my working life really

00:36:39.199 --> 00:36:44.000
Caption: absolutely perfect okay so i&#39;m going to

00:36:41.439 --> 00:36:47.520
Caption: open up the floor for a q a session uh

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.800
Caption: does anyone have a question for nick

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.800
Caption: okay this man over here please

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.280
Caption: nick hey

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.079
Caption: working yeah

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.400
Caption: uh well thanks for excellent talk um

00:37:00.079 --> 00:37:04.479
Caption: so you you mentioned you know uh always

00:37:02.399 --> 00:37:06.159
Caption: reason about why you choose one tech

00:37:04.479 --> 00:37:07.598
Caption: over the other and it&#39;s built on an

00:37:06.159 --> 00:37:08.399
Caption: assumption that you know all the tech

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:10.480
Caption: and you

00:37:08.399 --> 00:37:11.919
Caption: pretty much and you know

00:37:10.479 --> 00:37:14.239
Caption: you know what&#39;s out there you know

00:37:11.919 --> 00:37:16.959
Caption: alternatives you know pros and cons

00:37:14.239 --> 00:37:18.879
Caption: what&#39;s like the the best behavior if you

00:37:16.959 --> 00:37:20.719
Caption: deal with some systems that you don&#39;t

00:37:18.879 --> 00:37:24.000
Caption: know much about like i don&#39;t know

00:37:20.719 --> 00:37:25.760
Caption: someone&#39;s told you to design time series

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.520
Caption: heavy application and

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.959
Caption: you don&#39;t have a previous experience so

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.800
Caption: how would you

00:37:28.959 --> 00:37:32.560
Caption: you know operate in this kind of

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.599
Caption: situations yeah that&#39;s a really good

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.359
Caption: question

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:36.640
Caption: if someone approached me and said hey

00:37:35.358 --> 00:37:39.118
Caption: i&#39;d like to build this with a time

00:37:36.639 --> 00:37:41.199
Caption: series database

00:37:39.118 --> 00:37:42.559
Caption: i&#39;d basically say why

00:37:41.199 --> 00:37:44.320
Caption: the first thing you want to ask is what

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.239
Caption: are we trying to solve

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.959
Caption: what do we

00:37:46.239 --> 00:37:50.560
Caption: what is the problem that needs a time

00:37:48.959 --> 00:37:53.199
Caption: series database for example if it&#39;s

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.199
Caption: something like

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.320
Caption: obviously time based right like

00:37:56.239 --> 00:38:00.239
Caption: a lot of your observability metrics

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.640
Caption: something like that

00:38:00.239 --> 00:38:02.639
Caption: then

00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:06.640
Caption: sure it&#39;s not something i&#39;d probably

00:38:05.358 --> 00:38:07.838
Caption: discourage people from trying to deep

00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:09.679
Caption: dive into everything that&#39;s not

00:38:07.839 --> 00:38:11.119
Caption: something you can do

00:38:09.679 --> 00:38:12.559
Caption: instead you want to have awareness of

00:38:11.118 --> 00:38:14.399
Caption: the different classes of database so

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.839
Caption: you&#39;ve got your like you know why column

00:38:14.399 --> 00:38:17.838
Caption: stores like cassandra or your time

00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:19.680
Caption: series database like you mentioned graph

00:38:17.839 --> 00:38:22.239
Caption: databases and so on

00:38:19.679 --> 00:38:23.919
Caption: as long as you have an awareness of it

00:38:22.239 --> 00:38:24.639
Caption: then you could you can go back and say

00:38:23.919 --> 00:38:26.799
Caption: hey

00:38:24.639 --> 00:38:28.319
Caption: okay after our discussion looks like the

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.119
Caption: time series database is the right way to

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.959
Caption: go

00:38:29.118 --> 00:38:32.479
Caption: i don&#39;t have much experience on this i&#39;m

00:38:30.959 --> 00:38:34.239
Caption: going to have to do a bit of a deep dive

00:38:32.479 --> 00:38:36.399
Caption: on it and i think that&#39;s that&#39;s a plenty

00:38:34.239 --> 00:38:40.760
Caption: reasonable path forwards

00:38:36.399 --> 00:38:40.760
Caption: does i kind of ask the question yeah

00:38:58.639 --> 00:39:02.000
Caption: interview

00:38:59.919 --> 00:39:03.439
Caption: so what can happen is if you throw a

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.358
Caption: technology you aren&#39;t very confident

00:39:03.439 --> 00:39:06.959
Caption: about it can really fall apart and

00:39:05.358 --> 00:39:09.039
Caption: that&#39;s why stress is so important to

00:39:06.959 --> 00:39:11.118
Caption: learn about the underlying concepts of

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.800
Caption: how these things work instead rather

00:39:11.118 --> 00:39:14.639
Caption: than saying i need to know i need

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.719
Caption: to know sql

00:39:14.639 --> 00:39:19.199
Caption: you want to learn about how these how

00:39:16.719 --> 00:39:20.719
Caption: sql databases operate right so

00:39:19.199 --> 00:39:22.879
Caption: at the lowest level they&#39;ve got these

00:39:20.719 --> 00:39:24.239
Caption: logs that they need to make durable and

00:39:22.879 --> 00:39:26.559
Caption: from that they&#39;ll

00:39:24.239 --> 00:39:29.199
Caption: kind of project some data out of it

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.959
Caption: with eventually consistent systems

00:39:29.199 --> 00:39:33.598
Caption: you&#39;ve got

00:39:30.959 --> 00:39:34.879
Caption: distributive rights

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:36.640
Caption: and there is there&#39;s some work there

00:39:34.879 --> 00:39:38.639
Caption: around gaining consensus around what

00:39:36.639 --> 00:39:40.078
Caption: what data is there that kind of stuff so

00:39:38.639 --> 00:39:42.399
Caption: my best advice

00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:44.320
Caption: is to really focus on the concepts that

00:39:42.399 --> 00:39:46.159
Caption: power these technologies don&#39;t focus on

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:48.560
Caption: the technologies themselves too much if

00:39:46.159 --> 00:39:51.838
Caption: you do this well you can actually look

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:54.400
Caption: at what benefits a new product proposes

00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:56.000
Caption: and say i reckon they did it this way

00:39:54.399 --> 00:39:57.598
Caption: and if you&#39;re getting that right often

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.439
Caption: and if you&#39;re able to say i reckon

00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:00.880
Caption: cockroach does things this way they said

00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:02.159
Caption: they got these secret sauce but i reckon

00:40:00.879 --> 00:40:04.239
Caption: it&#39;s something like this

00:40:02.159 --> 00:40:06.479
Caption: if you can start looking at that level

00:40:04.239 --> 00:40:08.000
Caption: you&#39;re really on the right track i think

00:40:06.479 --> 00:40:10.079
Caption: thank you

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.599
Caption: thank you

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:13.599
Caption: another question yes t

00:40:18.479 --> 00:40:23.358
Caption: you mentioned uh that tip if you have

00:40:20.639 --> 00:40:25.439
Caption: how you go about start that discussion

00:40:23.358 --> 00:40:27.118
Caption: with products how do you actually drive

00:40:25.439 --> 00:40:28.800
Caption: that i think that was a great takeaway

00:40:27.118 --> 00:40:32.639
Caption: for me yeah thank you

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.520
Caption: yeah um so that&#39;s a good question

00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:35.358
Caption: it&#39;s

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.640
Caption: it depends on your organization a lot if

00:40:35.358 --> 00:40:38.719
Caption: it&#39;s a very hierarchical one and you&#39;re

00:40:36.639 --> 00:40:40.559
Caption: just getting tickets over the fence

00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:42.719
Caption: it&#39;s a lot of work to go and

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.079
Caption: breach that gap but

00:40:42.719 --> 00:40:46.560
Caption: i think

00:40:44.079 --> 00:40:46.560
Caption: generally

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.919
Caption: you

00:40:48.159 --> 00:40:51.280
Caption: just act in good faith for example if

00:40:49.919 --> 00:40:53.280
Caption: you go

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.199
Caption: to a product person to someone who&#39;s a

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.599
Caption: real decision maker and you say hey

00:40:55.199 --> 00:40:59.118
Caption: here&#39;s what i&#39;ve been asked to build

00:40:57.599 --> 00:41:01.200
Caption: i&#39;d like to know what the problems are

00:40:59.118 --> 00:41:02.719
Caption: trying to solve are and really

00:41:01.199 --> 00:41:05.199
Caption: get some consensus on what we&#39;re trying

00:41:02.719 --> 00:41:05.199
Caption: to deliver

00:41:05.358 --> 00:41:09.118
Caption: i think most people will be very open to

00:41:06.879 --> 00:41:10.399
Caption: that i think a lot of

00:41:09.118 --> 00:41:13.039
Caption: non-engineering people would take to

00:41:10.399 --> 00:41:14.639
Caption: that really kindly

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:17.800
Caption: i hope that answers i hope that answers

00:41:14.639 --> 00:41:17.799
Caption: your question

00:41:20.159 --> 00:41:25.760
Caption: okay

00:41:22.239 --> 00:41:27.598
Caption: uh is that last question anymore

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.839
Caption: okay well i&#39;ve got some good news uh

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:33.880
Caption: morning tea is uh served in the foyer

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.119
Caption: as you know our motto is you need a

00:48:53.599 --> 00:48:56.480
Caption: professional bodyguard delivered to your

00:48:55.118 --> 00:48:58.799

00:48:56.479 --> 00:49:01.040

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:03.760
Caption: bodyguard getting delivered nowhere so

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:07.199
Caption: where are we with that uh the app is

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:08.239
Caption: almost ready uh we just need

00:49:07.199 --> 00:49:10.399
Caption: three

00:49:08.239 --> 00:49:12.239
Caption: more days we need it asap

00:49:10.399 --> 00:49:14.239
Caption: okay team what&#39;s the status on the app

00:49:12.239 --> 00:49:16.559
Caption: we&#39;re good to go except our login

00:49:14.239 --> 00:49:18.399
Caption: experience is a disaster

00:49:16.559 --> 00:49:20.319
Caption: we need something to keep our users data

00:49:18.399 --> 00:49:23.039
Caption: private

00:49:20.319 --> 00:49:24.880
Caption: and to keep the hackers out

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:27.119
Caption: and it needs to work flawlessly because

00:49:24.879 --> 00:49:29.358
Caption: because i don&#39;t want to lose one single

00:49:27.118 --> 00:49:31.598

Caption: ultimate key master you know we don&#39;t

00:49:38.239 --> 00:49:41.439
Caption: have that kind of time we need to

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:43.280
Caption: confirm identities with passwords

00:49:41.439 --> 00:49:44.800

Caption: basically today i want to talk about

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:28.080
Caption: how to build a culture of getting your

01:08:26.719 --> 01:08:31.040
Caption: code

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:32.560
Caption: into production quickly safely

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.719
Caption: and

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.679
Caption: reliably

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:39.279
Caption: hey

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:40.239

01:08:39.278 --> 01:08:41.358
Caption: yeah

01:08:40.238 --> 01:08:42.879
Caption: without this

01:08:41.358 --> 01:08:44.318
Caption: without them today you know wouldn&#39;t be

01:08:42.879 --> 01:08:45.600
Caption: possible

01:08:44.318 --> 01:08:47.198
Caption: okay so

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.879
Caption: first i want to start off with a bit of

01:08:47.199 --> 01:08:50.000
Caption: audience participation

01:08:48.879 --> 01:08:51.758
Caption: everyone loves

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.879
Caption: audience participation i&#39;m sure

01:08:51.758 --> 01:08:55.439
Caption: so

01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:55.439
Caption: oh no

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.719
Caption: okay

01:08:58.798 --> 01:09:02.238
Caption: try not to touch okay

01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:04.400
Caption: so

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:06.079
Caption: if everyone could put up their hand if

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:07.758
Caption: your team has deployed something to

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.879
Caption: production this year

01:09:07.758 --> 01:09:11.919
Caption: we&#39;ll start

01:09:08.879 --> 01:09:11.919
Caption: ideally at low bar

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:15.358
Caption: so

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.239
Caption: keep your hand up

01:09:15.358 --> 01:09:17.678
Caption: so

01:09:16.238 --> 01:09:19.358
Caption: keep your hand up if you

01:09:17.679 --> 01:09:20.959
Caption: your team deploys more often than every

01:09:19.358 --> 01:09:25.278
Caption: six months

01:09:20.959 --> 01:09:25.278
Caption: cool all right uh what about every month

01:09:25.358 --> 01:09:30.238
Caption: a few few hands down but still pretty

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.919
Caption: good okay every week do you does your

01:09:30.238 --> 01:09:33.599
Caption: team deploy every week

01:09:31.919 --> 01:09:35.919
Caption: yep few less hands

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:38.879
Caption: what about every day

01:09:35.919 --> 01:09:42.479
Caption: yep much much less hands

01:09:38.879 --> 01:09:42.479
Caption: and what about every commit

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.399
Caption: all right cool there&#39;s there&#39;s a few

01:09:44.879 --> 01:09:50.318
Caption: people uh awesome uh for the rest of you

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:52.959
Caption: it&#39;s definitely possible right

01:09:50.318 --> 01:09:55.279
Caption: uh and today i&#39;m going to show you a few

01:09:52.959 --> 01:09:56.879
Caption: techniques that you can use

01:09:55.279 --> 01:10:00.959
Caption: maybe not necessary to get there but to

01:09:56.879 --> 01:10:00.959
Caption: improve your deployment process okay

01:10:01.279 --> 01:10:05.919
Caption: uh

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:08.080
Caption: i&#39;m dylan watson i love building useful

01:10:05.919 --> 01:10:09.359
Caption: software uh and thinking about better

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.760
Caption: ways to get it into the hands of our

01:10:09.359 --> 01:10:14.399
Caption: users

01:10:11.759 --> 01:10:15.919
Caption: so first of all i&#39;m gonna start off with

01:10:14.399 --> 01:10:19.040
Caption: some guiding principles things to think

01:10:15.919 --> 01:10:22.238
Caption: about in improving your

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:24.319
Caption: path to prod a little case study

01:10:22.238 --> 01:10:26.319
Caption: recent project i&#39;ve been working on

01:10:24.319 --> 01:10:28.718
Caption: and some practical techniques that you

01:10:26.319 --> 01:10:31.198
Caption: can use to

01:10:28.719 --> 01:10:34.239
Caption: move your code into users hands quickly

01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:34.239
Caption: um and safely

01:10:34.399 --> 01:10:37.439
Caption: hopefully there&#39;s time for questions at

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.199
Caption: the end so

01:10:37.439 --> 01:10:41.919
Caption: i am definitely keen to get into some

01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:45.080
Caption: discussion if you guys um have got

01:10:41.919 --> 01:10:45.080
Caption: our thoughts

01:10:45.359 --> 01:10:47.678
Caption: there&#39;s going to be some controversial

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.919
Caption: stuff ahead

01:10:47.679 --> 01:10:52.880
Caption: you won&#39;t agree with everything i&#39;m sure

01:10:49.919 --> 01:10:54.158
Caption: but that&#39;s cool uh as i said we can have

01:10:52.879 --> 01:10:55.359
Caption: a chat afterwards

01:10:54.159 --> 01:10:58.000
Caption: i will be

01:10:55.359 --> 01:10:58.879
Caption: keen to have a discussion

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.959
Caption: so

01:10:58.879 --> 01:11:04.158
Caption: first off deploying safe uh deploying

01:11:00.959 --> 01:11:05.919
Caption: software safely uh it can be hard

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:07.920
Caption: hopefully that isn&#39;t the controversial

01:11:05.919 --> 01:11:10.560
Caption: win

01:11:07.919 --> 01:11:12.718
Caption: i&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all experienced pain

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:15.280
Caption: in deploying software

01:11:12.719 --> 01:11:17.520
Caption: but it doesn&#39;t have to be that way

01:11:15.279 --> 01:11:17.520
Caption: so

01:11:17.919 --> 01:11:23.120
Caption: i&#39;m sure that we&#39;ve all got a time when

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:25.199
Caption: we&#39;ve had a painful deployment to pride

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.719
Caption: maybe a late night or something so i

01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:29.600
Caption: want you to think about what makes

01:11:26.719 --> 01:11:29.600
Caption: deployments hard

01:11:30.399 --> 01:11:33.520
Caption: does does anyone have anything that they

01:11:32.238 --> 01:11:34.799
Caption: think like what what makes the

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:36.959
Caption: deployment hard

01:11:34.799 --> 01:11:40.158
Caption: anyone have any ideas

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:43.839
Caption: feel free to shout out

01:11:40.159 --> 01:11:45.439
Caption: yes late night deployments

01:11:43.839 --> 01:11:47.439
Caption: gotta love them

01:11:45.439 --> 01:11:49.359
Caption: anything else

01:11:47.439 --> 01:11:52.959
Caption: oh testing

01:11:49.359 --> 01:11:54.959
Caption: yes so manu manual testing uh is a huge

01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:58.640
Caption: one for sure yep

01:11:54.959 --> 01:11:58.640
Caption: um any anything else

01:11:58.959 --> 01:12:04.080
Caption: cabs yes okay so approvals and stuff

01:12:00.959 --> 01:12:06.640
Caption: like that um that&#39;s a huge one um so

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:09.919
Caption: things i think about uh might be

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:12.399
Caption: coordination between multiple teams okay

01:12:09.919 --> 01:12:14.000
Caption: getting getting people to align is

01:12:12.399 --> 01:12:16.640
Caption: always really difficult

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.679
Caption: scheduling out of hours deployments i&#39;d

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:21.439
Caption: rather be at home with my family

01:12:19.679 --> 01:12:22.800
Caption: batching weeks and weeks of changes is

01:12:21.439 --> 01:12:23.919
Caption: super scary

01:12:22.799 --> 01:12:25.119
Caption: you have no idea what you&#39;re sending

01:12:23.919 --> 01:12:26.479
Caption: into production

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.719
Caption: okay

01:12:26.479 --> 01:12:31.199
Caption: manual deployment so any any manual

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:33.199
Caption: steps in your process to production

01:12:31.199 --> 01:12:34.880
Caption: really

01:12:33.199 --> 01:12:37.280
Caption: that can make things really scary

01:12:34.879 --> 01:12:38.399
Caption: they&#39;re likely to go wrong

01:12:37.279 --> 01:12:40.959
Caption: you&#39;re going to mess something up no

01:12:38.399 --> 01:12:43.759
Caption: matter how many times you&#39;ve done it

01:12:40.959 --> 01:12:45.359
Caption: and manual testing

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:47.039
Caption: discuss this as well it&#39;s it&#39;s

01:12:45.359 --> 01:12:48.639
Caption: error-prone okay you want everything to

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.479
Caption: be automated in your pipeline as much as

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.080
Caption: possible

01:12:50.479 --> 01:12:53.839
Caption: and once you actually get the thing into

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.520
Caption: production if something goes wrong and

01:12:53.839 --> 01:12:56.560
Caption: you can&#39;t roll back to a safe state

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.319
Caption: easily

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.719
Caption: that&#39;s also really scary right so all

01:12:58.319 --> 01:13:03.040
Caption: these things build up this fear in our

01:13:00.719 --> 01:13:05.520
Caption: deployment process

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:07.919
Caption: hey on the other side of the coin what

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:11.439
Caption: makes deployments easy

01:13:07.919 --> 01:13:11.439
Caption: does anyone have any ideas

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.319
Caption: sorry

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.319
Caption: yes yeah so less less changes going into

01:13:18.319 --> 01:13:22.238
Caption: production right um

01:13:20.319 --> 01:13:24.158
Caption: things like having your code always

01:13:22.238 --> 01:13:25.039
Caption: ready to deploy

01:13:24.159 --> 01:13:26.880
Caption: so

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.560
Caption: you&#39;ve actually made all the you know

01:13:26.879 --> 01:13:30.879
Caption: automated checks before you get to

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.560
Caption: production um before you even merge your

01:13:30.879 --> 01:13:34.158
Caption: code

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:37.040
Caption: no approvals

01:13:34.159 --> 01:13:37.040
Caption: no coordination

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.840
Caption: yes

01:13:38.799 --> 01:13:41.678
Caption: automated

01:13:39.839 --> 01:13:43.599
Caption: everything basically is probably going

01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:47.440
Caption: to be the pattern of this talk

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.719
Caption: but yeah manual steps testing or

01:13:47.439 --> 01:13:49.759
Caption: approvals

01:13:48.719 --> 01:13:51.520
Caption: for sure

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:54.238
Caption: and you want to get to a point where

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:57.040
Caption: your deployments rarely fail

01:13:54.238 --> 01:13:58.079
Caption: but most of that is about

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.879
Caption: is about

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:03.120
Caption: practice and automation

01:14:00.879 --> 01:14:03.120
Caption: uh

01:14:03.199 --> 01:14:07.280
Caption: so how do we do it

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.199
Caption: okay these are the things that i

01:14:07.279 --> 01:14:11.119
Caption: i think are key

01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:12.840
Caption: uh when we&#39;re improving our deployment

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.640
Caption: process

01:14:12.839 --> 01:14:15.839
Caption: so

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.760
Caption: first of all

01:14:15.839 --> 01:14:20.238
Caption: uh we&#39;ll start off with

01:14:17.759 --> 01:14:21.919
Caption: uh i mean my talks release you into

01:14:20.238 --> 01:14:24.718
Caption: devops right so

01:14:21.919 --> 01:14:27.439
Caption: devops is really a mindset a mindset

01:14:24.719 --> 01:14:30.159
Caption: about automating or removing the steps

01:14:27.439 --> 01:14:32.959
Caption: in your process of deploying prod to

01:14:30.159 --> 01:14:34.640
Caption: production and

01:14:32.959 --> 01:14:36.640
Caption: being prepared to fail right so you&#39;re

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.159
Caption: trying things out

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.760
Caption: and

01:14:38.159 --> 01:14:44.080
Caption: experimenting with your deployment

01:14:39.759 --> 01:14:44.079
Caption: process and trying to just improve it

01:14:44.238 --> 01:14:46.799
Caption: uh

01:14:45.359 --> 01:14:48.718
Caption: back to fundamentals basically what

01:14:46.799 --> 01:14:50.479
Caption: we&#39;re trying to do is write code

01:14:48.719 --> 01:14:52.480
Caption: deploy it to production get it into the

01:14:50.479 --> 01:14:55.120
Caption: hands of our users right that&#39;s that&#39;s

01:14:52.479 --> 01:14:57.359
Caption: ultimately what we&#39;re doing here

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:58.800
Caption: so

01:14:57.359 --> 01:15:01.198
Caption: we discussed before

01:14:58.799 --> 01:15:02.959
Caption: uh small number of changes

01:15:01.199 --> 01:15:04.719
Caption: less risk right so the smaller change

01:15:02.959 --> 01:15:06.159
Caption: that you make

01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:08.719
Caption: you might have

01:15:06.159 --> 01:15:12.080
Caption: less risk of that failing but also when

01:15:08.719 --> 01:15:13.920
Caption: it does fail when uh

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:15.679
Caption: you know exactly what broke right you

01:15:13.919 --> 01:15:17.678
Caption: know that one little change you made

01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:21.760
Caption: that was the issue you can roll it back

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:21.760
Caption: fix it okay it&#39;s isolated

01:15:22.159 --> 01:15:25.600
Caption: you should only merge when it&#39;s safe for

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.719
Caption: production

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.760
Caption: so

01:15:26.719 --> 01:15:29.520
Caption: uh

01:15:27.759 --> 01:15:31.678
Caption: this is more of a

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.879
Caption: yeah again this is like a mindset thing

01:15:31.679 --> 01:15:34.719
Caption: uh and

01:15:32.879 --> 01:15:36.959
Caption: in order to check that we&#39;ll we&#39;ll go

01:15:34.719 --> 01:15:39.520
Caption: through the techniques and stuff but we

01:15:36.959 --> 01:15:41.919
Caption: want to merge and have all the automated

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.040
Caption: safety uh and know

01:15:41.919 --> 01:15:44.959
Caption: that

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:46.479
Caption: this thing is as safe as possible to go

01:15:44.959 --> 01:15:48.718
Caption: to production before you even merge that

01:15:46.479 --> 01:15:48.718
Caption: code

01:15:48.959 --> 01:15:52.959
Caption: testing is built into the pipeline okay

01:15:51.279 --> 01:15:53.919
Caption: that&#39;s absolutely critical so automated

01:15:52.959 --> 01:15:56.080
Caption: testing

01:15:53.919 --> 01:15:57.678
Caption: um and there&#39;s you know

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:59.760
Caption: i could do a whole nother talk about the

01:15:57.679 --> 01:16:01.360
Caption: types of testing but testing has to be

01:15:59.759 --> 01:16:05.439
Caption: built into the pipeline

01:16:01.359 --> 01:16:07.839
Caption: uh same with security okay so

01:16:05.439 --> 01:16:09.839
Caption: it&#39;s that&#39;s just another aspect that we

01:16:07.839 --> 01:16:12.560
Caption: have to consider when we&#39;re

01:16:09.839 --> 01:16:14.639
Caption: um so so this is like your you know code

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.560
Caption: code scanning or vulnerability checking

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.159
Caption: all this sort of stuff needs to be

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:21.839
Caption: automated and will stop you from going

01:16:18.159 --> 01:16:21.840
Caption: to production if these things break

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.399
Caption: and lastly once you actually get your

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:27.919
Caption: code into production you need to observe

01:16:26.399 --> 01:16:30.959
Caption: what&#39;s happening right you need to know

01:16:27.919 --> 01:16:32.959
Caption: so this is like your logging so

01:16:30.959 --> 01:16:34.959
Caption: logging or

01:16:32.959 --> 01:16:36.479
Caption: uh metrics and all this sort of stuff

01:16:34.959 --> 01:16:38.000
Caption: you need to know exactly what&#39;s going on

01:16:36.479 --> 01:16:39.679
Caption: in production so that when things do

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.520
Caption: break you can easily

01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:43.199
Caption: track down the issue

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.000
Caption: and that you know that something is

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:47.120
Caption: broken in the first place

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.040
Caption: okay so

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:51.199
Caption: um i just want to chat a little bit

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.640
Caption: about um recent project i&#39;ve been

01:16:51.199 --> 01:16:55.280
Caption: working on uh

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.239
Caption: at bankwest uh

01:16:55.279 --> 01:16:59.839
Caption: so

01:16:56.238 --> 01:17:01.678
Caption: this is a home loan system with

01:16:59.839 --> 01:17:04.639
Caption: uh depending how you cut their numbers

01:17:01.679 --> 01:17:06.000
Caption: about uh 20 different components so apis

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:07.120
Caption: and apps

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.439
Caption: and

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:11.120
Caption: uh around about four teams

01:17:09.439 --> 01:17:13.678
Caption: so

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:16.239
Caption: when we sort of started our

01:17:13.679 --> 01:17:19.520
Caption: devops journey uh we&#39;re making about

01:17:16.238 --> 01:17:21.198
Caption: five deployments per month okay uh

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.560
Caption: which is

01:17:21.199 --> 01:17:24.960
Caption: is still not terrible but there&#39;s

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:26.159
Caption: there&#39;s also a few teams involved there

01:17:24.959 --> 01:17:27.198
Caption: um

01:17:26.159 --> 01:17:29.840
Caption: and

01:17:27.199 --> 01:17:30.719
Caption: we increased to 55 deployments a month

01:17:29.839 --> 01:17:31.919
Caption: at

01:17:30.719 --> 01:17:32.960
Caption: a roundabout

01:17:31.919 --> 01:17:34.479
Caption: so

01:17:32.959 --> 01:17:36.718
Caption: um

01:17:34.479 --> 01:17:38.799
Caption: uh on a global scale that&#39;s that&#39;s not a

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:40.719
Caption: huge amount but it but it made a big

01:17:38.799 --> 01:17:42.399
Caption: difference to us right um that&#39;s the

01:17:40.719 --> 01:17:44.800
Caption: order of magnitude difference

01:17:42.399 --> 01:17:46.000
Caption: um so how

01:17:44.799 --> 01:17:47.759
Caption: how do we do that

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.319
Caption: right

01:17:47.759 --> 01:17:52.959
Caption: we were prepared to fail often

01:17:50.319 --> 01:17:55.279
Caption: okay try things out uh we would have the

01:17:52.959 --> 01:17:56.159
Caption: engineers in control of deployments

01:17:55.279 --> 01:18:00.399
Caption: and

01:17:56.159 --> 01:18:01.679
Caption: our definition of done was in production

01:18:00.399 --> 01:18:04.000
Caption: so

01:18:01.679 --> 01:18:07.199
Caption: yeah so experimenting and failing often

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Caption: we made failure okay and even expected

01:18:07.199 --> 01:18:11.520
Caption: often when we&#39;re trying things out

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.799
Caption: and because of this we tried lots of

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:16.640
Caption: things failure was cheap okay uh but we

01:18:14.799 --> 01:18:18.158
Caption: also had the backing from our managers

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.000
Caption: to push and improve and make these

01:18:18.159 --> 01:18:20.959
Caption: changes and

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.799
Caption: um

01:18:20.959 --> 01:18:24.718
Caption: the expectation is that most of these

01:18:22.799 --> 01:18:29.198
Caption: experience experiments failed but the

01:18:24.719 --> 01:18:29.199
Caption: ones that worked they had a big impact

01:18:29.679 --> 01:18:32.239
Caption: okay

01:18:30.959 --> 01:18:33.679
Caption: another

01:18:32.238 --> 01:18:35.599
Caption: so i think probably the biggest one for

01:18:33.679 --> 01:18:38.159
Caption: me is that the engineers

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.520
Caption: were in control of the deployments so

01:18:38.159 --> 01:18:42.159
Caption: when we started

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:43.760
Caption: uh the people doing deployments uh the

01:18:42.159 --> 01:18:45.360
Caption: ops were

01:18:43.759 --> 01:18:47.839
Caption: a totally different team

01:18:45.359 --> 01:18:49.759
Caption: right they um they sat over there and

01:18:47.839 --> 01:18:50.959
Caption: you would say oh i want i want a

01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:52.238
Caption: deployment please and you&#39;d have to

01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:53.040
Caption: schedule it in

01:18:52.238 --> 01:18:55.119
Caption: and

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:56.879
Caption: uh in order to alleviate a lot of the

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:59.919
Caption: pressure um

01:18:56.879 --> 01:19:01.839
Caption: we we brought that person in so we

01:18:59.919 --> 01:19:02.640
Caption: brought one of those ops people into our

01:19:01.839 --> 01:19:04.399
Caption: team

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:07.520
Caption: okay and that made a huge difference for

01:19:04.399 --> 01:19:09.279
Caption: us um because it meant that

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:11.919
Caption: all the people in the team we had all

01:19:09.279 --> 01:19:14.799
Caption: the all the skills in the team to deploy

01:19:11.919 --> 01:19:17.678
Caption: our code to production

01:19:14.799 --> 01:19:19.599
Caption: from there that person trained the rest

01:19:17.679 --> 01:19:20.640
Caption: of the team and we were able to work

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:24.080
Caption: together

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:25.840
Caption: engineers uh like dev and ops to

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:29.120
Caption: uh essentially

01:19:25.839 --> 01:19:30.560
Caption: automate our pipeline to production

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.360
Caption: uh

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:33.439
Caption: so

01:19:31.359 --> 01:19:34.319
Caption: uh to a point where anyone in the team

01:19:33.439 --> 01:19:37.839
Caption: could

01:19:34.319 --> 01:19:37.839
Caption: you know just click a button

01:19:38.479 --> 01:19:41.439
Caption: so

01:19:39.439 --> 01:19:43.600
Caption: um yeah essentially the

01:19:41.439 --> 01:19:47.439
Caption: what&#39;s pretty common now the the build

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.439
Caption: it um you build it you run it concept

01:19:48.839 --> 01:19:53.759
Caption: and lastly i think the

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.439
Caption: the fact that our definition of done is

01:19:53.759 --> 01:19:57.198
Caption: a production right so you you can&#39;t

01:19:55.439 --> 01:19:59.279
Caption: close the ticket that you&#39;re working on

01:19:57.199 --> 01:20:00.400
Caption: until that thing is in the hands of your

01:19:59.279 --> 01:20:02.000
Caption: users

01:20:00.399 --> 01:20:04.640
Caption: and i think

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.199
Caption: um maybe it&#39;s a maybe it&#39;s a guilt thing

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:09.520
Caption: but um i think that&#39;s a it&#39;s a or even

01:20:07.199 --> 01:20:11.679
Caption: just a visibility thing um

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:13.919
Caption: if if you don&#39;t close that particular

01:20:11.679 --> 01:20:15.199
Caption: task until it&#39;s in production it doesn&#39;t

01:20:13.919 --> 01:20:17.678
Caption: get forgotten about

01:20:15.199 --> 01:20:20.880
Caption: and you know that when things start when

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:22.800
Caption: cards start to you know pile up uh

01:20:20.879 --> 01:20:24.080
Caption: there&#39;s sort of a you can feel it here

01:20:22.799 --> 01:20:25.359
Caption: that like you need to get that into

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.640
Caption: production that&#39;s that&#39;s a whole bunch

01:20:25.359 --> 01:20:28.959
Caption: of features that your users are missing

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.959
Caption: out on

01:20:29.839 --> 01:20:35.359
Caption: okay so

01:20:31.679 --> 01:20:37.280
Caption: now i want to share some techniques

01:20:35.359 --> 01:20:42.000
Caption: i now want to share some techniques

01:20:37.279 --> 01:20:44.158
Caption: that help to deploy regularly and safely

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.159
Caption: so

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:49.199
Caption: first of all

01:20:47.439 --> 01:20:51.919
Caption: we want to separate our deployments and

01:20:49.199 --> 01:20:54.320
Caption: our releases

01:20:51.919 --> 01:20:55.439
Caption: we want to use feature toggles

01:20:54.319 --> 01:20:57.520
Caption: and

01:20:55.439 --> 01:20:59.359
Caption: a little thing called expand rollout

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:01.760
Caption: contract

01:20:59.359 --> 01:21:02.799
Caption: which is a really great technique

01:21:01.759 --> 01:21:04.718
Caption: some of you probably have used it

01:21:02.799 --> 01:21:06.158
Caption: without knowing the name

01:21:04.719 --> 01:21:07.520
Caption: but basically all these things are about

01:21:06.159 --> 01:21:09.920
Caption: taking a

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:12.399
Caption: considered measured approach okay to our

01:21:09.919 --> 01:21:12.399
Caption: deployments

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:18.719
Caption: so yeah deployments and releases so

01:21:17.279 --> 01:21:21.279
Caption: first of all

01:21:18.719 --> 01:21:24.719
Caption: uh more audience participation

01:21:21.279 --> 01:21:26.319
Caption: uh who who dreads deployments

01:21:24.719 --> 01:21:28.719
Caption: i i suspect

01:21:26.319 --> 01:21:30.639
Caption: anyone that deploys more off uh less

01:21:28.719 --> 01:21:32.080
Caption: less often than a month probably is

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.439
Caption: having these thoughts

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.359
Caption: um

01:21:33.439 --> 01:21:37.279
Caption: okay and what about who who dreads

01:21:35.359 --> 01:21:38.718
Caption: releases

01:21:37.279 --> 01:21:40.000
Caption: okay

01:21:38.719 --> 01:21:41.679
Caption: have a little thing

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.879
Caption: now

01:21:41.679 --> 01:21:45.199
Caption: who thinks i asked the same question

01:21:42.879 --> 01:21:45.198
Caption: twice

01:21:46.238 --> 01:21:51.759
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s valid okay um

01:21:48.879 --> 01:21:53.520
Caption: but uh basically i

01:21:51.759 --> 01:21:55.919
Caption: i&#39;m here to basically separate those two

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:58.239
Caption: concepts okay so first of all we&#39;ll

01:21:55.919 --> 01:22:00.238
Caption: start with some some definitions so

01:21:58.238 --> 01:22:01.439
Caption: deployments are basically

01:22:00.238 --> 01:22:03.519
Caption: um

01:22:01.439 --> 01:22:05.759
Caption: in my eyes moving your code into a

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:08.319
Caption: production environment

01:22:05.759 --> 01:22:09.599
Caption: okay ideally there&#39;s zero downtime so

01:22:08.319 --> 01:22:10.560
Caption: you&#39;re using some sort of deployment

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.919
Caption: strategy

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.319
Caption: like

01:22:11.919 --> 01:22:16.158
Caption: green blue deploy or something like that

01:22:14.319 --> 01:22:18.560
Caption: but ultimately there is no there is no

01:22:16.159 --> 01:22:20.479
Caption: downtime in your system

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:22.159
Caption: and it should be a

01:22:20.479 --> 01:22:25.040
Caption: low risk to the business it&#39;s a

01:22:22.159 --> 01:22:26.320
Caption: technical exercise we&#39;re just moving

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:28.719
Caption: some code

01:22:26.319 --> 01:22:30.000
Caption: into a production environment

01:22:28.719 --> 01:22:30.960
Caption: okay

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.719
Caption: and

01:22:30.959 --> 01:22:35.919
Caption: with automation it should happen with

01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:35.920
Caption: minimal human interaction

01:22:36.479 --> 01:22:41.839
Caption: it also shouldn&#39;t be affecting our users

01:22:38.959 --> 01:22:44.319
Caption: um is a is a pretty cool pretty cool

01:22:41.839 --> 01:22:45.759
Caption: pretty critical one um there&#39;s zero time

01:22:44.319 --> 01:22:48.479
Caption: downtime but there shouldn&#39;t really be

01:22:45.759 --> 01:22:51.519
Caption: any impact to our users

01:22:48.479 --> 01:22:52.479
Caption: on a release on the other hand um

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:56.080
Caption: now

01:22:52.479 --> 01:22:57.199
Caption: obviously we had some people that uh

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.719
Caption: uh

01:22:57.199 --> 01:23:00.800
Caption: thought i was asking the same question

01:22:58.719 --> 01:23:02.480
Caption: really deployments and releases that&#39;s

01:23:00.799 --> 01:23:03.599
Caption: like they&#39;re pretty ambiguous terms i

01:23:02.479 --> 01:23:05.279
Caption: think i think release is a pretty

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:07.600
Caption: ambiguous term um it&#39;s used for all

01:23:05.279 --> 01:23:09.359
Caption: sorts of things

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.359
Caption: generally i&#39;ll probably use the word

01:23:09.359 --> 01:23:12.158
Caption: launch right

01:23:11.359 --> 01:23:16.399
Caption: so

01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:18.320
Caption: i&#39;ll go i&#39;ll go through in a sec but

01:23:16.399 --> 01:23:21.839
Caption: a release or a launch is basically about

01:23:18.319 --> 01:23:21.839
Caption: launching new functionality to a user

01:23:21.919 --> 01:23:27.600
Caption: and maybe maybe you&#39;re only launching to

01:23:25.439 --> 01:23:29.520
Caption: some set of users right you&#39;re only

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:31.359
Caption: activating the code for for certain

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:32.239
Caption: users

01:23:31.359 --> 01:23:33.919
Caption: and

01:23:32.238 --> 01:23:36.319
Caption: the fact that we&#39;re separating

01:23:33.919 --> 01:23:38.479
Caption: deployments and releases allows us to

01:23:36.319 --> 01:23:40.799
Caption: premiere prepare time for

01:23:38.479 --> 01:23:42.399
Caption: comms or train our users or let them

01:23:40.799 --> 01:23:46.000
Caption: know that something is something new is

01:23:42.399 --> 01:23:47.600
Caption: coming okay it&#39;s not going to be like a

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.399
Caption: new facebook release and everyone goes

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.719
Caption: oh

01:23:48.399 --> 01:23:52.799
Caption: it&#39;s totally changed okay um we don&#39;t

01:23:50.719 --> 01:23:54.800
Caption: want to end up in that situation

01:23:52.799 --> 01:23:56.319
Caption: um okay so who cares

01:23:54.799 --> 01:23:57.839
Caption: deployments

01:23:56.319 --> 01:23:59.678
Caption: the team should care right the team

01:23:57.839 --> 01:24:00.638
Caption: doing the work is sending that code into

01:23:59.679 --> 01:24:03.280
Caption: production

01:24:00.639 --> 01:24:04.719
Caption: and and they care when things break

01:24:03.279 --> 01:24:06.079
Caption: okay releases

01:24:04.719 --> 01:24:07.760
Caption: we&#39;re trying to

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:09.600
Caption: um we&#39;re trying to give the user new

01:24:07.759 --> 01:24:10.479
Caption: functionality so the user should care

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:13.120
Caption: okay

01:24:10.479 --> 01:24:14.238
Caption: um and i think that

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:16.479
Caption: that&#39;s what we should be thinking about

01:24:14.238 --> 01:24:18.718
Caption: when we&#39;re separating okay so anyway how

01:24:16.479 --> 01:24:21.279
Caption: do we separate these two things

01:24:18.719 --> 01:24:23.490
Caption: basically we&#39;re trying to deploy a bunch

01:24:21.279 --> 01:24:24.799
Caption: of times

01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:25.679
Caption: [Music]

01:24:24.799 --> 01:24:27.119
Caption: and

01:24:25.679 --> 01:24:29.280
Caption: eventually

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.959
Caption: release

01:24:29.279 --> 01:24:32.079
Caption: so

01:24:30.959 --> 01:24:34.080
Caption: okay

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.760
Caption: uh basically

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.639
Caption: uh

01:24:35.759 --> 01:24:37.678
Caption: the

01:24:36.639 --> 01:24:39.439
Caption: there&#39;s a bunch of different ways you

01:24:37.679 --> 01:24:41.440
Caption: can do it but the biggest one um i&#39;m

01:24:39.439 --> 01:24:45.759
Caption: sure a bunch of you will know feature

01:24:41.439 --> 01:24:47.919
Caption: toggles are other way to do this okay

01:24:45.759 --> 01:24:47.919
Caption: so

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.679
Caption: for those unsure this is a feature

01:24:49.839 --> 01:24:54.479
Caption: toggle okay it&#39;s essentially just

01:24:51.679 --> 01:24:55.199
Caption: something wrapping our code um

01:24:54.479 --> 01:24:57.439
Caption: a

01:24:55.199 --> 01:25:00.639
Caption: you know an if block that says if this

01:24:57.439 --> 01:25:01.759
Caption: new feature is on for some specific user

01:25:00.639 --> 01:25:03.439
Caption: um

01:25:01.759 --> 01:25:05.519
Caption: and you know this thing could be tight

01:25:03.439 --> 01:25:07.678
Caption: entirely broken underneath

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:10.799
Caption: ideally it&#39;s not but

01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:14.560
Caption: the the block allows us to test

01:25:10.799 --> 01:25:17.919
Caption: test this out test out this new feature

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.919
Caption: without affecting other users

01:25:18.238 --> 01:25:21.519
Caption: so

01:25:19.199 --> 01:25:24.080
Caption: with feature toggles we can

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:26.239
Caption: deploy our changes

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:28.399
Caption: and they will be inactive okay so they

01:25:26.238 --> 01:25:30.319
Caption: won&#39;t affect our users

01:25:28.399 --> 01:25:31.279
Caption: they can be slowly rolled out to certain

01:25:30.319 --> 01:25:32.479
Caption: users

01:25:31.279 --> 01:25:34.079
Caption: and

01:25:32.479 --> 01:25:36.238
Caption: basically they allow

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:38.800
Caption: features to be merged

01:25:36.238 --> 01:25:40.479
Caption: and you know built out without affecting

01:25:38.799 --> 01:25:42.000
Caption: other teams as well so other teams

01:25:40.479 --> 01:25:43.839
Caption: working in the same on the same

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.120
Caption: component in the same area aren&#39;t

01:25:43.839 --> 01:25:46.080
Caption: affected by

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.959
Caption: your

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.919
Caption: um

01:25:46.959 --> 01:25:51.919
Caption: your work

01:25:47.919 --> 01:25:51.919
Caption: okay your potentially broken new feature

01:25:52.959 --> 01:25:57.919
Caption: the other dark side of this to toggles

01:25:56.238 --> 01:25:59.919
Caption: um some of you might have heard about

01:25:57.919 --> 01:26:02.639
Caption: the

01:25:59.919 --> 01:26:05.279
Caption: night capital recently um

01:26:02.639 --> 01:26:08.880
Caption: that basically didn&#39;t forgot to clean up

01:26:05.279 --> 01:26:11.198
Caption: a particular toggle and they

01:26:08.879 --> 01:26:13.359
Caption: reused the same toggle name and it

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:14.800
Caption: causes cause them to lose millions of

01:26:13.359 --> 01:26:16.879
Caption: dollars so

01:26:14.799 --> 01:26:18.879
Caption: the critical part of using feature

01:26:16.879 --> 01:26:19.678
Caption: toggles is to clean them up afterwards

01:26:18.879 --> 01:26:20.479
Caption: okay

01:26:19.679 --> 01:26:22.479
Caption: so

01:26:20.479 --> 01:26:25.040
Caption: my rule of thumb is

01:26:22.479 --> 01:26:26.238
Caption: uh basically once it&#39;s on

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:28.560
Caption: and you&#39;ve

01:26:26.238 --> 01:26:30.399
Caption: proven that it&#39;s uh

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:31.919
Caption: that it&#39;s not going to break uh you then

01:26:30.399 --> 01:26:33.279
Caption: remove it right

01:26:31.919 --> 01:26:35.520
Caption: it sounds obvious but it&#39;s it&#39;s

01:26:33.279 --> 01:26:36.638
Caption: something that it&#39;s often gets forgotten

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:39.040
Caption: about

01:26:36.639 --> 01:26:41.760
Caption: but once you turn it on you remove it

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:44.799
Caption: okay maybe a week or whatever but you

01:26:41.759 --> 01:26:45.759
Caption: remove it almost straight away

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:47.678
Caption: so

01:26:45.759 --> 01:26:49.919
Caption: in terms of the process

01:26:47.679 --> 01:26:50.880
Caption: we might introduce a new feature with

01:26:49.919 --> 01:26:53.279
Caption: you know

01:26:50.879 --> 01:26:54.959
Caption: if this new feature is on for some

01:26:53.279 --> 01:26:56.879
Caption: internal user

01:26:54.959 --> 01:26:58.238
Caption: so we turn it on for internal users to

01:26:56.879 --> 01:27:00.000
Caption: begin with

01:26:58.238 --> 01:27:01.599
Caption: and

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.799
Caption: we can start building out this feature

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:07.040
Caption: so we add some more new shiny feature

01:27:04.799 --> 01:27:09.599
Caption: maybe a bug fix okay because our users

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:11.359
Caption: have been using it um into our internal

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.040
Caption: users um

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:15.439
Caption: we&#39;ve been you know dog fooding this

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:17.839
Caption: this particular feature and we fixed

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:20.238
Caption: some bugs okay

01:27:17.839 --> 01:27:24.158
Caption: after that we start turning it on for

01:27:20.238 --> 01:27:24.959
Caption: some specific set of customers okay

01:27:24.159 --> 01:27:26.880
Caption: and

01:27:24.959 --> 01:27:28.959
Caption: you know maybe we make a few more bug

01:27:26.879 --> 01:27:30.799
Caption: fixes but we&#39;re only affecting a small

01:27:28.959 --> 01:27:32.000
Caption: subset of users

01:27:30.799 --> 01:27:33.040
Caption: and then finally we turn it on for

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.919
Caption: everyone

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.760
Caption: okay

01:27:33.919 --> 01:27:38.639
Caption: as soon as that happens

01:27:35.759 --> 01:27:40.879
Caption: we remove the code remove the feature uh

01:27:38.639 --> 01:27:45.400
Caption: feature toggle and

01:27:40.879 --> 01:27:45.399
Caption: everyone has the shiny new feature

01:27:46.639 --> 01:27:49.439
Caption: so

01:27:47.839 --> 01:27:51.359
Caption: okay so that&#39;s about introducing new

01:27:49.439 --> 01:27:54.159
Caption: functionality

01:27:51.359 --> 01:27:55.759
Caption: when we want to introduce

01:27:54.159 --> 01:27:58.080
Caption: say

01:27:55.759 --> 01:28:00.959
Caption: a new

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:03.280
Caption: a new field or a new endpoint for our um

01:28:00.959 --> 01:28:05.759
Caption: api we use a technique called expand

01:28:03.279 --> 01:28:08.799
Caption: rollout contract okay this allows us to

01:28:05.759 --> 01:28:08.799
Caption: make um

01:28:10.399 --> 01:28:15.839
Caption: basically breaking changes in a in a

01:28:13.199 --> 01:28:15.840
Caption: considered manner

01:28:16.479 --> 01:28:21.279
Caption: so um yeah expand roll out contract i&#39;ll

01:28:19.359 --> 01:28:23.119
Caption: go through it in a sec so

01:28:21.279 --> 01:28:24.638
Caption: um

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:27.439
Caption: some more code

01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:29.600
Caption: hopefully it&#39;s simple enough

01:28:27.439 --> 01:28:33.198
Caption: but basically we&#39;ve got a user they&#39;ve

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:35.600
Caption: got a name field a surname field

01:28:33.199 --> 01:28:36.560
Caption: and some usage of that field

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.679
Caption: so

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:41.040
Caption: we think well actually the name field

01:28:39.679 --> 01:28:42.800
Caption: really should be

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.679
Caption: first name okay we want to rename this

01:28:42.799 --> 01:28:47.359
Caption: field

01:28:43.679 --> 01:28:51.600
Caption: so the first thing to do is we expand

01:28:47.359 --> 01:28:51.600
Caption: okay so we add our first name field

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.760
Caption: no one really uses it we&#39;ve added the

01:28:54.238 --> 01:28:58.718
Caption: field

01:28:55.759 --> 01:28:58.718
Caption: we deploy that to prod

01:28:58.879 --> 01:29:03.839
Caption: and then we want to start we&#39;ve got this

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:05.520
Caption: new field we want to start using it so

01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:06.879
Caption: we make a change

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.319
Caption: we start everyone starts to use this

01:29:06.879 --> 01:29:11.198
Caption: field okay

01:29:08.319 --> 01:29:12.959
Caption: there might be if it&#39;s an api there

01:29:11.199 --> 01:29:14.880
Caption: might be multiple other apis consuming

01:29:12.959 --> 01:29:17.439
Caption: this particular field okay everyone

01:29:14.879 --> 01:29:20.158
Caption: updates to use this new field

01:29:17.439 --> 01:29:20.159
Caption: we deploy the prod

01:29:20.319 --> 01:29:22.718
Caption: after that

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:24.718
Caption: uh

01:29:22.719 --> 01:29:26.560
Caption: so that&#39;s so that&#39;s rolling out your

01:29:24.719 --> 01:29:28.080
Caption: change right after that you want to

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:31.199
Caption: start to contract

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.959
Caption: so once you&#39;ve proven

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:35.360
Caption: proven that everyone has stopped using

01:29:32.959 --> 01:29:37.919
Caption: that particular field

01:29:35.359 --> 01:29:41.040
Caption: you then contract and you remove the now

01:29:37.919 --> 01:29:41.839
Caption: defunct unused field okay so this is

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.679
Caption: a

01:29:41.839 --> 01:29:46.000
Caption: measured form of deprecating a

01:29:43.679 --> 01:29:48.159
Caption: particular field

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.159
Caption: so we remove our name field that&#39;s no

01:29:48.159 --> 01:29:53.360
Caption: longer used and

01:29:50.159 --> 01:29:56.560
Caption: we go about our lives

01:29:53.359 --> 01:29:59.119
Caption: after deploying right

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:02.080
Caption: so yeah expand role that contract so

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:04.719
Caption: this technique is really useful for

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:07.439
Caption: api changes okay might be fields might

01:30:04.719 --> 01:30:09.199
Caption: be endpoints but it&#39;s also really useful

01:30:07.439 --> 01:30:10.479
Caption: for database changes you can do the same

01:30:09.199 --> 01:30:12.719
Caption: thing

01:30:10.479 --> 01:30:14.399
Caption: and

01:30:12.719 --> 01:30:17.840
Caption: like library changes

01:30:14.399 --> 01:30:21.839
Caption: library changes potentially

01:30:17.839 --> 01:30:21.839
Caption: a bit harder to track down usages but

01:30:21.919 --> 01:30:26.158
Caption: yeah if if you can if you can understand

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:27.839
Caption: your users of your library then this

01:30:26.159 --> 01:30:29.439
Caption: works just perfectly

01:30:27.839 --> 01:30:31.520
Caption: um

01:30:29.439 --> 01:30:34.000
Caption: okay obviously

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:35.839
Caption: always deployed a problem

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.560
Caption: so

01:30:35.839 --> 01:30:42.319
Caption: what given everything now what does an

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.319
Caption: ideal deploy process look like

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:49.840
Caption: so we&#39;ve got

01:30:45.759 --> 01:30:49.839
Caption: automated tests and security scanning

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:54.399
Caption: we&#39;ve got an automated deployment

01:30:53.279 --> 01:30:56.238
Caption: process

01:30:54.399 --> 01:30:58.319
Caption: okay and

01:30:56.238 --> 01:31:00.158
Caption: it&#39;s really quick to roll back

01:30:58.319 --> 01:31:03.839
Caption: and it&#39;s really quick to get back into a

01:31:00.159 --> 01:31:04.719
Caption: safe state when things go wrong

01:31:03.839 --> 01:31:06.879
Caption: our

01:31:04.719 --> 01:31:07.600
Caption: changes are toggled so when we deploy

01:31:06.879 --> 01:31:09.839
Caption: them

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:11.840
Caption: they have no user impact initially until

01:31:09.839 --> 01:31:13.839
Caption: we&#39;re ready okay until our users are

01:31:11.839 --> 01:31:15.839
Caption: ready until we&#39;ve tested that feature

01:31:13.839 --> 01:31:17.599
Caption: and we&#39;re happy

01:31:15.839 --> 01:31:19.678
Caption: and that means that we minimize the

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:21.520
Caption: number of approvals required

01:31:19.679 --> 01:31:23.520
Caption: after you&#39;ve merged your code

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:25.359
Caption: you can have as much process as you want

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:27.839
Caption: before you merge your code as much as

01:31:25.359 --> 01:31:29.439
Caption: you need but ideally after you&#39;ve merged

01:31:27.839 --> 01:31:31.198
Caption: that code you should be ready to go to

01:31:29.439 --> 01:31:33.279
Caption: production

01:31:31.199 --> 01:31:34.719
Caption: and

01:31:33.279 --> 01:31:36.479
Caption: it&#39;s all automated

01:31:34.719 --> 01:31:38.639
Caption: and our changes are backwards compatible

01:31:36.479 --> 01:31:40.560
Caption: okay we&#39;re using expand span rollout

01:31:38.639 --> 01:31:41.360
Caption: contract

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:43.439
Caption: or

01:31:41.359 --> 01:31:45.678
Caption: some feature toggling mechanism

01:31:43.439 --> 01:31:48.080
Caption: and so we minimize the coordination that

01:31:45.679 --> 01:31:50.959
Caption: we need between teams

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:53.280
Caption: because we&#39;re not breaking other people

01:31:50.959 --> 01:31:54.399
Caption: and we&#39;re doing this all the time so

01:31:53.279 --> 01:31:56.319
Caption: it&#39;s proven

01:31:54.399 --> 01:31:59.678
Caption: and our deployments

01:31:56.319 --> 01:32:02.000
Caption: deployment failures are rare um

01:31:59.679 --> 01:32:03.840
Caption: they they happen but we have

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.080
Caption: we have a rollback procedure and

01:32:03.839 --> 01:32:07.279
Caption: everything works smoothly

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:08.800
Caption: okay so

01:32:07.279 --> 01:32:10.879
Caption: deploying at speed

01:32:08.799 --> 01:32:12.879
Caption: is not a leap of faith okay you don&#39;t

01:32:10.879 --> 01:32:16.000
Caption: just throw stuff into production and

01:32:12.879 --> 01:32:17.040
Caption: just cross your fingers and hope right

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Caption: it&#39;s

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:22.159
Caption: having that safety removes the fear

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.839
Caption: okay and that safety

01:32:22.159 --> 01:32:26.560
Caption: allows us to deploy at

01:32:24.839 --> 01:32:28.959
Caption: speed

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:34.879
Caption: that&#39;s it thank you

01:32:28.959 --> 01:32:37.198
Caption: [Applause]

01:32:34.879 --> 01:32:38.560
Caption: um so i think i assume we&#39;ve got heaps

01:32:37.199 --> 01:32:39.440
Caption: of time for questions

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:41.520
Caption: so

01:32:39.439 --> 01:32:43.439
Caption: yeah thank you very much still um now

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:45.279
Caption: i&#39;m going to open up the floor for a q a

01:32:43.439 --> 01:32:47.759
Caption: session uh has anyone got any questions

01:32:45.279 --> 01:32:47.759
Caption: for them

01:32:51.199 --> 01:32:55.400
Caption: oh we just got one down the back first

01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:01.040
Caption: um

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:04.080
Caption: i guess being sort of still new um to

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:05.839
Caption: developing whatever just wondering what

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:07.520
Caption: these type of manual deployment

01:33:05.839 --> 01:33:10.399
Caption: processes kind of look like if they&#39;re

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:12.639
Caption: like that much of a pain

01:33:10.399 --> 01:33:12.638
Caption: um

01:33:12.879 --> 01:33:16.080
Caption: what do manual deployment processes look

01:33:14.639 --> 01:33:18.560
Caption: like um

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.560
Caption: i guess

01:33:18.719 --> 01:33:24.560
Caption: i don&#39;t know it could look it&#39;s

01:33:20.238 --> 01:33:27.279
Caption: different in every every company uh so

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:29.600
Caption: i guess i&#39;m thinking about uh

01:33:27.279 --> 01:33:32.718
Caption: you know maybe the old days where you&#39;re

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:34.080
Caption: ftping your files onto a php server or

01:33:32.719 --> 01:33:35.360
Caption: something and then

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:37.040
Caption: or like

01:33:35.359 --> 01:33:40.080
Caption: manually copying your

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:44.239
Caption: you know war file onto a server that&#39;s

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:46.159
Caption: like a pet server that you keep alive um

01:33:44.238 --> 01:33:48.479
Caption: you know specifically and you don&#39;t you

01:33:46.159 --> 01:33:51.199
Caption: know create new ones all the time you

01:33:48.479 --> 01:33:52.238
Caption: know like it&#39;s not basically

01:33:51.199 --> 01:33:54.719
Caption: um

01:33:52.238 --> 01:33:57.119
Caption: because that machine is uh you know set

01:33:54.719 --> 01:33:58.800
Caption: up by some person um somewhere five

01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:01.040
Caption: years ago that has since left the

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:04.238
Caption: company so you you&#39;re

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:07.839
Caption: you&#39;re looking at you know setting up um

01:34:04.238 --> 01:34:10.718
Caption: vms uh via code and basically all the

01:34:07.839 --> 01:34:12.799
Caption: pieces of infrastructure that you need

01:34:10.719 --> 01:34:15.520
Caption: are set up by a code that&#39;s that&#39;s the

01:34:12.799 --> 01:34:17.839
Caption: automated like way i know that&#39;s sort of

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:19.279
Caption: very vague but it is totally different

01:34:17.839 --> 01:34:21.439
Caption: in every it depends what you&#39;re

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:23.599
Caption: deploying

01:34:21.439 --> 01:34:23.600
Caption: cool

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:26.719
Caption: next question

01:34:31.679 --> 01:34:36.400
Caption: um i guess this depends a lot on

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.560
Caption: we&#39;re talking about client side or

01:34:36.399 --> 01:34:39.919
Caption: so but how do you prove

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:41.600
Caption: that

01:34:39.919 --> 01:34:43.520
Caption: you know your expand contract for

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:45.600
Caption: example how do you prove

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.520
Caption: that say a property

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:50.560
Caption: an external

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:52.479
Caption: api yeah yes yeah so i guess you&#39;re so

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:54.959
Caption: very internal i mean within an

01:34:52.479 --> 01:34:56.879
Caption: organization but so within

01:34:54.959 --> 01:34:58.238
Caption: within an organization

01:34:56.879 --> 01:35:00.560
Caption: it&#39;s uh

01:34:58.238 --> 01:35:02.718
Caption: ideally much easier um

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:04.159
Caption: uh so

01:35:02.719 --> 01:35:05.840
Caption: like there&#39;s there&#39;s plenty of tools out

01:35:04.159 --> 01:35:07.679
Caption: there like um

01:35:05.839 --> 01:35:09.599
Caption: ideally your organization&#39;s got some

01:35:07.679 --> 01:35:12.880
Caption: sort of code repository and everyone can

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:14.479
Caption: see that the usage of that code you know

01:35:12.879 --> 01:35:17.678
Caption: uh you should be able to know the

01:35:14.479 --> 01:35:18.799
Caption: dependencies of each of the systems so

01:35:17.679 --> 01:35:21.920
Caption: um

01:35:18.799 --> 01:35:24.799
Caption: i guess i&#39;m thinking about um like

01:35:21.919 --> 01:35:27.359
Caption: library like client libraries so um

01:35:24.799 --> 01:35:28.959
Caption: so if you&#39;re talking between apis

01:35:27.359 --> 01:35:30.718
Caption: an api might

01:35:28.959 --> 01:35:32.159
Caption: output some sort of client library and

01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:34.400
Caption: so you know that know the people that

01:35:32.159 --> 01:35:35.360
Caption: depend on that client library so you can

01:35:34.399 --> 01:35:38.080
Caption: check

01:35:35.359 --> 01:35:38.080
Caption: those usages

01:35:38.238 --> 01:35:43.359
Caption: external is a much harder is a much

01:35:41.439 --> 01:35:45.439
Caption: harder thing it&#39;s essentially a

01:35:43.359 --> 01:35:47.600
Caption: library right so you have to

01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:50.080
Caption: you have to deprecate fields and give

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:52.320
Caption: comms to that and

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:54.320
Caption: wait a lot more time

01:35:52.319 --> 01:35:55.759
Caption: that that becomes a much harder deal but

01:35:54.319 --> 01:35:57.119
Caption: internally

01:35:55.759 --> 01:35:59.279
Caption: this stuff is

01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:00.879
Caption: it shouldn&#39;t be hard

01:35:59.279 --> 01:36:02.559
Caption: it is for all sorts of reasons but it

01:36:00.879 --> 01:36:04.879
Caption: shouldn&#39;t be hard and you can you can

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:05.919
Caption: make great strides internally at least

01:36:04.879 --> 01:36:07.919
Caption: um

01:36:05.919 --> 01:36:09.678
Caption: i think

01:36:07.919 --> 01:36:10.399
Caption: i feel like that was super vague but

01:36:09.679 --> 01:36:14.360
Caption: yeah

01:36:10.399 --> 01:36:14.359
Caption: there&#39;s definitely tools out there

01:36:28.719 --> 01:36:32.800
Caption: it&#39;s turned off there we go there we go

01:36:30.639 --> 01:36:34.880
Caption: it&#39;s just gonna expand on that question

01:36:32.799 --> 01:36:38.158
Caption: so a few years ago i had a bit of

01:36:34.879 --> 01:36:38.669
Caption: experience working with you um and here

01:36:38.159 --> 01:36:40.959
Caption: we go

01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:43.279
Caption: [Laughter]

01:36:40.959 --> 01:36:45.279
Caption: it was an awesome experience but um i

01:36:43.279 --> 01:36:47.919
Caption: love the expand rollout contract but

01:36:45.279 --> 01:36:50.718
Caption: adding to that question we experimented

01:36:47.919 --> 01:36:52.799
Caption: with like consumer driven

01:36:50.719 --> 01:36:55.040
Caption: contract testing yeah but it never

01:36:52.799 --> 01:36:57.919
Caption: really seemed to take hold it never

01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:00.719
Caption: really seemed to um like work and i was

01:36:57.919 --> 01:37:02.799
Caption: just wondering where did it land like um

01:37:00.719 --> 01:37:06.159
Caption: did you get it working or did you find

01:37:02.799 --> 01:37:08.000
Caption: other ways uh so so i have seen other

01:37:06.159 --> 01:37:10.560
Caption: implementations that worked

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.639
Caption: but we ended up ripping it out

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:14.159
Caption: and going for as i was sort of talking

01:37:12.639 --> 01:37:16.560
Caption: about before having

01:37:14.159 --> 01:37:18.959
Caption: a client

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:21.280
Caption: so each api would spit out a client

01:37:18.959 --> 01:37:23.679
Caption: library and

01:37:21.279 --> 01:37:25.039
Caption: for either like back-end services so

01:37:23.679 --> 01:37:27.600
Caption: like java

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:31.679
Caption: or front-end as well

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:33.199
Caption: and the key to that is also that

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:35.119
Caption: so we would

01:37:33.199 --> 01:37:37.040
Caption: so we had a lot of issues early days

01:37:35.119 --> 01:37:39.040
Caption: where we would make backwards

01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:41.359
Caption: incompatible changes so we would just

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:42.799
Caption: sort of forget about consumers and break

01:37:41.359 --> 01:37:44.319
Caption: them

01:37:42.799 --> 01:37:45.919
Caption: thinking that contract testing was going

01:37:44.319 --> 01:37:46.638
Caption: to help us

01:37:45.919 --> 01:37:48.399
Caption: so

01:37:46.639 --> 01:37:49.439
Caption: we ended up writing

01:37:48.399 --> 01:37:51.040
Caption: um

01:37:49.439 --> 01:37:52.238
Caption: and there&#39;s again there&#39;s plenty of

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:54.239
Caption: tools out there that sort of check your

01:37:52.238 --> 01:37:56.959
Caption: swagger and fail your build when you

01:37:54.238 --> 01:37:58.399
Caption: make backwards into incompatible changes

01:37:56.959 --> 01:38:00.159
Caption: that&#39;s not to say that you that you

01:37:58.399 --> 01:38:02.080
Caption: can&#39;t make them but you have to do it in

01:38:00.159 --> 01:38:04.639
Caption: a measured way so you don&#39;t make them

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:08.000
Caption: unless you have sort of proven and sort

01:38:04.639 --> 01:38:10.880
Caption: of gone through all your you know

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.959
Caption: git repos and checked that

01:38:10.879 --> 01:38:15.839
Caption: the other consumers are not using that

01:38:12.959 --> 01:38:16.639
Caption: field or that endpoint anymore

01:38:15.839 --> 01:38:18.799
Caption: and

01:38:16.639 --> 01:38:21.119
Caption: and that&#39;s usually just a case of

01:38:18.799 --> 01:38:23.279
Caption: a search um

01:38:21.119 --> 01:38:25.600
Caption: but but yeah first of all you don&#39;t make

01:38:23.279 --> 01:38:28.479
Caption: those backwards incompatible changes

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:31.840
Caption: by default at least

01:38:28.479 --> 01:38:31.839
Caption: cool thank you

01:38:35.119 --> 01:38:40.719
Caption: uh yeah about feature toggling so i&#39;ve

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.719
Caption: seen feature talking uh fail terribly

01:38:40.719 --> 01:38:44.480
Caption: thankfully not because of me but of some

01:38:42.719 --> 01:38:47.440
Caption: people and i was a

01:38:44.479 --> 01:38:49.119
Caption: a very fortunate spectator about it so

01:38:47.439 --> 01:38:51.040
Caption: so i&#39;ve seen it fail many times even

01:38:49.119 --> 01:38:53.520
Caption: though i were i was perfectly capable of

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:55.359
Caption: doing so uh also my project my question

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:57.040
Caption: is that um do you think picture toggling

01:38:55.359 --> 01:38:59.040
Caption: is more of an engineering thing than a

01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.560
Caption: devops thingy

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:03.839
Caption: um

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:05.280
Caption: so so i have devops in my talk title but

01:39:03.839 --> 01:39:08.080
Caption: i think

01:39:05.279 --> 01:39:09.439
Caption: i think the concept of having it

01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.320
Caption: so first of all i think the concept of

01:39:09.439 --> 01:39:13.359
Caption: having

01:39:10.319 --> 01:39:14.718
Caption: devops as a as a role or something feels

01:39:13.359 --> 01:39:15.759
Caption: like it&#39;s defeating the purpose of

01:39:14.719 --> 01:39:18.480
Caption: devops

01:39:15.759 --> 01:39:19.839
Caption: um but uh

01:39:18.479 --> 01:39:22.080
Caption: i guess

01:39:19.839 --> 01:39:22.080
Caption: uh

01:39:22.879 --> 01:39:25.600
Caption: i think i&#39;ve lost track of what i was

01:39:24.319 --> 01:39:28.319
Caption: thinking what was your ask ask a

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:28.320
Caption: question again sorry

01:39:29.679 --> 01:39:32.719
Caption: yeah okay so so that&#39;s i guess my

01:39:31.679 --> 01:39:35.119
Caption: thought is

01:39:32.719 --> 01:39:36.000
Caption: it should there&#39;s there&#39;s no distinction

01:39:35.119 --> 01:39:36.880
Caption: for me

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.080
Caption: um

01:39:36.879 --> 01:39:40.319
Caption: engineering

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:43.280
Caption: engineers at the like the whole point of

01:39:40.319 --> 01:39:45.439
Caption: devops is that you&#39;ve just got

01:39:43.279 --> 01:39:46.959
Caption: smart people doing like

01:39:45.439 --> 01:39:48.560
Caption: work

01:39:46.959 --> 01:39:50.879
Caption: um

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:50.879
Caption: right

01:39:53.119 --> 01:39:55.679
Caption: ideally right

01:39:54.399 --> 01:39:57.919
Caption: so so

01:39:55.679 --> 01:40:00.400
Caption: so the the point of devops is like that

01:39:57.919 --> 01:40:02.879
Caption: you&#39;re you&#39;re bringing in all these um

01:40:00.399 --> 01:40:04.399
Caption: people and working together so i mean

01:40:02.879 --> 01:40:06.799
Caption: maybe it&#39;s not one person maybe it&#39;s one

01:40:04.399 --> 01:40:09.040
Caption: team but um

01:40:06.799 --> 01:40:11.040
Caption: but distinguishing between

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:12.719
Caption: like actually

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:14.959
Caption: uh having a specific role for devops

01:40:12.719 --> 01:40:15.920
Caption: doesn&#39;t make sense to me because you&#39;re

01:40:14.959 --> 01:40:17.359
Caption: just

01:40:15.919 --> 01:40:19.839
Caption: a team of people working towards

01:40:17.359 --> 01:40:19.839
Caption: improving

01:40:31.119 --> 01:40:35.280
Caption: yeah hey hey dylan um yeah my question

01:40:33.439 --> 01:40:37.759
Caption: is also about feature toggling so i&#39;ve

01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:40.638
Caption: seen you know teams losing track

01:40:37.759 --> 01:40:44.000
Caption: of the toggles not cleaning up um

01:40:40.639 --> 01:40:47.040
Caption: did you have any kind of tooling um in

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.959
Caption: place or also you kind of presented to

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:50.399
Caption: maybe the business and look that&#39;s

01:40:48.959 --> 01:40:52.319
Caption: that&#39;s in production

01:40:50.399 --> 01:40:54.638
Caption: now we we turn it on and then we clean

01:40:52.319 --> 01:40:56.718
Caption: it up it&#39;s kind because let&#39;s say four

01:40:54.639 --> 01:40:58.719
Caption: teams 20 components yeah you might lose

01:40:56.719 --> 01:41:00.560
Caption: it yeah yeah so so that was a that&#39;s a

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:01.520
Caption: big thing for us so

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.399
Caption: um

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:06.319
Caption: so

01:41:02.399 --> 01:41:07.439
Caption: bankwest were using um sort of uh

01:41:06.319 --> 01:41:10.158
Caption: i would say

01:41:07.439 --> 01:41:12.238
Caption: like internal tools for for the

01:41:10.159 --> 01:41:13.760
Caption: feature doggles and also managing them

01:41:12.238 --> 01:41:15.759
Caption: but we

01:41:13.759 --> 01:41:17.839
Caption: we definitely had visibility of what

01:41:15.759 --> 01:41:19.439
Caption: toggles each team owned

01:41:17.839 --> 01:41:20.718
Caption: how long they&#39;d been

01:41:19.439 --> 01:41:22.399
Caption: turned on

01:41:20.719 --> 01:41:24.560
Caption: the state of them in each of our

01:41:22.399 --> 01:41:26.638
Caption: environments um so we had full

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.919
Caption: visibility and you know

01:41:26.639 --> 01:41:29.520
Caption: i don&#39;t know it seems silly but like if

01:41:27.919 --> 01:41:31.839
Caption: they got too old they would go that

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:33.679
Caption: would go red right we would know that

01:41:31.839 --> 01:41:34.638
Caption: this thing is getting old um there was

01:41:33.679 --> 01:41:36.320
Caption: like a

01:41:34.639 --> 01:41:38.479
Caption: it has to be a conscious decision to

01:41:36.319 --> 01:41:41.439
Caption: keep that thing around because it&#39;s like

01:41:38.479 --> 01:41:42.399
Caption: in your face um and

01:41:41.439 --> 01:41:44.479
Caption: like

01:41:42.399 --> 01:41:47.040
Caption: uh you know that was all custom stuff

01:41:44.479 --> 01:41:49.359
Caption: but like tools like launch darkly and

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:52.239
Caption: stuff um which are the

01:41:49.359 --> 01:41:54.158
Caption: popular popular ones in the um you know

01:41:52.238 --> 01:41:55.759
Caption: outside world uh

01:41:54.159 --> 01:41:58.719
Caption: they they have all this stuff like you

01:41:55.759 --> 01:42:01.919
Caption: can see how old toggles are and um you

01:41:58.719 --> 01:42:03.679
Caption: know we basically wouldn&#39;t start work um

01:42:01.919 --> 01:42:05.919
Caption: or wouldn&#39;t be able to deliver our new

01:42:03.679 --> 01:42:08.159
Caption: feature until we got rid of the old

01:42:05.919 --> 01:42:09.040
Caption: feature toggles um so

01:42:08.159 --> 01:42:11.119
Caption: like

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.040
Caption: yeah i mean that&#39;s a bit of process but

01:42:11.119 --> 01:42:15.439
Caption: like you have to have that

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.280
Caption: ability to you know something to audit

01:42:15.439 --> 01:42:18.479
Caption: like removing stuff

01:42:17.279 --> 01:42:20.959
Caption: otherwise i just forget yet it&#39;s

01:42:18.479 --> 01:42:23.199
Caption: forgotten about

01:42:20.959 --> 01:42:26.080
Caption: um where then dylan um you can have the

01:42:23.199 --> 01:42:29.199
Caption: speed up in your deployment but as a

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:31.119
Caption: consumer of the database and i did a lot

01:42:29.199 --> 01:42:33.600
Caption: of analytics

01:42:31.119 --> 01:42:36.080
Caption: and machine learning and in your example

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:38.879
Caption: you change the field name

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:40.239
Caption: that will break my code

01:42:38.879 --> 01:42:43.520
Caption: how you

01:42:40.238 --> 01:42:44.559
Caption: make my life easy as well yeah right so

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:47.439
Caption: so

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:50.239
Caption: um i guess that&#39;s why that&#39;s why you&#39;re

01:42:47.439 --> 01:42:52.560
Caption: taking the measured approach of uh not

01:42:50.238 --> 01:42:55.118
Caption: renaming it&#39;s so there&#39;s no such thing

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.359
Caption: as a rename basically um there&#39;s there&#39;s

01:42:55.119 --> 01:43:00.080
Caption: a an add and a remove but it&#39;s a

01:42:57.359 --> 01:43:02.718
Caption: considered step so um in the case of say

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:05.199
Caption: a database you would be adding a column

01:43:02.719 --> 01:43:07.280
Caption: and populating both columns okay and no

01:43:05.199 --> 01:43:08.880
Caption: one&#39;s using that other column

01:43:07.279 --> 01:43:11.759
Caption: you would migrate the data into that

01:43:08.879 --> 01:43:13.279
Caption: other column maybe as a second step

01:43:11.759 --> 01:43:15.279
Caption: only once

01:43:13.279 --> 01:43:16.959
Caption: both columns are sort of working in

01:43:15.279 --> 01:43:19.279
Caption: tandem then you can switch over to

01:43:16.959 --> 01:43:21.119
Caption: actually using that new column so then

01:43:19.279 --> 01:43:22.638
Caption: that would be at the point that you

01:43:21.119 --> 01:43:24.719
Caption: would start to use that new column and

01:43:22.639 --> 01:43:26.959
Caption: once we&#39;ve proven that you&#39;re actually

01:43:24.719 --> 01:43:29.119
Caption: using it and so is everyone else

01:43:26.959 --> 01:43:31.279
Caption: then we can drop that the other column

01:43:29.119 --> 01:43:34.520
Caption: that would be the approach

01:43:31.279 --> 01:43:34.520
Caption: thank you

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:41.919
Caption: hello

01:43:39.919 --> 01:43:44.238
Caption: um

01:43:41.919 --> 01:43:47.359
Caption: for testing um

01:43:44.238 --> 01:43:50.079
Caption: when do you use a load balancer and

01:43:47.359 --> 01:43:52.718
Caption: to divert some of your traffic to

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:56.000
Caption: the new feature and roll it out slowly

01:43:52.719 --> 01:43:56.000
Caption: rather than use feature request

01:43:57.279 --> 01:43:59.678
Caption: um

01:43:58.719 --> 01:44:01.920
Caption: so that&#39;s

01:43:59.679 --> 01:44:04.159
Caption: to be honest not something i have really

01:44:01.919 --> 01:44:05.839
Caption: ever tried um

01:44:04.159 --> 01:44:06.959
Caption: it&#39;s

01:44:05.839 --> 01:44:09.040
Caption: uh

01:44:06.959 --> 01:44:11.679
Caption: i&#39;m sure it&#39;s a valid approach but

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:13.600
Caption: most of the stuff that i have done is

01:44:11.679 --> 01:44:16.479
Caption: more about um

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:20.000
Caption: you would deploy um

01:44:16.479 --> 01:44:21.040
Caption: so i guess that&#39;s more about like uh

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.279
Caption: uh

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:24.959
Caption: what&#39;s it called like

01:44:23.279 --> 01:44:27.759
Caption: like share it like basically shadowing

01:44:24.959 --> 01:44:30.000
Caption: requests to some sort of um to some sort

01:44:27.759 --> 01:44:33.839
Caption: of system before you take it and make it

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.439
Caption: live um but

01:44:33.839 --> 01:44:37.439
Caption: yeah i i don&#39;t have experience

01:44:35.439 --> 01:44:39.040
Caption: personally most of it uh most of the

01:44:37.439 --> 01:44:40.879
Caption: things that i do is like you actually

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:44.000
Caption: deploy the thing into production um and

01:44:40.879 --> 01:44:46.399
Caption: the code isn&#39;t active so so you actually

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.919
Caption: you&#39;re not really having two versions

01:44:46.399 --> 01:44:50.399
Caption: running at once you&#39;re just switching

01:44:47.919 --> 01:44:51.439
Caption: over and then you can

01:44:50.399 --> 01:44:54.080
Caption: control

01:44:51.439 --> 01:44:56.479
Caption: uh turn on some toggle or some toggle

01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:58.000
Caption: for specific users yeah it&#39;s more about

01:44:56.479 --> 01:45:01.000
Caption: that that&#39;s easier to reason about in my

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Caption: head

01:45:03.759 --> 01:45:08.479
Caption: um so i guess it&#39;s pretty much

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.560
Caption: down to the concept that we&#39;re deploying

01:45:08.479 --> 01:45:13.679
Caption: with a high level of frequency

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:16.719
Caption: which implies to me that

01:45:13.679 --> 01:45:18.639
Caption: we&#39;re more prone to

01:45:16.719 --> 01:45:19.840
Caption: put bugs into the production environment

01:45:18.639 --> 01:45:22.320
Caption: although i understand that it&#39;s probably

01:45:19.839 --> 01:45:24.879
Caption: with a smaller user base

01:45:22.319 --> 01:45:27.520
Caption: how do you

01:45:24.879 --> 01:45:29.520
Caption: rash rationalize that like is is it just

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:32.000
Caption: subjective do you go oh these users are

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:33.760
Caption: prepared to cop it so it&#39;s okay or

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.759
Caption: what&#39;s going on there yeah yeah okay so

01:45:33.759 --> 01:45:39.198
Caption: i totally get that so we&#39;re so releasing

01:45:35.759 --> 01:45:41.279
Caption: more often uh more likely that code is

01:45:39.199 --> 01:45:42.400
Caption: less ready um and

01:45:41.279 --> 01:45:45.439
Caption: getting into the hands of our users

01:45:42.399 --> 01:45:47.439
Caption: right so so the key thing is that um

01:45:45.439 --> 01:45:48.319
Caption: ideally we&#39;re ex

01:45:47.439 --> 01:45:49.839
Caption: so

01:45:48.319 --> 01:45:52.799
Caption: with feature toggles you&#39;re exposing

01:45:49.839 --> 01:45:56.080
Caption: less of your users um so you&#39;re maybe

01:45:52.799 --> 01:45:57.919
Caption: only exposing your team initially right

01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:59.760
Caption: and i know that&#39;s hard for depending on

01:45:57.919 --> 01:46:01.040
Caption: your system um

01:45:59.759 --> 01:46:02.959
Caption: because some

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:04.959
Caption: depending on your system your your users

01:46:02.959 --> 01:46:07.198
Caption: are um

01:46:04.959 --> 01:46:09.520
Caption: like your team is not really able to dog

01:46:07.199 --> 01:46:10.719
Caption: food your your app right um

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:13.119
Caption: particularly in the case of bankwest

01:46:10.719 --> 01:46:14.639
Caption: where um like how

01:46:13.119 --> 01:46:15.760
Caption: my team wasn&#39;t applying for a home loan

01:46:14.639 --> 01:46:16.800
Caption: every week

01:46:15.759 --> 01:46:18.638
Caption: um

01:46:16.799 --> 01:46:20.238
Caption: so so but we&#39;ve got other environments

01:46:18.639 --> 01:46:22.639
Caption: where we do that right where we might

01:46:20.238 --> 01:46:24.079
Caption: turn on in that particular environment

01:46:22.639 --> 01:46:26.000
Caption: we might turn on

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:27.520
Caption: just for my team until until we&#39;re

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.839
Caption: really happy so we&#39;re not even affecting

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:31.040
Caption: other teams we&#39;re just affecting my team

01:46:29.839 --> 01:46:32.638
Caption: okay the team that&#39;s actually building

01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:33.760
Caption: out that functionality

01:46:32.639 --> 01:46:35.919
Caption: um

01:46:33.759 --> 01:46:39.759
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely a

01:46:35.919 --> 01:46:41.839
Caption: risk um but i would trade it off with

01:46:39.759 --> 01:46:43.439
Caption: the fact that if you&#39;re

01:46:41.839 --> 01:46:45.359
Caption: bulking up you know two months of

01:46:43.439 --> 01:46:47.520
Caption: changes and sending that into production

01:46:45.359 --> 01:46:49.759
Caption: and that breaks like

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:51.359
Caption: well what went wrong

01:46:49.759 --> 01:46:52.399
Caption: two months of work i have to sift

01:46:51.359 --> 01:46:54.000
Caption: through two months of work to figure out

01:46:52.399 --> 01:46:55.919
Caption: what the hell went wrong that&#39;s going to

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.799
Caption: take me much longer

01:46:55.919 --> 01:46:59.600
Caption: than

01:46:56.799 --> 01:47:01.118
Caption: say that one thing that i said i guess

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:03.359
Caption: just to add to that so

01:47:01.119 --> 01:47:05.520
Caption: it is it seems like it is kind of

01:47:03.359 --> 01:47:08.399
Caption: subjective we haven&#39;t necessarily been

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:10.239
Caption: able to quantify doing this way has less

01:47:08.399 --> 01:47:11.198
Caption: impact than doing the other way it just

01:47:10.238 --> 01:47:13.198
Caption: like

01:47:11.199 --> 01:47:14.719
Caption: seems that way because we&#39;re not as

01:47:13.199 --> 01:47:17.040
Caption: stressed in the

01:47:14.719 --> 01:47:18.560
Caption: yeah it&#39;s large releases of deployments

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.679
Caption: yeah um

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:22.319
Caption: but

01:47:19.679 --> 01:47:25.199
Caption: yeah i i don&#39;t have no for sure i don&#39;t

01:47:22.319 --> 01:47:26.399
Caption: i don&#39;t have i don&#39;t have numbers um but

01:47:25.199 --> 01:47:27.360
Caption: i

01:47:26.399 --> 01:47:28.959
Caption: uh

01:47:27.359 --> 01:47:31.040
Caption: i guess

01:47:28.959 --> 01:47:35.119
Caption: uh i guess i&#39;ve definitely seen the

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:38.000
Caption: alternative um so from my experience um

01:47:35.119 --> 01:47:40.080
Caption: i&#39;ve seen deployments go wrong and go go

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.719
Caption: wrong catastrophically

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:42.719
Caption: way more

01:47:42.879 --> 01:47:47.040
Caption: when you&#39;re deploying you know monthly

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:49.040
Caption: or whatever yes it seems like that the

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:50.719
Caption: impact will be less with

01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:52.239
Caption: a higher frequency of deployment even if

01:47:50.719 --> 01:47:54.239
Caption: there are more bugs then yeah it&#39;s

01:47:52.238 --> 01:47:56.399
Caption: damaging so maybe that&#39;s okay and it&#39;s

01:47:54.238 --> 01:47:59.359
Caption: and it&#39;s way less stress as a developer

01:47:56.399 --> 01:48:01.439
Caption: which ideally uh also in turn

01:47:59.359 --> 01:48:05.560
Caption: makes for less bugs but for sure i don&#39;t

01:48:01.439 --> 01:48:05.560
Caption: have numbers no thanks

01:48:08.399 --> 01:48:13.759
Caption: oh great um

01:48:10.479 --> 01:48:16.639
Caption: so i also i work at a bank i work for up

01:48:13.759 --> 01:48:18.879
Caption: which is now owned by bendigo so we we

01:48:16.639 --> 01:48:20.080
Caption: ship six to ten times a day but bendigo

01:48:18.879 --> 01:48:22.479
Caption: might ship

01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:25.040
Caption: once every few months um

01:48:22.479 --> 01:48:27.520
Caption: were there any things you had to do

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:30.399
Caption: to bring the other teams within the bank

01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:32.560
Caption: along this journey to allow you to

01:48:30.399 --> 01:48:34.718
Caption: to ship multiple times a day and release

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:37.040
Caption: more frequently thinking like

01:48:34.719 --> 01:48:40.719
Caption: risk teams and those yeah

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:40.719
Caption: yeah so that&#39;s definitely um

01:48:41.919 --> 01:48:46.479
Caption: that&#39;s definitely a hard one right um

01:48:44.719 --> 01:48:47.679
Caption: and i think

01:48:46.479 --> 01:48:49.679
Caption: uh

01:48:47.679 --> 01:48:52.639
Caption: what made it possible at least um at

01:48:49.679 --> 01:48:54.639
Caption: bankwest was uh

01:48:52.639 --> 01:48:57.280
Caption: the setup of the team so so again when

01:48:54.639 --> 01:48:59.679
Caption: when these things arise say four

01:48:57.279 --> 01:49:02.718
Caption: deployments we we brought in our system

01:48:59.679 --> 01:49:03.840
Caption: engineers into the team um so actually

01:49:02.719 --> 01:49:06.880
Caption: having

01:49:03.839 --> 01:49:08.399
Caption: like bringing the critical people um on

01:49:06.879 --> 01:49:10.080
Caption: the path like

01:49:08.399 --> 01:49:12.959
Caption: critical expertise bringing them

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:15.119
Caption: actually into our our teams even

01:49:12.959 --> 01:49:17.119
Caption: or our you know our project sphere

01:49:15.119 --> 01:49:18.719
Caption: whatever you want to call it um but

01:49:17.119 --> 01:49:21.199
Caption: actually bringing them in so so their

01:49:18.719 --> 01:49:22.880
Caption: goals are your goals um

01:49:21.199 --> 01:49:24.400
Caption: it&#39;s like it&#39;s not an easy problem for

01:49:22.879 --> 01:49:26.560
Caption: sure um there&#39;s a lot of different

01:49:24.399 --> 01:49:28.718
Caption: disciplines that need to be involved but

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:30.800
Caption: ideally where you can bring them in and

01:49:28.719 --> 01:49:33.040
Caption: so you&#39;re both heading in that same

01:49:30.799 --> 01:49:34.879
Caption: direction um

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:36.479
Caption: yeah that&#39;s is that something to do with

01:49:34.879 --> 01:49:39.118
Caption: your methodology as well like being

01:49:36.479 --> 01:49:41.199
Caption: truly agile as well and having that

01:49:39.119 --> 01:49:43.840
Caption: framework across the organization to

01:49:41.199 --> 01:49:45.040
Caption: accept continuous

01:49:43.839 --> 01:49:46.799
Caption: development

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:48.879
Caption: yeah i think that&#39;s

01:49:46.799 --> 01:49:50.158
Caption: like all this stuff is a is a constant

01:49:48.879 --> 01:49:51.839
Caption: um

01:49:50.159 --> 01:49:53.280
Caption: well you constantly hit up against these

01:49:51.839 --> 01:49:55.599
Caption: sort of problems but also you&#39;re

01:49:53.279 --> 01:49:57.599
Caption: constantly trying to improve

01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:59.919
Caption: and you know any organization is not

01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:01.840
Caption: going to be um

01:49:59.919 --> 01:50:02.959
Caption: homogenous right it&#39;s that

01:50:01.839 --> 01:50:04.238
Caption: all different areas are going to be

01:50:02.959 --> 01:50:07.600
Caption: totally different and work in totally

01:50:04.238 --> 01:50:09.759
Caption: different ways but um yeah i think if

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:12.159
Caption: you can somehow align on like what

01:50:09.759 --> 01:50:14.079
Caption: you&#39;re trying to achieve

01:50:12.159 --> 01:50:15.439
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s how you get that done

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.040
Caption: very good

01:50:15.439 --> 01:50:20.520
Caption: all right well thank you very much

01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:20.520
Caption: that&#39;s a great presentation

01:50:22.649 --> 01:50:26.089

Caption: conference for us

02:04:45.759 --> 02:04:50.799
Caption: so today what i want to talk about is

02:04:48.238 --> 02:04:53.678
Caption: human centered design and this is a term

02:04:50.799 --> 02:04:55.598
Caption: that&#39;s actually coined by don norman don

02:04:53.679 --> 02:04:57.440
Caption: norman wrote a really great book called

02:04:55.599 --> 02:04:59.119
Caption: the design of everyday things that i

02:04:57.439 --> 02:05:01.279
Caption: highly recommend

02:04:59.119 --> 02:05:03.840
Caption: and he says the goal is to produce a

02:05:01.279 --> 02:05:06.799
Caption: great product one that is successful and

02:05:03.839 --> 02:05:08.638
Caption: that customers love it can be done so

02:05:06.799 --> 02:05:10.879
Caption: this is all about empathy which is

02:05:08.639 --> 02:05:13.119
Caption: something that we are familiar with many

02:05:10.879 --> 02:05:15.040
Caption: from uh ux design

02:05:13.119 --> 02:05:17.919
Caption: and we&#39;re looking here at putting people

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:20.000
Caption: first we&#39;re looking past the visuals but

02:05:17.919 --> 02:05:21.759
Caption: unlike what we see in ux design we&#39;re

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.719
Caption: actually also looking past the

02:05:21.759 --> 02:05:27.279
Caption: functionality to focus on the thoughts

02:05:24.719 --> 02:05:30.960
Caption: and the feelings of the people who are

02:05:27.279 --> 02:05:32.959
Caption: using your app and your product

02:05:30.959 --> 02:05:35.119
Caption: so how do we do that

02:05:32.959 --> 02:05:38.000
Caption: well most of the time we&#39;d start with a

02:05:35.119 --> 02:05:40.719
Caption: persona so let&#39;s meet ben

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.839
Caption: ben is a software developer here in

02:05:40.719 --> 02:05:47.040
Caption: perth he&#39;s married he doesn&#39;t have any

02:05:43.839 --> 02:05:49.520
Caption: kids he&#39;s got terrible taste in music

02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:51.599
Caption: and he enjoys rock climbing and running

02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:53.520
Caption: as his two main hobbies

02:05:51.599 --> 02:05:55.280
Caption: once we&#39;ve written our persona we might

02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:57.439
Caption: make some scenarios

02:05:55.279 --> 02:06:00.799
Caption: and chances are once we&#39;ve written those

02:05:57.439 --> 02:06:03.919
Caption: scenarios the language that we use to

02:06:00.799 --> 02:06:06.399
Caption: talk about band changes

02:06:03.919 --> 02:06:10.080
Caption: we might find we start using words like

02:06:06.399 --> 02:06:14.000
Caption: user like visitor click subscriber

02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:15.599
Caption: traffic customer the language goes on

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Caption: these words

02:06:15.599 --> 02:06:20.719
Caption: are actually quite problematic because

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:23.599
Caption: they focus themselves on the role of the

02:06:20.719 --> 02:06:25.679
Caption: user when they&#39;re using your product

02:06:23.599 --> 02:06:28.320
Caption: we assign a role to them based on that

02:06:25.679 --> 02:06:30.719
Caption: interaction and based on how we intend

02:06:28.319 --> 02:06:32.799
Caption: to profit from them

02:06:30.719 --> 02:06:35.679
Caption: don norman who i mentioned coined the

02:06:32.799 --> 02:06:37.678
Caption: term human experience design is actually

02:06:35.679 --> 02:06:39.520
Caption: the one who coined the term user

02:06:37.679 --> 02:06:42.000
Caption: experience design

02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:44.319
Caption: and he developed what we call human

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:47.520
Caption: sensor design because he also thought

02:06:44.319 --> 02:06:49.678
Caption: these words were quite problematic

02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:51.359
Caption: because ben is none of those things

02:06:49.679 --> 02:06:52.959
Caption: ben&#39;s a person

02:06:51.359 --> 02:06:55.118
Caption: so the first thing that we really need

02:06:52.959 --> 02:06:57.759
Caption: to be doing here is changing our

02:06:55.119 --> 02:06:58.959
Caption: terminology and calling our audience

02:06:57.759 --> 02:07:01.118
Caption: people

02:06:58.959 --> 02:07:02.718
Caption: they&#39;re not users they&#39;re not visitors

02:07:01.119 --> 02:07:05.040
Caption: and they&#39;re not clicks

02:07:02.719 --> 02:07:07.280
Caption: this is a really small change that we

02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:09.839
Caption: can be making in our internal documents

02:07:07.279 --> 02:07:13.039
Caption: in our company but it actually allows us

02:07:09.839 --> 02:07:15.439
Caption: to refocus our team on what&#39;s important

02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:17.439
Caption: and that&#39;s this big messy

02:07:15.439 --> 02:07:19.839
Caption: complicated experience that we call

02:07:17.439 --> 02:07:23.439
Caption: being human and the fact that your app&#39;s

02:07:19.839 --> 02:07:25.678
Caption: only one small part of that

02:07:23.439 --> 02:07:28.479
Caption: because let&#39;s face it being human is

02:07:25.679 --> 02:07:30.560
Caption: complicated just look at ben

02:07:28.479 --> 02:07:33.359
Caption: ben screws up a lot

02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:35.679
Caption: do you really think you can account for

02:07:33.359 --> 02:07:39.040
Caption: all of the different ways ben manages to

02:07:35.679 --> 02:07:41.119
Caption: screw up on an almost daily basis

02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:43.199
Caption: ben is lazy

02:07:41.119 --> 02:07:45.199
Caption: ben doesn&#39;t like having to get up in the

02:07:43.199 --> 02:07:47.520
Caption: mornings he&#39;ll often leave for work at

02:07:45.199 --> 02:07:50.159
Caption: the last possible moment

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:52.079
Caption: he&#39;s unpredictable not even his wife can

02:07:50.159 --> 02:07:54.000
Caption: sometimes predict some of the behavior

02:07:52.079 --> 02:07:57.199
Caption: that he manages and the decisions that

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:59.199
Caption: he makes he&#39;s very complex like most of

02:07:57.199 --> 02:08:01.520
Caption: us ben will often believe in

02:07:59.199 --> 02:08:03.440
Caption: contradictory things at the same time

02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:04.399
Caption: and getting very heated arguments about

02:08:03.439 --> 02:08:06.799
Caption: them

02:08:04.399 --> 02:08:08.560
Caption: ben also wastes a lot of time he&#39;ll

02:08:06.799 --> 02:08:10.399
Caption: spend a lot of time on his phone

02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:13.439
Caption: browsing reddit

02:08:10.399 --> 02:08:16.319
Caption: a lot of time watching tv

02:08:13.439 --> 02:08:18.879
Caption: when we use language like visitor like

02:08:16.319 --> 02:08:22.078
Caption: user we are suggesting that there&#39;s a

02:08:18.879 --> 02:08:24.638
Caption: such thing as an ideal user for our app

02:08:22.079 --> 02:08:27.359
Caption: and there is no ideal user that doesn&#39;t

02:08:24.639 --> 02:08:29.520
Caption: exist we don&#39;t know the situation ben&#39;s

02:08:27.359 --> 02:08:31.598
Caption: going to be in when he uses our app we

02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:33.119
Caption: don&#39;t know the environment

02:08:31.599 --> 02:08:35.199
Caption: we don&#39;t know how he&#39;s going to be

02:08:33.119 --> 02:08:37.919
Caption: thinking of feeling

02:08:35.199 --> 02:08:41.119
Caption: so we really need to be thinking about

02:08:37.919 --> 02:08:43.919
Caption: how we can change this terminology and

02:08:41.119 --> 02:08:46.079
Caption: think of ben as being human because if

02:08:43.919 --> 02:08:48.319
Caption: we don&#39;t do this ben&#39;s going to find our

02:08:46.079 --> 02:08:50.399
Caption: app really frustrating to use

02:08:48.319 --> 02:08:52.078
Caption: and when ben gets frustrated when he

02:08:50.399 --> 02:08:54.879
Caption: does screw up

02:08:52.079 --> 02:08:56.479
Caption: it&#39;s not ben&#39;s fault ben&#39;s very good at

02:08:54.879 --> 02:08:58.959
Caption: blaming other people

02:08:56.479 --> 02:09:00.560
Caption: it&#39;ll always be your fault as the

02:08:58.959 --> 02:09:03.119
Caption: designer

02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:06.479
Caption: a way around this as i tell my students

02:09:03.119 --> 02:09:09.199
Caption: when i&#39;m teaching is to ask why

02:09:06.479 --> 02:09:11.679
Caption: you want to ask why five times is a

02:09:09.199 --> 02:09:13.760
Caption: guide that i give my students and we do

02:09:11.679 --> 02:09:14.800
Caption: this because human error is never the

02:09:13.759 --> 02:09:16.559
Caption: answer

02:09:14.799 --> 02:09:18.559
Caption: if the answer you&#39;ve come up with is

02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:20.719
Caption: that it&#39;s ben&#39;s fault you have to keep

02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:22.159
Caption: digging because ben will not accept the

02:09:20.719 --> 02:09:24.159
Caption: blame

02:09:22.159 --> 02:09:26.320
Caption: you need to look beyond the feature that

02:09:24.159 --> 02:09:30.320
Caption: ben&#39;s gotten stuck at and look at the

02:09:26.319 --> 02:09:30.319
Caption: problem with the system itself

02:09:30.479 --> 02:09:33.839
Caption: because

02:09:31.439 --> 02:09:34.959
Caption: ben cares about a lot more than your

02:09:33.839 --> 02:09:37.598
Caption: product

02:09:34.959 --> 02:09:39.599
Caption: so we need to look beyond the product

02:09:37.599 --> 02:09:40.959
Caption: itself beyond the features that you&#39;ve

02:09:39.599 --> 02:09:42.800
Caption: developed

02:09:40.959 --> 02:09:44.639
Caption: ben himself he cares about climate

02:09:42.799 --> 02:09:46.799
Caption: change he&#39;s quite concerned about the

02:09:44.639 --> 02:09:49.280
Caption: world he&#39;s very aware given he&#39;s a

02:09:46.799 --> 02:09:51.678
Caption: developer about how his data is being

02:09:49.279 --> 02:09:55.279
Caption: used and about the kinds of permissions

02:09:51.679 --> 02:09:58.079
Caption: that he&#39;s granting the apps that he uses

02:09:55.279 --> 02:10:01.118
Caption: ben&#39;s much less likely to use your app

02:09:58.079 --> 02:10:03.439
Caption: if it&#39;s not ethical now i&#39;m going to put

02:10:01.119 --> 02:10:05.760
Caption: a little asterisk here because human

02:10:03.439 --> 02:10:08.159
Caption: centered design doesn&#39;t have to be

02:10:05.759 --> 02:10:09.359
Caption: ethical and we see plenty of examples

02:10:08.159 --> 02:10:11.439
Caption: that aren&#39;t

02:10:09.359 --> 02:10:13.919
Caption: but human centered design is about

02:10:11.439 --> 02:10:16.079
Caption: focusing on the experience and creating

02:10:13.919 --> 02:10:20.319
Caption: a positive experience for people using

02:10:16.079 --> 02:10:22.800
Caption: your app so it should always be ethical

02:10:20.319 --> 02:10:24.799
Caption: and when we&#39;re talking about ethics what

02:10:22.799 --> 02:10:26.879
Caption: we&#39;re really talking about

02:10:24.799 --> 02:10:29.839
Caption: is the respect that you have for your

02:10:26.879 --> 02:10:31.040
Caption: users people are more aware now than

02:10:29.839 --> 02:10:33.118
Caption: ever before

02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:35.359
Caption: thanks to shows like the social dilemma

02:10:33.119 --> 02:10:37.840
Caption: on netflix about the social

02:10:35.359 --> 02:10:40.638
Caption: responsibility the people making their

02:10:37.839 --> 02:10:42.718
Caption: media should have

02:10:40.639 --> 02:10:44.880
Caption: so the very first element we need to

02:10:42.719 --> 02:10:46.400
Caption: consider when we&#39;re talking about ethics

02:10:44.879 --> 02:10:48.319
Caption: is human rights

02:10:46.399 --> 02:10:51.119
Caption: making sure that you protect the

02:10:48.319 --> 02:10:52.078
Caption: fundamental human rights that your app

02:10:51.119 --> 02:10:54.239
Caption: has

02:10:52.079 --> 02:10:57.679
Caption: so we&#39;re looking here about your social

02:10:54.238 --> 02:10:59.198
Caption: responsibility at the very core

02:10:57.679 --> 02:11:00.800
Caption: you want to make sure your app is

02:10:59.199 --> 02:11:03.599
Caption: transparent

02:11:00.799 --> 02:11:05.359
Caption: accessible and sustainable so you don&#39;t

02:11:03.599 --> 02:11:07.439
Caption: want to deceive users

02:11:05.359 --> 02:11:09.118
Caption: a really good example of this is the

02:11:07.439 --> 02:11:11.359
Caption: twitter bluetick

02:11:09.119 --> 02:11:13.360
Caption: when we see a blue tick on twitter we

02:11:11.359 --> 02:11:14.319
Caption: often see it as holding some kind of

02:11:13.359 --> 02:11:16.560
Caption: power

02:11:14.319 --> 02:11:19.359
Caption: we see it as representing a status

02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:21.439
Caption: symbol of power and recognition no one

02:11:19.359 --> 02:11:23.439
Caption: has really exemplified this more than

02:11:21.439 --> 02:11:26.319
Caption: the way people have reacted to donald

02:11:23.439 --> 02:11:28.718
Caption: trump on twitter before he got banned

02:11:26.319 --> 02:11:31.678
Caption: the blue tick actually just

02:11:28.719 --> 02:11:33.920
Caption: recognizes a high profile user it stops

02:11:31.679 --> 02:11:36.400
Caption: other people from impersonating them

02:11:33.919 --> 02:11:38.879
Caption: that&#39;s all that does but the decision

02:11:36.399 --> 02:11:39.919
Caption: that twitter made to use a tick as a

02:11:38.879 --> 02:11:42.319
Caption: symbol

02:11:39.919 --> 02:11:45.439
Caption: very much changes the reaction we have

02:11:42.319 --> 02:11:48.560
Caption: as an audience to that symbol

02:11:45.439 --> 02:11:50.799
Caption: we want to also be transparent in

02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:53.359
Caption: an upfront about the purchases people

02:11:50.799 --> 02:11:55.118
Caption: might need to make in our products

02:11:53.359 --> 02:11:57.839
Caption: we know we&#39;ve all heard of micro

02:11:55.119 --> 02:12:01.439
Caption: transactions ea games made the news a

02:11:57.839 --> 02:12:03.359
Caption: few years ago 2018 2017 over micro

02:12:01.439 --> 02:12:05.520
Caption: transactions

02:12:03.359 --> 02:12:06.718
Caption: the micro transaction industry is still

02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:10.959
Caption: massive

02:12:06.719 --> 02:12:13.040
Caption: in 2021 it was worth 60 billion dollars

02:12:10.959 --> 02:12:16.639
Caption: so there is definitely a lot of money to

02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:18.560
Caption: be made here but is it ethical ea games

02:12:16.639 --> 02:12:21.199
Caption: had developed what they called loot

02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:24.560
Caption: boxes as a way to advance faster in

02:12:21.199 --> 02:12:26.400
Caption: their games we saw belgium in 2018

02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:29.040
Caption: banned these loot boxes as a form of

02:12:26.399 --> 02:12:31.520
Caption: gambling that actually got overturned

02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:33.839
Caption: briefly and it got overturned because

02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:36.639
Caption: the actual legislation that defined what

02:12:33.839 --> 02:12:39.040
Caption: gambling is didn&#39;t cover this form of

02:12:36.639 --> 02:12:41.280
Caption: in-game purchases in apps

02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:43.599
Caption: but while the law wasn&#39;t really up to

02:12:41.279 --> 02:12:47.118
Caption: speed and still is in many countries

02:12:43.599 --> 02:12:50.000
Caption: around our use of microtransactions

02:12:47.119 --> 02:12:53.280
Caption: it doesn&#39;t make it ethical do we really

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Caption: want our kids and our teens in these

02:12:53.279 --> 02:12:59.118
Caption: apps potentially with your credit card

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:02.159
Caption: making these uh purchases and learning

02:12:59.119 --> 02:13:05.599
Caption: from a really young age to gamble rather

02:13:02.159 --> 02:13:07.599
Caption: than putting in the effort for gameplay

02:13:05.599 --> 02:13:09.840
Caption: your product should also aim to reduce

02:13:07.599 --> 02:13:12.800
Caption: inequality which is a really important

02:13:09.839 --> 02:13:15.439
Caption: aspect of human rights this comes down

02:13:12.799 --> 02:13:17.439
Caption: to learnability thinking about how easy

02:13:15.439 --> 02:13:19.520
Caption: it is for first-time users

02:13:17.439 --> 02:13:22.159
Caption: and also that dreaded word that i&#39;m sure

02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:23.760
Caption: we all find frustrated with at times

02:13:22.159 --> 02:13:26.159
Caption: compatibility

02:13:23.759 --> 02:13:29.198
Caption: making sure it works backwards across

02:13:26.159 --> 02:13:29.199
Caption: different devices

02:13:29.679 --> 02:13:35.360
Caption: our next element is respecting human

02:13:32.399 --> 02:13:37.359
Caption: effort so your app should be functional

02:13:35.359 --> 02:13:40.238
Caption: it should also be trustworthy and

02:13:37.359 --> 02:13:42.319
Caption: reliable you want to respect the effort

02:13:40.238 --> 02:13:43.439
Caption: that we&#39;re actually putting into using

02:13:42.319 --> 02:13:46.638
Caption: your app

02:13:43.439 --> 02:13:48.959
Caption: so you want to respect privacy here you

02:13:46.639 --> 02:13:51.360
Caption: want to only collect information from

02:13:48.959 --> 02:13:54.079
Caption: your from the people that are using your

02:13:51.359 --> 02:13:56.799
Caption: app that&#39;s absolutely necessary to be

02:13:54.079 --> 02:13:59.040
Caption: using it we are more aware than ever as

02:13:56.799 --> 02:14:02.718
Caption: i said about the kinds of permissions

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:05.359
Caption: that we&#39;re granting when we use apps

02:14:02.719 --> 02:14:06.960
Caption: you also want to think about the extents

02:14:05.359 --> 02:14:08.959
Caption: to which you as a designer or a

02:14:06.959 --> 02:14:11.599
Caption: developer are actually going to

02:14:08.959 --> 02:14:14.159
Caption: influence the behavior of the people who

02:14:11.599 --> 02:14:16.479
Caption: use your app a really good example from

02:14:14.159 --> 02:14:20.800
Caption: of this comes from a book called stolen

02:14:16.479 --> 02:14:22.718
Caption: focus by johann hari this book looks at

02:14:20.799 --> 02:14:25.279
Caption: the different ways that our attention

02:14:22.719 --> 02:14:28.079
Caption: spans have actually reduced and it just

02:14:25.279 --> 02:14:31.439
Caption: looks at ways beyond just technology and

02:14:28.079 --> 02:14:33.359
Caption: beyond social media but it does have

02:14:31.439 --> 02:14:37.198
Caption: understandably quite a few chapters

02:14:33.359 --> 02:14:40.399
Caption: about social media and in it johan talks

02:14:37.199 --> 02:14:42.159
Caption: about the creator of the scroll feat

02:14:40.399 --> 02:14:44.079
Caption: and says that the creator of the scroll

02:14:42.159 --> 02:14:46.560
Caption: feed actually deeply regretted his

02:14:44.079 --> 02:14:47.760
Caption: decision and being a part of this

02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:49.839
Caption: creation

02:14:47.759 --> 02:14:52.879
Caption: and it did what it was supposed to it

02:14:49.839 --> 02:14:54.959
Caption: allowed kept people on on the app it

02:14:52.879 --> 02:14:57.359
Caption: kept people there for longer allowing

02:14:54.959 --> 02:14:58.879
Caption: them to collect more data sell more ads

02:14:57.359 --> 02:15:01.359
Caption: and make more money

02:14:58.879 --> 02:15:04.000
Caption: but it didn&#39;t respect effort that people

02:15:01.359 --> 02:15:06.718
Caption: were putting into being in that app

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.399
Caption: we compare this to netflix

02:15:06.719 --> 02:15:11.040
Caption: netflix after you&#39;ve watched a few

02:15:08.399 --> 02:15:12.959
Caption: episodes gives you a notification asking

02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:15.199
Caption: if you&#39;re still there it is thanks to

02:15:12.959 --> 02:15:18.319
Caption: this notification that ben makes it to

02:15:15.199 --> 02:15:18.320
Caption: bed on time at night

02:15:18.639 --> 02:15:24.000
Caption: so the last aspect we&#39;ve got is where we

02:15:21.599 --> 02:15:26.159
Caption: really see this link with human centered

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.520
Caption: design and that&#39;s creating positive

02:15:26.159 --> 02:15:29.599
Caption: experiences

02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:31.760
Caption: this is about the emotional connection

02:15:29.599 --> 02:15:34.719
Caption: people have with your product it should

02:15:31.759 --> 02:15:36.718
Caption: be delightful it should be intuitive and

02:15:34.719 --> 02:15:39.119
Caption: it should be invisible

02:15:36.719 --> 02:15:41.440
Caption: if your app works well

02:15:39.119 --> 02:15:44.000
Caption: i shouldn&#39;t notice the interactions i&#39;m

02:15:41.439 --> 02:15:46.399
Caption: having in it it should be that easy to

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:50.439
Caption: use if i&#39;m having to think about it

02:15:46.399 --> 02:15:50.439
Caption: you&#39;ve done something wrong

02:15:50.639 --> 02:15:55.119
Caption: now we can&#39;t consider ethics without

02:15:52.639 --> 02:15:56.639
Caption: also considering the wider community

02:15:55.119 --> 02:15:57.760
Caption: because ben is part of the bigger

02:15:56.639 --> 02:16:00.320
Caption: community

02:15:57.759 --> 02:16:03.039
Caption: our design has to focus on the entire

02:16:00.319 --> 02:16:05.678
Caption: activity under consideration not just

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:07.839
Caption: the smaller components you have and this

02:16:05.679 --> 02:16:10.959
Caption: is a reason why we all have terms like

02:16:07.839 --> 02:16:13.118
Caption: feature creep in our terminology

02:16:10.959 --> 02:16:14.959
Caption: ben is part of a much bigger system than

02:16:13.119 --> 02:16:18.399
Caption: your app he&#39;s part of the software

02:16:14.959 --> 02:16:21.520
Caption: community here in wa and in australia

02:16:18.399 --> 02:16:24.079
Caption: we need to be sensitive to the history

02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:25.919
Caption: and the culture and the beliefs of the

02:16:24.079 --> 02:16:28.560
Caption: structures and the community that we&#39;re

02:16:25.919 --> 02:16:29.520
Caption: designing for and you can&#39;t do this on

02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:31.760
Caption: your own

02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:34.240
Caption: even if you have a team of people whose

02:16:31.759 --> 02:16:36.638
Caption: job this is you cannot do this on your

02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:39.040
Caption: own you need to be talking to the

02:16:36.638 --> 02:16:41.040
Caption: community that are going to be involved

02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:43.518
Caption: in your app

02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:46.000
Caption: which means you can&#39;t just talk to ben

02:16:43.518 --> 02:16:48.159
Caption: ben is very privileged ben is white and

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:50.558
Caption: male ben has no ongoing health

02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:53.040
Caption: conditions ben&#39;s got a full-time job

02:16:50.558 --> 02:16:55.119
Caption: with a good salary ben has a bachelor

02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:56.879
Caption: degree he&#39;s paid off his hex debt

02:16:55.120 --> 02:17:00.879
Caption: something i&#39;m sure not many of us can

02:16:56.879 --> 02:17:03.280
Caption: say and ben is heterosexual and married

02:17:00.879 --> 02:17:05.518
Caption: being people-centered means you have to

02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:06.719
Caption: consider all of the people who are

02:17:05.518 --> 02:17:09.199
Caption: involved

02:17:06.718 --> 02:17:11.279
Caption: if we use healthcare as an example this

02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:13.120
Caption: means the patients this means the

02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:15.519
Caption: doctors the families the general

02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:18.399
Caption: practitioners specialists technicians

02:17:15.518 --> 02:17:21.759
Caption: nurses and the list goes on you need to

02:17:18.399 --> 02:17:24.559
Caption: think about everybody in that community

02:17:21.759 --> 02:17:26.080
Caption: now how do you actually do this

02:17:24.558 --> 02:17:28.080
Caption: well you does

02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:30.799
Caption: obvious solutions with connecting with

02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:33.519
Caption: stakeholders doing field interviews

02:17:30.799 --> 02:17:36.318
Caption: setting up meetings and going out and

02:17:33.518 --> 02:17:38.398
Caption: observing in the different industries

02:17:36.319 --> 02:17:41.040
Caption: and this can be costly

02:17:38.399 --> 02:17:43.599
Caption: i&#39;d like to note here that it&#39;s not as

02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:45.678
Caption: costly as spending a year developing

02:17:43.598 --> 02:17:47.598
Caption: something that the community doesn&#39;t

02:17:45.678 --> 02:17:49.919
Caption: actually want

02:17:47.598 --> 02:17:52.638
Caption: but you should also consider the ways

02:17:49.919 --> 02:17:54.879
Caption: you can use your current channels to be

02:17:52.638 --> 02:17:56.799
Caption: engaging in this process

02:17:54.879 --> 02:17:59.040
Caption: for example i always have an open

02:17:56.799 --> 02:18:00.799
Caption: communication channel that i invite

02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:03.598
Caption: stakeholders to

02:18:00.799 --> 02:18:06.240
Caption: and i can really quickly and easily drop

02:18:03.598 --> 02:18:08.799
Caption: in issues that we&#39;re having questions we

02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:10.718
Caption: might have and keep the community on

02:18:08.799 --> 02:18:12.638
Caption: board with the progress we&#39;re making in

02:18:10.718 --> 02:18:14.799
Caption: the app and those decisions that we&#39;re

02:18:12.638 --> 02:18:18.000
Caption: making so you could even be thinking

02:18:14.799 --> 02:18:20.080
Caption: about here how can you repurpose

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.718
Caption: the the technology and the systems

02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:24.959
Caption: already available to you that might mean

02:18:22.718 --> 02:18:27.358
Caption: making a dedicated channel and teams for

02:18:24.959 --> 02:18:28.718
Caption: example where you can invite some key

02:18:27.359 --> 02:18:31.760
Caption: stakeholders

02:18:28.718 --> 02:18:34.240
Caption: for me this part of the process is

02:18:31.759 --> 02:18:36.718
Caption: really important and i couldn&#39;t develop

02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:38.479
Caption: any work without having that open

02:18:36.718 --> 02:18:41.120
Caption: communication channel with the

02:18:38.478 --> 02:18:43.438
Caption: stakeholders involved

02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:45.919
Caption: so simply put we want to learn about the

02:18:43.439 --> 02:18:47.760
Caption: people that we&#39;re designing for and then

02:18:45.919 --> 02:18:49.598
Caption: we want to take time to make sense of

02:18:47.759 --> 02:18:51.438
Caption: what we&#39;ve learned and i&#39;ve got this as

02:18:49.598 --> 02:18:53.199
Caption: a separate point because we don&#39;t want

02:18:51.439 --> 02:18:54.240
Caption: to come in with assumptions about who

02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:56.479
Caption: ben is

02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:57.919
Caption: because ben&#39;s very unpredictable he&#39;ll

02:18:56.478 --> 02:18:59.199
Caption: surprise us

02:18:57.919 --> 02:19:01.200
Caption: we then want to

02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:04.080
Caption: look at opportunities for how we can

02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:07.040
Caption: prov improve people&#39;s lives and we want

02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:09.519
Caption: to do so ethically only then should we

02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:13.359
Caption: start prototyping while maintaining

02:19:09.518 --> 02:19:15.839
Caption: contact with our community stakeholders

02:19:13.359 --> 02:19:18.000
Caption: now some of you have caught on ben is a

02:19:15.839 --> 02:19:20.160
Caption: real person he&#39;s my husband and he&#39;s in

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.319
Caption: the front row here so let&#39;s all thank

02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:22.319
Caption: ben

02:19:24.959 --> 02:19:28.638
Caption: well i&#39;m not quite sure how i&#39;m going

02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:31.200
Caption: for time if there&#39;s any time for

02:19:28.638 --> 02:19:31.199
Caption: questions

02:19:34.799 --> 02:19:40.558
Caption: and ben is uh in uh on just after me by

02:19:38.638 --> 02:19:42.239
Caption: the way in the main theater so that&#39;s

02:19:40.558 --> 02:19:45.199
Caption: been running off to get ready for his

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:48.399
Caption: talk ben will be talking about offline

02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:51.600
Caption: mode offline first not offline mode uh

02:19:48.399 --> 02:19:51.600
Caption: in the lecture theater

02:19:54.959 --> 02:20:00.839
Caption: uh great talk uh congratulations uh for

02:19:58.559 --> 02:20:02.398
Caption: ben good sport

02:20:00.839 --> 02:20:05.040
Caption: um uh

02:20:02.399 --> 02:20:07.920
Caption: any tips on how to affect change within

02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:10.319
Caption: an organization on using inclusive

02:20:07.919 --> 02:20:12.559
Caption: language people when it&#39;s so ingrained

02:20:10.319 --> 02:20:14.720
Caption: in in that culture

02:20:12.559 --> 02:20:18.478
Caption: absolutely so this can be probably the

02:20:14.719 --> 02:20:21.200
Caption: toughest one i find uh simply so i write

02:20:18.478 --> 02:20:23.279
Caption: a lot of the reports myself and i&#39;ll

02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:26.319
Caption: actually use inclusive language in the

02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:28.240
Caption: reports that i am making so i very much

02:20:26.319 --> 02:20:30.160
Caption: try to push that from the point of view

02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:32.640
Caption: of the same as uh when i&#39;m in the

02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:35.280
Caption: classroom being the one that&#39;s making

02:20:32.639 --> 02:20:37.679
Caption: the change and setting that example

02:20:35.280 --> 02:20:39.919
Caption: there&#39;s other solutions such as actually

02:20:37.679 --> 02:20:41.919
Caption: getting community stakeholders in

02:20:39.919 --> 02:20:45.120
Caption: so i find that while that can be quite

02:20:41.919 --> 02:20:47.200
Caption: costly it can be really effective when

02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:49.759
Caption: people are being told about the

02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:51.839
Caption: importance of inclusive language from

02:20:49.759 --> 02:20:52.719
Caption: the people who are actually affected by

02:20:51.839 --> 02:20:54.719
Caption: it

02:20:52.719 --> 02:20:56.719
Caption: looking at healthcare as an example

02:20:54.719 --> 02:20:59.358
Caption: bringing people in who actually suffer

02:20:56.719 --> 02:21:02.000
Caption: from disabilities and talking about the

02:20:59.359 --> 02:21:04.399
Caption: way some language impacts them can

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:07.120
Caption: really change people&#39;s focus because it

02:21:04.399 --> 02:21:08.880
Caption: stops it from being an abstract term and

02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:10.240
Caption: that&#39;s the issue we have with language

02:21:08.879 --> 02:21:12.559
Caption: these terms they just feel really

02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:14.160
Caption: abstract we don&#39;t connect them to people

02:21:12.559 --> 02:21:16.879
Caption: when you&#39;re actually faced with the

02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:18.879
Caption: people you&#39;re using this terminology for

02:21:16.879 --> 02:21:21.438
Caption: it can be enough to start pushing for

02:21:18.879 --> 02:21:21.438
Caption: that change

02:21:21.519 --> 02:21:24.919
Caption: any other question

02:21:26.799 --> 02:21:36.740

02:26:34.559 --> 02:26:39.119

02:26:53.839 --> 02:26:57.519
Caption: confirm identities with passwords

02:26:55.759 --> 02:26:59.040

02:26:57.519 --> 02:27:00.639
Caption: like to use observer can do that yeah

02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:02.319
Caption: but it needs to be secure we can&#39;t have

02:27:00.639 --> 02:27:03.679
Caption: our app compromised by breaches not a

02:27:02.319 --> 02:27:05.040
Caption: problem and it needs to scale if we get

02:27:03.679 --> 02:27:07.040
Caption: hit with a ton of traffic and if it

02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:08.580
Caption: stalls or freezes up i will get fired we

02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:18.150

Caption: programming language

02:31:56.399 --> 02:32:01.760

02:31:58.959 --> 02:32:04.160
Caption: world troy is a software engineer with

Caption: sponsors who&#39;ve made this whole thing

02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:42.080
Caption: possible and also the volunteers and the

Caption: organizers

02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:45.280
Caption: one other thing

02:32:43.359 --> 02:32:47.600
Caption: to remember about ddd is that it&#39;s a

02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:48.799
Caption: democracy and that&#39;s a cool thing right

02:32:47.599 --> 02:32:50.000
Caption: but you know what the problem is with

02:32:48.799 --> 02:32:51.200
Caption: democracy

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:54.399
Caption: sometimes

02:32:51.200 --> 02:32:55.280
Caption: candidates uh make promises to get voted

02:32:54.399 --> 02:32:56.479
Caption: in

02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:58.240
Caption: and then they find that they can&#39;t

02:32:56.478 --> 02:33:01.199
Caption: deliver on their promises

02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:02.560
Caption: so when ddd called for submissions i was

02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:03.759
Caption: just thinking like what would be a cool

02:33:02.559 --> 02:33:05.358
Caption: talk what would be something interesting

02:33:03.759 --> 02:33:07.358
Caption: to go to i just sort of thought of this

02:33:05.359 --> 02:33:08.959
Caption: um there was a phrase that was popping

02:33:07.359 --> 02:33:10.319
Caption: up and i googled and i found okay was

02:33:08.959 --> 02:33:12.160
Caption: this phrase by wittgenstein a

02:33:10.319 --> 02:33:13.680
Caption: philosopher and he said the limits of my

02:33:12.160 --> 02:33:15.200
Caption: language mean the limits of my world and

02:33:13.679 --> 02:33:16.559
Caption: i thought wow that&#39;d be an interesting

02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:18.799
Caption: thing to think about with programming

02:33:16.559 --> 02:33:20.799
Caption: languages like are we actually stopping

02:33:18.799 --> 02:33:22.959
Caption: ourselves from doing a better job as a

02:33:20.799 --> 02:33:24.318
Caption: software industry because of limits in

02:33:22.959 --> 02:33:26.160
Caption: our programming language not being able

02:33:24.319 --> 02:33:28.399
Caption: to come up with better solutions or or

02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:29.679
Caption: less buggy solutions so i just

02:33:28.399 --> 02:33:31.600
Caption: shoved one word in there and i thought

02:33:29.679 --> 02:33:33.040
Caption: okay that&#39;s a nice catchy title all i

02:33:31.599 --> 02:33:34.318
Caption: need to do now is come up with a pitch

02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:36.000
Caption: and here&#39;s like a little summarized

02:33:34.319 --> 02:33:37.600
Caption: version if you don&#39;t remember it but i&#39;m

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:40.080
Caption: just saying like you know badly designed

02:33:37.599 --> 02:33:41.679
Caption: programming languages thought inhibitors

02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:43.679
Caption: are they part of the reason why we ship

02:33:41.679 --> 02:33:45.120
Caption: projects late and

02:33:43.679 --> 02:33:47.519
Caption: and with flaws

02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:49.120
Caption: so that&#39;s as far as i went unfortunately

02:33:47.519 --> 02:33:50.478
Caption: i delivered the promise but i didn&#39;t

02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:52.080
Caption: actually stop to think of what it would

02:33:50.478 --> 02:33:54.559
Caption: take to to

02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:56.799
Caption: to actually fulfill the promise so when

02:33:54.559 --> 02:33:58.239
Caption: my talk actually got selected i started

02:33:56.799 --> 02:34:01.599
Caption: to think about what the content would be

02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:03.359
Caption: for this talk and i thought oh crap

02:34:01.599 --> 02:34:04.639
Caption: anyway it&#39;s too late to change the pitch

02:34:03.359 --> 02:34:05.840
Caption: at that point

02:34:04.639 --> 02:34:07.279
Caption: and i didn&#39;t want to do a bait and

02:34:05.839 --> 02:34:08.719
Caption: switch because there&#39;s a lot of depth

02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:12.080
Caption: and a lot of breadth to this topic it

02:34:08.719 --> 02:34:14.160
Caption: turns out um so i could either just fly

02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:15.679
Caption: over the you know

02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:17.759
Caption: fly over the landscape and not really

02:34:15.679 --> 02:34:19.120
Caption: give much detail anywhere or i could

02:34:17.759 --> 02:34:20.398
Caption: deep dive into one thing but then i

02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:22.240
Caption: really feel like i&#39;d be breaking my

02:34:20.399 --> 02:34:25.120
Caption: promise which was to sort of cover a bit

02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:27.200
Caption: more broadly um in early feedback i gave

02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:28.719
Caption: this talk earlier a draft version of

02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:31.280
Caption: this and i got some really cool feedback

02:34:28.719 --> 02:34:33.519
Caption: and someone said this talk title could

02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:34.640
Caption: be the title of a whole tech conference

02:34:33.519 --> 02:34:36.318
Caption: you could have a whole tech conference

02:34:34.639 --> 02:34:38.799
Caption: about this and then people would go to

02:34:36.319 --> 02:34:40.080
Caption: the individual talks and focus on the

02:34:38.799 --> 02:34:42.080
Caption: different areas and i thought that&#39;s a

02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:44.240
Caption: cool idea and it actually gave me a way

02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:46.080
Caption: of thinking about what this talk that

02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:48.560
Caption: you&#39;ve come to would be this talk would

02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:50.399
Caption: be the keynote so imagine that we&#39;ve got

02:34:48.559 --> 02:34:53.119
Caption: a whole whole day to talk about this

02:34:50.399 --> 02:34:55.600
Caption: topic and this this talk then just means

02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:57.280
Caption: i can just kind of like go at 10 000

02:34:55.599 --> 02:34:58.799
Caption: meters over the landscape and just maybe

02:34:57.280 --> 02:35:00.080
Caption: point out a few little details here and

02:34:58.799 --> 02:35:02.080
Caption: there knowing that you know that&#39;s

02:35:00.080 --> 02:35:04.080
Caption: something that you can follow up in a in

02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:06.319
Caption: a in detail in another area all i can do

02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:09.520
Caption: is really just give it five minutes

02:35:06.319 --> 02:35:12.000
Caption: and just cover a whole lot of things

02:35:09.519 --> 02:35:13.599
Caption: so just at this high level we&#39;re talking

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:15.280
Caption: about programming languages and i

02:35:13.599 --> 02:35:17.279
Caption: thought that this this is a quote from a

02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:19.280
Caption: really great introductory textbook on

02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:21.040
Caption: functional programming by a couple of

02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:23.040
Caption: guys who are really influential in the

02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:24.240
Caption: ml community and developing camel in

02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:25.520
Caption: particular

02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:27.280
Caption: and they said the programming language

02:35:25.519 --> 02:35:29.599
Caption: we use influences our capacity as

02:35:27.280 --> 02:35:33.040
Caption: programmers to produce correct programs

02:35:29.599 --> 02:35:34.559
Caption: within a reasonable period of time and

02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:36.959
Caption: something implied in this we&#39;re not

02:35:34.559 --> 02:35:39.119
Caption: talking there&#39;s no problem with express

02:35:36.959 --> 02:35:40.478
Caption: being able to express solutions we can

02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:42.080
Caption: express solutions most of you have

02:35:40.478 --> 02:35:43.759
Caption: probably heard of during completeness it

02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:46.000
Caption: just means if something&#39;s true and

02:35:43.759 --> 02:35:47.759
Caption: complete you can compute absolutely

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:49.439
Caption: anything that is computable with with

02:35:47.759 --> 02:35:51.438
Caption: that device or that language or whatever

02:35:49.439 --> 02:35:53.120
Caption: it is and it&#39;s actually surprisingly low

02:35:51.439 --> 02:35:54.960
Caption: bar

02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:56.959
Caption: redstone blocks in minecraft are turing

02:35:54.959 --> 02:35:58.319
Caption: complete excel spreadsheets are cheering

02:35:56.959 --> 02:36:00.959
Caption: complete i just found out in a previous

02:35:58.319 --> 02:36:02.640
Caption: talk i went to that powerpoint slides

02:36:00.959 --> 02:36:04.160
Caption: are turing complete you could you could

02:36:02.639 --> 02:36:06.559
Caption: build your line of business application

02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:09.679
Caption: as a deck of powerpoint slides if you

02:36:06.559 --> 02:36:12.318
Caption: really wanted to um but we don&#39;t do that

02:36:09.679 --> 02:36:14.160
Caption: because but the two real key things are

02:36:12.319 --> 02:36:16.319
Caption: not can you build it it&#39;s that can you

02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:18.959
Caption: build it in a reasonable period of time

02:36:16.319 --> 02:36:20.319
Caption: and with few enough defects so these are

02:36:18.959 --> 02:36:22.478
Caption: the the two

02:36:20.319 --> 02:36:23.919
Caption: uh really important things so just to

02:36:22.478 --> 02:36:25.119
Caption: summarize those two things i&#39;ve just

02:36:23.919 --> 02:36:26.478
Caption: used the words convenience and

02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:28.719
Caption: correctness so these are kind of like

02:36:26.478 --> 02:36:29.679
Caption: the the themes that will come back again

02:36:28.719 --> 02:36:31.200
Caption: and again

02:36:29.679 --> 02:36:32.879
Caption: um

02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:36.080
Caption: the pictures you might be wondering what

02:36:32.879 --> 02:36:37.438
Caption: that&#39;s all about i went to another

02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:39.520
Caption: conference the other day that my work

02:36:37.439 --> 02:36:41.359
Caption: put on and i just heard this phrase

02:36:39.519 --> 02:36:44.079
Caption: dragons and rabbit holes and i thought

02:36:41.359 --> 02:36:45.200
Caption: hey that kind of applies so dragons like

02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:46.799
Caption: on the edge of the map there&#39;d be

02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:49.120
Caption: dragons right they&#39;re the things you

02:36:46.799 --> 02:36:50.639
Caption: want to avoid the bugs the the undefined

02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:52.879
Caption: behavior in your program so that&#39;s

02:36:50.639 --> 02:36:55.040
Caption: that&#39;s correctness

02:36:52.879 --> 02:36:56.719
Caption: rabbit holes is when in the context of

02:36:55.040 --> 02:36:58.719
Caption: programming languages it&#39;s really

02:36:56.719 --> 02:37:00.398
Caption: difficult to figure out how do i express

02:36:58.719 --> 02:37:01.919
Caption: the the problem that i&#39;m trying to solve

02:37:00.399 --> 02:37:03.760
Caption: in the language the language maybe it

02:37:01.919 --> 02:37:05.200
Caption: gives you no clear ways to do it and

02:37:03.759 --> 02:37:07.200
Caption: you&#39;ve got to build up all this stuff

02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:08.879
Caption: yourself or you&#39;re out there searching

02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:11.359
Caption: through half a dozen libraries that give

02:37:08.879 --> 02:37:13.839
Caption: you different trade-offs and so on so

02:37:11.359 --> 02:37:15.439
Caption: convenience is about how

02:37:13.839 --> 02:37:16.799
Caption: what&#39;s a reasonable amount of time to be

02:37:15.439 --> 02:37:18.800
Caption: able to come up with a good solution and

02:37:16.799 --> 02:37:21.120
Caption: how maintainable is that solution so

02:37:18.799 --> 02:37:24.160
Caption: these are the two sort of overarching

02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:24.160
Caption: themes that we come across

02:37:24.319 --> 02:37:27.359
Caption: um

02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:29.359
Caption: just to briefly go on those actually i i

02:37:27.359 --> 02:37:30.479
Caption: think for time i won&#39;t go into details

02:37:29.359 --> 02:37:32.479
Caption: but some of you may have heard of the

02:37:30.478 --> 02:37:35.279
Caption: sapir wharf hypothesis so convenience is

02:37:32.478 --> 02:37:37.358
Caption: really about this idea that that limits

02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:39.359
Caption: in what language you what your language

02:37:37.359 --> 02:37:40.640
Caption: can express i mean you know limits in

02:37:39.359 --> 02:37:42.080
Caption: what you can actually do so it&#39;s

02:37:40.639 --> 02:37:43.839
Caption: language as a thought tool it can

02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:46.000
Caption: basically multiply your powers or it

02:37:43.839 --> 02:37:47.839
Caption: could divide your powers

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:50.319
Caption: so this is the effort to express

02:37:47.839 --> 02:37:52.639
Caption: requirements as a as a program using a

02:37:50.319 --> 02:37:54.319
Caption: programming language so the the the

02:37:52.639 --> 02:37:55.839
Caption: general thing with convenience is that

02:37:54.319 --> 02:37:57.280
Caption: we seem to be suggesting that we want

02:37:55.839 --> 02:37:58.398
Caption: more flexibility and we want rich

02:37:57.280 --> 02:38:00.720
Caption: language because that&#39;s going to make it

02:37:58.399 --> 02:38:03.680
Caption: more convenient on the other side

02:38:00.719 --> 02:38:06.000
Caption: correctness the safety of being able to

02:38:03.679 --> 02:38:07.839
Caption: express things in a program

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.559
Caption: the the set of possible programs that

02:38:07.839 --> 02:38:12.959
Caption: exist out there is huge right probably

02:38:10.559 --> 02:38:14.478
Caption: infinite definitely infinite but a lot

02:38:12.959 --> 02:38:16.080
Caption: of those programs that we could possibly

02:38:14.478 --> 02:38:17.759
Caption: express they&#39;re subtly wrong they might

02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:20.080
Caption: be almost the right solution but not

02:38:17.759 --> 02:38:21.679
Caption: quite but we can still express them so

02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:23.839
Caption: if this sort of implies that we want

02:38:21.679 --> 02:38:26.080
Caption: less expressiveness we want to basically

02:38:23.839 --> 02:38:27.599
Caption: cut off avenues towards expressing

02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:28.799
Caption: programs that are wrong that are subtly

02:38:27.599 --> 02:38:31.279
Caption: wrong

02:38:28.799 --> 02:38:33.438
Caption: for example some soft some programming

02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:35.280
Caption: languages allow you to express memory

02:38:33.439 --> 02:38:37.280
Caption: management explicitly

02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:38.479
Caption: but they introduce the dangers because

02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:40.000
Caption: of that because they allow you to

02:38:38.478 --> 02:38:41.679
Caption: express all the incorrect patterns of

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.799
Caption: memory management as well

02:38:41.679 --> 02:38:44.719
Caption: on the other hand you&#39;ve got languages

02:38:42.799 --> 02:38:46.639
Caption: like java or c-sharp that have automatic

02:38:44.719 --> 02:38:47.919
Caption: memory management you cannot express

02:38:46.639 --> 02:38:48.879
Caption: memory management patterns it doesn&#39;t

02:38:47.919 --> 02:38:50.799
Caption: let you do it it just does it

02:38:48.879 --> 02:38:53.679
Caption: automatically so it&#39;s less expressive

02:38:50.799 --> 02:38:53.679
Caption: but it&#39;s more correct

02:38:53.839 --> 02:38:58.398
Caption: so if this was a

02:38:55.599 --> 02:39:01.519
Caption: fictional conference pl conf 22 this

02:38:58.399 --> 02:39:03.359
Caption: would be the the billing of the talks so

02:39:01.519 --> 02:39:04.879
Caption: i&#39;m going to talk just briefly about a

02:39:03.359 --> 02:39:07.359
Caption: bunch of topics here basically some

02:39:04.879 --> 02:39:09.120
Caption: fundamentals at the beginning

02:39:07.359 --> 02:39:10.240
Caption: this general

02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:11.919
Caption: theme that i want to bring out that

02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:15.839
Caption: programming languages are for humans and

02:39:11.919 --> 02:39:17.599
Caption: then a couple of deep dives at the end

02:39:15.839 --> 02:39:19.839
Caption: all right getting started on the first

02:39:17.599 --> 02:39:22.559
Caption: one

02:39:19.839 --> 02:39:24.559
Caption: just about motivation

02:39:22.559 --> 02:39:25.759
Caption: why would we care about programming

02:39:24.559 --> 02:39:26.879
Caption: language design does it really matter in

02:39:25.759 --> 02:39:28.160
Caption: the real world

02:39:26.879 --> 02:39:31.280
Caption: so

02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:32.560
Caption: mark anderson about 10 years ago

02:39:31.280 --> 02:39:34.319
Caption: put out a paper

02:39:32.559 --> 02:39:35.839
Caption: an article that was quite well known

02:39:34.319 --> 02:39:37.359
Caption: wall street journal software is eating

02:39:35.839 --> 02:39:39.519
Caption: the world and he was just pointing out

02:39:37.359 --> 02:39:41.680
Caption: how we&#39;ve just got this unprecedented

02:39:39.519 --> 02:39:44.559
Caption: and growing uh global dependence on

02:39:41.679 --> 02:39:45.759
Caption: software systems uh there&#39;s some just

02:39:44.559 --> 02:39:47.279
Caption: look at the companies that i&#39;ve listed

02:39:45.759 --> 02:39:49.120
Caption: there think about what they&#39;ve how

02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:52.080
Caption: they&#39;ve transformed our economy so

02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:53.839
Caption: bookshops amazon comes along the the

02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:56.560
Caption: global book industry is now basically a

02:39:53.839 --> 02:39:58.000
Caption: software industry uh uber uber doesn&#39;t

02:39:56.559 --> 02:40:00.000
Caption: have taxis they don&#39;t have their own

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:01.679
Caption: drivers they&#39;re basically they have an

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Caption: app and they have a bunch of software

02:40:01.679 --> 02:40:07.279
Caption: running on the back end and and that&#39;s

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:09.120
Caption: the the global company um so more and

02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:11.520
Caption: more of the global economy is actually

02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:14.000
Caption: software it&#39;s built and and runs off of

02:40:11.519 --> 02:40:16.639
Caption: software so this also implies that

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:19.439
Caption: there&#39;s these growing and huge risk and

02:40:16.639 --> 02:40:21.839
Caption: reward multipliers because so much of

02:40:19.439 --> 02:40:24.000
Caption: what of our economic everyday activity

02:40:21.839 --> 02:40:26.080
Caption: is mediated through software

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:27.759
Caption: so if you can increase the convenience

02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:29.759
Caption: of being able to create that software

02:40:27.759 --> 02:40:32.639
Caption: more quickly or more reliably uh you

02:40:29.759 --> 02:40:34.318
Caption: might have a great competitive advantage

02:40:32.639 --> 02:40:36.559
Caption: equally if you can improve the

02:40:34.319 --> 02:40:38.080
Caption: correctness because of new patterns in

02:40:36.559 --> 02:40:40.478
Caption: in programming languages that just you

02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:41.520
Caption: know block off avenues of expressing

02:40:40.478 --> 02:40:43.199
Caption: bugs

02:40:41.519 --> 02:40:44.879
Caption: you might experience less hacks less

02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:46.000
Caption: exploits and less failures which is also

02:40:44.879 --> 02:40:49.280
Caption: going to be

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:51.679
Caption: good so i&#39;m not suggesting that um

02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:53.359
Caption: programming languages are the only

02:40:51.679 --> 02:40:55.358
Caption: problem for

02:40:53.359 --> 02:40:56.640
Caption: improving our productivity with software

02:40:55.359 --> 02:40:58.160
Caption: they&#39;re probably not even the major

02:40:56.639 --> 02:40:59.679
Caption: factor because we&#39;ve got people and

02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:01.280
Caption: we&#39;ve got processors and that&#39;s usually

02:40:59.679 --> 02:41:03.279
Caption: where you look if you want to make

02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:05.359
Caption: things more efficient

02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:07.040
Caption: but i i don&#39;t think it&#39;s zero i think

02:41:05.359 --> 02:41:08.800
Caption: that i what i&#39;d like to demonstrate

02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:11.120
Caption: today is that programming languages

02:41:08.799 --> 02:41:12.240
Caption: themselves can shift the needle on

02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:13.600
Caption: things that are actually important in

02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:15.200
Caption: the real world

02:41:13.599 --> 02:41:16.799
Caption: and even if it&#39;s a small amount we&#39;re

02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:18.879
Caption: talking a huge numbers here right so

02:41:16.799 --> 02:41:20.559
Caption: it&#39;s still a huge number

02:41:18.879 --> 02:41:22.478
Caption: so the question is what about these

02:41:20.559 --> 02:41:24.318
Caption: numbers like are we doing fine as a

02:41:22.478 --> 02:41:25.919
Caption: software industry or aren&#39;t we so it&#39;s

02:41:24.319 --> 02:41:27.439
Caption: not hard to actually just like troll the

02:41:25.919 --> 02:41:29.839
Caption: internet and look for examples look for

02:41:27.439 --> 02:41:30.960
Caption: studies i just listed a whole bunch here

02:41:29.839 --> 02:41:33.120
Caption: i&#39;m not going to go through all of these

02:41:30.959 --> 02:41:35.120
Caption: but just you can see the the general

02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:37.359
Caption: size of the numbers so the capital t is

02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:39.759
Caption: trillion um there&#39;s studies there that

02:41:37.359 --> 02:41:42.319
Caption: are just estimating the cost of software

02:41:39.759 --> 02:41:44.559
Caption: failures in the us alone at something

02:41:42.319 --> 02:41:47.200
Caption: like 2 trillion dollars a year which is

02:41:44.559 --> 02:41:49.519
Caption: like 10 of the economy um even if the

02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:51.520
Caption: estimates are way off even if they&#39;re

02:41:49.519 --> 02:41:53.679
Caption: vaguely in the ballpark it&#39;s that we&#39;re

02:41:51.519 --> 02:41:55.438
Caption: talking really huge numbers

02:41:53.679 --> 02:41:56.639
Caption: um there&#39;s lots of other things there

02:41:55.439 --> 02:41:58.479
Caption: that are easy to find if you&#39;re

02:41:56.639 --> 02:42:00.159
Caption: interested there&#39;s also really

02:41:58.478 --> 02:42:02.398
Caption: interesting individual examples and i&#39;ll

02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:05.200
Caption: just highlight this therap-25 back in

02:42:02.399 --> 02:42:08.640
Caption: the 80s was a medical device

02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:11.520
Caption: i believe for taking x-rays of patients

02:42:08.639 --> 02:42:13.199
Caption: and injuries and deaths were involved so

02:42:11.519 --> 02:42:14.318
Caption: that was a combined hardware software

02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:15.680
Caption: system that they wrote their own

02:42:14.319 --> 02:42:17.439
Caption: software for that system the company

02:42:15.679 --> 02:42:19.519
Caption: that released it it had preemptive

02:42:17.439 --> 02:42:20.800
Caption: multitasking it was basically written in

02:42:19.519 --> 02:42:22.639
Caption: assembly language and it also had

02:42:20.799 --> 02:42:24.318
Caption: mutable shared state so the language

02:42:22.639 --> 02:42:25.599
Caption: they were using didn&#39;t protect against

02:42:24.319 --> 02:42:27.840
Caption: any of those things it was all up to the

02:42:25.599 --> 02:42:29.279
Caption: the programmers to be able to spot their

02:42:27.839 --> 02:42:30.959
Caption: own errors

02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:32.879
Caption: and in all their test suites everything

02:42:30.959 --> 02:42:35.120
Caption: worked fine because they tested it in

02:42:32.879 --> 02:42:36.799
Caption: test conditions had no problems

02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:37.919
Caption: eventually they actually injured and

02:42:36.799 --> 02:42:39.438
Caption: killed

02:42:37.919 --> 02:42:41.359
Caption: a number of people

02:42:39.439 --> 02:42:42.960
Caption: because certain operators using that

02:42:41.359 --> 02:42:44.240
Caption: machine typed a bit too fast at the

02:42:42.959 --> 02:42:46.319
Caption: wrong time and that triggered a race

02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:47.919
Caption: condition in their code

02:42:46.319 --> 02:42:49.600
Caption: and they didn&#39;t admit it for a long time

02:42:47.919 --> 02:42:51.759
Caption: because they couldn&#39;t reproduce it but

02:42:49.599 --> 02:42:54.559
Caption: that was definitely an issue that could

02:42:51.759 --> 02:42:56.398
Caption: be resolved with a different choice of

02:42:54.559 --> 02:42:57.759
Caption: programming language

02:42:56.399 --> 02:43:00.319
Caption: so that&#39;s just one example and there&#39;s

02:42:57.759 --> 02:43:02.559
Caption: others there as well

02:43:00.319 --> 02:43:04.160
Caption: it&#39;s also easy to come across articles

02:43:02.559 --> 02:43:05.919
Caption: like this so microsoft did an internal

02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:07.839
Caption: study and found that 70 of their

02:43:05.919 --> 02:43:09.200
Caption: security bugs are memory safety issues

02:43:07.839 --> 02:43:11.200
Caption: and in that article they particularly

02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:14.319
Caption: highlight that a lot of the software

02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:16.319
Caption: involves written in c and c plus plus

02:43:14.319 --> 02:43:17.760
Caption: memory unsafe languages where one slip

02:43:16.319 --> 02:43:20.080
Caption: up in the developer&#39;s memory management

02:43:17.759 --> 02:43:21.679
Caption: code can lead to a slew of memory safety

02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:22.879
Caption: errors that attackers can exploit with

02:43:21.679 --> 02:43:25.358
Caption: dangerous and

02:43:22.879 --> 02:43:28.478
Caption: intrusive consequences so that&#39;s really

02:43:25.359 --> 02:43:30.399
Caption: sheeting home uh consequences directly

02:43:28.478 --> 02:43:31.759
Caption: to the programming language choice

02:43:30.399 --> 02:43:33.520
Caption: itself

02:43:31.759 --> 02:43:34.879
Caption: so just to sum up that section

02:43:33.519 --> 02:43:37.759
Caption: programming language design definitely

02:43:34.879 --> 02:43:38.639
Caption: does have real world consequences

02:43:37.759 --> 02:43:40.000
Caption: okay

02:43:38.639 --> 02:43:41.599
Caption: another one of these topics that we

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:43.040
Caption: would fly over in this conference would

02:43:41.599 --> 02:43:44.639
Caption: be that there&#39;s never going to be one

02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:47.919
Caption: programming language to rule them all

02:43:44.639 --> 02:43:49.120
Caption: wouldn&#39;t it it&#39;d be nice right um but

02:43:47.919 --> 02:43:51.438
Caption: well

02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:52.799
Caption: here&#39;s a picture of uh each of those

02:43:51.439 --> 02:43:54.240
Caption: little words it doesn&#39;t matter they&#39;re

02:43:52.799 --> 02:43:55.679
Caption: too small to read but they&#39;re all names

02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:57.359
Caption: of programming languages and the little

02:43:55.679 --> 02:43:59.199
Caption: lines between them basically trace

02:43:57.359 --> 02:44:01.200
Caption: influence and we&#39;re going down the page

02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:02.479
Caption: so we&#39;re back in the 70s at the top and

02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:04.719
Caption: we&#39;re down to

02:44:02.478 --> 02:44:05.919
Caption: a few years ago at the bottom

02:44:04.719 --> 02:44:07.679
Caption: anyway i don&#39;t know about you but i

02:44:05.919 --> 02:44:09.279
Caption: don&#39;t really see much sense of

02:44:07.679 --> 02:44:12.879
Caption: convergence

02:44:09.279 --> 02:44:14.399
Caption: in here um it&#39;s and also it seems like

02:44:12.879 --> 02:44:16.080
Caption: ideas have been around for a long time

02:44:14.399 --> 02:44:17.439
Caption: and they influence they they go away

02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:20.799
Caption: they come back

02:44:17.439 --> 02:44:22.479
Caption: so consensus in programming languages

02:44:20.799 --> 02:44:23.759
Caption: doesn&#39;t seem to really be there so why

02:44:22.478 --> 02:44:26.639
Caption: is that

02:44:23.759 --> 02:44:28.240
Caption: it&#39;s not for lack of trying

02:44:26.639 --> 02:44:30.159
Caption: so

02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:31.919
Caption: the the current candidate for the one

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:34.000
Caption: programming language to rule them all in

02:44:31.919 --> 02:44:35.599
Caption: many people&#39;s views is javascript and at

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:37.040
Caption: would even make law about what he

02:44:35.599 --> 02:44:38.159
Caption: claimed you know to be a law that

02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:39.679
Caption: anything that can be written in

02:44:38.160 --> 02:44:42.399
Caption: javascript will eventually be written in

02:44:39.679 --> 02:44:44.799
Caption: javascript and on the far side on my

02:44:42.399 --> 02:44:46.240
Caption: on the right hand side there uh it

02:44:44.799 --> 02:44:48.160
Caption: probably too small to read but just

02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:49.839
Caption: gives you a glimpse this is the tc39

02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:51.279
Caption: committee that decides what things are

02:44:49.839 --> 02:44:53.040
Caption: going to make it into the next version

02:44:51.279 --> 02:44:55.600
Caption: of javascript and pretty much everyone

02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:57.040
Caption: this is this is like a third of just

02:44:55.599 --> 02:44:58.559
Caption: what fits on a screen it goes down and

02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:00.559
Caption: these are only stage one proposals they

02:44:58.559 --> 02:45:02.318
Caption: also have stage zero stage one two three

02:45:00.559 --> 02:45:04.559
Caption: and then four means it&#39;s in the language

02:45:02.319 --> 02:45:06.640
Caption: so basically every everybody is trying

02:45:04.559 --> 02:45:08.159
Caption: to get the language to do their thing so

02:45:06.639 --> 02:45:09.438
Caption: you know it&#39;s not like we don&#39;t want

02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:12.560
Caption: there to be one language to rule them

02:45:09.439 --> 02:45:15.760
Caption: all um this is not new so tony hawe who

02:45:12.559 --> 02:45:18.959
Caption: gave us quicksort um he also gave us

02:45:15.759 --> 02:45:20.639
Caption: nulls the billion-dollar mistake uh he&#39;s

02:45:18.959 --> 02:45:21.919
Caption: a quote from a paper that he wrote he

02:45:20.639 --> 02:45:24.239
Caption: was he says we were charged with the

02:45:21.919 --> 02:45:26.398
Caption: standardization of a language to end all

02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:27.839
Caption: languages designed to meet the needs of

02:45:26.399 --> 02:45:30.319
Caption: all computer applications both

02:45:27.839 --> 02:45:33.839
Caption: commercial and scientific and that was

02:45:30.319 --> 02:45:35.680
Caption: in the 1960s in reference to pli which

02:45:33.839 --> 02:45:37.438
Caption: most of you including me have probably

02:45:35.679 --> 02:45:39.278
Caption: never even seen

02:45:37.439 --> 02:45:41.600
Caption: let alone worked on so i guess that

02:45:39.279 --> 02:45:42.640
Caption: didn&#39;t work out either

02:45:41.599 --> 02:45:44.318
Caption: um

02:45:42.639 --> 02:45:45.839
Caption: the problem really comes down to the

02:45:44.319 --> 02:45:47.439
Caption: fact that there&#39;s competing goals in

02:45:45.839 --> 02:45:48.719
Caption: programming language design so i&#39;m not

02:45:47.439 --> 02:45:50.080
Caption: going to go through all of these but

02:45:48.719 --> 02:45:51.919
Caption: just to give you an idea there&#39;s just

02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:54.240
Caption: some i just hammered out just

02:45:51.919 --> 02:45:55.919
Caption: i think a lot of them would be make

02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:56.959
Caption: sense but i&#39;ll give you one illustration

02:45:55.919 --> 02:45:58.559
Caption: so

02:45:56.959 --> 02:46:01.438
Caption: going back to this example with memory

02:45:58.559 --> 02:46:03.599
Caption: safety um that&#39;s relevant here

02:46:01.439 --> 02:46:05.600
Caption: so some trade-offs here so for example

02:46:03.599 --> 02:46:06.719
Caption: if you you have a fresh new application

02:46:05.599 --> 02:46:09.519
Caption: you need to develop and you&#39;re trying to

02:46:06.719 --> 02:46:12.559
Caption: choose which language to use

02:46:09.519 --> 02:46:14.159
Caption: if you had absolute real-time

02:46:12.559 --> 02:46:16.318
Caption: performance requirements where you

02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:18.560
Caption: cannot stand um garbage collection

02:46:16.319 --> 02:46:20.479
Caption: pauses let&#39;s say so you&#39;re on the side

02:46:18.559 --> 02:46:22.639
Caption: of having to have absolute performance

02:46:20.478 --> 02:46:24.079
Caption: there is a trade-off uh there in the

02:46:22.639 --> 02:46:26.000
Caption: sense that you probably wouldn&#39;t want to

02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:27.919
Caption: use java and c-sharp because they do

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:31.759
Caption: automatic memory management at the cost

02:46:27.919 --> 02:46:33.279
Caption: of some stuttering some pauses and um

02:46:31.759 --> 02:46:35.438
Caption: just unpredictable

02:46:33.279 --> 02:46:37.200
Caption: performance so

02:46:35.439 --> 02:46:39.760
Caption: you would probably want to go on the

02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:41.839
Caption: c-plus plus or rust side because you can

02:46:39.759 --> 02:46:43.438
Caption: actually literally control

02:46:41.839 --> 02:46:45.279
Caption: the memory management in the programming

02:46:43.439 --> 02:46:47.279
Caption: language itself

02:46:45.279 --> 02:46:49.839
Caption: on the other hand is there a trade-off

02:46:47.279 --> 02:46:53.600
Caption: let&#39;s say at the bottom between

02:46:49.839 --> 02:46:56.240
Caption: java and rust so if if we choose rust

02:46:53.599 --> 02:46:58.879
Caption: because it&#39;s really safe with memory uh

02:46:56.240 --> 02:47:00.560
Caption: why why would we always choose rust well

02:46:58.879 --> 02:47:01.759
Caption: maybe performance isn&#39;t the the top

02:47:00.559 --> 02:47:03.919
Caption: thing maybe it&#39;s just speed of

02:47:01.759 --> 02:47:05.358
Caption: development and i&#39;m not a super

02:47:03.919 --> 02:47:07.200
Caption: proficient rust developer but having

02:47:05.359 --> 02:47:08.640
Caption: looked around i can see that you know a

02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:10.240
Caption: lot of people say it&#39;s not that

02:47:08.639 --> 02:47:11.358
Caption: straightforward to satisfy the borrower

02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:13.359
Caption: checker you&#39;ve got to do it you&#39;ve got

02:47:11.359 --> 02:47:15.840
Caption: to really understand what you&#39;re doing

02:47:13.359 --> 02:47:18.000
Caption: in a non-trivial application so why

02:47:15.839 --> 02:47:20.160
Caption: would you even put that barrier in front

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:22.240
Caption: of your team of software developers if

02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:24.080
Caption: absolute real-time performance wasn&#39;t an

02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:26.399
Caption: issue maybe you&#39;re just developing a

02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:27.919
Caption: simple app for your own use or i don&#39;t

02:47:26.399 --> 02:47:29.920
Caption: know there&#39;s lots of situations where

02:47:27.919 --> 02:47:31.759
Caption: you might not have that requirement so

02:47:29.919 --> 02:47:33.359
Caption: there&#39;s a trade-off there it&#39;s it&#39;s

02:47:31.759 --> 02:47:35.519
Caption: harder to get the thing up and running

02:47:33.359 --> 02:47:37.439
Caption: and shipped in rust than it would be in

02:47:35.519 --> 02:47:38.879
Caption: java and c-sharp so it really depends on

02:47:37.439 --> 02:47:40.720
Caption: whether you have that performance

02:47:38.879 --> 02:47:45.279
Caption: requirement or not so that&#39;s just some

02:47:40.719 --> 02:47:48.000
Caption: examples of trade-offs okay moving on

02:47:45.279 --> 02:47:51.040
Caption: this section would be about

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:53.359
Caption: essential and accidental complexity so

02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:55.520
Caption: this concept came from fred books brooks

02:47:53.359 --> 02:47:58.160
Caption: who gave us the book the mythical man

02:47:55.519 --> 02:48:00.559
Caption: month so back in the 80s he also wrote

02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:02.240
Caption: his paper called no silver bullet and he

02:48:00.559 --> 02:48:04.799
Caption: he gave us this nice way of thinking

02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:06.560
Caption: about software systems as uh having two

02:48:04.799 --> 02:48:09.358
Caption: kinds of complexity in them essential

02:48:06.559 --> 02:48:11.278
Caption: complexity and accidental complexity so

02:48:09.359 --> 02:48:12.880
Caption: essential complexity in software is

02:48:11.279 --> 02:48:14.800
Caption: basically the stuff you can&#39;t get rid of

02:48:12.879 --> 02:48:16.478
Caption: because it&#39;s the spec it&#39;s like here

02:48:14.799 --> 02:48:18.318
Caption: here&#39;s the spec please go and implement

02:48:16.478 --> 02:48:20.559
Caption: a program that does this that does what

02:48:18.319 --> 02:48:22.160
Caption: it says so if it&#39;s in the spec

02:48:20.559 --> 02:48:23.759
Caption: and the specs complicated that&#39;s

02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:25.359
Caption: essential complexity if it says you&#39;ve

02:48:23.759 --> 02:48:27.438
Caption: got to do those 25 things you&#39;ve got to

02:48:25.359 --> 02:48:29.359
Caption: do those 25 things if it says you have

02:48:27.439 --> 02:48:32.000
Caption: to interface with three wildly

02:48:29.359 --> 02:48:34.240
Caption: incompatible terribly written external

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.759
Caption: systems that&#39;s an essential thing

02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:38.399
Caption: because that&#39;s what&#39;s in the spec right

02:48:35.759 --> 02:48:40.000
Caption: so you can&#39;t avoid it um accidental

02:48:38.399 --> 02:48:41.279
Caption: complexity on the other hand is stuff

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.200
Caption: that still makes it difficult and

02:48:41.279 --> 02:48:44.800
Caption: complex they&#39;re just basically unhelpful

02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:46.959
Caption: barriers to expressing a working

02:48:44.799 --> 02:48:49.040
Caption: solution but they&#39;re not inherent in the

02:48:46.959 --> 02:48:51.359
Caption: spec so for example

02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:53.439
Caption: uh manual memory management if you&#39;re

02:48:51.359 --> 02:48:55.200
Caption: thinking about managing your memory but

02:48:53.439 --> 02:48:57.520
Caption: the spec just says well we need this

02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:59.040
Caption: this mobile app for the customer that&#39;s

02:48:57.519 --> 02:49:00.799
Caption: accidental complexity it&#39;s just

02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:03.359
Caption: something you you have to do on top of

02:49:00.799 --> 02:49:06.080
Caption: solving the the essential problem

02:49:03.359 --> 02:49:08.080
Caption: and choosing different tools can affect

02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:12.240
Caption: how much accidental complexity makes up

02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:13.679
Caption: the the overall complexity of your job

02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:14.959
Caption: so

02:49:13.679 --> 02:49:16.080
Caption: essential complexity sounds like

02:49:14.959 --> 02:49:17.839
Caption: something you can&#39;t get rid of i just

02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:19.040
Caption: wanted to briefly mention that it&#39;s not

02:49:17.839 --> 02:49:20.959
Caption: actually true

02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:23.040
Caption: you can reduce essential complexity but

02:49:20.959 --> 02:49:25.279
Caption: with another trade-off so if you think

02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:27.279
Caption: about domain specific languages or even

02:49:25.279 --> 02:49:28.720
Caption: visual programming languages they tend

02:49:27.279 --> 02:49:30.640
Caption: to be

02:49:28.719 --> 02:49:32.559
Caption: reduce essential complexity by allowing

02:49:30.639 --> 02:49:34.239
Caption: you to state things at a higher level

02:49:32.559 --> 02:49:35.679
Caption: you can quickly say

02:49:34.240 --> 02:49:38.319
Caption: how you want things to be done so for

02:49:35.679 --> 02:49:39.438
Caption: example sql for data access so we don&#39;t

02:49:38.319 --> 02:49:41.359
Caption: write

02:49:39.439 --> 02:49:43.120
Caption: python generally for

02:49:41.359 --> 02:49:44.720
Caption: doing database queries on a relational

02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:46.639
Caption: database we write sql and it&#39;s really

02:49:44.719 --> 02:49:49.120
Caption: quick and it gets the job done but it&#39;s

02:49:46.639 --> 02:49:51.759
Caption: basically a domain specific language or

02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:53.600
Caption: a dsl for that one job so it sacrifices

02:49:51.759 --> 02:49:56.000
Caption: generality but it means you can do that

02:49:53.599 --> 02:49:57.839
Caption: one job well so that&#39;s great there&#39;s

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:59.839
Caption: languages that do things regex would be

02:49:57.839 --> 02:50:01.599
Caption: another example there&#39;s lots of them but

02:49:59.839 --> 02:50:03.040
Caption: they don&#39;t solve the general problem

02:50:01.599 --> 02:50:04.398
Caption: it&#39;s not like if you&#39;re given a brief

02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:06.319
Caption: that you&#39;ve got to develop a whole app

02:50:04.399 --> 02:50:07.760
Caption: you you go for the specific dsl that

02:50:06.319 --> 02:50:09.040
Caption: probably isn&#39;t one in most cases you

02:50:07.759 --> 02:50:11.200
Caption: need a general language so you can&#39;t

02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:13.120
Caption: always make this trade-off

02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:14.319
Caption: um on the other hand accidental

02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:15.120
Caption: complexity

02:50:14.319 --> 02:50:16.399
Caption: so

02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:18.240
Caption: we still you know there&#39;s things like

02:50:16.399 --> 02:50:19.520
Caption: boilerplate code if you have to if

02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:21.600
Caption: you&#39;re writing your app if you have to

02:50:19.519 --> 02:50:23.039
Caption: think about managing memory yourself or

02:50:21.599 --> 02:50:25.278
Caption: managing concurrency managing

02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:26.240
Caption: dependencies managing versions these

02:50:25.279 --> 02:50:27.279
Caption: aren&#39;t things that are in the spec

02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:28.799
Caption: they&#39;re just things that you&#39;ve got to

02:50:27.279 --> 02:50:30.800
Caption: get right and they just they&#39;re just

02:50:28.799 --> 02:50:31.599
Caption: unhelpful barriers that get in your way

02:50:30.799 --> 02:50:33.839
Caption: um

02:50:31.599 --> 02:50:36.239
Caption: brooks in no silver bullet interestingly

02:50:33.839 --> 02:50:38.559
Caption: says we&#39;ve already solved the accidental

02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:40.080
Caption: complexity problem for the most part

02:50:38.559 --> 02:50:41.919
Caption: that&#39;s that was his view back in the

02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:44.240
Caption: 1980s um

02:50:41.919 --> 02:50:47.200
Caption: i don&#39;t know if any of you uh have can

02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:49.120
Caption: think of what he said was the number one

02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:51.279
Caption: thing that made the biggest difference

02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:53.919
Caption: in accident in solving accidental

02:50:51.279 --> 02:50:53.919
Caption: complexity

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Caption: so

02:50:55.040 --> 02:50:59.120
Caption: the thing that made the biggest

02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:01.200
Caption: difference was in his uh view high-level

02:50:59.120 --> 02:51:02.719
Caption: language so high-level language just

02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:04.319
Caption: means now this is something we

02:51:02.719 --> 02:51:06.719
Caption: completely take for granted when you

02:51:04.319 --> 02:51:08.319
Caption: write program code in in any programming

02:51:06.719 --> 02:51:10.879
Caption: language that we use today pretty much

02:51:08.319 --> 02:51:12.720
Caption: you are writing code using for example

02:51:10.879 --> 02:51:14.160
Caption: english keywords it&#39;s human

02:51:12.719 --> 02:51:16.080
Caption: understandable it&#39;s written in a high

02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:18.399
Caption: level you can kind of see that the loops

02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:19.919
Caption: and the conditions in the code

02:51:18.399 --> 02:51:21.840
Caption: and it&#39;s translated down to something

02:51:19.919 --> 02:51:23.519
Caption: that the machine can understand so

02:51:21.839 --> 02:51:25.599
Caption: that&#39;s what we mean by high langu high

02:51:23.519 --> 02:51:27.919
Caption: language high level language it&#39;s that

02:51:25.599 --> 02:51:30.318
Caption: the code is independent of the machine

02:51:27.919 --> 02:51:31.599
Caption: that is going to run it the the specific

02:51:30.319 --> 02:51:32.800
Caption: things the machine has to do they&#39;re not

02:51:31.599 --> 02:51:35.519
Caption: represented there in the language that&#39;s

02:51:32.799 --> 02:51:37.358
Caption: high level language um he estimates that

02:51:35.519 --> 02:51:39.119
Caption: that gave us a five times productivity

02:51:37.359 --> 02:51:40.720
Caption: boost so i thought it would be

02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:42.479
Caption: interesting rather than just you know

02:51:40.719 --> 02:51:44.239
Caption: five times what does that mean you know

02:51:42.478 --> 02:51:46.079
Caption: we don&#39;t really think about it right but

02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:48.399
Caption: i&#39;d like us to actually think what it

02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:50.160
Caption: was like for our compatriots software

02:51:48.399 --> 02:51:51.760
Caption: developers back in the day before

02:51:50.160 --> 02:51:53.919
Caption: high-level languages just to give you an

02:51:51.759 --> 02:51:56.160
Caption: idea of how important accidental

02:51:53.919 --> 02:51:58.559
Caption: complexity can actually be so what were

02:51:56.160 --> 02:52:00.160
Caption: they doing well first example this is

02:51:58.559 --> 02:52:01.839
Caption: something that i personally remember

02:52:00.160 --> 02:52:04.640
Caption: because i had a commodore 64 when i was

02:52:01.839 --> 02:52:06.000
Caption: a kid and no money so rather than being

02:52:04.639 --> 02:52:07.358
Caption: able to go and buy all the cool games

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:09.279
Caption: off the shelf sometimes we&#39;d come across

02:52:07.359 --> 02:52:11.359
Caption: a magazine and it would say type the

02:52:09.279 --> 02:52:12.720
Caption: game in yourself so

02:52:11.359 --> 02:52:14.319
Caption: it just sounds awesome when you&#39;re a kid

02:52:12.719 --> 02:52:16.160
Caption: when you read the description space

02:52:14.319 --> 02:52:17.600
Caption: blaster this is going to be so awesome

02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:18.959
Caption: like it&#39;s action packed and everything

02:52:17.599 --> 02:52:20.799
Caption: like that but then you&#39;ve got to write

02:52:18.959 --> 02:52:22.399
Caption: this out yourself and you can see

02:52:20.799 --> 02:52:24.240
Caption: there&#39;s a few lines of basic at the top

02:52:22.399 --> 02:52:26.240
Caption: that&#39;s bootstrapping but pretty much the

02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:28.879
Caption: whole game is actually in machine

02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:31.439
Caption: language for the 6502 cpu inside the

02:52:28.879 --> 02:52:34.799
Caption: commodore 64. and you have to specify it

02:52:31.439 --> 02:52:36.000
Caption: bite by byte as these like um

02:52:34.799 --> 02:52:37.438
Caption: hex codes

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:39.200
Caption: the other thing is if you get any of

02:52:37.439 --> 02:52:41.040
Caption: those wrong if you get one letter wrong

02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:42.319
Caption: one character wrong in any of that

02:52:41.040 --> 02:52:44.080
Caption: well if you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ve probably

02:52:42.319 --> 02:52:45.840
Caption: just screwed up a sprite and it&#39;s the

02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:47.599
Caption: you know the colors are mixed up in

02:52:45.839 --> 02:52:49.040
Caption: somewhere but more likely most of that

02:52:47.599 --> 02:52:50.559
Caption: will be control flow and logic for the

02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:51.679
Caption: game and if you just basically change a

02:52:50.559 --> 02:52:53.119
Caption: bite there

02:52:51.679 --> 02:52:55.599
Caption: all bets are off you probably crash your

02:52:53.120 --> 02:52:58.080
Caption: machine lock it up or who knows it

02:52:55.599 --> 02:53:01.040
Caption: probably won&#39;t be the fun uh space

02:52:58.080 --> 02:53:02.639
Caption: blaster experience you&#39;re hoping for

02:53:01.040 --> 02:53:04.000
Caption: going back even before that they had

02:53:02.639 --> 02:53:06.080
Caption: even extra steps you know they&#39;d fill

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:07.679
Caption: out these punched cards so i won&#39;t go

02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:09.520
Caption: too much into that that&#39;s really going

02:53:07.679 --> 02:53:11.438
Caption: back but i think you get the idea that

02:53:09.519 --> 02:53:13.119
Caption: there was a lot of accidental complexity

02:53:11.439 --> 02:53:14.319
Caption: involved in developing software back

02:53:13.120 --> 02:53:16.799
Caption: then you&#39;ve got to think at a really low

02:53:14.319 --> 02:53:18.640
Caption: level um the other thing is there&#39;s

02:53:16.799 --> 02:53:20.000
Caption: pretty much no protection from errors

02:53:18.639 --> 02:53:21.919
Caption: because the way there&#39;s no

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:23.679
Caption: interpretation step what you present to

02:53:21.919 --> 02:53:24.879
Caption: the computer it goes well this is what

02:53:23.679 --> 02:53:26.799
Caption: this must be what you meant i&#39;ll just

02:53:24.879 --> 02:53:29.519
Caption: try and execute it so basically i like

02:53:26.799 --> 02:53:31.438
Caption: to think of that as a cosmic ray on your

02:53:29.519 --> 02:53:32.959
Caption: on your um punch card give just gives

02:53:31.439 --> 02:53:34.880
Caption: you a new program as far as the computer

02:53:32.959 --> 02:53:36.719
Caption: is concerned oh okay every program that

02:53:34.879 --> 02:53:39.679
Caption: you give me is what i think you meant

02:53:36.719 --> 02:53:43.200
Caption: and it just executes differently

02:53:39.679 --> 02:53:45.679
Caption: so a little a little taste of that

02:53:43.200 --> 02:53:47.759
Caption: 6502 this was the cpu inside the

02:53:45.679 --> 02:53:49.120
Caption: commodore 64. and also the apple ii i&#39;ve

02:53:47.759 --> 02:53:51.120
Caption: got like six

02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:54.160
Caption: bytes of machine code at the top there

02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:55.600
Caption: and that decompiles into these assembly

02:53:54.160 --> 02:53:57.679
Caption: language instructions it&#39;s just a little

02:53:55.599 --> 02:53:58.879
Caption: loop it just starts at 255 and it counts

02:53:57.679 --> 02:54:00.719
Caption: down to zero and then and then it

02:53:58.879 --> 02:54:02.559
Caption: returns so that&#39;s all it does what i&#39;m

02:54:00.719 --> 02:54:04.160
Caption: going to do is on that last spot i&#39;m

02:54:02.559 --> 02:54:06.799
Caption: just going to change the 60 to a 61.

02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:09.439
Caption: it&#39;s one bit it&#39;s just changing one bit

02:54:06.799 --> 02:54:11.120
Caption: so watch watch down the bottom

02:54:09.439 --> 02:54:12.640
Caption: and now instead of returning from the

02:54:11.120 --> 02:54:14.319
Caption: instruction i&#39;m doing some further

02:54:12.639 --> 02:54:16.239
Caption: arithmetic and i&#39;m not returning and

02:54:14.319 --> 02:54:17.520
Caption: whatever comes after that is what is

02:54:16.240 --> 02:54:18.560
Caption: what the process is going to keep doing

02:54:17.519 --> 02:54:20.639
Caption: that&#39;s a good example that&#39;s probably

02:54:18.559 --> 02:54:21.679
Caption: just going to lock up your machine um

02:54:20.639 --> 02:54:23.278
Caption: yeah

02:54:21.679 --> 02:54:24.080
Caption: i had to restart my computer a lot of

02:54:23.279 --> 02:54:26.080
Caption: times

02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:28.399
Caption: um just another example so now i&#39;m just

02:54:26.080 --> 02:54:30.160
Caption: going to transpose the the two parts of

02:54:28.399 --> 02:54:31.680
Caption: the third byte so instead of ca it&#39;s

02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:33.520
Caption: going to be ac and we can watch down the

02:54:31.679 --> 02:54:34.799
Caption: bottom again and now i&#39;ve got pretty

02:54:33.519 --> 02:54:37.358
Caption: much a completely different program

02:54:34.799 --> 02:54:39.599
Caption: there&#39;s now no loop at all and it also

02:54:37.359 --> 02:54:40.640
Caption: still doesn&#39;t return so uh you&#39;re going

02:54:39.599 --> 02:54:42.239
Caption: to get a

02:54:40.639 --> 02:54:43.759
Caption: vastly different outcome and i just

02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:45.759
Caption: changed a couple of bits the program

02:54:43.759 --> 02:54:47.200
Caption: looks the same so that&#39;s all accidental

02:54:45.759 --> 02:54:48.879
Caption: complexity

02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:51.120
Caption: um just a bonus question to end this

02:54:48.879 --> 02:54:54.080
Caption: section can anyone think of any language

02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:55.600
Caption: that we still use very commonly probably

02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:57.599
Caption: most software developers in this room

02:54:55.599 --> 02:54:59.278
Caption: have have used at some point

02:54:57.599 --> 02:55:01.438
Caption: that has some of these characteristics

02:54:59.279 --> 02:55:03.359
Caption: that i&#39;ve just been describing

02:55:01.439 --> 02:55:04.319
Caption: yeah

02:55:03.359 --> 02:55:08.000
Caption: yes

02:55:04.319 --> 02:55:11.040
Caption: yes exactly regex i like to call it a

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:11.040
Caption: write-only language

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:16.559
Caption: see if you can think of what this regex

02:55:13.679 --> 02:55:18.398
Caption: does i i won&#39;t call for um volunteers

02:55:16.559 --> 02:55:20.799
Caption: but i&#39;ll just tell you it&#39;s it actually

02:55:18.399 --> 02:55:23.040
Caption: parses um or validates

02:55:20.799 --> 02:55:24.959
Caption: email addresses that&#39;s not obvious from

02:55:23.040 --> 02:55:26.319
Caption: looking at it so the way you would come

02:55:24.959 --> 02:55:27.679
Caption: up with that is you&#39;d think at a high

02:55:26.319 --> 02:55:29.279
Caption: level okay what are the parts of an

02:55:27.679 --> 02:55:30.879
Caption: email address and you translate it down

02:55:29.279 --> 02:55:33.680
Caption: into this kind of almost like machine

02:55:30.879 --> 02:55:35.040
Caption: language um and then if you ever try and

02:55:33.679 --> 02:55:36.559
Caption: want to know what that does again i

02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:38.080
Caption: would probably just copy it and paste it

02:55:36.559 --> 02:55:39.519
Caption: into one of those websites that sort of

02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:41.200
Caption: decompiles and regex for you and gives

02:55:39.519 --> 02:55:42.799
Caption: you a visualization it&#39;s not that

02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:45.359
Caption: different from what they were doing back

02:55:42.799 --> 02:55:47.919
Caption: in the day so yeah we still have this

02:55:45.359 --> 02:55:49.439
Caption: okay moving on again

02:55:47.919 --> 02:55:51.679
Caption: now we&#39;re moving to this section where

02:55:49.439 --> 02:55:53.760
Caption: i&#39;m really focusing on the human aspect

02:55:51.679 --> 02:55:55.519
Caption: of programming language design

02:55:53.759 --> 02:55:57.919
Caption: um

02:55:55.519 --> 02:56:00.159
Caption: we don&#39;t want to overburden the human

02:55:57.919 --> 02:56:01.359
Caption: why is that well

02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:03.279
Caption: i&#39;m just going to start with this quote

02:56:01.359 --> 02:56:04.560
Caption: from donald knuth he&#39;s pointing out that

02:56:03.279 --> 02:56:06.560
Caption: programming is the art of telling

02:56:04.559 --> 02:56:08.318
Caption: another human being

02:56:06.559 --> 02:56:10.318
Caption: what one wants the computer to do

02:56:08.319 --> 02:56:12.399
Caption: programming languages aren&#39;t for the

02:56:10.319 --> 02:56:13.680
Caption: machine they&#39;re therefore people if if

02:56:12.399 --> 02:56:15.760
Caption: programming languages were for the

02:56:13.679 --> 02:56:17.438
Caption: machine we&#39;d still be programming in

02:56:15.759 --> 02:56:18.719
Caption: assembly language or machine language

02:56:17.439 --> 02:56:20.880
Caption: because that&#39;s the easiest thing for the

02:56:18.719 --> 02:56:22.318
Caption: machine to process the reason why we use

02:56:20.879 --> 02:56:24.559
Caption: these high-level languages and then all

02:56:22.319 --> 02:56:26.399
Caption: these very sophisticated tools to

02:56:24.559 --> 02:56:28.719
Caption: translate that down to the machine is

02:56:26.399 --> 02:56:31.680
Caption: that the source code of programs is for

02:56:28.719 --> 02:56:31.679
Caption: us it&#39;s for humans

02:56:32.319 --> 02:56:36.479
Caption: so um if you think about what&#39;s scarce

02:56:34.959 --> 02:56:38.240
Caption: in the production of software it&#39;s

02:56:36.478 --> 02:56:39.438
Caption: definitely not making more copies of it

02:56:38.240 --> 02:56:41.279
Caption: it&#39;s free to make more copies of

02:56:39.439 --> 02:56:43.680
Caption: software like all the the the raw

02:56:41.279 --> 02:56:46.240
Caption: materials of what we use uh

02:56:43.679 --> 02:56:48.318
Caption: ram in memory cpu cycles like they&#39;re

02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:51.520
Caption: really cheap the marginal cost of that

02:56:48.319 --> 02:56:53.040
Caption: is almost zero um so why is software

02:56:51.519 --> 02:56:54.879
Caption: expensive and why you know we talked

02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:56.399
Caption: before about the trillions of dollars

02:56:54.879 --> 02:56:58.080
Caption: worth of you know the cost of software

02:56:56.399 --> 02:57:00.800
Caption: bugs what what makes up the expense well

02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:02.719
Caption: i i&#39;d say it&#39;s actually human ability so

02:57:00.799 --> 02:57:04.398
Caption: humans we&#39;ve got limited working memory

02:57:02.719 --> 02:57:06.080
Caption: limited cognitive powers and limited

02:57:04.399 --> 02:57:07.359
Caption: reliability this kind of links back to

02:57:06.080 --> 02:57:09.679
Caption: the keynote this morning when we&#39;re

02:57:07.359 --> 02:57:11.600
Caption: talking about talking about

02:57:09.679 --> 02:57:13.040
Caption: fallibility of human memory in

02:57:11.599 --> 02:57:14.318
Caption: particular so that&#39;s just one of these

02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:17.759
Caption: things

02:57:14.319 --> 02:57:20.720
Caption: and programming languages that um adapt

02:57:17.759 --> 02:57:23.438
Caption: for that can actually really empower us

02:57:20.719 --> 02:57:24.239
Caption: ones that ignore the humanness uh and

02:57:23.439 --> 02:57:26.240
Caption: and

02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:27.359
Caption: we&#39;ll see some examples anyway

02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:28.879
Caption: they&#39;re probably the ones where it&#39;s

02:57:27.359 --> 02:57:30.720
Caption: going to be harder to express a correct

02:57:28.879 --> 02:57:32.398
Caption: program and and increase your rate of

02:57:30.719 --> 02:57:34.559
Caption: bugs

02:57:32.399 --> 02:57:36.160
Caption: so how could the programming language

02:57:34.559 --> 02:57:38.559
Caption: itself how could the design of it

02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:40.000
Caption: actually help with this sort of human

02:57:38.559 --> 02:57:42.799
Caption: focus on the programming language

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:44.160
Caption: particularly humans being limited so

02:57:42.799 --> 02:57:45.679
Caption: i&#39;ve just got a whole bunch of examples

02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:48.000
Caption: there i just bolded a couple that i

02:57:45.679 --> 02:57:50.639
Caption: could just briefly speak to like raising

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:52.160
Caption: the level of abstraction to reduce the

02:57:50.639 --> 02:57:53.199
Caption: semantic gap so

02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:55.439
Caption: um

02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:58.000
Caption: we saw before you know literally putting

02:57:55.439 --> 02:57:59.359
Caption: in the hex codes you can&#39;t really look

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.639
Caption: at that and see what the program does

02:57:59.359 --> 02:58:02.240
Caption: although i did do an early version of

02:58:00.639 --> 02:58:04.239
Caption: this and someone who saw the commodore

02:58:02.240 --> 02:58:05.919
Caption: 64 stuff says i know what that does

02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:07.439
Caption: because he had one when he and he still

02:58:05.919 --> 02:58:08.719
Caption: remembers all the op codes but for most

02:58:07.439 --> 02:58:10.319
Caption: of us

02:58:08.719 --> 02:58:12.318
Caption: if you see source code you want to see

02:58:10.319 --> 02:58:14.080
Caption: something that is kind of human readable

02:58:12.319 --> 02:58:16.319
Caption: for most of us in here that&#39;s things

02:58:14.080 --> 02:58:17.439
Caption: like you know the english keywords and

02:58:16.319 --> 02:58:20.080
Caption: visual

02:58:17.439 --> 02:58:22.560
Caption: breakdown of of blocks in the code and i

02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:24.959
Caption: put that one there visuality use layout

02:58:22.559 --> 02:58:26.959
Caption: and um keywords and punctuation to

02:58:24.959 --> 02:58:29.040
Caption: actually make you know we can recognize

02:58:26.959 --> 02:58:30.959
Caption: patterns visually very very quickly so

02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:32.399
Caption: if your source code actually allows for

02:58:30.959 --> 02:58:36.959
Caption: that pattern recognition of humans by

02:58:32.399 --> 02:58:36.959
Caption: having visually indented and

02:58:37.120 --> 02:58:40.879
Caption: delimited blocks we can see that very

02:58:39.359 --> 02:58:42.720
Caption: very quickly that works with us it helps

02:58:40.879 --> 02:58:44.639
Caption: us to produce software faster and with

02:58:42.719 --> 02:58:47.120
Caption: less mistakes

02:58:44.639 --> 02:58:48.318
Caption: and also we what we really want to

02:58:47.120 --> 02:58:50.959
Caption: optimize in our code is

02:58:48.319 --> 02:58:52.879
Caption: understandability not necessarily making

02:58:50.959 --> 02:58:54.799
Caption: source code as short as possible having

02:58:52.879 --> 02:58:57.279
Caption: a language that is the the shortest to

02:58:54.799 --> 02:58:59.120
Caption: express or the most minimal language

02:58:57.279 --> 02:59:01.279
Caption: like the one with the fewest constructs

02:58:59.120 --> 02:59:02.319
Caption: that doesn&#39;t necessarily win if it comes

02:59:01.279 --> 02:59:04.240
Caption: at the expense of human

02:59:02.319 --> 02:59:04.959
Caption: understandability

02:59:04.240 --> 02:59:07.839
Caption: so

02:59:04.959 --> 02:59:09.839
Caption: just one quick example for this section

02:59:07.839 --> 02:59:12.080
Caption: i&#39;d say most of us are pretty familiar

02:59:09.839 --> 02:59:14.559
Caption: with basic control flow constructs like

02:59:12.080 --> 02:59:16.639
Caption: this so control flow is basically just

02:59:14.559 --> 02:59:18.159
Caption: um it&#39;s an imperative concept for

02:59:16.639 --> 02:59:20.159
Caption: imperative languages which are the ones

02:59:18.160 --> 02:59:22.799
Caption: i&#39;d say most of us use like java c-sharp

02:59:20.160 --> 02:59:24.640
Caption: things like that you do things in order

02:59:22.799 --> 02:59:26.879
Caption: there&#39;s a time-based component i do step

02:59:24.639 --> 02:59:28.318
Caption: one then i do step two and if that&#39;s all

02:59:26.879 --> 02:59:30.000
Caption: you could do step one two three you

02:59:28.319 --> 02:59:31.200
Caption: could only write a linear a logic

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.478
Caption: program and it would always terminate

02:59:31.200 --> 02:59:34.080
Caption: depending on how long you know just

02:59:32.478 --> 02:59:36.478
Caption: basically how many lines you&#39;ve got if

02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:37.839
Caption: you want things that run forever um or

02:59:36.478 --> 02:59:39.358
Caption: you know run indefinitely let&#39;s say

02:59:37.839 --> 02:59:41.200
Caption: probably you don&#39;t want an infinite loop

02:59:39.359 --> 02:59:42.959
Caption: uh you need control flow constructs that

02:59:41.200 --> 02:59:44.479
Caption: can alter the order in which statements

02:59:42.959 --> 02:59:47.120
Caption: are executed and these really common

02:59:44.478 --> 02:59:48.559
Caption: ones the top two are loops so you can

02:59:47.120 --> 02:59:50.080
Caption: keep repeating the same series of

02:59:48.559 --> 02:59:51.119
Caption: instructions while some condition is

02:59:50.080 --> 02:59:53.919
Caption: true

02:59:51.120 --> 02:59:55.759
Caption: or you could loop over every item in a

02:59:53.919 --> 02:59:57.919
Caption: collection so they&#39;re really common and

02:59:55.759 --> 02:59:59.839
Caption: then the bottom two are conditionals so

02:59:57.919 --> 03:00:01.200
Caption: it&#39;s like just conditionally execute

02:59:59.839 --> 03:00:02.959
Caption: these things if a certain condition is

03:00:01.200 --> 03:00:03.919
Caption: true otherwise skip them

03:00:02.959 --> 03:00:06.160
Caption: or

03:00:03.919 --> 03:00:08.080
Caption: look at this value and then depending on

03:00:06.160 --> 03:00:09.279
Caption: what it is either do this or do this or

03:00:08.080 --> 03:00:11.520
Caption: do this so that&#39;s like a switch

03:00:09.279 --> 03:00:14.000
Caption: statement um pretty basic like you know

03:00:11.519 --> 03:00:16.239
Caption: i think we&#39;re all familiar with that

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:19.599
Caption: but what if i told you we could go even

03:00:16.240 --> 03:00:21.839
Caption: simpler what if i told you that a single

03:00:19.599 --> 03:00:23.278
Caption: control flow construct could do

03:00:21.839 --> 03:00:25.279
Caption: everything all those others do and we

03:00:23.279 --> 03:00:27.040
Caption: can just sweep them away and make our

03:00:25.279 --> 03:00:29.839
Caption: language even simpler with just one kind

03:00:27.040 --> 03:00:32.160
Caption: of control flow well it exists

03:00:29.839 --> 03:00:33.679
Caption: if condition go to label

03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:35.120
Caption: so

03:00:33.679 --> 03:00:37.599
Caption: it just means that you should be able to

03:00:35.120 --> 03:00:39.279
Caption: label any line in your code and then you

03:00:37.599 --> 03:00:41.919
Caption: can say well if this condition is true

03:00:39.279 --> 03:00:43.680
Caption: when you execute this line just jump to

03:00:41.919 --> 03:00:45.759
Caption: that other label

03:00:43.679 --> 03:00:47.519
Caption: so um i thought i&#39;d give a demonstration

03:00:45.759 --> 03:00:49.120
Caption: to show how great this would be i picked

03:00:47.519 --> 03:00:51.039
Caption: a modern language that actually still

03:00:49.120 --> 03:00:53.120
Caption: allows go to so i was actually able to

03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:56.240
Caption: test it and this is working code so i&#39;ve

03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:58.080
Caption: started with a a prime generator that&#39;s

03:00:56.240 --> 03:00:59.839
Caption: pretty straightforward it basically just

03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:01.200
Caption: goes through all the numbers from 100

03:00:59.839 --> 03:01:02.799
Caption: and then for that number it does an

03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:04.319
Caption: inner loop to try and find something

03:01:02.799 --> 03:01:06.559
Caption: that divides into it that excludes it

03:01:04.319 --> 03:01:08.319
Caption: from being a prime so

03:01:06.559 --> 03:01:10.318
Caption: if it if it gets through that inner loop

03:01:08.319 --> 03:01:11.919
Caption: and it hasn&#39;t fine found any divisors

03:01:10.319 --> 03:01:13.200
Caption: then it&#39;s still a prime and then we just

03:01:11.919 --> 03:01:14.799
Caption: print it to the console and that&#39;s what

03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:15.839
Caption: it prints out one two three five seven

03:01:14.799 --> 03:01:18.639
Caption: and so on

03:01:15.839 --> 03:01:20.398
Caption: up to 97. so i just chose that example

03:01:18.639 --> 03:01:21.919
Caption: because it&#39;s relatively simple but it&#39;s

03:01:20.399 --> 03:01:23.439
Caption: got it&#39;s got loops and it&#39;s got

03:01:21.919 --> 03:01:26.719
Caption: conditionals in it now i&#39;m going to

03:01:23.439 --> 03:01:29.520
Caption: transform it using my awesome one one

03:01:26.719 --> 03:01:31.839
Caption: only control flow construct if

03:01:29.519 --> 03:01:33.278
Caption: condition go to label so first of all i

03:01:31.839 --> 03:01:34.559
Caption: get rid of the outer for loop and i&#39;ve

03:01:33.279 --> 03:01:35.919
Caption: replaced that i needed a couple of

03:01:34.559 --> 03:01:37.519
Caption: labels and a couple of new go to

03:01:35.919 --> 03:01:39.438
Caption: statements but it&#39;s the same program

03:01:37.519 --> 03:01:41.839
Caption: still works the same this is this is all

03:01:39.439 --> 03:01:43.680
Caption: valid c sharp um then i get rid of the

03:01:41.839 --> 03:01:45.839
Caption: inner for loop then i get rid of the

03:01:43.679 --> 03:01:47.278
Caption: first if and then i get rid of the

03:01:45.839 --> 03:01:49.279
Caption: second if and now i&#39;ve got a final

03:01:47.279 --> 03:01:50.800
Caption: program that does exactly the same thing

03:01:49.279 --> 03:01:52.399
Caption: as the first one but it&#39;s way simpler

03:01:50.799 --> 03:01:54.240
Caption: because it&#39;s only got one control flow

03:01:52.399 --> 03:01:55.520
Caption: construct and also we got rid of all

03:01:54.240 --> 03:01:58.160
Caption: that weird indenting and now it&#39;s all

03:01:55.519 --> 03:01:58.159
Caption: nice and straight

03:01:59.439 --> 03:02:03.200
Caption: so there&#39;s my before and there&#39;s my

03:02:00.959 --> 03:02:05.679
Caption: after okay it&#39;s slightly longer

03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:07.439
Caption: what would you choose in terms of i mean

03:02:05.679 --> 03:02:10.318
Caption: we&#39;re talking here about human limited

03:02:07.439 --> 03:02:11.760
Caption: human cognitive ability right um maybe

03:02:10.319 --> 03:02:13.439
Caption: it&#39;s just my training but i would take

03:02:11.759 --> 03:02:14.959
Caption: the one on the left still

03:02:13.439 --> 03:02:16.399
Caption: even though you could say it&#39;s more

03:02:14.959 --> 03:02:18.080
Caption: complex because it&#39;s got more different

03:02:16.399 --> 03:02:20.000
Caption: constructs so it&#39;s not about minimality

03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:22.000
Caption: sometimes it&#39;s about working with the

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.799
Caption: human the way we think i can visually

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.719
Caption: see

03:02:22.799 --> 03:02:26.080
Caption: the loops in this one on that one i

03:02:24.719 --> 03:02:28.318
Caption: would basically have to run it in my

03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:28.319
Caption: head

03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:33.839
Caption: so um if you look for pictures of go to

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:35.759
Caption: people doing go-to programming you often

03:02:33.839 --> 03:02:37.679
Caption: find these print um these screenshots

03:02:35.759 --> 03:02:39.839
Caption: that they&#39;ve done of some old bit of

03:02:37.679 --> 03:02:41.679
Caption: working out where they&#39;d obviously drawn

03:02:39.839 --> 03:02:43.759
Caption: all over the program source code to try

03:02:41.679 --> 03:02:45.919
Caption: and um get it into their head what&#39;s

03:02:43.759 --> 03:02:47.759
Caption: actually going on so on the left we&#39;ve

03:02:45.919 --> 03:02:49.599
Caption: just got these you can express any

03:02:47.759 --> 03:02:52.398
Caption: control flow with these three constructs

03:02:49.599 --> 03:02:54.159
Caption: sequence selection repetition um on the

03:02:52.399 --> 03:02:55.439
Caption: right you can just use one control flow

03:02:54.160 --> 03:02:57.600
Caption: construct but it&#39;s actually a lot harder

03:02:55.439 --> 03:02:59.200
Caption: to understand

03:02:57.599 --> 03:03:00.239
Caption: okay

03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:01.839
Caption: so

03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:03.759
Caption: um that&#39;s probably a good segue into

03:03:01.839 --> 03:03:06.000
Caption: this one which is also about uh the

03:03:03.759 --> 03:03:07.679
Caption: humanity the human side of programming

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:09.519
Caption: languages and how to take it into

03:03:07.679 --> 03:03:11.358
Caption: account so before we were saying don&#39;t

03:03:09.519 --> 03:03:13.358
Caption: over burden the human now we&#39;re saying

03:03:11.359 --> 03:03:14.959
Caption: don&#39;t rely on the human because even if

03:03:13.359 --> 03:03:17.680
Caption: you make it easy for them humans are

03:03:14.959 --> 03:03:20.319
Caption: fallible we make mistakes

03:03:17.679 --> 03:03:21.599
Caption: so um

03:03:20.319 --> 03:03:23.279
Caption: the the main point i want to make in

03:03:21.599 --> 03:03:24.959
Caption: this section briefly is that if a

03:03:23.279 --> 03:03:26.959
Caption: programming task could be described as a

03:03:24.959 --> 03:03:28.799
Caption: set of mechanical transforms

03:03:26.959 --> 03:03:30.799
Caption: then design the programming language

03:03:28.799 --> 03:03:32.478
Caption: itself to just fully automate that just

03:03:30.799 --> 03:03:34.318
Caption: take it out of the hands of the human

03:03:32.478 --> 03:03:36.559
Caption: because we&#39;re not that good at

03:03:34.319 --> 03:03:38.399
Caption: perfectly reproducing the same

03:03:36.559 --> 03:03:39.679
Caption: transformation again and again in a

03:03:38.399 --> 03:03:43.120
Caption: manual way

03:03:39.679 --> 03:03:46.000
Caption: i ca i call this um the human compiler

03:03:43.120 --> 03:03:47.600
Caption: anti-pattern so uh i don&#39;t think you&#39;ll

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.399
Caption: find that on google because i just made

03:03:47.599 --> 03:03:49.358
Caption: it up

03:03:48.399 --> 03:03:50.880
Caption: um

03:03:49.359 --> 03:03:52.080
Caption: but the reason i call it the human

03:03:50.879 --> 03:03:53.358
Caption: compiler anti-patent because i&#39;m

03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:54.879
Caption: thinking that you know people even get

03:03:53.359 --> 03:03:56.959
Caption: proud of doing this stuff you know it&#39;s

03:03:54.879 --> 03:03:59.679
Caption: like wow you know i can really reliably

03:03:56.959 --> 03:04:01.519
Caption: create this really complicated code um

03:03:59.679 --> 03:04:03.679
Caption: but actually what they are doing could

03:04:01.519 --> 03:04:05.839
Caption: be automated by the the programming

03:04:03.679 --> 03:04:07.679
Caption: language tools themselves

03:04:05.839 --> 03:04:09.279
Caption: that&#39;s great for this hotshot whoever

03:04:07.679 --> 03:04:11.839
Caption: they are you know that&#39;s really awesome

03:04:09.279 --> 03:04:13.760
Caption: for their self-esteem and so on but

03:04:11.839 --> 03:04:15.200
Caption: statistically speaking as an industry

03:04:13.759 --> 03:04:17.040
Caption: it&#39;s going to increase our error rates

03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:17.919
Caption: if we require humans to do that sort of

03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:18.959
Caption: stuff

03:04:17.919 --> 03:04:20.879
Caption: so

03:04:18.959 --> 03:04:22.799
Caption: um

03:04:20.879 --> 03:04:24.080
Caption: let&#39;s have a quick look at an example

03:04:22.799 --> 03:04:26.240
Caption: that i set up

03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:28.560
Caption: this is javascript

03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:29.680
Caption: and i&#39;ve just got a function here

03:04:28.559 --> 03:04:31.519
Caption: that

03:04:29.679 --> 03:04:32.959
Caption: uh as it says at the top it returns a

03:04:31.519 --> 03:04:34.799
Caption: number of files in a given directory so

03:04:32.959 --> 03:04:36.799
Caption: it&#39;s a function i pass it in a directory

03:04:34.799 --> 03:04:38.799
Caption: path and at the end it&#39;s going to return

03:04:36.799 --> 03:04:40.799
Caption: me a number which is how many files not

03:04:38.799 --> 03:04:42.879
Caption: directories but files in there and the

03:04:40.799 --> 03:04:44.959
Caption: way it works is by making a couple of

03:04:42.879 --> 03:04:46.319
Caption: system calls one is to

03:04:44.959 --> 03:04:47.759
Caption: get a list of all the files in the

03:04:46.319 --> 03:04:49.279
Caption: directory and it just gives the short

03:04:47.759 --> 03:04:51.120
Caption: names of the files not the full path so

03:04:49.279 --> 03:04:52.560
Caption: then we have to map them to full paths

03:04:51.120 --> 03:04:55.279
Caption: and then we can go and make another

03:04:52.559 --> 03:04:56.959
Caption: series of system calls one per file and

03:04:55.279 --> 03:04:58.479
Caption: get the stats and the stats will tell us

03:04:56.959 --> 03:04:59.839
Caption: if it&#39;s a file or a directory and then

03:04:58.478 --> 03:05:02.318
Caption: we&#39;ve got all the information we need to

03:04:59.839 --> 03:05:04.318
Caption: count up the files in the directory so i

03:05:02.319 --> 03:05:05.520
Caption: think that&#39;s pretty um pretty

03:05:04.319 --> 03:05:07.600
Caption: straightforward and i just wanted to

03:05:05.519 --> 03:05:08.559
Caption: highlight that this is in a sync

03:05:07.599 --> 03:05:10.398
Caption: function

03:05:08.559 --> 03:05:11.519
Caption: and we use a weight i don&#39;t want to go

03:05:10.399 --> 03:05:12.800
Caption: into all the

03:05:11.519 --> 03:05:14.719
Caption: ins and outs in that i&#39;m hoping that

03:05:12.799 --> 03:05:17.599
Caption: enough of you understand a bit about

03:05:14.719 --> 03:05:18.879
Caption: asynchronous programming um to just

03:05:17.599 --> 03:05:20.559
Caption: you know if you if you came into

03:05:18.879 --> 03:05:22.799
Caption: javascript or another language with a

03:05:20.559 --> 03:05:25.119
Caption: sink away in the last say five years i

03:05:22.799 --> 03:05:27.519
Caption: think that&#39;s hopefully fairly easy to

03:05:25.120 --> 03:05:28.639
Caption: understand um but a sink away is another

03:05:27.519 --> 03:05:30.879
Caption: one of these things that is an

03:05:28.639 --> 03:05:32.799
Caption: innovation that wasn&#39;t always around

03:05:30.879 --> 03:05:35.358
Caption: what came before a sync away what was

03:05:32.799 --> 03:05:37.278
Caption: being required of the programmer before

03:05:35.359 --> 03:05:39.439
Caption: it sort of took care of these

03:05:37.279 --> 03:05:40.479
Caption: concurrency patterns for us

03:05:39.439 --> 03:05:42.560
Caption: well

03:05:40.478 --> 03:05:46.159
Caption: when i first started using node it was

03:05:42.559 --> 03:05:47.278
Caption: on the zero point x version number

03:05:46.160 --> 03:05:48.640
Caption: javascript

03:05:47.279 --> 03:05:50.800
Caption: it was always running on javascript on

03:05:48.639 --> 03:05:52.239
Caption: v8 but javascript at the time didn&#39;t

03:05:50.799 --> 03:05:53.278
Caption: have a sync away it didn&#39;t even have

03:05:52.240 --> 03:05:55.200
Caption: promises

03:05:53.279 --> 03:05:56.479
Caption: so if you wanted to do asynchronous

03:05:55.200 --> 03:05:58.319
Caption: operations and node has always been

03:05:56.478 --> 03:06:00.799
Caption: fully asynchronous from day one you

03:05:58.319 --> 03:06:03.520
Caption: basically say go and start this job like

03:06:00.799 --> 03:06:05.438
Caption: go and get the the file stats for me and

03:06:03.519 --> 03:06:06.719
Caption: when you&#39;re done call this callback that

03:06:05.439 --> 03:06:07.920
Caption: i&#39;m going to give you now so it&#39;s all

03:06:06.719 --> 03:06:10.239
Caption: callback based it&#39;s basically

03:06:07.919 --> 03:06:12.559
Caption: continuation passing so

03:06:10.240 --> 03:06:14.000
Caption: i&#39;ve got the next slide is this exact

03:06:12.559 --> 03:06:15.358
Caption: same program that you would have to

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:17.040
Caption: write manually

03:06:15.359 --> 03:06:18.080
Caption: it&#39;s the same program

03:06:17.040 --> 03:06:20.719
Caption: you would have to write this out

03:06:18.080 --> 03:06:22.719
Caption: manually and manage all the uh the

03:06:20.719 --> 03:06:23.519
Caption: callbacks yourself there&#39;s a bunch of

03:06:22.719 --> 03:06:24.719
Caption: them

03:06:23.519 --> 03:06:26.799
Caption: up there so

03:06:24.719 --> 03:06:28.879
Caption: you pass you ask for a call back and

03:06:26.799 --> 03:06:30.799
Caption: then you call that call back when you&#39;ve

03:06:28.879 --> 03:06:32.398
Caption: either got an error

03:06:30.799 --> 03:06:35.278
Caption: well actually there&#39;s all the error

03:06:32.399 --> 03:06:37.120
Caption: pathways so there&#39;s several ways that

03:06:35.279 --> 03:06:38.959
Caption: you could get errors at different points

03:06:37.120 --> 03:06:40.799
Caption: you&#39;ve now got to manually do all that

03:06:38.959 --> 03:06:43.120
Caption: bookkeeping and if you get that wrong

03:06:40.799 --> 03:06:45.679
Caption: you might just swallow the error

03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:47.439
Caption: or you might just actually return

03:06:45.679 --> 03:06:49.759
Caption: several errors like a basic thing about

03:06:47.439 --> 03:06:51.680
Caption: functions is that if you call it once

03:06:49.759 --> 03:06:54.000
Caption: it&#39;s either going to return or it&#39;s

03:06:51.679 --> 03:06:55.199
Caption: going to throw an exception right the

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:57.519
Caption: only exception to that is like an

03:06:55.200 --> 03:06:59.520
Caption: infinite loop but we won&#39;t go into that

03:06:57.519 --> 03:07:01.599
Caption: here you&#39;ve actually got the the

03:06:59.519 --> 03:07:02.799
Caption: erroneous possibilities of calling the

03:07:01.599 --> 03:07:04.559
Caption: callback which is the equivalent of

03:07:02.799 --> 03:07:07.040
Caption: returning from the function

03:07:04.559 --> 03:07:08.719
Caption: and sending back multiple errors or

03:07:07.040 --> 03:07:10.799
Caption: multiple returns

03:07:08.719 --> 03:07:12.398
Caption: or even sending back errors and return

03:07:10.799 --> 03:07:14.478
Caption: values at the same time there&#39;s so many

03:07:12.399 --> 03:07:15.760
Caption: ways that this could go wrong but people

03:07:14.478 --> 03:07:17.358
Caption: and and i remember you know coming

03:07:15.759 --> 03:07:18.799
Caption: across reddit threads like it&#39;s not that

03:07:17.359 --> 03:07:20.800
Caption: hard like i&#39;m really good at i&#39;ve never

03:07:18.799 --> 03:07:24.559
Caption: made any mistakes um

03:07:20.799 --> 03:07:26.478
Caption: yeah sure however

03:07:24.559 --> 03:07:27.839
Caption: this is really just gonna on

03:07:26.478 --> 03:07:29.039
Caption: statistically speaking on average that&#39;s

03:07:27.839 --> 03:07:30.719
Caption: really going to reduce error rates

03:07:29.040 --> 03:07:32.959
Caption: across the board right so if the

03:07:30.719 --> 03:07:35.120
Caption: compiler can do it it should do it for

03:07:32.959 --> 03:07:35.120
Caption: you

03:07:35.519 --> 03:07:38.478
Caption: that does sort of raise the question of

03:07:37.120 --> 03:07:40.080
Caption: design patterns because they sort of

03:07:38.478 --> 03:07:43.119
Caption: make that thing of

03:07:40.080 --> 03:07:44.719
Caption: really mechanical transforms on code to

03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:47.279
Caption: to handle certain situations that you

03:07:44.719 --> 03:07:48.318
Caption: can always apply reliably right

03:07:47.279 --> 03:07:50.000
Caption: so i&#39;m not saying that they&#39;re all bad

03:07:48.319 --> 03:07:52.399
Caption: but i think it&#39;s interesting to look at

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:53.919
Caption: some of the design patterns and they&#39;re

03:07:52.399 --> 03:07:55.359
Caption: written for specific languages some

03:07:53.919 --> 03:07:57.120
Caption: design patterns you really don&#39;t need to

03:07:55.359 --> 03:07:58.800
Caption: code in a special way depending on which

03:07:57.120 --> 03:08:00.240
Caption: language it&#39;s in and it&#39;s an interesting

03:07:58.799 --> 03:08:02.080
Caption: framework to look at design patterns

03:08:00.240 --> 03:08:03.520
Caption: that they&#39;re not always a great idea

03:08:02.080 --> 03:08:05.200
Caption: they might actually be telling you that

03:08:03.519 --> 03:08:07.278
Caption: your programming language itself is not

03:08:05.200 --> 03:08:09.120
Caption: expressive enough because you&#39;ve got to

03:08:07.279 --> 03:08:11.520
Caption: do this sort of manual transformation to

03:08:09.120 --> 03:08:13.759
Caption: get the that kind of code to work that&#39;s

03:08:11.519 --> 03:08:16.318
Caption: for that&#39;s a talk for another time so

03:08:13.759 --> 03:08:18.398
Caption: moving on um making invalid states

03:08:16.319 --> 03:08:20.160
Caption: unrepresentable now this is the section

03:08:18.399 --> 03:08:21.920
Caption: that i would want to do the full talk on

03:08:20.160 --> 03:08:24.000
Caption: because this is my jam

03:08:21.919 --> 03:08:26.799
Caption: what i really want to talk about here is

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:28.719
Caption: type systems uh unfortunately i&#39;ve

03:08:26.799 --> 03:08:29.919
Caption: probably got about five minutes to cover

03:08:28.719 --> 03:08:30.799
Caption: this section

03:08:29.919 --> 03:08:32.398
Caption: um

03:08:30.799 --> 03:08:34.398
Caption: and

03:08:32.399 --> 03:08:35.680
Caption: to motivate this like why would we care

03:08:34.399 --> 03:08:37.040
Caption: about type systems how does that fit

03:08:35.679 --> 03:08:39.679
Caption: into this whole thing of programming

03:08:37.040 --> 03:08:41.679
Caption: language limitations and so on well this

03:08:39.679 --> 03:08:43.040
Caption: chart kind of says it all so on this

03:08:41.679 --> 03:08:45.199
Caption: chart we&#39;ve got these bars that get

03:08:43.040 --> 03:08:47.679
Caption: bigger to the right um the the bigger

03:08:45.200 --> 03:08:50.160
Caption: the bar the higher the cost to repair a

03:08:47.679 --> 03:08:52.398
Caption: defect in software and the further to

03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:53.759
Caption: the right you go it may seem it means

03:08:52.399 --> 03:08:55.439
Caption: the later

03:08:53.759 --> 03:08:57.919
Caption: the bug was discovered

03:08:55.439 --> 03:08:59.359
Caption: so that really tall bar on the right

03:08:57.919 --> 03:09:01.359
Caption: is bugs that were discovered in

03:08:59.359 --> 03:09:02.880
Caption: production so you&#39;ve you&#39;ve crafted your

03:09:01.359 --> 03:09:05.600
Caption: piece of software it&#39;s gone through all

03:09:02.879 --> 03:09:07.919
Caption: your qa it&#39;s gone out to customers and

03:09:05.599 --> 03:09:09.040
Caption: at that point the bug is discovered if

03:09:07.919 --> 03:09:10.719
Caption: you&#39;re lucky

03:09:09.040 --> 03:09:12.479
Caption: the bug was discovered by your customers

03:09:10.719 --> 03:09:13.599
Caption: and only hopefully a few of them and you

03:09:12.478 --> 03:09:14.959
Caption: might have to make them whole and that

03:09:13.599 --> 03:09:17.119
Caption: might cost some money

03:09:14.959 --> 03:09:19.438
Caption: if you&#39;re unlucky it might affect all

03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:21.279
Caption: your customers catastrophically with

03:09:19.439 --> 03:09:23.200
Caption: whatever financial losses if you&#39;re even

03:09:21.279 --> 03:09:25.200
Caption: more unlucky it&#39;s not the customers that

03:09:23.200 --> 03:09:26.799
Caption: are affected it&#39;s it&#39;s you that&#39;s

03:09:25.200 --> 03:09:29.200
Caption: affected because someone has found a

03:09:26.799 --> 03:09:31.438
Caption: vulnerability in your code and they&#39;ve

03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:33.520
Caption: found a way to hack the system and cause

03:09:31.439 --> 03:09:35.120
Caption: all kinds of other damage like stealing

03:09:33.519 --> 03:09:37.759
Caption: information about your customers that

03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:40.000
Caption: can be extremely costly so that&#39;s i

03:09:37.759 --> 03:09:41.519
Caption: think the sort of rationale for why

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.879
Caption: there&#39;s this pattern of raising costs

03:09:41.519 --> 03:09:44.959
Caption: the further out you go

03:09:42.879 --> 03:09:47.200
Caption: catching it earlier means catching it in

03:09:44.959 --> 03:09:49.679
Caption: say qc but if you&#39;ve got say a big team

03:09:47.200 --> 03:09:51.439
Caption: of human qc testers there&#39;s a cost

03:09:49.679 --> 03:09:53.278
Caption: involved in having that team right so

03:09:51.439 --> 03:09:54.080
Caption: it&#39;s quite costly to to be using that

03:09:53.279 --> 03:09:56.240
Caption: team

03:09:54.080 --> 03:09:58.080
Caption: if there&#39;s whole classes of bugs that

03:09:56.240 --> 03:09:59.520
Caption: you could find before it even leaves

03:09:58.080 --> 03:10:01.679
Caption: your laptop where you&#39;re where you&#39;re

03:09:59.519 --> 03:10:03.199
Caption: making the software it&#39;s even cheaper

03:10:01.679 --> 03:10:04.879
Caption: because you never it never goes through

03:10:03.200 --> 03:10:06.000
Caption: those later steps right so this is a

03:10:04.879 --> 03:10:07.759
Caption: time when it&#39;s really cheap to catch

03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:09.679
Caption: bugs the cheapest time is when you just

03:10:07.759 --> 03:10:11.438
Caption: catch things that are wrong in the spec

03:10:09.679 --> 03:10:12.799
Caption: before you even write code but we&#39;re

03:10:11.439 --> 03:10:14.800
Caption: talking about programming language so

03:10:12.799 --> 03:10:16.719
Caption: let&#39;s assume the spec is correct what

03:10:14.799 --> 03:10:17.679
Caption: can the programming language do to

03:10:16.719 --> 03:10:19.519
Caption: actually

03:10:17.679 --> 03:10:21.120
Caption: help you catch bugs before they even go

03:10:19.519 --> 03:10:22.639
Caption: out to production because it&#39;s a lot

03:10:21.120 --> 03:10:24.639
Caption: cheaper to catch them there and that&#39;s

03:10:22.639 --> 03:10:26.559
Caption: where type systems come in by the way

03:10:24.639 --> 03:10:29.040
Caption: this this graph really motivates this

03:10:26.559 --> 03:10:30.639
Caption: concept of shift left the idea of shift

03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:32.719
Caption: left testing is basically looking at

03:10:30.639 --> 03:10:34.478
Caption: this graph and saying with all these

03:10:32.719 --> 03:10:36.080
Caption: defects and bugs we want to shift to the

03:10:34.478 --> 03:10:38.799
Caption: left and catch them way earlier because

03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:40.959
Caption: it saves us a lot of trouble uh money

03:10:38.799 --> 03:10:43.120
Caption: and time so

03:10:40.959 --> 03:10:44.719
Caption: um there&#39;s a very very strong link

03:10:43.120 --> 03:10:46.719
Caption: between most people think of shift left

03:10:44.719 --> 03:10:48.318
Caption: as having better unit tests but i think

03:10:46.719 --> 03:10:50.160
Caption: there&#39;s a really strong link between the

03:10:48.319 --> 03:10:52.800
Caption: idea of shift left which is great and

03:10:50.160 --> 03:10:54.879
Caption: static type checking because

03:10:52.799 --> 03:10:56.160
Caption: type checks are tests

03:10:54.879 --> 03:10:57.679
Caption: they&#39;re tests that you don&#39;t have to

03:10:56.160 --> 03:10:59.200
Caption: write as separate unit tests but they

03:10:57.679 --> 03:11:01.040
Caption: will catch bugs for you before you even

03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:02.879
Caption: run the code

03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:04.879
Caption: so

03:11:02.879 --> 03:11:06.799
Caption: good would be

03:11:04.879 --> 03:11:07.839
Caption: that you run some sort of build tool and

03:11:06.799 --> 03:11:09.358
Caption: it tells you so i&#39;m looking at the top

03:11:07.839 --> 03:11:10.639
Caption: of the screen here and it says hey

03:11:09.359 --> 03:11:12.319
Caption: there&#39;s these errors in your code and

03:11:10.639 --> 03:11:14.159
Caption: you can&#39;t take it any further you can&#39;t

03:11:12.319 --> 03:11:15.919
Caption: run that program you can&#39;t release it to

03:11:14.160 --> 03:11:17.200
Caption: production you can&#39;t merge it to main

03:11:15.919 --> 03:11:18.478
Caption: that&#39;s great

03:11:17.200 --> 03:11:19.919
Caption: even better

03:11:18.478 --> 03:11:22.159
Caption: would be the middle one where as you&#39;re

03:11:19.919 --> 03:11:24.080
Caption: just typing in your ide it&#39;s already

03:11:22.160 --> 03:11:26.000
Caption: putting up a red squiggle and saying hey

03:11:24.080 --> 03:11:27.200
Caption: this isn&#39;t right so just as you&#39;re

03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:28.240
Caption: typing you&#39;re already learning that

03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:30.399
Caption: there&#39;s a bug and you fix it straight

03:11:28.240 --> 03:11:32.240
Caption: away super easy and cheap

03:11:30.399 --> 03:11:34.080
Caption: even better than that is before you&#39;ve

03:11:32.240 --> 03:11:37.200
Caption: even typed something it tells you what

03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:38.879
Caption: the options are so a lot of these powers

03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:41.680
Caption: are actually driven by static type

03:11:38.879 --> 03:11:43.438
Caption: systems all of this this intellisense in

03:11:41.679 --> 03:11:45.519
Caption: the bottom that it knows what the valid

03:11:43.439 --> 03:11:46.960
Caption: options are because of the type system

03:11:45.519 --> 03:11:49.599
Caption: that your programming language has built

03:11:46.959 --> 03:11:52.879
Caption: into it most of the time

03:11:49.599 --> 03:11:54.879
Caption: so these are really powerful things

03:11:52.879 --> 03:11:56.559
Caption: and type systems are getting really good

03:11:54.879 --> 03:11:58.719
Caption: so i think most of us are familiar with

03:11:56.559 --> 03:12:00.079
Caption: the old classics classes interfaces and

03:11:58.719 --> 03:12:01.839
Caption: then basic types like numbers and

03:12:00.080 --> 03:12:03.120
Caption: strings and booleans but if you look out

03:12:01.839 --> 03:12:04.160
Caption: there at all the programming languages

03:12:03.120 --> 03:12:06.000
Caption: that are being developed between

03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:07.600
Caption: research languages functional languages

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:09.200
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of languages out there and

03:12:07.599 --> 03:12:10.959
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of

03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:12.319
Caption: types some of them are actually not new

03:12:10.959 --> 03:12:13.679
Caption: like sum and product types have been

03:12:12.319 --> 03:12:15.120
Caption: around for decades in functional

03:12:13.679 --> 03:12:16.799
Caption: languages

03:12:15.120 --> 03:12:18.639
Caption: others are like at the bottom they&#39;re

03:12:16.799 --> 03:12:20.719
Caption: linear types and a fine types don&#39;t even

03:12:18.639 --> 03:12:23.919
Caption: ask me what that last one is um

03:12:20.719 --> 03:12:25.278
Caption: yeah they they can get pretty um

03:12:23.919 --> 03:12:26.000
Caption: tricky

03:12:25.279 --> 03:12:27.680
Caption: and

03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:28.959
Caption: but there&#39;s a there&#39;s a richness out

03:12:27.679 --> 03:12:30.160
Caption: there now

03:12:28.959 --> 03:12:31.519
Caption: so

03:12:30.160 --> 03:12:33.439
Caption: if you want to learn about some of those

03:12:31.519 --> 03:12:34.879
Caption: things like me uh putting on a talk

03:12:33.439 --> 03:12:36.960
Caption: where i feel like i should have some

03:12:34.879 --> 03:12:38.879
Caption: some sort of authority about it you can

03:12:36.959 --> 03:12:40.559
Caption: just go to youtube and start googling

03:12:38.879 --> 03:12:41.679
Caption: making illegal states unrepresentable

03:12:40.559 --> 03:12:43.519
Caption: and there&#39;s a whole bunch of videos and

03:12:41.679 --> 03:12:46.398
Caption: they&#39;ll often be talking about type

03:12:43.519 --> 03:12:47.919
Caption: system solutions to this problem of

03:12:46.399 --> 03:12:50.080
Caption: you know making illegal states

03:12:47.919 --> 03:12:52.959
Caption: unrepresentable basically means the type

03:12:50.080 --> 03:12:55.679
Caption: system should pick up errors straight

03:12:52.959 --> 03:12:57.120
Caption: away if you&#39;ve specified

03:12:55.679 --> 03:12:59.040
Caption: i don&#39;t know um

03:12:57.120 --> 03:13:00.719
Caption: first user first name middle name last

03:12:59.040 --> 03:13:02.639
Caption: name first and last name are required

03:13:00.719 --> 03:13:05.358
Caption: middle name is optional if you can say

03:13:02.639 --> 03:13:07.120
Caption: in the type system that if that

03:13:05.359 --> 03:13:08.319
Caption: intent and you can see it in the code

03:13:07.120 --> 03:13:10.879
Caption: then you&#39;ll catch that error straight

03:13:08.319 --> 03:13:11.840
Caption: away if if nulls are just implicit in

03:13:10.879 --> 03:13:14.240
Caption: all

03:13:11.839 --> 03:13:15.679
Caption: in all strings then you can&#39;t specify

03:13:14.240 --> 03:13:18.080
Caption: that intent in the code and you can&#39;t

03:13:15.679 --> 03:13:19.438
Caption: catch that that error until you write a

03:13:18.080 --> 03:13:20.799
Caption: unit test for it or it goes out to

03:13:19.439 --> 03:13:22.160
Caption: production and crashes

03:13:20.799 --> 03:13:23.919
Caption: so that&#39;s what that&#39;s what we&#39;re really

03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:26.080
Caption: talking about making illegal states

03:13:23.919 --> 03:13:30.398
Caption: unrepresentable it&#39;s a type system thing

03:13:26.080 --> 03:13:32.560
Caption: usually um it can go pretty far so in my

03:13:30.399 --> 03:13:34.399
Caption: wanderings i came across this video and

03:13:32.559 --> 03:13:36.238
Caption: i thought oh there&#39;s a there&#39;s a typo in

03:13:34.399 --> 03:13:37.439
Caption: the in the video name and then i

03:13:36.239 --> 03:13:40.640
Caption: actually started watching the video by

03:13:37.439 --> 03:13:42.399
Caption: the way ats is a research functional

03:13:40.639 --> 03:13:44.719
Caption: language that implements

03:13:42.399 --> 03:13:47.279
Caption: linear types and they can do amazing

03:13:44.719 --> 03:13:49.358
Caption: things but the guy says in the first

03:13:47.279 --> 03:13:51.200
Caption: sentence of his talk he says by the way

03:13:49.359 --> 03:13:54.239
Caption: that&#39;s not a typo i actually meant to

03:13:51.200 --> 03:13:55.919
Caption: say a tase of ats like he said you know

03:13:54.239 --> 03:13:57.839
Caption: it&#39;s so difficult to get right that it&#39;s

03:13:55.919 --> 03:14:00.000
Caption: like being tased um

03:13:57.839 --> 03:14:02.160
Caption: so you know types there&#39;s a trade-off

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:04.639
Caption: again there&#39;s a trade-off they can be

03:14:02.160 --> 03:14:06.160
Caption: really super powerful but they also mean

03:14:04.639 --> 03:14:08.000
Caption: you know you might add complexity to the

03:14:06.160 --> 03:14:09.520
Caption: development process along the way

03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:11.200
Caption: uh that brings us to typescript which is

03:14:09.519 --> 03:14:13.278
Caption: a language i really love

03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:14.399
Caption: type typescript is basically making a

03:14:13.279 --> 03:14:15.680
Caption: lot of these advanced types go

03:14:14.399 --> 03:14:17.680
Caption: mainstream

03:14:15.679 --> 03:14:19.599
Caption: because they set as a design goal to

03:14:17.679 --> 03:14:21.599
Caption: statically identify constructs that are

03:14:19.599 --> 03:14:24.799
Caption: likely to be errors

03:14:21.599 --> 03:14:26.639
Caption: in code that already existed in massive

03:14:24.799 --> 03:14:28.239
Caption: quantities javascript was already out

03:14:26.639 --> 03:14:30.879
Caption: there lots of libraries were already out

03:14:28.239 --> 03:14:32.479
Caption: there they said how could we actually

03:14:30.879 --> 03:14:33.599
Caption: analyze code that already exists that

03:14:32.478 --> 03:14:35.919
Caption: people are already writing with all

03:14:33.599 --> 03:14:38.238
Caption: sorts of patterns and

03:14:35.919 --> 03:14:39.759
Caption: add this layer over the top of that a

03:14:38.239 --> 03:14:42.560
Caption: type system it&#39;s a superset of

03:14:39.759 --> 03:14:44.238
Caption: javascript that can actually detect

03:14:42.559 --> 03:14:46.079
Caption: where there&#39;s errors in the code there&#39;s

03:14:44.239 --> 03:14:47.839
Caption: the low-hanging fruit like just spotting

03:14:46.080 --> 03:14:50.319
Caption: typos in property names that&#39;s pretty

03:14:47.839 --> 03:14:52.160
Caption: easy right but as the project has

03:14:50.319 --> 03:14:55.439
Caption: evolved and matured they&#39;ve added some

03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:55.439
Caption: amazing abilities

03:14:55.919 --> 03:14:59.120
Caption: we&#39;re at the point now in typescript

03:14:57.519 --> 03:15:02.559
Caption: where it&#39;s probably easier to think of

03:14:59.120 --> 03:15:04.560
Caption: the type system as itself a separate

03:15:02.559 --> 03:15:05.919
Caption: programming language

03:15:04.559 --> 03:15:07.599
Caption: as a programming language i would

03:15:05.919 --> 03:15:09.120
Caption: describe it as a dsl or a domain

03:15:07.599 --> 03:15:10.639
Caption: specific language it&#39;s a language really

03:15:09.120 --> 03:15:12.719
Caption: specifically for

03:15:10.639 --> 03:15:14.559
Caption: checking types for inferring checking

03:15:12.719 --> 03:15:16.639
Caption: and proving that certain type

03:15:14.559 --> 03:15:18.719
Caption: relationships hold

03:15:16.639 --> 03:15:20.959
Caption: as a language it&#39;s also a purely

03:15:18.719 --> 03:15:22.879
Caption: functional language with no side effects

03:15:20.959 --> 03:15:24.000
Caption: and it&#39;s also turing complete so you can

03:15:22.879 --> 03:15:26.239
Caption: actually compute anything that&#39;s

03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:27.519
Caption: computable purely at compile time in the

03:15:26.239 --> 03:15:28.799
Caption: type system

03:15:27.519 --> 03:15:31.599
Caption: so

03:15:28.799 --> 03:15:33.438
Caption: a pro of that is that it&#39;s it really

03:15:31.599 --> 03:15:35.438
Caption: enables you to set up really really

03:15:33.439 --> 03:15:37.120
Caption: really specific static checks so you can

03:15:35.439 --> 03:15:38.640
Caption: shift left in all kinds of ways you can

03:15:37.120 --> 03:15:40.319
Caption: catch a lot of errors before you even

03:15:38.639 --> 03:15:41.358
Caption: run the program because static checks at

03:15:40.319 --> 03:15:43.279
Caption: the end of the day are things that you

03:15:41.359 --> 03:15:45.520
Caption: can identify just from looking at source

03:15:43.279 --> 03:15:48.319
Caption: code you don&#39;t even have to run it

03:15:45.519 --> 03:15:50.959
Caption: a downside of type systems that are this

03:15:48.319 --> 03:15:52.479
Caption: this rich is that they tend to have some

03:15:50.959 --> 03:15:54.239
Caption: pretty weird syntax that&#39;s not familiar

03:15:52.478 --> 03:15:55.599
Caption: to us and in typescript case it&#39;s really

03:15:54.239 --> 03:15:57.279
Caption: interesting because a lot of the types

03:15:55.599 --> 03:16:00.159
Caption: they actually have the same syntax as

03:15:57.279 --> 03:16:02.640
Caption: the the runtime code it mirrors but not

03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:03.919
Caption: perfectly so you&#39;ve really got a sort of

03:16:02.639 --> 03:16:05.919
Caption: you&#39;ve got that cognitive load of

03:16:03.919 --> 03:16:06.959
Caption: learning two sets of things and a lot of

03:16:05.919 --> 03:16:09.438
Caption: i think for a lot of people they don&#39;t

03:16:06.959 --> 03:16:11.438
Caption: even recognize um the same control flow

03:16:09.439 --> 03:16:14.000
Caption: constructs in the type system as in the

03:16:11.439 --> 03:16:17.279
Caption: runtime system but they&#39;re all there

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:19.120
Caption: um i just grabbed one quick example of

03:16:17.279 --> 03:16:20.959
Caption: the typescript blog and i just modified

03:16:19.120 --> 03:16:22.399
Caption: it a little bit for this talk but this

03:16:20.959 --> 03:16:25.200
Caption: is basically off their blog so it&#39;s not

03:16:22.399 --> 03:16:26.959
Caption: a super complicated one but in in

03:16:25.200 --> 03:16:28.719
Caption: javascript you might just want to have a

03:16:26.959 --> 03:16:30.319
Caption: a simple object watcher where you could

03:16:28.719 --> 03:16:33.040
Caption: pass in an object with some properties

03:16:30.319 --> 03:16:34.560
Caption: in it and it will return to you a

03:16:33.040 --> 03:16:35.919
Caption: version of that object that&#39;s still got

03:16:34.559 --> 03:16:38.478
Caption: the original properties but it&#39;s got a

03:16:35.919 --> 03:16:40.080
Caption: couple of callback methods that you can

03:16:38.478 --> 03:16:42.079
Caption: attach a callback to and that will be

03:16:40.080 --> 03:16:43.200
Caption: called when one of those properties

03:16:42.080 --> 03:16:45.120
Caption: changes

03:16:43.200 --> 03:16:47.200
Caption: so i&#39;ve got an example there if you gave

03:16:45.120 --> 03:16:48.879
Caption: it a just an object with an x and a y in

03:16:47.200 --> 03:16:50.640
Caption: their numbers it would give you back an

03:16:48.879 --> 03:16:52.319
Caption: object with the x and the y but also

03:16:50.639 --> 03:16:53.599
Caption: it&#39;s got an x changed method and a y

03:16:52.319 --> 03:16:56.080
Caption: changed method and you could put your

03:16:53.599 --> 03:16:58.639
Caption: callback in there and get notified if x

03:16:56.080 --> 03:17:00.799
Caption: changed to y change super cool and this

03:16:58.639 --> 03:17:02.639
Caption: is a dynamic language so it would accept

03:17:00.799 --> 03:17:05.358
Caption: any object you like and it will set up

03:17:02.639 --> 03:17:06.398
Caption: different different properties depending

03:17:05.359 --> 03:17:09.040
Caption: um

03:17:06.399 --> 03:17:09.040
Caption: depending on

03:17:09.439 --> 03:17:13.040
Caption: what those what those property names

03:17:11.040 --> 03:17:14.559
Caption: were so we could express the runtime

03:17:13.040 --> 03:17:16.160
Caption: code and that&#39;s what that

03:17:14.559 --> 03:17:17.599
Caption: make watch object does i haven&#39;t put the

03:17:16.160 --> 03:17:18.799
Caption: runtime code there like that&#39;s something

03:17:17.599 --> 03:17:21.919
Caption: that most of us could probably figure

03:17:18.799 --> 03:17:23.278
Caption: out um but the bottom part is a type so

03:17:21.919 --> 03:17:25.279
Caption: we&#39;ve basically got a type level

03:17:23.279 --> 03:17:27.120
Caption: function here and we&#39;re mapping from

03:17:25.279 --> 03:17:29.040
Caption: this the type of the source object which

03:17:27.120 --> 03:17:30.160
Caption: typescript can see because if you pass

03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:32.719
Caption: in an object there it can see what

03:17:30.160 --> 03:17:34.160
Caption: properties it&#39;s got and it&#39;s going to to

03:17:32.719 --> 03:17:36.080
Caption: it&#39;s basically a function running at the

03:17:34.160 --> 03:17:37.759
Caption: type level it&#39;s going to actually call a

03:17:36.080 --> 03:17:39.200
Caption: few other type level functions to do a

03:17:37.759 --> 03:17:40.478
Caption: calculation of what these new property

03:17:39.200 --> 03:17:42.799
Caption: names are going to be

03:17:40.478 --> 03:17:45.519
Caption: and what their types are and

03:17:42.799 --> 03:17:47.679
Caption: return that as the output type so that

03:17:45.519 --> 03:17:49.919
Caption: that type is actually used

03:17:47.679 --> 03:17:51.120
Caption: where it says t and i won&#39;t go into the

03:17:49.919 --> 03:17:52.719
Caption: details of that but it&#39;s basically a

03:17:51.120 --> 03:17:54.479
Caption: type level function so it can do the

03:17:52.719 --> 03:17:56.398
Caption: same computation statically as the

03:17:54.478 --> 03:17:58.000
Caption: program is doing dynamically

03:17:56.399 --> 03:17:59.120
Caption: so the way that works in practice is

03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:00.879
Caption: that you can say hey i want to make a

03:17:59.120 --> 03:18:04.560
Caption: watched object with first name last name

03:18:00.879 --> 03:18:06.478
Caption: and age um so if i now go person dot on

03:18:04.559 --> 03:18:08.559
Caption: i realize now that my my previous slide

03:18:06.478 --> 03:18:10.238
Caption: had an error and the the callback that

03:18:08.559 --> 03:18:11.839
Caption: it adds is on but it&#39;s strongly tight

03:18:10.239 --> 03:18:14.080
Caption: for the different um strings that you

03:18:11.839 --> 03:18:16.799
Caption: could pass into it so i want to listen

03:18:14.080 --> 03:18:18.160
Caption: for changes um first name changed and

03:18:16.799 --> 03:18:20.239
Caption: then you can supply your callback that&#39;s

03:18:18.160 --> 03:18:22.160
Caption: fine because that&#39;s valid the second two

03:18:20.239 --> 03:18:24.000
Caption: they&#39;re errors because the first one

03:18:22.160 --> 03:18:25.520
Caption: saying well this you can&#39;t say first

03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:27.439
Caption: name has to be first name change and the

03:18:25.519 --> 03:18:28.879
Caption: second one is just a plain old typo so

03:18:27.439 --> 03:18:30.080
Caption: those are things that before they would

03:18:28.879 --> 03:18:31.279
Caption: have just only been discovered at

03:18:30.080 --> 03:18:33.040
Caption: runtime and now you can find them at

03:18:31.279 --> 03:18:34.800
Caption: compile time and not only that it&#39;s not

03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:36.160
Caption: rigid you don&#39;t have to set up separate

03:18:34.799 --> 03:18:38.000
Caption: types for every possible different

03:18:36.160 --> 03:18:40.160
Caption: object it&#39;s like whatever the shape of

03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:41.759
Caption: the object is it will do a type level

03:18:40.160 --> 03:18:43.279
Caption: function work out what the

03:18:41.759 --> 03:18:45.358
Caption: shape of this watched object that

03:18:43.279 --> 03:18:47.359
Caption: corresponds to will be and this kind of

03:18:45.359 --> 03:18:49.520
Caption: thing this is a simple example but with

03:18:47.359 --> 03:18:50.880
Caption: typescript you can go way beyond that i

03:18:49.519 --> 03:18:54.238
Caption: would love to do

03:18:50.879 --> 03:18:57.519
Caption: a talk on more thing cover more things

03:18:54.239 --> 03:18:59.520
Caption: like web servers for example

03:18:57.519 --> 03:19:01.759
Caption: um finally has everyone got their

03:18:59.519 --> 03:19:02.879
Caption: popcorn ready

03:19:01.759 --> 03:19:04.799
Caption: oo

03:19:02.879 --> 03:19:05.839
Caption: versus fp

03:19:04.799 --> 03:19:07.278
Caption: so

03:19:05.839 --> 03:19:10.239
Caption: if this was a conference this would be

03:19:07.279 --> 03:19:12.959
Caption: such an interesting and um controversial

03:19:10.239 --> 03:19:14.560
Caption: topic i think that um language paradigms

03:19:12.959 --> 03:19:15.679
Caption: which we haven&#39;t really cut touched on

03:19:14.559 --> 03:19:16.959
Caption: yet that would be covered here language

03:19:15.679 --> 03:19:19.599
Caption: paradigms is the closest thing our

03:19:16.959 --> 03:19:21.359
Caption: industry has to religions

03:19:19.599 --> 03:19:22.799
Caption: it&#39;s very dangerous to you know you&#39;ve

03:19:21.359 --> 03:19:24.560
Caption: got to watch what you say

03:19:22.799 --> 03:19:25.919
Caption: fortunately for me i realized in running

Caption: little five minute window you really

03:19:37.120 --> 03:19:40.160

03:19:39.519 --> 03:19:42.799
Caption: to

03:19:40.160 --> 03:19:44.000

03:19:42.799 --> 03:19:45.278
Caption: that&#39;s something that you guys are

03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:46.799

03:19:45.279 --> 03:19:48.720
Caption: ddd next year

03:19:46.799 --> 03:19:50.318
Caption: um i thought though you know i should at

03:19:48.719 --> 03:19:53.278

03:19:50.319 --> 03:19:54.640

03:19:53.279 --> 03:19:56.080

03:19:54.639 --> 03:19:57.839
Caption: super easy to find them for object

03:19:56.080 --> 03:19:59.839

03:19:57.839 --> 03:20:01.438

03:20:04.319 --> 03:20:06.959

03:20:06.959 --> 03:20:10.080
Caption: in a nutshell

03:20:08.959 --> 03:20:11.438
Caption: the things we&#39;re interested in

03:20:10.080 --> 03:20:12.879
Caption: programming language design in ways that

03:20:11.439 --> 03:20:14.640
Caption: it can actually make our lives better

03:20:12.879 --> 03:20:16.639
Caption: and easier and safer

03:20:14.639 --> 03:20:18.398
Caption: is convenience we want less of these

03:20:16.639 --> 03:20:19.839
Caption: rabbit holes where you get lost trying

03:20:18.399 --> 03:20:21.920
Caption: to find a good solution we want

03:20:19.839 --> 03:20:23.919
Caption: convenience that we can express things

03:20:21.919 --> 03:20:26.000
Caption: at a high level in a reasonable amount

03:20:23.919 --> 03:20:28.319
Caption: of time and the way we do that is by

03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:30.879
Caption: leveling up human capabilities by taking

03:20:28.319 --> 03:20:33.040
Caption: into account human weaknesses

03:20:30.879 --> 03:20:34.959
Caption: correctness we just want to like squeeze

03:20:33.040 --> 03:20:36.799
Caption: bugs out of the system by design make

03:20:34.959 --> 03:20:38.160
Caption: them less possible to even express by

03:20:36.799 --> 03:20:40.000
Caption: shifting left

03:20:38.160 --> 03:20:41.679
Caption: and in particular with expressive type

03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:43.200
Caption: systems and i think when it come i

03:20:41.679 --> 03:20:44.879
Caption: pitched that we&#39;d look at things that

03:20:43.200 --> 03:20:46.239
Caption: will emerge in the future this is a big

03:20:44.879 --> 03:20:48.799
Caption: area where i think there&#39;s a lot of work

03:20:46.239 --> 03:20:50.720
Caption: going on in programming language design

03:20:48.799 --> 03:20:52.959
Caption: and finally we need to embrace

03:20:50.719 --> 03:20:55.040
Caption: trade-offs so different languages

03:20:52.959 --> 03:20:56.000
Caption: express some things better than others

03:20:55.040 --> 03:20:57.279
Caption: and

03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:59.040
Caption: i think it&#39;s going to always remain the

03:20:57.279 --> 03:21:01.439
Caption: case that we should choose the the best

03:20:59.040 --> 03:21:05.719
Caption: programming language for the job

03:21:01.439 --> 03:21:05.720
Caption: and that&#39;s it thank you very much

03:21:11.919 --> 03:21:16.160

Caption: so

03:21:28.639 --> 03:21:35.000

03:21:45.519 --> 03:21:49.759
Caption: question if you

03:21:47.279 --> 03:21:51.520
Caption: hello okay that&#39;s better um what do you

03:21:49.759 --> 03:21:53.599
Caption: think drives some people to be so

03:21:51.519 --> 03:21:55.759
Caption: emotionally attached to a certain

03:21:53.599 --> 03:21:57.438
Caption: paradigm or a certain language

03:21:55.759 --> 03:21:59.519
Caption: if you&#39;ve seen it happen well i think

03:21:57.439 --> 03:22:01.279
Caption: it&#39;s a like a bit of a minefield even

03:21:59.519 --> 03:22:03.759
Caption: discussing it because i said i made an

03:22:01.279 --> 03:22:05.760
Caption: analogy to religion and there&#39;s probably

03:22:03.759 --> 03:22:08.799
Caption: that there&#39;s a deep analogy there so i

03:22:05.759 --> 03:22:10.639
Caption: would say um some sometimes it&#39;s

03:22:08.799 --> 03:22:12.559
Caption: you&#39;ve you&#39;ve grown up knowing one thing

03:22:10.639 --> 03:22:13.599
Caption: all your life and it&#39;s very difficult to

03:22:12.559 --> 03:22:16.719
Caption: hear

03:22:13.599 --> 03:22:16.719
Caption: things that say you&#39;re wrong

03:22:17.200 --> 03:22:22.959
Caption: and or even if you came to a certain way

03:22:20.319 --> 03:22:25.040
Caption: of say developing software in a certain

03:22:22.959 --> 03:22:28.799
Caption: paradigm yourself you may have invested

03:22:25.040 --> 03:22:30.959
Caption: a lot in in doing it that way and

03:22:28.799 --> 03:22:32.879
Caption: maybe people with really different views

03:22:30.959 --> 03:22:34.959
Caption: from you just

03:22:32.879 --> 03:22:36.478
Caption: you know it&#39;s risky to to embrace new

03:22:34.959 --> 03:22:37.839
Caption: ideas sometimes because you&#39;ve invested

03:22:36.478 --> 03:22:39.599
Caption: a lot in what you already know and

03:22:37.839 --> 03:22:41.358
Caption: typically no idea is perfect so you can

03:22:39.599 --> 03:22:43.040
Caption: always point flaws in the other people&#39;s

03:22:41.359 --> 03:22:44.479
Caption: way of looking at the world

03:22:43.040 --> 03:22:47.359
Caption: so a little bit of resistance to change

03:22:44.478 --> 03:22:49.839
Caption: in fear of the unknown i think so yeah

03:22:47.359 --> 03:22:49.840
Caption: thanks

03:22:50.399 --> 03:22:53.200

04:50:48.240 --> 04:50:53.041
Caption: we got a little problem

04:50:50.957 --> 04:50:54.558
Caption: as you know our motto is you need a

04:50:53.039 --> 04:50:55.919
Caption: professional bodyguard delivered to your

04:50:54.560 --> 04:50:58.240
Caption: door in less than half an hour you&#39;ve

04:50:55.919 --> 04:51:00.480
Caption: got it buddy but without an app ain&#39;t no

04:50:58.240 --> 04:51:03.201
Caption: bodyguard getting delivered nowhere so

04:51:00.480 --> 04:51:06.638
Caption: where are we with that uh the app is

04:51:03.199 --> 04:51:07.679
Caption: almost ready uh we just need

04:51:06.638 --> 04:51:09.839
Caption: three

04:51:07.679 --> 04:51:11.679
Caption: more days we need it asap

04:51:09.839 --> 04:51:13.679
Caption: okay team what&#39;s the status on the app

04:51:11.679 --> 04:51:16.000
Caption: we&#39;re good to go except our login

04:51:13.679 --> 04:51:17.919
Caption: experience is a disaster

04:51:16.000 --> 04:51:19.759
Caption: we need something to keep our users data

04:51:17.919 --> 04:51:22.400
Caption: private

04:51:19.759 --> 04:51:24.320
Caption: and to keep the hackers out

04:51:22.400 --> 04:51:26.560
Caption: and it needs to work flawlessly because

04:51:24.320 --> 04:51:28.798
Caption: because i don&#39;t want to lose one single

04:51:26.560 --> 04:51:31.041
Caption: customer i hear you so let&#39;s use off

04:51:28.798 --> 04:51:33.361
Caption: zero off what now off zero it&#39;s an

04:51:31.039 --> 04:51:35.039
Caption: identity platform fast easy logins just

04:51:33.359 --> 04:51:36.558
Caption: what the boss wants can we make our own

04:51:35.039 --> 04:51:37.679
Caption: authentication service come on the

04:51:36.560 --> 04:51:39.041
Caption: ultimate key master you know we don&#39;t

04:51:37.679 --> 04:51:40.876
Caption: have that kind of time we need to

04:51:39.039 --> 04:51:42.716
Caption: confirm identities with passwords

04:51:40.878 --> 04:51:44.240
Caption: fingerprint scans whatever the users

04:51:42.718 --> 04:51:45.839
Caption: like to use observer can do that yeah

04:51:44.240 --> 04:51:47.519
Caption: but it needs to be secure we can&#39;t have

04:51:45.839 --> 04:51:48.876
Caption: our app compromised by breaches not a

04:51:47.519 --> 04:51:50.240
Caption: problem and it needs to scale if we get

04:51:48.878 --> 04:51:52.240
Caption: hit with a ton of traffic and if it

04:51:50.240 --> 04:51:53.769
Caption: stalls or freezes up i will get fired we

04:51:52.240 --> 04:52:03.330
Caption: can do this

04:51:53.769 --> 04:52:03.330
Caption: [Music]

04:56:12.320 --> 04:56:16.798
Caption: today so uh this is a little talk i&#39;ve

04:56:14.480 --> 04:56:19.121
Caption: been developing across a number of

04:56:16.798 --> 04:56:19.121
Caption: different

04:56:19.199 --> 04:56:22.796
Caption: engagements in my previous life i was a

04:56:21.359 --> 04:56:25.599
Caption: consultant so i did a lot of

04:56:22.798 --> 04:56:27.601
Caption: architecture diagramming and um

04:56:25.599 --> 04:56:30.320
Caption: the various likes

04:56:27.599 --> 04:56:32.636
Caption: uh so thank you for joining me um first

04:56:30.320 --> 04:56:34.240
Caption: off thank you to all the sponsors today

04:56:32.638 --> 04:56:36.160
Caption: wouldn&#39;t be possible without them all so

04:56:34.240 --> 04:56:39.121
Caption: it&#39;s really appreciated i know they they

04:56:36.160 --> 04:56:40.958
Caption: rock up year after year um so yeah

04:56:39.119 --> 04:56:42.478
Caption: really appreciate them

04:56:40.957 --> 04:56:44.796
Caption: um so i thought i&#39;d start off with a

04:56:42.480 --> 04:56:46.958
Caption: quote architecture represents the

04:56:44.798 --> 04:56:48.080
Caption: significant design decisions that shape

04:56:46.957 --> 04:56:50.318
Caption: a system

04:56:48.080 --> 04:56:52.000
Caption: where significance is measured by the

04:56:50.320 --> 04:56:53.599
Caption: cost of change

04:56:52.000 --> 04:56:56.320
Caption: and the really important part here for

04:56:53.599 --> 04:56:58.560
Caption: me is that last

04:56:56.320 --> 04:57:00.638
Caption: part of the sentence significant is

04:56:58.560 --> 04:57:02.320
Caption: measured by the cost of change

04:57:00.638 --> 04:57:04.560
Caption: these decisions in your architecture

04:57:02.320 --> 04:57:05.599
Caption: diagrams in your architecture

04:57:04.560 --> 04:57:07.679
Caption: um

04:57:05.599 --> 04:57:08.560
Caption: you know they have a cost associated

04:57:07.679 --> 04:57:11.199
Caption: with them

04:57:08.560 --> 04:57:12.958
Caption: changing them is not as simple as just

04:57:11.199 --> 04:57:15.199
Caption: swapping a component now generally

04:57:12.957 --> 04:57:17.439
Caption: speaking maybe you&#39;ve got micro services

04:57:15.199 --> 04:57:20.080
Caption: and it is easy but generally speaking

04:57:17.439 --> 04:57:23.199
Caption: they&#39;re quite complex tasks

04:57:20.080 --> 04:57:25.199
Caption: so i really like that quote it&#39;s a great

04:57:23.199 --> 04:57:26.318
Caption: setting um

04:57:25.199 --> 04:57:28.160
Caption: so

04:57:26.320 --> 04:57:30.160
Caption: onto diagrams who&#39;s

04:57:28.160 --> 04:57:31.759
Caption: audience audience participation who&#39;s

04:57:30.160 --> 04:57:33.359
Caption: done a diagram before who&#39;s done an

04:57:31.759 --> 04:57:34.160
Caption: architecture one

04:57:33.359 --> 04:57:35.359
Caption: nice

04:57:34.160 --> 04:57:36.958
Caption: how many of you have done it on a

04:57:35.359 --> 04:57:38.876
Caption: whiteboard

04:57:36.957 --> 04:57:40.716
Caption: mostly on a whiteboard yeah how many

04:57:38.878 --> 04:57:42.878
Caption: have done like more professional used a

04:57:40.718 --> 04:57:44.400
Caption: bit of software and had to store it in

04:57:42.878 --> 04:57:45.921
Caption: the system where everyone references

04:57:44.400 --> 04:57:49.201
Caption: cool so we&#39;re all pretty familiar with

04:57:45.919 --> 04:57:50.400
Caption: architecture diagrams then um so some

04:57:49.199 --> 04:57:51.599
Caption: examples

04:57:50.400 --> 04:57:52.718
Caption: uh

04:57:51.599 --> 04:57:54.080
Caption: this one

04:57:52.718 --> 04:57:56.480
Caption: lots of boxes

04:57:54.080 --> 04:57:58.000
Caption: barely any labels there&#39;s

04:57:56.480 --> 04:57:59.201
Caption: a bunch of arrows in the middle there

04:57:58.000 --> 04:58:00.878
Caption: that are so

04:57:59.199 --> 04:58:02.796
Caption: close together you can&#39;t even see where

04:58:00.878 --> 04:58:04.320
Caption: they&#39;re going um

04:58:02.798 --> 04:58:05.601
Caption: i&#39;m probably guilty of doing this at

04:58:04.320 --> 04:58:08.638
Caption: some point in time there&#39;s been some

04:58:05.599 --> 04:58:10.160
Caption: complex systems in the past

04:58:08.638 --> 04:58:12.080
Caption: but overall you don&#39;t get a great

04:58:10.160 --> 04:58:13.121
Caption: picture of what&#39;s going on here

04:58:12.080 --> 04:58:15.119
Caption: there&#39;s

04:58:13.119 --> 04:58:17.759
Caption: lots of lots of pretty colors and lots

04:58:15.119 --> 04:58:19.679
Caption: of a few arrows but not much else to

04:58:17.759 --> 04:58:21.839
Caption: really tell you what this system does or

04:58:19.679 --> 04:58:23.679
Caption: how it behaves

04:58:21.839 --> 04:58:25.519
Caption: uh what about this one

04:58:23.679 --> 04:58:27.279
Caption: same sort of thing um it&#39;s a little bit

04:58:25.519 --> 04:58:29.919
Caption: more spread out so it&#39;s got that going

04:58:27.279 --> 04:58:32.318
Caption: for it um a bit better use of colors

04:58:29.919 --> 04:58:33.439
Caption: objectively maybe perhaps

04:58:32.320 --> 04:58:35.599
Caption: um

04:58:33.439 --> 04:58:37.119
Caption: a few more labels again perhaps there&#39;s

04:58:35.599 --> 04:58:38.957
Caption: there&#39;s actually a label on one of the

04:58:37.119 --> 04:58:41.039
Caption: arrows there which

04:58:38.957 --> 04:58:43.119
Caption: may or may not be useful to you

04:58:41.039 --> 04:58:44.636
Caption: but at the end of the day it&#39;s still

04:58:43.119 --> 04:58:45.599
Caption: kind of difficult to see what&#39;s going on

04:58:44.638 --> 04:58:47.121
Caption: with this

04:58:45.599 --> 04:58:48.000
Caption: architecture diagram

04:58:47.119 --> 04:58:50.398
Caption: um

04:58:48.000 --> 04:58:53.359
Caption: and then lastly i have this pretty

04:58:50.400 --> 04:58:55.201
Caption: whiteboard drawing um this is probably

04:58:53.359 --> 04:58:57.039
Caption: honestly the best out of all of them

04:58:55.199 --> 04:59:00.080
Caption: it&#39;s even got some users in there down

04:58:57.039 --> 04:59:02.318
Caption: the bottom in green uh lots of the the

04:59:00.080 --> 04:59:03.519
Caption: arrows and the data flow is actually

04:59:02.320 --> 04:59:05.359
Caption: labeled

04:59:03.519 --> 04:59:06.876
Caption: um

04:59:05.359 --> 04:59:08.636
Caption: but yeah they&#39;re all at the end of the

04:59:06.878 --> 04:59:10.480
Caption: day they&#39;re all just boxes

04:59:08.638 --> 04:59:12.560
Caption: that&#39;s boring what the hell are these

04:59:10.480 --> 04:59:16.160
Caption: compo what are these actual components

04:59:12.560 --> 04:59:19.281
Caption: is it like a an ec2 box running a

04:59:16.160 --> 04:59:21.359
Caption: java spring boot or is it a lambda micro

04:59:19.279 --> 04:59:23.439
Caption: service like what&#39;s actually going on in

04:59:21.359 --> 04:59:25.199
Caption: this architecture who knows

04:59:23.439 --> 04:59:27.839
Caption: um so

04:59:25.199 --> 04:59:29.119
Caption: stop it don&#39;t do it anymore

04:59:27.839 --> 04:59:31.359
Caption: don&#39;t like it

04:59:29.119 --> 04:59:32.796
Caption: um

04:59:31.359 --> 04:59:34.320
Caption: this is a slide that i didn&#39;t delete

04:59:32.798 --> 04:59:35.031
Caption: when i was meant to so let&#39;s skip that

04:59:34.320 --> 04:59:36.798
Caption: one

04:59:35.029 --> 04:59:38.558
Caption: [Music]

04:59:36.798 --> 04:59:40.560
Caption: my purging last night clearly missed a

04:59:38.560 --> 04:59:41.759
Caption: slide um so i wanted to talk through a

04:59:40.560 --> 04:59:43.759
Caption: scenario because i thought that was the

04:59:41.759 --> 04:59:45.439
Caption: best way to kind of illustrate how we

04:59:43.759 --> 04:59:48.000
Caption: might go about designing better

04:59:45.439 --> 04:59:50.080
Caption: architecture diagrams so i came up with

04:59:48.000 --> 04:59:53.039
Caption: a cannery don&#39;t ask me why my brain

04:59:50.080 --> 04:59:54.798
Caption: works in weird ways uh so

04:59:53.039 --> 04:59:56.398
Caption: products are randomly sampled as they go

04:59:54.798 --> 04:59:58.878
Caption: along the conveyor belt they&#39;re tested

04:59:56.400 --> 05:00:00.320
Caption: for anomalies and we take some action

04:59:58.878 --> 05:00:03.201
Caption: right so there&#39;s there&#39;s something that

05:00:00.320 --> 05:00:05.281
Caption: does that randomly random sampling uh

05:00:03.199 --> 05:00:08.398
Caption: there&#39;s something that detects that

05:00:05.279 --> 05:00:10.478
Caption: random sample event and actually makes a

05:00:08.400 --> 05:00:12.400
Caption: change in the system we have to

05:00:10.480 --> 05:00:13.441
Caption: do something to take that sample from

05:00:12.400 --> 05:00:14.638
Caption: the

05:00:13.439 --> 05:00:16.000
Caption: product

05:00:14.638 --> 05:00:18.160
Caption: and then we get results back we get a

05:00:16.000 --> 05:00:20.957
Caption: pass or fail from that sample and again

05:00:18.160 --> 05:00:22.958
Caption: we have to take action um

05:00:20.957 --> 05:00:24.796
Caption: if it fails if it&#39;s good then we

05:00:22.957 --> 05:00:27.679
Caption: continue doing whatever it is a cannery

05:00:24.798 --> 05:00:29.841
Caption: does and we profit hopefully

05:00:27.679 --> 05:00:31.759
Caption: uh so

05:00:29.839 --> 05:00:34.560
Caption: this is a plausible architecture right

05:00:31.759 --> 05:00:36.080
Caption: it&#39;s not a good one i&#39;ll give you that

05:00:34.560 --> 05:00:37.679
Caption: but it&#39;s a plausible architecture we

05:00:36.080 --> 05:00:39.679
Caption: have a sensor

05:00:37.679 --> 05:00:41.279
Caption: it&#39;s sending some sort of data to a

05:00:39.679 --> 05:00:43.359
Caption: sampling engine there we have a pretty

05:00:41.279 --> 05:00:45.519
Caption: box the box i said don&#39;t do because

05:00:43.359 --> 05:00:47.599
Caption: boxes are not good

05:00:45.519 --> 05:00:51.359
Caption: if the sample fails

05:00:47.599 --> 05:00:53.039
Caption: it goes around to a staff member

05:00:51.359 --> 05:00:55.919
Caption: don&#39;t know what sort of staff member is

05:00:53.039 --> 05:00:57.599
Caption: it the cleaner or is it the manager like

05:00:55.919 --> 05:01:00.000
Caption: who we actually sending that to is it

05:00:57.599 --> 05:01:01.679
Caption: the ceo that gets the message

05:01:00.000 --> 05:01:03.519
Caption: um and then

05:01:01.679 --> 05:01:04.716
Caption: the staff member sends something back to

05:01:03.519 --> 05:01:06.636
Caption: the senate what are they sending back to

05:01:04.718 --> 05:01:08.160
Caption: the sensor um

05:01:06.638 --> 05:01:10.718
Caption: there&#39;s not a lot of information going

05:01:08.160 --> 05:01:12.160
Caption: on here but

05:01:10.718 --> 05:01:13.681
Caption: i can almost guarantee that there&#39;s

05:01:12.160 --> 05:01:14.839
Caption: architecture diagrams like this out in

05:01:13.679 --> 05:01:17.679
Caption: the wild

05:01:14.839 --> 05:01:20.080
Caption: um so all we can

05:01:17.679 --> 05:01:22.400
Caption: all we can really tell from this with

05:01:20.080 --> 05:01:24.718
Caption: any great certainty is that

05:01:22.400 --> 05:01:26.240
Caption: when we get sample results back we would

05:01:24.718 --> 05:01:27.681
Caption: do something with those sample results

05:01:26.240 --> 05:01:29.279
Caption: right we could see

05:01:27.679 --> 05:01:31.359
Caption: those uh

05:01:29.279 --> 05:01:33.599
Caption: those data flow labels the sample pass

05:01:31.359 --> 05:01:35.039
Caption: and sample failed that&#39;s the only real

05:01:33.599 --> 05:01:36.716
Caption: certainty we can get out of this

05:01:35.039 --> 05:01:39.599
Caption: architecture diagram

05:01:36.718 --> 05:01:41.281
Caption: um so let&#39;s iterate

05:01:39.599 --> 05:01:43.599
Caption: so now we have a production line we can

05:01:41.279 --> 05:01:45.039
Caption: see what&#39;s actually happening here from

05:01:43.599 --> 05:01:46.876
Caption: the production line there&#39;s there&#39;s

05:01:45.039 --> 05:01:49.679
Caption: two-way data flow between

05:01:46.878 --> 05:01:52.560
Caption: the random sample sensor uh which has a

05:01:49.679 --> 05:01:54.876
Caption: better name now by the way it&#39;s not just

05:01:52.560 --> 05:01:58.240
Caption: a sensor it&#39;s a random sample sensor

05:01:54.878 --> 05:02:01.521
Caption: we&#39;ve got really descriptive

05:01:58.240 --> 05:02:03.041
Caption: labels associated with these things

05:02:01.519 --> 05:02:04.636
Caption: the random sample sensor we still don&#39;t

05:02:03.039 --> 05:02:07.359
Caption: know what it&#39;s doing it&#39;s just passing

05:02:04.638 --> 05:02:09.121
Caption: something into a black box sampling

05:02:07.359 --> 05:02:11.599
Caption: engine we still don&#39;t know what that

05:02:09.119 --> 05:02:13.599
Caption: sampling engine does

05:02:11.599 --> 05:02:15.919
Caption: we can see when it passes we actually go

05:02:13.599 --> 05:02:17.519
Caption: and restart the or restart or continue

05:02:15.919 --> 05:02:19.599
Caption: the production line we

05:02:17.519 --> 05:02:20.636
Caption: that label might need some work

05:02:19.599 --> 05:02:23.039
Caption: um

05:02:20.638 --> 05:02:24.958
Caption: and we can see the manager at some point

05:02:23.039 --> 05:02:26.957
Caption: presses the start button but we don&#39;t

05:02:24.957 --> 05:02:28.318
Caption: really know when that is

05:02:26.957 --> 05:02:30.636
Caption: so

05:02:28.320 --> 05:02:32.080
Caption: arguably better maybe worse

05:02:30.638 --> 05:02:33.601
Caption: um

05:02:32.080 --> 05:02:35.919
Caption: hopefully it illustrates a point though

05:02:33.599 --> 05:02:38.636
Caption: so now we can see that

05:02:35.919 --> 05:02:40.876
Caption: we&#39;ve got something generating a sample

05:02:38.638 --> 05:02:43.361
Caption: event we we know a bit more about what&#39;s

05:02:40.878 --> 05:02:45.281
Caption: happening in this system from from this

05:02:43.359 --> 05:02:46.558
Caption: um there&#39;s probably a few other bullet

05:02:45.279 --> 05:02:48.080
Caption: points we could include there we know

05:02:46.560 --> 05:02:50.798
Caption: that it&#39;s running against a production

05:02:48.080 --> 05:02:54.400
Caption: line we know that it&#39;s a manager that

05:02:50.798 --> 05:02:56.240
Caption: takes action on this system um

05:02:54.400 --> 05:02:59.679
Caption: overall we&#39;re starting to get a better

05:02:56.240 --> 05:03:01.919
Caption: picture of what this whole system does

05:02:59.679 --> 05:03:03.119
Caption: but we can do better so

05:03:01.919 --> 05:03:03.919
Caption: let&#39;s try

05:03:03.119 --> 05:03:06.636
Caption: um

05:03:03.919 --> 05:03:08.480
Caption: so now we have a lot a lot more going on

05:03:06.638 --> 05:03:10.320
Caption: here i try to run through it really

05:03:08.480 --> 05:03:12.878
Caption: quickly for you

05:03:10.320 --> 05:03:15.121
Caption: of keynote is we no longer have that

05:03:12.878 --> 05:03:17.601
Caption: black box sampling engine right we have

05:03:15.119 --> 05:03:20.478
Caption: individual components we have an sqs

05:03:17.599 --> 05:03:22.716
Caption: queue we have a lambda that takes the

05:03:20.480 --> 05:03:23.919
Caption: sample and does something with it we

05:03:22.718 --> 05:03:26.958
Caption: have a

05:03:23.919 --> 05:03:29.279
Caption: uh we can see that the sample goes and

05:03:26.957 --> 05:03:31.759
Caption: goes through some sort of analyzing

05:03:29.279 --> 05:03:33.519
Caption: system um

05:03:31.759 --> 05:03:35.279
Caption: don&#39;t know what i&#39;m not a cannery

05:03:33.519 --> 05:03:37.679
Caption: manager so don&#39;t ask me

05:03:35.279 --> 05:03:40.240
Caption: uh and then it gets processed by another

05:03:37.679 --> 05:03:42.160
Caption: lambda so we know instead of that single

05:03:40.240 --> 05:03:43.201
Caption: black box that we thought we had we

05:03:42.160 --> 05:03:45.439
Caption: actually have

05:03:43.199 --> 05:03:46.558
Caption: three arguably four different components

05:03:45.439 --> 05:03:48.478
Caption: there which is

05:03:46.560 --> 05:03:51.361
Caption: massive amounts more information that we

05:03:48.480 --> 05:03:53.679
Caption: can convey to our our users our

05:03:51.359 --> 05:03:56.398
Caption: stakeholders anyone who&#39;s interested in

05:03:53.679 --> 05:03:58.636
Caption: this system brand new devs that join the

05:03:56.400 --> 05:04:02.160
Caption: team you can go oh yeah cool we work

05:03:58.638 --> 05:04:04.560
Caption: with you know two lambdas and an sqsq

05:04:02.160 --> 05:04:06.560
Caption: instead of just there&#39;s this black box

05:04:04.560 --> 05:04:07.361
Caption: and you&#39;ll eventually figure out what it

05:04:06.560 --> 05:04:09.919
Caption: does

05:04:07.359 --> 05:04:12.000
Caption: there&#39;s tons more information here uh we

05:04:09.919 --> 05:04:14.320
Caption: can see when it fails we actually send a

05:04:12.000 --> 05:04:16.798
Caption: notification to the manager it just it

05:04:14.320 --> 05:04:18.638
Caption: doesn&#39;t just nebulously somehow get to

05:04:16.798 --> 05:04:20.958
Caption: the manager

05:04:18.638 --> 05:04:23.041
Caption: who then analyzes the results and

05:04:20.957 --> 05:04:25.279
Caption: there&#39;s some subjectivity here clearly

05:04:23.039 --> 05:04:27.679
Caption: because otherwise we wouldn&#39;t need to

05:04:25.279 --> 05:04:30.080
Caption: analyze the results the manager probably

05:04:27.679 --> 05:04:31.759
Caption: wouldn&#39;t even need to be involved

05:04:30.080 --> 05:04:33.439
Caption: and then you can see that

05:04:31.759 --> 05:04:35.119
Caption: based on analyzing the results they&#39;ll

05:04:33.439 --> 05:04:36.558
Caption: restart the production line perhaps

05:04:35.119 --> 05:04:38.158
Caption: there&#39;s other steps they have to take

05:04:36.560 --> 05:04:40.798
Caption: before they can do that i would assume

05:04:38.160 --> 05:04:42.560
Caption: they have to remove the crappy product

05:04:40.798 --> 05:04:45.041
Caption: before they restart it

05:04:42.560 --> 05:04:47.441
Caption: again i don&#39;t actually know how

05:04:45.039 --> 05:04:49.119
Caption: canneries work um

05:04:47.439 --> 05:04:50.080
Caption: but that&#39;s the basic premise right we

05:04:49.119 --> 05:04:52.238
Caption: want to

05:04:50.080 --> 05:04:54.320
Caption: we want to convey exactly what&#39;s

05:04:52.240 --> 05:04:56.400
Caption: happening in this system

05:04:54.320 --> 05:04:58.718
Caption: uh clear labels

05:04:56.400 --> 05:05:00.718
Caption: for everything your components it&#39;s not

05:04:58.718 --> 05:05:03.281
Caption: just a lambda it&#39;s a lambda that takes a

05:05:00.718 --> 05:05:05.361
Caption: sample it&#39;s a lambda that processes

05:05:03.279 --> 05:05:09.439
Caption: sample results it&#39;s very clear what

05:05:05.359 --> 05:05:09.439
Caption: those individual components are doing

05:05:10.480 --> 05:05:14.080
Caption: and that then helps you to convey

05:05:12.080 --> 05:05:15.599
Caption: meaning to the rest of the people

05:05:14.080 --> 05:05:17.519
Caption: involved in the project

05:05:15.599 --> 05:05:19.199
Caption: so uh

05:05:17.519 --> 05:05:21.679
Caption: this is a real world example this is

05:05:19.199 --> 05:05:24.478
Caption: something that i used um

05:05:21.679 --> 05:05:25.759
Caption: at a at a client this is actually part

05:05:24.480 --> 05:05:27.839
Caption: of a smaller

05:05:25.759 --> 05:05:29.839
Caption: bit of a smaller part of a larger

05:05:27.839 --> 05:05:32.320
Caption: architecture so this is

05:05:29.839 --> 05:05:35.759
Caption: one component out of

05:05:32.320 --> 05:05:38.240
Caption: four six there was multiple vpcs peering

05:05:35.759 --> 05:05:38.240
Caption: going on

05:05:38.320 --> 05:05:42.718
Caption: and it was all illustrated in the

05:05:39.759 --> 05:05:44.160
Caption: diagram where i i used a little pipe

05:05:42.718 --> 05:05:46.878
Caption: symbol to indicate that there was

05:05:44.160 --> 05:05:49.439
Caption: peering between the various vpcs

05:05:46.878 --> 05:05:51.201
Caption: um you know use your imagination here

05:05:49.439 --> 05:05:53.919
Caption: use some descript some something

05:05:51.199 --> 05:05:56.478
Caption: descriptive that&#39;s not just a box and an

05:05:53.919 --> 05:05:58.000
Caption: arrow to get your point across

05:05:56.480 --> 05:06:00.560
Caption: in this particular case we&#39;re talking

05:05:58.000 --> 05:06:02.798
Caption: about a step function you can see we&#39;re

05:06:00.560 --> 05:06:04.560
Caption: using the diamonds to indicate decision

05:06:02.798 --> 05:06:06.000
Caption: points in the process

05:06:04.560 --> 05:06:08.000
Caption: the

05:06:06.000 --> 05:06:10.480
Caption: gray box i&#39;m hoping it&#39;s grey it&#39;s grey

05:06:08.000 --> 05:06:13.119
Caption: on my screen a bit in the middle there

05:06:10.480 --> 05:06:14.240
Caption: with the map states is actually a

05:06:13.119 --> 05:06:16.398
Caption: parallel

05:06:14.240 --> 05:06:18.160
Caption: state where

05:06:16.400 --> 05:06:21.599
Caption: it takes multiple results and spins up

05:06:18.160 --> 05:06:23.759
Caption: multiple lambdas concurrently

05:06:21.599 --> 05:06:25.439
Caption: not sure that&#39;s the best representation

05:06:23.759 --> 05:06:27.199
Caption: but at least it gets the point across

05:06:25.439 --> 05:06:28.796
Caption: that something different is happening at

05:06:27.199 --> 05:06:30.957
Caption: that particular part of the process

05:06:28.798 --> 05:06:33.361
Caption: which is the goal here is we want to

05:06:30.957 --> 05:06:34.957
Caption: communicate exactly what&#39;s happening and

05:06:33.359 --> 05:06:36.320
Caption: you can start a discussion around that

05:06:34.957 --> 05:06:38.558
Caption: point you can go hey

05:06:36.320 --> 05:06:40.560
Caption: product owner we&#39;re actually spinning up

05:06:38.560 --> 05:06:42.400
Caption: 20 lambdas here right this is very

05:06:40.560 --> 05:06:43.919
Caption: different to just spinning up one lambda

05:06:42.400 --> 05:06:46.480
Caption: they&#39;re all processing things

05:06:43.919 --> 05:06:49.839
Caption: concurrently and we have to take certain

05:06:46.480 --> 05:06:52.000
Caption: actions as a result

05:06:49.839 --> 05:06:54.957
Caption: down the bottom you&#39;ve got external

05:06:52.000 --> 05:06:56.718
Caption: integrations with mulesoft that&#39;s as far

05:06:54.957 --> 05:06:58.478
Caption: as i went with this particular diagram

05:06:56.718 --> 05:07:01.121
Caption: you could go further the mulesoft

05:06:58.480 --> 05:07:04.240
Caption: actually pointed it at sap whether that

05:07:01.119 --> 05:07:06.957
Caption: adds value or not is is up to you

05:07:04.240 --> 05:07:08.878
Caption: the one thing this doesn&#39;t include is

05:07:06.957 --> 05:07:10.876
Caption: people uh

05:07:08.878 --> 05:07:12.638
Caption: that said this system doesn&#39;t actually

05:07:10.878 --> 05:07:14.878
Caption: really have people in the process it&#39;s a

05:07:12.638 --> 05:07:16.560
Caption: fully automated system so perhaps not

05:07:14.878 --> 05:07:17.441
Caption: the best example but i thought it would

05:07:16.560 --> 05:07:20.400
Caption: be

05:07:17.439 --> 05:07:23.199
Caption: interesting to a clue include a more

05:07:20.400 --> 05:07:24.000
Caption: beefier example of what i&#39;m

05:07:23.199 --> 05:07:25.519
Caption: um

05:07:24.000 --> 05:07:27.599
Caption: trying to

05:07:25.519 --> 05:07:28.636
Caption: get across here

05:07:27.599 --> 05:07:32.560
Caption: uh

05:07:28.638 --> 05:07:34.638
Caption: cool i&#39;m going really quick of course

05:07:32.560 --> 05:07:36.878
Caption: so look you see really quick that&#39;s

05:07:34.638 --> 05:07:37.681
Caption: that&#39;s basically the end of my talk so

05:07:36.878 --> 05:07:39.921
Caption: um

05:07:37.679 --> 05:07:42.080
Caption: the key takeaways here are

05:07:39.919 --> 05:07:44.240
Caption: build build architecture design

05:07:42.080 --> 05:07:46.240
Caption: architecture that includes everyone

05:07:44.240 --> 05:07:47.839
Caption: don&#39;t build these little black boxes

05:07:46.240 --> 05:07:51.279
Caption: that only the technical experts

05:07:47.839 --> 05:07:53.039
Caption: understand you lose so much value your

05:07:51.279 --> 05:07:54.957
Caption: your pos they don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on

05:07:53.039 --> 05:07:56.796
Caption: with these little black boxes you tell

05:07:54.957 --> 05:07:59.279
Caption: them there&#39;s a lambda that&#39;s doing

05:07:56.798 --> 05:08:00.798
Caption: something instantly they go oh cool i

05:07:59.279 --> 05:08:02.636
Caption: actually understand what that is you

05:08:00.798 --> 05:08:05.121
Caption: might have to explain them how a lamb

05:08:02.638 --> 05:08:06.400
Caption: explain to them how a lambda works but

05:08:05.119 --> 05:08:07.679
Caption: they&#39;re going to feel more connected to

05:08:06.400 --> 05:08:09.839
Caption: the project they&#39;re going to be more

05:08:07.679 --> 05:08:13.199
Caption: interested in what&#39;s happening i&#39;ve seen

05:08:09.839 --> 05:08:15.919
Caption: it time and time again the good pos even

05:08:13.199 --> 05:08:17.679
Caption: the mediocre pos they are way more

05:08:15.919 --> 05:08:18.718
Caption: involved in the process

05:08:17.679 --> 05:08:21.439
Caption: if you

05:08:18.718 --> 05:08:22.560
Caption: encourage them and include them in the

05:08:21.439 --> 05:08:24.000
Caption: whole thing

05:08:22.560 --> 05:08:25.361
Caption: they want to be involved in this at the

05:08:24.000 --> 05:08:27.279
Caption: end of the day that&#39;s their product

05:08:25.359 --> 05:08:29.359
Caption: right they they want to know what&#39;s

05:08:27.279 --> 05:08:31.199
Caption: happening with their product they are

05:08:29.359 --> 05:08:33.199
Caption: the owners so

05:08:31.199 --> 05:08:35.759
Caption: really encourage them

05:08:33.199 --> 05:08:38.398
Caption: to to get involved in this process and

05:08:35.759 --> 05:08:42.480
Caption: build a process build a build a diagram

05:08:38.400 --> 05:08:43.919
Caption: that does encourage them to do so

05:08:42.480 --> 05:08:46.000
Caption: things that will help you do this single

05:08:43.919 --> 05:08:49.039
Caption: responsibility principle right

05:08:46.000 --> 05:08:51.839
Caption: that single black box was split into two

05:08:49.039 --> 05:08:53.679
Caption: lambdas and a q and they all did one

05:08:51.839 --> 05:08:56.400
Caption: thing there was a lambda that took a

05:08:53.679 --> 05:08:58.400
Caption: sample um i don&#39;t know how that works on

05:08:56.400 --> 05:09:00.560
Caption: a cannery factory maybe they

05:08:58.400 --> 05:09:02.480
Caption: activate a different conveyor belt

05:09:00.560 --> 05:09:04.958
Caption: who knows but it that&#39;s all it does it

05:09:02.480 --> 05:09:07.281
Caption: just takes a sample when it responds to

05:09:04.957 --> 05:09:09.439
Caption: that random sampling event and then the

05:09:07.279 --> 05:09:11.519
Caption: other lambda that processes the results

05:09:09.439 --> 05:09:13.199
Caption: and says it&#39;s a pass or a fail right

05:09:11.519 --> 05:09:15.519
Caption: that&#39;s all it does it figures out

05:09:13.199 --> 05:09:18.238
Caption: whether the results are a pass or a fail

05:09:15.519 --> 05:09:20.000
Caption: it is very simple architecture it&#39;s easy

05:09:18.240 --> 05:09:21.759
Caption: to understand

05:09:20.000 --> 05:09:23.199
Caption: and everybody can understand it which is

05:09:21.759 --> 05:09:26.240
Caption: the whole point we want people to

05:09:23.199 --> 05:09:28.478
Caption: understand we want people to go oh can i

05:09:26.240 --> 05:09:31.599
Caption: add this particular component what&#39;s the

05:09:28.480 --> 05:09:33.919
Caption: impact of this particular feature or

05:09:31.599 --> 05:09:35.919
Caption: change to the system and if they

05:09:33.919 --> 05:09:37.599
Caption: understand the whole system they&#39;re

05:09:35.919 --> 05:09:39.439
Caption: going to be able to have more of a

05:09:37.599 --> 05:09:41.679
Caption: meaningful discussion with you about

05:09:39.439 --> 05:09:43.279
Caption: that

05:09:41.679 --> 05:09:46.080
Caption: readability and discoverability i

05:09:43.279 --> 05:09:48.796
Caption: mentioned earlier in the talk new devs

05:09:46.080 --> 05:09:49.839
Caption: new devs are going to understand

05:09:48.798 --> 05:09:52.400
Caption: this

05:09:49.839 --> 05:09:55.119
Caption: a lot quicker than if i just did that

05:09:52.400 --> 05:09:56.160
Caption: black box outside or maybe the

05:09:55.119 --> 05:09:58.398
Caption: the

05:09:56.160 --> 05:10:00.798
Caption: event bridge and the step function right

05:09:58.400 --> 05:10:03.839
Caption: having all the individual components is

05:10:00.798 --> 05:10:05.201
Caption: going to be way easier to understand and

05:10:03.839 --> 05:10:06.240
Caption: get them up to speed and that&#39;s what we

05:10:05.199 --> 05:10:08.318
Caption: want right we don&#39;t want to have to

05:10:06.240 --> 05:10:10.080
Caption: spend a month teaching the new dev all

05:10:08.320 --> 05:10:11.839
Caption: the different parts of the system we&#39;re

05:10:10.080 --> 05:10:14.400
Caption: going to go hey we need to make this

05:10:11.839 --> 05:10:16.718
Caption: change to lambda xyz go make that change

05:10:14.400 --> 05:10:19.201
Caption: and they can go do it without any

05:10:16.718 --> 05:10:21.441
Caption: other involvement so

05:10:19.199 --> 05:10:23.279
Caption: it&#39;s a really great way of onboarding

05:10:21.439 --> 05:10:24.876
Caption: people quick and everyone getting up to

05:10:23.279 --> 05:10:27.359
Caption: speed and everyone understanding the

05:10:24.878 --> 05:10:27.361
Caption: system

05:10:27.599 --> 05:10:30.320
Caption: and the last thing i&#39;ve kind of already

05:10:29.039 --> 05:10:32.238
Caption: touched on these opportunities to

05:10:30.320 --> 05:10:33.519
Caption: enhance your workflow right you&#39;re not

05:10:32.240 --> 05:10:34.958
Caption: always going to see everything just

05:10:33.519 --> 05:10:36.876
Caption: because you&#39;re the architect doesn&#39;t

05:10:34.957 --> 05:10:39.279
Caption: mean you always know best just because

05:10:36.878 --> 05:10:40.878
Caption: you&#39;re the senior dev or the tech lead

05:10:39.279 --> 05:10:41.919
Caption: just because you&#39;re the po doesn&#39;t mean

05:10:40.878 --> 05:10:44.480
Caption: you know

05:10:41.919 --> 05:10:47.439
Caption: the best workflow here by having an

05:10:44.480 --> 05:10:49.441
Caption: architecture that everybody understands

05:10:47.439 --> 05:10:51.039
Caption: you can all work together and spot

05:10:49.439 --> 05:10:52.876
Caption: opportunities to

05:10:51.039 --> 05:10:55.759
Caption: improve the workflow to enhance the

05:10:52.878 --> 05:10:59.041
Caption: workflow to add new business cases and

05:10:55.759 --> 05:10:59.039
Caption: value to that workflow

05:10:59.199 --> 05:11:03.039
Caption: and that&#39;s it that&#39;s me so

05:11:01.599 --> 05:11:04.636
Caption: thank you very much for coming to my

05:11:03.039 --> 05:11:05.779
Caption: talk and

05:11:04.638 --> 05:11:13.181
Caption: question time

05:11:05.779 --> 05:11:13.179
Caption: [Applause]

05:11:14.878 --> 05:11:19.361
Caption: thank you very much trent so it&#39;s not

05:11:17.119 --> 05:11:20.876
Caption: only about making inclusive software for

05:11:19.359 --> 05:11:23.759
Caption: your customers it&#39;s about making

05:11:20.878 --> 05:11:25.441
Caption: inclusive systems so you can basically

05:11:23.759 --> 05:11:27.199
Caption: communicate better with the team people

05:11:25.439 --> 05:11:29.679
Caption: that you&#39;re working with all the way

05:11:27.199 --> 05:11:31.199
Caption: through from exec to

05:11:29.679 --> 05:11:32.796
Caption: junior developer

05:11:31.199 --> 05:11:34.957
Caption: very good thank you now we&#39;re going to

05:11:32.798 --> 05:11:37.841
Caption: open the floor up for some q a&#39;s has

05:11:34.957 --> 05:11:37.839
Caption: anyone got a question

05:11:38.400 --> 05:11:41.121
Caption: just up the front

05:11:45.039 --> 05:11:51.679
Caption: possibly a a loaded question um have you

05:11:49.039 --> 05:11:55.039
Caption: have you heard of the uh c4 model of uh

05:11:51.679 --> 05:11:57.759
Caption: architecture diagrams recently yes yes

05:11:55.039 --> 05:12:00.796
Caption: yeah very similar i i considered adding

05:11:57.759 --> 05:12:03.199
Caption: that to this talk and you could uh if we

05:12:00.798 --> 05:12:05.121
Caption: look at uh say this particular model you

05:12:03.199 --> 05:12:06.957
Caption: could you could probably apply that here

05:12:05.119 --> 05:12:09.599
Caption: and say the um you know the two big

05:12:06.957 --> 05:12:11.519
Caption: black boxes are one level of the c4 and

05:12:09.599 --> 05:12:12.636
Caption: then you drill down another level and

05:12:11.519 --> 05:12:14.796
Caption: you get a

05:12:12.638 --> 05:12:16.240
Caption: view of the uh event bridge and the step

05:12:14.798 --> 05:12:18.080
Caption: function and the database and then

05:12:16.240 --> 05:12:19.519
Caption: another level and you get the internals

05:12:18.080 --> 05:12:21.119
Caption: of the step function and that would

05:12:19.519 --> 05:12:22.240
Caption: apply there um

05:12:21.119 --> 05:12:23.599
Caption: but

05:12:22.240 --> 05:12:26.080
Caption: yeah uh

05:12:23.599 --> 05:12:27.599
Caption: organically came to the same conclusions

05:12:26.080 --> 05:12:29.279
Caption: apparently i only discovered it in the

05:12:27.599 --> 05:12:30.716
Caption: last couple of months you&#39;ve reinvented

05:12:29.279 --> 05:12:32.160
Caption: it

05:12:30.718 --> 05:12:34.240
Caption: we discovered it ourselves about a year

05:12:32.160 --> 05:12:37.041
Caption: ago oh nice yeah how&#39;s it working for

05:12:34.240 --> 05:12:38.958
Caption: you that&#39;s brilliant yeah nice excellent

05:12:37.039 --> 05:12:42.158
Caption: yeah it basically what you showed there

05:12:38.957 --> 05:12:44.158
Caption: it really opens up the magic black box

05:12:42.160 --> 05:12:45.759
Caption: yeah um

05:12:44.160 --> 05:12:48.080
Caption: and uh yeah more people can understand

05:12:45.759 --> 05:12:49.519
Caption: the system and once you do that more

05:12:48.080 --> 05:12:51.519
Caption: people go hang on actually that&#39;s a bit

05:12:49.519 --> 05:12:53.599
Caption: crap yeah

05:12:51.519 --> 05:12:55.199
Caption: yeah it leads to an improved system

05:12:53.599 --> 05:12:58.400
Caption: though when they say that right so yeah

05:12:55.199 --> 05:12:58.398
Caption: it&#39;s good cool thank you

05:12:58.718 --> 05:13:01.919
Caption: any more questions any more questions

05:13:04.160 --> 05:13:08.400
Caption: um have you got any advice for people

05:13:06.320 --> 05:13:10.080
Caption: who are reviewing someone else&#39;s

05:13:08.400 --> 05:13:11.599
Caption: architecture diagram any sort of red

05:13:10.080 --> 05:13:12.480
Caption: flags to look out for and that sort of

05:13:11.599 --> 05:13:14.849
Caption: thing

05:13:12.480 --> 05:13:16.878
Caption: oh yeah that&#39;s a good one no boxes

05:13:14.849 --> 05:13:17.839
Caption: [Laughter]

05:13:16.878 --> 05:13:19.281
Caption: um

05:13:17.839 --> 05:13:21.519
Caption: yeah look i

05:13:19.279 --> 05:13:21.519
Caption: uh

05:13:21.599 --> 05:13:26.400
Caption: i can&#39;t think of anything off the top

05:13:23.199 --> 05:13:29.599
Caption: i&#39;ve not done a lot of reviews right i

05:13:26.400 --> 05:13:31.759
Caption: um i tend to either pick something up

05:13:29.599 --> 05:13:33.439
Caption: and

05:13:31.759 --> 05:13:35.519
Caption: try and figure out what&#39;s going on or

05:13:33.439 --> 05:13:37.519
Caption: i&#39;ll be building the diagram myself i

05:13:35.519 --> 05:13:41.199
Caption: guess the only thing i would

05:13:37.519 --> 05:13:43.199
Caption: perhaps consider when doing a review is

05:13:41.199 --> 05:13:44.876
Caption: maybe build it yourself do the diagram

05:13:43.199 --> 05:13:46.398
Caption: yourself and see what the differences
