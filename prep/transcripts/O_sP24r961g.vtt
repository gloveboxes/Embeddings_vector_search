00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:08.289
Caption: all right good evening and thanks for

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.729
Caption: having me here in Perth I lived in a

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.819
Caption: place called Brisbane out of the other

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:15.010
Caption: side of the desert and hoping to Perth

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:20.018
Caption: for a couple of years great place so

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.919
Caption: thanks again I&#39;m going to tell you my

00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:23.559
Caption: goal tonight is to tell you what

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.509
Caption: functional programming means just what

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:27.159
Caption: it means

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.529
Caption: mostly because I am sympathetic to you

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:32.200
Caption: if you typed into a search engine right

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:35.439
Caption: now what does it mean you&#39;ll get ten

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.450
Caption: wrong answers well unfortunately it&#39;s

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:41.889
Caption: it&#39;s it still has a bit of mysticism

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.779
Caption: around it and my one of my main goals of

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:45.459
Caption: coming here to Perth is to you know

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:48.040
Caption: spend three days with people who would

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:50.229
Caption: like to learn it in depth so I think

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.220
Caption: some of you are in this room we did our

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:55.439
Caption: mana edge tutorial today one adds a they

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.900
Caption: have a reputation for being difficult

00:00:55.439 --> 00:01:03.039
Caption: they&#39;re not right wherever you are it&#39;s

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.409
Caption: just so that you don&#39;t write the same

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.009
Caption: code over and over again so that&#39;s done

00:01:05.408 --> 00:01:11.169
Caption: and we&#39;ll go back to relaxing tomorrow

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.990
Caption: okay so I work for the Queensland

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:16.419
Caption: functional programming lab I am

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:19.779
Caption: it&#39;s a CSIRO and Queensland government

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:22.809
Caption: initiative and just to briefly say what

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:24.849
Caption: it is that I do I try to help Australian

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:26.459
Caption: software developers take advantage of

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:29.258
Caption: the benefits of functional programming

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:32.138
Caption: that&#39;s what I do and there&#39;s a team of

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.869
Caption: six of us I&#39;m soon to be eleven I&#39;m

00:01:32.138 --> 00:01:37.059
Caption: hiring if you&#39;d like to cross the desert

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.880
Caption: and come and write Haskell with me send

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:43.809
Caption: me an email so that&#39;s pretty much what I

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:45.429
Caption: do and it&#39;s quite fun writing open

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:47.708
Caption: source code helping out government

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.969
Caption: departments we&#39;ve got all their data in

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:52.739
Caption: a mess and they&#39;re like help

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.740
Caption: oh yeah no worries I got Haskell

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:01.159
Caption: yes they we sort that out so I get this

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:02.000
Caption: I get this question quite a lot yeah so

00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:03.529
Caption: I don&#39;t know if you have this question

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.330
Caption: but if you do how do what can I be

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:07.279
Caption: notified about the upcoming courses sign

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.440
Caption: up to that mailing list whenever I&#39;m

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:10.699
Caption: going to Perth or Canberra or whatever

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.350
Caption: when we&#39;re going to do it that&#39;s I&#39;ll

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:17.479
Caption: write an email there and sometimes I get

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.790
Caption: this question like so these three days

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:21.349
Caption: I&#39;m like I&#39;m burning people really hard

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:24.348
Caption: right am i right

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.569
Caption: yeah I&#39;m right I&#39;m like I&#39;m drilling you

00:02:24.348 --> 00:02:28.488
Caption: hard but we&#39;re gonna get to the end of

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.279
Caption: it and you&#39;re gonna say to me how do I

00:02:28.488 --> 00:02:35.089
Caption: write a web app in Haskell right or

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:36.440
Caption: something like this so that&#39;s that

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:37.639
Caption: that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing that now

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.410
Caption: so if you&#39;re interested in that so

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.759
Caption: you&#39;ve been burnt you&#39;ve learned all the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.059
Caption: introductory stuff you&#39;re ready to go

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:47.149
Caption: how do I write a database where that

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.988
Caption: whatever it is you want to do so we&#39;re

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:53.929
Caption: doing that this year

00:02:47.988 --> 00:02:57.979
Caption: and yes I do yes we do six of us let

00:02:53.929 --> 00:03:00.319
Caption: alone it so I&#39;ve just a background on

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:03.500
Caption: how I got into functional programming I

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.970
Caption: used to work for IBM and I asked these

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.488
Caption: days to implement is language called

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.009
Caption: Java if you ever heard of it

00:03:07.488 --> 00:03:12.380
Caption: basically you got to write a compiler

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:16.429
Caption: and it compiles your code that was my

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:20.029
Caption: job and there was a company called Sun

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:22.419
Caption: Microsystems back then so I had to

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:24.949
Caption: implement this thing called Java I

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.899
Caption: learnt it as much as I needed to so that

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:30.470
Caption: I could write all the Camellia compiler

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:32.449
Caption: and specifications and so on and it was

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.820
Caption: it was a simple thought that I assume

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.738
Caption: everyone has had every programmer at

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.250
Caption: least has had which is simply surely

00:03:36.738 --> 00:03:41.690
Caption: there&#39;s a better way okay so you know

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.458
Caption: Java programmers in the room you&#39;ve all

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.930
Caption: seen like null pointer exceptions and

00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:46.910
Caption: you&#39;ve seen all this stuff and you&#39;re

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:52.369
Caption: like do I really have to meet you with

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.079
Caption: this really and you need to develop a

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:56.509
Caption: process to answer this question and my

00:03:54.078 --> 00:03:58.369
Caption: process was someone smarter than me has

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:03.319
Caption: figured this out

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:05.869
Caption: who are these smart people and the smart

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.208
Caption: people I found out where the functional

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:11.149
Caption: programmers they&#39;ve already figured this

00:04:08.208 --> 00:04:12.800
Caption: out they figured out how to not have

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:15.169
Caption: enough functional corner exceptions

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.029
Caption: right and so on they&#39;ve worked out how

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:21.820
Caption: to do it and I&#39;m gonna go and steal all

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:21.820
Caption: their ideas that&#39;s pretty much it so

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:28.699
Caption: when I when I first moved to Brisbane in

00:04:24.859 --> 00:04:31.728
Caption: like 2003 or four I think there were two

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:34.910
Caption: of us writing Haskell in Brisbane and we

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.459
Caption: found each other because I appeared in

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.410
Caption: the television interview and the other

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:40.609
Caption: person said hey that&#39;s the person off

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.550
Caption: the Haskell mailing list

00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:47.179
Caption: he lives in Brisbane there&#39;s two of us

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:47.809
Caption: and it kind of went from there that&#39;s a

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:51.410
Caption: true story

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:53.179
Caption: so functional programming is certainly

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.289
Caption: my opinion on how to do software

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:57.859
Caption: development so I&#39;m going to tell you

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:01.789
Caption: what it means what does it mean common

00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:03.859
Caption: question so I&#39;m going to show you a

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:08.899
Caption: computer program this is a this is in

00:05:03.859 --> 00:05:10.969
Caption: any syntax no particular language and if

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:14.419
Caption: we look at this this this procedure up

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.919
Caption: here and we notice first of all it adds

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.380
Caption: one to the counter some counter

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:21.260
Caption: somewhere and then it returns a plus B

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.830
Caption: times two and then the arbitrary code

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.419
Caption: stands for the rest of the application

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:28.638
Caption: all right fifty billion lines of

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:32.839
Caption: whatever it is and then you come across

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:35.020
Caption: this expression down here alright and

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:37.339
Caption: you look at this and you go okay

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:41.329
Caption: there&#39;s some code duplication right

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:44.750
Caption: there can i factor that code duplication

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:47.439
Caption: out without affecting the program can I

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.440
Caption: do that

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:57.948
Caption: did the program just change it did yeah

00:05:55.119 --> 00:06:00.949
Caption: it changed why did it change it changed

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.300
Caption: because the counter used to update twice

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:06.139
Caption: because there were two calls to the

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:08.539
Caption: wibble function or procedure and now

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:12.350
Caption: there&#39;s one so the counter only updates

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:16.100
Caption: once the program changed

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:19.820
Caption: I cannot take an expression factor it

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:23.839
Caption: out naively and get the same program in

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:29.679
Caption: this particular circumstance and it&#39;s

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:34.579
Caption: because of that so if I take that out

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:38.049
Caption: and look at this exact same program and

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:43.220
Caption: I say there&#39;s some code duplication

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:48.039
Caption: can i factor it out I can the program

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:51.579
Caption: didn&#39;t change that is the same program

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:51.579
Caption: isn&#39;t that great

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:02.059
Caption: it didn&#39;t change and that&#39;s because it

00:06:57.739 --> 00:07:04.609
Caption: is a function Whittle or pebble in this

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:06.320
Caption: case is a function there&#39;s a function

00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:13.479
Caption: because given the inputs it&#39;ll return

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:13.480
Caption: the same output and do nothing else okay

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:32.589
Caption: sure which one this one here yeah yeah

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:34.880
Caption: yeah well this is the original program

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:38.290
Caption: so the question I&#39;m asking is if I

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:41.660
Caption: change this program into that program

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:46.309
Caption: did it change from the previous one into

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:49.369
Caption: this one it does in this case yeah it

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:52.160
Caption: didn&#39;t in the other case you agree with

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:55.729
Caption: that do I have your agreement on these

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.100
Caption: things because if so because because it

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.690
Caption: is the same program or the reason it&#39;s

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.350
Caption: the same program is because people is a

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:10.279
Caption: function there is no additional effect

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:11.390
Caption: going on okay so the program didn&#39;t

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:13.489
Caption: change in the second circumstance

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.770
Caption: because there was a function and that&#39;s

00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:17.599
Caption: because given the same output inputs to

00:08:15.769 --> 00:08:22.220
Caption: get same outputs with no other changes

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:24.410
Caption: caring that is to say we can replace an

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.380
Caption: expression with its value naively and

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:30.410
Caption: always get the same program that is

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:32.619
Caption: functional programming Mike drops a

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.619
Caption: letter

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.590
Caption: I&#39;m dead set that is the definition of

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:39.000
Caption: functional programming the extent to

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.240
Caption: which I can replace expressions with

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.659
Caption: values without changing program behavior

00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:47.700
Caption: that&#39;s a very simple definition and that

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:49.529
Caption: the property of expressions when they

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.730
Caption: when you can do this with expressions is

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.430
Caption: sometimes called referential

00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:55.679
Caption: transparency so we&#39;d say that that

00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:57.630
Caption: expression back back earlier the pibil

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:59.940
Caption: one that is a referentially transparent

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.739
Caption: expression whereas the wibble one was

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:07.010
Caption: not i cannot substitute it with its

00:09:01.739 --> 00:09:09.929
Caption: value and get the same same outcome so

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:13.770
Caption: so what why does the government pay me

00:09:09.929 --> 00:09:17.010
Caption: to care a lot about that it&#39;s because of

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:19.650
Caption: the consequences so who users like you

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:22.109
Caption: know JavaScript and Java and Python and

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.640
Caption: c-sharp all these languages right you

00:09:22.109 --> 00:09:24.719
Caption: can be counter equals counter plus one

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.570
Caption: no worries and off you go

00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:33.539
Caption: I can&#39;t that&#39;s one of the consequences

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:34.950
Caption: straight away you can&#39;t do this right in

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:36.329
Caption: whatever language it is you use you&#39;ve

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:43.109
Caption: got an object with mutable fields in

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:47.549
Caption: there I can&#39;t do that right you can even

00:09:43.109 --> 00:09:52.769
Caption: do that I can&#39;t do that if I say I equal

00:09:47.549 --> 00:09:55.469
Caption: to 0 I will always equal 0 it&#39;s the end

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:58.440
Caption: of the argument if you come along and go

00:09:55.469 --> 00:10:00.719
Caption: I plus plus it will not compile Haskell

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.140
Caption: will not compile that so hang on a

00:10:00.719 --> 00:10:04.699
Caption: minute

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:07.700
Caption: I equals 0 ie plus plus

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.700
Caption: contradiction

00:10:07.849 --> 00:10:15.148
Caption: um I I have two children when my son was

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:18.599
Caption: nine years old I had the following

00:10:15.148 --> 00:10:21.239
Caption: discussion that went like this if C plus

00:10:18.599 --> 00:10:25.768
Caption: three equals seven what&#39;s C and he said

00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:29.159
Caption: what it&#39;s for oh yeah okay well if X

00:10:25.768 --> 00:10:32.880
Caption: times five equals 25 what&#39;s X he said

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:35.179
Caption: well it&#39;s five and I said if I equals

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.859
Caption: zero and then I equals I plus 1 what&#39;s I

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:45.869
Caption: you said that makes no sense

00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:50.338
Caption: I said correct I have it I have it on

00:10:45.869 --> 00:10:52.559
Caption: mp3 if you&#39;d like to listen to it I did

00:10:50.338 --> 00:10:55.398
Caption: not prod him at all that exists

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:58.979
Caption: one morning I just started saying that

00:10:55.398 --> 00:11:01.109
Caption: so you can&#39;t do that in because this

00:10:58.979 --> 00:11:02.609
Caption: expression here I plus plus is not

00:11:01.109 --> 00:11:04.469
Caption: referentially transparent you cannot

00:11:02.609 --> 00:11:06.599
Caption: substitute I throughout the program and

00:11:04.469 --> 00:11:10.049
Caption: get the same program they&#39;re all

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:11.849
Caption: different eyes you can&#39;t do this common

00:11:10.049 --> 00:11:15.388
Caption: question I get does that mean you can&#39;t

00:11:11.849 --> 00:11:18.268
Caption: do I oh well of course I can I just

00:11:15.388 --> 00:11:20.969
Caption: can&#39;t you know do it messily like this I

00:11:18.268 --> 00:11:22.648
Caption: can&#39;t just arbitrarily do it I can&#39;t

00:11:20.969 --> 00:11:24.419
Caption: just start doing these things right if I

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:27.028
Caption: if I replace read file with the filename

00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:29.659
Caption: with its value I&#39;d get a different

00:11:27.028 --> 00:11:33.179
Caption: program right it had read the file once

00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:34.440
Caption: and then that&#39;s it all right

00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:37.018
Caption: that would just it would change the

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.429
Caption: program outcome if I were to substitute

00:11:37.018 --> 00:11:43.708
Caption: that expression there read file file

00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:45.028
Caption: name with its value so if I live three

00:11:43.708 --> 00:11:46.828
Caption: days by the way that we&#39;re spending is

00:11:45.028 --> 00:11:48.929
Caption: I&#39;ve taken away all these tools from you

00:11:46.828 --> 00:11:50.909
Caption: know 30 people in the room who are so

00:11:48.929 --> 00:11:53.309
Caption: used to like read file write file I plus

00:11:50.909 --> 00:11:54.809
Caption: plus everything&#39;s just fine and I&#39;ve

00:11:53.309 --> 00:11:58.138
Caption: just taken all of that away from them

00:11:54.809 --> 00:11:59.880
Caption: and they&#39;re standing there naked like

00:11:58.138 --> 00:12:03.059
Caption: how do I solve all these problems now

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:08.010
Caption: and I substituting new problem solving

00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:11.458
Caption: tools and causes some pain but that&#39;s

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:12.570
Caption: okay it is okay right it&#39;s a little bit

00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:18.000
Caption: of pain

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:22.020
Caption: yeah not too much I&#39;ll give you an

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.400
Caption: example these are some of the questions

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:27.030
Caption: that we were immediately asked once I

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.740
Caption: take away all your where your tools will

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:33.030
Caption: we will be answering that third question

00:12:28.739 --> 00:12:34.649
Caption: tomorrow by the way how do we design our

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.700
Caption: data structures how do I can&#39;t have

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:39.869
Caption: mutable fields anymore

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:42.929
Caption: what do I do how do I write loops how do

00:12:39.869 --> 00:12:44.760
Caption: I even sum the values of a list alright

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:47.099
Caption: so if you&#39;ve never heard a functional

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:53.100
Caption: programming how do you sum the values in

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:58.139
Caption: a list how do you do it oh you&#39;ve heard

00:12:53.099 --> 00:13:01.259
Caption: a functional programming you go x equals

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:04.559
Caption: zero for each element in the list x

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:09.809
Caption: equals x plus the element return x am i

00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:12.619
Caption: right something like this if I remember

00:13:09.809 --> 00:13:16.289
Caption: rightly last time I wrote a for loop

00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:18.750
Caption: it&#39;s something like that so set the

00:13:16.289 --> 00:13:20.880
Caption: counter at zero or a start position a

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:23.729
Caption: zero go through the list for each

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.190
Caption: element add the counter to that element

00:13:23.729 --> 00:13:29.159
Caption: return the counter it&#39;s the sum of the

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:30.840
Caption: lists but there&#39;s a different way of

00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:32.489
Caption: thinking about this problem so this is

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.350
Caption: an example of I&#39;m going to take away

00:13:32.489 --> 00:13:36.419
Caption: this I&#39;ve taken away loops they don&#39;t

00:13:34.349 --> 00:13:38.039
Caption: exist and we&#39;re going to sum up the

00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:40.769
Caption: elements of the list and I did hear

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:41.459
Caption: someone say recursion and that&#39;s how

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.760
Caption: we&#39;re going to do it

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:47.010
Caption: so these things are disallowed okay if I

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:50.729
Caption: set R equal to zero what&#39;s our it&#39;s zero

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:54.929
Caption: end of argument so that this thing here

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:56.969
Caption: is not a thing if I set I equal to 0 its

00:13:54.929 --> 00:14:01.429
Caption: 0 that would be a very uninteresting

00:13:56.969 --> 00:14:01.429
Caption: program R equals 0 equals 0 at the end

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:06.299
Caption: so there&#39;s another way of looking at the

00:14:03.539 --> 00:14:09.809
Caption: problem of adding up the integers of a

00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:14.549
Caption: list and it it&#39;s this if the list is

00:14:09.809 --> 00:14:17.010
Caption: empty return zero but if it&#39;s not then

00:14:14.549 --> 00:14:20.940
Caption: return the first element plus the sum of

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:23.190
Caption: the rest of the list does everyone agree

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:28.950
Caption: that that adds up all the integers in a

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:30.599
Caption: list so basically we have a list and

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.239
Caption: Alyssa can be displayed into two

00:14:30.599 --> 00:14:34.799
Caption: possible cases is it empty or does it

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:37.859
Caption: have a first element and the rest of the

00:14:34.799 --> 00:14:39.028
Caption: list that&#39;s the definition of a list in

00:14:37.859 --> 00:14:40.440
Caption: Haskell in fact I could show you the

00:14:39.028 --> 00:14:42.539
Caption: code I don&#39;t have a pair Boca shades

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.708
Caption: just basically is empty or has the start

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:48.148
Caption: element and then the rest of the list

00:14:43.708 --> 00:14:50.039
Caption: that&#39;s the definition of the datatype so

00:14:48.148 --> 00:14:53.458
Caption: stepping through that that definition

00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:54.958
Caption: let&#39;s add up a list and we say well is

00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:57.838
Caption: that list six five nine seventy one

00:14:54.958 --> 00:15:00.109
Caption: three is it empty no well then the sum

00:14:57.838 --> 00:15:05.309
Caption: of it is six plus the sum of the rest

00:15:00.109 --> 00:15:07.349
Caption: and so on until we get down to the sum

00:15:05.309 --> 00:15:09.708
Caption: of the empty list and we say well is it

00:15:07.349 --> 00:15:12.028
Caption: empty yes and then we substitute to zero

00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:18.510
Caption: and then at and then the sum of all of

00:15:12.028 --> 00:15:20.609
Caption: that is 94 and at no time did I say I

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:23.600
Caption: equals zero oh wait no it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s I

00:15:20.609 --> 00:15:23.599
Caption: equals I plus one

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:34.340
Caption: there&#39;s the Haskell code who&#39;s not a

00:15:30.809 --> 00:15:38.729
Caption: programmer can you read that

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:40.080
Caption: just curious I&#39;ll explain it to you and

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:43.849
Caption: then you answer for me all right

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:47.100
Caption: so the sum of an empty list is equals 0

00:15:43.849 --> 00:15:48.479
Caption: the sum of a list that has the first

00:15:47.099 --> 00:15:51.779
Caption: element in the rest is the first element

00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:57.209
Caption: plus the sum of the rest I think that&#39;s

00:15:51.780 --> 00:16:01.980
Caption: pretty straightforward who&#39;s not a

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:06.510
Caption: programmer and can read that I struggle

00:16:01.979 --> 00:16:14.519
Caption: myself a zero oh wait no it&#39;s not hang

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:15.989
Caption: on that&#39;s how I read that k my common

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.020
Caption: criticism of functional programming is

00:16:15.989 --> 00:16:22.200
Caption: that it&#39;s unintuitive I&#39;m kind of

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:27.390
Caption: mocking that criticism lies my

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:29.160
Caption: nine-year-old disagrees so what say yeah

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:31.500
Caption: this is a good question

00:16:29.159 --> 00:16:33.750
Caption: much more serious question which is why

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.950
Caption: would I even care all right you might be

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.690
Caption: over there writing your loop see like

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:39.000
Caption: I&#39;m totally cool with loops I&#39;m summing

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:42.239
Caption: up the list everything&#39;s just fine leave

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.599
Caption: me alone all right what I&#39;m saying but

00:16:42.239 --> 00:16:49.289
Caption: there&#39;s practical benefits what are they

00:16:45.599 --> 00:16:50.729
Caption: and this is quite a deep question I&#39;m

00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:52.289
Caption: happy to answer it for days and days and

00:16:50.729 --> 00:16:53.820
Caption: days if you like but I don&#39;t have that

00:16:52.289 --> 00:16:59.000
Caption: much but I&#39;ll do my best in the short

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:59.000
Caption: amount of time so they&#39;re not obvious

00:16:59.088 --> 00:17:04.438
Caption: and it&#39;s like it&#39;s the people who are in

00:17:03.299 --> 00:17:06.179
Caption: this three-day course it&#39;s still not

00:17:04.438 --> 00:17:10.020
Caption: obvious I think so we&#39;re up to date it&#39;s

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:15.569
Caption: still not obvious but just to give it a

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:16.140
Caption: hand wavy overview right so and ender

00:17:15.568 --> 00:17:17.669
Caption: there&#39;s a penalty

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:20.130
Caption: the penalty is I&#39;ve taken away all your

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:22.439
Caption: familiar tools so you&#39;re trusting me

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.000
Caption: right now and I completely appreciate

00:17:22.438 --> 00:17:27.448
Caption: that I&#39;ve taken away all the good things

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.250
Caption: and I&#39;ve not yet given you any well I&#39;m

00:17:27.448 --> 00:17:31.520
Caption: not giving you anything good to

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:35.839
Caption: substitute them all back

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:38.719
Caption: but I can reason about programs okay

00:17:35.839 --> 00:17:41.029
Caption: so again this is a hand wave you think I

00:17:38.719 --> 00:17:44.959
Caption: could concrete this in if at the time

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:47.989
Caption: but basically looking at the definition

00:17:44.959 --> 00:17:50.719
Caption: of some in Haskell let&#39;s go back and

00:17:47.989 --> 00:17:53.660
Caption: have a look at that actually the Sun so

00:17:50.719 --> 00:17:56.150
Caption: for example if I look at this program I

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:58.640
Caption: can reason about for example that line

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:01.160
Caption: independently of that line there are two

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.660
Caption: discrete programs and they exist

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.760
Caption: independently and I&#39;ve just put them

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.200
Caption: together to make a new one not only that

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.119
Caption: to do this one

00:18:06.199 --> 00:18:10.069
Caption: I&#39;ve taken the plus function and that

00:18:08.119 --> 00:18:12.559
Caption: value and that function and made a new

00:18:10.069 --> 00:18:16.659
Caption: one and did the sum function delete the

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:19.040
Caption: database no it can&#39;t

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:21.220
Caption: now you might go well that&#39;s insane

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.650
Caption: some functions don&#39;t delete databases

00:18:21.219 --> 00:18:26.209
Caption: and I would say yes they do you&#39;ve

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.650
Caption: surely worked on this project where

00:18:26.209 --> 00:18:30.799
Caption: there&#39;s some function deleted the

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:32.690
Caption: database right anyone&#39;s been doing

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.510
Caption: programming long enough guys who put

00:18:32.689 --> 00:18:38.149
Caption: that there that&#39;s insane it updates to

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:40.820
Caption: fling and floppin whatever it is right

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:44.260
Caption: we know these programs they exist they

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:46.699
Caption: can&#39;t exist here they&#39;re discrete units

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.550
Caption: it&#39;s usually like not deleting the

00:18:46.699 --> 00:18:52.029
Caption: databases like inserting a database row

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:54.140
Caption: I&#39;ll wait now there&#39;s two of them whoops

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.270
Caption: something like this happens or updates

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:59.660
Caption: the XML configuration file whatever I

00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:01.250
Caption: don&#39;t Carn exist here these are discrete

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:06.440
Caption: units and I can exact and reason about

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:08.869
Caption: them independently not there I can&#39;t our

00:19:06.439 --> 00:19:11.059
Caption: equals zero oh wait no it doesn&#39;t and so

00:19:08.869 --> 00:19:11.479
Caption: on but I have to do the whole thing all

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.370
Caption: at once

00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:16.130
Caption: I can&#39;t reason about that discreetly the

00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:18.290
Caption: plus function I can and I mean plus

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:20.150
Caption: function I can because it&#39;s a function

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.390
Caption: the things that are not functions I

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.390
Caption: can&#39;t

00:19:22.788 --> 00:19:33.378
Caption: and say oops so the other one is

00:19:29.078 --> 00:19:37.158
Caption: composition so it&#39;s basically if I have

00:19:33.379 --> 00:19:39.198
Caption: discrete units of programs I can glue

00:19:37.159 --> 00:19:44.320
Caption: them together to make slightly less

00:19:39.198 --> 00:19:47.538
Caption: smaller units and I can keep going so

00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:49.488
Caption: and by that I mean that they&#39;re discrete

00:19:47.538 --> 00:19:51.108
Caption: I take another discrete unit blew it

00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:52.489
Caption: together I have another just another

00:19:51.109 --> 00:19:56.779
Caption: small unit and then I can take another

00:19:52.489 --> 00:19:59.838
Caption: one and so on as opposed to the monolith

00:19:56.779 --> 00:20:01.489
Caption: program so who&#39;s got a monolith program

00:19:59.838 --> 00:20:04.189
Caption: at work just by the way just come on

00:20:01.489 --> 00:20:06.289
Caption: let&#39;s be a bit honest so everyone&#39;s got

00:20:04.189 --> 00:20:11.238
Caption: one right there&#39;s the monolith program

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:12.798
Caption: expert on your team yeah you&#39;re like hey

00:20:11.239 --> 00:20:14.808
Caption: you know the project manager wants to

00:20:12.798 --> 00:20:16.908
Caption: add you add a widget in the corner and

00:20:14.808 --> 00:20:18.288
Caption: you go what happens when I go and

00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:20.449
Caption: twiddle the code this way and add the

00:20:18.288 --> 00:20:24.068
Caption: widget you go on ask the expert as well

00:20:20.448 --> 00:20:28.009
Caption: yeah it&#39;ll take six months whatever you

00:20:24.068 --> 00:20:29.718
Caption: know all that that&#39;s true

00:20:28.009 --> 00:20:32.239
Caption: yes it&#39;s like what you want to add a

00:20:29.718 --> 00:20:35.869
Caption: widget no way we can&#39;t do that all it&#39;ll

00:20:32.239 --> 00:20:40.519
Caption: be a rewrite yeah that&#39;s really what

00:20:35.869 --> 00:20:43.039
Caption: happens so that&#39;s because at least I&#39;m

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:45.049
Caption: going to I&#39;m trying to claim that the

00:20:43.038 --> 00:20:47.558
Caption: program is not in discrete units of

00:20:45.048 --> 00:20:50.028
Caption: composition it&#39;s just a model with a

00:20:47.558 --> 00:20:52.338
Caption: depends on B on C on D and back again

00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:55.339
Caption: around a and so on in the expert tries

00:20:52.338 --> 00:20:56.958
Caption: to hold rule in their head I&#39;ve never

00:20:55.338 --> 00:21:00.408
Caption: met an expert that actually can but they

00:20:56.958 --> 00:21:02.119
Caption: try and good on them but it&#39;s so

00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:03.619
Caption: difficult that you hit a scalability

00:21:02.119 --> 00:21:04.879
Caption: problem with your development and you

00:21:03.619 --> 00:21:06.759
Caption: just that&#39;s the size of your program

00:21:04.879 --> 00:21:11.539
Caption: forever and that&#39;s why they say no

00:21:06.759 --> 00:21:13.458
Caption: you&#39;re not adding the widget and and and

00:21:11.538 --> 00:21:16.628
Caption: I&#39;ll be honest I&#39;ve worked on one a list

00:21:13.458 --> 00:21:16.629
Caption: don&#39;t worry I&#39;ve written them myself

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:28.439
Caption: so it takes a lot of work okay those of

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:31.299
Caption: you are up to date ooh good on you

00:21:28.439 --> 00:21:35.199
Caption: all right I have set you on fire many

00:21:31.298 --> 00:21:38.769
Caption: times and I understand this and a little

00:21:35.199 --> 00:21:42.039
Caption: bit sorry but not a lot because there&#39;s

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:44.290
Caption: benefits all right so those you are not

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:49.359
Caption: not there you know I am hurting people a

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:51.700
Caption: lot we have completed that there&#39;s a

00:21:49.359 --> 00:21:53.979
Caption: there&#39;s a course called the CIS one line

00:21:51.699 --> 00:21:55.739
Caption: for undergraduate introduction to high

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:58.660
Caption: school at the University of Pennsylvania

00:21:55.739 --> 00:22:01.678
Caption: it&#39;s online you can go and do that right

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:05.049
Caption: now and we&#39;ve just done that in two days

00:22:01.678 --> 00:22:08.019
Caption: all right so that&#39;s that&#39;s how hard I&#39;m

00:22:05.048 --> 00:22:13.899
Caption: hurting people because it&#39;s a lot of

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:15.969
Caption: work so what I&#39;m getting at is is if you

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:19.059
Caption: were to ever commit to taking advantage

00:22:15.969 --> 00:22:20.739
Caption: of these things in your programming you

00:22:19.058 --> 00:22:25.178
Caption: would have to do a lot of work make no

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:27.250
Caption: mistake about it but I&#39;m committed to

00:22:25.178 --> 00:22:29.260
Caption: helping you that&#39;s what I want to do all

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:32.079
Caption: right so I will hold your hand when you

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:36.760
Caption: fall I&#39;ll pick you up and we&#39;ll keep

00:22:32.079 --> 00:22:38.409
Caption: going and through the trenches and we&#39;ll

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.469
Caption: get to the other end and you feel like

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:44.340
Caption: ah ha I know what I&#39;m 1 AD means and now

00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:48.159
Caption: I can take advantage of these things

00:22:44.339 --> 00:22:50.909
Caption: that&#39;s my job that&#39;s my goal and join me

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.910
Caption: thank you for listening

00:22:55.349 --> 00:23:08.439
Caption: let&#39;s go I&#39;m afraid Lee has had to run

00:23:02.288 --> 00:23:11.139
Caption: off so tonight I imagine that Tony is

00:23:08.439 --> 00:23:14.349
Caption: happy to take a couple little questions

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:17.469
Caption: absolutely and possibly our speakers are

00:23:14.349 --> 00:23:20.020
Caption: as well but maybe what we should do

00:23:17.469 --> 00:23:22.089
Caption: instead is in a bit of a pat-down and

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.609
Caption: may be moving across to something like

00:23:22.089 --> 00:23:26.709
Caption: cheeky Sparrow that might be a good

00:23:24.609 --> 00:23:30.400
Caption: opportunity for a lot of questions that

00:23:26.709 --> 00:23:32.439
Caption: haven&#39;t so perhaps we could just ask one

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.570
Caption: or two if anybody has something that

00:23:32.439 --> 00:23:36.819
Caption: they would particularly like to ask Tony

00:23:34.569 --> 00:23:44.558
Caption: and then he found other speakers would

00:23:36.819 --> 00:23:46.509
Caption: like to join us later or as down yep and

00:23:44.558 --> 00:23:48.640
Caption: that way we can wrap it up because I

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:52.780
Caption: know it has been quiet on that is there

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:55.058
Caption: any questions yeah why should I use

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:59.080
Caption: hostel rather than do programming in a

00:23:55.058 --> 00:24:06.250
Caption: functional style of normal good question

00:23:59.079 --> 00:24:08.288
Caption: I get it I get it so I I strongly

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:10.989
Caption: encourage you to try it and I have tried

00:24:08.288 --> 00:24:12.729
Caption: it I could show you the code I&#39;ve done

00:24:10.989 --> 00:24:17.699
Caption: it in Java C sharp and Python and

00:24:12.729 --> 00:24:21.459
Caption: JavaScript and Scala here forget that

00:24:17.699 --> 00:24:23.439
Caption: say that if you do try it you&#39;ll have

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:25.989
Caption: additional problems all right so I would

00:24:23.439 --> 00:24:27.639
Caption: argue that it&#39;s certainly in an

00:24:25.989 --> 00:24:29.890
Caption: educational environment it&#39;s already

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:32.049
Caption: hard enough but suppose you like you&#39;re

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:34.030
Caption: over that you&#39;re like yep I&#39;ve got this

00:24:32.048 --> 00:24:36.250
Caption: covered I&#39;m going to go and use

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:37.479
Caption: JavaScript or something and the problem

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:41.319
Caption: is you&#39;ll start hitting JavaScript

00:24:37.479 --> 00:24:42.520
Caption: problems right so for example that&#39;s

00:24:41.319 --> 00:24:44.109
Caption: some function that I showed you before

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.489
Caption: if you go and write that in JavaScript

00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:48.038
Caption: right now I&#39;m going to give it a list

00:24:45.489 --> 00:24:50.229
Caption: with 10,000 elements it&#39;ll build up a

00:24:48.038 --> 00:24:53.829
Caption: stack of 10,000 and then bang Stack

00:24:50.229 --> 00:24:55.780
Caption: Overflow okay so that&#39;s not to say just

00:24:53.829 --> 00:24:57.279
Caption: that&#39;s you know stop right there don&#39;t

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.530
Caption: do anything and go back to what you&#39;re

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:02.590
Caption: doing before it&#39;s that you then have to

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:04.179
Caption: recognize those penalties exist so you

00:25:02.589 --> 00:25:04.729
Caption: can&#39;t just naively write a sum function

00:25:04.178 --> 00:25:06.829
Caption: anymore

00:25:04.729 --> 00:25:08.959
Caption: you have to be aware of JavaScript&#39;s

00:25:06.829 --> 00:25:11.449
Caption: limitations and this is pretty much true

00:25:08.959 --> 00:25:13.250
Caption: for many other of those languages but I

00:25:11.449 --> 00:25:14.808
Caption: do encourage you to try and get the

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.229
Caption: Stack Overflow and go or what do I do

00:25:14.808 --> 00:25:18.319
Caption: now

00:25:15.229 --> 00:25:19.548
Caption: yeah and in fact one of the projects

00:25:18.319 --> 00:25:21.428
Caption: that so one of the open-source projects

00:25:19.548 --> 00:25:24.918
Caption: on my team is to help you overcome that

00:25:21.428 --> 00:25:28.428
Caption: so if a Python and soon-to-be JavaScript

00:25:24.918 --> 00:25:29.779
Caption: right which is basically I have this

00:25:28.428 --> 00:25:31.039
Caption: problem which is I can convince you that

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.179
Caption: functional programming is the bee&#39;s

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.640
Caption: knees right now and you were completely

00:25:32.178 --> 00:25:35.808
Caption: convinced but you&#39;ve got a million lines

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.619
Caption: of Python back at work

00:25:35.808 --> 00:25:41.329
Caption: well JavaScript or whatever and there&#39;s

00:25:39.619 --> 00:25:43.308
Caption: nothing I can do that can just say well

00:25:41.329 --> 00:25:45.168
Caption: just stop work right now throw all that

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:47.209
Caption: code away and let&#39;s start again because

00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:48.649
Caption: that&#39;s imposing quite a big penalty and

00:25:47.209 --> 00:26:00.199
Caption: I want to try and make that penalty

00:25:48.650 --> 00:26:03.380
Caption: small even zero yeah I just wanted to

00:26:00.199 --> 00:26:05.298
Caption: say thanks so much for didi Perth for

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.770
Caption: organizing this event tonight it&#39;s been

00:26:05.298 --> 00:26:09.109
Caption: awesome I&#39;ve been to their main

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:13.070
Caption: conference before it&#39;s fabulous right

00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:16.640
Caption: I&#39;m actually here for IT professionals

00:26:13.069 --> 00:26:19.369
Caption: Association I have invited members of

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.510
Caption: that group to come along tonight an

00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:23.239
Caption: experienced DDD

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:25.699
Caption: and hopefully help us go through our

00:26:23.239 --> 00:26:28.308
Caption: journey of representing more than just

00:26:25.699 --> 00:26:30.048
Caption: one kind of IT professional because we

00:26:28.308 --> 00:26:32.599
Caption: started out as a group for system

00:26:30.048 --> 00:26:34.219
Caption: administrators we have got a horrid

00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:37.308
Caption: perspective now we&#39;re more about

00:26:34.219 --> 00:26:39.380
Caption: representing technical professionals if

00:26:37.308 --> 00:26:41.209
Caption: anyone is more into policy or managed

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.729
Caption: then ACS is probably a better

00:26:41.209 --> 00:26:45.619
Caption: organization but if you want a group

00:26:43.729 --> 00:26:49.099
Caption: that could help you look for a job help

00:26:45.619 --> 00:26:51.290
Caption: you up skill to get a better job or help

00:26:49.099 --> 00:26:54.109
Caption: you in negotiations with your employer

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:57.500
Caption: as well as just helping you get a sense

00:26:54.109 --> 00:26:59.869
Caption: of like friendship from other IT people

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:03.050
Caption: that you can go to meetings with then

00:26:59.869 --> 00:27:07.510
Caption: speak to me afterwards and ask me about

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:10.610
Caption: the ITP a Thank You Alastair by the way

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:16.190
Caption: so look thank you everyone for coming

00:27:10.609 --> 00:27:19.130
Caption: down to this office db5 we have

00:27:16.189 --> 00:27:21.859
Caption: announced our conference date it is the

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:24.020
Caption: fourth movement we have oceans our
