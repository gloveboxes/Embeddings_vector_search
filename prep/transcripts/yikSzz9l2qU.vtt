00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.449
Caption: afternoon in Rome I hope you enjoyed

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.809
Caption: your lunch and refresh ready for the

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:14.788
Caption: next session though my name is has and

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.750
Caption: today I&#39;m talking about solution

00:00:14.788 --> 00:00:21.319
Caption: architecture for cloud applications the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.909
Caption: this is not neural network this is not

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:26.279
Caption: machine learning this is not cracking

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:29.010
Caption: math this is really more about my

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.680
Caption: experience in transitioning from being

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.909
Caption: the technical lead developed her into

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.909
Caption: solution architect

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.050
Caption: although most of the concepts that we&#39;re

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:42.029
Caption: going to be talking about it is

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:44.220
Caption: architecture it would it would apply not

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:47.309
Caption: only to cloud but also to mobile

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.620
Caption: applications and one firm is web they&#39;re

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.659
Caption: just at the beginning any show of hands

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:53.659
Caption: for how many architects in the room

00:00:54.919 --> 00:01:01.788
Caption: that&#39;s very technical lathe

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.809
Caption: yeah cool that&#39;s good so I have nothing

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.779
Caption: against architect

00:01:02.808 --> 00:01:07.639
Caption: I personally moved into the solution

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:10.868
Caption: architecture all about hue months ago

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:12.919
Caption: I&#39;ve been working as a consultant

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.979
Caption: technical lead for the last two or three

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:17.360
Caption: years and recently moved into this

00:01:14.978 --> 00:01:19.008
Caption: solution architect role so I&#39;ll share

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.729
Caption: with you the challenges and the the

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.950
Caption: things that I&#39;m I&#39;m seeing and this is

00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:26.750
Caption: all from my perspective this is just my

00:01:24.949 --> 00:01:30.788
Caption: perception of things so take it with a

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.709
Caption: grain of salt so just a bit of warning

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.380
Caption: architecture can be very fluffy and very

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:38.539
Caption: abstract I promise I won&#39;t bore you with

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:40.788
Caption: any UML diagrams or anything I&#39;ll try to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.520
Caption: make it as relevant as possible but just

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.289
Caption: bear with me plus just to add to that I

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:46.639
Caption: didn&#39;t really have enough sleep last

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.569
Caption: night so I flew from Melbourne last

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:53.089
Caption: night so just to start let&#39;s start with

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:57.708
Caption: a contentious subject developer versus

00:01:53.089 --> 00:02:00.458
Caption: architect so again this is just my

00:01:57.708 --> 00:02:02.750
Caption: perception of things this is not

00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:06.889
Caption: research paper saying okay this is how

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:11.208
Caption: things are so you would find that there

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:12.679
Caption: are a lot of young developers and more

00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:14.360
Caption: and more you seeing people coming into

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:17.329
Caption: the development space because it&#39;s very

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.089
Caption: interesting it&#39;s very enjoyable thing to

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.069
Caption: do but you wouldn&#39;t see architects just

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:24.199
Caption: getting out of uni going into the

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.119
Caption: architect role so you ideally you would

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.009
Caption: have at least 10 15 years of experience

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.089
Caption: and it depends on what sort of architect

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:33.679
Caption: you are you&#39;re probably going to need

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:36.110
Caption: more so naturally the the age of an

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:38.089
Caption: architect would be slightly higher or

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.958
Caption: probably a bit more or higher than then

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:43.220
Caption: of a developer in terms of leadership

00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:45.348
Caption: leadership is not really a title that

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.940
Caption: you give to somebody so some people are

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:48.589
Caption: just natural leader so you&#39;ll see many

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.589
Caption: developers are really influencers in

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:54.259
Caption: their teams but it&#39;s not really they

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:56.569
Caption: don&#39;t have the authority it&#39;s not really

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:58.759
Caption: part of their job responsibilities but

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.360
Caption: you see with architects it&#39;s really part

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:03.139
Caption: of their job they are paid to do that so

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.309
Caption: they need to make sure that they are

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.919
Caption: steering the conversation in the right

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:10.279
Caption: direction now with security and quality

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:11.958
Caption: they are pretty much on all layers on

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.259
Caption: all levels of software development so

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.809
Caption: you

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:16.488
Caption: everywhere and that&#39;s why architects or

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:18.919
Caption: developers they would probably work

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:22.190
Caption: collaboratively on that now in terms of

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:24.679
Caption: governance and vision for most

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.150
Caption: developers they don&#39;t really think that

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:27.529
Caption: they are it&#39;s part of their jobs and

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:28.610
Caption: it&#39;s it I think they are writing in

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:32.598
Caption: thinking so

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.669
Caption: but for architects it&#39;s really if

00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:37.729
Caption: something goes south it&#39;s going to be

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:41.029
Caption: really you to blame because you are paid

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.958
Caption: to make sure that the development is

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:45.169
Caption: going in the direction that the

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:47.589
Caption: organization wants stakeholder

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.848
Caption: management again it&#39;s part of the

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:53.238
Caption: architectural not really much so from

00:03:49.848 --> 00:03:56.000
Caption: the developer perspective and lastly but

00:03:53.238 --> 00:03:58.309
Caption: quite importantly the pay so when you go

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.708
Caption: from a developer into an architect there

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:04.009
Caption: is a very decent jump as well now I&#39;ll

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:06.440
Caption: be very honest with you I thought it&#39;s

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:08.958
Caption: more fun than it is when I&#39;m doing it

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.729
Caption: now and there are days or sometimes even

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.048
Caption: weeks where I wish that I just go back

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:14.059
Caption: into development because I just want to

00:04:12.048 --> 00:04:15.828
Caption: focus on doing done rather than

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:17.869
Caption: just talking to peoples and going into

00:04:15.828 --> 00:04:20.708
Caption: meetings and trying to explain things

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:22.989
Caption: and just throwing them on whiteboards so

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.669
Caption: the point I&#39;m trying to make here is

00:04:22.989 --> 00:04:29.089
Caption: although it might sound catchy to be an

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.130
Caption: architect it might not be the best thing

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:32.779
Caption: for you and I&#39;m still myself trying to

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.429
Caption: figure out whether it&#39;s really best for

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:36.679
Caption: me or maybe I just moved into software

00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:39.169
Caption: development sorry I mean as a developer

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:41.109
Caption: there you need to think about whether

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.940
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s the best thing for you or not

00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:48.409
Caption: now architects also come in different

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.660
Caption: colors and shapes and forms so I thought

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.029
Caption: it would be good to just take a moment

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.830
Caption: and this told what the different titles

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:55.970
Caption: are so the ones that are related to

00:04:54.829 --> 00:04:57.829
Caption: solution architecture that we&#39;re talking

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.959
Caption: about here there is one which is the

00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:03.409
Caption: kind of the umbrella which is the

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:04.699
Caption: Enterprise Architect the Enterprise

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.669
Caption: Architect normally you would see it in a

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.370
Caption: big enterprises where they have mostly

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:13.669
Caption: and say in finance or in government or

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:15.199
Caption: in health you will see that they have

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.690
Caption: complex systems they have multiple

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.369
Caption: components so if they would have

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.309
Caption: Enterprise Architect their design would

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:23.779
Caption: be very high-level normally they would

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:26.139
Caption: have at least 20 plus years of

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:28.089
Caption: experience they don&#39;t really do

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.669
Caption: much technical detail and they&#39;re

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:32.619
Caption: designed and they are spanned across the

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.929
Caption: organization multiple projects multiple

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:37.089
Caption: teams and then underneath that you will

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:40.059
Caption: have the solution architects which is

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:41.468
Caption: what we&#39;re talking about today where

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:42.609
Caption: they are focused on the solutions so

00:05:41.468 --> 00:05:44.619
Caption: there would be multiple components

00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:47.559
Caption: typically they would work full multiple

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:49.839
Caption: projects multiple teams and their design

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:51.459
Caption: is very detailed and then you will have

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.899
Caption: the application architects or the tech

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:54.128
Caption: lead where they are focused on the

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:56.859
Caption: particular projects that they are

00:05:54.128 --> 00:05:58.389
Caption: focused on and they are more concerned

00:05:56.859 --> 00:05:59.739
Caption: by with components reuse in the

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.229
Caption: application that they are working on so

00:05:59.739 --> 00:06:04.598
Caption: maybe they don&#39;t have the full vision of

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.250
Caption: the sphere of control on what&#39;s

00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:08.949
Caption: happening outside of their project so

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.158
Caption: they are focused on on that narrow but

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:14.919
Caption: then their their work would be highly

00:06:12.158 --> 00:06:18.269
Caption: detailed design and they work day to day

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.270
Caption: with the developers

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:24.869
Caption: so this one is not my take this is

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:28.390
Caption: coming from the great source Wikipedia

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:29.799
Caption: so I wanted to share what are the

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.180
Caption: concerns that I&#39;m facing and building

00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:36.849
Caption: the our our cloud application versus

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:39.309
Caption: offering first selecting the cloud

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.630
Caption: providers now this is not really the

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:43.089
Caption: call for the developer

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.260
Caption: now everybody would have saying in this

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:46.359
Caption: there are multiple shareholders

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.660
Caption: obviously ease of development or quicken

00:06:46.359 --> 00:06:50.919
Caption: going to market people from the finance

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.080
Caption: department they will have a say in this

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.610
Caption: but it really comes down to the

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.919
Caption: architect who&#39;s going to be putting on

00:06:54.609 --> 00:06:59.049
Caption: their architect ID and hat and saying

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.310
Caption: okay based on these metrics that we have

00:06:59.049 --> 00:07:02.769
Caption: defined this is what we&#39;re going to be

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:05.320
Caption: going with choosing the compute unit and

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:06.459
Caption: the data storage unit how are you going

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.220
Caption: to store your data how are you going to

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:13.149
Caption: work with with this data are you going

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.619
Caption: to make sure that it&#39;s secure how are

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:16.089
Caption: you going to make sure that you have

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:18.130
Caption: full vision of what&#39;s happening in the

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:20.609
Caption: application at runtime if something goes

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.720
Caption: wrong how are you going to diagnose it

00:07:20.609 --> 00:07:24.369
Caption: business continuity how do you make sure

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.149
Caption: that the business is still going to be

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:30.970
Caption: sustainable and resilient the apps are

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:32.229
Caption: going to be available and governance how

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.880
Caption: do you make sure that the architecture

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:37.930
Caption: that you building today is still going

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:39.339
Caption: to be relevant and still in action in a

00:07:37.929 --> 00:07:41.709
Caption: year and a half time or two years or

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:44.500
Caption: five years time the first choosing cloud

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:46.239
Caption: provider it really there are so many

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.549
Caption: different factors that get involved but

00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:50.919
Caption: I just wanted to I thought of putting

00:07:48.549 --> 00:07:52.899
Caption: what has been relevant to me in the

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.300
Caption: current role that I&#39;m working on so the

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:57.190
Caption: type of load that we put in whether it&#39;s

00:07:55.299 --> 00:07:58.569
Caption: a legacy application whether it&#39;s a

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.239
Caption: modern application whether there is a

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.920
Caption: buzz offering that&#39;s supporting it the

00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:05.459
Caption: size of load that you&#39;re putting so for

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.550
Caption: example if you&#39;re guaranteed

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:10.229
Caption: as your pals for example by default you

00:08:08.549 --> 00:08:12.149
Caption: will get I think if you go with the

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:15.360
Caption: standard option you will get three

00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:18.570
Caption: instances each would have one CPU I

00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:21.089
Caption: think or sorry to core and if you

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:23.130
Caption: upgrade from that you get up to ten now

00:08:21.089 --> 00:08:24.839
Caption: that&#39;s not to say that Azure cannot give

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.369
Caption: you the full load but you would need to

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:27.989
Caption: go with a different computer option now

00:08:26.369 --> 00:08:29.100
Caption: is that going to be the the best that

00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:31.049
Caption: you want so you&#39;re going to need to

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.000
Caption: weigh these options to decide what are

00:08:31.049 --> 00:08:35.880
Caption: you going to choose

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.359
Caption: now SLI terms this is a very common

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:41.460
Caption: things to overlook two years ago I was

00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:44.339
Caption: working in a start-up in in Melbourne

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.520
Caption: and we developed this IOT solution we

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:50.760
Caption: built it on based on placed on top of

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:54.420
Caption: Azure as your IOT hub and close to the

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.460
Caption: release date we realize that we made

00:08:54.419 --> 00:08:58.380
Caption: some assumptions because Microsoft talks

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.119
Caption: if you read the documentation of the IOT

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.710
Caption: hub they talk a lot about the throughput

00:09:00.119 --> 00:09:02.849
Caption: and the speed in which that they are

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.920
Caption: going to process these messages and

00:09:02.849 --> 00:09:07.440
Caption: forward them but what we didn&#39;t take

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:09.510
Caption: into account latency and they change

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.039
Caption: something with latency and our systems

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.869
Caption: start breaking down and then when we

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:15.000
Caption: started after two weeks of interaction

00:09:12.869 --> 00:09:18.450
Caption: with Microsoft realized that there was

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.070
Caption: no close in the SLA for the IOT hub that

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.750
Caption: says anything about latency the might

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.830
Caption: have said okay sorry well we didn&#39;t put

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.650
Caption: anything there because we cannot

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.720
Caption: guarantee your latency so our design was

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.490
Caption: flawed and we had to go into like a

00:09:27.719 --> 00:09:31.559
Caption: month of work just to make sure that we

00:09:29.489 --> 00:09:32.700
Caption: can do something that works with with

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:34.650
Caption: the architecture that we built our

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.359
Caption: system on so it&#39;s very high it&#39;s very

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.520
Caption: important to make sure that you&#39;re

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:40.559
Caption: reading your SLA you are meeting the

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.200
Caption: terms and conditions that you are

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:45.630
Caption: required to me

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.100
Caption: certifications if you are working with

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:50.950
Caption: financial institute or health I&#39;ve

00:09:48.099 --> 00:09:52.659
Caption: worked a lot with health organizations

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.010
Caption: and they would require certain

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:55.379
Caption: certifications for the system and when

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:59.169
Caption: you are where you are deploying it to

00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:01.088
Caption: data centers and geo regions so what are

00:09:59.169 --> 00:10:02.588
Caption: you deploying if you have this is very

00:10:01.088 --> 00:10:04.989
Caption: important when it comes into data

00:10:02.588 --> 00:10:07.450
Caption: sovereignty so if you if your clients

00:10:04.989 --> 00:10:08.799
Caption: are forcing you to have your data within

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.239
Caption: their region or within their country

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:11.380
Caption: they are going to you&#39;re going to need

00:10:10.239 --> 00:10:13.708
Caption: to make sure that there is a region

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.700
Caption: where you are targeting your users and

00:10:13.708 --> 00:10:18.039
Caption: core services so if you if you&#39;re

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:20.890
Caption: getting with the hybrid model on-premise

00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:21.789
Caption: and in the cloud then it&#39;s going to

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.160
Caption: you&#39;re going to need to make sure that

00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:26.079
Caption: there is the network infrastructure the

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:29.229
Caption: VPN what not that&#39;s going to help you

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.440
Caption: achieve that application services so

00:10:29.229 --> 00:10:31.440
Caption: what&#39;s

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.170
Caption: going if you&#39;re going to deploy for

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.720
Caption: example an asp.net application that&#39;s

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:41.820
Caption: targeting full dotnet framework

00:10:39.719 --> 00:10:43.289
Caption: you cannot deploy it as a path offering

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.179
Caption: for example on Google Cloud you have to

00:10:43.289 --> 00:10:48.839
Caption: deploy it either as a container service

00:10:45.179 --> 00:10:51.149
Caption: or in deploy asp.net core so these are

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.710
Caption: also going to be factors to impact your

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:55.000
Caption: decision which cloud provider you&#39;re

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:56.860
Caption: going to go with

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.710
Caption: so one would ask how about price how

00:10:56.859 --> 00:11:01.329
Caption: about cost and cost is a very

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.880
Caption: interesting subject but you will find

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:06.790
Caption: that most cloud providers they provide

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.960
Caption: quite a similar number quite similar

00:11:06.789 --> 00:11:10.059
Caption: numbers when you when you look at them

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:13.630
Caption: and it&#39;s very hard to compare them as

00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:15.700
Caption: Apple to Apple because everyone they

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:18.460
Caption: have their own obviously features and as

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:21.580
Caption: offerings and the numbers are quite hard

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:24.790
Caption: to match plus there was a survey I think

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:26.440
Caption: it was last year that was 82% of

00:11:24.789 --> 00:11:30.130
Caption: enterprises that were surveyed they were

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:32.020
Caption: saying that they wanted a multi cloud

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:33.609
Caption: vendor strategy so they don&#39;t want to be

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.230
Caption: locked in into one particular cloud

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:37.029
Caption: vendor so you would want to make sure

00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:40.989
Caption: that the solution that you&#39;re building

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:43.360
Caption: would be portable you could you could

00:11:40.989 --> 00:11:46.570
Caption: span across multiple than theirs if you

00:11:43.359 --> 00:11:49.419
Caption: need it to the choosing computing or

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.739
Caption: computing it um many of these things we

00:11:49.419 --> 00:11:52.659
Caption: have already touched on so everybody

00:11:50.739 --> 00:11:54.880
Caption: knows about infrastructure service on

00:11:52.659 --> 00:11:57.219
Caption: the left and functional servers on the

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.840
Caption: right on the left you get poor control

00:11:57.219 --> 00:12:00.129
Caption: you get full overhead obviously and

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.750
Caption: there is full cost there is a lot of

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.640
Caption: cost in ball but if you if you&#39;re

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.859
Caption: spinning up a virtual machine say in

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.390
Caption: edger you spin it probably seven or

00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:09.070
Caption: eight component so you have the the

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.410
Caption: virtual machine the compute instance

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.910
Caption: itself you have the hard drive you have

00:12:11.409 --> 00:12:15.159
Caption: the network interface card you have the

00:12:12.909 --> 00:12:18.339
Caption: IP address you have the network security

00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:19.599
Caption: group so you pay a lot and plus you&#39;re

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.360
Caption: gonna need to manage that patch it

00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:23.319
Caption: yourself so there&#39;s a lot of overhead

00:12:21.359 --> 00:12:27.099
Caption: there is a container of the service

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:29.580
Caption: which is better but then every cloud

00:12:27.099 --> 00:12:32.880
Caption: provider would have their own way of

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:35.110
Caption: providing you with this service so

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:39.220
Caption: Google for example provide you with

00:12:35.109 --> 00:12:41.200
Caption: kubernetes but then they take care of

00:12:39.219 --> 00:12:42.279
Caption: managing the master instances for you so

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.290
Caption: you don&#39;t need to worry about it

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.210
Caption: handling all the loads and payloads and

00:12:44.289 --> 00:12:47.769
Caption: whatnot which is good if you are trying

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.679
Caption: to grow into the market quick but then

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:53.770
Caption: you&#39;re going to need to think about the

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:55.809
Caption: vendor lock down path offering which is

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.640
Caption: my default option that I go to whenever

00:12:55.809 --> 00:12:59.469
Caption: I start a project if I can&#39;t handle it

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.109
Caption: there then I&#39;ll go into investigating

00:12:59.469 --> 00:13:03.838
Caption: other options and then functional the

00:13:02.109 --> 00:13:06.099
Caption: service now there are a lot of people

00:13:03.838 --> 00:13:07.270
Caption: nowadays that think functionalized

00:13:06.099 --> 00:13:08.208
Caption: service is going to be just the next big

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.139
Caption: thing and

00:13:08.208 --> 00:13:12.758
Caption: everything is just going to move into

00:13:09.138 --> 00:13:16.308
Caption: functional service I&#39;ve tend to disagree

00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:18.438
Caption: because although functional service is

00:13:16.309 --> 00:13:20.209
Caption: great its computing as utility you can

00:13:18.439 --> 00:13:21.619
Caption: you can put your load there and then

00:13:20.208 --> 00:13:24.318
Caption: it&#39;s just going to be handled for you

00:13:21.619 --> 00:13:26.389
Caption: you don&#39;t need to worry about failover

00:13:24.318 --> 00:13:28.219
Caption: and scalability and whatnot however

00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:30.169
Caption: there are there is more to it than just

00:13:28.219 --> 00:13:33.698
Caption: compute if you read the terms and

00:13:30.169 --> 00:13:36.349
Caption: conditions from Asia for example or from

00:13:33.698 --> 00:13:37.998
Caption: let&#39;s look at this example first and

00:13:36.349 --> 00:13:41.028
Caption: then I&#39;ll tell you about the terms and

00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:43.100
Caption: conditions if you look at if your code

00:13:41.028 --> 00:13:45.318
Caption: is there in the function of the service

00:13:43.099 --> 00:13:47.928
Caption: and typically you&#39;re going to have some

00:13:45.318 --> 00:13:49.188
Caption: data storage they as your SQL or some

00:13:47.929 --> 00:13:51.170
Caption: other thing and you&#39;re going to have

00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:53.149
Caption: some logging and monitoring tools that

00:13:51.169 --> 00:13:56.989
Caption: you have somewhere and in the in the

00:13:53.148 --> 00:13:59.328
Caption: most rudimental huh if you if you&#39;re

00:13:56.989 --> 00:14:01.938
Caption: scaling your function as a service and

00:13:59.328 --> 00:14:04.308
Caption: you&#39;re getting multiple instances let&#39;s

00:14:01.939 --> 00:14:06.619
Caption: say you got too much load its peak

00:14:04.309 --> 00:14:08.240
Caption: season Christmas time and you&#39;ve got too

00:14:06.619 --> 00:14:10.920
Caption: many people coming in to your website

00:14:08.239 --> 00:14:12.989
Caption: this is Panda

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:14.700
Caption: if you got say a thousand instances

00:14:12.989 --> 00:14:16.349
Caption: running at the same time have you got

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.210
Caption: thousand connections going into your

00:14:16.349 --> 00:14:19.440
Caption: database at the same time is your

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.650
Caption: database is going to be able to handle

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.989
Caption: that now connections is just one way but

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.400
Caption: how about security for example there are

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:27.929
Caption: a lot more aspects that you&#39;re going to

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.570
Caption: need to think about it you need to think

00:14:27.929 --> 00:14:32.130
Caption: about more holistically is your

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:35.840
Caption: monitoring environment going to be able

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:40.380
Caption: to handle that load to scale with your

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:42.300
Caption: computer if you read they find prints

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:45.299
Caption: they say we will provide you with all

00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:47.369
Caption: the computational resources required for

00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:49.229
Caption: your instance for your application so

00:14:47.369 --> 00:14:51.299
Caption: that&#39;s just compute compute instance

00:14:49.229 --> 00:14:54.029
Caption: that&#39;s not really any other dependencies

00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:56.849
Caption: your application gonna have so that&#39;s

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:58.800
Caption: just one thing to consider I found this

00:14:56.849 --> 00:15:01.109
Caption: very relevant and it&#39;s very funny um I

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:03.359
Caption: think last year in in Queensland and

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:06.179
Caption: they built new train lines and they

00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:07.769
Caption: built new trains and whatnot and when

00:15:06.179 --> 00:15:08.969
Caption: they came in to the release and they

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.820
Caption: realized that they didn&#39;t have enough

00:15:08.969 --> 00:15:12.989
Caption: drivers so they scaled their trains and

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.789
Caption: their train lines but they didn&#39;t have

00:15:12.989 --> 00:15:16.529
Caption: driver said it didn&#39;t have a were able

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:17.940
Caption: to change their timetables and I think

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.680
Caption: they are still suffering from it so if

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.659
Caption: you read the time from this article it&#39;s

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:23.489
Caption: still there irrelevant September 2017

00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:25.019
Caption: this was like last year or the year

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:26.520
Caption: before and they are still suffering from

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.200
Caption: the same problem they look at your

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.390
Caption: system holistically this is this is the

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:34.100
Caption: lesson that I have learned if you&#39;re

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:36.450
Caption: interested in choosing a compute

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:39.059
Caption: instance and you want to read about more

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.650
Caption: there was a great talk by Rob and Matt

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:43.349
Caption: who are both in the organizing committee

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:46.080
Caption: for DDD Perth they did they gave this

00:15:43.349 --> 00:15:49.729
Caption: talk in NDC Sydney last month and I put

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.730
Caption: the link here so if anybody interested

00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:54.179
Caption: the next thing we&#39;re gonna look at is

00:15:52.169 --> 00:15:56.039
Caption: choosing a data storage so there are so

00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:57.419
Caption: many variation of so many different

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:58.739
Caption: offerings for data storage where where

00:15:57.419 --> 00:16:01.079
Caption: are you going to put your data how do

00:15:58.739 --> 00:16:03.330
Caption: you make this decision as an architect

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.710
Caption: you&#39;re going to be hold accountable for

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.150
Caption: that and it&#39;s going to it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:09.030
Caption: possibly a decision that&#39;s going to make

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:12.280
Caption: or break your your application so for me

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:15.280
Caption: when I try to summarize this

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:18.790
Caption: before before I summarize it my recipe

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.920
Caption: normally when I face a tough choice like

00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:23.049
Caption: this going into a place that I haven&#39;t

00:16:20.919 --> 00:16:25.119
Caption: been before making the decision that

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:26.260
Caption: they have been made before using a

00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:28.659
Caption: technology or frame will get too heavy

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.910
Caption: news I try to give myself enough time so

00:16:28.659 --> 00:16:32.619
Caption: I&#39;ll make at least time for three or

00:16:30.909 --> 00:16:34.809
Caption: four hours of just reading with open

00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:36.460
Caption: mind critically thinking forgetting

00:16:34.809 --> 00:16:38.260
Caption: about my biases forgetting about what I

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.480
Caption: want to do or what I enjoy doing but

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.340
Caption: just take that time and think about it

00:16:40.479 --> 00:16:45.699
Caption: read about it learn as much as you can

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:47.410
Caption: and then try to build as much as proof

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:50.520
Caption: of concepts or side projects things that

00:16:47.409 --> 00:16:53.409
Caption: you would use as play with teetee to

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.929
Caption: gauge whether this is going to be fit or

00:16:53.409 --> 00:16:58.000
Caption: not so the first thing in my summary was

00:16:55.929 --> 00:17:00.609
Caption: whether the data is structured or not

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.280
Caption: structured the volume and the velocity

00:17:00.609 --> 00:17:06.568
Caption: or the data is coming in the data

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.969
Caption: consistency they

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:12.658
Caption: debbie is becoming a big thing or astray

00:17:08.969 --> 00:17:14.338
Caption: for example from Amazon if these vendors

00:17:12.659 --> 00:17:15.630
Caption: are giving telling you that your data is

00:17:14.338 --> 00:17:18.239
Caption: going to be replicated across multiple

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:20.099
Caption: regions and it&#39;s great

00:17:18.239 --> 00:17:22.739
Caption: is your data going to be consistent at

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:24.328
Caption: any point in time at at all nodes but if

00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:25.889
Caption: somebody may transfer from their bank

00:17:24.328 --> 00:17:28.408
Caption: account in London and at the same time

00:17:25.889 --> 00:17:30.899
Caption: they try to do the same transaction from

00:17:28.409 --> 00:17:33.509
Caption: their account but they try to do it from

00:17:30.899 --> 00:17:35.759
Caption: Sydney for example is your data going to

00:17:33.509 --> 00:17:37.979
Caption: be consistent in real time that&#39;s that

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:39.899
Caption: data consistency and I found it very

00:17:37.979 --> 00:17:41.908
Caption: impressive that cosmos DB for example

00:17:39.899 --> 00:17:43.259
Caption: gives you the ability to choose what

00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:45.120
Caption: level of consistency you want whether

00:17:43.259 --> 00:17:46.799
Caption: eventual or strict constancy but

00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:49.439
Caption: obviously that comes with a cost

00:17:46.798 --> 00:17:51.839
Caption: it cost a lot of money and performance

00:17:49.439 --> 00:17:53.829
Caption: is not not I found it not great at least

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:56.199
Caption: in my case

00:17:53.829 --> 00:17:59.000
Caption: data partitioning so that&#39;s for chasm

00:17:56.199 --> 00:18:01.250
Caption: for performance so if you have

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.910
Caption: you&#39;re offering a sass offering and you

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:07.160
Caption: have customer a and they are all all

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.930
Caption: your data is holding the same storage

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.670
Caption: unit you want to make sure that customer

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.900
Caption: a cannot access data from customer B

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.549
Caption: because they are all the same database

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.339
Caption: right

00:18:13.548 --> 00:18:18.589
Caption: and data sovereignty so the the current

00:18:16.339 --> 00:18:20.928
Caption: application what I&#39;m working on it&#39;s for

00:18:18.589 --> 00:18:22.699
Caption: researchers in government and health

00:18:20.928 --> 00:18:24.798
Caption: organisations and they want to have data

00:18:22.699 --> 00:18:27.668
Caption: sovereignty if researcher is putting

00:18:24.798 --> 00:18:30.849
Caption: their data and doing their surveys and

00:18:27.668 --> 00:18:34.158
Caption: they are based in the UK for example I

00:18:30.849 --> 00:18:35.959
Caption: cannot just replicate their data across

00:18:34.159 --> 00:18:37.100
Caption: multiple regions their data has to stay

00:18:35.959 --> 00:18:38.599
Caption: within their region or if the

00:18:37.099 --> 00:18:40.369
Caption: researchers signing up from Australia

00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:42.859
Caption: their data has to stay in within

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:46.009
Caption: Australia and that brings a lot of

00:18:42.859 --> 00:18:47.389
Caption: challenges to solve but it also helps

00:18:46.009 --> 00:18:50.259
Caption: you with making the decision for which

00:18:47.389 --> 00:18:50.259
Caption: storage unit to go to

00:18:51.369 --> 00:18:53.640
Caption: so

00:18:54.269 --> 00:18:58.950
Caption: three years ago I was working for a

00:18:56.129 --> 00:19:01.379
Caption: consulting for a retail big retail

00:18:58.949 --> 00:19:03.418
Caption: company in Malden and I found that they

00:19:01.379 --> 00:19:05.729
Caption: were using as your table storage for

00:19:03.418 --> 00:19:07.498
Caption: cashing everybody would laugh at it

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:09.958
Caption: because as your table storage are very

00:19:07.499 --> 00:19:11.729
Caption: slow everybody who used them they would

00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:14.098
Caption: know they are slow especially if you

00:19:11.729 --> 00:19:15.598
Caption: don&#39;t use the partition key properly and

00:19:14.098 --> 00:19:17.428
Caption: then I found that the the story behind

00:19:15.598 --> 00:19:20.098
Caption: it was that they were trying to use

00:19:17.428 --> 00:19:21.628
Caption: ready sketch as you write sketch but it

00:19:20.098 --> 00:19:23.428
Caption: wasn&#39;t available to as in preview at the

00:19:21.629 --> 00:19:24.659
Caption: time and then they thought well we&#39;re

00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:25.768
Caption: just going to use at your table storage

00:19:24.659 --> 00:19:27.570
Caption: for now and then we&#39;ll switch it later

00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:29.009
Caption: but it was lowering the system down

00:19:27.569 --> 00:19:33.569
Caption: actually rather than giving them any

00:19:29.009 --> 00:19:34.979
Caption: boost because you tried to use caching

00:19:33.569 --> 00:19:37.798
Caption: to speed up your application but

00:19:34.979 --> 00:19:40.619
Caption: obviously you&#39;re getting a penalty so I

00:19:37.798 --> 00:19:42.118
Caption: have a small demo in this demo I&#39;m just

00:19:40.619 --> 00:19:45.088
Caption: going to show you so I&#39;m taking some

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:47.879
Caption: data checking for system status taking

00:19:45.088 --> 00:19:48.958
Caption: the data putting it into Azure SQL and

00:19:47.879 --> 00:19:51.299
Caption: they&#39;re taking bad putting it into

00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:55.588
Caption: energy or cosmos DB taking it from that

00:19:51.298 --> 00:19:58.798
Caption: putting it into Amazon s3 and then

00:19:55.588 --> 00:20:01.769
Caption: putting it into Google Cloud database

00:19:58.798 --> 00:20:04.109
Caption: now there is no application that&#39;s going

00:20:01.769 --> 00:20:09.419
Caption: to do all that obviously but it&#39;s just a

00:20:04.109 --> 00:20:11.808
Caption: way of showing you the my very

00:20:09.418 --> 00:20:15.148
Caption: rudimentary proof of concept for

00:20:11.808 --> 00:20:17.189
Caption: checking the timing and whether it&#39;s

00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:20.790
Caption: going to be suitable for my user or not

00:20:17.189 --> 00:20:22.769
Caption: if I&#39;m going to start this

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.090
Caption: there what&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen while

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:28.160
Caption: it&#39;s running I&#39;m going to show you so

00:20:24.089 --> 00:20:28.159
Caption: basically what what we have here is

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:36.510
Caption: what we have here is I&#39;m getting the

00:20:34.479 --> 00:20:39.400
Caption: system status and I&#39;m starting at a

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:41.290
Caption: stopwatch and starting getting to your

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:45.150
Caption: SQL database and then taking it from

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.150
Caption: that is your database

00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:51.599
Caption: okay that&#39;s alright and then inserting

00:20:48.928 --> 00:20:57.269
Caption: it into cosmos DB taking it from cosmos

00:20:51.599 --> 00:21:01.459
Caption: DB T Amazon s3 and then taking it from

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:03.619
Caption: that into Google Cloud

00:21:01.459 --> 00:21:06.649
Caption: so although everybody would agree that

00:21:03.619 --> 00:21:08.209
Caption: this is nowhere close to a good proof of

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:09.290
Caption: concept for timing because there are so

00:21:08.209 --> 00:21:11.119
Caption: many factors that you&#39;re going to need

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.130
Caption: to take into account what&#39;s the gear

00:21:11.119 --> 00:21:15.319
Caption: that you&#39;re taking from each but even

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:17.979
Caption: with the simplest proof of concept you

00:21:15.319 --> 00:21:17.979
Caption: can find that

00:21:18.089 --> 00:21:22.229
Caption: the timing is quite different so if I&#39;m

00:21:20.249 --> 00:21:23.909
Caption: trying to make a decision and timing was

00:21:22.229 --> 00:21:26.699
Caption: more important to me than consistency

00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:30.149
Caption: for example I&#39;ll be leaning towards for

00:21:26.699 --> 00:21:33.808
Caption: example s3 or maybe Google cloud

00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:39.799
Caption: database for reading is it easy to read

00:21:33.808 --> 00:21:39.798
Caption: sorry now okay let&#39;s try

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:57.460
Caption: is it easier trainer yeah you will say

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:59.349
Caption: that if if I&#39;m trying to you will see

00:21:57.459 --> 00:22:03.308
Caption: the difference here in reading it&#39;s two

00:21:59.349 --> 00:22:05.530
Caption: hundred millisecond but in other

00:22:03.308 --> 00:22:07.959
Caption: instances it&#39;s it&#39;s much longer so here

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:10.119
Caption: for example Google cloud database taken

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:12.939
Caption: seven hundred and even with the most

00:22:10.119 --> 00:22:15.579
Caption: fundamental the the free tier from as

00:22:12.939 --> 00:22:19.119
Caption: your SQL database is giving me less time

00:22:15.579 --> 00:22:21.189
Caption: there with with right you will find even

00:22:19.119 --> 00:22:24.819
Caption: more variation so this is like three

00:22:21.189 --> 00:22:27.729
Caption: times the the amount of time that&#39;s

00:22:24.819 --> 00:22:29.589
Caption: taking for for writing so it&#39;s very easy

00:22:27.729 --> 00:22:34.239
Caption: to just spin up this these kind of

00:22:29.589 --> 00:22:36.039
Caption: things it&#39;s very easy to spin up this

00:22:34.239 --> 00:22:39.219
Caption: kind of proof of concepts and it would

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.320
Caption: help you to make the right decisions on

00:22:39.219 --> 00:22:43.959
Caption: whether this is going to be fit for you

00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:45.969
Caption: or not and obviously it&#39;s going to be

00:22:43.959 --> 00:22:48.609
Caption: dependent on your circumstances and your

00:22:45.969 --> 00:22:50.229
Caption: data that you have I&#39;m going to be

00:22:48.609 --> 00:22:51.910
Caption: sharing the code on on github after this

00:22:50.229 --> 00:22:57.030
Caption: so if anybody is interested you can you

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:57.030
Caption: can get access to that okay

00:23:03.449 --> 00:23:08.459
Caption: you

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:11.820
Caption: the security with security is really the

00:23:08.459 --> 00:23:14.880
Caption: objective is is always confidentiality

00:23:11.819 --> 00:23:16.979
Caption: the data is not accessed by anybody

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:19.910
Caption: integrity the data is not tampered with

00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:22.589
Caption: or destructed by anybody availability

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:25.140
Caption: the the system is resilient against the

00:23:22.589 --> 00:23:26.459
Caption: now distributed denial of service and

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.560
Caption: accountability if something goes wrong

00:23:26.459 --> 00:23:31.699
Caption: we have traceability we have something

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:34.710
Caption: that we can rely on to to give us that

00:23:31.699 --> 00:23:37.139
Caption: the picture of what&#39;s happening there in

00:23:34.709 --> 00:23:38.880
Caption: terms of approach they standard I&#39;m not

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.329
Caption: claiming to be an expert in security but

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.750
Caption: this is this is what but I I do

00:23:41.329 --> 00:23:47.489
Caption: authentication authorization is normally

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:49.290
Caption: standard information hiding whether it&#39;s

00:23:47.489 --> 00:23:51.599
Caption: by cryptography or by naming your data

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:56.130
Caption: differently auditing for intrusion

00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:57.839
Caption: detection and very interesting you&#39;ll

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.729
Caption: find a lot of cloud providers provide

00:23:57.839 --> 00:24:01.289
Caption: you now with platform service for inter

00:23:59.729 --> 00:24:04.260
Caption: region detection for detecting any

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:07.290
Caption: malware or any malicious attack or

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:08.790
Caption: malicious access to your data multi

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.590
Caption: security layers is thinking about your

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:13.229
Caption: security in all the levels that you are

00:24:10.589 --> 00:24:16.169
Caption: accessing your data and using the tool

00:24:13.229 --> 00:24:17.339
Caption: so there are many tools I use sneak for

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:20.010
Caption: example it helps you with identifying

00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:24.319
Caption: any vulnerabilities in your your data

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:24.320
Caption: and it helps you solve them

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.920
Caption: operations and monitoring I think we

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:33.290
Caption: touched on that real-time monitoring is

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.900
Caption: your monitoring platform going to be

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:38.510
Caption: scaling with with your compute and data

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.760
Caption: instances and choosing the right

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.589
Caption: platform and framework for for the for

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.050
Caption: the job

00:24:41.589 --> 00:24:46.919
Caption: traceability so if you have a cloud

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.330
Caption: operation

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.739
Caption: it&#39;s more likely that you&#39;re going to

00:24:48.329 --> 00:24:51.209
Caption: have multiple components and multiple

00:24:49.739 --> 00:24:53.339
Caption: apps that are running at the same time

00:24:51.209 --> 00:24:55.109
Caption: so you would want to make sure that you

00:24:53.339 --> 00:24:57.390
Caption: have a way of correlating the messages

00:24:55.109 --> 00:24:58.589
Caption: and the data are going from one end to

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.479
Caption: the other

00:24:58.589 --> 00:25:01.919
Caption: normally you would use some correlation

00:25:00.479 --> 00:25:03.599
Caption: idea or something to track all the

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.420
Caption: messages to see what&#39;s happening in real

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:09.178
Caption: time application profiling to make sure

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:11.970
Caption: that the verification is doing what you

00:25:09.178 --> 00:25:13.659
Caption: want it to to do what you expecting it

00:25:11.969 --> 00:25:16.619
Caption: to do

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.619
Caption: the business continuity

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.000
Caption: now what happens if your database was

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.760
Caption: deleted

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.510
Caption: they think about that for a second let

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:28.099
Caption: that sink in like many people would not

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.810
Caption: really take that into consideration but

00:25:28.099 --> 00:25:32.030
Caption: there was a long conversation on Twitter

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:35.180
Caption: about two months ago a junior developer

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:36.260
Caption: just started in a job and the first

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.970
Caption: thing that they did they gave them a

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.949
Caption: document set up your system and they

00:25:37.969 --> 00:25:41.900
Caption: just deleted the database now for that

00:25:39.949 --> 00:25:43.939
Caption: whatever reason that that was a stupid

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.109
Caption: case and they were blaming the junior

00:25:43.939 --> 00:25:48.759
Caption: developer for it which I don&#39;t think

00:25:45.109 --> 00:25:51.559
Caption: he&#39;s liable for it but it happens um

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.599
Caption: they&#39;re even worse what happens if

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.630
Caption: you&#39;re a juror account or AWS account

00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:58.890
Caption: was deleted

00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:00.729
Caption: um and then you take that further how

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:03.880
Caption: consistence are your build and your

00:26:00.729 --> 00:26:04.989
Caption: configurations and ultimately the

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.810
Caption: question is really here that we&#39;re

00:26:04.989 --> 00:26:09.400
Caption: trying to get into you how hard is it

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:12.340
Caption: going to be how long is it gonna take

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:14.109
Caption: you to get back online now if you are a

00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:16.179
Caption: developer you better be in a deep

00:26:14.109 --> 00:26:18.479
Caption: but if you are and sorry for the

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:20.369
Caption: expression but if you are an architect

00:26:18.479 --> 00:26:23.109
Caption: you&#39;re going to lose your job and

00:26:20.369 --> 00:26:24.160
Caption: probably going to be even liable because

00:26:23.109 --> 00:26:26.589
Caption: you are accountable from the

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.479
Caption: organization that&#39;s entrusted in you you

00:26:26.589 --> 00:26:31.239
Caption: are liable that to make sure that the

00:26:28.479 --> 00:26:33.040
Caption: system is available and these are your

00:26:31.239 --> 00:26:35.429
Caption: decisions that&#39;s going to make the

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.430
Caption: impact

00:26:37.189 --> 00:26:43.339
Caption: a couple of thing last year I was doing

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:49.489
Caption: a contracting gig for a mining company

00:26:43.339 --> 00:26:51.229
Caption: in in Melbourne and we built this simple

00:26:49.489 --> 00:26:53.689
Caption: application we went with pass offering

00:26:51.229 --> 00:26:56.209
Caption: go and edger towards the end of the

00:26:53.689 --> 00:26:58.519
Caption: project they said we have this risk

00:26:56.209 --> 00:26:59.839
Caption: matrix that we want to meet and we want

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.339
Caption: to make sure that if as your goes down

00:26:59.839 --> 00:27:03.558
Caption: we are still able to function so they

00:27:01.339 --> 00:27:06.678
Caption: wanted to have

00:27:03.558 --> 00:27:08.268
Caption: a backup on AWS and I was thinking like

00:27:06.678 --> 00:27:10.699
Caption: why do you have to complicate things

00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:12.429
Caption: Ezio gives you 99 point something so

00:27:10.699 --> 00:27:15.079
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s probably going to be cool

00:27:12.428 --> 00:27:18.829
Caption: the next day as your goes down for one

00:27:15.079 --> 00:27:20.479
Caption: and a half hour anyways it was really

00:27:18.829 --> 00:27:21.949
Caption: terrible I got pulled into a meeting and

00:27:20.479 --> 00:27:24.558
Caption: I had to explain to the city what

00:27:21.949 --> 00:27:26.959
Caption: decisions I have made obviously I was

00:27:24.558 --> 00:27:29.268
Caption: close to losing my job luckily I was

00:27:26.959 --> 00:27:31.298
Caption: able to survive from that but it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:33.529
Caption: really a lesson that we need to learn um

00:27:31.298 --> 00:27:34.548
Caption: you need to think about these before

00:27:33.529 --> 00:27:37.059
Caption: they happen so that you can prepare

00:27:34.548 --> 00:27:37.058
Caption: yourself

00:27:37.319 --> 00:27:40.979
Caption: lastly governance how do we make sure

00:27:39.209 --> 00:27:42.569
Caption: that the architecture that we&#39;re putting

00:27:40.979 --> 00:27:44.459
Caption: today is still going to be relevant and

00:27:42.569 --> 00:27:48.859
Caption: we&#39;re still going to be able to use and

00:27:44.459 --> 00:27:52.289
Caption: comply with it in the time to come so

00:27:48.859 --> 00:27:53.939
Caption: this is really more about it there are

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:57.989
Caption: there are two folds for it that I see

00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:59.879
Caption: one fold which is defining the rules and

00:27:57.989 --> 00:28:02.880
Caption: getting the buy-in from from the people

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.290
Caption: in your team so defining to everybody

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.790
Caption: what&#39;s the style of architecture that

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.859
Caption: you using whether you&#39;re using event

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:10.470
Caption: sourcing whether using CQRS over there

00:28:07.859 --> 00:28:11.760
Caption: using anything else that you want to

00:28:10.469 --> 00:28:13.199
Caption: make sure that everybody understands

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.609
Caption: what style of architecture that you&#39;re

00:28:13.199 --> 00:28:18.359
Caption: getting to what patterns are you heading

00:28:14.609 --> 00:28:21.989
Caption: to and then the the second fold is using

00:28:18.359 --> 00:28:24.890
Caption: those really tools to enforce that there

00:28:21.989 --> 00:28:24.890
Caption: are great tools by

00:28:25.699 --> 00:28:32.750
Caption: a guy called Andrew best from Sydney is

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:34.580
Caption: a I think a ratify consultant I really

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:38.530
Caption: love these tools Taylor for example

00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:40.699
Caption: gives you the ability to enforce your

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:43.250
Caption: assumptions or requirements so if your

00:28:40.699 --> 00:28:45.019
Caption: database query is taking longer than X

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:47.530
Caption: amount of time you have tests that&#39;s

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:49.310
Caption: going to fail in your CI CD and

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.580
Caption: developers are not going to be able to

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:53.450
Caption: continue without fixing that or

00:28:51.579 --> 00:28:56.599
Caption: conventional for example if you are

00:28:53.449 --> 00:28:59.049
Caption: following how many people use domain

00:28:56.599 --> 00:28:59.049
Caption: driven design

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:03.580
Caption: yeah great um I think most people would

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:04.930
Caption: agree that when you start with

00:29:03.579 --> 00:29:06.849
Caption: domain-driven design it&#39;s great

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.950
Caption: everything is clean everything is tidy

00:29:06.849 --> 00:29:10.209
Caption: the more you&#39;re gonna move on the more

00:29:08.949 --> 00:29:11.589
Caption: you&#39;re gonna find that people come into

00:29:10.209 --> 00:29:12.880
Caption: the team they don&#39;t really comprehend

00:29:11.589 --> 00:29:14.949
Caption: the full concept of domain-driven design

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.780
Caption: and they will start changing things

00:29:14.949 --> 00:29:18.519
Caption: they&#39;re one one basic thing about

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:20.170
Caption: domain-driven design is that information

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.459
Caption: hiding information is not available and

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:23.050
Caption: then you put your boundaries and

00:29:21.459 --> 00:29:25.239
Caption: everything changed through methods or

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.980
Caption: contracts that you do enforce somebody

00:29:25.239 --> 00:29:28.900
Caption: would come in and then gonna make all

00:29:26.979 --> 00:29:31.929
Caption: this data available so everything has a

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.580
Caption: gate and set and all the concepts and

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:35.050
Caption: all the considerations of DDD just run

00:29:33.579 --> 00:29:37.089
Caption: out of the window so you want to make

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:39.760
Caption: sure that this is all enforced in your

00:29:37.089 --> 00:29:41.169
Caption: code and your tests and conventional is

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.940
Caption: great I&#39;m going to show you a demo in a

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:44.560
Caption: second for that so this is this is

00:29:42.939 --> 00:29:47.439
Caption: really the same in point two which is

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:50.350
Caption: executable documents non-functional

00:29:47.439 --> 00:29:54.519
Caption: requirements are must be enforced they

00:29:50.349 --> 00:29:56.859
Caption: he you are required to have a

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.420
Caption: performance time no more than five

00:29:56.859 --> 00:30:02.890
Caption: seconds then that really should be part

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:04.180
Caption: of your test so that if if your system

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.229
Caption: is taking more than five seconds then

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.580
Caption: you should you should fail the bill

00:30:05.229 --> 00:30:08.699
Caption: because it&#39;s a requirement and you&#39;re

00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:11.439
Caption: going to be able to go without it

00:30:08.699 --> 00:30:13.179
Caption: traceability this is very important if

00:30:11.439 --> 00:30:14.619
Caption: you&#39;re doing anything in health when

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.080
Caption: when I was working in health we were

00:30:14.619 --> 00:30:18.969
Caption: required to show a full traceability for

00:30:17.079 --> 00:30:21.760
Caption: every line of code where this is coming

00:30:18.969 --> 00:30:23.619
Caption: from that we wrote this extension for

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.770
Caption: JIRA and it was taking the acceptance

00:30:23.619 --> 00:30:28.510
Caption: criteria from Chiara generating the

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:30.099
Caption: feature files and our testers were

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.079
Caption: working with the feature files just to

00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:32.829
Caption: do the automation testing so no need to

00:30:32.079 --> 00:30:34.359
Caption: worry about it

00:30:32.829 --> 00:30:36.880
Caption: manual testing it&#39;s all automated

00:30:34.359 --> 00:30:38.770
Caption: testing and then the automation testing

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.569
Caption: is feeding back back basically saying

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:43.839
Caption: okay which line of code it&#39;s pointing to

00:30:40.569 --> 00:30:46.149
Caption: or which feature it&#39;s pointing to so

00:30:43.839 --> 00:30:49.000
Caption: that was really helpful and in the end

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:50.349
Caption: it&#39;s really getting the buy-in with all

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.569
Caption: the technology if you don&#39;t have the

00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:54.400
Caption: buy-in people are not really happy to

00:30:52.569 --> 00:30:56.019
Caption: contribute to it so without explaining

00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:00.130
Caption: the why for your team you&#39;re not going

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:02.880
Caption: to get anywhere all right so we have the

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.880
Caption: second demo

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.060
Caption: you

00:31:05.808 --> 00:31:08.888
Caption: can you see this

00:31:09.869 --> 00:31:14.209
Caption: now this is a standard

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:15.859
Caption: aggregate if anybody used DDD you would

00:31:14.209 --> 00:31:17.989
Caption: you would find this relevant so you have

00:31:15.859 --> 00:31:20.109
Caption: the aggregate root here can you read

00:31:17.989 --> 00:31:20.109
Caption: this

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:30.949
Caption: yeah okay so basically it&#39;s saying that

00:31:26.869 --> 00:31:32.808
Caption: I need to have protected default

00:31:30.949 --> 00:31:34.699
Caption: constructor for my Intel frameworks so

00:31:32.808 --> 00:31:39.829
Caption: that can use that for serializing

00:31:34.699 --> 00:31:42.229
Caption: my object it I need to have constructors

00:31:39.829 --> 00:31:47.029
Caption: for factory methods to generate those

00:31:42.229 --> 00:31:48.890
Caption: and all my properties need to be

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:51.049
Caption: protected so I need to have only private

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.890
Caption: sets so this is what we were talking

00:31:51.048 --> 00:31:55.069
Caption: about it now

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:57.260
Caption: a year or two years later down the track

00:31:55.069 --> 00:31:58.609
Caption: you get somebody just coming and joining

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.589
Caption: the team they don&#39;t really have full

00:31:58.609 --> 00:32:04.040
Caption: comprehension of the LED that they go

00:32:00.589 --> 00:32:06.520
Caption: and add a method and they say for

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.520
Caption: example

00:32:10.869 --> 00:32:14.069
Caption: I&#39;m going to add

00:32:16.109 --> 00:32:21.839
Caption: now I&#39;m having a public set here this is

00:32:20.099 --> 00:32:23.548
Caption: throwing Dedede concepts out of the

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:25.859
Caption: window because you&#39;re really not having

00:32:23.548 --> 00:32:28.558
Caption: any way of enforcing how these fields

00:32:25.859 --> 00:32:33.630
Caption: are going to change so now if I if I run

00:32:28.558 --> 00:32:36.268
Caption: my test here you&#39;re going to see that my

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:38.880
Caption: test is going to fail and this is really

00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:40.500
Caption: great not only for enforcing the design

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.349
Caption: concept that you have embodied in your

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:45.390
Caption: in your code but it&#39;s also important for

00:32:43.349 --> 00:32:46.739
Caption: shortening that feedback loop there

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:48.869
Caption: normally what would happen with a

00:32:46.739 --> 00:32:50.609
Caption: scenario like this is that somebody is

00:32:48.869 --> 00:32:52.260
Caption: going to add this this code we&#39;re going

00:32:50.609 --> 00:32:53.788
Caption: to push it in it&#39;s going to come to you

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.558
Caption: whether you are technically there the

00:32:53.788 --> 00:32:57.329
Caption: solution architects you&#39;re going to live

00:32:55.558 --> 00:32:58.739
Caption: review it and you&#39;re going to say nope

00:32:57.329 --> 00:33:01.199
Caption: rejected you&#39;re going to need to look at

00:32:58.739 --> 00:33:02.639
Caption: this but this is taking so much time

00:33:01.199 --> 00:33:04.229
Caption: it&#39;s taking time from you as the

00:33:02.639 --> 00:33:05.970
Caption: architect or technical aid as well as

00:33:04.229 --> 00:33:07.558
Caption: the developer if you have something like

00:33:05.969 --> 00:33:10.288
Caption: this that&#39;s automating it it&#39;s going to

00:33:07.558 --> 00:33:11.819
Caption: you gonna speed things up and make

00:33:10.288 --> 00:33:13.739
Caption: things easier for yourself and for Pete

00:33:11.819 --> 00:33:16.138
Caption: for other people if we look at that the

00:33:13.739 --> 00:33:19.048
Caption: test that we have here all we&#39;re doing

00:33:16.139 --> 00:33:20.580
Caption: really is using refer arm reflection

00:33:19.048 --> 00:33:22.288
Caption: we&#39;re just loading all the aggregate

00:33:20.579 --> 00:33:25.439
Caption: fruits and we&#39;re just saying okay all

00:33:22.288 --> 00:33:28.288
Caption: rule all aggregates and must conform

00:33:25.439 --> 00:33:30.209
Caption: into this standard or this style and

00:33:28.288 --> 00:33:31.888
Caption: there are so many of these standards and

00:33:30.209 --> 00:33:34.619
Caption: styles that are available for you and

00:33:31.889 --> 00:33:37.559
Caption: they are all built using grossly so you

00:33:34.619 --> 00:33:39.359
Caption: could extend them if you want to I find

00:33:37.558 --> 00:33:42.089
Caption: it really an interesting tool and I use

00:33:39.359 --> 00:33:45.408
Caption: it a lot I hope you you find and there

00:33:42.089 --> 00:33:47.489
Caption: are other sorry there are a lot of other

00:33:45.409 --> 00:33:49.889
Caption: things as well like for example if

00:33:47.489 --> 00:33:52.619
Caption: somebody is using day time though now

00:33:49.889 --> 00:33:54.179
Caption: for example how many people use that but

00:33:52.619 --> 00:33:55.889
Caption: then it makes things really hard to test

00:33:54.178 --> 00:33:57.148
Caption: it makes it really things really hard to

00:33:55.889 --> 00:33:59.159
Caption: predict and you don&#39;t know when it&#39;s

00:33:57.149 --> 00:34:00.330
Caption: going to just blow up in runtime so you

00:33:59.159 --> 00:34:03.110
Caption: want to make sure that these kinds of

00:34:00.329 --> 00:34:03.109
Caption: things are enforced

00:34:03.369 --> 00:34:06.599
Caption: they&#39;re going back there

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.979
Caption: okay so we looked at that so I hope it

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:18.360
Caption: wasn&#39;t very fluffy I hope you find that

00:34:14.979 --> 00:34:20.590
Caption: there was something useful in there and

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:23.470
Caption: again if there was anything that I would

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:26.350
Caption: want you to take away from this if you

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:29.409
Caption: reaching into something that you haven&#39;t

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:31.960
Caption: done before give yourself enough time to

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:33.969
Caption: think about it normally I give myself at

00:34:31.959 --> 00:34:36.099
Caption: least three hours of just reading with

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:40.270
Caption: an open mind before I try to make any

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:42.190
Caption: decision and if I haven&#39;t really used it

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:43.689
Caption: at least in a side-project and proof of

00:34:42.189 --> 00:34:46.089
Caption: concept I wouldn&#39;t be able to use it for

00:34:43.689 --> 00:34:48.040
Caption: a prediction it&#39;s just I&#39;m not really

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:49.550
Caption: qualified enough to you to go and use

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:53.900
Caption: that

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:56.060
Caption: and that&#39;s really all any questions I

00:34:53.899 --> 00:34:59.649
Caption: have two small things here to give away

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.650
Caption: if anybody has any questions

00:35:01.439 --> 00:35:04.979
Caption: now

00:35:02.919 --> 00:35:04.979
Caption: you

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:16.190
Caption: true I try to make sure that

00:35:14.419 --> 00:35:18.229
Caption: obviously you got to understand I&#39;ve

00:35:16.189 --> 00:35:22.879
Caption: only been a solution architect for a

00:35:18.229 --> 00:35:24.169
Caption: short time so but my way is always

00:35:22.879 --> 00:35:28.250
Caption: trying to make sure that I&#39;m working

00:35:24.169 --> 00:35:30.199
Caption: with all stakeholders so being the

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:33.069
Caption: developers the enterprise architects or

00:35:30.199 --> 00:35:37.848
Caption: the security teams the operations team

00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:41.160
Caption: what I have seen normally the case in my

00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:43.530
Caption: consulting career is that

00:35:41.159 --> 00:35:45.719
Caption: companies tend to or teens tend to leave

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:47.250
Caption: things until the last minute and

00:35:45.719 --> 00:35:49.830
Caption: especially when it comes into security

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:51.899
Caption: or operations and that tend to create

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:53.280
Caption: big gaps or create scope creeps toward

00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:54.869
Caption: the end of the project and everybody

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.000
Caption: would become unhappy so I try to make

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.800
Caption: sure that I engage people as as early on

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.610
Caption: as possible that&#39;s that&#39;s my only

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.090
Caption: approach

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:03.090
Caption: yep

00:36:07.118 --> 00:36:09.179
Caption: you

00:36:14.599 --> 00:36:23.319
Caption: a lot so when I when I moved into this

00:36:18.949 --> 00:36:25.999
Caption: role I was interviewing for three roles

00:36:23.319 --> 00:36:30.849
Caption: - all of them they wanted the solution

00:36:25.999 --> 00:36:35.659
Caption: architect that is not really coding and

00:36:30.849 --> 00:36:35.930
Caption: I didn&#39;t want to be rude so I said yeah

00:36:35.659 --> 00:36:38.328
Caption: sure

00:36:35.929 --> 00:36:41.328
Caption: but I didn&#39;t really want to progress

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:43.489
Caption: because I wanted to make sure that an

00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:44.960
Caption: architect is still coding if I&#39;m not

00:36:43.489 --> 00:36:47.179
Caption: coding I&#39;m not going to be able to feel

00:36:44.959 --> 00:36:49.179
Caption: the pain or get the right feedback that

00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:51.348
Caption: developers that they are giving me and

00:36:49.179 --> 00:36:53.838
Caption: that&#39;s why I went with the with the

00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:57.529
Caption: current role so normally you will find

00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:59.150
Caption: me at least doing I try to say 10 to 30%

00:36:57.529 --> 00:37:01.549
Caption: recording sometimes that doesn&#39;t happen

00:36:59.149 --> 00:37:05.108
Caption: but I try to stay as close as possible

00:37:01.549 --> 00:37:05.109
Caption: to to the development team

00:37:05.739 --> 00:37:07.979
Caption: yeah

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:13.489
Caption: you

00:37:18.989 --> 00:37:21.050
Caption: you

00:37:35.949 --> 00:37:43.149
Caption: um so the question is how how hard it is

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:45.910
Caption: to learn or how much time you it would

00:37:43.149 --> 00:37:47.349
Caption: take you to learn the domain of the new

00:37:45.909 --> 00:37:50.319
Caption: organization of the processes of the new

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:53.470
Caption: organization now I think what helped me

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.870
Caption: was for the last three or four years I

00:37:53.469 --> 00:37:59.800
Caption: was working as a consultant so I have

00:37:55.870 --> 00:38:01.240
Caption: had gigs that lasted a week and I was

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.370
Caption: under the pump to deliver something in

00:38:01.239 --> 00:38:06.280
Caption: the end of a week and I had gigs that

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:09.820
Caption: lasted three or four months so that

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:11.350
Caption: helped me a lot set me up for being able

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.630
Caption: to switch context and go into different

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:16.390
Caption: organizations and get projected as quick

00:38:13.629 --> 00:38:17.559
Caption: as possible but it&#39;s also about making

00:38:16.389 --> 00:38:18.969
Caption: sure that when you&#39;re getting into the

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.989
Caption: organisation&#39;s you are connecting with

00:38:18.969 --> 00:38:22.469
Caption: the right people and getting the

00:38:19.989 --> 00:38:22.469
Caption: information

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:27.060
Caption: in many scenarios I found it really hard

00:38:25.679 --> 00:38:28.319
Caption: to get the right information the

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:31.410
Caption: information is there but just nobody

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.209
Caption: knows where it is and it&#39;s just part of

00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:35.219
Caption: the game that you just can have to dig

00:38:33.209 --> 00:38:36.750
Caption: that in and talk to the right people try

00:38:35.219 --> 00:38:40.010
Caption: to tell people and people going to lead

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:40.010
Caption: you into other people to ask

00:38:40.539 --> 00:38:42.809
Caption: yeah

00:38:47.419 --> 00:38:53.338
Caption: yes so I talked about it making sure

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:55.020
Caption: that I&#39;m reading enough for it that&#39;s

00:38:53.339 --> 00:38:58.020
Caption: that&#39;s a really key element for me and I

00:38:55.020 --> 00:39:00.780
Caption: found that really helped me a lot but

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:02.669
Caption: normally if we are trying to introduce

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:05.250
Caption: new technology we need to have an

00:39:02.669 --> 00:39:06.510
Caption: agreement and the developer that&#39;s

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:08.520
Caption: introducing or the team that&#39;s

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:10.979
Caption: introducing this this new technology or

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:13.290
Caption: framework and and myself or whoever else

00:39:10.979 --> 00:39:15.889
Caption: is involved need to have that agreement

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:17.900
Caption: now normally

00:39:15.889 --> 00:39:19.338
Caption: as technologists really we are very

00:39:17.899 --> 00:39:21.768
Caption: passionate about new technology and I

00:39:19.339 --> 00:39:23.410
Caption: myself included I love when I hear about

00:39:21.769 --> 00:39:25.969
Caption: a new framework and I just want to get

00:39:23.409 --> 00:39:27.588
Caption: started into coding and using it but

00:39:25.969 --> 00:39:29.419
Caption: then you want to make sure that you are

00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:30.920
Caption: addressing the risk because every

00:39:29.419 --> 00:39:33.439
Caption: technology that you are adding it&#39;s a

00:39:30.919 --> 00:39:36.108
Caption: risk do you have the right tools do you

00:39:33.439 --> 00:39:38.088
Caption: have the right people the skill set to

00:39:36.108 --> 00:39:41.318
Caption: be able to end productive with it so

00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:41.319
Caption: normally I try to have

00:39:41.409 --> 00:39:45.219
Caption: it&#39;s kind of like a checklist making

00:39:43.209 --> 00:39:47.349
Caption: sure that do we have something that does

00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:48.969
Caption: that and are there gaps with the one

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:50.560
Caption: that the tool or framework that we&#39;re

00:39:48.969 --> 00:39:52.510
Caption: using is there a justification for

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.310
Caption: introducing this tool if there is sure

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:56.439
Caption: let&#39;s use it but let&#39;s understand

00:39:54.310 --> 00:40:00.400
Caption: whether there are any other tools and in

00:39:56.439 --> 00:40:02.770
Caption: many instances that I have seen there

00:40:00.399 --> 00:40:04.659
Caption: are tools that there are there um there

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:07.719
Caption: was I give you an example I think it was

00:40:04.659 --> 00:40:09.189
Caption: last year we&#39;re using spec for and I

00:40:07.719 --> 00:40:12.820
Caption: don&#39;t know how many people use spec for

00:40:09.189 --> 00:40:14.649
Caption: it&#39;s great for Auto mocking so if you

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.180
Caption: are doing testing somebody&#39;s gonna

00:40:14.649 --> 00:40:19.209
Caption: disagree with me here but if you&#39;re

00:40:16.179 --> 00:40:21.159
Caption: doing unit testing and you want to you

00:40:19.209 --> 00:40:22.300
Caption: oughta mock certain elements if you

00:40:21.159 --> 00:40:23.439
Caption: don&#39;t want to focus on this you want to

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.630
Caption: focus on the piece that you are working

00:40:23.439 --> 00:40:27.459
Caption: with we&#39;re using spec 4 which was great

00:40:25.629 --> 00:40:31.419
Caption: for that a developer came to me and he

00:40:27.459 --> 00:40:32.739
Caption: said I&#39;m going to use auto fixture why

00:40:31.419 --> 00:40:35.099
Caption: do you want to use auto fixture because

00:40:32.739 --> 00:40:37.290
Caption: auto mocking doesn&#39;t do this and that

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:39.220
Caption: okay so let&#39;s look at the documentation

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:40.390
Caption: looking at the documentation for about

00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:42.849
Caption: them and it solved the problem that he

00:40:40.389 --> 00:40:45.309
Caption: was trying to you have by introducing

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:46.780
Caption: this new technology and there is nothing

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:48.670
Caption: wrong with introducing new technology

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:50.229
Caption: but as long as we have the right reason

00:40:48.669 --> 00:40:51.939
Caption: for it great let&#39;s go for it

00:40:50.229 --> 00:40:53.609
Caption: but sometimes just asking the right

00:40:51.939 --> 00:40:56.229
Caption: questions you&#39;re gonna find whether

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:58.630
Caption: there is a real need for it or whether

00:40:56.229 --> 00:41:00.330
Caption: there is not I hope that answered your

00:40:58.629 --> 00:41:03.589
Caption: question

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:03.590
Caption: any other clothes yes

00:41:07.709 --> 00:41:09.770
Caption: you

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.550
Caption: I

00:41:27.199 --> 00:41:34.280
Caption: now at the moment I&#39;m actually permanent

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:36.170
Caption: it&#39;s interesting if you look at my

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.719
Caption: profile I haven&#39;t stayed in a place for

00:41:36.169 --> 00:41:41.829
Caption: more than a year and a half I&#39;ve moved a

00:41:38.719 --> 00:41:44.060
Caption: lot and I think that helped me a lot in

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:45.560
Caption: being the person I am learning a lot

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.550
Caption: about other domains and learning about

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.580
Caption: how other companies are doing things

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:53.010
Caption: [Music]

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:54.750
Caption: but in going into an interval into an

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:56.550
Caption: architectural you&#39;re gonna you&#39;re gonna

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:59.459
Caption: need to have some long-term engagement

00:41:56.550 --> 00:42:01.530
Caption: but I found it interesting that many

00:41:59.459 --> 00:42:04.199
Caption: companies are willing to take somebody

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:07.830
Caption: for an architectural for six months or a

00:42:04.199 --> 00:42:10.800
Caption: year at the moment I&#39;m currently on a

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:12.540
Caption: permanent phase but

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.890
Caption: I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m still weighing my

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.510
Caption: options I&#39;ll be very honest with you I

00:42:13.889 --> 00:42:17.219
Caption: haven&#39;t really made a decision I&#39;m still

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:19.439
Caption: thinking whether I should go back into

00:42:17.219 --> 00:42:21.770
Caption: just being a developer because I think I

00:42:19.439 --> 00:42:23.729
Caption: enjoy my time more yes

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:24.870
Caption: focusing on the technical side rather

00:42:23.729 --> 00:42:28.020
Caption: than focusing going stakeholder

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:29.700
Caption: management I&#39;m still trying to work out

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.800
Caption: my decision but I was looking and there

00:42:29.699 --> 00:42:33.869
Caption: are so many jobs even Enterprise

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.580
Caption: architects which is like more strategic

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:37.890
Caption: and more visionary kind of role in the

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:40.050
Caption: enterprise and there are contracts for

00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:41.339
Caption: six months or one year if I wanted to do

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:43.910
Caption: that or if somebody want to do that you

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.910
Caption: can still do that

00:42:44.699 --> 00:42:47.899
Caption: right yeah

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.080
Caption: you

00:43:01.739 --> 00:43:03.800
Caption: you

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:14.420
Caption: there is there is for obviously there is

00:43:13.159 --> 00:43:16.309
Caption: probably more legacy code in the

00:43:14.419 --> 00:43:18.199
Caption: industry than Greenfield at the moment

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:19.850
Caption: because there are so many new concepts

00:43:18.199 --> 00:43:23.689
Caption: coming up whether it&#39;s virtual reality

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:25.310
Caption: IOT machine learning artificial

00:43:23.689 --> 00:43:26.719
Caption: intelligence so there are a lot of new

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:28.489
Caption: development going up so there is more

00:43:26.719 --> 00:43:30.560
Caption: greenfield but there is a lot more

00:43:28.489 --> 00:43:33.080
Caption: legacy code as well

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.580
Caption: I have done a lot of legacy engagements

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.410
Caption: myself so the engagement that I was

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:39.770
Caption: talking about for one week that was

00:43:36.409 --> 00:43:41.299
Caption: actually for a utility company down in

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:44.149
Caption: Melbourne where they had a contract with

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:47.420
Caption: the Defense Department and something

00:43:44.149 --> 00:43:48.949
Caption: wasn&#39;t working and it hit the fan that

00:43:47.419 --> 00:43:50.719
Caption: Defense Department told them okay we

00:43:48.949 --> 00:43:52.760
Caption: gonna cancel your contract so they got

00:43:50.719 --> 00:43:54.109
Caption: me in and they told me okay you&#39;re gonna

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.969
Caption: need to find this it was an Android

00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:57.530
Caption: application connecting to the cloud and

00:43:55.969 --> 00:44:00.560
Caption: it was just timing out and was in

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:03.020
Caption: logging them off so my engagement was

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:05.330
Caption: just to make sure that what&#39;s the

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.890
Caption: problem find the problem first and the

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:08.360
Caption: first week was just really just finding

00:44:06.889 --> 00:44:11.359
Caption: the problem and I found out the problem

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:14.150
Caption: the first three days I think and then

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:16.330
Caption: after that we went into the second phase

00:44:14.149 --> 00:44:18.919
Caption: which took about the other name probably

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:20.570
Caption: two or three weeks for them to go

00:44:18.919 --> 00:44:22.909
Caption: through the process and sign the

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:26.239
Caption: purchase order with more and then we put

00:44:22.909 --> 00:44:27.500
Caption: a fix for it so I&#39;ve done legacy code as

00:44:26.239 --> 00:44:28.520
Caption: well and there is more legacy code

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.469
Caption: actually especially if you go into

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:33.550
Caption: finest Institute there is more legacy

00:44:30.469 --> 00:44:33.550
Caption: than then greenfield development

00:44:39.608 --> 00:44:44.239
Caption: it depends on the organization and the

00:44:42.169 --> 00:44:48.409
Caption: role that you want to play it is an

00:44:44.239 --> 00:44:50.270
Caption: advisory role and they I don&#39;t really

00:44:48.409 --> 00:44:51.559
Caption: like to be an advisory so I want to make

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:53.359
Caption: sure that I get my hands dirty and

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.920
Caption: that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying I went into the

00:44:53.358 --> 00:44:58.098
Caption: third role rather than the first two

00:44:54.919 --> 00:44:59.719
Caption: roles so it&#39;s really depends on you and

00:44:58.099 --> 00:45:03.290
Caption: the role the organization that you&#39;re

00:44:59.719 --> 00:45:05.449
Caption: going to like I said the first two

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:07.280
Caption: questions the people that asked very I

00:45:05.449 --> 00:45:09.260
Caption: don&#39;t know your name said your gifts are

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:13.908
Caption: here Thanks thanks everybody

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.908
Caption: [Applause]
