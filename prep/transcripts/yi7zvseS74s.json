  "description": "To deal with uncertainty, you have to design your software to be resilient. This session will review the most useful patterns for building resilient applications such as graceful degradation, timeouts, exponential back-off, and circuit breakers. It will also explore how we can test our assumptions by injecting failure into our applications and uncovering our weaknesses. You will leave with an understanding of how to build more resilient applications and several patterns that you can apply to your software development projects.\\n\\nMostly intermediate\\n45 mins\\nBackend Development\\nDeveloper with a passion for building software of all shapes and sizes on any conceivable platform."
