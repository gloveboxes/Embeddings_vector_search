  "description": "Have you ever looked at an NFT and wondered why they sell for outrageous sums of money? \\n\\nLooking closer at the blockchain, have you wondered how a write-only database is better than what you currently use? \\n\\nWhen bombarded with marketing and other developers telling you Web3 is the future, do you find that the bad parts get glossed over with a hand wave?\\n\\nJoin me as we pull apart these rose tinted glasses of the Web3 future and look at the damage it causes.\\n\\nLearn about the pitfalls of Web3, Blockchain and Crypto. Learn how to see past the distorted dreams of the Web3 crowd. Most importantly, gain a reflection on the impact the systems we build can have. \\n\\nNo experience necessary\\n45 mins\\nCore/Non Technical Skills\\nI am the co-founder and CTO at ClimateClever, a startup helping schools, homes, and businesses track, reduce, and report their carbon footprint. \\n\\nA full-stack developer with over ten years of experience, I have previously run an App development agency, managing various teams from design and marketing to web and native mobile app developers both in Australia and abroad, and overseen the development of many projects. \\n\\nMy strengths are in system architecture design and being able to communicate complicated tech to everyday people. I have helped scale numerous startups, and I am passionate about making a positive difference. \\n\\nWhen I am not working, you can find me writing new articles about being a programmer, from opinion pieces to tutorials. I regularly talk on various topics, my latest: microservices at Latency Conf 2021 and a TEDx talk on privacy and data.\\n\\nI am devastated by the state of the world, love a good political rant and can often be found swearing at no one in particular. I love Node, Deno, React, Svelte, MongoDB and a little bit of Rust."
