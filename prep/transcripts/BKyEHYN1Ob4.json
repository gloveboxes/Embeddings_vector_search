  "description": "Functional programming is becoming increasingly important as we build more complex systems and use more parallel and concurrent programming.  It\u2019s also now present and being used more in mainstream languages like Java, C#, Swift and Javascript so it can no-longer be ignored by developers.  \\n\\nHave you tried to understand functional programming but been completely bamboozled?  Or do you know what a function is and understand the basics of functional programming but wonder what\u2019s with all the other stuff?  It\u2019s most likely the big picture hasn\u2019t been explained, or at least not clearly enough.\\n\\nThis talk will give you a clear conceptual overview of functional programming with simple examples so that you will really get what it\u2019s all about.  There are consequences of only using functions and this is what makes functional programming very different from other programming paradigms.   \\n\\nThis talk won\u2019t use terms like functor, applicative, or monad but by the end of the talk you will definitely understand them.  It also won\u2019t make you a functional programmer overnight but it will give you a conceptual framework to know what you need to do and why when doing functional programming.  \\n\\nThe presenter has more than twenty years experience explaining complex technical concepts in clear and simple terms.  \\n\\n(* not really but you\u2019ll certainly get your money\u2019s worth and more)"
