Caption: universe and today we&#39;re going to talk

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:17.440
Caption: to you about product ownership and what

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.198
Caption: is it but before we get started we just

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.720
Caption: want to take a moment to celebrate how

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:22.879
Caption: wonderful it is that we get to stand

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:24.399
Caption: here in burulu and we want to pay our

Caption: contributions to the land that we&#39;re on

Caption: we also want to take a moment to

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:36.159
Caption: actually thank our sponsors because

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.000
Caption: without whom

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.680
Caption: ddd wouldn&#39;t happen

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.840
Caption: and big shout out to journey one as well

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.599
Caption: for believing in us thank you very

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.879
Caption: much all right so let&#39;s get started so

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:50.718
Caption: as i mentioned i&#39;m going to avoid and my

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.559
Caption: history really started around about 15

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.719
Caption: years ago i started working in digital

00:00:52.558 --> 00:00:56.238
Caption: and the technology

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.559
Caption: technology space i was always going to

00:00:56.238 --> 00:01:00.718
Caption: have a little bit of a blooper um so i

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:02.959
Caption: started there about 15 years ago and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.360
Caption: probably 2012 was when i first got

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:07.199
Caption: exposed to the role of a product owner

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.158
Caption: and since then i&#39;ve been on the path of

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:12.399
Caption: discovery of what that actually means

00:01:10.158 --> 00:01:14.879
Caption: hey everyone i am aish srinivas as we

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.200
Caption: mentioned earlier as well so contrary to

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:18.399
Caption: donna&#39;s decade of experience or so i&#39;ve

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:20.079
Caption: only been figuring out what it means to

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.319
Caption: be a product owner for the last 10

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.680
Caption: months give or take i&#39;m really

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.839
Caption: passionate about the intersection

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.720
Caption: between business technology and social

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:28.798
Caption: impact

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.799
Caption: um but i&#39;ve become more and more curious

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.240
Caption: about the product owner role and how

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.759
Caption: pivotal it can actually be in the

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:37.519
Caption: success or otherwise of a project

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.159
Caption: so we&#39;d just like to call out that we&#39;re

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:42.000
Caption: not superheroes in this space but we are

00:01:40.158 --> 00:01:43.599
Caption: super curious

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.559
Caption: absolutely

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:49.040
Caption: so true product ownership style uh what

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:50.639
Caption: we&#39;ve done is really kind of collected

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.639
Caption: some research to understand what are the

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:54.478
Caption: common questions so some of the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:56.239
Caption: questions and some of the challenges

00:01:54.478 --> 00:01:58.798
Caption: that people have are do we know what it

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:00.639
Caption: means is it something that we want to be

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.200
Caption: how do we get there

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:04.639
Caption: yes so that&#39;s where we started

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:06.000
Caption: we also understood that these are some

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:07.279
Caption: of the challenges that we want to be

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.119
Caption: able to address some of the problems

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:11.119
Caption: we&#39;d like to tackle in our conversation

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.480
Caption: here about what what the value of a

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.919
Caption: product owner actually is and how

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.839
Caption: sometimes it can be undervalued at

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.759
Caption: organizations and we want to be able to

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:19.598
Caption: understand how we can achieve the

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.839
Caption: outcomes that our customers love with a

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:23.279
Caption: true product

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.878
Caption: owner so really that links through to

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.080
Caption: our vision so every product owner should

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:27.919
Caption: have one

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.400
Caption: our vision is that this talk will help

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:32.399
Caption: you understand what product owner is at

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:35.039
Caption: its core and how to navigate some of the

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:36.878
Caption: challenges in both being one and working

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:38.878
Caption: with one so if you&#39;re one of the nice

00:02:36.878 --> 00:02:40.720
Caption: people that voted for this talk uh what

00:02:38.878 --> 00:02:44.399
Caption: we&#39;ve just shared with you is the actual

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.399
Caption: brief that we submitted for this talk

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.319
Caption: ah before we move on has anybody here

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:53.279
Caption: worked in agile before

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.679
Caption: talk right um has anybody here seen a

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.639
Caption: backlog before

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.079
Caption: cool

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.399
Caption: just two of us then

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.680
Caption: has anyone here seen a user story

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.518
Caption: yes great

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:05.598
Caption: so if you have seen one you might have

00:03:03.518 --> 00:03:08.080
Caption: seen one that looks a little bit like

00:03:05.598 --> 00:03:10.000
Caption: this so in the interest of behaving like

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.639
Caption: product owners we actually turned this

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.039
Caption: talk into a user story which every

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.559
Caption: backlog item should hopefully have

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:19.039
Caption: and we wanted to think about it from the

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:21.279
Caption: perspective of our users which are you

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:23.598
Caption: so as a ddd attendee i want to

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:25.679
Caption: understand more about product ownership

00:03:23.598 --> 00:03:27.839
Caption: and what it is so that i can understand

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:29.359
Caption: why they are valuable and if i want to

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:30.639
Caption: be one

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.238
Caption: let&#39;s go through some of the acceptance

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.919
Caption: criteria that we&#39;ve written with you as

00:03:32.238 --> 00:03:35.279
Caption: our users in mind

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.039
Caption: we hope that you&#39;d be able to walk out

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.639
Caption: of this with an understanding of agile

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:40.238
Caption: and where the product owner role came

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.279
Caption: from

00:03:40.238 --> 00:03:42.878
Caption: we hope that you&#39;ll be able to

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.958
Caption: understand some common challenges with

00:03:42.878 --> 00:03:48.399
Caption: the role whether that is being a product

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:49.919
Caption: owner or working with one

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.839
Caption: we hope that we&#39;ll be able to understand

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.878
Caption: some common anti-patterns and actually

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:54.878
Caption: what an anti-pattern is

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:58.399
Caption: you hope that you&#39;re able to understand

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:00.479
Caption: different stakeholder types that you

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:01.839
Caption: might come across as a product owner and

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.279
Caption: give you some tips on how you might deal

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:04.798
Caption: with them it&#39;s probably the most fun

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.878
Caption: part i think so

00:04:04.798 --> 00:04:08.639
Caption: i&#39;m looking forward to it and finally an

00:04:06.878 --> 00:04:09.839
Caption: idea and how to get started if after all

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.360
Caption: of this you actually really want to be a

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:13.360
Caption: product owner

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.199
Caption: so with that in mind i&#39;m going gonna try

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.479
Caption: to give you a five minute rundown in

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.000
Caption: agile so

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.119
Caption: do this in five minutes we&#39;re on to a

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.519
Caption: winner so let&#39;s rewind back to 1986

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:26.000
Caption: which was obviously before my time

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:28.319
Caption: the new product development game was a

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.639
Caption: report that was written and published in

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.759
Caption: the harvard business review and it was

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.520
Caption: written by hiroteka and ikejiro did i

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.399
Caption: say them right you did yes

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:40.799
Caption: and what they talked about was

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:42.320
Caption: how the change was happening in

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:43.440
Caption: technology of how people developed

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.360
Caption: products

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.360
Caption: they went to different different

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:48.959
Caption: organizations who were doing really well

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:51.039
Caption: and wanted to understand what were their

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:53.600
Caption: patterns in those teams so that they

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.040
Caption: could try and like identify them and

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.679
Caption: share them with the rest of the tech

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.600
Caption: community so what they noticed and i

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:01.600
Caption: won&#39;t go too deep into it you can google

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.199
Caption: it and you can read it it&#39;s pretty large

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.759
Caption: so the key thing that i&#39;d like to talk

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.199
Caption: about is normally it was done

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.279
Caption: sequentially so when you&#39;re rolling out

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.199
Caption: a project or a product you would do one

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:13.039
Caption: stage then you would move on to the next

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.199
Caption: stage so i think you get gather

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.880
Caption: requirements you would do the design

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.039
Caption: then you&#39;d do the test then you would

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.600
Caption: build then potentially no one would use

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.360
Caption: it uh just joking but what they noticed

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.440
Caption: was the new companies instead of

00:05:23.359 --> 00:05:27.359
Caption: operating in that kind of relay race

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.080
Caption: they actually take it took on more of a

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:32.719
Caption: rugby scrum type of format which was

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:35.039
Caption: where they had regular communication

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.559
Caption: they would pivot if things were changing

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.639
Caption: or not going so well and they would

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:41.199
Caption: learn really early on

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:44.479
Caption: what they need to change towards so

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:47.199
Caption: that&#39;s 1986

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.639
Caption: a history of agile so i don&#39;t claim to

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.959
Caption: know all of the

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.800
Caption: different methodologies in agile because

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:54.319
Caption: there&#39;s about 50.

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:56.079
Caption: what i will say when you see this is

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.800
Caption: please be kind to your agile coaches

00:05:56.079 --> 00:06:01.599
Caption: because there&#39;s a lot to know so don&#39;t

00:05:58.799 --> 00:06:03.440
Caption: over half a century worth of knowledge

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.720
Caption: don&#39;t expect them to know every single

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.199
Caption: methodology

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.639
Caption: but really we can talk about in 1970 the

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.639
Caption: common way that people delivered

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.240
Caption: products or projects was waterfall

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.520
Caption: delivery which some of you may be

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:16.799
Caption: familiar with

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:18.720
Caption: then we moved on into 1974

00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:21.359
Caption: and we talked about the concept of

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.720
Caption: adaptive uh software development now my

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:23.758
Caption: memory is not the best so i have to read

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.880
Caption: the slide

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.559
Caption: next one was 1991 rapid app development

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.239
Caption: and then one of the ones that i

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:32.079
Caption: definitely do know about

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:34.479
Caption: is scrum so let&#39;s talk a little bit

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:37.279
Caption: about scrum i won&#39;t go too much into it

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.959
Caption: but it was actually inspired by the

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:41.519
Caption: paper that we just talked about before

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:44.160
Caption: so where they mentioned the rugby scrum

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:46.319
Caption: that was actually what led jeff

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.360
Caption: sutherland and

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:52.319
Caption: ken schwartz wouldn&#39;t get the name

00:06:49.359 --> 00:06:54.638
Caption: to come up with the scrum framework

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.639
Caption: and one of the other interesting things

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:58.000
Caption: about scrum is from all the research

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.319
Caption: that i&#39;ve looked at that&#39;s when the

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.598
Caption: product owner role was born

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:05.440
Caption: so let&#39;s move on to the next one so 1996

00:07:03.598 --> 00:07:07.519
Caption: extreme programming if you&#39;ve ever heard

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.639
Caption: of a spike what i understand is it came

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:11.119
Caption: from there

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.479
Caption: and the next part that hopefully some

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:14.559
Caption: people are familiar with because

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:18.239
Caption: everyone talks about it is the agile

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:21.199
Caption: manifesto so this was done in 2001 it

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:22.239
Caption: actually turned 20 this year

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:23.679
Caption: kudos

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:25.598
Caption: it&#39;s not a new thing

00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:28.880
Caption: so let&#39;s talk a little bit about the

00:07:25.598 --> 00:07:31.440
Caption: agile manifesto has anybody seen the

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.559
Caption: agile manifesto before

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.360
Caption: cool

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:36.160
Caption: uh does anybody know what it is

00:07:35.359 --> 00:07:39.279
Caption: no

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.519
Caption: okay so it&#39;s you may have been exposed a

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:43.039
Caption: lot in organizations about frameworks

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:44.399
Caption: and you need to do all these things you

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:46.000
Caption: need to estimate you can write user

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:48.399
Caption: stories but actually that&#39;s not how

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.639
Caption: agile started out it started out as a

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:53.359
Caption: manifesto here where they talked about

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:54.960
Caption: four values and 12 principles and if you

00:07:53.359 --> 00:07:57.119
Caption: wanted to work in agile and you just

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:59.440
Caption: followed that that would be enough to

00:07:57.119 --> 00:08:00.959
Caption: make you operate in a better way

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.479
Caption: anything you want to share absolutely i

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:04.160
Caption: just want to highlight that this isn&#39;t

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:06.720
Caption: our beautiful slide design this is

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.479
Caption: actually a capture of the original agile

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.559
Caption: manifesto web page and i love that

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:12.399
Caption: they&#39;ve just left it in its original

00:08:10.559 --> 00:08:14.079
Caption: vintage state

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:17.039
Caption: yeah this was born in a two-day

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:18.799
Caption: conference in uh ski resort in utah so

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:21.119
Caption: it&#39;s been 20 years maybe

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:23.918
Caption: we had another one yeah for sure

00:08:21.119 --> 00:08:23.919
Caption: i&#39;m on board with that

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:27.919
Caption: so we&#39;ve talked a little bit we&#39;ve

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:30.319
Caption: talked quite a lot actually thank you on

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:31.839
Caption: like the history of agile and how it&#39;s

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:33.518
Caption: developed over the years the evolution

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:35.440
Caption: of it but let&#39;s talk a little bit more

00:08:33.518 --> 00:08:38.000
Caption: about what organizations are using

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.760
Caption: currently so we&#39;ve mentioned scrum

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.919
Caption: the state of agile released a report

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.239
Caption: every year and the 14th report is really

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:46.160
Caption: growing because it highlights that scrum

00:08:44.239 --> 00:08:47.039
Caption: as a methodology is the most commonly

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:48.159
Caption: used

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:49.679
Caption: project

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:51.838
Caption: project management framework used by

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:53.518
Caption: organizations and it&#39;s great because it

00:08:51.838 --> 00:08:56.159
Caption: highlights that scrum being the simplest

00:08:53.518 --> 00:08:57.599
Caption: one is so widely used it&#39;s very closely

00:08:56.159 --> 00:08:59.440
Caption: followed by scrum then which is a

00:08:57.599 --> 00:09:01.199
Caption: combination of two of the most

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.720
Caption: simple ones as well

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.559
Caption: you got a couple of hybrids that come in

00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:06.159
Caption: just behind them there and then you do

00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:09.278
Caption: have kanban and that&#39;s where that scrum

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:10.958
Caption: then comes from scrum across kanban gets

00:09:09.278 --> 00:09:12.640
Caption: you scrum band kanban is a really great

00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.159
Caption: methodology too because it doesn&#39;t

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.239
Caption: actually confine into two-week sprints

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:17.679
Caption: into deliver value and it&#39;s also widely

00:09:16.239 --> 00:09:19.440
Caption: used across different organizations

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:21.039
Caption: across different industries not just for

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.200
Caption: software development i find it&#39;s been

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:25.039
Caption: used a lot in marketing teams or even

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.799
Caption: leadership teams to just try and keep

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:29.039
Caption: people accountable and keep the work

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:30.398
Caption: moving that&#39;s it and i love this you&#39;ve

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:31.838
Caption: got a couple of others that come through

00:09:30.398 --> 00:09:33.359
Caption: but there&#39;s a couple of organizations

00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:34.958
Caption: that actually don&#39;t know

00:09:33.359 --> 00:09:36.159
Caption: what they use and it&#39;ll be interesting

00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.919
Caption: to be a fly on the wall and those are

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:39.518
Caption: kind of uh organization and project

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:41.919
Caption: planning meetings who knows what we&#39;re

00:09:39.518 --> 00:09:44.320
Caption: doing no one knows

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:46.000
Caption: but if scrum is the simple one of the

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.760
Caption: simplest methodologies to use and it&#39;s

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.200
Caption: also the most common what does a scrum

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.320
Caption: team actually look like

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.958
Caption: of course you start off with your scrum

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.799
Caption: master they are there to make the team

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:57.119
Caption: home they are there to support enable

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:59.760
Caption: and empower your team to actually do the

00:09:57.119 --> 00:10:01.200
Caption: work and build the product

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.160
Caption: you&#39;ve got a product owner which is the

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.119
Caption: focus of aquaport today but in one line

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:07.119
Caption: they&#39;re there to make sure that the

00:10:05.119 --> 00:10:09.039
Caption: product that you&#39;re building is valuable

00:10:07.119 --> 00:10:10.398
Caption: actually delivers business value

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:12.239
Caption: i think it&#39;s important to call out as

00:10:10.398 --> 00:10:14.078
Caption: well when the scrum guide was updated i

00:10:12.239 --> 00:10:16.239
Caption: think it was last year they actually

00:10:14.078 --> 00:10:18.719
Caption: made it responsible for the scrum team

00:10:16.239 --> 00:10:20.398
Caption: to be delivering value so the product

00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:21.919
Caption: owner&#39;s still leading it but you if

00:10:20.398 --> 00:10:23.919
Caption: you&#39;re in a scrum team you still have a

00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:26.000
Caption: responsibility to care about value

00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:27.518
Caption: absolutely and let&#39;s talk about the last

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.200
Caption: players that are commonly found in scrum

00:10:27.518 --> 00:10:30.559
Caption: teams you&#39;ve got your development team

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.079
Caption: they&#39;ve got a couple of roles up on the

00:10:30.559 --> 00:10:34.320
Caption: screen here you&#39;ve got your developers

00:10:32.078 --> 00:10:35.838
Caption: beers ux ui designers but it doesn&#39;t

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.760
Caption: have to be developers within a

00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:39.518
Caption: development team it&#39;s basically any

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.600
Caption: combination of role that you need to

00:10:39.518 --> 00:10:43.440
Caption: actually build your product to actually

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:45.119
Caption: do the work

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.119
Caption: it could be content it could be

00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:49.119
Caption: marketing there&#39;s like a whole different

00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:50.719
Caption: suite where people have gone and

00:10:49.119 --> 00:10:52.320
Caption: taken all the functions that they need

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:54.319
Caption: to be able to deliver a product and put

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.239
Caption: them in one team to stop that handover

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.559
Caption: absolutely it&#39;s also worth calling out

00:10:56.239 --> 00:11:00.880
Caption: the scrum guide doesn&#39;t recognize those

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:02.880
Caption: other disciplines but they do talk about

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.559
Caption: the three roles it talks about scrum

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.838
Caption: master product owner and development

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:09.760
Caption: team

00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:11.760
Caption: let&#39;s zoom in on the product owner

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.760
Caption: the product owner

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.359
Caption: the scrum product owner is accountable

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.838
Caption: for maximizing the value of a product

00:11:15.359 --> 00:11:19.760
Caption: resulting from the work of this grunting

00:11:17.838 --> 00:11:21.760
Caption: what does that actually mean how do you

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.078
Caption: see that in practice let&#39;s digest it a

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.518
Caption: little bit it&#39;s worth calling out one of

00:11:24.078 --> 00:11:28.078
Caption: the names that you should look up is

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:30.320
Caption: roman pitchler so roman pitchler has

00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:31.599
Caption: done a product management framework and

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.518
Caption: i know we&#39;re talking about product

00:11:31.599 --> 00:11:36.398
Caption: ownership but product owner actually

00:11:33.518 --> 00:11:38.559
Caption: belongs in the product management space

00:11:36.398 --> 00:11:40.880
Caption: and he really talks about the difference

00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:42.880
Caption: of a product owner in scrum versus a

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.039
Caption: product owner in the likes of safe or

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.760
Caption: scaled agile so in the larger larger

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:49.119
Caption: organizations the responsibilities of a

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.278
Caption: product owner might be a lot more

00:11:49.119 --> 00:11:53.278
Caption: focused than if you&#39;re in a true scrum

00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:54.799
Caption: team where you have to be thinking about

00:11:53.278 --> 00:11:56.239
Caption: the vision and the road map and maybe

00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:57.440
Caption: are a little bit more empowered

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:58.559
Caption: absolutely

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.559
Caption: now i know that we&#39;ve talked a little

00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:01.919
Caption: bit about a core scrum team and we&#39;ve

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:04.479
Caption: talked about how a product owner is

00:12:01.919 --> 00:12:06.159
Caption: responsible for driving the value

00:12:04.479 --> 00:12:08.078
Caption: but let&#39;s wanted to give you an example

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:09.679
Caption: of how delivering business value

00:12:08.078 --> 00:12:11.199
Caption: actually requires a symbiotic

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:12.719
Caption: relationship

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.000
Caption: with multiple stakeholders that you

00:12:12.719 --> 00:12:15.359
Caption: might come across

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Caption: i want to talk to you a little bit about

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:19.440
Caption: some roles that aren&#39;t traditional scrum

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.638
Caption: roles but you might actually find them

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.078
Caption: and you might have encountered them in

00:12:20.638 --> 00:12:23.599
Caption: different organizations and different

00:12:22.078 --> 00:12:25.119
Caption: projects that you&#39;ve worked on really

00:12:23.599 --> 00:12:26.799
Caption: because there were so many hybrid models

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:28.078
Caption: and hybrid approaches that people use

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:29.599
Caption: too

00:12:28.078 --> 00:12:31.359
Caption: first up a product owner has to work

00:12:29.599 --> 00:12:34.239
Caption: quite closely with the project sponsor

00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:36.078
Caption: they are more of an external facing role

00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:39.119
Caption: in the team and they really own that

00:12:36.078 --> 00:12:40.638
Caption: vision with the product owner

00:12:39.119 --> 00:12:42.398
Caption: the product owner themselves is

00:12:40.638 --> 00:12:44.479
Caption: responsible for that value there is

00:12:42.398 --> 00:12:46.559
Caption: their internal and external facing they

00:12:44.479 --> 00:12:48.799
Caption: get the they get the vision and they

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:50.398
Caption: communicate that to the customers bring

00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:51.838
Caption: that in and understand exactly what

00:12:50.398 --> 00:12:55.278
Caption: their issues are and use that to

00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:57.679
Caption: prioritize the backlog and deliver value

00:12:55.278 --> 00:12:59.518
Caption: through the development team

00:12:57.679 --> 00:13:01.039
Caption: a product owner has to work very closely

00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:02.799
Caption: with the business analyst

00:13:01.039 --> 00:13:04.239
Caption: business analysts are more internal

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:06.638
Caption: facing they are more in charge of the

00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:08.638
Caption: details they manage and they gather

00:13:06.638 --> 00:13:09.759
Caption: requirements and they refine them and

00:13:08.638 --> 00:13:11.199
Caption: they&#39;re there to facilitate

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.958
Caption: conversations that they bring key

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.919
Caption: players into the room to facilitate a

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.760
Caption: decision

00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:17.039
Caption: but the ultimate owner of decisions is a

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.440
Caption: product owner you&#39;re actually pretty

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:21.278
Caption: lucky if you have a ba and your product

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.278
Caption: owner so that some of the weight is

00:13:21.278 --> 00:13:25.679
Caption: taken off with shaping up that backlog

00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:27.039
Caption: and getting user insight and all of

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:28.638
Caption: those things if you work really well

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:30.799
Caption: with your ba and have that really good

00:13:28.638 --> 00:13:32.719
Caption: strong relationship you can just keep

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:35.518
Caption: driving that product forward absolutely

00:13:32.719 --> 00:13:37.679
Caption: it&#39;s a big role so any help is welcome

00:13:35.518 --> 00:13:39.440
Caption: and finally the relationship between a

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:40.958
Caption: product owner and a scrum master has

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.479
Caption: been likened in some of our research to

00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:46.799
Caption: the relationship between a ceo and a ceo

00:13:44.479 --> 00:13:48.159
Caption: you&#39;ve got your product owner out there

00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:49.440
Caption: screaming shouting the vision from the

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:52.398
Caption: rooftops and then you&#39;ve got your scrum

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.638
Caption: master who&#39;s there responsible for

00:13:52.398 --> 00:13:56.320
Caption: retrospectives and responsible from your

00:13:54.638 --> 00:13:58.638
Caption: agile ceremonies and

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.239
Caption: running refinements and making sure the

00:13:58.638 --> 00:14:02.719
Caption: team hum and making sure the team are

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:03.760
Caption: enabled to do exactly what they need to

00:14:02.719 --> 00:14:05.679
Caption: they&#39;re really good when you need the

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.119
Caption: team to be protected as well so lean on

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:08.398
Caption: your scrum master if you need a little

00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:10.159
Caption: bit of support and you&#39;re not getting

00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:11.760
Caption: where you need to absolutely

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:14.398
Caption: but sometimes the importance of a

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:17.119
Caption: product owner definitely gets lost which

00:14:14.398 --> 00:14:19.039
Caption: we have seen in multiple organizations

00:14:17.119 --> 00:14:20.559
Caption: and i think i was very lucky at the

00:14:19.039 --> 00:14:22.479
Caption: start of my product on our journey to

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:24.958
Caption: work in places who already understood

00:14:22.479 --> 00:14:27.119
Caption: the value but in more recent years i&#39;ve

00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:29.518
Caption: been focused in companies who actually

00:14:27.119 --> 00:14:31.599
Caption: have forgotten that and have proxy

00:14:29.518 --> 00:14:35.198
Caption: product owners or just don&#39;t have the

00:14:31.599 --> 00:14:35.198
Caption: role at all yeah absolutely

00:14:35.518 --> 00:14:39.119
Caption: more and more we&#39;re seeing organizations

00:14:37.359 --> 00:14:40.638
Caption: who undervalue the role of a product

00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:43.198
Caption: owner and of course the scrum master as

00:14:40.638 --> 00:14:45.599
Caption: well and ask one individual to actually

00:14:43.198 --> 00:14:47.039
Caption: take on both of these responsibilities

00:14:45.599 --> 00:14:48.479
Caption: we&#39;ve talked about how a product owner

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:49.919
Caption: is there to deliver business value and

00:14:48.479 --> 00:14:51.518
Caption: is there to be the voice of the customer

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:53.278
Caption: and is there to understand what the

00:14:51.518 --> 00:14:55.198
Caption: customers advocate for what the orders

00:14:53.278 --> 00:14:57.039
Caption: that they want delivered

00:14:55.198 --> 00:14:58.958
Caption: the scrum master on the other hand is

00:14:57.039 --> 00:15:00.719
Caption: there to advocate for the development

00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.000
Caption: team and protect them and make sure that

00:15:00.719 --> 00:15:03.599
Caption: whatever is being delivered is being

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.359
Caption: delivered sustainable in a way the

00:15:03.599 --> 00:15:07.039
Caption: development team can actually keep up

00:15:05.359 --> 00:15:09.278
Caption: with the demand

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:12.479
Caption: now being able to make decisions

00:15:09.278 --> 00:15:13.919
Caption: uh when you have one person doing both

00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:16.320
Caption: of these two roles advocating for

00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:18.479
Caption: different stakeholders

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.760
Caption: it&#39;s really difficult that internal

00:15:18.479 --> 00:15:22.320
Caption: friction that you have with these two

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.760
Caption: roles is so healthy and so important you

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.278
Caption: need that balance

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.639
Caption: between what the customer wants and what

00:15:25.278 --> 00:15:29.359
Caption: can actually be delivered as well and

00:15:26.638 --> 00:15:31.440
Caption: it&#39;s so important to actually have those

00:15:29.359 --> 00:15:33.440
Caption: in two separate roles i call them the

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.198
Caption: two-headed monster where you would have

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.638
Caption: a scrum master and a product owner so

00:15:35.198 --> 00:15:38.398
Caption: and if you have them both do it like

00:15:36.638 --> 00:15:39.919
Caption: you&#39;ve got one person doing those roles

00:15:38.398 --> 00:15:41.599
Caption: you&#39;re gonna find one&#39;s going to lean

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:43.198
Caption: towards the team more and the team&#39;s

00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:45.278
Caption: going to be spot on but they won&#39;t be

00:15:43.198 --> 00:15:46.880
Caption: delivering much or you&#39;ll find that

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.638
Caption: they&#39;ll be really leaning towards that

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.958
Caption: product vision and the future and they

00:15:48.638 --> 00:15:53.119
Caption: have a massively outweighted backlog but

00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:55.359
Caption: the team are having all sorts of

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:57.679
Caption: challenges absolutely the next one is

00:15:55.359 --> 00:15:58.638
Caption: also what i&#39;m seeing so if we

00:15:57.679 --> 00:16:00.799
Caption: yeah

00:15:58.638 --> 00:16:00.799
Caption: so

00:16:01.518 --> 00:16:05.599
Caption: we&#39;ll get there

00:16:03.039 --> 00:16:07.440
Caption: so agile teams with no product owner

00:16:05.599 --> 00:16:09.518
Caption: touched on that a little bit earlier on

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.599
Caption: so i couldn&#39;t quite find the image that

00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:13.599
Caption: i wanted but if you imagine this boat

00:16:11.599 --> 00:16:15.758
Caption: was round probably a little bit more

00:16:13.599 --> 00:16:19.198
Caption: like a life raft and you had a whole

00:16:15.758 --> 00:16:20.958
Caption: team on it no product owner no leader

00:16:19.198 --> 00:16:22.880
Caption: no direction didn&#39;t know where they were

00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.000
Caption: going just hoping someone&#39;s going to

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.599
Caption: help them out and tell them what they

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.599
Caption: need or come and pick them up and find

00:16:25.599 --> 00:16:30.239
Caption: them that&#39;s kind of what it looks like

00:16:27.599 --> 00:16:32.799
Caption: with an agile team with no product owner

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:34.799
Caption: now imagine that you have

00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:36.638
Caption: ruingo and you&#39;ve got someone at the

00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:38.078
Caption: helm direct in the direction you have a

00:16:36.638 --> 00:16:39.758
Caption: map you know where the end is you know

00:16:38.078 --> 00:16:41.599
Caption: where you need to get to everybody&#39;s

00:16:39.758 --> 00:16:43.359
Caption: rowing at the same time everybody&#39;s on

00:16:41.599 --> 00:16:44.958
Caption: board you know you&#39;ve got that rhythm

00:16:43.359 --> 00:16:47.278
Caption: that&#39;s what it feels like when you have

00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:51.198
Caption: a strong product owner working really

00:16:47.278 --> 00:16:52.239
Caption: well with their development team

00:16:51.198 --> 00:16:55.039
Caption: but

00:16:52.239 --> 00:16:56.880
Caption: even product owners can get it wrong

00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:57.919
Caption: so i just want to tell you about that

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.278
Caption: sure

00:16:57.919 --> 00:17:02.958
Caption: let&#39;s understand what anti-pattern is

00:17:01.278 --> 00:17:05.198
Caption: an anti-pattern is a commonly used

00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:06.798
Caption: process that despite initially appearing

00:17:05.198 --> 00:17:08.400
Caption: to be an appropriate and effective

00:17:06.798 --> 00:17:10.318
Caption: response to a problem

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.520
Caption: in fact has more bad consequences than

00:17:10.318 --> 00:17:13.198
Caption: good ones

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.799
Caption: what does that actually mean let&#39;s take

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:16.640
Caption: a look at this video and hopefully tell

00:17:14.798 --> 00:17:19.838
Caption: us something interesting and hopefully

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.838
Caption: it&#39;ll work yeah

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.400
Caption: hey jerry jerry are you okay with this

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.000

Caption: all right

00:18:27.038 --> 00:18:31.279
Caption: but i can figure it out myself any way

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.790
Caption: you want just

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:37.160

Caption: [Applause]

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.859
Caption: [Laughter]

00:18:53.439 --> 00:18:56.639
Caption: every time i watch that i spot something

00:18:55.199 --> 00:18:58.798
Caption: else that i can relate to when it comes

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.640
Caption: to product ownership um

00:18:58.798 --> 00:19:02.399
Caption: like one of the things that in that

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.239
Caption: video i spotted that i hadn&#39;t thought

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.760
Caption: about before was

00:19:04.239 --> 00:19:07.359
Caption: if you&#39;re not focused and giving your

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.199
Caption: team attention someone else might come

00:19:07.359 --> 00:19:11.599
Caption: and pinch them to work on their product

00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:13.599
Caption: that does happen what else do you see i

00:19:11.599 --> 00:19:14.959
Caption: mean how is he gonna how&#39;s it gonna cook

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:17.599
Caption: where&#39;s he gonna put his head where he&#39;s

00:19:14.959 --> 00:19:18.798
Caption: cooked when he&#39;s cooking like that&#39;s

00:19:17.599 --> 00:19:23.000
Caption: do you wanna see what actually went

00:19:18.798 --> 00:19:23.000
Caption: wrong and what what happened next

00:19:25.038 --> 00:19:28.000
Caption: you want it back the way it was yeah

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:30.000
Caption: that&#39;s right

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.520
Caption: you know i&#39;ll get you seinfeld

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.359
Caption: you want something one day the next day

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.679
Caption: you don&#39;t like it i mean come on man

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:37.839
Caption: make a decision

00:19:35.678 --> 00:19:39.678
Caption: yeah so i think it um calls out there&#39;s

00:19:37.839 --> 00:19:41.918
Caption: a real difference between allowing your

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:44.000
Caption: team you know to feel like to be

00:19:41.918 --> 00:19:46.239
Caption: autonomous and to get stuff done or not

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.918
Caption: giving them attention enough for them to

00:19:46.239 --> 00:19:50.479
Caption: understand really the direction of the

00:19:47.918 --> 00:19:52.479
Caption: product and you could end up and people

00:19:50.479 --> 00:19:53.918
Caption: do end up with things that they have to

00:19:52.479 --> 00:19:56.000
Caption: throw out and rebuild because they&#39;re

00:19:53.918 --> 00:19:58.239
Caption: unusable absolutely yeah if you just had

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.239
Caption: the patience to test it to be present to

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:01.678
Caption: actually do some of that user testing

00:20:00.239 --> 00:20:03.359
Caption: imagine you could have had a wonderful

00:20:01.678 --> 00:20:04.839
Caption: kitchen but

00:20:03.359 --> 00:20:08.158
Caption: that&#39;s on

00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:10.798
Caption: dairy here&#39;s our top five

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:13.600
Caption: anti-power patterns yeah so let&#39;s talk

00:20:10.798 --> 00:20:15.918
Caption: about this one uh under use of

00:20:13.599 --> 00:20:18.239
Caption: no and over using yes so this actually

00:20:15.918 --> 00:20:19.519
Caption: comes back to that normal cliche term

00:20:18.239 --> 00:20:21.280
Caption: that we&#39;ve heard a lot about under

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.200
Caption: promising and over delivering as a

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.039
Caption: product owner it is so easy to fall into

00:20:23.199 --> 00:20:26.959
Caption: the trap of trying to satisfy your

00:20:25.038 --> 00:20:28.079
Caption: customers and wanting to say yes yes yes

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:29.599
Caption: you&#39;ll do all of the things that they&#39;re

00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:30.719
Caption: asking for

00:20:29.599 --> 00:20:32.000
Caption: but

00:20:30.719 --> 00:20:34.319
Caption: it&#39;s gonna actually stand you in good

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.880
Caption: stead later on to be able to use the

00:20:34.319 --> 00:20:38.558
Caption: power of no in a powerful way actually

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.959
Caption: to highlight what your product actually

00:20:38.558 --> 00:20:43.199
Caption: is and what it isn&#39;t and be able to be

00:20:40.959 --> 00:20:45.038
Caption: reliable and be dependent on when you&#39;re

00:20:43.199 --> 00:20:46.959
Caption: actually committing to something people

00:20:45.038 --> 00:20:49.038
Caption: know that you will deliver because trust

00:20:46.959 --> 00:20:51.199
Caption: me your life is so much easier when you

00:20:49.038 --> 00:20:52.558
Caption: lower your expectations around you

00:20:51.199 --> 00:20:54.399
Caption: if you don&#39;t want a product that has

00:20:52.558 --> 00:20:55.839
Caption: loads of features and people can&#39;t

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.760
Caption: figure out their way around it then you

00:20:55.839 --> 00:21:00.558
Caption: really need to get good at saying no

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:03.039
Caption: uh next one i like awol absent without

00:21:00.558 --> 00:21:05.038
Caption: leave unavailable so as well as being a

00:21:03.038 --> 00:21:07.359
Caption: product owner i have been a scrum master

00:21:05.038 --> 00:21:09.359
Caption: and i have gone to a cafe to find the

00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:11.760
Caption: scrum master not the scrum master that&#39;s

00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:14.239
Caption: what i was the product owner when they

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.719
Caption: were not unavailable for stand-ups or

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:18.319
Caption: when they were the team had questions

00:21:16.719 --> 00:21:20.319
Caption: and the product owner was nowhere to be

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:21.918
Caption: seen you know in this scenario the

00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:23.199
Caption: stakeholders were probably pretty happy

00:21:21.918 --> 00:21:25.119
Caption: because you know they were having coffee

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:26.639
Caption: with a product owner the whole time but

00:21:25.119 --> 00:21:28.558
Caption: the dev team didn&#39;t really understand

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.479
Caption: what it was that they needed to do and

00:21:28.558 --> 00:21:34.158
Caption: everything got stuck no nothing was

00:21:30.479 --> 00:21:34.158
Caption: getting reviewed or moved on

00:21:34.239 --> 00:21:37.520
Caption: next one

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.280
Caption: it&#39;s all about me

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.080
Caption: uh so donna i realize that this report

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.760
Caption: has your name on it but uh the credit

00:21:42.079 --> 00:21:44.798
Caption: goes to me because i ordered you to do

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.520
Caption: this

00:21:44.798 --> 00:21:49.119
Caption: uh but i actually did the work

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.959
Caption: uh well i created the culture that made

00:21:49.119 --> 00:21:53.520
Caption: it all possible

00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:55.199
Caption: but i did the work

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.479
Caption: this is kind of two andy patterns

00:21:55.199 --> 00:21:59.439
Caption: stuffed into one so this is us being

00:21:56.479 --> 00:22:01.038
Caption: sneaky here on the one hand

00:21:59.439 --> 00:22:02.319
Caption: it is so important to give credit where

00:22:01.038 --> 00:22:04.079
Caption: credit is due

00:22:02.319 --> 00:22:05.678
Caption: you are responsible for the vision but

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:07.760
Caption: the development team are actually doing

00:22:05.678 --> 00:22:09.678
Caption: the work and it is so important for them

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.359
Caption: to get that face time with the customer

00:22:09.678 --> 00:22:13.119
Caption: and to build that relationship and build

00:22:11.359 --> 00:22:14.798
Caption: that trust so your customer understands

00:22:13.119 --> 00:22:16.400
Caption: that whenever whatever they&#39;re building

00:22:14.798 --> 00:22:18.158
Caption: whatever is being built is being built

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.119
Caption: to a standard that they&#39;re satisfied

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:20.960
Caption: with

00:22:19.119 --> 00:22:23.280
Caption: the other little anti-patent that&#39;s in

00:22:20.959 --> 00:22:25.199
Caption: there is as a product owner you are not

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.000
Caption: a manager you are not there to manage or

00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:30.079
Caption: give orders or direct people to do stuff

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.599
Caption: you are a leader you lead the vision and

00:22:30.079 --> 00:22:34.079
Caption: you leave the product and you lead the

00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:35.760
Caption: team towards success that way so stay

00:22:34.079 --> 00:22:37.760
Caption: out of the manager lane and stay in the

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.599
Caption: product management and the leadership

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.599
Caption: language

00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:44.719
Caption: all right designed by committee

00:22:41.599 --> 00:22:44.719
Caption: all right i&#39;m going to go closer so

00:22:44.959 --> 00:22:48.319
Caption: too scary too silly too different too

00:22:47.038 --> 00:22:50.079
Caption: dark

00:22:48.319 --> 00:22:51.439
Caption: not our brand voice witches are

00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:54.640
Caption: polarizing

00:22:51.439 --> 00:22:57.119
Caption: might alienate dog owners fine we give

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.719
Caption: up um so i did work in marketing a long

00:22:57.119 --> 00:23:00.798
Caption: time ago and i used to have a brief that

00:22:58.719 --> 00:23:02.479
Caption: had a lot of red pen or just said can

00:23:00.798 --> 00:23:04.000
Caption: you make something flash like i don&#39;t

00:23:02.479 --> 00:23:06.158
Caption: really know what that means

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.319
Caption: um really this whole designing by

00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:10.559
Caption: committee as a product owner you need to

00:23:08.319 --> 00:23:12.558
Caption: make decisions and if you listen to too

00:23:10.558 --> 00:23:13.918
Caption: many people in too many different voices

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:16.239
Caption: you&#39;re probably going to find it really

00:23:13.918 --> 00:23:19.359
Caption: hard to make those decisions

00:23:16.239 --> 00:23:21.839
Caption: so this is an example that freezes so

00:23:19.359 --> 00:23:23.280
Caption: many different teams gets them stuck and

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:24.640
Caption: there&#39;s probably one that kind of sets

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.919
Caption: the team a little bit offside like if

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.599
Caption: you can&#39;t make a decision then you

00:23:25.918 --> 00:23:29.599
Caption: probably shouldn&#39;t be a product owner

00:23:27.599 --> 00:23:32.000
Caption: it&#39;s very enough to me

00:23:29.599 --> 00:23:34.400
Caption: sure this is my favorite one caring

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.239
Caption: about the wrong metrics

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.559
Caption: so sally your output really isn&#39;t good

00:23:36.239 --> 00:23:40.798
Caption: enough uh only 15 lines of code we

00:23:38.558 --> 00:23:43.359
Caption: really need more do you mean the 15

00:23:40.798 --> 00:23:45.038
Caption: lines of code that cured cancer yeah you

00:23:43.359 --> 00:23:46.400
Caption: see 15 lines of code just really isn&#39;t

00:23:45.038 --> 00:23:47.839
Caption: cutting it we need so much more than

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.159
Caption: that

00:23:47.839 --> 00:23:52.319
Caption: imagine i gave you 10 seconds to draw as

00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:54.000
Caption: many flowers as you possibly could

00:23:52.319 --> 00:23:56.079
Caption: and then imagine i gave you 10 seconds

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.359
Caption: to draw one flower which one do you

00:23:56.079 --> 00:23:58.640
Caption: think is going to look a little bit

00:23:57.359 --> 00:23:59.918
Caption: better

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.400
Caption: when you

00:23:59.918 --> 00:24:04.158
Caption: miss retrospectives and showcases and

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.640
Caption: other adult ceremonies in favor of

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:08.320
Caption: project status reports by email it

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.640
Caption: forces you as a product owner to focus

00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:12.558
Caption: more on vanity metrics like velocity

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.640
Caption: burn up and burn down charts and it

00:24:12.558 --> 00:24:16.798
Caption: helps you actually avoid

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.919
Caption: uh the value that you&#39;re delivering and

00:24:16.798 --> 00:24:19.918
Caption: you&#39;re not actually keeping that front

00:24:17.918 --> 00:24:21.678
Caption: of mind whatsoever value is definitely

00:24:19.918 --> 00:24:23.599
Caption: one of the hardest things to measure but

00:24:21.678 --> 00:24:25.599
Caption: it is the most important

00:24:23.599 --> 00:24:27.119
Caption: leave the burn down charts and all of

00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:29.678
Caption: those to the scrum master to help

00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:31.599
Caption: identify challenges that the team face

00:24:29.678 --> 00:24:34.399
Caption: they&#39;re definitely not meant to be used

00:24:31.599 --> 00:24:37.760
Caption: to check the performance of the team

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:40.239
Caption: so if that is the badge what does good

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.239
Caption: look like

00:24:42.609 --> 00:24:45.809
Caption: [Applause]

00:24:46.798 --> 00:24:51.678
Caption: just kidding so let me just uh talk on a

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.520
Caption: few things that we&#39;ve discussed that are

00:24:51.678 --> 00:24:54.798
Caption: really important so i think one of the

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.400
Caption: things that you can get lost in as a

00:24:54.798 --> 00:24:58.639
Caption: product owner is just writing user

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.960
Caption: stories or developing a backlog but you

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.359
Caption: actually need to be able to look up and

00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:04.798
Caption: look forward so you need to understand

00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:06.880
Caption: how your product fits in with the

00:25:04.798 --> 00:25:08.319
Caption: overall business you need to have a

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.239
Caption: vision that you can share and bring

00:25:08.319 --> 00:25:12.000
Caption: people on board with and you need to be

00:25:10.239 --> 00:25:14.640
Caption: trying to think what is the next three

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.719
Caption: to six months to a year look like rather

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.039
Caption: than just focusing on a few sprints

00:25:16.719 --> 00:25:19.038
Caption: ahead

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:22.960
Caption: decisiveness don&#39;t need to really talk

00:25:21.279 --> 00:25:24.799
Caption: much about that again you need to be

00:25:22.959 --> 00:25:26.079
Caption: able to make a decision uh if you can&#39;t

00:25:24.798 --> 00:25:27.599
Caption: make a decision if you&#39;re one of those

00:25:26.079 --> 00:25:29.439
Caption: people that spends half an hour choosing

00:25:27.599 --> 00:25:31.918
Caption: from a menu you&#39;re probably not right

00:25:29.439 --> 00:25:34.479
Caption: for a product on a roll

00:25:31.918 --> 00:25:37.439
Caption: tenacity uh you&#39;re going to be exposed

00:25:34.479 --> 00:25:39.439
Caption: to so many challenges and you need to be

00:25:37.439 --> 00:25:41.918
Caption: able to get through those

00:25:39.439 --> 00:25:44.079
Caption: for the better for it and not give up so

00:25:41.918 --> 00:25:46.719
Caption: i find this is a really good trait in a

00:25:44.079 --> 00:25:48.319
Caption: product owner

00:25:46.719 --> 00:25:51.359
Caption: passionate

00:25:48.319 --> 00:25:53.199
Caption: if you don&#39;t care no one else will so

00:25:51.359 --> 00:25:54.558
Caption: make sure that you are working on

00:25:53.199 --> 00:25:55.760
Caption: something you care about if you don&#39;t

00:25:54.558 --> 00:25:57.359
Caption: care about you should probably look at

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.440
Caption: another product

00:25:57.359 --> 00:26:01.359
Caption: and you need to be able to kind of lead

00:25:59.439 --> 00:26:03.199
Caption: with that passion and help bring people

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:04.798
Caption: on the journey with you because as ice

00:26:03.199 --> 00:26:07.038
Caption: mentioned before you&#39;re not manager you

00:26:04.798 --> 00:26:08.719
Caption: can&#39;t mandate or tell people to do it

00:26:07.038 --> 00:26:10.639
Caption: you actually have to make them want to

00:26:08.719 --> 00:26:12.798
Caption: do it

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.400
Caption: and last up that kind of links in with

00:26:12.798 --> 00:26:16.798
Caption: storytelling so you need to be able to

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.640
Caption: spin a yarn don&#39;t ever assume that

00:26:16.798 --> 00:26:21.599
Caption: people know the journey that you&#39;ve been

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.760
Caption: on try and bring them back to the data

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:25.760
Caption: or the user information that you have

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.678
Caption: problems you&#39;re trying to solve instead

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.079
Caption: of just talking about what it is you&#39;ve

00:26:27.678 --> 00:26:30.079
Caption: delivered

00:26:30.159 --> 00:26:35.440
Caption: so

00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:37.839
Caption: next up but what do they do

00:26:35.439 --> 00:26:41.519
Caption: so kind of touched on it already so they

00:26:37.839 --> 00:26:43.119
Caption: lead the product vision and direction

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.000
Caption: if they are lost in a backlog they&#39;re

00:26:43.119 --> 00:26:47.119
Caption: not really kind of doing that direction

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.719
Caption: they need to be a really good

00:26:47.119 --> 00:26:50.319
Caption: communicator so you need to be able to

00:26:48.719 --> 00:26:52.079
Caption: take your insights and bring them back

00:26:50.319 --> 00:26:53.599
Caption: to the team and bring them on the

00:26:52.079 --> 00:26:56.399
Caption: journey and you also need to be able to

00:26:53.599 --> 00:26:59.439
Caption: do that outside the team

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:02.400
Caption: responsible for the backlog so let me

00:26:59.439 --> 00:27:04.479
Caption: just refresh what that means uh teams

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.479
Caption: customers stakeholders so let&#39;s just

00:27:04.479 --> 00:27:08.798
Caption: clear it up you are not responsible for

00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:11.119
Caption: every single story that&#39;s in the backlog

00:27:08.798 --> 00:27:12.798
Caption: but you are eliciting those from others

00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:14.640
Caption: and building out the backlog if you have

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:16.959
Caption: to just do that you are going to be very

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.959
Caption: busy so actually leverage the people you

00:27:16.959 --> 00:27:21.359
Caption: have around you to define what that

00:27:18.959 --> 00:27:22.479
Caption: backlog should look like

00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:24.158
Caption: what do you think about this one voice

00:27:22.479 --> 00:27:26.079
Caption: of the customer so we talked about it a

00:27:24.159 --> 00:27:27.520
Caption: lot especially um about internal

00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:29.359
Caption: external communication but where do you

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.799
Caption: get that value and that vision actually

00:27:29.359 --> 00:27:32.239
Caption: from you&#39;re getting that from the

00:27:30.798 --> 00:27:34.398
Caption: customer as a product owner you&#39;re

00:27:32.239 --> 00:27:36.079
Caption: advocating for them and advocating for

00:27:34.399 --> 00:27:37.520
Caption: what it is that you know that they need

00:27:36.079 --> 00:27:39.678
Caption: and that&#39;s actually going to deliver

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.520
Caption: value for them and impact them in a

00:27:39.678 --> 00:27:43.119
Caption: positive way

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.880
Caption: how about this next one

00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:48.158
Caption: ruthless prioritization so this was

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:50.959
Caption: actually a quote from our cto at jenny1

00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:52.480
Caption: thank you christian thanks christian

00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:54.158
Caption: as a product owner you need to be

00:27:52.479 --> 00:27:55.439
Caption: ruthless when it comes to prioritizing

00:27:54.159 --> 00:27:57.360
Caption: stuff in your backlog you need to be

00:27:55.439 --> 00:27:59.199
Caption: very clear on what your product is and

00:27:57.359 --> 00:28:00.719
Caption: what it isn&#39;t and you can&#39;t do

00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:03.199
Caption: everything and you shouldn&#39;t do

00:28:00.719 --> 00:28:04.479
Caption: absolutely every single story in there

00:28:03.199 --> 00:28:05.678
Caption: and you really need to be able to make

00:28:04.479 --> 00:28:07.359
Caption: that decision to say no this is not

00:28:05.678 --> 00:28:10.079
Caption: something that we&#39;re doing now or we&#39;re

00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:11.599
Caption: not doing this ever

00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:12.880
Caption: and finally as you need to be as a

00:28:11.599 --> 00:28:14.959
Caption: product owner this is probably the best

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.640
Caption: part of it i think being able to accept

00:28:14.959 --> 00:28:18.640
Caption: user stories and making sure things are

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.320
Caption: done done and hopefully towards the end

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.599
Caption: of this you&#39;ll actually get a chance to

00:28:20.319 --> 00:28:23.038
Caption: hopefully sign up on some of our

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:25.678
Caption: acceptance criteria that we set for you

00:28:23.038 --> 00:28:28.398
Caption: earlier as well

00:28:25.678 --> 00:28:31.038
Caption: we&#39;ll pay you in coffee

00:28:28.399 --> 00:28:32.960
Caption: so how do you know you&#39;re doing it right

00:28:31.038 --> 00:28:34.319
Caption: donna i love it sometimes when people

00:28:32.959 --> 00:28:36.079
Caption: are when you&#39;re building a really good

00:28:34.319 --> 00:28:37.439
Caption: product and people can actually see the

00:28:36.079 --> 00:28:39.599
Caption: value of delivery and they want a piece

00:28:37.439 --> 00:28:41.759
Caption: of the pie your inbox is just full of

00:28:39.599 --> 00:28:43.439
Caption: requests for copies and interactions to

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.839
Caption: see what it is and how they can get

00:28:43.439 --> 00:28:48.000
Caption: involved in it

00:28:45.839 --> 00:28:49.439
Caption: your team is actually reminding you of

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.359
Caption: the vision and that&#39;s a great indicator

00:28:49.439 --> 00:28:52.639
Caption: that you yourself are very clear on your

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:54.719
Caption: vision and you&#39;re communicating it

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.359
Caption: really well and quite regularly and if

00:28:54.719 --> 00:28:58.719
Caption: they&#39;re able to shout it back at you

00:28:57.359 --> 00:29:01.199
Caption: that&#39;s a really great indicator of how

00:28:58.719 --> 00:29:02.319
Caption: well you&#39;re doing with your vision

00:29:01.199 --> 00:29:03.918
Caption: the team you&#39;re working with are

00:29:02.319 --> 00:29:06.398
Caption: actually all talking about the customer

00:29:03.918 --> 00:29:08.319
Caption: as well so they understand exactly what

00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:09.919
Caption: they&#39;re building why they&#39;re building it

00:29:08.319 --> 00:29:11.439
Caption: how their customers gonna use it and how

00:29:09.918 --> 00:29:13.359
Caption: it&#39;s actually gonna impact their job

00:29:11.439 --> 00:29:14.959
Caption: they understand the value that they are

00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:17.119
Caption: delivering as well some of the best

00:29:14.959 --> 00:29:19.439
Caption: conversations i&#39;ve had with dev teams

00:29:17.119 --> 00:29:20.959
Caption: has been when they actually challenge me

00:29:19.439 --> 00:29:22.719
Caption: it reminds me that doesn&#39;t actually

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:25.599
Caption: align with what the customer problem is

00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:27.678
Caption: so having that like really intentional

00:29:25.599 --> 00:29:29.359
Caption: safe friction where you&#39;re able to

00:29:27.678 --> 00:29:31.038
Caption: reflect on the users and you know the

00:29:29.359 --> 00:29:33.119
Caption: team push back on you it&#39;s a great spot

00:29:31.038 --> 00:29:34.398
Caption: absolutely

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:36.158
Caption: why would anyone fight you when you&#39;re

00:29:34.399 --> 00:29:37.919
Caption: asking for budget because i can clearly

00:29:36.159 --> 00:29:39.200
Caption: see the value that you&#39;re delivering the

00:29:37.918 --> 00:29:41.439
Caption: return on investment that you&#39;ve been

00:29:39.199 --> 00:29:44.000
Caption: able to demonstrate previously it&#39;s just

00:29:41.439 --> 00:29:44.000
Caption: a winner

00:29:44.079 --> 00:29:47.519
Caption: and finally your customers your

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.079
Caption: stakeholders are actually saying no for

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:52.159
Caption: you it ties back in with knowing your

00:29:50.079 --> 00:29:54.079
Caption: vision and making it so clear internally

00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:55.520
Caption: and externally your customers are very

00:29:54.079 --> 00:29:57.278
Caption: clear on what your product is and what

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.799
Caption: it is not and they understand where

00:29:57.279 --> 00:30:00.320
Caption: something might go whether it be on your

00:29:58.798 --> 00:30:01.918
Caption: backlog now whether it be on your

00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:05.599
Caption: roadmap for the future but they&#39;re

00:30:01.918 --> 00:30:05.599
Caption: actually saying no for you

00:30:06.239 --> 00:30:10.399
Caption: so let&#39;s talk about one of the hardest

00:30:08.319 --> 00:30:12.000
Caption: parts of being a product owner i just

00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:13.679
Caption: smiling because how i get through

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.239
Caption: product ownership is definitely a sense

00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:17.599
Caption: of humor so one of the hardest parts is

00:30:16.239 --> 00:30:19.760
Caption: stakeholders

00:30:17.599 --> 00:30:21.760
Caption: and it&#39;s a bit of a zoo out there when

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.599
Caption: it comes to stakeholders and we&#39;re going

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.558
Caption: to talk about some of the members of

00:30:23.599 --> 00:30:30.000
Caption: that zoo so ice let&#39;s kick us off

00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:33.520
Caption: has anyone heard of the hippo yep cool

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.520
Caption: yep highest paid person&#39;s opinion so

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:38.558
Caption: not picking on ceos but it could be a

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.239
Caption: ceo it could be a general manager it

00:30:38.558 --> 00:30:42.719
Caption: could be a project it might not be

00:30:40.239 --> 00:30:43.918
Caption: totally wrong but they really believe in

00:30:42.719 --> 00:30:45.760
Caption: their opinion and they&#39;re going to come

00:30:43.918 --> 00:30:47.678
Caption: into your team and they&#39;re going to tell

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.599
Caption: you this is the most important thing

00:30:47.678 --> 00:30:51.760
Caption: that you need to do what do you do in

00:30:49.599 --> 00:30:53.520
Caption: that case such right so you need to be

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.199
Caption: able to empower them to make the right

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.799
Caption: decision but the way you do that is

00:30:55.199 --> 00:30:58.079
Caption: giving them information and giving them

00:30:56.798 --> 00:30:59.199
Caption: data and giving them examples and

00:30:58.079 --> 00:31:01.760
Caption: evidence of what you&#39;re going to be

00:30:59.199 --> 00:31:03.359
Caption: doing but the thing is they are not

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.320
Caption: going to be interested in the guts of

00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:05.760
Caption: the work they&#39;re not going to be

00:31:04.319 --> 00:31:07.119
Caption: interested in your back end code and all

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.119
Caption: of that kind of stuff you need to

00:31:07.119 --> 00:31:11.519
Caption: provide them with information to make

00:31:09.119 --> 00:31:13.119
Caption: the right decision at a level that&#39;s

00:31:11.519 --> 00:31:14.880
Caption: just for them

00:31:13.119 --> 00:31:16.239
Caption: awesome

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.079
Caption: next one

00:31:16.239 --> 00:31:20.719
Caption: rhino

00:31:18.079 --> 00:31:23.359
Caption: really high value new opportunity they

00:31:20.719 --> 00:31:25.199
Caption: like shiny things uh could be quoted to

00:31:23.359 --> 00:31:27.678
Caption: say i have an idea of course they have

00:31:25.199 --> 00:31:29.599
Caption: an idea they always have an idea uh they

00:31:27.678 --> 00:31:31.199
Caption: always have the latest feature latest

00:31:29.599 --> 00:31:32.719
Caption: thing in the market uh we should be

00:31:31.199 --> 00:31:34.639
Caption: doing this because someone else is doing

00:31:32.719 --> 00:31:36.158
Caption: it yep we want that one too and you

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.599
Caption: never really get a chance to finish off

00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:39.039
Caption: what you&#39;re already doing because

00:31:37.599 --> 00:31:41.518
Caption: they&#39;re always throwing something that&#39;s

00:31:39.038 --> 00:31:43.038
Caption: new at you

00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:44.399
Caption: to deal with a write-up to tame the

00:31:43.038 --> 00:31:45.678
Caption: rhino i think the best thing you can do

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:47.519
Caption: here is have a really clear

00:31:45.678 --> 00:31:50.000
Caption: prioritization framework and have a

00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:52.640
Caption: really clear roadmap demonstrate to the

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.798
Caption: rhino that you&#39;re not just randomly

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.799
Caption: saying yes or no to any features or

00:31:54.798 --> 00:31:59.278
Caption: anything that&#39;s coming in but it

00:31:56.798 --> 00:32:00.558
Caption: actually fits in somewhere and the story

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:02.320
Caption: makes sense

00:32:00.558 --> 00:32:04.319
Caption: one of the things with the rhino as well

00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:05.678
Caption: is don&#39;t give in to the beast because

00:32:04.319 --> 00:32:08.479
Caption: when you do they&#39;re going to come back

00:32:05.678 --> 00:32:11.760
Caption: with more ideas of course so try really

00:32:08.479 --> 00:32:13.038
Caption: hard to not let the rhino in

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.798
Caption: next up

00:32:13.038 --> 00:32:17.359
Caption: seagull well it&#39;s probably in a zoo

00:32:14.798 --> 00:32:19.359
Caption: eating from the bins but a

00:32:17.359 --> 00:32:21.119
Caption: loose connection there but the image

00:32:19.359 --> 00:32:22.798
Caption: kind of tells you all about the one

00:32:21.119 --> 00:32:24.558
Caption: minute manager known as the seagull

00:32:22.798 --> 00:32:26.158
Caption: doesn&#39;t have a fancy acronym so this

00:32:24.558 --> 00:32:27.278
Caption: person just swoops in when there is a

00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:28.799
Caption: problem you&#39;ve probably not seen them

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:30.320
Caption: for months they&#39;ve probably been off

00:32:28.798 --> 00:32:31.119
Caption: sorting out some else someone else&#39;s

00:32:30.319 --> 00:32:32.319
Caption: problem

00:32:31.119 --> 00:32:34.239
Caption: but they really like problems they&#39;re

00:32:32.319 --> 00:32:36.319
Caption: kind of attracted to them and they come

00:32:34.239 --> 00:32:38.158
Caption: in and they shout and they blame

00:32:36.319 --> 00:32:39.278
Caption: everyone and they make them feel about

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:41.600
Caption: this big

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:44.799
Caption: uh so i what do you do when you have a

00:32:41.599 --> 00:32:47.038
Caption: seagull that likes to swoop in and

00:32:44.798 --> 00:32:49.359
Caption: everywhere and then sleep

00:32:47.038 --> 00:32:51.839
Caption: apart from crying

00:32:49.359 --> 00:32:53.678
Caption: being there yeah as a product owner i

00:32:51.839 --> 00:32:55.760
Caption: think all you can do in this situation

00:32:53.678 --> 00:32:57.760
Caption: is bring your scrum master into the room

00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.079
Caption: and work tag team this right but you

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.640
Caption: need to do your best to protect and

00:33:00.079 --> 00:33:04.079
Caption: shield your team from this person i

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.440
Caption: think it comes a little bit back to the

00:33:04.079 --> 00:33:06.880
Caption: design by committee where everyone&#39;s

00:33:05.439 --> 00:33:08.558
Caption: going to have an opinion on something

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.000
Caption: but it&#39;s up to you as a product owner to

00:33:08.558 --> 00:33:11.278
Caption: decide what you&#39;ll take on and what you

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.399
Caption: want

00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:13.840
Caption: next up

00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:15.919
Caption: wolf

00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:17.599
Caption: working on the latest fire so they also

00:33:15.918 --> 00:33:19.759
Caption: like problems but they like them you

00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:21.760
Caption: know in the multitude and actually

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.678
Caption: probably lost sight of value they just

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.599
Caption: are always thinking this is a problem

00:33:23.678 --> 00:33:26.719
Caption: this needs fixed you know we need to do

00:33:25.599 --> 00:33:28.719
Caption: this better

00:33:26.719 --> 00:33:31.518
Caption: and focusing on that rather than how can

00:33:28.719 --> 00:33:33.760
Caption: we deliver more customer value so how do

00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:35.919
Caption: we deal with a wolf they have a short

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.320
Caption: attention span you know they&#39;re quite

00:33:35.918 --> 00:33:40.158
Caption: disruptive absolutely yeah but i get it

00:33:38.319 --> 00:33:41.839
Caption: right like i get it&#39;s scary to be

00:33:40.159 --> 00:33:43.919
Caption: building a product and see so much of

00:33:41.839 --> 00:33:45.839
Caption: technical debt racking up see so many

00:33:43.918 --> 00:33:47.038
Caption: bugs that are coming through as well

00:33:45.839 --> 00:33:49.918
Caption: i think the best thing to do with the

00:33:47.038 --> 00:33:51.038
Caption: wolf really is to sit them down and go

00:33:49.918 --> 00:33:52.079
Caption: through a bit of a structured approach

00:33:51.038 --> 00:33:53.678
Caption: there&#39;s a couple of different ways that

00:33:52.079 --> 00:33:56.079
Caption: you can tackle technical

00:33:53.678 --> 00:33:58.398
Caption: bugs and issues you can either dedicate

00:33:56.079 --> 00:34:00.079
Caption: one sprint to just bug stomping get it

00:33:58.399 --> 00:34:01.119
Caption: all out of the way get it done and then

00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:02.558
Caption: move on

00:34:01.119 --> 00:34:04.000
Caption: or you can also do an approach where

00:34:02.558 --> 00:34:05.518
Caption: you&#39;re actually committing to taking a

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.519
Caption: couple of stories and a couple of bugs

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:08.719
Caption: into every single sprint and keep going

00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:10.800
Caption: with that approach until you&#39;re all

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:13.598
Caption: satisfied with how the products going

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.119
Caption: so last but not least

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:18.240
Caption: zebra

00:34:15.118 --> 00:34:19.199
Caption: zero evidence but really arrogant

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:21.839
Caption: um

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:24.320
Caption: so they have a gut feeling uh they have

00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:26.000
Caption: nothing really to back up they&#39;re so

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.839
Caption: sure you know it&#39;s kind of similar we&#39;re

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.358
Caption: not saying that they come in certain

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:31.119
Caption: boxes you might find they have

00:34:29.358 --> 00:34:33.279
Caption: multitudes of these

00:34:31.118 --> 00:34:34.878
Caption: kind of different traits um but this one

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.638
Caption: really comes in and has absolutely no

00:34:34.878 --> 00:34:37.918
Caption: evidence to back it up and it&#39;s really

00:34:36.638 --> 00:34:39.838
Caption: probably not they don&#39;t need to be

00:34:37.918 --> 00:34:41.760
Caption: senior they&#39;re just really sure on their

00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:42.960
Caption: opinion

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.638
Caption: data

00:34:42.959 --> 00:34:46.158
Caption: bring them on the journey with you show

00:34:44.638 --> 00:34:47.760
Caption: them the evidence show them the data

00:34:46.158 --> 00:34:49.199
Caption: show them your research and show them

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.638
Caption: how you&#39;ve demonstrated that what you&#39;re

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:51.838
Caption: doing works

00:34:50.638 --> 00:34:53.838
Caption: let them know that you&#39;re willing to

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:56.560
Caption: maybe test their idea for a new feature

00:34:53.839 --> 00:34:57.920
Caption: out in a low-cost low-risk way but be

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.680
Caption: very clear from the start that you&#39;re

00:34:57.919 --> 00:35:01.358
Caption: not willing to significantly invest in

00:34:59.679 --> 00:35:03.919
Caption: their idea without a proper proof of

00:35:01.358 --> 00:35:05.279
Caption: concept and some evidence backing it

00:35:03.919 --> 00:35:07.679
Caption: so with all of that

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.520
Caption: what animal would make a good product

00:35:07.679 --> 00:35:11.520
Caption: owner

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.599
Caption: nobody cool

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.479
Caption: no ideas not an animal

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:18.000
Caption: no they&#39;re a zookeeper so i actually

00:35:16.479 --> 00:35:20.479
Caption: went into the depths of the internet to

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.560
Caption: try and make a connection here and found

00:35:20.479 --> 00:35:25.040
Caption: a zookeeper job description which

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:27.680
Caption: definitely has two descriptions that

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.160
Caption: suit a product owner so one is you need

00:35:27.679 --> 00:35:32.879
Caption: to understand the behavior of your

00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:34.639
Caption: animals or your stakeholders and and the

00:35:32.879 --> 00:35:36.959
Caption: other one is that you need to tailor

00:35:34.639 --> 00:35:39.598
Caption: your approach depending on who they are

00:35:36.959 --> 00:35:41.679
Caption: so you need to think about what you can

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:43.920
Caption: do to really kind of get the best from

00:35:41.679 --> 00:35:45.439
Caption: your stakeholders and appease them and

00:35:43.919 --> 00:35:48.879
Caption: keep your team

00:35:45.439 --> 00:35:50.719
Caption: working working forward

00:35:48.879 --> 00:35:52.078
Caption: so hopefully we haven&#39;t scared you off

00:35:50.719 --> 00:35:54.639
Caption: are you still thinking about being a

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:55.839
Caption: product owner

00:35:54.639 --> 00:35:57.919
Caption: let&#39;s talk a little bit about what

00:35:55.839 --> 00:35:59.680
Caption: success look like we&#39;ve touched on all

00:35:57.919 --> 00:36:01.439
Caption: this already but repetition is going to

00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:03.838
Caption: help us all right so

00:36:01.439 --> 00:36:06.159
Caption: key things i won&#39;t touch them too much

00:36:03.839 --> 00:36:07.839
Caption: vision know where you&#39;re heading

00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:09.118
Caption: road map you know it&#39;s good to have some

00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:11.359
Caption: real good outcomes that you want to

00:36:09.118 --> 00:36:12.799
Caption: achieve as you go forward don&#39;t get

00:36:11.358 --> 00:36:13.759
Caption: stuck in a gantt chart that&#39;s another

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:17.040
Caption: story

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.959
Caption: backlog um continuously that&#39;s why the

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.119
Caption: infinity symbol is there

00:36:18.959 --> 00:36:23.040
Caption: i have had questions about backlog it&#39;s

00:36:21.118 --> 00:36:25.679
Caption: not a once-off

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.520
Caption: kind of activity it&#39;s a continuous

00:36:25.679 --> 00:36:28.879
Caption: activity in fact really when you learn

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.479
Caption: anything new you should be going back to

00:36:28.879 --> 00:36:31.759
Caption: the backlog and thinking

00:36:30.479 --> 00:36:34.320
Caption: is this still the thing that we should

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.760
Caption: be working on but not a sprint backlog

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.920
Caption: that&#39;s for the scrum master to talk to

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.520
Caption: you about success matters

00:36:37.919 --> 00:36:41.358
Caption: make sure that you&#39;re not only talking

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.719
Caption: about what you think the value is that

00:36:41.358 --> 00:36:44.319
Caption: you&#39;re going to drive but try and find a

00:36:42.719 --> 00:36:46.078
Caption: way to measure it so

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.239
Caption: if you can actually measure it it really

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:49.440
Caption: helps you with budget requirements helps

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:50.639
Caption: you with your team and it helps you

00:36:49.439 --> 00:36:52.719
Caption: understand where it is you should be

00:36:50.639 --> 00:36:55.519
Caption: taking the product next

00:36:52.719 --> 00:36:57.838
Caption: a one pager so uh if you look at the

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.520
Caption: atlassian health check so there is an

00:36:57.839 --> 00:37:01.599
Caption: atlassian playbook which is pretty

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.359
Caption: helpful um they have a health check and

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:05.920
Caption: it talks about one pager which isn&#39;t

00:37:03.358 --> 00:37:07.118
Caption: something that is asked for necessarily

00:37:05.919 --> 00:37:08.639
Caption: in all of the different types of

00:37:07.118 --> 00:37:10.719
Caption: methodologies that we&#39;ve talked about

00:37:08.639 --> 00:37:12.399
Caption: but it&#39;s your poster and it helps people

00:37:10.719 --> 00:37:15.040
Caption: understand what it is you do in a

00:37:12.399 --> 00:37:18.239
Caption: language that they can understand

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.599
Caption: and the final part 100 committed utopia

00:37:18.239 --> 00:37:21.598
Caption: if you could get a product donor that

00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:23.680
Caption: could just be with you full time you

00:37:21.599 --> 00:37:25.839
Caption: would have way more success

00:37:23.679 --> 00:37:28.719
Caption: good one than you would if you had like

00:37:25.839 --> 00:37:30.960
Caption: part-time or what i&#39;ve seen whether 0.1

00:37:28.719 --> 00:37:32.800
Caption: of an fte which is yeah definitely not

00:37:30.959 --> 00:37:34.399
Caption: enough to be really successful in the

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.760
Caption: role absolutely

00:37:34.399 --> 00:37:38.479
Caption: now it seems like we painted a bit of a

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.679
Caption: picture of a fantasy here with unicorns

00:37:38.479 --> 00:37:41.358
Caption: and

00:37:39.679 --> 00:37:43.280
Caption: you need to be able to do everything all

00:37:41.358 --> 00:37:45.358
Caption: the ones all the time but i really want

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.000
Caption: to highlight that this is

00:37:45.358 --> 00:37:50.959
Caption: about you as a product owner leading the

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Caption: vision being value obsessed and focusing

00:37:50.959 --> 00:37:55.919
Caption: more on growth not perfection if you&#39;re

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.320
Caption: able to work towards

00:37:55.919 --> 00:38:00.479
Caption: your ideal vision with some of these

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.160
Caption: things in mind you&#39;ll be right

00:38:00.479 --> 00:38:04.159
Caption: yeah roman pitcher actually talks about

00:38:02.159 --> 00:38:05.598
Caption: it if you use his product management

00:38:04.159 --> 00:38:07.118
Caption: framework then you could just pick the

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:08.720
Caption: things that you need to work on and just

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:10.879
Caption: continuously evolve on that you don&#39;t

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:13.040
Caption: need to be perfect to everything

00:38:10.879 --> 00:38:15.199
Caption: and just how you get started so i&#39;ll

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.359
Caption: give you a bit of my experience i fell

00:38:15.199 --> 00:38:18.800
Caption: into product ownership so when i first

00:38:17.358 --> 00:38:21.358
Caption: became a product owner i wouldn&#39;t say i

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:23.199
Caption: really knew what that meant um and the

00:38:21.358 --> 00:38:25.279
Caption: reason that i ended up there was because

00:38:23.199 --> 00:38:26.800
Caption: i was working in a digital space and i

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.159
Caption: was working on websites and i was

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.760
Caption: wondering what was happening to all the

00:38:28.159 --> 00:38:31.679
Caption: customers as they went through the sales

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.000
Caption: funnel they just kind of disappear and i

00:38:31.679 --> 00:38:36.159
Caption: had this target at the end but actually

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.079
Caption: island could impact this park

00:38:36.159 --> 00:38:40.399
Caption: um so what i did was i actually got a

00:38:38.079 --> 00:38:42.640
Caption: role in some legacy systems that no one

00:38:40.399 --> 00:38:44.639
Caption: wanted to do because they were dying but

00:38:42.639 --> 00:38:46.239
Caption: the thing is you know users still using

00:38:44.639 --> 00:38:48.639
Caption: those systems i think as well are still

00:38:46.239 --> 00:38:50.239
Caption: around so for me that gave me an in i

00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:51.039
Caption: chose a role that no one else wanted to

00:38:50.239 --> 00:38:52.000
Caption: do

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.359
Caption: um

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.959
Caption: so i would recommend that you have a

00:38:53.358 --> 00:38:56.399
Caption: look for opportunities like that you

00:38:54.959 --> 00:38:57.760
Caption: need to if you&#39;re a product owner then

00:38:56.399 --> 00:39:00.319
Caption: you should be attracted to new

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.760
Caption: opportunities and and also find yourself

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.839
Caption: a mentor and figure out what your

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.679
Caption: organization already has or you know if

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:07.200
Caption: you&#39;re working in our organization and

00:39:05.679 --> 00:39:09.199
Caption: you&#39;re doing really well it&#39;s gonna be

00:39:07.199 --> 00:39:10.800
Caption: easier to find a role in an organization

00:39:09.199 --> 00:39:12.479
Caption: that knows you than maybe starting out

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.079
Caption: with another one

00:39:12.479 --> 00:39:15.598
Caption: and there&#39;s so many people you can lean

00:39:14.079 --> 00:39:17.359
Caption: on and meet up so you can lean on as

00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:19.839
Caption: well absolutely speaking of people that

00:39:17.358 --> 00:39:21.919
Caption: you can lean on here is where we

00:39:19.839 --> 00:39:23.760
Caption: actually gathered a lot of our

00:39:21.919 --> 00:39:25.838
Caption: inspiration for this talk we&#39;ve got

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:28.560
Caption: people like jeff payton melissa perry

00:39:25.839 --> 00:39:29.760
Caption: marty kagan and roman pictures or who

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.320
Caption: we&#39;ve mentioned multiple times through

Caption: amazing

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.079
Caption: do you feel like you understand common

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.239
Caption: stakeholder types that you might

00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:39.200
Caption: encounter and maybe how to deal with

00:40:36.239 --> 00:40:40.560

00:40:39.199 --> 00:40:41.679
Caption: and if you want to be a product owner do

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.479
Caption: you feel like you understand how you

00:40:41.679 --> 00:40:45.520
Caption: might get started in the role

00:40:44.479 --> 00:40:46.879
Caption: amazing

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.159
Caption: awesome

00:40:46.879 --> 00:40:50.318
Caption: i just want to leave with one more

00:40:48.159 --> 00:40:51.679
Caption: question what do they actually own

00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:54.400
Caption: that&#39;s the one thing i know that we

00:40:51.679 --> 00:40:56.559
Caption: haven&#39;t talked about uh the answer and i

00:40:54.399 --> 00:40:59.039
Caption: might get a few looks here is nothing uh

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:01.119
Caption: if you look at melissa parry she wrote

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:03.040
Caption: the book the build trap and she will

00:41:01.118 --> 00:41:05.039
Caption: tell you that the name actually causes a

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.439
Caption: wealth of confusion and the product is

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.199
Caption: actually owned by the team at stretch

00:41:07.439 --> 00:41:11.280
Caption: you can say they own the decision and

00:41:09.199 --> 00:41:12.879
Caption: they own driving the value

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.319
Caption: so there is so much more that we can

00:41:12.879 --> 00:41:16.078
Caption: cover and so much more that we can talk

00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:17.680
Caption: about including that last part though we

00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:18.880
Caption: want to be able to unpack that so we&#39;ve

00:41:17.679 --> 00:41:21.040
Caption: actually put together a little bit of a

00:41:18.879 --> 00:41:22.318
Caption: backlog ourselves so hopefully you&#39;ll

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.400
Caption: get to keep an eye out for product

00:41:22.319 --> 00:41:26.239
Caption: ownership part two

00:41:24.399 --> 00:41:28.799
Caption: but until then with your feedback we&#39;ll

00:41:26.239 --> 00:41:33.319
Caption: figure out where that looks exactly

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:33.319
Caption: thank you very much folks thank you
