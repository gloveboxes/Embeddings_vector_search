WEBVTT

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.799
Caption: okay welcome everybody we&#39;ll make a

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.420
Caption: start I think people are going to

00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:23.109
Caption: continue streaming in as they get their

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.770
Caption: lunch but we will make a start my name

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.569
Caption: is Sean I&#39;m the CTO at Bank West we&#39;re

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.840
Caption: very very proud to be associated with

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:35.319
Caption: DDD since the very first one four years

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.939
Caption: ago I&#39;m absolutely blown away by how

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:42.189
Caption: much this conference has grown from

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:44.110
Caption: about 80 people down at the Swan River I

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:47.199
Caption: think it was down in in Burswood a few

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.270
Caption: years ago and to see it scale to 500

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.600
Caption: people here today the amount of

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.400
Caption: engagement the quality of the speakers

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:56.769
Caption: hats off to rob and all of the

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.850
Caption: volunteers who&#39;ve helped today together

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.299
Caption: because it&#39;s been a phenomenal

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:04.540
Caption: conference so far a bank west we&#39;re

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:08.709
Caption: undergoing our own revolution we&#39;ve just

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.229
Caption: implemented a bank wide revolution

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:13.449
Caption: towards agile ways of working end to end

00:01:11.228 --> 00:01:15.908
Caption: the whole bank has changed its operating

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:18.459
Caption: model we&#39;re also undergoing a technology

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:23.019
Caption: driven revolution where we are building

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:26.440
Caption: a new technology sack and luckily we&#39;ve

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:28.419
Caption: got Mike here helping us plan our

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.120
Caption: migration onto our new technology sack

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:33.158
Caption: and I met Mike about three months ago in

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.319
Caption: London where I heard him give a talk

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:37.569
Caption: about software revolutions and DevOps

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.750
Caption: and continuous delivery so we flew him

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.449
Caption: over here to come and give us a hand and

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.729
Caption: very luckily it coincided with

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:48.039
Caption: dee-dee-dee so we were able to get him

00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:49.509
Caption: to give his talk today if you want to

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.700
Caption: hear more about bankwest we&#39;ve got our

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.319
Caption: orange grove out the side which is

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:55.930
Caption: manned all day and you can come and

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.339
Caption: speak to people about what it&#39;s like to

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.889
Caption: work at Bank West what we&#39;re doing in

00:01:57.339 --> 00:02:01.839
Caption: the technology space and the only

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:04.629
Caption: criteria is you must like orange or

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:08.649
Caption: oranges and with serving fresh orange

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:11.048
Caption: juice there all day and but yeah I&#39;ll

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.720
Caption: hand over now to Mike who&#39;s gonna give

00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:17.220
Caption: his talk on how software revolutions

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.220
Caption: happen thank you

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:27.799
Caption: thanks everyone

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.250
Caption: huh it&#39;s working you can hear me I hope

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.889
Caption: not

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.529
Caption: there we go we&#39;re live so yes hi

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.699
Caption: everyone I&#39;m Mike I want to share with

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:38.990
Caption: you something I&#39;m really excited about

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:41.779
Caption: it&#39;s a little bit about why I think

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.630
Caption: agile represents a new paradigm in

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:46.610
Caption: software and also why DevOps and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.510
Caption: continuous delivery are instrumental and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.830
Caption: that story the idea oh sorry thank you

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:57.559
Caption: to all of our sponsors aren&#39;t they

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.509
Caption: awesome so the ideas from Forrest talk

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:02.929
Caption: really came from and were inspired by

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:05.239
Caption: this book this is the structure of

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:08.719
Caption: scientific revolutions that was written

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:14.200
Caption: in the late 60s it was Thomas Kuhn wrote

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:18.259
Caption: the book at the time Kuhn he was

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:21.500
Caption: studying for his PhD in physics but he

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:24.049
Caption: also happened to have to teach a course

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.289
Caption: on the history of science as part of his

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.260
Caption: duties at the University and what he

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:32.329
Caption: realized from teaching this to to the

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:34.339
Caption: students was that the way that we teach

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.970
Caption: and understand science and the way

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:39.319
Caption: science is moving forward is completely

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.458
Caption: different from the way it actually

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.170
Caption: happens and instead of soft science

00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:47.809
Caption: being some kind of incremental journey

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.759
Caption: towards finding the truth what happens

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:51.800
Caption: in actual fact is that we could go along

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:54.080
Caption: in these paradigms it was this book that

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.440
Caption: first kind of came up with the term the

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.809
Caption: paradigm shift so scientists were

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.160
Caption: operating in a paradigm until they had a

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:04.399
Caption: big revolution and they had a new

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:08.449
Caption: paradigm and this was the normal way of

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:10.488
Caption: scientific progress so this is the the

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.500
Caption: proper method this is Howard generally

00:04:10.488 --> 00:04:15.259
Caption: taught at school and universities that

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.450
Caption: this is how science works we make

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:20.359
Caption: observations think of interesting

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.700
Caption: questions formulate hypothesis develop

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.820
Caption: testable predictions run they run the

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.800
Caption: tests figure out what we&#39;ve learned this

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.158
Caption: is the scientific method right this is

00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:32.638
Caption: what we believe

00:04:29.158 --> 00:04:35.398
Caption: as science and it is kind of true it is

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.468
Caption: kind of how things work but it&#39;s also

00:04:35.398 --> 00:04:39.109
Caption: not actually how we&#39;ve progressed

00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:42.658
Caption: through history

00:04:39.109 --> 00:04:45.799
Caption: what Kuhn says is actually what we do is

00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:48.598
Caption: we go through these revolutions and our

00:04:45.799 --> 00:04:50.938
Caption: scientific fields are reconstructed from

00:04:48.598 --> 00:04:55.199
Caption: the ground up through each of these

00:04:50.938 --> 00:04:59.479
Caption: revolutions we have new fundamentals so

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:02.009
Caption: this is Koons cycle of the revolutions

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.899
Caption: normally we were going through this

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.628
Caption: normal science which which does actually

00:05:03.898 --> 00:05:08.758
Caption: look quite like the pauper model it

00:05:06.628 --> 00:05:10.799
Caption: occurs within a worldview that this was

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.588
Caption: what really is the paradigm we all share

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:16.799
Caption: this common worldview and what science

00:05:13.588 --> 00:05:19.528
Caption: is trying to do in this phase of of the

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:21.299
Caption: field is to bring nature and theory into

00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:24.828
Caption: closer agreement this is what scientists

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:27.868
Caption: are doing the thing is that during our

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:29.639
Caption: time scientists take the foundations of

00:05:27.868 --> 00:05:31.859
Caption: their field for granted they don&#39;t have

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.679
Caption: to rewrite textbooks the University

00:05:31.859 --> 00:05:38.088
Caption: literature is sound there&#39;s there is a

00:05:34.678 --> 00:05:40.588
Caption: method for growing within this field and

00:05:38.088 --> 00:05:44.368
Caption: most importantly you generally get the

00:05:40.588 --> 00:05:46.438
Caption: results you expect to get so when we

00:05:44.368 --> 00:05:48.468
Caption: that the Large Hadron Collider and did

00:05:46.438 --> 00:05:51.329
Caption: the experiments we found the Higgs boson

00:05:48.468 --> 00:05:52.799
Caption: this was the result we kind of expected

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:54.059
Caption: that&#39;s why people spend money on the

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:56.338
Caption: experiment in the first place

00:05:54.058 --> 00:05:58.968
Caption: same with Dolly the sheep let&#39;s try and

00:05:56.338 --> 00:06:01.799
Caption: clone a mammal well

00:05:58.968 --> 00:06:03.419
Caption: they cloned a mammal there&#39;s no big

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:06.239
Caption: surprise it&#39;s an achievement for sure

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.579
Caption: and it&#39;s bringing science forward but it

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:09.958
Caption: we&#39;re not really falsifying hypothesis

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:13.229
Caption: we&#39;re actually getting the results we

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:16.289
Caption: expect the thing is though when

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.209
Caption: operating in a paradigm paradigms and

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.639
Caption: science is never correct we&#39;re not

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:23.099
Caption: finished with science and what happens

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.688
Caption: is all these little sometimes anomaly

00:06:23.098 --> 00:06:26.639
Caption: start to crop up they they don&#39;t fit

00:06:24.688 --> 00:06:29.669
Caption: into the worldview and doesn&#39;t make

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.229
Caption: sense and scientists some scientists

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.269
Caption: start to question whether we have the

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.919
Caption: right foundations for the field but

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:37.949
Caption: importantly even if there are things

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:39.809
Caption: that don&#39;t fit into the field people

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:41.970
Caption: will hold on to the paradigm because

00:06:39.808 --> 00:06:43.679
Caption: that&#39;s the foundation of the field the

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.790
Caption: give up the paradigm unless there&#39;s

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:49.889
Caption: another paradigm to replace it

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:52.170
Caption: F enough anomalies crop up eventually

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.910
Caption: the field gets into a state of crisis

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.470
Caption: and people start to think really outside

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.630
Caption: of the box starting to question the

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.260
Caption: fundamentals there&#39;s a lot of discontent

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:03.059
Caption: and fighting and arguments in the field

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.520
Caption: now the only way to get out of a crisis

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:08.100
Caption: is through a revolution and to get a

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:11.549
Caption: revolution you need a new theory a new

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:14.640
Caption: foundation for the field and this new

00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:16.739
Caption: theory will completely wipe away the

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:21.120
Caption: previous paradigm that and theories that

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:24.449
Caption: we had and the old paradigm and the old

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:26.190
Caption: paradigm is completely replaced and then

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:29.550
Caption: we get this paradigm change or paradigm

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:31.440
Caption: shift and it&#39;s follows the Highland

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:33.779
Caption: pattern that can only be one paradigm in

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.170
Caption: a field at a time and older views are

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:40.049
Caption: simply read out of the the profession

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:42.060
Caption: people who hold on to the old world view

00:07:40.049 --> 00:07:45.539
Caption: are no longer relevant and the new

00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:48.269
Caption: fields so I hope you can start to see

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:51.930
Caption: that this can be quite similar to a lot

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:54.059
Caption: of the history of software so there we

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:56.399
Caption: go we go through paradigms one paradigm

00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:58.889
Caption: to the next paradigm and it seems messy

00:07:56.399 --> 00:08:01.229
Caption: it seems wrong but this is actually the

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:03.530
Caption: normal pattern this is how science

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:07.080
Caption: progresses it&#39;s not a bug it&#39;s a feature

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:09.149
Caption: we do the progress we can and a paradigm

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:11.489
Caption: until it doesn&#39;t fit and then we&#39;ve cast

00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:15.479
Caption: it aside and find the new one this is

00:08:11.489 --> 00:08:17.339
Caption: how science progresses just to make it a

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.830
Caption: bit more concrete there was a time when

00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:22.859
Caption: we all believed that the world was the

00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:24.389
Caption: center of the universe and I made

00:08:22.859 --> 00:08:26.039
Caption: perfect sense because we&#39;re standing

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.780
Caption: still obviously and everything&#39;s flying

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.330
Caption: past us there goes the Sun there goes

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:34.229
Caption: the moon there goes the Stars this is

00:08:30.329 --> 00:08:36.000
Caption: normal but Copernicus and Kepler well

00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:38.489
Caption: they were thinking wow this doesn&#39;t

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.140
Caption: really fit that doesn&#39;t fit what we&#39;re

00:08:38.489 --> 00:08:45.419
Caption: seeing in this guy something&#39;s not right

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:47.070
Caption: and so they came up with this new world

00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:49.859
Caption: view it was like instead of geocentrism

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:51.000
Caption: we had heliocentrism so yeah maybe the

00:08:49.859 --> 00:08:53.010
Caption: Sun is the center of the universe

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.140
Caption: doesn&#39;t that make more sense it&#39;s not

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.500
Caption: quite right answer either but it was a

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.650
Caption: step

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:01.770
Caption: in the right direction fifty years later

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:04.320
Caption: we had Newton coming up with some

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.679
Caption: interesting thoughts what if the way

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.410
Caption: that the planets move around the Sun

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:12.390
Caption: operated in the same model as the way

00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:14.250
Caption: ball flies through the air what about if

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.980
Caption: these equations were general what about

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.390
Caption: if we had a general law of gravity and

00:09:16.979 --> 00:09:21.089
Caption: this was important as well because this

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.980
Caption: was the first time and in history where

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.840
Caption: we started to understand that there

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:26.669
Caption: wasn&#39;t different laws for the things

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.280
Caption: that happened in the sky the celestial

00:09:26.669 --> 00:09:34.469
Caption: bodies had the same physics as the

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:36.780
Caption: things on earth and actually Newton&#39;s

00:09:34.469 --> 00:09:40.409
Caption: laws served us very well for quite some

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:42.360
Caption: time and then eventually we got Einstein

00:09:40.409 --> 00:09:44.789
Caption: coming along thinking well maybe it&#39;s

00:09:42.359 --> 00:09:47.039
Caption: not space and time that&#39;s fixed maybe

00:09:44.789 --> 00:09:51.539
Caption: it&#39;s the speed of light that&#39;s fixed and

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:55.199
Caption: speed in time or kind of squirrely so

00:09:51.539 --> 00:09:56.669
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s how for example physics

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.799
Caption: has been progressing through successive

00:09:56.669 --> 00:10:01.049
Caption: revolutions then we had quantum field

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:02.369
Caption: theory and it&#39;s going to continue it&#39;s

00:10:01.049 --> 00:10:06.239
Caption: just going to continue this is how we

00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:07.369
Caption: make progress now then how does this map

00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:10.080
Caption: into software

00:10:07.369 --> 00:10:11.940
Caption: well software is a much younger field

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.250
Caption: you could go back to Babbage and ADA

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.289
Caption: Lovelace but I think it really started

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.270
Caption: with cheering in the Turing machine so

00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:20.338
Caption: this was the late 30s where cheering is

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:24.239
Caption: starting to talk about the Turing

00:10:20.338 --> 00:10:25.830
Caption: machine and it was only if thirty years

00:10:24.239 --> 00:10:27.510
Caption: later when we had our first software

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:31.290
Caption: crisis and it was called the software

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.910
Caption: crisis this was this was an open

00:10:31.289 --> 00:10:36.088
Caption: discussion amongst the academics and

00:10:32.909 --> 00:10:37.559
Caption: leaders in the field and Dykstra says it

00:10:36.088 --> 00:10:39.510
Caption: like this as long as there was no

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:39.900
Caption: machines programming was no problem at

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.109
Caption: all

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.890
Caption: and then we had a few weak computers

00:10:42.109 --> 00:10:44.309
Caption: programming was a little bit of a

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.440
Caption: problem

00:10:44.309 --> 00:10:48.359
Caption: and now we&#39;ve got gigantic computers

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.960
Caption: remember this was 1968 so they were

00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:55.109
Caption: truly massive they they started to have

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.429
Caption: gigantic problems and they they

00:10:55.109 --> 00:10:59.909
Caption: understood that they couldn&#39;t continue

00:10:56.429 --> 00:11:02.510
Caption: the way they were going now they also

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:04.679
Caption: had an idea for the way forward and

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:07.320
Caption: where he said that&#39;s where this quote

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:08.969
Caption: comes from as an indication of what they

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.648
Caption: thought the solution was

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:12.739
Caption: was the NATO software engineering

00:11:10.648 --> 00:11:14.818
Caption: conference in 1968

00:11:12.739 --> 00:11:17.099
Caption: what Dijkstra and the other leaders in

00:11:14.818 --> 00:11:18.599
Caption: the field thought at this stage was

00:11:17.099 --> 00:11:20.039
Caption: we&#39;re going to engineer our way out of

00:11:18.599 --> 00:11:22.258
Caption: this problem we&#39;re going to start to

00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:23.849
Caption: adopt principles and practices from an

00:11:22.258 --> 00:11:25.438
Caption: engineering and that&#39;s going to get us

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:28.828
Caption: forward this is going to solve this big

00:11:25.439 --> 00:11:31.079
Caption: complexity headache we&#39;ve got so that&#39;s

00:11:28.828 --> 00:11:35.099
Caption: what we did we&#39;ve pretended like we were

00:11:31.078 --> 00:11:40.799
Caption: civil engineers building bridges we made

00:11:35.099 --> 00:11:41.938
Caption: plans we we did estimations otherwise

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:44.878
Caption: how are we going to know how much the

00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:46.790
Caption: projects gonna cost then we start to do

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:50.579
Caption: some design and break it down and

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:54.688
Caption: decompose the problem and this was the

00:11:50.578 --> 00:11:56.789
Caption: era of what I call the the engineering

00:11:54.689 --> 00:11:59.009
Caption: year and software and not circus from

00:11:56.789 --> 00:12:02.568
Caption: the late sixties to ad argue the late

00:11:59.008 --> 00:12:05.729
Caption: 90s and it was phenomenally successful

00:12:02.568 --> 00:12:08.188
Caption: everyone bags on waterfall and old ways

00:12:05.729 --> 00:12:09.898
Caption: of doing things but people forget how

00:12:08.189 --> 00:12:12.680
Caption: much progress we made in the software

00:12:09.898 --> 00:12:16.318
Caption: field between 68 and 98 it was massive

00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:17.278
Caption: the thing is it didn&#39;t last right we all

00:12:16.318 --> 00:12:19.888
Caption: know it didn&#39;t last

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:22.799
Caption: eventually the anomaly started to pop up

00:12:19.888 --> 00:12:25.648
Caption: just like in science right the anomaly

00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:27.299
Caption: started to pick up this is a great page

00:12:25.648 --> 00:12:28.859
Caption: on Wikipedia one of my favorites I think

00:12:27.299 --> 00:12:33.448
Caption: it&#39;s my favorite Wikipedia page after

00:12:28.859 --> 00:12:37.018
Caption: the list of cognitive biases this is a

00:12:33.448 --> 00:12:39.568
Caption: Wikipedia page on software failures the

00:12:37.018 --> 00:12:42.359
Caption: projects that are failed in software now

00:12:39.568 --> 00:12:44.458
Caption: this is a small section of part of that

00:12:42.359 --> 00:12:48.448
Caption: page which is about permanent failures

00:12:44.458 --> 00:12:51.299
Caption: basically projects that fail to deliver

00:12:48.448 --> 00:12:52.758
Caption: on any of their outcomes or any of the

00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:55.888
Caption: values that they were expecting to get

00:12:52.758 --> 00:12:57.628
Caption: one of them that&#39;s particularly close to

00:12:55.888 --> 00:12:59.268
Caption: my heart is in the middle there the NHS

00:12:57.629 --> 00:13:02.309
Caption: for connecting health do we have any

00:12:59.268 --> 00:13:03.838
Caption: British people in the audience right so

00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:05.009
Caption: you probably have heard about this too

00:13:03.838 --> 00:13:11.789
Caption: maybe some of you who were on this

00:13:05.008 --> 00:13:15.719
Caption: project I don&#39;t know but here it costs

00:13:11.789 --> 00:13:18.958
Caption: the taxpayers 12 billion pounds 12

00:13:15.719 --> 00:13:21.028
Caption: billion pounds that&#39;s like 20 million

00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.589
Caption: it&#39;s 20 billion dollars I guess

00:13:21.028 --> 00:13:26.028
Caption: something in that ballpark

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:29.700
Caption: could you imagine that amount of money I

00:13:26.028 --> 00:13:32.219
Caption: mean that&#39;s a lot of Apple stock it&#39;s

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:35.520
Caption: really a lot of money and that project

00:13:32.219 --> 00:13:37.409
Caption: failed to deliver any value no I&#39;m

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.480
Caption: pretty sure that they followed all the

00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:42.179
Caption: good engineering practices I&#39;m sure they

00:13:39.479 --> 00:13:44.459
Caption: had estimates I&#39;m sure they had a plan

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:46.409
Caption: I&#39;m sure they had architects drawing

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.540
Caption: good documents I&#39;m sure that they fold

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:51.629
Caption: everything down to the letter and all of

00:13:48.539 --> 00:13:53.880
Caption: the suppliers were CMI level five this

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:55.710
Caption: was this was not a failure of process

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.859
Caption: that this project failed there was

00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:01.170
Caption: something else going on there was other

00:13:58.859 --> 00:14:02.489
Caption: kind of anomalies cropping up too there

00:14:01.169 --> 00:14:05.849
Caption: was open source

00:14:02.489 --> 00:14:09.659
Caption: you know Linux and different ways of

00:14:05.849 --> 00:14:11.459
Caption: working like XP which were showing how

00:14:09.659 --> 00:14:13.829
Caption: you could succeed without following any

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.900
Caption: of that engineering nonsense without

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.820
Caption: having requirements without having

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:20.369
Caption: design documents without being

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.750
Caption: co-located using volunteers there was

00:14:20.369 --> 00:14:23.150
Caption: all kinds of ways you could make

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.559
Caption: software that didn&#39;t fit this

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:29.550
Caption: engineering practice it&#39;s only scale to

00:14:25.559 --> 00:14:31.500
Caption: very very large projects so we had these

00:14:29.549 --> 00:14:33.390
Caption: two kinds of anomalies really starting

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.210
Caption: to creep up and they&#39;re coming to a head

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:38.220
Caption: during the late 90s and we have this

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.260
Caption: crisis and a lot of the leaders in the

00:14:38.219 --> 00:14:42.719
Caption: field at this stage we&#39;re saying well

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.119
Caption: hold on maybe we&#39;ve got the wrong idea

00:14:42.719 --> 00:14:46.500
Caption: maybe we&#39;ve got the wrong you know

00:14:45.119 --> 00:14:50.429
Caption: paradigm maybe we have the wrong

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:52.979
Caption: fundamentals for a field what if just

00:14:50.429 --> 00:14:57.119
Caption: what if we&#39;re not civil engineers making

00:14:52.979 --> 00:15:00.299
Caption: bridges what if instead were working on

00:14:57.119 --> 00:15:03.900
Caption: the factory floor making Toyota&#39;s would

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:07.049
Caption: not be a different story it&#39;s a lot less

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.600
Caption: glamorous isn&#39;t it but it&#39;s maybe closer

00:15:07.049 --> 00:15:12.869
Caption: to the truth

00:15:08.599 --> 00:15:15.359
Caption: so eventually these leaders who were

00:15:12.869 --> 00:15:17.130
Caption: more or less arguing through all the 90s

00:15:15.359 --> 00:15:19.739
Caption: about the best way to make software got

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.940
Caption: together and Snowbird and figured out

00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:22.880
Caption: well at least there were some things

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:27.088
Caption: they could agree on and they got the

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:29.429
Caption: manifesto for agile software and this

00:15:27.088 --> 00:15:33.208
Caption: was quite revolutionary at the change at

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:35.039
Caption: the time live a little bit later

00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:37.229
Caption: required

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:40.349
Caption: some more information because the the

00:15:37.229 --> 00:15:43.380
Caption: values of the manifesto weren&#39;t enough

00:15:40.349 --> 00:15:44.909
Caption: for people so a little bit later they

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:48.479
Caption: came with some principles behind the

00:15:44.909 --> 00:15:50.909
Caption: agile manifesto the very first principle

00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:53.940
Caption: and they also state the highest priority

00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:56.009
Caption: is to satisfy the customer with early

00:15:53.940 --> 00:16:01.710
Caption: and continuous delivery of valuable

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:05.340
Caption: software now this is 2002 what we have

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:07.020
Caption: here is a theory that if we can satisfy

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:09.150
Caption: the customer with early and continuous

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:11.820
Caption: delivery of software it will lead to

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:14.400
Caption: better outcomes this is a theory it

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:17.760
Caption: sounds good but at the time there was a

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.220
Caption: lot of pushback people found it hard to

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.400
Caption: give up the old paradigm but still we

00:16:20.219 --> 00:16:25.589
Caption: had a theory the thing is a theory is

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.570
Caption: not enough to get a revolution if we go

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:30.090
Caption: back to and the structure of

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:32.580
Caption: scientific revolutions you can&#39;t get a

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:35.010
Caption: revolution just for theory you need

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.350
Caption: achievements too and the achievements

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.520
Caption: ones that have to be sufficiently

00:16:36.349 --> 00:16:41.750
Caption: unprecedented something that could not

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:44.070
Caption: have been done with the old paradigm and

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:46.830
Caption: secondly they have to be sufficiently

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:50.729
Caption: open-ended and that&#39;s because in order

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:53.730
Caption: to get to like spark a new paradigm a

00:16:50.729 --> 00:16:57.239
Caption: revolution you need to get people in

00:16:53.729 --> 00:17:00.269
Caption: your field into it now smart people are

00:16:57.239 --> 00:17:02.279
Caption: not interested in solutions and I know

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:04.770
Caption: you&#39;re all smart people what we&#39;re

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:06.390
Caption: interested in our problems we get

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.010
Caption: attracted to problems because we want to

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:12.979
Caption: go and solve problems that&#39;s why we do

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:17.280
Caption: what we do so we needed unprecedented

00:17:12.979 --> 00:17:17.760
Caption: achievements and open-ended problems to

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.420
Caption: solve

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:23.578
Caption: I think Part B was solved at the stage

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:27.270
Caption: of the agile manifesto but there wasn&#39;t

00:17:23.578 --> 00:17:31.770
Caption: any really big successes with agile for

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:35.250
Caption: quite a while actually and I would say

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:37.320
Caption: it wasn&#39;t until we started to see what I

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:39.030
Caption: guess we could call the second growth of

00:17:37.319 --> 00:17:42.719
Caption: Silicon Valley when we started to get a

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:44.910
Caption: lot more companies having what we s we

00:17:42.719 --> 00:17:46.409
Caption: call unicorns these days having great

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.359
Caption: success at delivering software

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.729
Caption: continuously and frequently

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:52.558
Caption: and I think Flickr was the kind of the

00:17:50.729 --> 00:17:54.780
Caption: vanguard of this when they were talking

00:17:52.558 --> 00:17:57.719
Caption: about ten deploys per day at the

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.130
Caption: velocity conference in 2009 and very

00:17:57.719 --> 00:18:03.209
Caption: shortly after that we&#39;ve got this term

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:04.798
Caption: DevOps and DevOps days and we started to

00:18:03.209 --> 00:18:08.159
Caption: get more and more literature the Phoenix

00:18:04.798 --> 00:18:09.839
Caption: project there was a lot more there was a

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.450
Caption: lot more success people were having

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:18.419
Caption: great success by following these agile

00:18:12.449 --> 00:18:20.219
Caption: manifesto principles so we have a theory

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.510
Caption: and we start to have some achievements

00:18:20.219 --> 00:18:25.260
Caption: we&#39;ve still got a lot of problems to

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:26.760
Caption: solve part of the problems we have is

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.829
Caption: that we don&#39;t have the tools to do

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.808
Caption: continuous delivery continuous delivery

00:18:28.829 --> 00:18:33.269
Caption: is a great idea we can write it down in

00:18:30.808 --> 00:18:35.760
Caption: a manifesto but how do we actually

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:39.869
Caption: deliver continuously to the customer it

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:42.239
Caption: requires an awful lot of tooling and the

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:44.609
Caption: good news is that as software engineers

00:18:42.239 --> 00:18:47.939
Caption: where we love making tools sometimes a

00:18:44.609 --> 00:18:49.890
Caption: little bit too much we can see that the

00:18:47.939 --> 00:18:51.808
Caption: same story played out in software

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:54.119
Caption: without the telescope we couldn&#39;t have

00:18:51.808 --> 00:18:56.640
Caption: kepler&#39;s tables and we wouldn&#39;t have

00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:57.678
Caption: been able to get Isaac Newton&#39;s

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.140
Caption: principles

00:18:57.678 --> 00:19:04.529
Caption: it&#39;s just simple that you need the tools

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.510
Caption: plus the data to get the theory they all

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:09.900
Caption: go together

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:13.440
Caption: same thing with evolution if we hadn&#39;t

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:17.150
Caption: been able to make ocean-going voyages if

00:19:13.439 --> 00:19:19.439
Caption: we didn&#39;t have the expedition where

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:21.030
Caption: Darwin went and collected all the data

00:19:19.439 --> 00:19:23.069
Caption: and started to see the differences

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:26.460
Caption: between different islands we would never

00:19:23.069 --> 00:19:28.139
Caption: have had the theory of evolution now it

00:19:26.459 --> 00:19:31.079
Caption: doesn&#39;t need to go in that order you

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:33.390
Caption: don&#39;t have to have the fear the the the

00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:35.159
Caption: tools and the data to capture the theory

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.200
Caption: sometimes you get the theory first and

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.440
Caption: that&#39;s especially true in physics

00:19:37.199 --> 00:19:43.229
Caption: because physics you have applied and non

00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:46.639
Caption: applied physics experimental and so on

00:19:43.229 --> 00:19:51.329
Caption: so the Higgs mechanism was actually

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:52.890
Caption: postulated in 1964 it was almost like 50

00:19:51.329 --> 00:19:55.229
Caption: years later when we actually got

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:58.849
Caption: anywhere to proving it and that was

00:19:55.229 --> 00:20:02.479
Caption: because we didn&#39;t have the tools or the

00:19:58.849 --> 00:20:05.510
Caption: the data but with CERN we got the Large

00:20:02.479 --> 00:20:07.130
Caption: Hadron Collider we got the tool and then

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.349
Caption: the experiments produce the data that

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:13.609
Caption: actually proved that the Higgs field was

00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:15.380
Caption: there so we need tools and we need data

00:20:13.609 --> 00:20:19.359
Caption: to be able to sustain a theory and get

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:21.770
Caption: that revolution well telescope we got

00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:24.979
Caption: the Beagle expedition we&#39;ve got a large

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:27.459
Caption: hi John Collider experiments now agile

00:20:24.979 --> 00:20:30.410
Caption: has this theory the theory is that agile

00:20:27.459 --> 00:20:34.069
Caption: approaches agile practices will improve

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:37.220
Caption: your business outcomes but where are the

00:20:34.069 --> 00:20:39.199
Caption: tools to help to implement not and

00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:42.650
Caption: where&#39;s the data to show that that&#39;s

00:20:39.199 --> 00:20:44.329
Caption: actually true there&#39;s no at least in the

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:48.940
Caption: the first decade of this century there

00:20:44.329 --> 00:20:52.579
Caption: was mostly just anecdote at this stage

00:20:48.939 --> 00:20:54.529
Caption: but as software engineers we started

00:20:52.579 --> 00:20:56.269
Caption: building tools we started to understand

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:58.580
Caption: that there&#39;s a lot of things in

00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:01.010
Caption: continuous delivery that we can automate

00:20:58.579 --> 00:21:04.159
Caption: and more or less everything that happens

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:06.260
Caption: after you&#39;re done with your work to it

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:09.859
Caption: being delivered to the customer should

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:11.930
Caption: be automated I you don&#39;t want to be

00:21:09.859 --> 00:21:13.250
Caption: building your software manually you

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.710
Caption: don&#39;t wanna be testing yourself we&#39;re

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:17.719
Caption: manually you don&#39;t want to be producing

00:21:15.709 --> 00:21:21.890
Caption: your documentation and your compliance

00:21:17.719 --> 00:21:25.280
Caption: manually you want to have that all like

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:27.109
Caption: it&#39;s a fixed steady repeatable process

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.859
Caption: and we built lots and lots of tooling

00:21:27.109 --> 00:21:32.839
Caption: around us ideally you can think of any

00:21:30.859 --> 00:21:35.979
Caption: technology organization as some kind of

00:21:32.839 --> 00:21:38.689
Caption: meat machine whose purpose is to take

00:21:35.979 --> 00:21:42.380
Caption: customer or business needs and deliver

00:21:38.689 --> 00:21:44.389
Caption: them it&#39;s a change delivery organization

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:46.670
Caption: that&#39;s why technology organizations

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:49.070
Caption: exist so everything you can do to make

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:53.150
Caption: that smoother and use the tooling which

00:21:49.069 --> 00:21:55.399
Caption: is a good good investment so a quick

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:59.479
Caption: question how many people are using some

00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:01.190
Caption: of these tools right nearly I guess all

00:21:59.479 --> 00:22:03.510
Caption: of you right and I&#39;m sorry if there&#39;s

00:22:01.189 --> 00:22:06.659
Caption: any COBOL people here

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:08.729
Caption: but I mean the other good side of being

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.260
Caption: a software engineer is that we&#39;re not

00:22:08.729 --> 00:22:12.359
Caption: only good at making tools but really

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:16.770
Caption: good adopting them all of these tools I

00:22:12.359 --> 00:22:18.959
Caption: think maybe yeah in the last 10 years

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:21.000
Caption: all of these tools were made in the last

00:22:18.959 --> 00:22:25.380
Caption: 10 years I think that&#39;s a true statement

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.239
Caption: and I think that nearly every software

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.190
Caption: project is using some combination of

00:22:27.239 --> 00:22:33.929
Caption: these tools at this stage so we&#39;re good

00:22:29.189 --> 00:22:35.609
Caption: at this we&#39;re good at retooling and of

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.590
Caption: course we have to change a little bit as

00:22:35.609 --> 00:22:39.839
Caption: well we need to get our everybody and

00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:43.439
Caption: the teams we don&#39;t want to have silos

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:46.529
Caption: and so on we want to automate good so we

00:22:43.439 --> 00:22:48.689
Caption: have the tools we can adopt them but

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:50.280
Caption: where&#39;s the data we need to back this up

00:22:48.689 --> 00:22:53.189
Caption: we can&#39;t just pretend that we know what

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.680
Caption: we&#39;re talking about thankfully there&#39;s

00:22:53.189 --> 00:22:57.989
Caption: been a lot of work over the last five or

00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:00.360
Caption: so years by the DevOps research and

00:22:57.989 --> 00:23:04.829
Caption: assessments company led by Nicole

00:23:00.359 --> 00:23:08.280
Caption: four-screen and gene Kim and Jess humble

00:23:04.829 --> 00:23:11.010
Caption: sorry and they&#39;ve been doing an awful

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.570
Caption: lot of data gathering and they do an

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.369
Caption: annual survey of thousands of IT

00:23:12.569 --> 00:23:18.299
Caption: professionals have any of you

00:23:14.369 --> 00:23:20.309
Caption: participated in this year&#39;s survey a few

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.980
Caption: so this is really important for our

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:28.050
Caption: industry because this is the first kind

00:23:22.979 --> 00:23:30.000
Caption: of steps towards us becoming more

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:32.430
Caption: professional in what we&#39;re doing it&#39;s

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.949
Caption: about gathering data from our industry

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.600
Caption: to see what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not

00:23:33.949 --> 00:23:38.459
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of talk and conferences

00:23:36.599 --> 00:23:40.949
Caption: about what&#39;s working what&#39;s not I tried

00:23:38.459 --> 00:23:42.929
Caption: this you tried that it&#39;s fine we&#39;re

00:23:40.949 --> 00:23:44.939
Caption: getting a lot of ideas but at some stage

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:48.630
Caption: we need to get some numbers and see

00:23:44.939 --> 00:23:50.339
Caption: what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not so with

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.900
Caption: with the state of DevOps report what

00:23:50.339 --> 00:23:53.339
Caption: they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re taking all the

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.859
Caption: data they&#39;re getting from these survey

00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:58.679
Caption: responses and they&#39;re publishing it for

00:23:55.859 --> 00:24:00.449
Caption: free and an a report but the most

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:03.570
Caption: important thing is that everything about

00:24:00.449 --> 00:24:08.099
Caption: it is based on rigorous scientific

00:24:03.569 --> 00:24:11.399
Caption: method of course what they&#39;re finding is

00:24:08.099 --> 00:24:13.199
Caption: that there&#39;s a big difference between IT

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.599
Caption: organizations there&#39;s high performers

00:24:13.199 --> 00:24:16.889
Caption: and low performers as anyone surprised

00:24:15.599 --> 00:24:19.439
Caption: by the fact that there&#39;s high

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.719
Caption: performers in low performers in IT no

00:24:19.439 --> 00:24:24.750
Caption: I&#39;m not either

00:24:20.719 --> 00:24:26.520
Caption: but equally what&#39;s fun is that they give

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:29.310
Caption: you some real numbers so you can see

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.739
Caption: where on the performance kind of

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:33.960
Caption: spectrum your organization is falling

00:24:31.739 --> 00:24:39.420
Caption: and what you should be focusing on to

00:24:33.959 --> 00:24:42.239
Caption: get there now this is the most shall I

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:44.010
Caption: say for me this is the most important

00:24:42.239 --> 00:24:46.349
Caption: aspect of the state of DevOps report

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:49.290
Caption: it&#39;s about 50 pages and this is the one

00:24:46.349 --> 00:24:51.299
Caption: diagram and at which I think is the

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:52.950
Caption: where the the guts of the value are

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.560
Caption: coming out because what this is showing

00:24:52.949 --> 00:24:58.619
Caption: is from their data

00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:02.370
Caption: what is predictive of financial outcomes

00:24:58.619 --> 00:25:04.979
Caption: and an organization so let me just

00:25:02.369 --> 00:25:07.349
Caption: simplify this a little bit so over on

00:25:04.979 --> 00:25:08.819
Caption: the far right it&#39;s it&#39;s all about the

00:25:07.349 --> 00:25:11.400
Caption: money right what are the financial

00:25:08.819 --> 00:25:15.479
Caption: outcomes for the business in terms of

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:17.219
Caption: like your organization your company how

00:25:15.479 --> 00:25:18.449
Caption: did they but how did they perform on the

00:25:17.219 --> 00:25:20.159
Caption: stock market last year

00:25:18.449 --> 00:25:22.169
Caption: that&#39;s how are they figuring they&#39;re

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.859
Caption: correlating or actually more than

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:27.780
Caption: correlating they&#39;re associating

00:25:24.859 --> 00:25:30.660
Caption: financial outcomes with IT performance

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:33.450
Caption: of the company so what they found is

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.880
Caption: that there are two key things that are

00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:38.489
Caption: predictive of positive or negative

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:41.010
Caption: financial outcomes and that&#39;s whether

00:25:38.489 --> 00:25:44.189
Caption: your company is adopting lean product

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:46.410
Caption: management practices and whether you&#39;re

00:25:44.189 --> 00:25:47.849
Caption: able to do continuous delivery or to the

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:50.880
Caption: extent that what you&#39;re doing continuous

00:25:47.849 --> 00:25:53.549
Caption: delivery so those two things and your IT

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:56.609
Caption: organization are actually predictive of

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:58.410
Caption: a financial performance of your company

00:25:56.609 --> 00:25:59.939
Caption: now that&#39;s important that&#39;s the first

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:04.020
Caption: very very important outcome from this

00:25:59.939 --> 00:26:06.479
Caption: research the other the other thing is

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:10.109
Caption: that it goes more into the individual

00:26:06.479 --> 00:26:12.150
Caption: practices and that are required to get

00:26:10.109 --> 00:26:13.949
Caption: there and what they found of course is

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:16.200
Caption: that if you don&#39;t have transformational

00:26:13.949 --> 00:26:18.449
Caption: leadership at the very foundation of all

00:26:16.199 --> 00:26:21.329
Caption: you&#39;re doing then none of the rest will

00:26:18.449 --> 00:26:23.609
Caption: happen if if your leadership team isn&#39;t

00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:26.039
Caption: behind gleen practices isn&#39;t behind

00:26:23.609 --> 00:26:27.299
Caption: developing technical excellence adopting

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.410
Caption: practices and tools to make your

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.239
Caption: organization

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:35.729
Caption: excellent technically

00:26:30.239 --> 00:26:37.530
Caption: then you&#39;re going to struggle now you

00:26:35.729 --> 00:26:41.939
Caption: don&#39;t have to survey thousands of people

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:44.880
Caption: to figure out what your what you&#39;re

00:26:41.939 --> 00:26:46.859
Caption: doing where you are and how you&#39;re

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.979
Caption: improving or getting worse some very

00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:53.000
Caption: very simple things actually there&#39;s four

00:26:48.979 --> 00:26:56.549
Caption: key if I go back here there&#39;s four key

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.550
Caption: shall we say IT metrics that are

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:02.270
Caption: completely predictive predictive not

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:05.489
Caption: just correlated but predictive of

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:08.339
Caption: business performance and that&#39;s your

00:27:05.489 --> 00:27:10.890
Caption: deployment frequency how often you can

00:27:08.339 --> 00:27:13.650
Caption: make changes to production the lead time

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:15.709
Caption: for changes once a change is ready how

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:18.630
Caption: long does it take to get to the customer

00:27:15.709 --> 00:27:20.819
Caption: your mean time to recover we all fail

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.670
Caption: but how long does it take you to figure

00:27:20.819 --> 00:27:25.558
Caption: out and recover from it and then your

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:27.359
Caption: change failure rate how often does

00:27:25.558 --> 00:27:29.969
Caption: something fail in production when you

00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:31.979
Caption: change it so those only those four

00:27:29.969 --> 00:27:34.520
Caption: metrics are they&#39;re the only four

00:27:31.979 --> 00:27:38.579
Caption: metrics you need to capture to

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:39.630
Caption: understand your IT performance and these

00:27:38.579 --> 00:27:41.369
Caption: are the ones that you should be

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.770
Caption: optimizing for if you care about

00:27:41.369 --> 00:27:46.410
Caption: performance now of course you need to go

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:49.020
Caption: through a lot of these other practices

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:51.929
Caption: to get better at those numbers but at

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:56.880
Caption: least those four numbers are shown to be

00:27:51.928 --> 00:28:00.349
Caption: predictive of financial outcomes very

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:03.349
Caption: simple one you can measure most of those

00:28:00.349 --> 00:28:06.689
Caption: actually all those four measures can be

00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:11.780
Caption: measured from your incident system your

00:28:06.689 --> 00:28:14.669
Caption: your CIA deployment system and your task

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:17.160
Caption: management system you probably already

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:20.280
Caption: have this data you just need to find a

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.869
Caption: way to get out and monitoring you can

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:27.570
Caption: even just do it manually once a month

00:28:21.869 --> 00:28:30.449
Caption: that&#39;s good enough one thing that I find

00:28:27.569 --> 00:28:31.619
Caption: is very important is that most of us is

00:28:30.449 --> 00:28:36.178
Caption: there anyone in the room that&#39;s not a

00:28:31.619 --> 00:28:39.030
Caption: developer right so I&#39;m going to speak to

00:28:36.178 --> 00:28:41.789
Caption: the developers for a second because what

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:43.869
Caption: I find is that if you take a value

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:47.109
Caption: stream from a customer need to be

00:28:43.869 --> 00:28:49.058
Caption: delivered developers are in this very

00:28:47.109 --> 00:28:50.770
Caption: small box there&#39;s a whole bunch of stuff

00:28:49.058 --> 00:28:52.329
Caption: that happens before the work starts and

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:54.250
Caption: there&#39;s a whole bunch of stuff that

00:28:52.329 --> 00:28:55.989
Caption: normally has to happen afterwards and

00:28:54.250 --> 00:29:02.079
Caption: this is especially true in regulated

00:28:55.989 --> 00:29:03.670
Caption: environments so you need to get you need

00:29:02.079 --> 00:29:05.979
Caption: to start to think about your whole value

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:07.930
Caption: stream get everybody that&#39;s involved in

00:29:05.979 --> 00:29:11.199
Caption: your software delivery chain your IT

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:13.000
Caption: operations your compliance everybody get

00:29:11.199 --> 00:29:14.769
Caption: them all involved and map out your full

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.959
Caption: value stream because there&#39;s no point in

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:18.640
Caption: doing local optimizations it&#39;s not going

00:29:16.959 --> 00:29:22.089
Caption: to help you need to think about the

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:23.558
Caption: whole right I know I&#39;m running a little

00:29:22.089 --> 00:29:24.760
Caption: bit late so I&#39;ll just I just want to

00:29:23.558 --> 00:29:27.760
Caption: wrap up real quick with a couple of

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:30.729
Caption: thoughts to take away with it the first

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:33.849
Caption: is a fantastic book by Andy Grove Andy

00:29:30.729 --> 00:29:36.640
Caption: Grove was the CEO of Intel he&#39;s

00:29:33.849 --> 00:29:38.020
Caption: considered to be one of the best tech

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:41.619
Caption: leaders of all time

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:43.540
Caption: he took Intel from being primarily and

00:29:41.619 --> 00:29:46.178
Caption: the memory business to being primarily

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:49.390
Caption: and the CPU business and not required

00:29:46.178 --> 00:29:51.189
Caption: completely changing the organization it

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.079
Caption: was a real transformation and this book

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:55.928
Caption: tells that story only the paranoid

00:29:53.079 --> 00:29:57.519
Caption: survive in the book he has this very

00:29:55.928 --> 00:29:59.909
Caption: very key idea about the strategic

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:03.640
Caption: inflection point where we&#39;re starting a

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:05.050
Caption: feed state and the memory business you

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.729
Caption: know it was getting eaten and eating and

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:09.090
Caption: eating the the prices were going down

00:30:06.729 --> 00:30:11.558
Caption: the competition was becoming fiercer and

00:30:09.089 --> 00:30:13.150
Caption: frankly the Japanese manufacturers were

00:30:11.558 --> 00:30:15.159
Caption: making better and cheaper memory than

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:17.520
Caption: Intel were and he understood that if he

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:20.070
Caption: kept fighting in that fight

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:23.050
Caption: Intel would no longer exist as a company

00:30:20.069 --> 00:30:25.119
Caption: but what he also saw was that if we had

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:28.630
Caption: this we have a chance now to get on to

00:30:25.119 --> 00:30:31.449
Caption: the next the next technology and that

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:33.369
Caption: was CPUs and they did that and Intel

00:30:31.449 --> 00:30:35.678
Caption: became phenomenally successful because

00:30:33.369 --> 00:30:37.390
Caption: of it but it was an extremely hard

00:30:35.678 --> 00:30:39.339
Caption: journey so this idea of strategic

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:41.739
Caption: inflection points is really important

00:30:39.339 --> 00:30:44.529
Caption: and I think that digitalization of

00:30:41.739 --> 00:30:46.479
Caption: traditional industries as other

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:49.380
Caption: traditional industries are facing

00:30:46.479 --> 00:30:51.640
Caption: similar inflection points where banks

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:53.890
Caption: manufacturing health care insurance

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.630
Caption: they&#39;re all facing these same problems

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.940
Caption: because those that are digitalizing and

00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.599
Caption: getting you data are doing

00:30:56.939 --> 00:31:02.159
Caption: much better so the future is here this

00:31:00.599 --> 00:31:03.150
Caption: is good news there&#39;s lots of people who

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.460
Caption: have already done a lot of the hard

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:06.599
Caption: learning you don&#39;t want to be the first

00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:09.750
Caption: to adopt stuff

00:31:06.599 --> 00:31:12.599
Caption: don&#39;t run sto in production just yet for

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:14.459
Caption: instance you definitely don&#39;t want to be

00:31:12.599 --> 00:31:16.140
Caption: the last to adopt either because your

00:31:14.459 --> 00:31:18.449
Caption: company is probably going to get out of

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.810
Caption: business you want to optimize for

00:31:18.449 --> 00:31:23.130
Caption: throughput plan for replace ability and

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:25.080
Caption: learn from the community come to events

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:29.310
Caption: like this learn and find out what other

00:31:25.079 --> 00:31:30.959
Caption: people are doing so yeah that&#39;s it I

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:33.000
Caption: think that DevOps does define our

00:31:30.959 --> 00:31:36.390
Caption: paradigm I think that there is a staff

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.849
Caption: consensus that agile is the theory that

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:41.250
Caption: is the foundation of this new paradigm

00:31:38.849 --> 00:31:42.929
Caption: nobody&#39;s going back to civil engineer

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:45.569
Caption: approaches to software development

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:47.880
Caption: unless you&#39;re making software for

00:31:45.569 --> 00:31:50.159
Caption: missiles and so on maybe you want to do

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:51.810
Caption: that but for everyone else

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.700
Caption: nobody&#39;s going back we&#39;re only going

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:55.950
Caption: forward so agile was the theory

00:31:53.699 --> 00:31:58.439
Caption: DevOps continuous delivery or practices

00:31:55.949 --> 00:32:00.419
Caption: that underpin it and now it&#39;s time to

00:31:58.439 --> 00:32:02.909
Caption: prove it and show the value of these

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:05.100
Caption: changes by gathering the data adopting

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:07.369
Caption: the tools and getting really really

00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:11.189
Caption: strong in our technical excellence

00:32:07.369 --> 00:32:12.689
Caption: so yeah science it works thanks very

00:32:11.189 --> 00:32:16.439
Caption: much for giving me your lunch break and

00:32:12.689 --> 00:32:19.259
Caption: if you have to we have no time for

00:32:16.439 --> 00:32:21.419
Caption: questions I&#39;m unfortunately but I&#39;ll be

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.739
Caption: around all day and at the after-party so

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.930
Caption: if you want to talk more about any of

00:32:22.739 --> 00:32:25.469
Caption: these ideas please come over and talk to

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:29.470
Caption: me

00:32:25.469 --> 00:32:31.530
Caption: [Applause]

00:32:29.469 --> 00:32:31.530
Caption: you
