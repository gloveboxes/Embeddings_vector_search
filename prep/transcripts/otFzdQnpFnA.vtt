Caption: but without sponsors then they&#39;re

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:29.279

Caption: going over today what can go wrong which

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:45.899
Caption: may lead to financial loss what we can

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.579

Caption: talk about

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.979

Caption: wrong

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:16.738
Caption: so

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.158
Caption: I was trying to put the talk together

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:22.139
Caption: I&#39;ve got swen uh who&#39;s our you know my

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:24.059

Caption: talk at conferences so what&#39;s a nice

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:29.339
Caption: topical generic subject we can speak

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.018
Caption: about in order to educate and you know

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:32.699
Caption: not be too deep and intimidating I&#39;m

00:03:31.018 --> 00:03:35.759
Caption: like well let&#39;s talk about Sim swapping

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:37.679
Caption: has anyone heard of sim swapping

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:39.720
Caption: manual

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:41.279
Caption: all right so just imagine you&#39;re holding

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.018
Caption: your phone scrolling through Tick Tock

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.580
Caption: and sitting there waiting for the bus or

00:03:43.018 --> 00:03:46.679
Caption: whatever and then all of a sudden your

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.059
Caption: data stops and then you look at the top

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:50.878
Caption: and instead of it saying Optus or

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:53.039
Caption: Telstra or Vodafone it says SOS

00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:54.958
Caption: that&#39;s the experience you&#39;ll receive

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:57.419
Caption: when you&#39;ve been Sim swapped essentially

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:59.279
Caption: what a Sim swap is is someone

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.259
Caption: fraudulently pretends to be you and

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:04.860
Caption: steals your phone number

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:06.539
Caption: all right so why do they do that most

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.158
Caption: banks are pretty sucky with their

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:10.139
Caption: security sorry Banks and specially

00:04:08.158 --> 00:04:11.938
Caption: Bankwest being a sponsor but like you

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.878
Caption: know your MFA

00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:17.518
Caption: normally is SMS with a bank so if you

00:04:14.878 --> 00:04:19.799
Caption: own the phone number then they can

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.199
Caption: pretty much say that they&#39;re you verify

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.919
Caption: money transfers

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.080
Caption: um

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.179
Caption: the other reason why Sim swaps can be

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:29.399
Caption: somewhat effective is especially on a

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:31.859
Caption: prepaid service you don&#39;t need a lot of

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:34.019
Caption: information to do a Sim swap

00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:36.239
Caption: so I thought I&#39;d do a Sim swap on myself

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:37.739
Caption: I did it with a prepaid that I

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:39.959
Caption: registered and then I got another

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:44.699
Caption: prepaid sim I&#39;m not going to do it with

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:46.679
Caption: my details but um basically you can see

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.320
Caption: here this is the number

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:52.079
Caption: and I needed to know these two things

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.839
Caption: right so these can be found reasonably

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:56.220
Caption: easy like if a hacker was doing this

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:58.139
Caption: you&#39;d assume that they&#39;ve already

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.299
Caption: compromised you in some way probably

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.839
Caption: I&#39;ve got your email box there&#39;s like a

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:05.519
Caption: statistic like 98.9 of gmails do not

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:08.220
Caption: have two-factor authentication turned on

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:10.679
Caption: them right and

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.679
Caption: there&#39;s an odds odds are a lot of people

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:15.539
Caption: are quite sucky with their passwords and

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:17.940
Caption: reuse passwords and we&#39;ll talk about

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.199
Caption: that in a little while but um so to do a

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.259
Caption: Sim swap you need to know a phone number

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:25.500
Caption: and you need to know the provider

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:27.500
Caption: and then all you need to do is have an

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.940
Caption: ID type so for

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.619
Caption: circles.life you need to have either a

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.479
Caption: driver&#39;s license a Medicare card or a

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:35.279
Caption: passport number but they don&#39;t actually

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.539
Caption: verify that you just need to know the

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:40.559
Caption: number

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:42.239
Caption: right so there&#39;s my license number

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:43.979
Caption: but you know because it&#39;s so easy I&#39;m

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:46.019
Caption: not going to give it to you there&#39;s my

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.119
Caption: first name my middle name shown on my

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:51.000
Caption: license my last name

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:52.440
Caption: then you need the date of birth

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.880
Caption: but if you&#39;ve got the license number

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.339
Caption: you&#39;ve probably got the date of birth

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.779
Caption: right like an attacker is going to be

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.459
Caption: prepared they&#39;re not going to be like

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:02.220
Caption: some schmuck like me trying to simulate

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:03.839
Caption: it for your benefit so you know and you

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.139
Caption: need the email but once you&#39;ve got that

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:08.940
Caption: like to me that&#39;s not a very high bar if

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.020
Caption: you&#39;re able to compromise someone&#39;s

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.979
Caption: email

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:15.839
Caption: and then you verify it with a code sent

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.399
Caption: to the email it&#39;s blurrier than I

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:20.039
Caption: thought it would be sorry

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:22.579
Caption: um but then that initiates the um the

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.579
Caption: Sim swap

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:28.500
Caption: so that was the text I got

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:31.319
Caption: um that was the the validation of the ID

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.179
Caption: but you saw that was all of the

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:34.859
Caption: information I gave them so you don&#39;t

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:36.779
Caption: need the physical ID you just need the

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:38.279
Caption: information and I know that like in the

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.660
Caption: past when I&#39;ve traveled say overseas

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.880
Caption: I&#39;ve um

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.339
Caption: taken a scan of important documents just

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.559
Caption: so I don&#39;t lose it if in case you know I

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:49.019
Caption: lose it I can prove who I am so I

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:50.699
Caption: haven&#39;t deleted that I don&#39;t know how

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:53.160
Caption: long people have had the same mailbox

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:54.899
Caption: but I&#39;ve had some for 15 years and

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.839
Caption: that&#39;s got a lot of Pi in it and if I

00:06:54.899 --> 00:07:00.500
Caption: lost access then I&#39;d lose it

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:00.500
Caption: so

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:06.539
Caption: so you may ask why you should care about

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:09.899
Caption: this and what does all of this have to

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:12.000
Caption: do with you as a consumer well as

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:13.319
Caption: consumers we need to protect ourselves

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.179
Caption: against

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:17.579
Caption: hackers

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:19.500
Caption: what that was meant to be humorous but

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:22.019
Caption: never mind

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.359
Caption: so next up we are going to talk about

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:26.819
Caption: potential attack vectors which may lead

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:28.978
Caption: to account compromise

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:31.559
Caption: there are many websites that have been

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:33.660
Caption: compromised try hand Publishers a site

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:35.819
Caption: you can use to see which one of your

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.580
Caption: accounts have been compromised if they

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:40.559
Caption: are so this is a very popular website

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:43.138
Caption: called have I been pawned we actually

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:46.019
Caption: use this at the Cohen University for our

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:48.479
Caption: cyber security workshops as well and

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:50.399
Caption: just simply in your sorry just simply

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:52.139
Caption: key in your email address or your phone

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:53.940
Caption: number and this website tells you

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:56.399
Caption: whether or not it has been compromised

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.739
Caption: and how many instances that has happened

00:07:56.399 --> 00:08:00.359
Caption: so this website keeps a database of

00:07:58.739 --> 00:08:02.519
Caption: accounts with their credentials

00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:03.258
Caption: compromised as you can see here there

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:06.899
Caption: are

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:08.399
Caption: 626 websites hacked 11 billion accounts

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:11.759
Caption: breached and

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:15.419
Caption: I don&#39;t know what those two are but yeah

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:17.880
Caption: password reuse so even if you secure the

00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:20.339
Caption: data well the user might just give it

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.279
Caption: away with poor password hygiene

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:24.959
Caption: so can we have a show of hands of how

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:28.339
Caption: many people here we use the same

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:31.079
Caption: password across multiple sites

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:33.179
Caption: ah ah

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:36.778
Caption: wait I want to know who those are I want

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:39.239
Caption: to hack you oh wait sorry about that uh

00:08:36.778 --> 00:08:41.760
Caption: so anyway

00:08:39.239 --> 00:08:44.700
Caption: according to this website dataprod.net

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.220
Caption: on average the same password is used to

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.919
Caption: access five different accounts which

00:08:47.219 --> 00:08:51.419
Caption: like I said I wanted to hack you guys so

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:53.159
Caption: if you could just write down your

00:08:51.419 --> 00:08:55.919
Caption: credentials and put it over here I would

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:58.259
Caption: very much appreciate that

00:08:55.919 --> 00:09:00.659
Caption: I&#39;m sure this has been enforced in a lot

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.760
Caption: of account logins especially in

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:06.299
Caption: organizations multi-factor

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:09.059
Caption: authentication or MFA when you develop

00:09:06.299 --> 00:09:11.099
Caption: an application encourage or enforce your

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:12.419
Caption: users to register for multi-factor

00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:14.458
Caption: Authentication

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:17.219
Caption: ideally you do not build your own

00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:19.619
Caption: authentication process but leverage an

00:09:17.219 --> 00:09:22.379
Caption: authentication provider that manages the

00:09:19.619 --> 00:09:24.299
Caption: user accounts securely and provides a

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.700
Caption: secure authentication process with

00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:29.518
Caption: two-factor Authentication

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.799
Caption: hyperscalers all allow for it for

00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:34.739
Caption: example Azure and other dedicated

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:37.018
Caption: providers providers for authentication

00:09:34.739 --> 00:09:40.018
Caption: like r0 who has their Booth right

00:09:37.018 --> 00:09:41.820
Caption: outside or Microsoft authenticator and

00:09:40.018 --> 00:09:44.639
Caption: so on

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.739
Caption: just don&#39;t use SMS for MFA how because

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.540
Caption: we&#39;ve already proven something kind of a

00:09:46.739 --> 00:09:51.479
Caption: sucky method right

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:52.979
Caption: so uh dependency hell uh when you write

00:09:51.479 --> 00:09:55.559
Caption: software you don&#39;t write everything from

00:09:52.979 --> 00:09:58.018
Caption: Star we just said don&#39;t use don&#39;t roll

00:09:55.559 --> 00:10:00.299
Caption: your own authentication like that&#39;s a a

00:09:58.018 --> 00:10:03.419
Caption: rule that people hopefully all follow

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:05.278
Caption: but at the same time you know if you&#39;ve

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:06.659
Caption: got to log files you don&#39;t want to write

00:10:05.278 --> 00:10:08.338
Caption: your own logging solution there&#39;s

00:10:06.659 --> 00:10:09.958
Caption: logging Solutions out there there&#39;s this

00:10:08.338 --> 00:10:11.099
Caption: awesome one called log4j people may have

00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958
Caption: heard of it

00:10:11.099 --> 00:10:15.659
Caption: um then there&#39;s you know maybe you want

00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:17.940
Caption: to upload files to a website or a web

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:20.579
Caption: server collect documents you use a

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.320
Caption: library or you use a dependency but the

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.679
Caption: problem is

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.539
Caption: when you use it you don&#39;t know what&#39;s in

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:31.919
Caption: that Library it can be like a real mess

00:10:27.539 --> 00:10:33.659
Caption: right so this is an uh a comic

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:36.659
Caption: um if you go find it you&#39;ll see like

00:10:33.659 --> 00:10:38.458
Caption: there&#39;s this this piece of string from

00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:40.440
Caption: this chaos

00:10:38.458 --> 00:10:42.359
Caption: all the way you know so it looks nice

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.220
Caption: and harmless here

00:10:42.359 --> 00:10:47.159
Caption: you trust it because it does what you

00:10:44.219 --> 00:10:49.439
Caption: need it to do but it&#39;s a mess all right

00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:52.619
Caption: so who wrote it what checks have they

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:56.159
Caption: done is it safe and secure or are they

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:59.159
Caption: you know gonna give your data away

00:10:56.159 --> 00:11:01.199
Caption: oh look look for Jay so if you don&#39;t

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:03.539
Caption: know what log 4J was it was like the

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.518
Caption: most fun Christmas present uh security

00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:07.018
Caption: team was ever given

00:11:05.518 --> 00:11:08.940
Caption: because basically there was a

00:11:07.018 --> 00:11:12.119
Caption: vulnerability which anyone could exploit

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.500
Caption: by using a URL from memory

00:11:12.119 --> 00:11:15.659
Caption: um and then

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.578
Caption: they patched it and the patch didn&#39;t

00:11:15.659 --> 00:11:19.559
Caption: work so they went through all this

00:11:17.578 --> 00:11:20.940
Caption: trouble to patch it and it didn&#39;t work

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:22.320
Caption: so then they had to patch it again but

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.820
Caption: then that didn&#39;t work so they had to

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.458
Caption: patch it again and they fixed the

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:29.458
Caption: problem by actually removing the feature

00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:32.700
Caption: so it was good time and like it was it&#39;s

00:11:29.458 --> 00:11:34.619
Caption: been used in so many places that it was

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.480
Caption: um a real nightmare and the other

00:11:34.619 --> 00:11:38.099
Caption: example we&#39;ve got for this is the tiny

00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:40.099
Caption: file manager which I&#39;d never heard of I

00:11:38.099 --> 00:11:42.179
Caption: actually searched through cve

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:44.539
Caption: vulnerabilities looking for examples

00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:47.159
Caption: that were pretty straightforward this

00:11:44.539 --> 00:11:50.458
Caption: package allows you to upload files in a

00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:52.979
Caption: website right and this one here if you

00:11:50.458 --> 00:11:55.078
Caption: upload a file and that file has the

00:11:52.979 --> 00:11:56.398
Caption: right file name you can actually put

00:11:55.078 --> 00:11:59.278
Caption: code in the file name and it would

00:11:56.398 --> 00:12:01.140
Caption: execute the code so it um it seemed like

00:11:59.278 --> 00:12:03.838
Caption: a pretty simple one to execute if you

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.940
Caption: knew that it was vulnerable so you know

00:12:03.838 --> 00:12:07.500
Caption: you just want to be able to upload files

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.039
Caption: you don&#39;t care how it does it but maybe

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.039
Caption: you need to

00:12:10.619 --> 00:12:14.059
Caption: okay let&#39;s talk about storing customer

00:12:12.838 --> 00:12:17.099
Caption: data

00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:19.799
Caption: authentication we need to ensure that

00:12:17.099 --> 00:12:22.139
Caption: the user is the person they say they are

00:12:19.799 --> 00:12:24.059
Caption: by authentication this means that only

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:27.119
Caption: an application is allowed to access

00:12:24.059 --> 00:12:28.799
Caption: certain data for example when we have a

00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:31.380
Caption: server on the back end that manages

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:34.200
Caption: multiple websites and we only want

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.838
Caption: website a to be allowed to access to

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.398
Caption: authenticate database B

00:12:36.838 --> 00:12:41.099
Caption: Access Control

00:12:38.398 --> 00:12:43.559
Caption: that means to check if a user is allowed

00:12:41.099 --> 00:12:46.739
Caption: to access an application or a database

00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:49.018
Caption: that he or she is trying to access for

00:12:46.739 --> 00:12:50.880
Caption: instance a human resource manager of a

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:52.799
Caption: company is allowed to access the

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.559
Caption: database that contains employees

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:57.719
Caption: information but an IT admin does not

00:12:55.559 --> 00:13:00.000
Caption: this will also prevent Hackers from

00:12:57.719 --> 00:13:02.299
Caption: easily obtaining a company sensitive

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.299
Caption: information

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.958
Caption: so this also applies if you&#39;re writing

00:13:05.338 --> 00:13:09.179
Caption: an application you can have a service

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:11.518
Caption: principle which is like a user account

00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:13.320
Caption: for the application itself you can

00:13:11.518 --> 00:13:15.239
Caption: assign only the permissions that it&#39;s

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.619
Caption: needed so that it can only authenticate

00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:17.940
Caption: against the services it needs to

00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:20.820
Caption: authenticate and then once it&#39;s

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.559
Caption: authenticated it can only access the

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:25.078
Caption: data or services that it needs to access

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:27.419
Caption: so it works equally the same with a

00:13:25.078 --> 00:13:30.359
Caption: human or with an application

00:13:27.419 --> 00:13:32.518
Caption: and then we&#39;ve got two more uh parts

00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:34.739
Caption: around the storing we&#39;re looking at the

00:13:32.518 --> 00:13:38.518
Caption: encrypting data when it&#39;s at rest and

00:13:34.739 --> 00:13:42.479
Caption: when it&#39;s that Transit so just assuming

00:13:38.518 --> 00:13:44.578
Caption: you um your service is compromised and

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:47.099
Caption: they are able to steal that data if it&#39;s

00:13:44.578 --> 00:13:48.599
Caption: encrypted at rest and you know you

00:13:47.099 --> 00:13:51.599
Caption: haven&#39;t done something silly like put

00:13:48.599 --> 00:13:53.398
Caption: your encryption key in your code then

00:13:51.599 --> 00:13:55.138
Caption: odds are they&#39;re not going to be able to

00:13:53.398 --> 00:13:57.299
Caption: do much with that blob of data like a

00:13:55.138 --> 00:13:59.338
Caption: modern encryption system is such that it

00:13:57.299 --> 00:14:00.719
Caption: can&#39;t be easily cracked even if you&#39;re

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:03.898
Caption: you know leveraging the power of a

00:14:00.719 --> 00:14:06.419
Caption: nation state and then also in transit

00:14:03.898 --> 00:14:09.838
Caption: when you&#39;re sending data between Network

00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:12.380
Caption: Services or you know a modern web

00:14:09.838 --> 00:14:14.219
Caption: service would have multiple components

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.599
Caption: sending the data between those

00:14:14.219 --> 00:14:17.898
Caption: components you want to make sure you&#39;re

00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:20.159
Caption: using an encrypted Channel because

00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:21.479
Caption: especially if you&#39;re using

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:25.379
Caption: um you know

00:14:21.479 --> 00:14:27.419
Caption: cheap providers or trying to rationalize

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.099
Caption: across multiple providers

00:14:27.419 --> 00:14:31.260
Caption: sending that data might go over the

00:14:29.099 --> 00:14:32.819
Caption: public internet or I might go over

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.320
Caption: shared channels so if you have your

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:37.320
Caption: encryption you&#39;re maintaining privacy

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.838
Caption: between your different endpoints so it&#39;s

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:42.859
Caption: it&#39;s super important to make sure you&#39;re

00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:42.859
Caption: using encryption

00:14:43.739 --> 00:14:47.578
Caption: so

00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:49.919
Caption: we&#39;ve got some key takeaways

00:14:47.578 --> 00:14:52.078
Caption: passwords are terrible

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:53.760
Caption: if you can move away from passwords

00:14:52.078 --> 00:14:55.500
Caption: probably a bit hard if you&#39;re just

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.838
Caption: writing a web app to you know do your

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.599
Caption: fantasy football or something but you

00:14:57.838 --> 00:15:02.880
Caption: still could you know not to show

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:04.739
Caption: Microsoft but I work there and you know

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.919
Caption: my authenticator allows you to do

00:15:04.739 --> 00:15:10.380
Caption: password less and I know that other

00:15:07.919 --> 00:15:11.760
Caption: authentication providers allow you to do

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:15.898
Caption: password like through a push

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:18.299
Caption: notification so then your device

00:15:15.898 --> 00:15:20.039
Caption: becomes your password

00:15:18.299 --> 00:15:21.838
Caption: and it doesn&#39;t have to be tied to your

00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:24.898
Caption: phone number which is good

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:28.018
Caption: second software dependencies you rely on

00:15:24.898 --> 00:15:30.659
Caption: might be your undoing so please be sure

00:15:28.018 --> 00:15:32.278
Caption: that your dependencies that your or your

00:15:30.659 --> 00:15:34.319
Caption: your software libraries that you&#39;re

00:15:32.278 --> 00:15:36.958
Caption: using that they&#39;re safe and you&#39;ve got

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.958
Caption: some sort of process to make sure that

00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:42.239
Caption: they stay updated you know

00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:44.099
Caption: you can&#39;t write everything you have to

00:15:42.239 --> 00:15:45.859
Caption: rely on it but you also need to have a

00:15:44.099 --> 00:15:48.479
Caption: process to make sure that it stays safe

00:15:45.859 --> 00:15:50.458
Caption: and lastly make sure you store your data

00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:52.018
Caption: securely because

00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:54.739
Caption: um you know that&#39;s what your customers

00:15:52.018 --> 00:15:54.739
Caption: trust you to do

00:15:56.398 --> 00:16:03.239
Caption: thank you

00:15:58.219 --> 00:16:05.838

Caption: fantastic we do have some time for

00:16:08.458 --> 00:16:11.760
Caption: questions so if you want to pop your

00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.500
Caption: hands up I&#39;ll come around with the

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.898
Caption: microphone and you can feel really cool

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.398
Caption: like me and talking to it and ask a

00:16:15.898 --> 00:16:20.159
Caption: question

00:16:17.398 --> 00:16:22.859
Caption: come on guys

00:16:20.159 --> 00:16:25.679
Caption: you are my man

00:16:22.859 --> 00:16:27.778
Caption: thanks guys so just quick question on um

00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:30.239
Caption: password so what if he&#39;s out of that

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:32.338
Caption: like uses like Google to log in is that

00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:34.859
Caption: better than password oh yeah

00:16:32.338 --> 00:16:37.440
Caption: yeah yeah like a hyperscaler is going to

00:16:34.859 --> 00:16:40.258
Caption: do a much better job than yourself

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:42.239
Caption: or you know even if you&#39;re leveraging

00:16:40.258 --> 00:16:44.039
Caption: like a PHP library or something like

00:16:42.239 --> 00:16:46.799
Caption: that just just seeing if you can

00:16:44.039 --> 00:16:49.979
Caption: Outsource to a company that is doing

00:16:46.799 --> 00:16:51.119
Caption: millions of logins a day or a second or

00:16:49.979 --> 00:16:54.198
Caption: whatever then they&#39;re going to have a

00:16:51.119 --> 00:16:54.198
Caption: lot more better protection

00:16:54.359 --> 00:16:59.578
Caption: I&#39;m going to Chuck a question in should

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:03.299
Caption: I go and put my email address in that

00:16:59.578 --> 00:17:06.058
Caption: have I been porn yes like seriously I

00:17:03.299 --> 00:17:10.438
Caption: should probably do that between yes yeah

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:12.739
Caption: okay cool we learn something new every

00:17:10.438 --> 00:17:12.739
Caption: day

00:17:14.938 --> 00:17:20.279
Caption: I just wanted to ask what is your

00:17:16.979 --> 00:17:23.400
Caption: opinion on authentication tokens or the

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.140
Caption: ones that do the generation numbers that

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.958
Caption: some companies give you

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:29.700
Caption: oh like an RSA token yeah yeah generally

00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:31.859
Caption: pretty safe I mean like because you need

00:17:29.699 --> 00:17:34.079
Caption: to have registered on the device that

00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:35.819
Caption: you trust whether it&#39;s your little token

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:36.719
Caption: or if it&#39;s the authenticator app on your

00:17:35.819 --> 00:17:39.418
Caption: phone

00:17:36.719 --> 00:17:41.459
Caption: um so there&#39;s only one source of that

00:17:39.418 --> 00:17:43.380
Caption: six digit number to log in

00:17:41.459 --> 00:17:45.178
Caption: right so when you lose your phone it&#39;s a

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.979
Caption: pain in the you know because you

00:17:45.178 --> 00:17:49.199
Caption: sometimes have a whole series of codes

00:17:46.979 --> 00:17:52.558
Caption: that you can use as one-time logins to

00:17:49.199 --> 00:17:53.880
Caption: prove you are who you are but even if

00:17:52.558 --> 00:17:55.380
Caption: someone does a Sim swap they&#39;re not

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.160
Caption: stealing all the data on your phone so

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.780
Caption: if you&#39;ve got like the Google

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.400
Caption: Authenticator Microsoft authenticator

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.299
Caption: LastPass authenticator twilio

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.580
Caption: authenticator like there&#39;s

00:18:00.298 --> 00:18:04.979
Caption: authenticators everywhere if you&#39;re

00:18:02.579 --> 00:18:06.959
Caption: using just one of those then that is the

00:18:04.979 --> 00:18:10.219
Caption: source of truth even if someone steals

00:18:06.959 --> 00:18:10.219
Caption: your password good let them

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:19.799
Caption: oh duck there was one here

00:18:16.439 --> 00:18:22.019
Caption: uh just curious uh you recommended we

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:24.000
Caption: try to use different passwords for

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:27.359
Caption: different platforms

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.699
Caption: um I do know we have some free open

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:32.699
Caption: password manager

00:18:29.699 --> 00:18:34.678
Caption: two do you recommend people to use it if

00:18:32.699 --> 00:18:37.739
Caption: so what kind of tools do you use

00:18:34.678 --> 00:18:40.619
Caption: personally except the kitchen like

00:18:37.739 --> 00:18:46.678
Caption: iPhone use so yeah

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:48.660
Caption: these one uh personally I do not but I

00:18:46.678 --> 00:18:51.359
Caption: have my organization people sitting over

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.580
Caption: there and they use Bill Warden as their

00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:56.479
Caption: password manager I hope they don&#39;t kill

00:18:53.579 --> 00:18:59.760
Caption: me when I get off the stage

00:18:56.479 --> 00:19:02.640
Caption: uh I don&#39;t want to read that report

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.599
Caption: um I use LastPass and

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.880
Caption: um

00:19:03.599 --> 00:19:07.500
Caption: LastPass but that one&#39;s a paid one but

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.678
Caption: I&#39;m lucky because I became a customer

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:13.500
Caption: like 2012 so I knew still pay 12 us a

00:19:10.678 --> 00:19:15.839
Caption: year for it and

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:18.959
Caption: the other one which is on the have I

00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:21.178
Caption: been owned past uh key pass no

00:19:18.959 --> 00:19:24.298
Caption: one password thank you yes

00:19:21.178 --> 00:19:26.399
Caption: and I also use my phone but it syncs

00:19:24.298 --> 00:19:28.439
Caption: across yeah

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.960
Caption: and so when I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get in

00:19:28.439 --> 00:19:32.879
Caption: trouble you can hack me later on from

00:19:30.959 --> 00:19:36.199
Caption: what I&#39;ve worked out we might make it up

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.199
Caption: we&#39;ll talk about this later

00:19:36.298 --> 00:19:39.959
Caption: yeah all right thanks for that um I was

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.520
Caption: going to ask about password managers as

00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:44.038
Caption: well so some of them are offering the

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.660
Caption: MFA functionality in there as well do

00:19:44.038 --> 00:19:48.239
Caption: you think that&#39;s a good idea having the

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.739
Caption: password and the MFA yes like like one

00:19:48.239 --> 00:19:52.020
Caption: password for example yes and then you

00:19:49.739 --> 00:19:54.479
Caption: mentioned LastPass but even the password

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:57.299
Caption: managers are getting compromised yes

00:19:54.479 --> 00:19:59.400
Caption: like they had a recent issue in the dev

00:19:57.298 --> 00:20:00.899
Caption: environment I think and I don&#39;t know

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.539
Caption: what do you what&#39;s your take on all that

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.940
Caption: so LastPass was compromised only a week

00:20:03.538 --> 00:20:08.099
Caption: or two ago like their servers got done

00:20:05.939 --> 00:20:10.678
Caption: and I&#39;m completely comfortable with that

00:20:08.099 --> 00:20:12.900
Caption: because the way LastPass works is they

00:20:10.678 --> 00:20:14.760
Caption: just get an encrypted blob of data and

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:16.979
Caption: your master password is the key to

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.079
Caption: decrypt that blob of data so

00:20:16.979 --> 00:20:20.699
Caption: and you know if they can guess their

00:20:19.079 --> 00:20:21.959
Caption: password and and that&#39;s not like a

00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:23.279
Caption: random generated one because I have to

00:20:21.959 --> 00:20:25.319
Caption: type it from memory

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.359
Caption: um but it&#39;s still you know almost 20

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:29.579
Caption: characters long so

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:32.339
Caption: I feel good about that um I would feel

00:20:29.579 --> 00:20:34.859
Caption: bad if there was like poorly written

00:20:32.339 --> 00:20:37.558
Caption: code which meant they could bypass the

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:40.260
Caption: encryption key or do it another way then

00:20:37.558 --> 00:20:43.199
Caption: I&#39;d feel really sucky about it um having

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:45.119
Caption: um the MFA in the same solution as the

00:20:43.199 --> 00:20:47.819
Caption: password manager I&#39;m fine with because

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:49.678
Caption: my password manager I can log in on like

00:20:47.819 --> 00:20:52.259
Caption: I don&#39;t know how many devices but the

00:20:49.678 --> 00:20:53.819
Caption: MFA still stays on that same device and

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:57.178
Caption: it&#39;s like that single source of Truth

00:20:53.819 --> 00:21:00.058
Caption: still so if you know you buy a new phone

00:20:57.178 --> 00:21:01.319
Caption: you need to transfer that MFA from one

00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:02.279
Caption: to the other

00:21:01.319 --> 00:21:05.538
Caption: um

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.539
Caption: so yeah it&#39;s pretty good

00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:15.260
Caption: these guys have killed

00:21:17.038 --> 00:21:22.678
Caption: killed it and when I look forward to

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:25.140
Caption: seeing you next year too all right guys

00:21:22.678 --> 00:21:27.000
Caption: we do have another session in here I

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:30.619
Caption: have just lost my notes to give me two

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.619
Caption: secs and I&#39;ll let you know who it is

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:46.859
Caption: alrighty guys at 12 50 we&#39;ve got Josh

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:50.239
Caption: Armitage with serverless testing local

00:21:46.859 --> 00:21:50.239
Caption: considered harmful
