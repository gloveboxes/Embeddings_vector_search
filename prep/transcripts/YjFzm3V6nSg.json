  "description": "It\u0027s a common practice to verify a phone number or implement two factor authentication by sending a one time password over SMS. We can all agree that it\u0027s a pretty terrible user experience though.\\n\\nThis process may increase security, but the friction can decrease conversion and the user experience in general. Android and iOS have APIs to combat this, so why not the web? In this talk we\u0027ll take a look at autocomplete and the WebOTP API to see how the web platform can help us build secure flows and a better experience all round.\\n\\nMostly intermediate\\n20 mins\\nFrontend Development\\nPhil is a developer evangelist for Twilio and a Google Developer Expert. He\u0027s been in the web industry for 10 years building with JavaScript and Ruby. He can be found hanging out at meetups and conferences, playing with new technologies and APIs or writing open source code online. Sometimes he makes his own beer, but he\u0027s more likely to be found discovering new ones around the world.\\n\\nPhil tweets at @philnash and you can find him elsewhere online at https://philna.sh."
