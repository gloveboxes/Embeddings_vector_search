  "description": "Technology moves rapidly. We\u0027ve learned to move fast and break things, but this method of production often has unintended consequences; machines causing algorithmic harm towards already marginalised groups, a digital economy built to extract data and incrementally influence human behaviour with dubious consent, cryptocurrency contributing harmful emissions and cooking the planet at the same rate as a small country.\\n\\nWorking in the tech industry is a privilege and I want to use that good fortune to contribute to a future that is designed to enhance the wellbeing of as many people as possible - not extract and exploit. The sophistication of Indigenous thinking can not only help us build more robust ethical frameworks, but also help unlock the next frontier of technological development.\\n\\nIn Australia, we have the privilege of living amongst the world\u0027s oldest continuing culture. A culture that has transferred information between generations for 10s of 1000s of years with incredible fidelity does not happen by accident; it involves knowledge of living harmoniously with complex adaptive systems that Western science is slowly catching up to. \\n\\nWhat kind of protocols can we learn from Indigenous ways of thinking that can help us build better ethical practices for building technology? How can we optimise for wellbeing and abundance, rather than the kind of limitless growth that is at odds with a healthy planet? \\n\\n--\\nKathryn is a technologist and digital rights activist currently serving on the board of Electronic Frontiers Australia, and campaigns for human rights across movements. She is passionate about using Indigenous thinking - caring for Country and caring for Kin - to shape and foster an ethical future for technology.\\n\\nKathryn is currently leading a new initiative at ThoughtWorks creating careers for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander technologists."
