WEBVTT

00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:06.199
Caption: we&#39;ve got Ben Lowry talking about

00:00:02.158 --> 00:00:06.199
Caption: offline first not offline mode

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.579
Caption: hey everybody uh so yeah hearing to talk

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.699
Caption: about offline first not offline mode

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:19.380
Caption: like courageous Set uh if you don&#39;t have

00:00:17.698 --> 00:00:20.639
Caption: any idea what that might be related to

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:23.639
Caption: it&#39;s basically talking about

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:24.959
Caption: applications that work offline now it

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:26.278
Caption: can be difficult to build an app that

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:27.598
Caption: works offline

00:00:26.278 --> 00:00:29.698
Caption: there are a bunch of challenges and

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.439
Caption: stuff that we&#39;ll talk about as we go on

00:00:29.698 --> 00:00:32.880
Caption: um and obviously a lot of benefits that

00:00:31.438 --> 00:00:33.718
Caption: come with it otherwise why would you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.760
Caption: bother

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.700
Caption: right off the bat I want to thank

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:42.779
Caption: whichever DDD volunteer made this slide

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.079
Caption: it&#39;s really nice uh the rest of the talk

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:48.718
Caption: is more like this

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:52.259
Caption: good old click-a-thon there we go

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.360
Caption: so nice plan don&#39;t expect the flashy

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:55.558
Caption: stuff you just saw

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.260
Caption: so

00:00:55.558 --> 00:01:00.718
Caption: I&#39;ll talk a little bit about me I&#39;m Ben

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:02.398
Caption: Lowry a lead consultant at Telstra

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.680
Caption: purple I&#39;ve spoken and did it a few

00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:05.419
Caption: times before you may have seen me up

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.979
Caption: there

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:10.139
Caption: or if you&#39;re in Karen&#39;s talk just before

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:12.658
Caption: this I&#39;ve featured pretty heavily on

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:14.099
Caption: that so um you may recognize me there

00:01:12.658 --> 00:01:15.539
Caption: too

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:17.519
Caption: uh

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.379
Caption: I want to thank for the other sponsors I

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:20.519
Caption: know I think one particular volunteer I

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:22.199
Caption: don&#39;t actually know who it was but

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:24.419
Caption: everyone who&#39;s volunteered and all the

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:28.079
Caption: sponsors who have gone into making today

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:31.040
Caption: happen it&#39;s a big deal and the event

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.040
Caption: doesn&#39;t happen without them

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.220
Caption: cool so an offline application what is

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:41.399
Caption: an offline application uh well it&#39;s an

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.520
Caption: application that works offline

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.959
Caption: that much is clear uh we&#39;re going to

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:48.478
Caption: talk about you know why you&#39;d want to

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.639
Caption: build one what benefits you get from

00:01:48.478 --> 00:01:52.739
Caption: doing it and some of the challenges

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:56.639
Caption: that come from that

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:58.379
Caption: in terms of how you&#39;d actually do that

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:00.680
Caption: I&#39;m not really going to get too much

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:03.360
Caption: into specific libraries or Frameworks

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.459
Caption: it&#39;s more general advice mostly because

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.840
Caption: there are a bunch of people here you

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.119
Caption: might all be using different Tech and a

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:10.559
Caption: lot of this stuff is transferable if it

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.419
Caption: went specifically

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:14.419
Caption: I only work for three of you let&#39;s say

00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:19.080
Caption: so why what you want to build an offline

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:21.238
Caption: app a big one is if you have an app that

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.680
Caption: needs to be used in remote areas

00:02:21.238 --> 00:02:26.940
Caption: uh this is a map of 4G and and 5G if you

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.098
Caption: look at the little purple bits those are

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.979
Caption: 5G

00:02:28.098 --> 00:02:33.779
Caption: what coverage basically from Telstra

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.919
Caption: uh so I assume that&#39;s bigger than all

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:36.479
Caption: the other ones but I don&#39;t know but

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:39.479
Caption: there&#39;s still a lot of areas in

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:41.699
Caption: Australia particularly in wa where you

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:44.220
Caption: don&#39;t get any internet so if you&#39;re

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:47.399
Caption: working or building an app that needs to

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.440
Caption: work say on a mine site or an oil rig or

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:51.059
Caption: a remote Community like maybe you&#39;re

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.040
Caption: building something for a water Corp or

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:55.139
Caption: something and they need to go out in the

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.119
Caption: field and use it then there are a whole

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.860
Caption: bunch of places where being offline but

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:01.518
Caption: still being able to do your job is

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.518
Caption: really important

00:03:01.738 --> 00:03:08.399
Caption: another one might be if you have uh

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.080
Caption: Internet outages so this graph is

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:13.500
Caption: basically a cloudflare outage that

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.900
Caption: happened in June uh basically you can

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.458
Caption: see for about an hour that

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:20.458
Caption: the internet traffic they were serving

00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:23.759
Caption: halved now given that cloudflare serve

00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:25.800
Caption: about 20 of the internet in general that

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:29.699
Caption: all of a sudden dropped to about 10. so

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.919
Caption: 10 internet just didn&#39;t work

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.539
Caption: uh if you want to be resilient to that

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:35.639
Caption: and resilience is something we&#39;ll talk

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:38.039
Caption: about quite a bit today if you went to

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.319
Caption: Derek&#39;s talking here earlier

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:42.479
Caption: you probably uh have some useful tips

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.419
Caption: already I might give you a few more or a

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:48.119
Caption: few slightly different views of that

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:50.098
Caption: but what the resiliency gives you is

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:51.539
Caption: actually more than just when the whole

00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:53.518
Caption: internet goes down you also get

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:55.979
Caption: resiliency for things like if you don&#39;t

00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:58.738
Caption: have zero downtime deployments

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.899
Caption: or if you just have a bug in your code

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:02.220
Caption: where you start returning 500 is there a

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:04.439
Caption: configuration error or something like

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.238
Caption: that it means that users can keep doing

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.279
Caption: their work without worrying that it&#39;s

00:04:06.238 --> 00:04:10.080
Caption: not going anywhere

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:12.179
Caption: so you&#39;ve had to build the app in a way

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.080
Caption: that is resilient but by doing that you

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:15.079
Caption: get a lot of benefits

00:04:15.238 --> 00:04:20.760
Caption: the other one is just kind of

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.440
Caption: situational uh lack of Internet so if

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.839
Caption: anyone got betraying here this morning

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.000
Caption: you may have gone through a tunnel and

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:28.440
Caption: maybe your internet dropped out or I

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.139
Caption: know for me personally most of the days

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.779
Caption: I go to work as I&#39;m leaving my house

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.979
Caption: I&#39;ll start scrolling through Spotify or

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:37.919
Caption: something to find something to listen to

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.619
Caption: and then as I leave my house Wi-Fi get

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.080
Caption: the you know into the world I guess the

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:44.880
Caption: 4G or whatever then

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:46.918
Caption: my internet cuts out and always says

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.179
Caption: you&#39;re offline and it&#39;s a little bit

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.559
Caption: annoying that things don&#39;t work in that

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:52.019
Caption: period

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:53.339
Caption: other times you know uh you want go for

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:54.899
Caption: hiking or something you just find

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:56.040
Caption: yourself in a situation where you don&#39;t

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:57.540
Caption: have internet

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.800
Caption: and it&#39;s not really your fault it&#39;s only

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.119
Caption: going to be for a short time but you

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:02.119
Caption: just want to keep doing your job

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:07.859
Caption: another reason you might want to have an

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:09.059
Caption: offline app is for security or privacy

00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:12.179
Caption: reasons

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:13.559
Caption: so to use an example of something that&#39;s

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:15.299
Caption: been in the news a little bit recently

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:18.000
Caption: in the US they

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:19.379
Caption: uh change some laws around abortions and

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.179
Caption: there were recommendations going around

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.860
Caption: to like delete period tracking apps and

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:24.779
Caption: that kind of thing because the data gets

00:05:22.859 --> 00:05:27.059
Caption: stored in the cloud and you know maybe

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:28.919
Caption: they can go and I don&#39;t know petition

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:30.839
Caption: not petition like subpoena or whatever

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.000
Caption: one of those apps to get all that data

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:35.279
Caption: find out whatever they want to find out

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.139
Caption: I don&#39;t know nefarious things

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:39.119
Caption: uh if the data never leaves the device

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.500
Caption: then you don&#39;t have to worry about it so

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:43.320
Caption: much I mean they could still get your

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.139
Caption: device but it just more a targeted

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.660
Caption: attack at that point so

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.179
Caption: and then the final one that I&#39;ve got

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.919
Caption: here is that it&#39;s actually oftentimes a

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:55.199
Caption: better experience for users it might be

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.779
Caption: faster because you don&#39;t have to wait

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.720
Caption: for it to load all the time uh you might

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:02.820
Caption: use less battery or less Network so in

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.440
Caption: like data constrained environments

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.600
Caption: particularly in you know places like

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.660
Caption: Africa or southeast Asia or wherever

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.699
Caption: where data isn&#39;t cheap that can be a

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.979
Caption: benefit you know you can do things on

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:17.000
Caption: Wi-Fi and then go offline when you&#39;re

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.000
Caption: not in Wi-Fi

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.319
Caption: so as an example of how much that&#39;s

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.899
Caption: quicker I have a colleague who worked on

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:27.839
Caption: a an app that has an offline mode

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:29.220
Caption: and they have a multi-step form so at

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:30.839
Caption: the top here we&#39;ve got the offline mode

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.899
Caption: and at the bottom

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:37.319
Caption: offline first application sorry on

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:39.660
Caption: offline and then online

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.720
Caption: so the reason that it&#39;s faster is

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.519
Caption: basically because when I click next

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.919
Caption: one on goes straight to the next page

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:49.138
Caption: and the other one goes cool I&#39;ll save

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:51.839
Caption: what you&#39;ve just done

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.940
Caption: and then I&#39;ll take you to the next page

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:55.799
Caption: so without that spinner things get a lot

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.979
Caption: faster and and the example is colleague

00:06:55.799 --> 00:07:00.959
Caption: gave me was that the offline mode took

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:03.119
Caption: about 40 seconds to fill in this whole

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:06.239
Caption: form this multi-stage form or whatever

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:08.880
Caption: and the online one took you know 60 or

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:11.039
Caption: 80 seconds or something like that so you

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.020
Caption: do get some benefits from having an app

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:16.259
Caption: that works offline just because

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:18.239
Caption: it doesn&#39;t actually need to do as much

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:21.119
Caption: yeah

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:22.679
Caption: now every application is different and

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:25.199
Caption: there are going to be different kinds of

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:27.359
Caption: offline applications as well

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:29.759
Caption: some of them

00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:31.559
Caption: you might need to go online periodically

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.779
Caption: some of them might kind of have a

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:35.579
Caption: fallback that works offline

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:36.839
Caption: and then others are going to have you

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:38.220
Caption: know kind of the full functionality

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:39.660
Caption: offline

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.819
Caption: it really does depend on what you want

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.819
Caption: to build and what your kind of users

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:47.519
Caption: needs are like Spotify for example

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:50.880
Caption: probably lets you download all your uh

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:52.500
Caption: or your tracks to play offline but you

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.660
Caption: can&#39;t use a search function to go and

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.000
Caption: find more stuff for example that&#39;s the

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.679
Caption: compromise they&#39;ve made and that&#39;s just

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.479
Caption: what works for them

00:07:58.679 --> 00:08:03.539
Caption: so I like to think of it as layering up

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:05.220
Caption: complexity uh at the base level you&#39;ve

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:07.799
Caption: kind of got an app that&#39;s only a read

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.239
Caption: only those are really easy to make work

00:08:07.799 --> 00:08:11.279
Caption: offline because you just download the

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:13.559
Caption: data and leave it there

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:15.598
Caption: the next kind of level is when you have

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:17.759
Caption: data that

00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:19.739
Caption: only stays on the device it never

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:21.959
Caption: actually gets any further

00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:22.979
Caption: and those again they&#39;re pretty easy you

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:25.199
Caption: never need to talk to the network

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:27.839
Caption: everything&#39;s fine

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:30.598
Caption: uh you might have some sort of caveats

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:33.919
Caption: to those where for example they

00:08:30.598 --> 00:08:33.919
Caption: sync data to online

00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:40.079
Caption: when you choose to so you can you know

00:08:36.838 --> 00:08:41.580
Caption: export and import kind of stuff

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.338
Caption: one of the reasons you might want to

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.600
Caption: build one of these apps is because it&#39;s

00:08:44.338 --> 00:08:47.820
Caption: really important that the data is

00:08:45.599 --> 00:08:49.440
Caption: actually always available

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.119
Caption: and it&#39;s always up to date so if you

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.398
Caption: know you&#39;re not getting it from a server

00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:55.018
Caption: somewhere then what you&#39;ve got on the

00:08:53.398 --> 00:08:56.880
Caption: device is actually

00:08:55.018 --> 00:08:59.278
Caption: perfect right it&#39;s it&#39;s the source of

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.500
Caption: truth that&#39;s where everything goes

00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:03.479
Caption: but just because you&#39;re not

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.219
Caption: online doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have

00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:08.039
Caption: similar same features that are online so

00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:10.379
Caption: if we imagine like a first aid app where

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:11.278
Caption: you can download first date articles or

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.099
Caption: something

00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:16.619
Caption: then you go out into the bush and you

00:09:14.099 --> 00:09:19.979
Caption: get bit by a snake so you open up your

00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:22.799
Caption: offline first aid application and you

00:09:19.979 --> 00:09:25.380
Caption: type into the search snake bite

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:27.479
Caption: and then it goes oh you&#39;re offline I

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.518
Caption: can&#39;t return any results that&#39;s not a

00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:32.599
Caption: great experience right so you do still

00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:32.599
Caption: need some things to work

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.500
Caption: the next one is

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:40.259
Caption: pretty classic like graceful degradation

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.880
Caption: scenario you have an online app that

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.940
Caption: works online everything is editable

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.398
Caption: whatever and then when you go offline

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.859
Caption: you lose some functionality so you can&#39;t

00:09:47.398 --> 00:09:51.539
Caption: edit anymore but you can still read all

00:09:49.859 --> 00:09:53.579
Caption: the data to help you make decisions and

00:09:51.539 --> 00:09:55.919
Caption: stuff it might be appropriate for

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.980
Caption: whatever you&#39;re building

00:09:55.919 --> 00:10:01.500
Caption: um like an example could be a shopping

00:09:58.979 --> 00:10:03.299
Caption: list or something where you can download

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.979
Caption: a shared shopping list

00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:06.419
Caption: and directs here but you can&#39;t actually

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:08.820
Caption: make changes

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:10.018
Caption: maybe a bad example but it&#39;s the kind of

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.260
Caption: thing you could build

00:10:10.018 --> 00:10:15.119
Caption: the next level would be where some data

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.799
Caption: is editable so

00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:18.179
Caption: you might only be able to create stuff

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:19.640
Caption: but you can&#39;t edit stuff that already

00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:22.080
Caption: exists

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.000
Caption: and then the last level of kind of

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.880
Caption: complexity and this is what we&#39;re going

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.500
Caption: to focus most on for this talk is those

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.838
Caption: apps where

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.760
Caption: just about everything works offline not

00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:34.619
Caption: everything everything can work offline

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.359
Caption: like you can&#39;t do video streaming or

00:10:34.619 --> 00:10:38.880
Caption: live chat or anything like that

00:10:36.359 --> 00:10:40.018
Caption: but if you can do all of your job you

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.539
Caption: can go around

00:10:40.018 --> 00:10:44.639
Caption: editing things and deleting things and

00:10:42.539 --> 00:10:48.018
Caption: completing tasks or whatever then that&#39;s

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.019
Caption: a good step at least

00:10:48.179 --> 00:10:52.679
Caption: so broadly speaking you&#39;ve got offline

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:55.018
Caption: only and then mixed kind of offline and

00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:58.018
Caption: online apps

00:10:55.018 --> 00:11:00.419
Caption: so I&#39;ve got an idea let&#39;s add an offline

00:10:58.018 --> 00:11:02.398
Caption: mode to our app offline mode seems easy

00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:04.320
Caption: I&#39;ve I&#39;ve sold you on all the benefits

00:11:02.398 --> 00:11:06.119
Caption: right so let&#39;s go and do it I&#39;ve already

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.419
Caption: got a to-do list app

00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:10.979
Caption: how do I start well the first thing is

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:13.078
Caption: that you have to download your data to

00:11:10.979 --> 00:11:15.419
Caption: use when you&#39;re offline

00:11:13.078 --> 00:11:17.820
Caption: so what does that actually mean

00:11:15.419 --> 00:11:20.278
Caption: uh downloading your data means

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.018
Caption: essentially you&#39;re going to keep a local

00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:25.078
Caption: copy of that data

00:11:22.018 --> 00:11:26.880
Caption: and then anytime

00:11:25.078 --> 00:11:28.380
Caption: you use the app you just read from that

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.660
Caption: local data

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.500
Caption: it&#39;s pretty easy

00:11:30.659 --> 00:11:34.259
Caption: um

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.539
Caption: the other part of that will be that when

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.338
Caption: you make changes you need to sync them

00:11:36.539 --> 00:11:40.199
Caption: back up to the server

00:11:38.338 --> 00:11:43.260
Caption: so

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.760
Caption: there are a few ways you can do this a

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.278
Caption: lot of smart people have gone into the

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:50.338
Caption: effort of actually deciding what that is

00:11:47.278 --> 00:11:54.000
Caption: uh there&#39;s a thing called a crdt which

00:11:50.338 --> 00:11:56.338
Caption: is a conflict flea replicated data type

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.200
Caption: and the idea is that

00:11:56.338 --> 00:11:59.760
Caption: every kind of local copy of your

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.739
Caption: database and the one on the server is

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.239
Caption: actually kind of like a distributed

00:12:01.739 --> 00:12:06.119
Caption: system and you just need to replicate

00:12:03.239 --> 00:12:07.500
Caption: changes across them so all your Cloud

00:12:06.119 --> 00:12:11.398
Caption: providers and stuff will probably handle

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:14.760
Caption: this for you in terms of like I&#39;ve got a

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:16.679
Caption: SQL database or a table storage or dyno

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.419
Caption: ADB or something

00:12:16.679 --> 00:12:20.578
Caption: but the way they actually do it is using

00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:24.179
Caption: these crdts so there are three broad

00:12:20.578 --> 00:12:27.719
Caption: categories one is Operation based which

00:12:24.179 --> 00:12:30.239
Caption: is essentially like having a list of

00:12:27.719 --> 00:12:34.078
Caption: uh operations that you&#39;ve done so you

00:12:30.239 --> 00:12:36.719
Caption: might say I&#39;ve done a create task in my

00:12:34.078 --> 00:12:38.039
Caption: to-do list and then you save that for

00:12:36.719 --> 00:12:40.379
Caption: later and when you&#39;ve come back online

00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:42.539
Caption: you process all of them and go from

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.638
Caption: there another one is where you just

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:46.619
Caption: update the um

00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:47.880
Caption: the local database you&#39;ve got and then

00:12:46.619 --> 00:12:49.619
Caption: have something that

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.119
Caption: basically just sends that up to the

00:12:49.619 --> 00:12:54.500
Caption: server something on the server that

00:12:51.119 --> 00:12:57.719
Caption: figures out what changed and saves it

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.940
Caption: that sounds really cool and there are

00:12:57.719 --> 00:13:01.439
Caption: some tools that do it but I don&#39;t in

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.200
Caption: fact we have much experience with those

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.578
Caption: specifically

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.679
Caption: and then the other one is just the

00:13:05.578 --> 00:13:10.260
Caption: saving changes so you get kind of

00:13:07.679 --> 00:13:12.419
Caption: databases that have

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.979
Caption: rather than storing the state of the

00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:15.719
Caption: thing you just keep a list of changes

00:13:13.979 --> 00:13:18.239
Caption: and you and essentially you send those

00:13:15.719 --> 00:13:19.559
Caption: up to a server when you come back online

00:13:18.239 --> 00:13:20.940
Caption: now the one I&#39;m going to talk most about

00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:22.619
Caption: is the queue because I feel like that&#39;s

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.720
Caption: the easiest for people to reason about

00:13:22.619 --> 00:13:27.719
Caption: it&#39;s probably the like the entry level

00:13:24.719 --> 00:13:29.879
Caption: kind of offline mode it&#39;s it&#39;s just

00:13:27.719 --> 00:13:32.778
Caption: doing what you&#39;re already doing but

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.778
Caption: saving it for later

00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:37.320
Caption: so we&#39;ll have a little bit of a look at

00:13:35.458 --> 00:13:39.659
Caption: some code there&#39;s not a lot of code here

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.220
Caption: hopefully it&#39;s something you can

00:13:39.659 --> 00:13:43.138
Caption: reasonably understand even if you don&#39;t

00:13:41.219 --> 00:13:45.000
Caption: write a lot of code

00:13:43.138 --> 00:13:47.940
Caption: basically we have a to-do list and we&#39;re

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.919
Caption: going to say if I&#39;m online then call the

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:52.078
Caption: API to get the to do

00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:55.859
Caption: otherwise get it from my offline data

00:13:52.078 --> 00:13:57.898
Caption: and then return that so

00:13:55.859 --> 00:14:00.179
Caption: it seems okay right if you&#39;re online do

00:13:57.898 --> 00:14:02.880
Caption: this if you&#39;re offline do that

00:14:00.179 --> 00:14:06.179
Caption: the same kind of approach for an update

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:09.359
Caption: uh if we&#39;re online save that to the API

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:15.138
Caption: if we&#39;re offline then update the local

00:14:09.359 --> 00:14:15.138
Caption: storage and cue the update essentially

00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:18.719
Caption: so we can kind of generalize that to say

00:14:17.278 --> 00:14:23.099
Caption: we&#39;ve got an app that when you&#39;re online

00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:25.199
Caption: goes from A to B it does X right

00:14:23.099 --> 00:14:28.018
Caption: if you want to talk about offline though

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.119
Caption: that&#39;s saying if you&#39;re online do X if

00:14:28.018 --> 00:14:32.039
Caption: you&#39;re offline do y

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:33.778
Caption: right it&#39;s not not impossible it&#39;s

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:34.979
Caption: actually not that hard

00:14:33.778 --> 00:14:37.979
Caption: but

00:14:34.979 --> 00:14:40.500
Caption: what&#39;s the problem with it

00:14:37.979 --> 00:14:42.239
Caption: well firstly having two ways of doing

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:45.859
Caption: things means that

00:14:42.239 --> 00:14:45.859
Caption: you have to make sure both ways work

00:14:45.898 --> 00:14:50.398
Caption: you might forget to do one of them like

00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:53.039
Caption: have you worked on an app with an

00:14:50.398 --> 00:14:56.099
Caption: offline mode where someone goes uh yeah

00:14:53.039 --> 00:14:58.380
Caption: that&#39;s done I just there to make it work

00:14:56.099 --> 00:15:00.059
Caption: in offline mode

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.578
Caption: or like I said how many of you have

00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:04.619
Caption: forgotten to make a particular Feature

00:15:02.578 --> 00:15:06.659
Caption: work offline

00:15:04.619 --> 00:15:10.078
Caption: so

00:15:06.659 --> 00:15:12.659
Caption: there&#39;s got to be a better way

00:15:10.078 --> 00:15:14.458
Caption: and that way is to build an offline

00:15:12.659 --> 00:15:16.500
Caption: first app

00:15:14.458 --> 00:15:18.359
Caption: so rather than going from the mindset

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.559
Caption: where I have an app that I want to work

00:15:18.359 --> 00:15:23.099
Caption: offline

00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:25.559
Caption: you say I&#39;ve got an offline application

00:15:23.099 --> 00:15:26.940
Caption: how do I make it work online

00:15:25.559 --> 00:15:28.380
Caption: basically you&#39;re starting from the

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.958
Caption: assumption

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:33.380
Caption: that there is no internet and working up

00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.380
Caption: from there

00:15:33.898 --> 00:15:39.979
Caption: now this comes with a lot of benefits

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.979
Caption: um

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.639
Caption: like I&#39;ve already talked about

00:15:42.539 --> 00:15:46.198
Caption: the biggest one is that

00:15:44.638 --> 00:15:49.198
Caption: it&#39;s actually simpler to reason about

00:15:46.198 --> 00:15:51.179
Caption: when you&#39;ve got one way of doing things

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:53.219
Caption: so rather than

00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:54.299
Caption: saving to the API or queuing it for

00:15:53.219 --> 00:15:57.599
Caption: later

00:15:54.299 --> 00:15:59.159
Caption: you basically just always cure for later

00:15:57.599 --> 00:16:01.259
Caption: and then you have a background process

00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:03.599
Caption: that you know saves into the API later

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.799
Caption: which you would have already had anyway

00:16:03.599 --> 00:16:06.799
Caption: to handle offline mode

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.139
Caption: so

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:19.198
Caption: probably the biggest difference between

00:16:16.138 --> 00:16:22.380
Caption: an offline first app and an offline mode

00:16:19.198 --> 00:16:24.838
Caption: app is that you&#39;re not treating being

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.578
Caption: offline as an error Condition it&#39;s not a

00:16:24.838 --> 00:16:29.599
Caption: special case you need to handle it&#39;s

00:16:26.578 --> 00:16:29.599
Caption: just how it works

00:16:32.278 --> 00:16:36.059
Caption: now I mentioned the term graceful

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.699
Caption: degradation before that&#39;s basically

00:16:36.059 --> 00:16:40.679
Caption: saying I&#39;ve got an app that&#39;s good

00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:43.440
Caption: and when it&#39;s offline

00:16:40.679 --> 00:16:45.299
Caption: it can be almost as good

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.398
Caption: the other way to look at it which is

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:49.679
Caption: what offline first is is saying that

00:16:47.398 --> 00:16:51.659
Caption: it&#39;s a progressive enhancement

00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:53.039
Caption: so rather than having something that

00:16:51.659 --> 00:16:55.138
Caption: gets worse you actually have something

00:16:53.039 --> 00:16:57.419
Caption: that gets better

00:16:55.138 --> 00:16:59.159
Caption: so you build a good offline app and when

00:16:57.419 --> 00:17:00.419
Caption: it&#39;s online you enhance it with other

00:16:59.159 --> 00:17:03.179
Caption: things

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:06.058
Caption: that might be that when you go

00:17:03.179 --> 00:17:07.619
Caption: to edit a particular item like in your

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:10.140
Caption: to-do list you go

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:11.400
Caption: load the to-do list from the uh from the

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.619
Caption: case

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:17.219
Caption: and then hey I&#39;m online so I might as

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:18.780
Caption: well go fetch it and get the new stuff

00:17:17.219 --> 00:17:21.359
Caption: so we&#39;ll go through that little bit of

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:24.479
Caption: code again and we&#39;ll try and change it

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:27.298
Caption: to from offline mode to offline first

00:17:24.479 --> 00:17:29.459
Caption: now I said the big problem was if this

00:17:27.298 --> 00:17:31.079
Caption: else that

00:17:29.459 --> 00:17:33.380
Caption: we get rid of the else and we&#39;ll see

00:17:31.079 --> 00:17:33.380
Caption: what happens

00:17:34.199 --> 00:17:38.760
Caption: it&#39;s gone easy so now we have an online

00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:40.918
Caption: app that fetches the data and then we

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.839
Caption: return the offline data we&#39;ve actually

00:17:40.918 --> 00:17:44.899
Caption: missed one little bit in here so I&#39;ll

00:17:42.839 --> 00:17:47.339
Caption: make room for that and that&#39;s basically

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:50.719
Caption: when we get the new data we have to

00:17:47.339 --> 00:17:50.719
Caption: update the offline case as well

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.298
Caption: now that&#39;s done we can Target the code a

00:17:53.219 --> 00:17:56.579
Caption: little bit get rid of some variables

00:17:54.298 --> 00:17:58.918
Caption: because who likes variables

00:17:56.579 --> 00:18:00.599
Caption: and the codes you know pretty simple if

00:17:58.918 --> 00:18:04.859
Caption: you&#39;re online do this

00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:06.599
Caption: and then always return the offline data

00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:08.459
Caption: I mentioned before that waiting for

00:18:06.599 --> 00:18:10.739
Caption: things actually makes it slower

00:18:08.459 --> 00:18:14.279
Caption: so you can see these async and Away

00:18:10.739 --> 00:18:16.079
Caption: words if you&#39;re not familiar async just

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.479
Caption: says that you can use the await keyword

00:18:16.079 --> 00:18:21.899
Caption: and the awake keyword just actually

00:18:18.479 --> 00:18:24.418
Caption: waits for it so the program will stop

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:27.239
Caption: and wait for that thing to respond

00:18:24.418 --> 00:18:29.699
Caption: if we just get rid of that

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:30.959
Caption: it no longer waits for that response so

00:18:29.699 --> 00:18:33.619
Caption: we don&#39;t have that issue where it&#39;s

00:18:30.959 --> 00:18:35.760
Caption: slower because you&#39;re online

00:18:33.619 --> 00:18:38.099
Caption: now whether or not you can actually do

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.298
Caption: this is going to depend on probably a

00:18:38.099 --> 00:18:42.058
Caption: framework or something that you&#39;re using

00:18:39.298 --> 00:18:43.678
Caption: in react you might write a hook that

00:18:42.058 --> 00:18:47.279
Caption: abstracts that away

00:18:43.678 --> 00:18:49.260
Caption: that&#39;s primarily what I write so

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.020
Caption: I don&#39;t know all the others exactly but

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.479
Caption: other reactive Frameworks like Swift UI

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:57.299
Caption: or reactive UI

00:18:54.479 --> 00:18:58.558
Caption: felt actually have similar Concepts

00:18:57.298 --> 00:19:00.298
Caption: right where you can just update this

00:18:58.558 --> 00:19:02.479
Caption: behind the scenes and then show the new

00:19:00.298 --> 00:19:02.479
Caption: version

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.660
Caption: we can look at our update as well

00:19:04.678 --> 00:19:08.339
Caption: and we go

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.919
Caption: now we&#39;ve got that if else but we&#39;ll

00:19:08.339 --> 00:19:13.619
Caption: tackle it slightly differently

00:19:10.918 --> 00:19:15.538
Caption: instead of relying on updating this

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:18.119
Caption: thing as it&#39;s happening

00:19:15.538 --> 00:19:20.159
Caption: we&#39;ve already built a robust solution to

00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:21.479
Caption: handle those background updates and the

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.239
Caption: robustness of that is very important

00:19:21.479 --> 00:19:26.219
Caption: we&#39;ll talk more about that later

00:19:24.239 --> 00:19:28.678
Caption: so I want to just use that we can get

00:19:26.219 --> 00:19:30.418
Caption: rid of this whole section entirely

00:19:28.678 --> 00:19:33.119
Caption: and we&#39;re left with selling pretty

00:19:30.418 --> 00:19:34.979
Caption: simple right we update the offline data

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:37.160
Caption: and then we schedule the update for

00:19:34.979 --> 00:19:37.160
Caption: later

00:19:38.099 --> 00:19:42.959
Caption: this idea of updating the offline data

00:19:40.678 --> 00:19:45.298
Caption: is actually really interesting uh has

00:19:42.959 --> 00:19:47.699
Caption: anyone heard of optimistic UI or

00:19:45.298 --> 00:19:49.979
Caption: optimistic updates

00:19:47.699 --> 00:19:51.659
Caption: a couple of people so that&#39;s the idea

00:19:49.979 --> 00:19:53.520
Caption: basically that

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.580
Caption: because it feels slowed away all the

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:59.760
Caption: time let&#39;s just update this thing with

00:19:56.579 --> 00:20:02.519
Caption: the expectation that it works

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.380
Caption: now that is something that happens in

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.880
Caption: online apps as well it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.319
Caption: essential in an offline app because

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.260
Caption: otherwise you&#39;re always looking at old

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:13.439
Caption: data but online apps do this as well to

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:15.780
Caption: try and feel faster they basically want

00:20:13.439 --> 00:20:18.359
Caption: that offline experience where things

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:21.179
Caption: just work you know so they

00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:23.459
Caption: there are lots of tools now to go and do

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:26.099
Caption: those optimistic updates they get built

00:20:23.459 --> 00:20:29.159
Caption: into query libraries like Apollo client

00:20:26.099 --> 00:20:31.199
Caption: or route query or things like that again

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.559
Caption: I&#39;m mainly working react so those are my

00:20:31.199 --> 00:20:33.558
Caption: examples

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.418
Caption: so appended a pretty Rosy picture about

00:20:37.678 --> 00:20:40.678
Caption: you know how easy it is to make an

00:20:39.418 --> 00:20:43.918
Caption: offline app

00:20:40.678 --> 00:20:46.619
Caption: and there are a bunch of challenges

00:20:43.918 --> 00:20:48.739
Caption: uh we&#39;re going to talk about them a fair

00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:51.818
Caption: bit after I&#39;ve had a drink

00:20:48.739 --> 00:20:51.818
Caption: [Music]

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.719
Caption: so when you talk about offline apps one

00:20:55.678 --> 00:20:59.819
Caption: of the big ones that big challenges that

00:20:57.719 --> 00:21:01.979
Caption: people will raise is the idea of getting

00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:03.479
Caption: a merge conflict now developers are

00:21:01.979 --> 00:21:05.760
Caption: pretty familiar with most conflicts

00:21:03.479 --> 00:21:07.140
Caption: because we get them all the time when

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.839
Caption: we&#39;re writing code

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:12.780
Caption: and you won&#39;t find many people in the

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:15.779
Caption: room who actually enjoy that process

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:17.520
Caption: but it&#39;s not necessarily as big a deal

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.479
Caption: as people think it is with an offline

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.580
Caption: app

00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:21.780
Caption: so I&#39;ll just run through a little bit of

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:24.178
Caption: what a most conflict is because it&#39;s a

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:26.280
Caption: complicated idea if you&#39;re not familiar

00:21:24.178 --> 00:21:28.019
Caption: basically emerge conflict happens when

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.419
Caption: two people change the same thing around

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:33.359
Caption: the same time

00:21:30.418 --> 00:21:37.019
Caption: so in this case we&#39;ve got Alice and Bob

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:40.260
Caption: Alice opens a thing saves the changes

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:42.839
Caption: and in that in between phase Bob has

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.099
Caption: also opened the thing and he saves some

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:45.538
Caption: changes

00:21:44.099 --> 00:21:47.280
Caption: now when you get to the end if they&#39;ve

00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:49.558
Caption: made different changes

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.940
Caption: you need to figure out what to do

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:53.219
Caption: essentially

00:21:50.939 --> 00:21:56.459
Caption: so there&#39;s a kind of an important line

00:21:53.219 --> 00:21:58.439
Caption: we can draw in the sand which is when

00:21:56.459 --> 00:22:00.000
Caption: that first person saves it

00:21:58.439 --> 00:22:02.038
Caption: the person who goes after that will get

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.918
Caption: a problem

00:22:02.038 --> 00:22:06.719
Caption: uh now I&#39;ve got the lines roughly in

00:22:04.918 --> 00:22:09.199
Caption: this kind of range but really they can

00:22:06.719 --> 00:22:12.479
Caption: be anywhere

00:22:09.199 --> 00:22:14.639
Caption: essentially if you open it before that

00:22:12.479 --> 00:22:16.199
Caption: dotted blue line and you save it after

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.579
Caption: that dotted blue line then you have a

00:22:16.199 --> 00:22:19.678
Caption: problem if you open it and save it

00:22:17.579 --> 00:22:21.779
Caption: before the other person gets the problem

00:22:19.678 --> 00:22:22.979
Caption: or if you open it after then you&#39;re

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.200
Caption: already getting the latest updates

00:22:22.979 --> 00:22:27.418
Caption: anyway so you&#39;re not going to get that

00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:29.760
Caption: in those conflict scenario

00:22:27.418 --> 00:22:31.798
Caption: the thing is for an offline app

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.440
Caption: it&#39;s not so much about when you open it

00:22:31.798 --> 00:22:37.500
Caption: and when you save it it&#39;s more like when

00:22:34.439 --> 00:22:38.879
Caption: you were last online to get the version

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.798
Caption: at the beginning

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.819
Caption: and then when you come back online at

00:22:40.798 --> 00:22:43.979
Caption: the end

00:22:41.819 --> 00:22:45.298
Caption: so the time frame for actually getting

00:22:43.979 --> 00:22:48.239
Caption: emerged conflict when you have an

00:22:45.298 --> 00:22:50.579
Caption: offline app is quite a lot bigger

00:22:48.239 --> 00:22:53.760
Caption: but the problem is existing no matter

00:22:50.579 --> 00:22:55.739
Caption: what you know even if it you&#39;ve got a

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.719
Caption: thing that takes 10 seconds to fill out

00:22:55.739 --> 00:23:00.000
Caption: but it&#39;s still a 10 second window where

00:22:57.719 --> 00:23:02.459
Caption: someone might open it and hit this

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.859
Caption: problem so you already do something

00:23:02.459 --> 00:23:06.479
Caption: about merge conflicts you probably just

00:23:04.859 --> 00:23:08.520
Caption: haven&#39;t thought about it

00:23:06.479 --> 00:23:11.158
Caption: uh common things that you might find

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.558
Caption: there would be that the last update wins

00:23:11.159 --> 00:23:15.059
Caption: because they make the change last so

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:17.099
Caption: just overwrite whatever was in there

00:23:15.058 --> 00:23:19.678
Caption: with what they put

00:23:17.099 --> 00:23:22.140
Caption: hopefully uh some of the changes will be

00:23:19.678 --> 00:23:24.538
Caption: the same so actually doesn&#39;t matter if

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.979
Caption: that if that happened or not

00:23:24.538 --> 00:23:28.798
Caption: but there are other approaches you can

00:23:25.979 --> 00:23:31.079
Caption: use where rather than say hey here&#39;s

00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:33.899
Caption: this whole thing you know here&#39;s a title

00:23:31.079 --> 00:23:36.058
Caption: and description and some tags on how to

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.099
Caption: do

00:23:36.058 --> 00:23:39.839
Caption: go and replace whatever was there you

00:23:38.099 --> 00:23:42.538
Caption: could actually just say all right you

00:23:39.839 --> 00:23:44.880
Caption: changed the description so let&#39;s update

00:23:42.538 --> 00:23:46.739
Caption: the description and that limits the

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.359
Caption: amount of most comic books you&#39;ll get

00:23:46.739 --> 00:23:50.880
Caption: and the idea behind that&#39;s kind of like

00:23:48.359 --> 00:23:52.979
Caption: a patch operation

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.140
Caption: um because it&#39;s a HTTP patch keyword and

00:23:52.979 --> 00:23:56.579
Caption: an RFC and all this fun stuff around

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:59.039
Caption: that

00:23:56.579 --> 00:24:00.239
Caption: but basically most conflicts are a

00:23:59.038 --> 00:24:02.879
Caption: problem and you do need to think about

00:24:00.239 --> 00:24:04.918
Caption: them but they&#39;re already a problem so

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.659
Caption: going offline doesn&#39;t really change it

00:24:04.918 --> 00:24:08.658
Caption: except that you might hit it more

00:24:09.839 --> 00:24:15.000
Caption: another one is API versioning and

00:24:13.439 --> 00:24:16.139
Caption: backwards compatibility and those kind

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.979
Caption: of concerns

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:22.558
Caption: because you may have had an app that was

00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:24.959
Caption: yeah last online

00:24:22.558 --> 00:24:27.538
Caption: three weeks ago if you&#39;ve changed the

00:24:24.959 --> 00:24:30.239
Caption: API in that three-week period and done a

00:24:27.538 --> 00:24:32.759
Caption: breaking change then anyone who comes

00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:34.199
Caption: back online from three weeks ago

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.760
Caption: yeah the things they&#39;re trying to do

00:24:34.199 --> 00:24:37.678
Caption: won&#39;t work because

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.678
Caption: they might be missing required fields or

00:24:37.678 --> 00:24:44.459
Caption: that kind of thing right so it becomes

00:24:40.678 --> 00:24:46.619
Caption: more important that you accept

00:24:44.459 --> 00:24:48.658
Caption: um backwards compatible like old

00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:51.359
Caption: versions of stuff so I don&#39;t know you

00:24:48.659 --> 00:24:53.640
Caption: add a new field to your to-do that&#39;s

00:24:51.359 --> 00:24:55.979
Caption: called assignee or something

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.380
Caption: and then if you make it a required field

00:24:55.979 --> 00:25:00.418
Caption: anyone who doesn&#39;t provide an assignee

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.798
Caption: it&#39;ll fail that&#39;s kind of a problem

00:25:00.418 --> 00:25:04.439
Caption: right so you still need a way for

00:25:01.798 --> 00:25:07.019
Caption: someone to do that job without that

00:25:04.439 --> 00:25:08.819
Caption: field and a common approach to that is

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:11.039
Caption: having API versioning there are a bunch

00:25:08.819 --> 00:25:12.779
Caption: of other ways as well but

00:25:11.038 --> 00:25:16.678
Caption: again that&#39;s going to depend on what you

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:18.239
Caption: uh where your app works

00:25:16.678 --> 00:25:19.619
Caption: you&#39;ll notice a common theme around

00:25:18.239 --> 00:25:21.599
Caption: these that they&#39;re all related to

00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:22.979
Caption: handling errors because when everything

00:25:21.599 --> 00:25:24.798
Caption: works

00:25:22.979 --> 00:25:28.140
Caption: everything works and everything&#39;s easy

00:25:24.798 --> 00:25:29.699
Caption: the problem is when there are problems

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.760
Caption: so another one is things like field

00:25:29.699 --> 00:25:35.158
Caption: validation you know if you have a

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.140
Caption: required field that you&#39;ve added

00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:39.840
Caption: whether it existed before or exists

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:43.260
Caption: later essentially

00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:46.079
Caption: if you rely on the server to validate

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:48.178
Caption: these requests that you&#39;re making

00:25:46.079 --> 00:25:50.219
Caption: before like rather than letting the

00:25:48.178 --> 00:25:53.099
Caption: client do it that means your offline

00:25:50.219 --> 00:25:55.260
Caption: user has to wait potentially weeks until

00:25:53.099 --> 00:25:57.719
Caption: they actually try and do the thing

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.859
Caption: and then it fails so that&#39;s a problem

00:25:57.719 --> 00:26:01.859
Caption: because

00:25:58.859 --> 00:26:05.579
Caption: to go and add a required field when you

00:26:01.859 --> 00:26:08.158
Caption: press submit is pretty easy right but if

00:26:05.579 --> 00:26:10.019
Caption: you&#39;re revisiting it weeks days hours

00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:12.419
Caption: even later

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:15.359
Caption: it&#39;s a lot harder to to know what the

00:26:12.418 --> 00:26:17.839
Caption: right thing to put in is there put in

00:26:15.359 --> 00:26:17.839
Caption: there it&#39;s

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:23.520
Caption: so I talked about the um the offline

00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:25.020
Caption: queue or the the queue of changes to

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.119
Caption: make so we&#39;ve got a little

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.940
Caption: animation thing that I&#39;m pretty proud of

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:32.760
Caption: that I made here basically here on that

00:26:29.939 --> 00:26:34.918
Caption: process so this little box is going to

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.940
Caption: be our magical processor and all the

00:26:34.918 --> 00:26:38.699
Caption: little

00:26:35.939 --> 00:26:40.199
Caption: rectangles uh other things we&#39;re going

00:26:38.699 --> 00:26:41.819
Caption: to do with them so we start by

00:26:40.199 --> 00:26:43.918
Caption: processing one and we take the next one

00:26:41.819 --> 00:26:47.519
Caption: process that

00:26:43.918 --> 00:26:49.259
Caption: take the next one and it&#39;s failed

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.419
Caption: so

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.579
Caption: if you went to Derek&#39;s talk earlier he

00:26:51.418 --> 00:26:55.918
Caption: talked a lot about you know retries and

00:26:53.579 --> 00:26:58.140
Caption: timeouts and exponential back off and

00:26:55.918 --> 00:27:00.058
Caption: those kind of things and yeah you

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:02.039
Caption: probably do want to retry these requests

00:27:00.058 --> 00:27:03.359
Caption: because they might just be intermittent

00:27:02.038 --> 00:27:06.359
Caption: errors

00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:09.239
Caption: if they&#39;re not intermittent errors then

00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:12.298
Caption: you retry it and it will always fail so

00:27:09.239 --> 00:27:14.579
Caption: what do you do if you talk about a queue

00:27:12.298 --> 00:27:16.439
Caption: then there&#39;s this idea that you process

00:27:14.579 --> 00:27:18.178
Caption: them in the order they came in but this

00:27:16.439 --> 00:27:21.058
Caption: one is now stuck

00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:23.599
Caption: so you need something to essentially put

00:27:21.058 --> 00:27:23.599
Caption: that aside

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.459
Caption: and then

00:27:27.959 --> 00:27:30.538
Caption: you can continue pressing the rest of

00:27:29.459 --> 00:27:33.000
Caption: them

00:27:30.538 --> 00:27:37.319
Caption: now you&#39;re not done yet that one that

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Caption: you didn&#39;t process is still

00:27:37.319 --> 00:27:40.798
Caption: valid it&#39;s still something that someone

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.640
Caption: tried to do and it didn&#39;t work so you

00:27:40.798 --> 00:27:47.939
Caption: need a way for them to resume that

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:50.820
Caption: um it&#39;ll depend on again what the app is

00:27:47.939 --> 00:27:52.439
Caption: and and what you expect it to do

00:27:50.819 --> 00:27:54.719
Caption: but

00:27:52.439 --> 00:27:56.278
Caption: basically we need to try and reproduce

00:27:54.719 --> 00:27:57.959
Caption: it again in a different way so that

00:27:56.279 --> 00:27:59.880
Caption: might be saying you can go back in and

00:27:57.959 --> 00:28:01.558
Caption: edit and try again

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.900
Caption: or you

00:28:01.558 --> 00:28:05.880
Caption: save it to some API and get an admin

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.979
Caption: team to process them

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:11.279
Caption: or you just roll it back and say hey

00:28:07.979 --> 00:28:14.599
Caption: sorry we couldn&#39;t do that throw it away

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:17.220
Caption: again depends on what your data is

00:28:14.599 --> 00:28:20.178
Caption: but the kind of robustness of this

00:28:17.219 --> 00:28:22.739
Caption: process is is really important because

00:28:20.178 --> 00:28:25.500
Caption: it&#39;s called your app now so whereas

00:28:22.739 --> 00:28:28.140
Caption: before in offline mode it may have been

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:30.000
Caption: there and you didn&#39;t spend all of your

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.859
Caption: effort building it

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.140
Caption: you know maybe you get some problems and

00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:35.640
Caption: and it&#39;s sort of okay because when

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.859
Caption: they&#39;re online it works

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.119
Caption: but for an offline First Step this is

00:28:37.859 --> 00:28:41.038
Caption: the only way you get those updates

00:28:39.119 --> 00:28:43.918
Caption: happening so

00:28:41.038 --> 00:28:46.678
Caption: again make it robust uh you need to

00:28:43.918 --> 00:28:48.538
Caption: think about things like having an item

00:28:46.678 --> 00:28:51.119
Caption: potency on your requests

00:28:48.538 --> 00:28:53.519
Caption: for example if this was a delete that

00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:56.099
Caption: failed because the thing was already

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.719
Caption: deleted you could go well you&#39;re trying

00:28:56.099 --> 00:29:00.058
Caption: to delete it and it&#39;s deleted so it&#39;s

00:28:57.719 --> 00:29:01.918
Caption: fine and just mark it as successful

00:29:00.058 --> 00:29:04.619
Caption: basically

00:29:01.918 --> 00:29:06.359
Caption: and you might also have the dependent

00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:07.140
Caption: requests in here so let&#39;s say this was a

00:29:06.359 --> 00:29:09.599
Caption: create

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.820
Caption: and then later add an update that update

00:29:09.599 --> 00:29:14.099
Caption: would also fail because it&#39;s got nothing

00:29:11.819 --> 00:29:15.959
Caption: to update now so

00:29:14.099 --> 00:29:18.739
Caption: they might you might finally get a few

00:29:15.959 --> 00:29:18.739
Caption: of these things happening

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:23.339
Caption: another problem is when you have a

00:29:21.899 --> 00:29:26.279
Caption: patchy internet connection or an

00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:27.778
Caption: unreliable connection rather than being

00:29:26.279 --> 00:29:30.720
Caption: just offline

00:29:27.779 --> 00:29:33.240
Caption: so it&#39;s actually kind of worse

00:29:30.719 --> 00:29:34.859
Caption: you could look at the things like

00:29:33.239 --> 00:29:36.058
Caption: on your device they often have

00:29:34.859 --> 00:29:37.500
Caption: indicators that say whether you&#39;re

00:29:36.058 --> 00:29:40.558
Caption: online or offline

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.119
Caption: but how reliable are they actually you

00:29:40.558 --> 00:29:44.398
Caption: might want to put in something like a

00:29:42.119 --> 00:29:46.319
Caption: health check endpoint on your API where

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:48.779
Caption: you can call that to see

00:29:46.319 --> 00:29:50.939
Caption: like the device says them online but can

00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:51.960
Caption: I actually call the apis that I need to

00:29:50.939 --> 00:29:54.479
Caption: call

00:29:51.959 --> 00:29:56.579
Caption: and then you know base it on that you

00:29:54.479 --> 00:29:59.939
Caption: might want to consider

00:29:56.579 --> 00:30:01.380
Caption: having the app like manually try and

00:29:59.939 --> 00:30:04.079
Caption: sync up rather than doing it

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.760
Caption: automatically so the user can say yeah I

00:30:04.079 --> 00:30:07.619
Caption: want to sync now but again that doesn&#39;t

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.779
Caption: work for everyone but it&#39;s an approach

00:30:07.619 --> 00:30:13.079
Caption: that you could take to handle this

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:15.059
Caption: problem so rather than just responding

00:30:13.079 --> 00:30:17.158
Caption: to being online you can wait until the

00:30:15.058 --> 00:30:19.798
Caption: person who&#39;s like yeah I&#39;m back in the

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:23.059
Caption: office now so I can

00:30:19.798 --> 00:30:23.058
Caption: do the thing and it should work

00:30:26.939 --> 00:30:30.898
Caption: another thing is when you have an

00:30:28.678 --> 00:30:32.278
Caption: offline app you probably need to tell

00:30:30.899 --> 00:30:34.799
Caption: your users

00:30:32.279 --> 00:30:37.919
Caption: that it&#39;s offline and

00:30:34.798 --> 00:30:39.538
Caption: uh you could say something like you&#39;re

00:30:37.918 --> 00:30:40.619
Caption: offline

00:30:39.538 --> 00:30:43.439
Caption: but do they know what that actually

00:30:40.619 --> 00:30:45.658
Caption: means so rather than just say you&#39;re

00:30:43.439 --> 00:30:47.939
Caption: offline you might want to change it up a

00:30:45.659 --> 00:30:50.159
Caption: little and say something like you&#39;re

00:30:47.939 --> 00:30:51.479
Caption: offline changes will be saved when

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:53.520
Caption: you&#39;re back online

00:30:51.479 --> 00:30:55.678
Caption: that kind of hints that

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.000
Caption: oh I&#39;m not done just because I think I&#39;m

00:30:55.678 --> 00:30:59.278
Caption: done

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.619
Caption: there&#39;s something else I&#39;ll need to do

00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:03.480
Caption: again you talk to whoever about the

00:31:01.619 --> 00:31:05.520
Caption: exact wording there but

00:31:03.479 --> 00:31:07.079
Caption: there&#39;s that kind of idea where

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.380
Caption: telling them what the state is doesn&#39;t

00:31:07.079 --> 00:31:12.058
Caption: help tell them what they can do about it

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.459
Caption: and then as you go through you might say

00:31:12.058 --> 00:31:15.380
Caption: we&#39;ve got three changes pending upload

00:31:14.459 --> 00:31:18.119
Caption: or

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:20.819
Caption: we&#39;ve uploaded five of eight of your

00:31:18.119 --> 00:31:22.380
Caption: changes or you know all changes are

00:31:20.819 --> 00:31:24.959
Caption: saved at the end

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:27.298
Caption: just to help the users understand that

00:31:24.959 --> 00:31:30.599
Caption: yes you&#39;re offline

00:31:27.298 --> 00:31:32.579
Caption: and what does it mean for you now you

00:31:30.599 --> 00:31:34.199
Caption: know are you done yet when you get this

00:31:32.579 --> 00:31:36.239
Caption: kind of message it&#39;s like oh cool

00:31:34.199 --> 00:31:39.058
Caption: everything I&#39;ve saved everything I&#39;ve

00:31:36.239 --> 00:31:42.619
Caption: changed has been saved so I can go about

00:31:39.058 --> 00:31:42.619
Caption: my day everything&#39;s normal

00:31:42.839 --> 00:31:47.339
Caption: another one that will be affected by

00:31:45.298 --> 00:31:49.199
Caption: having an offline app

00:31:47.339 --> 00:31:51.959
Caption: is that

00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:54.619
Caption: the security posture of the Europe

00:31:51.959 --> 00:31:54.619
Caption: changes

00:31:54.899 --> 00:31:57.179
Caption: um

00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:00.199
Caption: because you&#39;re getting all this data

00:31:57.178 --> 00:32:00.199
Caption: onto your device

00:32:00.239 --> 00:32:03.899
Caption: is potential that someone else could get

00:32:02.339 --> 00:32:05.520
Caption: that data off the device

00:32:03.899 --> 00:32:07.200
Caption: so you might want to think about things

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.899
Caption: like encryption

00:32:07.199 --> 00:32:12.359
Caption: if that&#39;s important if you do have

00:32:09.899 --> 00:32:15.179
Caption: encryption then where do you store the

00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:18.599
Caption: encryption keys if they&#39;re also on the

00:32:15.178 --> 00:32:21.058
Caption: device then it might be a little I don&#39;t

00:32:18.599 --> 00:32:23.158
Caption: know pointless to have the key stored

00:32:21.058 --> 00:32:25.380
Caption: with the data

00:32:23.159 --> 00:32:28.380
Caption: so you think about how that&#39;s going to

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:30.659
Caption: work for you another big one is if you

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:33.539
Caption: have shared devices

00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:35.220
Caption: uh let&#39;s say Yeah in a workplace it

00:32:33.538 --> 00:32:37.739
Caption: might be there&#39;s a kiosk thing that

00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:39.658
Caption: people use to do a job

00:32:37.739 --> 00:32:40.918
Caption: and when someone shift ends they hand it

00:32:39.659 --> 00:32:42.240
Caption: over to someone else and they&#39;ll go do

00:32:40.918 --> 00:32:44.759
Caption: their job too

00:32:42.239 --> 00:32:46.798
Caption: so if there&#39;s kind of user data on there

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.659
Caption: you might need to think about

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:51.019
Caption: keeping it separate from the other users

00:32:48.659 --> 00:32:51.020
Caption: data

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.320
Caption: it&#39;s going to defend right maybe it&#39;s

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.880
Caption: fine for them to see it maybe it&#39;s not

00:32:55.319 --> 00:32:58.019
Caption: really user sensitive but if you&#39;re

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.940
Caption: storing

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.440
Caption: you know their name or date of birth or

00:32:59.939 --> 00:33:04.798
Caption: something somewhere

00:33:01.439 --> 00:33:06.298
Caption: then you might want to hide it as well

00:33:04.798 --> 00:33:08.880
Caption: so that&#39;s where encryption would come in

00:33:06.298 --> 00:33:11.339
Caption: and all the other fun things

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:14.159
Caption: and then another kind of complicated

00:33:11.339 --> 00:33:16.319
Caption: issue is that most of the apps that we

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:17.760
Caption: build especially if you&#39;re going for you

00:33:16.319 --> 00:33:18.839
Caption: know Enterprise kind of clients or

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.000
Caption: whatever

00:33:18.839 --> 00:33:25.140
Caption: you&#39;ll need some kind of authorization

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:28.199
Caption: and authentication some like login stuff

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:31.320
Caption: now when you&#39;re online you can log in

00:33:28.199 --> 00:33:33.418
Caption: and get refresh tokens and you know have

00:33:31.319 --> 00:33:36.599
Caption: a token lifetime to last an hour

00:33:33.418 --> 00:33:38.219
Caption: and then you go and get a refreshed

00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:40.439
Caption: version every hour so that you don&#39;t

00:33:38.219 --> 00:33:42.898
Caption: never run out right

00:33:40.439 --> 00:33:45.418
Caption: if you&#39;re offline you can&#39;t do that

00:33:42.899 --> 00:33:47.880
Caption: anymore so you might need to think about

00:33:45.418 --> 00:33:49.439
Caption: how you need to relax those those rules

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:52.079
Caption: those guidelines

00:33:49.439 --> 00:33:54.119
Caption: just to handle that scenario so

00:33:52.079 --> 00:33:55.500
Caption: you might let people in if their tokens

00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:57.479
Caption: expired

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.979
Caption: and maybe only for a certain amount of

00:33:57.479 --> 00:34:00.418
Caption: time

00:33:58.979 --> 00:34:02.518
Caption: but it&#39;s probably something you need

00:34:00.418 --> 00:34:06.058
Caption: otherwise they can&#39;t go offline to more

00:34:02.519 --> 00:34:07.380
Caption: than an hour right so it would depend

00:34:06.058 --> 00:34:10.439
Caption: again

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:13.439
Caption: I&#39;m a consultant so it always depends

00:34:10.439 --> 00:34:15.358
Caption: but if you think about how what it means

00:34:13.439 --> 00:34:17.219
Caption: for you you know maybe you let people in

00:34:15.358 --> 00:34:18.719
Caption: and then before you actually save

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:21.658
Caption: anything you do go and get that new

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:24.178
Caption: token so that it all works

00:34:21.658 --> 00:34:26.418
Caption: but that&#39;s the sort of thing you need to

00:34:24.178 --> 00:34:26.418
Caption: think about

00:34:27.118 --> 00:34:31.378
Caption: another one I&#39;ve I&#39;ve got another

00:34:29.099 --> 00:34:33.659
Caption: challenge is you want to build

00:34:31.378 --> 00:34:35.719
Caption: an offline web app so you could have

00:34:33.658 --> 00:34:37.979
Caption: like a mobile app which has its own

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:40.678
Caption: challenges potentially

00:34:37.979 --> 00:34:43.378
Caption: but a web app is probably even bigger

00:34:40.678 --> 00:34:45.300
Caption: because the convention is that you would

00:34:43.378 --> 00:34:47.279
Caption: download everything essentially every

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.199
Caption: time you visit the app yeah you might

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.379
Caption: have coaching of style sheets and stuff

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:54.479
Caption: through your CDN but if you&#39;re going to

00:34:52.378 --> 00:34:56.158
Caption: have a fully offline app you need to

00:34:54.479 --> 00:34:58.260
Caption: have that data saved on the device

00:34:56.158 --> 00:35:00.419
Caption: always

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.159
Caption: so there are things to to help you with

00:35:00.419 --> 00:35:05.760
Caption: that now like if you build a progressive

00:35:02.159 --> 00:35:07.260
Caption: web app a pwa then you get a lot of that

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.060
Caption: stuff built in you have a service worker

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:12.060
Caption: download all the assets so for later

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:13.800
Caption: right it&#39;s not impossible but it is a

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:16.739
Caption: little bit more difficult probably than

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.239
Caption: a native app because the native apps let

00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:19.679
Caption: you download all that stuff ahead of

00:35:18.239 --> 00:35:22.679
Caption: time anyway you know you download your

00:35:19.679 --> 00:35:25.679
Caption: app from the App Store and it&#39;s 50

00:35:22.679 --> 00:35:27.540
Caption: megabytes or whatever it is and all the

00:35:25.679 --> 00:35:28.979
Caption: stuff that you need there is included

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.400
Caption: whereas on the web you download that

00:35:28.979 --> 00:35:31.399
Caption: every time

00:35:32.879 --> 00:35:37.259
Caption: and then the last sort of challenge

00:35:35.879 --> 00:35:41.098
Caption: that I&#39;ve

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:42.959
Caption: I&#39;ve got to cover I guess is uh

00:35:41.099 --> 00:35:44.940
Caption: those features that just won&#39;t work so

00:35:42.959 --> 00:35:46.139
Caption: you know this is video streaming right

00:35:44.939 --> 00:35:49.679
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s not going to work you

00:35:46.139 --> 00:35:52.858
Caption: can&#39;t build teams of Zoom

00:35:49.679 --> 00:35:54.540
Caption: if you&#39;re going for an offline app those

00:35:52.858 --> 00:35:57.118
Caption: features just won&#39;t work so there are

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.579
Caption: there are limits

00:35:57.118 --> 00:36:01.199
Caption: now

00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:03.060
Caption: we&#39;ve talked a bunch about the benefits

00:36:01.199 --> 00:36:04.679
Caption: and the challenges that have come with

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:07.439
Caption: this

00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:08.760
Caption: uh we&#39;ve talked about why you might want

00:36:07.439 --> 00:36:10.500
Caption: to build one so if you want to be used

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:14.040
Caption: in remote areas

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:16.079
Caption: or just in situational offline times you

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.479
Caption: know someone&#39;s probably got a Wi-Fi only

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:19.979
Caption: tablet or something if you wanted to

00:36:18.479 --> 00:36:22.199
Caption: bring that here and it didn&#39;t work

00:36:19.979 --> 00:36:24.598
Caption: because you didn&#39;t connect to the

00:36:22.199 --> 00:36:28.159
Caption: uh venue Wi-Fi or the venue Wi-Fi was

00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:28.160
Caption: bad then you&#39;d have a bad time

00:36:28.739 --> 00:36:32.939
Caption: and the benefits I guess are that you

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:35.699
Caption: get a better experience for users they

00:36:32.939 --> 00:36:38.060
Caption: can use your app in more ways in more

00:36:35.699 --> 00:36:38.060
Caption: places

00:36:39.719 --> 00:36:43.739
Caption: and yeah we had to acknowledge that

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.239
Caption: there are challenges with that so I&#39;m

00:36:43.739 --> 00:36:47.699
Caption: not saying it&#39;s easier to build an

00:36:45.239 --> 00:36:49.439
Caption: offline app than an online one

00:36:47.699 --> 00:36:51.358
Caption: but if you think that you&#39;re going to

00:36:49.439 --> 00:36:53.520
Caption: build an offline app

00:36:51.358 --> 00:36:55.439
Caption: or you know you&#39;re going to build an

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.119
Caption: offline app or even if you just want to

00:36:55.439 --> 00:37:00.000
Caption: build an offline app

00:36:57.118 --> 00:37:04.500
Caption: then it&#39;s definitely easier to adopt

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.839
Caption: that online sorry offline first mindset

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:09.719
Caption: and treat it as the normal rather than

00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:11.760
Caption: trying to

00:37:09.719 --> 00:37:13.199
Caption: um trying to handle it later you know

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:16.699
Caption: it&#39;s easy to know up front what you&#39;re

00:37:13.199 --> 00:37:16.699
Caption: building and build it from the beginning

00:37:17.099 --> 00:37:21.300
Caption: so that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got today

00:37:19.858 --> 00:37:23.219
Caption: I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d have time for

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.920
Caption: questions but I think I actually do so

00:37:23.219 --> 00:37:27.838
Caption: if anyone does have a couple

00:37:24.919 --> 00:37:29.939
Caption: uh thank you

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:34.909
Caption: foreign

00:37:29.939 --> 00:37:34.908
Caption: [Applause]

00:37:37.579 --> 00:37:40.760
Caption: yes hello

00:37:42.659 --> 00:37:46.639
Caption: I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a mic but go out

00:37:44.159 --> 00:37:46.639
Caption: and I&#39;ll repeat

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.618
Caption: that cool so the question was how would

00:37:59.579 --> 00:38:02.780
Caption: basically how do you encrypt data on the

00:38:01.618 --> 00:38:05.358
Caption: client side

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:07.919
Caption: uh so

00:38:05.358 --> 00:38:09.419
Caption: there are many ways to encrypt let&#39;s

00:38:07.919 --> 00:38:11.760
Caption: assume you&#39;ve got like a public private

00:38:09.419 --> 00:38:14.760
Caption: key pair or something which is a pretty

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:18.599
Caption: standard way to do it you would

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:20.699
Caption: essentially probably rather than

00:38:18.599 --> 00:38:22.920
Caption: getting the data

00:38:20.699 --> 00:38:24.838
Caption: on your device

00:38:22.919 --> 00:38:26.399
Caption: you would download it in an encrypted

00:38:24.839 --> 00:38:30.020
Caption: format

00:38:26.399 --> 00:38:32.399
Caption: um I would expect and then

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:34.320
Caption: have something on your device to decrypt

00:38:32.399 --> 00:38:36.358
Caption: it so if you have a private public key

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.180
Caption: for example the private key can stay on

00:38:36.358 --> 00:38:40.979
Caption: the server public key on your device the

00:38:39.179 --> 00:38:42.959
Caption: way those two things work is that

00:38:40.979 --> 00:38:45.358
Caption: anything encrypted by the private key

00:38:42.959 --> 00:38:47.159
Caption: can be decrypted by the public key and

00:38:45.358 --> 00:38:49.199
Caption: you can verify that that&#39;s where it came

00:38:47.159 --> 00:38:52.459
Caption: from so that does kind of give you that

00:38:49.199 --> 00:38:54.719
Caption: option to to download the data

00:38:52.459 --> 00:38:56.699
Caption: uh if you&#39;re going to do something like

00:38:54.719 --> 00:38:58.919
Caption: encryption that will probably

00:38:56.699 --> 00:39:01.560
Caption: dramatically slow down the app because

00:38:58.919 --> 00:39:04.020
Caption: you&#39;ll have to decrypt it

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:06.300
Caption: all the time and there are going to be

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:08.579
Caption: gaps where it&#39;s in memory and stuff so

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.560
Caption: when they talk about those kind of hacks

00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:12.359
Caption: like um I&#39;m trying to think of the names

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.760
Caption: of them but they have all these memory

00:39:12.358 --> 00:39:16.439
Caption: overflow like buffer overflow attacks

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.939
Caption: and stuff you&#39;re probably still going to

00:39:16.439 --> 00:39:20.219
Caption: be vulnerable to that kind of stuff it&#39;s

00:39:17.939 --> 00:39:23.000
Caption: not a perfect solution but there&#39;s

00:39:20.219 --> 00:39:23.000
Caption: something there right

00:39:24.358 --> 00:39:29.539
Caption: cool another one

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.540
Caption: foreign

00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:46.980
Caption: yeah so

00:39:44.639 --> 00:39:48.299
Caption: when we stopped waiting for the response

00:39:46.979 --> 00:39:49.500
Caption: and we just kind of updated the

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:53.280
Caption: background

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:55.139
Caption: uh yeah like like you said you would get

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.520
Caption: your stale data first and then you&#39;d

00:39:55.139 --> 00:39:58.319
Caption: replace it with the new data when it

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.880
Caption: came in so it wouldn&#39;t always have

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.040
Caption: changed and you might see no difference

00:39:59.879 --> 00:40:03.899
Caption: but yeah if it did change you&#39;d have to

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.239
Caption: handle that so again that&#39;s going to

00:40:03.899 --> 00:40:08.760
Caption: depend how you want to handle it if

00:40:06.239 --> 00:40:10.919
Caption: you&#39;re okay with it being

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.959
Caption: yeah initially styled data and then

00:40:10.919 --> 00:40:16.020
Caption: getting the updated data I guess if you

00:40:12.959 --> 00:40:20.060
Caption: don&#39;t fetch that data then you would

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:20.060
Caption: always get a stale one so

00:40:40.739 --> 00:40:43.520
Caption: is gonna

00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:55.980
Caption: yeah so the idea being that if you kind

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.839
Caption: of do that process we update it after

00:40:55.979 --> 00:40:59.699
Caption: the fact that there&#39;s stale data does it

00:40:57.839 --> 00:41:02.239
Caption: always make sense to do that

00:40:59.699 --> 00:41:02.239
Caption: so

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.339
Caption: yeah

00:41:03.479 --> 00:41:06.838
Caption: so something like let&#39;s say in the top

00:41:05.339 --> 00:41:07.980
Caption: right you&#39;ve got a user Avatar or

00:41:06.839 --> 00:41:09.480
Caption: something right if that just updates

00:41:07.979 --> 00:41:11.219
Caption: randomly it doesn&#39;t matter

00:41:09.479 --> 00:41:13.618
Caption: uh if you&#39;ve just clicked to open

00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:15.118
Caption: something and that updates later like

00:41:13.618 --> 00:41:18.118
Caption: you said it might be jarring where

00:41:15.118 --> 00:41:19.019
Caption: everything changes on them you know

00:41:18.118 --> 00:41:21.019
Caption: um

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:23.399
Caption: you&#39;ll have to decide what works for you

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:25.679
Caption: potentially you just update lists of

00:41:23.399 --> 00:41:28.078
Caption: things like that so you see the old list

00:41:25.679 --> 00:41:31.500
Caption: first and then the new one loads in

00:41:28.079 --> 00:41:34.440
Caption: there are kind of balances I guess

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:38.358
Caption: it depends but I hate to say that all

00:41:34.439 --> 00:41:38.358
Caption: the time but it generally does depend

00:41:38.699 --> 00:41:44.780
Caption: cool one more maybe hello

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:44.780
Caption: gosh sorry

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:58.199
Caption: um I don&#39;t have any particular thoughts

00:41:56.339 --> 00:42:00.000
Caption: on that I guess

00:41:58.199 --> 00:42:02.280
Caption: um if it&#39;s

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.419
Caption: capable of being offline which is

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.400
Caption: everything right they&#39;ve all got an

00:42:03.419 --> 00:42:07.520
Caption: airplane mode

00:42:05.399 --> 00:42:07.520
Caption: um

00:42:08.339 --> 00:42:14.220
Caption: yeah okay yep so

00:42:11.939 --> 00:42:15.838
Caption: if I guess it&#39;s something I was probably

00:42:14.219 --> 00:42:17.820
Caption: meant to talk about but didn&#39;t

00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:19.320
Caption: um if you&#39;re going to download gigabytes

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.579
Caption: of data then you&#39;re probably going to

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.160
Caption: have a bad time because it&#39;s all going

00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:24.839
Caption: to be on the device so think about

00:42:23.159 --> 00:42:26.338
Caption: maybe you only load the last month of

00:42:24.839 --> 00:42:30.239
Caption: data or something like that you don&#39;t

00:42:26.339 --> 00:42:30.900
Caption: necessarily need everything from history

00:42:30.239 --> 00:42:32.760
Caption: um

00:42:30.899 --> 00:42:34.439
Caption: you might just need stuff that&#39;s

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.359
Caption: relevant to do your job today while

00:42:34.439 --> 00:42:37.979
Caption: you&#39;re offline so it could be a very

00:42:36.358 --> 00:42:39.719
Caption: small set or it could be quite a large

00:42:37.979 --> 00:42:41.899
Caption: set of things you actually need to

00:42:39.719 --> 00:42:41.899
Caption: download

00:42:43.199 --> 00:42:47.280
Caption: cool all right I think we&#39;re probably

00:42:44.879 --> 00:42:48.299
Caption: done it&#39;s lunch next so I&#39;ll wait up

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.679
Caption: there and if you have more questions

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.320
Caption: come see me

00:42:49.679 --> 00:42:55.319
Caption: um otherwise enjoy your food

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.320
