  "description": "Big Data was the big, exciting buzzword of the 2010 era. Everywhere we looked, companies were scrambling to utilize this illustrious beast, telling us that it represented the future of not only computing, but profitability and innovation. Look at Facebook or Google, leveraging vast quantities of information to better push ads targeting our insecurities and desires, or the multi-billion dollar companies that spawned out of it like Palantir or Visallo.\\n\\n\\nFast forward ten years, and we barely ever hear the term Big Data uttered, let alone used in our day to day life. Instead, we\u2019re getting inundated with terms like \u2018Data Lake\u2019, \u2018Data Pond\u2019, and \u2018Data Lake House\u2019. \\n\\n\\nIs this terminology built just to confuse us? Is the ominous man up there in the Cloud making up irrational terms just to peddle us new technologies we don\u2019t need, or is he just thirsty?\\n\\n\\nThis blast-from-the-present talk from a cloud-native data engineer will demystify and un-complicate the current state of \u2018Big Data\u2019, and help you impress your friends and coworkers with a knowledge of made-up sounding tech buzzwords.\\n\\nMostly intermediate\\n20 mins\\nData \\u0026 Analytics\\nStarting out my career in test automation and SaaS development, I quickly found a passion for making sense of data- the bigger and more complicated the better. While I love my career and the tech industry, I take issue with the vast amounts of complicated jargon that are used to confuse people and raise the barrier to entry.\\nA lot of the things we do aren\u0027t actually that complicated, and this gets in the way of people understanding the solutions that are there to help them.\\nFighting jargon, one acronym at a time."
