Caption: know you&#39;re all here to actually hear

00:01:01.738 --> 00:01:06.959

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.759
Caption: exciting to be here and to talk to you

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.439
Caption: all about co-pilot

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.759
Caption: so today&#39;s talk we&#39;re going to be

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.979
Caption: covering a couple of little things

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.600
Caption: before we actually go into the co-pilot

00:01:37.978 --> 00:01:41.819
Caption: side of stuff so we talk a little bit

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.258
Caption: about the idea of um AI artificial

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.779
Caption: intelligence what we&#39;re doing in the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.159
Caption: space obviously co-pilot is an AI we&#39;re

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:48.720
Caption: going to get to that in a bit

00:01:47.158 --> 00:01:51.839
Caption: talk a little bit about the applications

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.680
Caption: of AI and how it&#39;s relevant today then

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:55.379
Caption: we&#39;re obviously going to talk about

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.119
Caption: co-pilot and do a little bit of a demo

00:01:55.379 --> 00:02:00.658
Caption: I&#39;m going to finish off talking about

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.079
Caption: this idea and this concept of ownership

00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:06.298
Caption: so first up what is AI now a lot of

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.979
Caption: people here have heard about AI it&#39;s a

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.039
Caption: relatively

00:02:07.978 --> 00:02:13.199
Caption: um you know big part of computing and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.180
Caption: it&#39;s becoming bigger and bigger as

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:18.119
Caption: becoming smarter and smarter as the name

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:19.738
Caption: suggests now if you Google images of AI

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:22.979
Caption: you&#39;ll probably see this kind of stuff

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:25.020
Caption: this you know digital interface you know

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:27.059
Caption: like the whole Ironman Jarvis type stuff

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.279
Caption: is is what we kind of see if we start

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:31.199
Caption: googling but what does artificial

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:33.059
Caption: intelligence mean what is the definition

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:36.899
Caption: of artificial intelligence

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:39.539
Caption: now IBM has defined it as this

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:42.238
Caption: which is artificial intelligence

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.860
Caption: leverages computers and machines to

00:02:42.238 --> 00:02:47.039
Caption: mimic the problem-solving capabilities

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.059
Caption: and decision making of people

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:53.479
Caption: so this definition has been

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:56.759
Caption: refined over the years originally AI

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:58.199
Caption: came out of like the Turing project and

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:00.720
Caption: then it&#39;s kind of moved into more about

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:02.940
Caption: okay well now it&#39;s um you know machine

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.580
Caption: learning we&#39;re all about training models

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.919
Caption: but now we&#39;re getting into this more

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.900
Caption: stage of artificial intelligence and

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.220
Caption: back in the day when I first started

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:13.079
Caption: doing um startups one of my first

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.819
Caption: startups was actually an AI company you

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.080
Caption: see a lot of AI staffs thinking oh yeah

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.580
Caption: we&#39;re doing artificial intelligence

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.839
Caption: you&#39;re like sweet what are you doing

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.238
Caption: they&#39;re like this this and this you&#39;re

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:23.580
Caption: like yeah that&#39;s not AI that&#39;s actually

00:03:21.238 --> 00:03:25.559
Caption: machine learning so machine learning

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.440
Caption: itself is training the model and

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:31.139
Caption: teaching the things AI is now into that

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.680
Caption: more decision making process what have I

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.699
Caption: learned and what can I then use to solve

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:38.579
Caption: this problem

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:41.158
Caption: so that&#39;s where the difference is in AI

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.500
Caption: and machine learning now I think movies

00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:46.619
Caption: are a really really good way to think

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.779
Caption: about the concepts of these kind of like

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:50.518
Caption: future Tech now when we used to talk

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:52.018
Caption: about you know what&#39;s future technology

00:03:50.518 --> 00:03:54.298
Caption: going to look like oh look at movies

00:03:52.018 --> 00:03:55.679
Caption: like Back to the Future and minority

00:03:54.298 --> 00:03:58.018
Caption: Porter and wonder when that&#39;s going to

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:59.098
Caption: come in and literally the other day I

00:03:58.018 --> 00:04:00.958
Caption: was having a conversation with my

00:03:59.098 --> 00:04:02.279
Caption: housemate and he&#39;s like you know with

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.199
Caption: all this stuff you&#39;re doing really not

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:06.360
Caption: that far away from java so you might

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.458
Caption: we&#39;re actually already here

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.500
Caption: um this whole idea of java is this

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:12.059
Caption: machine not the physical part not the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.039
Caption: alternate side of it but the original

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:16.139
Caption: Iron Man side of it

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:18.779
Caption: um you know the 19 whatever movie it was

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.119
Caption: now in the back in the 90s this whole

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:22.919
Caption: idea of training this system with lots

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:25.199
Caption: of data points and it can now tell us

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.660
Caption: what to do

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.160
Caption: it can give us information from all this

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.479
Caption: understanding and all this stuff that

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.119
Caption: we&#39;ve trained it on

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.380
Caption: for example everyone&#39;s seen this hey

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:36.959
Caption: Siri

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.720
Caption: now when hey Siri and Google and Alexa

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:42.600
Caption: when they started they were kind of like

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.459
Caption: glorified search engines hey Siri how

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.619
Caption: long is the Great Wall of China who&#39;s

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:49.500
Caption: who&#39;s old enough to remember that NBN ad

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:52.320
Caption: or the Internet Ad hey Dad why did they

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.479
Caption: build a Great Wall of China oh yeah to

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.100
Caption: keep the rabbits out

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.279
Caption: and the whole thing was like give your

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.020
Caption: kids the right answer so Siri when it

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:04.199
Caption: started was this glorified search engine

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:05.519
Caption: now it&#39;s a bit more hey you know people

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.199
Caption: always say oh you know your phone&#39;s

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:08.579
Caption: listening into you well yeah it is

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.320
Caption: because it&#39;s trying to understand and

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:12.359
Caption: learn so now it doesn&#39;t just give you

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.820
Caption: information that you need to know it

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:17.039
Caption: says oh I&#39;ve also noticed that um you

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.899
Caption: played golf the other day do you need

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.899
Caption: some more golf balls because you are

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:24.959
Caption: might have lost it for you

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:27.899
Caption: so another one is um Google Nest now I

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:30.299
Caption: see this idea of the connected home the

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:32.820
Caption: connected devices Google Nest now uses

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:34.859
Caption: artificial intelligence to you in their

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.020
Caption: cameras to see if there&#39;s Intruders in

00:05:34.859 --> 00:05:39.359
Caption: your house which is I think kind of cool

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:41.099
Caption: so it&#39;s built up an image recognition of

00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:43.799
Caption: who you are and it&#39;s now learned who you

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.360
Caption: are as a person it can now detect other

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:46.559
Caption: people in the house then send you a

00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:48.299
Caption: thing saying hey we think someone else

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:49.739
Caption: is in your house based on the movement

00:05:48.299 --> 00:05:51.539
Caption: patterns of you and this other person

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:53.759
Caption: that we don&#39;t recognize we think there&#39;s

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.619
Caption: someone in your house is there some some

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.019
Caption: of the applications there

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:58.859
Caption: who drives a car here pretty much

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:00.418
Caption: everyone

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:02.219
Caption: now everyone&#39;s like when self-driving

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.899
Caption: cars coming out I&#39;m like well Ai and

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.419
Caption: machine learning has been in cars for a

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:08.220
Caption: while this idea of not just power assist

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.899
Caption: but now I&#39;ve got driver assist

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.119
Caption: you know traction controls off you know

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:15.600
Caption: you stay in the lanes get off the road

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:17.399
Caption: or stay on the road rather this idea of

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.139
Caption: driver assist right

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:21.059
Caption: and people like oh yes I can start

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.919
Caption: seeing it in our daily lives what about

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:24.600
Caption: technology

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.679
Caption: I came across this one the other day

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.020
Caption: called

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:29.039
Caption: um what was it called

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:30.599
Caption: um I can&#39;t remember the name of it

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.059
Caption: hasn&#39;t put about up here but there&#39;s a

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.819
Caption: there&#39;s a machine learning and AI

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:38.220
Caption: algorithm it&#39;s in my um resource at the

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.660
Caption: end they actually write articles for you

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.160
Caption: so you don&#39;t even need to be a

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.539
Caption: journalist anymore and outside my job at

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.039
Caption: GitHub I&#39;m a journalist and I&#39;m like oh

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:46.500
Caption: geez

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:47.579
Caption: um the computers are coming from my job

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.959
Caption: um but yeah they can they can write

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:50.159
Caption: articles

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:52.019
Caption: um there&#39;s a really really contentious

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.239
Caption: thing that popped up the other day a lot

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:56.879
Caption: of people probably seen it this idea of

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:59.459
Caption: artwork there&#39;s a famous U.S art prize

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.259
Caption: that went out and it ended up going to a

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:04.259
Caption: person who uses um use computer

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:05.699
Caption: generated imagery to create the artwork

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:07.679
Caption: now what I think is really cool about

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.720
Caption: the artwork side of things and we&#39;re

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:13.979
Caption: going to get to it in a little bit is

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:16.079
Caption: the more specific you give more

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:18.000
Caption: parameters that you give the the engine

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:20.399
Caption: the better artwork you&#39;re going to make

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.598
Caption: and I made that one on mid-journey just

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:23.579
Caption: the other day

00:07:21.598 --> 00:07:25.319
Caption: and so if you type in some fun things

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:27.059
Caption: you might get something back you&#39;re like

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:30.000
Caption: oh that&#39;s a bit weird it&#39;s not the

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:31.859
Caption: computer or the system not um like

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.019
Caption: giving you something somebody well it&#39;s

00:07:31.859 --> 00:07:37.079
Caption: a little bit dumb isn&#39;t it like well no

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:38.698
Caption: you just haven&#39;t told it what you want

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:41.339
Caption: now we&#39;re starting to see it in

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:43.919
Caption: programming we&#39;re starting to see this

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:45.959
Caption: idea of not just glorified search

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:47.880
Caption: engines coming in to help you

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:49.619
Caption: but programs that are coming in to help

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.360
Caption: you code

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:52.919
Caption: and if you have a look again it&#39;s going

00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:55.918
Caption: to be um there&#39;s a link at the end with

00:07:52.919 --> 00:08:00.240
Caption: a bunch of resources there&#39;s the top 10

00:07:55.919 --> 00:08:02.300
Caption: AI pair program or AI systems plugins

00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:05.399
Caption: that you can use for vs code

00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:09.000
Caption: one of them is Ali AI which helps you

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:11.579
Caption: understand what you&#39;ve written

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.199
Caption: yeah because because you need you need

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:15.299
Caption: to know that as a developer what kind of

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:16.440
Caption: code have I written here I actually was

00:08:15.299 --> 00:08:17.698
Caption: talking to someone the other day of

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.779
Caption: dinner and they&#39;re like yeah sometimes

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:20.459
Caption: you just don&#39;t know what you&#39;re right

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:22.919
Caption: and I&#39;m like that&#39;s where an AI pair

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:25.739
Caption: program would help now on that list they

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:28.259
Caption: obviously have GitHub co-pilot as one of

00:08:25.739 --> 00:08:30.299
Caption: the top AI extensions that you can use

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:33.359
Caption: in vs code

00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:36.778
Caption: so what is GitHub Copilot

00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:40.079
Caption: GitHub copilot is your AI pair

00:08:36.778 --> 00:08:42.898
Caption: programmer this is there to help you

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.919
Caption: build write and understand your code

00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:46.019
Caption: better

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.720
Caption: like the other extensions in vs code

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:52.700
Caption: it&#39;s built right into your editor and

00:08:48.719 --> 00:08:52.699
Caption: you can use it to help you write code

00:08:53.398 --> 00:08:59.099
Caption: now if we have a look at it here this is

00:08:56.518 --> 00:09:02.700
Caption: um a little quick example of it it&#39;s

00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:03.898
Caption: built on the AI open codex some of my

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.239
Caption: slides are actually back to front here

00:09:03.898 --> 00:09:08.278
Caption: but it&#39;s built on the AI codex I should

00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:10.619
Caption: have used Ai and copilot to write my

00:09:08.278 --> 00:09:12.599
Caption: slide deck but yeah it&#39;s built on AI

00:09:10.619 --> 00:09:15.119
Caption: codex it&#39;s trained on billions of lines

00:09:12.599 --> 00:09:17.940
Caption: of code you can see here it&#39;s suggesting

00:09:15.119 --> 00:09:21.059
Caption: this whole function

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:24.898
Caption: but unlike some of it&#39;s um predecessors

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:26.159
Caption: or pre-existing uh AI features and AI

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:29.398
Caption: functionality

00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:31.979
Caption: it&#39;s not just autocomplete

00:09:29.398 --> 00:09:34.320
Caption: it is not just saying looking at it

00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:35.579
Caption: going well hang on I think I know what

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.440
Caption: you&#39;re going to write so let me

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.760
Caption: auto-complete that for you we&#39;re having

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.398
Caption: this conversation over dinner the other

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.720
Caption: night and it was like oh isn&#39;t that the

00:09:41.398 --> 00:09:44.278
Caption: whole idea of like reducing the amount

00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:46.979
Caption: of keystrokes that you make and I was

00:09:44.278 --> 00:09:49.739
Caption: like well not really because you can

00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:51.898
Caption: either just learn a type faster or you

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:53.278
Caption: can use shortcuts like the whole idea

00:09:51.898 --> 00:09:56.159
Caption: isn&#39;t just reducing the amount of

00:09:53.278 --> 00:09:58.260
Caption: keystrokes it should be about being

00:09:56.159 --> 00:10:00.599
Caption: better programmers and actually writing

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.760
Caption: better code

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:05.039
Caption: so that&#39;s what profiler does

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.018
Caption: and it doesn&#39;t just provide you with

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:08.579
Caption: Snippets of code doesn&#39;t just say oh you

00:10:07.018 --> 00:10:10.799
Caption: know you want to write this thing here&#39;s

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.360
Caption: a snippet of code and you know I&#39;m going

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:14.039
Caption: to give you the same snippet of code and

00:10:12.359 --> 00:10:15.838
Caption: give you the same snippety code you can

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:19.079
Caption: view the same snippity code no it

00:10:15.838 --> 00:10:22.619
Caption: doesn&#39;t do that it actually uses

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:24.179
Caption: what you&#39;ve currently got in your file

00:10:22.619 --> 00:10:26.700
Caption: and what it knows about the language

00:10:24.179 --> 00:10:28.500
Caption: that you&#39;re writing and uses that

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.299
Caption: context I&#39;m saying before about if the

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.039
Caption: more parameters that you give it uses

00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:34.739
Caption: the context of what you&#39;re trying to do

00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:37.018
Caption: to actually synthesize code that&#39;s

00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:38.398
Caption: specific for you so if we all go use

00:10:37.018 --> 00:10:40.440
Caption: Copart right now we&#39;re all going to get

00:10:38.398 --> 00:10:42.359
Caption: very very different responses when we

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.518
Caption: start using it which I think is really

00:10:42.359 --> 00:10:46.679
Caption: cool

00:10:44.518 --> 00:10:49.320
Caption: one of the other ways it differs from

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:52.799
Caption: some of its pre-existing models is just

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:56.398
Caption: the sheer scale of co-pilot

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:57.898
Caption: when we work with machine learning and

00:10:56.398 --> 00:11:00.599
Caption: we&#39;re using machine learning to train

00:10:57.898 --> 00:11:03.119
Caption: artificial intelligent models

00:11:00.599 --> 00:11:05.159
Caption: one of the things that we need is lots

00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:07.679
Caption: and lots of data points

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:10.078
Caption: have you heard of like the phrase

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:11.640
Caption: dodgy data in dodgy data out

00:11:10.078 --> 00:11:14.159
Caption: so what we&#39;ve done is we haven&#39;t just

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.100
Caption: put dodgy data into it we&#39;ve used data

00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:18.659
Caption: we&#39;ve used really good quality data to

00:11:17.099 --> 00:11:21.239
Caption: train the model but we&#39;ve also used

00:11:18.659 --> 00:11:23.338
Caption: literally billions and billions of data

00:11:21.239 --> 00:11:25.820
Caption: points lots and lots of code to train

00:11:23.338 --> 00:11:25.820
Caption: this model

00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:31.619
Caption: so it is an AI pair programmer you can

00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:33.659
Caption: sit down and code with and again our

00:11:31.619 --> 00:11:35.219
Caption: same conversation of having my housemate

00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:37.379
Caption: who isn&#39;t actually in technology he&#39;s

00:11:35.219 --> 00:11:38.639
Caption: like oh it&#39;s coming to like from why

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.380
Caption: you&#39;re describing it it&#39;s kind of like

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.299
Caption: you sitting there

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.700
Caption: writing code and it&#39;s like having a

00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:46.440
Caption: senior developer working next year and I

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.958
Caption: was like well yeah but it&#39;s like having

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.458
Caption: like 83 million developers senior

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.898
Caption: developers working next to you not that

00:11:50.458 --> 00:11:54.239
Caption: everyone using GitHub as a scene in

00:11:51.898 --> 00:11:57.119
Caption: developer but you&#39;re basically using the

00:11:54.239 --> 00:12:00.000
Caption: collective knowledge of the internet

00:11:57.119 --> 00:12:01.440
Caption: to then help you write code which I

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.419
Caption: think is really cool I mean that&#39;s one

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.299
Caption: of the coolest things about us being

00:12:03.419 --> 00:12:08.338
Caption: able to sit down and um you know where

00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:09.778
Caption: we&#39;ve come now in history right we&#39;re

00:12:08.338 --> 00:12:11.458
Caption: able to use the collective knowledge of

00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:12.778
Caption: everyone else who came before us so why

00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:15.140
Caption: can&#39;t we use that every single day while

00:12:12.778 --> 00:12:15.140
Caption: we code

00:12:15.239 --> 00:12:18.898
Caption: and one of the things I really like

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:22.619
Caption: about the co-pilot too is it&#39;s not

00:12:18.898 --> 00:12:24.539
Caption: really limited to any particular person

00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:26.338
Caption: right you know Damon did a fantastic

00:12:24.539 --> 00:12:28.199
Caption: talk before I&#39;m like code spaces and

00:12:26.338 --> 00:12:30.000
Caption: actions and all this kind of cool stuff

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.260
Caption: like yeah that&#39;s so cool you know but

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.059
Caption: some of it when you start getting it

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.440
Caption: deep I&#39;m like oh it&#39;s kind of beyond my

00:12:33.059 --> 00:12:37.078
Caption: knowledge

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.299
Caption: but we Corey pilot pretty much every

00:12:37.078 --> 00:12:41.639
Caption: single person can use it whether you&#39;re

00:12:39.299 --> 00:12:43.500
Caption: a developer that&#39;s just starting out or

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.898
Caption: you&#39;re a senior developer working on

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:49.619
Caption: Facebook or Instagram or whatever you&#39;re

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:51.659
Caption: doing that&#39;s what I really like about it

00:12:49.619 --> 00:12:53.518
Caption: so here&#39;s a little snippet from our

00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:56.338
Caption: website so you can see it works in

00:12:53.518 --> 00:12:58.320
Caption: multiple languages well

00:12:56.338 --> 00:13:00.299
Caption: so we have lots of different languages

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.100
Caption: you can use copilot with

00:13:00.299 --> 00:13:04.380
Caption: and you can see a little bit in a demo

00:13:02.099 --> 00:13:06.419
Caption: about the different types of ways you

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.398
Caption: can use those languages

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:10.979
Caption: and what I really like about too is it

00:13:08.398 --> 00:13:13.380
Caption: doesn&#39;t just provide you with code that

00:13:10.979 --> 00:13:15.599
Caption: it thinks you need it provides you with

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.619
Caption: really really meaningful code based on

00:13:15.599 --> 00:13:18.619
Caption: the context that you&#39;ve got

00:13:18.719 --> 00:13:21.778
Caption: all right let&#39;s get into a demo there&#39;s

00:13:20.518 --> 00:13:23.099
Caption: a couple of spoilers in there so I was

00:13:21.778 --> 00:13:25.619
Caption: like well let&#39;s not talk about those now

00:13:23.099 --> 00:13:28.440
Caption: let&#39;s talk about the demo right so in

00:13:25.619 --> 00:13:30.179
Caption: this demo this is pre-recorded but it&#39;s

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.159
Caption: mine I did this myself like literally

00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:33.958
Caption: two days ago one of the reasons I did it

00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:35.219
Caption: pre-recorded is we don&#39;t have a lot of

00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.859
Caption: time we literally have like 20 minutes

00:13:35.219 --> 00:13:39.299
Caption: uh the second reason is because copilot

00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:41.578
Caption: learns

00:13:39.299 --> 00:13:42.838
Caption: it means that when I finish writing the

00:13:41.578 --> 00:13:44.760
Caption: code already knows I&#39;m going to write

00:13:42.838 --> 00:13:47.099
Caption: what I want so I&#39;m going to show you in

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.559
Caption: a minute but basically if you haven&#39;t

00:13:47.099 --> 00:13:53.159
Caption: used GitHub profile before you need to

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:56.338
Caption: go to the vs code extension Marketplace

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:57.479
Caption: you&#39;re going to grab Copilot reinstall

00:13:56.338 --> 00:13:59.820
Caption: it

00:13:57.479 --> 00:14:01.979
Caption: you log into GitHub

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.320
Caption: like use your credentials to log in

00:14:01.979 --> 00:14:06.119
Caption: and then you allow it and then you can

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.500
Caption: start using Copilot

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:09.898
Caption: so you can see down the bottom there

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.518
Caption: that little co-pilot icon there

00:14:09.898 --> 00:14:12.539
Caption: so when we&#39;re using it this is an

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:14.159
Caption: example

00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:17.338
Caption: um that I wrote the other day

00:14:14.159 --> 00:14:18.958
Caption: I was on twilio Quest trying to do one

00:14:17.338 --> 00:14:20.940
Caption: of their coding challenges and I got a

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:23.159
Caption: little bit stuck and I was like hahaha I

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.679
Caption: can use co-pilot and I was doing this

00:14:23.159 --> 00:14:27.898
Caption: live on a twitch stream as well so what

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:30.778
Caption: I&#39;m providing up there is um basically

00:14:27.898 --> 00:14:33.659
Caption: the um the problem that it was asking me

00:14:30.778 --> 00:14:35.760
Caption: to solve and interestingly enough even

00:14:33.659 --> 00:14:37.979
Caption: though I wrote that out as a comment to

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.359
Caption: start off with it tried to give me a

00:14:37.979 --> 00:14:41.219
Caption: function so what

00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:43.440
Caption: the um the problem there is basically it

00:14:41.219 --> 00:14:45.299
Caption: reverse the sentence all the letters

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.979
Caption: need to be non-capitalized unless it&#39;s

00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:48.599
Caption: the name of something the first letter

00:14:46.979 --> 00:14:49.799
Caption: of the word of the reverse sentence

00:14:48.599 --> 00:14:51.659
Caption: needs to be capitalized and the

00:14:49.799 --> 00:14:52.919
Caption: punctuation needs to go at the end so

00:14:51.659 --> 00:14:54.119
Caption: obviously when I wrote oh we need to

00:14:52.919 --> 00:14:55.739
Caption: reverse the sentence it just gave me one

00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:57.659
Caption: function it says reverse a sentence I

00:14:55.739 --> 00:14:58.500
Caption: was like okay copilot needs more context

00:14:57.659 --> 00:15:00.719
Caption: here

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.039
Caption: so what I&#39;m writing out and this is what

00:15:00.719 --> 00:15:03.958
Caption: I did on my stream I was like all right

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:05.820
Caption: what are the steps that I need to go

00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:07.320
Caption: through to solve this problem let&#39;s

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.359
Caption: write them out and plain English each

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.160
Caption: step that I need to do so I&#39;m here I&#39;m

00:15:09.359 --> 00:15:12.838
Caption: going okay first let&#39;s actually make the

00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:14.338
Caption: first letter of the sentence lower case

00:15:12.838 --> 00:15:16.320
Caption: if it&#39;s not an I I had a bunch of

00:15:14.338 --> 00:15:18.719
Caption: sentences and I was like let&#39;s not not

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.760
Caption: worry about like names of places let&#39;s

00:15:18.719 --> 00:15:22.679
Caption: just start a little bit basic with an

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.179
Caption: iron so I was like okay

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:25.799
Caption: um okay Copart let&#39;s see what you can

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:27.299
Caption: give me and I was like all right let&#39;s

00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:28.138
Caption: um change a couple little parameters

00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:29.880
Caption: here

00:15:28.138 --> 00:15:31.078
Caption: just to make it a little bit easier to

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.518
Caption: understand

00:15:31.078 --> 00:15:35.458
Caption: but

00:15:32.518 --> 00:15:37.619
Caption: by providing co-pilot with the context

00:15:35.458 --> 00:15:40.078
Caption: and the way that I want to solve this

00:15:37.619 --> 00:15:41.760
Caption: problem it&#39;s able to help me better than

00:15:40.078 --> 00:15:43.679
Caption: the original

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.000
Caption: um snippet of code that it gave me which

00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:46.260
Caption: is reverse a sentence I&#39;m like well

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.778
Caption: that&#39;s great if I just want to reverse

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.639
Caption: the sentence but I knew how to do that

00:15:48.778 --> 00:15:51.958
Caption: um so let&#39;s go through these on so I was

00:15:50.638 --> 00:15:54.000
Caption: like right next we want to split the

00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.260
Caption: sentence into an array of words because

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.760
Caption: we actually want to reverse this

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.380
Caption: sentence

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.239
Caption: so it&#39;s like all right that&#39;s there and

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.398
Caption: I&#39;m like oh sweet that&#39;s pretty good too

00:16:00.239 --> 00:16:03.838
Caption: and I&#39;m sitting there going tab tab tab

00:16:02.398 --> 00:16:06.000
Caption: while I&#39;m live streaming this thing

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:08.099
Caption: which is pretty cool I was like I don&#39;t

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.539
Caption: have to do anything here yeah Copart

00:16:08.099 --> 00:16:11.159
Caption: really is going to take my job uh

00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:12.659
Caption: provides with all the punctuation marks

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:15.179
Caption: there but I was like oh no I want to

00:16:12.659 --> 00:16:16.319
Caption: make sure that um this the words yeah

00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:19.500
Caption: there you go

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.820
Caption: pretty pretty cool hey

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.320
Caption: um so yeah I was like all right now

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.000
Caption: let&#39;s take out the punctuation marks

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.739
Caption: from the sentence and what I want to do

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.539
Caption: is I want to store them still so I could

00:16:25.739 --> 00:16:29.398
Caption: add them back in later which is why I&#39;m

00:16:27.539 --> 00:16:31.559
Caption: um adding the array there I was like

00:16:29.398 --> 00:16:33.838
Caption: right now I&#39;m going to remove them so

00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:35.698
Caption: right there it is let&#39;s uh replace the

00:16:33.838 --> 00:16:37.859
Caption: punctuation marks there with um with

00:16:35.698 --> 00:16:39.359
Caption: nothing at the end

00:16:37.859 --> 00:16:40.440
Caption: um so I was like oh I&#39;m going to call it

00:16:39.359 --> 00:16:42.898
Caption: a sentence because that&#39;s going to be

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.698
Caption: easy and then obviously last thing we

00:16:42.898 --> 00:16:45.359
Caption: want to do is we want to

00:16:44.698 --> 00:16:47.458
Caption: um

00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:49.679
Caption: uh split no obviously we&#39;ve done this

00:16:47.458 --> 00:16:51.838
Caption: now let&#39;s split the center reverse the

00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:53.338
Caption: sentence here come on gee I&#39;m typing

00:16:51.838 --> 00:16:55.619
Caption: really slow on it

00:16:53.338 --> 00:16:57.179
Caption: um let&#39;s reverse the sentence join it

00:16:55.619 --> 00:16:58.739
Caption: back together again and add the

00:16:57.179 --> 00:16:59.698
Caption: punctuation marks at the end I was like

00:16:58.739 --> 00:17:01.500
Caption: sweet

00:16:59.698 --> 00:17:04.318
Caption: um what are you gonna give me okay

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.838
Caption: that&#39;s a pretty good copilot

00:17:04.318 --> 00:17:08.219
Caption: um so let&#39;s let&#39;s name that there and I

00:17:06.838 --> 00:17:12.359
Caption: was like sweet

00:17:08.219 --> 00:17:14.400
Caption: I basically have most of my stuff there

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:16.260
Caption: thanks to copilot

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.020
Caption: um changed a couple little parameters as

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:20.160
Caption: you can see I had a help from a

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.119
Caption: developer who&#39;s a lot more senior than

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.520
Caption: me

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:25.260
Caption: um doing this on stream but yeah this

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.119
Caption: was like really cool that copilot&#39;s able

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.619
Caption: to do this now I was like finally yeah

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:30.418
Caption: we need to add the punctuation marks

00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:32.040
Caption: back into the sentence and we need to

00:17:30.418 --> 00:17:34.139
Caption: actually join it back together so you

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.479
Caption: can see here it&#39;s trying to predict what

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.039
Caption: I&#39;m asked like what it wants to do but

00:17:36.479 --> 00:17:39.599
Caption: I&#39;m like providing with a little bit

00:17:38.038 --> 00:17:40.500
Caption: more context each time we can see their

00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:42.959
Caption: Bang

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:46.199
Caption: it&#39;s provided that with me and I was

00:17:42.959 --> 00:17:48.000
Caption: like that&#39;s really cool again let&#39;s

00:17:46.199 --> 00:17:49.380
Caption: double check that with um some code that

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.739
Caption: a senior developer gave me and I was

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.539
Caption: like well that&#39;s exactly what he wrote

00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:55.918
Caption: basically I think copilot&#39;s come for

00:17:54.538 --> 00:17:57.659
Caption: your job mate

00:17:55.918 --> 00:17:59.519
Caption: um no I&#39;m just kidding but basically

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.320
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s really awesome it&#39;s able to

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.760
Caption: provide with a lot of context and I&#39;ll

00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:04.798
Caption: give you a couple of quotes here these

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.298
Caption: are straight off our website

00:18:04.798 --> 00:18:08.159
Caption: um but yeah like people are just

00:18:06.298 --> 00:18:11.519
Caption: absolutely loving

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.840
Caption: um what co-pilot does so it is pretty

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.179
Caption: awesome and it&#39;s like actually

00:18:12.839 --> 00:18:16.918
Caption: mind-blowing um the technology it does

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:18.839
Caption: now as I was saying before one of the

00:18:16.918 --> 00:18:22.319
Caption: reasons why I didn&#39;t want to do this

00:18:18.839 --> 00:18:24.719
Caption: live is because when you are writing

00:18:22.319 --> 00:18:26.479
Caption: co-pilot and you can see there we went

00:18:24.719 --> 00:18:28.558
Caption: through all the stuff

00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:31.500
Caption: copart&#39;s learning

00:18:28.558 --> 00:18:33.538
Caption: it&#39;s learning what you want it to do and

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.760
Caption: for you so I was like okay what happens

00:18:33.538 --> 00:18:36.959
Caption: if I had have done this live something

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.239
Caption: like this probably would have happened

00:18:36.959 --> 00:18:40.678
Caption: so open up a brand new file copy and

00:18:39.239 --> 00:18:42.359
Caption: paste that same bit in there and Copart

00:18:40.678 --> 00:18:43.739
Caption: goes oh yeah I think I know what you&#39;re

00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:45.178
Caption: trying to do

00:18:43.739 --> 00:18:47.038
Caption: um I reckon you&#39;re trying to reverse a

00:18:45.178 --> 00:18:49.319
Caption: sentence and bang

00:18:47.038 --> 00:18:50.519
Caption: the whole thing I was like that&#39;s what

00:18:49.319 --> 00:18:52.558
Caption: would have happened if we had done this

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.440
Caption: live and you wouldn&#39;t have got that cool

00:18:52.558 --> 00:18:58.319
Caption: like that you know the suspense of each

00:18:55.439 --> 00:18:59.819
Caption: part you know breaking down the uh the

00:18:58.319 --> 00:19:02.159
Caption: problem and understanding how to

00:18:59.819 --> 00:19:04.079
Caption: actually do that so thanks to that one

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.780
Caption: co-file that was really cool

00:19:04.079 --> 00:19:08.279
Caption: now people really like this and again my

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.679
Caption: the title my talk isn&#39;t just using

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.299
Caption: copilot to code it&#39;s using copilot to

00:19:10.678 --> 00:19:14.819
Caption: actually understand

00:19:12.298 --> 00:19:16.019
Caption: um and learn with your code not just It

00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:17.639
Caption: Loan right

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.320
Caption: so I will launched just new things

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.539
Caption: shortly after copilot called GitHub

00:19:19.319 --> 00:19:23.819
Caption: co-pilot Labs you get another extension

00:19:21.538 --> 00:19:24.899
Caption: so you go to the vs Marketplace install

00:19:23.819 --> 00:19:26.819
Caption: that in there and then you&#39;ll see this

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.280
Caption: little pop-up on the side of your vs

00:19:26.819 --> 00:19:31.319
Caption: code called Copart Labs now what I like

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.179
Caption: about copilot Labs is it actually helps

00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:34.798
Caption: you again the same function here it

00:19:33.178 --> 00:19:36.538
Caption: actually helps you especially if you&#39;re

00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:38.038
Caption: starting and running

00:19:36.538 --> 00:19:40.319
Caption: I actually hope to explain and

00:19:38.038 --> 00:19:41.939
Caption: understand your code now again someone

00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:43.619
Caption: was you know you&#39;re kind of laughing at

00:19:41.939 --> 00:19:46.079
Caption: me before you wrote the code though

00:19:43.619 --> 00:19:47.459
Caption: don&#39;t you understand it not always what

00:19:46.079 --> 00:19:49.979
Caption: happens if I opened up this in a code

00:19:47.459 --> 00:19:51.899
Caption: space or forked forked um some code from

00:19:49.979 --> 00:19:53.640
Caption: someone else or claimed a repo what I

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.619
Caption: can do now is I can now highlight parts

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.479
Caption: of code and get co-pilot to actually

00:19:55.619 --> 00:20:00.418
Caption: explain what&#39;s going on here

00:19:57.479 --> 00:20:02.099
Caption: so co-pilot again if I click um if I

00:20:00.418 --> 00:20:04.019
Caption: keep clicking ask it&#39;ll try and explain

00:20:02.099 --> 00:20:05.099
Caption: it in a different way kind of like a

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.599
Caption: teacher it&#39;s like I didn&#39;t quite

00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:07.678
Caption: understand first time what we&#39;ll try

00:20:06.599 --> 00:20:08.760
Caption: again

00:20:07.678 --> 00:20:11.099
Caption: um and it gives you a bunch of different

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.619
Caption: options to actually explain your code so

00:20:11.099 --> 00:20:15.979
Caption: you can explain it in plain English yes

00:20:13.619 --> 00:20:18.418
Caption: this is a function design or you know to

00:20:15.979 --> 00:20:20.760
Caption: see if the first letter of the character

00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:22.798
Caption: in the sentence is actually an i if not

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.739
Caption: then it&#39;ll change it you can actually

00:20:22.798 --> 00:20:28.260
Caption: get it to explain it in um more in-depth

00:20:25.739 --> 00:20:30.058
Caption: English so like slightly longer and then

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.979
Caption: you can also get it to explain it to you

00:20:30.058 --> 00:20:33.959
Caption: in terms of like the syntax what parts

00:20:31.979 --> 00:20:35.579
Caption: of the function being called and then

00:20:33.959 --> 00:20:36.719
Caption: finally you can actually get it to give

00:20:35.579 --> 00:20:39.959
Caption: you

00:20:36.719 --> 00:20:41.819
Caption: um an example what would actually happen

00:20:39.959 --> 00:20:43.558
Caption: talked about this last night dinner as

00:20:41.819 --> 00:20:45.538
Caption: well the idea of actually translating

00:20:43.558 --> 00:20:47.279
Caption: your code this is still something we&#39;re

00:20:45.538 --> 00:20:48.659
Caption: working on so it&#39;s not perfect but you

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.340
Caption: can actually translate your code into

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.960
Caption: other languages so if you&#39;re a python

00:20:50.339 --> 00:20:54.599
Caption: developer and just wanting to learn

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:57.599
Caption: something else like it&#39;s a ruby PHP

00:20:54.599 --> 00:20:58.859
Caption: whatever you can now get it to try and

00:20:57.599 --> 00:21:00.418
Caption: help you translate your code now

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:01.380
Caption: obviously it&#39;s not perfect and see a

00:21:00.418 --> 00:21:03.298
Caption: couple of you sneaking there in the

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.280
Caption: corner uh it&#39;s not perfect it&#39;s not um

00:21:03.298 --> 00:21:07.380
Caption: it&#39;s not great we&#39;re getting there

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.080
Caption: um but yeah have a look at that

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:12.479
Caption: um so somebody asked me the other day

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:16.199
Caption: I&#39;m nearly wrapping up but what happens

00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:18.538
Caption: if I actually don&#39;t want co-pilot to use

00:21:16.199 --> 00:21:20.699
Caption: the stuff that I&#39;ve got to learn

00:21:18.538 --> 00:21:23.759
Caption: um what if also it does it because

00:21:20.699 --> 00:21:25.380
Caption: copied ever actually give us the same

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.239
Caption: um piece of code

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.039
Caption: because it&#39;s still a relatively new

00:21:27.239 --> 00:21:31.439
Caption: model and you know what we&#39;re still

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:35.459
Caption: doing we&#39;re still learning

00:21:31.439 --> 00:21:37.079
Caption: you can actually get co-pilot to filter

00:21:35.459 --> 00:21:39.839
Caption: out some of the things that it can tell

00:21:37.079 --> 00:21:42.298
Caption: you so in most cases the code that

00:21:39.839 --> 00:21:45.119
Caption: Copart gives you is specific to you it&#39;s

00:21:42.298 --> 00:21:46.619
Caption: been synthesized just for you in less

00:21:45.119 --> 00:21:48.538
Caption: than one percent of the cases however

00:21:46.619 --> 00:21:49.979
Caption: you might get code that is similar to

00:21:48.538 --> 00:21:52.259
Caption: something that is already in an open

00:21:49.979 --> 00:21:54.239
Caption: source repository so you can turn off

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.760
Caption: the filter in your copilot settings on

00:21:54.239 --> 00:21:58.798
Caption: GitHub and say actually block these

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.140
Caption: suggestions so if there&#39;s a snippet of

00:21:58.798 --> 00:22:02.639
Caption: code that&#39;s even you know 100 characters

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.739
Caption: I can&#39;t remember exactly what it is but

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.880
Caption: about 100 characters similar to another

00:22:04.739 --> 00:22:08.280
Caption: piece of code that&#39;s on the internet

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.678
Caption: don&#39;t show it to me and then under that

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:13.380
Caption: you also saw there was that um option to

00:22:10.678 --> 00:22:15.239
Caption: say do not use my code

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.159
Caption: um for improving github&#39;s products so

00:22:15.239 --> 00:22:19.140
Caption: your code won&#39;t be yours if you like

00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:20.960
Caption: profile head over to the copilot website

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.520
Caption: copilot.com

00:22:20.959 --> 00:22:26.298
Caption: and try it out

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.820
Caption: it is free for 60 days for anyone to try

00:22:26.298 --> 00:22:32.219
Caption: otherwise Ingress is 120 dollars

00:22:29.819 --> 00:22:35.279
Caption: for the year something like that

00:22:32.219 --> 00:22:36.839
Caption: ten dollars a month and then and a

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.640
Caption: hundred for a year so you get you know

00:22:36.839 --> 00:22:40.739
Caption: two months free if you sign up for the

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:42.419
Caption: whole year teachers I&#39;ve just found out

00:22:40.739 --> 00:22:44.339
Caption: if you&#39;re a teacher you now get Copart

00:22:42.418 --> 00:22:46.199
Caption: for free as part of the um campus

00:22:44.339 --> 00:22:48.900
Caption: program the GitHub Global Campus program

00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:51.178
Caption: it&#39;s a teacher you get it for free

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.099
Caption: and obviously open source developers um

00:22:51.178 --> 00:22:55.079
Caption: you get that um for free as well working

00:22:53.099 --> 00:22:57.119
Caption: on a big open source project now finally

00:22:55.079 --> 00:22:58.260
Caption: I know where um at time but finally I

00:22:57.119 --> 00:23:00.000
Caption: really want to touch on this point of

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.140
Caption: ownership because it comes up all the

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.880
Caption: time

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.260
Caption: um regardless of whether it&#39;s the

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.000
Caption: articles that we&#39;re talking about before

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.380
Caption: the artwork

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.659
Caption: um here with program people like what

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.298
Caption: happens with you know AI like ownership

00:23:09.659 --> 00:23:14.159
Caption: who owns the thing do I own it because I

00:23:12.298 --> 00:23:15.658
Caption: you know built the artwork does the

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:17.820
Caption: program own it because they&#39;re the ones

00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:20.100
Caption: who built the AI there&#39;s the open AI own

00:23:17.819 --> 00:23:21.839
Caption: it most of the time we&#39;ve come to the

00:23:20.099 --> 00:23:23.640
Caption: conclusion that nearly all these things

00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:26.400
Caption: they they allow the people who actually

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:29.280
Caption: create it to have the ownership and it&#39;s

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.500
Caption: exactly the same with co-pilot so the

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:34.200
Caption: code that you write with copilot is your

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.959
Caption: code nobody else owns it we don&#39;t own it

00:23:34.199 --> 00:23:38.939
Caption: you own it so I want to finish on that

00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:40.619
Caption: finally again there&#39;s a gist up there

00:23:38.939 --> 00:23:42.058
Caption: for all the resources links to

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:44.880
Caption: everything

00:23:42.058 --> 00:23:46.020
Caption: um that I spoke about if you do have

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.280
Caption: questions because obviously you don&#39;t

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:49.140
Caption: have time for questions and I never

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.760
Caption: included time for questions you can

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.159
Caption: tweet me on all the social media

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.539
Caption: platforms notes man or come chat to us

00:23:53.159 --> 00:23:56.460
Caption: at the booth because I have a couple

00:23:54.538 --> 00:23:58.079
Caption: persons ask your way thank you so much

00:23:56.459 --> 00:24:00.380
Caption: for listening to me co-pilot in 20

00:23:58.079 --> 00:24:00.380
Caption: minutes
