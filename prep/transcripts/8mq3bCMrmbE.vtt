00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
Caption: well it boasted lower fees and faster

00:00:02.638 --> 00:00:06.239
Caption: transactional times

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.319
Caption: and the interesting thing about ethereum

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:10.718
Caption: is it could track blocks of data not

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:12.239
Caption: just the ethereum coin

00:00:10.718 --> 00:00:14.638
Caption: and these blocks of data can be used to

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.479
Caption: store programs often

00:00:14.638 --> 00:00:18.719
Caption: you know little bits of code whatever

00:00:16.479 --> 00:00:20.319
Caption: whatever you can think of and vitalik

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:22.079
Caption: had a vision you know he envisioned a

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:24.799
Caption: future where the whole internet was

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.840
Caption: rewritten where it was all decentralized

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:29.840
Caption: bypassing governments and banks and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.399
Caption: other centralized services you know your

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.200
Caption: very identity could be stored on the

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:37.359
Caption: chain um a term that comes up a lot and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.319
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk about it is banking

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.399
Caption: the unbanked and the forgotten

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:43.919
Caption: which personally i&#39;m not too sure what

00:00:42.398 --> 00:00:46.799
Caption: that actually means but we&#39;ll talk about

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:48.718
Caption: it okay so i&#39;ve shared this quote from

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.078
Caption: it&#39;s doing that sorry i do apologize

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.520
Caption: it&#39;s doing that thing where it&#39;s like

00:00:50.078 --> 00:00:53.439
Caption: skipping

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.440
Caption: slides

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:57.439
Caption: okay so i&#39;ve shared this quote from

00:00:55.439 --> 00:01:00.078
Caption: vitalik so i&#39;ll read it to you i cried

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:02.558
Caption: myself to sleep and on that day i

00:01:00.078 --> 00:01:04.959
Caption: realized what horrors centralized

00:01:02.558 --> 00:01:06.879
Caption: services can bring now that sounds

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.720
Caption: pretty drastic right so you&#39;d think he&#39;d

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:10.239
Caption: be talking about something

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.040
Caption: absolutely

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:14.798
Caption: devastating but it turns out he&#39;s

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.959
Caption: talking about world of warcraft so he

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.040
Caption: used to play world of warcraft

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:21.040
Caption: and he logs on one day to find that his

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.279
Caption: favorite mage wizard character&#39;s

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.279
Caption: favorite spell has been nerfed by the

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:26.720
Caption: dev team because the dev team thought it

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:28.559
Caption: was too effective

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.159
Caption: and that was his reaction and i haven&#39;t

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:32.478
Caption: posted this to make fun of him like

00:01:30.158 --> 00:01:33.919
Caption: we&#39;ve all got way attached to something

00:01:32.478 --> 00:01:36.078
Caption: in our lives i&#39;ve definitely got

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:38.078
Caption: attached to video games in the past

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.759
Caption: but it&#39;s just i think it&#39;s worth sharing

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.799
Caption: because it&#39;s interesting looking at the

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.159
Caption: sort of thought process that&#39;s happening

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.119
Caption: inside the head of a lot of the people

00:01:44.158 --> 00:01:50.559
Caption: working in the web 3 space

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.560
Caption: okay so nfts i&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ve all

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:55.758
Caption: seen nfts over the last few years they

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:58.078
Caption: really exploded during covid

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.840
Caption: or non-fungible tokens is their full

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.000
Caption: name it&#39;s a way of proving that

00:01:59.839 --> 00:02:04.798
Caption: something is unique from a technical

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.919
Caption: perspective they&#39;re just a serial number

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.160
Caption: that can&#39;t be split into smaller parts

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.360
Caption: right so you know if you have two nfts

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.440
Caption: of the same thing they&#39;re gonna have

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.119
Caption: different serial numbers so if you took

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.279
Caption: a picture of me right now waving my arms

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.639
Caption: and we turn that into an nft the first

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.919
Caption: one would have one serial number the

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.238
Caption: second one would have another serial

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.440
Caption: number and it&#39;s a bit like prince of a

00:02:22.238 --> 00:02:25.759
Caption: painting so you know when you have a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.279
Caption: painting you make prints the first one

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.878
Caption: is worth the most the second one a

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.080
Caption: little bit less and third and so on and

00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:30.958
Caption: so forth

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.319
Caption: now

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.919
Caption: nfts

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.598
Caption: often referred to as tokens that

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:38.238
Caption: digitalize something

00:02:35.598 --> 00:02:40.399
Caption: can also store small packets of data or

00:02:38.238 --> 00:02:42.958
Caption: code and these are often referred to as

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:45.199
Caption: smart contracts now nfts are supposed to

00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:46.958
Caption: be a revolution where they could

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:49.598
Caption: liberate artists from the gig economy

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:51.679
Caption: they could be used for identity tickets

00:02:49.598 --> 00:02:53.360
Caption: ownership and more

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.958
Caption: and i&#39;m just going to once again just

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.039
Caption: step out of our little timeline here to

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:59.919
Caption: talk about another tweet from someone in

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:02.399
Caption: the nft space which i just

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:04.639
Caption: find a little confusing so nfts equal

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:06.799
Caption: identity 2.0

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.319
Caption: can&#39;t remember the last time i used my

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.639
Caption: picture on the left

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.440
Caption: and i&#39;ll read these out to you emphasis

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:15.759
Caption: on physical traits genetic lottery prone

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.279
Caption: to bias and prejudice and then under his

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:22.158
Caption: nft identity by choice unique and

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:24.319
Caption: digitally scarce representation of

00:03:22.158 --> 00:03:26.720
Caption: values and beliefs now i&#39;m going to put

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.158
Caption: aside the fact that the nft

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.720
Caption: looks like something that we used to

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:33.279
Caption: make in ms payne at high school

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.040
Caption: and the thing is santiago has a vested

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:37.598
Caption: interest in you believing this is the

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:39.279
Caption: case because he paid the equivalent of

00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:41.919
Caption: 171

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:43.119
Caption: 000 u.s dollars for that nft

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.958
Caption: on the right

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.878
Caption: so quite interesting

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.639
Caption: okay so last technical term and then

00:03:46.878 --> 00:03:52.878
Caption: we&#39;re going to delve into the

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:54.639
Caption: um the juicy bits um so web3 so web one

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:56.878
Caption: is like static content you know the web

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.559
Caption: in the early days where you would read

00:03:56.878 --> 00:04:01.119
Caption: stuff you know on the internet you

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:03.518
Caption: didn&#39;t interact with it web 2 is users

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:05.919
Caption: creating content so like youtube social

00:04:03.518 --> 00:04:08.479
Caption: media we make videos we make posts you

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.798
Caption: know it&#39;s a much more service orientated

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:13.360
Caption: internet web 3 is supposed to be this

00:04:10.798 --> 00:04:15.759
Caption: new revolution in the crypto space where

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.239
Caption: users control their data and content

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:20.798
Caption: things are more distributed and it&#39;s not

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.400
Caption: controlled by big corporations now the

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.160
Caption: thing is i actually agree with some of

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:25.919
Caption: that you know terminology being used

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.239
Caption: there i do believe we should all control

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.000
Caption: our own data and i also believe that

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:31.918
Caption: having all the power in a few tech

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.600
Caption: companies is a bad idea

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.800
Caption: but i really disagree with the execution

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.679
Caption: okay so

00:04:36.799 --> 00:04:41.599
Caption: time to spread some fud what&#39;s fud alex

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:42.639
Caption: um so in the crypto space when you

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.040
Caption: spread

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.440
Caption: negative thoughts or sentiment or point

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.919
Caption: out critical issues in a project you

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.080
Caption: often get accused of spreading fud you

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.000
Caption: know you&#39;re preventing us all going to

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:56.319
Caption: the moon and buying lambos or whatever

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.399
Caption: they say so let&#39;s spread some fun

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.320
Caption: okay let&#39;s talk about ransomware really

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:05.519
Caption: quickly ransomware is a terrible thing

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.639
Caption: right we are seeing schools hospitals

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:10.959
Caption: energy supply pipelines being held to

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.720
Caption: ransom by cyber criminals and most of

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:14.160
Caption: the time they have to pay in bitcoin to

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.399
Caption: get their data back once it&#39;s been

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.199
Caption: stolen and encrypted we even have

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:20.959
Caption: individuals i mean i&#39;m sure there&#39;s some

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.520
Caption: of you in this room with grandparents

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:25.440
Caption: that have had their data stolen and been

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:26.559
Caption: you know held at ransom it happens all

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.000
Caption: the time

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:32.239
Caption: and this is a 5.2 billion dollar a year

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.639
Caption: industry that is insane in fact that

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:36.000
Caption: number has probably gone up since i made

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.080
Caption: this slide

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.799
Caption: and it&#39;s worth pointing out that this

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:43.279
Caption: industry is only as big as it is

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:45.679
Caption: because of things like bitcoin

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:47.600
Caption: because the thing is if you get held to

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.759
Caption: ransom with your data

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.839
Caption: and they say transfer twenty thousand

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:54.399
Caption: dollars to us please if you go down to

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:56.479
Caption: your bank to do that online or in person

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:58.239
Caption: they&#39;re going to have questions about

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.399
Caption: transferring twenty thousand dollars

00:05:58.239 --> 00:06:02.000
Caption: they&#39;re not going to just let you do it

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:04.239
Caption: and the thing is if they know that the

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.639
Caption: receiver is a known criminal or on their

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:08.638
Caption: sanctions list they&#39;re also not going to

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.639
Caption: do it the thing is by creating things

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.559
Caption: like bitcoin we&#39;ve actually created

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.800
Caption: loopholes around our centralized

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:17.039
Caption: services allowing industries like this

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:18.879
Caption: to flourish now look i&#39;m not going to be

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.880
Caption: the first one to defend banks they have

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.360
Caption: screwed us over a lot you know just look

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.919
Caption: at 2008 for example but the thing is

00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:28.159
Caption: centralized services exists for a reason

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.160
Caption: you know security sanctions and laws

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.800
Caption: need to be paid attention to and look

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.959
Caption: they&#39;re not always perfect but the thing

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:37.440
Caption: is we do have democratic governments so

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:39.519
Caption: we can try and get people elected that

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.759
Caption: make it better rather than creating

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:44.239
Caption: loopholes that create industries as

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.759
Caption: predatory as this

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:47.839
Caption: so let&#39;s talk about energy and

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.839
Caption: environment possibly my favorite topic

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:52.319
Caption: because i work in the climate space now

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:53.600
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk about bitcoin first

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:55.839
Caption: and for those of you who work in the

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.839
Caption: space don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll get to

00:06:55.839 --> 00:07:00.079
Caption: environmentally friendly crypto coins as

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:03.119
Caption: well but we need to talk about bitcoin

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:06.239
Caption: because it is the biggest and the worst

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:09.199
Caption: right so bitcoin uses 0.5 percent of the

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:11.759
Caption: world&#39;s power just for bitcoin that is a

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:14.479
Caption: tremendous amount of energy it uses more

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.239
Caption: energy annually than argentina

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:18.479
Caption: and then the second factor that i think

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:20.880
Caption: is really really important it produces

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:24.000
Caption: more e-waste than the netherlands

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.520
Caption: right so bitcoin is responsible for

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.399
Caption: uh supply shortages in chips ssds and

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:31.839
Caption: more right so when the ps5 came out and

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:34.079
Caption: you couldn&#39;t get one i mean obviously

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:36.959
Caption: covet played a part but it was also due

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:40.079
Caption: to bitcoin miners using all these chips

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:41.519
Caption: that&#39;s why people couldn&#39;t get a ps5 and

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:42.879
Caption: you know personally i don&#39;t want to live

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:46.559

Caption: playstation 5 when you want one

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:50.000
Caption: and there&#39;s something else to be said

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:51.839
Caption: now i&#39;m not going to debate this climate

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.119
Caption: change is real if you don&#39;t believe this

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:54.959
Caption: then you can ignore this part of the

00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:57.119
Caption: talk but we have to transition to

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:58.479
Caption: renewable energy in australia i mean in

00:07:57.119 --> 00:08:00.559
Caption: other countries they may have to use

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:02.479
Caption: nuclear but in other parts of the world

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:05.199
Caption: we&#39;ve all got to transition right we

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:07.199
Caption: have to do it and there is only so much

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:08.720
Caption: energy in the world and one of my

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:11.039
Caption: arguments here is you really can&#39;t

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:13.598
Caption: afford to waste energy on a speculative

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:15.919
Caption: system like bitcoin when we have to

00:08:13.598 --> 00:08:17.839
Caption: transition to save our future

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:20.240
Caption: and it&#39;s also worth noting that only a

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:22.079
Caption: few days ago just as i was doing another

00:08:20.239 --> 00:08:23.279
Caption: practice the white house tweeted that

00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:24.878
Caption: they are actually looking at

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:26.799
Caption: proof-of-work blockchains and

00:08:24.878 --> 00:08:28.319
Caption: considering banning them because they&#39;re

00:08:26.799 --> 00:08:30.799
Caption: going to prevent them from reaching

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:33.919
Caption: reaching their environmental targets

00:08:30.799 --> 00:08:36.880
Caption: and bitcoin is really bad so many

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:40.559
Caption: dormant or near dormant fossil fuel

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:42.880
Caption: fired power plants are restarted to mine

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:45.278

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.919
Caption: increased its emissions by six percent

00:08:45.278 --> 00:08:50.080
Caption: and heated up a local lake when they

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:52.239
Caption: started mining bitcoin and we&#39;re seeing

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.799
Caption: this all the time there&#39;s so much green

00:08:52.239 --> 00:08:56.559
Caption: washing going on we&#39;ve got fossil fuel

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:57.679

00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:00.000
Caption: bitcoin

00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:01.760
Caption: miners and attaching it to gas burn off

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.599
Caption: to power it we&#39;re making fossil fuel

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.600
Caption: companies more profitable

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:08.958
Caption: so you know inevitably people can be

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:10.958
Caption: like alex

00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.640
Caption: you keep talking about bitcoin which

00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:15.359
Caption: uses proof of work which remember is

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.200
Caption: that complicated algorithm process to

00:09:15.359 --> 00:09:20.880
Caption: add a block to a chain

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.958
Caption: now there are environmentally friendly

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.838
Caption: crypto cryptocurrencies as well and they

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.000
Caption: tend to use something called

00:09:23.838 --> 00:09:27.599
Caption: proof-of-stake so it&#39;s more efficient

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.760
Caption: because it doesn&#39;t scale in cost and

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:32.799
Caption: time like proof-of-work but it does make

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.799
Caption: participation expensive so basically

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:37.919
Caption: validation is

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:39.359
Caption: achieved by how much a user has to stake

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:41.518
Caption: so for example you need to hold a

00:09:39.359 --> 00:09:43.679
Caption: certain amount of the crypto or tokens

00:09:41.518 --> 00:09:45.919
Caption: to be able to add blocks to the chain

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:50.080
Caption: so that makes it really easy for someone

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:52.079
Caption: with a lot of money to own the entire

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.080
Caption: chain which begs the question is it

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.838
Caption: really decentralized then

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.640
Caption: um so it&#39;s not as secure as proof of

00:09:55.838 --> 00:10:00.640
Caption: work now ethereum currently uses proof

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.559
Caption: of work and is apparently going to be

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.958
Caption: switching to proof of stake for the last

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:06.398
Caption: seven years but they haven&#39;t however

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.838
Caption: they&#39;ve made a big announcement this

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:10.159
Caption: month that they&#39;re finally going to do

00:10:07.838 --> 00:10:12.398
Caption: it and it looks like they might actually

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:14.479
Caption: do it this time and that would make

00:10:12.398 --> 00:10:15.679
Caption: ethereum environmentally friendly

00:10:14.479 --> 00:10:18.880
Caption: however

00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:21.278
Caption: that&#39;s not where my beef ends

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.679
Caption: so let&#39;s talk about fraud and scams now

00:10:21.278 --> 00:10:27.119
Caption: one about to talk to you is all facts

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:27.119
Caption: and is a serious problem

00:10:27.479 --> 00:10:34.479

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.119
Caption: two weeks ago it has gone up

00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:43.278
Caption: since then so let&#39;s have a look at the

00:10:41.119 --> 00:10:45.679
Caption: scams that happen so rug pools these are

00:10:43.278 --> 00:10:48.398
Caption: really common so it&#39;s where a developer

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:50.719
Caption: uh or you know a company raises

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:53.278
Caption: tokens and then makes a run for the door

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:54.799
Caption: with investments right so a good way to

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:57.760
Caption: think about this you know a startup you

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:59.278
Caption: have an idea you build an mvp you raise

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.679
Caption: investment you build the product you

00:10:59.278 --> 00:11:03.518
Caption: grow the value of the company well in

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:06.398
Caption: the web 3 space what happens a lot of

00:11:03.518 --> 00:11:09.440
Caption: the time is that you know people have

00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:11.838
Caption: vague plans for a video game or a

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.599
Caption: product or something and then they raise

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:15.359
Caption: all these tokens

00:11:13.599 --> 00:11:16.958
Caption: and then they just cash out and

00:11:15.359 --> 00:11:18.640
Caption: disappear and they shut down all the

00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.479
Caption: social media sites they shut down the

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.760

Caption: happens a lot and i think it&#39;s really

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.479
Caption: worth addressing

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:15.359
Caption: so celsius network is like a bank

00:12:12.479 --> 00:12:17.278
Caption: savings account except the idea is you

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:19.599
Caption: put your crypto in it so if i have some

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:22.159
Caption: bitcoin or ethereum i can lend it to

00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:24.479
Caption: celsius in like their account and they

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:26.879
Caption: loan it out to other people and i earn

00:12:24.479 --> 00:12:29.039
Caption: interest on my crypto being with them

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.359
Caption: now it was touted as being safer than a

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:33.838
Caption: bank you know the new type of

00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:36.799

00:12:39.518 --> 00:12:43.039
Caption: filed for bankruptcy

00:12:41.359 --> 00:12:45.599

Caption: explain the losses that they&#39;ve suffered

00:12:50.638 --> 00:12:54.638

00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:32.320
Caption: margin interest

00:13:30.638 --> 00:13:34.000

00:14:49.119 --> 00:14:52.958

Caption: the celsius network

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:57.760
Caption: now as a single senior citizen i faced

00:14:55.599 --> 00:15:00.000

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.679
Caption: forced to sell my home return to work

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.838
Caption: and possibly rely on government relief

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:06.958
Caption: to make up for this deception

00:15:03.838 --> 00:15:08.958
Caption: now i know that some of you in this room

00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:12.078
Caption: will be thinking hey you should only

00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:13.838
Caption: invest what you can afford to lose

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:16.078
Caption: and i think it&#39;s really really important

00:15:13.838 --> 00:15:18.958
Caption: to hear to point out that is victim

00:15:16.078 --> 00:15:21.760
Caption: blaming celsius lied to these people

00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:24.880
Caption: they defrauded them they sold them false

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.040
Caption: promises they told them things were safe

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.559
Caption: and their money was in good hands they

00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:30.719
Caption: were lied to

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:32.078
Caption: so if this pops into your head please

00:15:30.719 --> 00:15:34.958
Caption: just throw it away because it&#39;s an

00:15:32.078 --> 00:15:36.880
Caption: invalid argument it is victim blaming

00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:39.119
Caption: and i think another thing to think about

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.198
Caption: here is we live in a society which isn&#39;t

00:15:39.119 --> 00:15:43.760
Caption: fair there are systems that when you end

00:15:41.198 --> 00:15:45.838
Caption: up in poverty keep you down and the

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.679
Caption: chances are most of you in this room

00:15:45.838 --> 00:15:50.159
Caption: might never have experienced poverty we

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:52.479
Caption: work in tech which gives us access to a

00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:54.799
Caption: relatively good lifestyle but the thing

00:15:52.479 --> 00:15:56.078
Caption: is when you&#39;re in poverty all you can do

00:15:54.799 --> 00:15:57.758
Caption: is think about how am i going to get out

00:15:56.078 --> 00:15:59.838
Caption: this where&#39;s my next meal going to come

00:15:57.758 --> 00:16:01.758
Caption: from and when someone comes along

00:15:59.838 --> 00:16:03.278
Caption: promising the world and saying to you

00:16:01.758 --> 00:16:04.879
Caption: i&#39;ve got the solution that&#39;s going to

00:16:03.278 --> 00:16:07.039
Caption: break you out of the system that&#39;s going

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.880
Caption: to stop you from being poor you&#39;re going

00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:10.559
Caption: to take that because you&#39;re looking for

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.720
Caption: that ray of hope

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:14.398
Caption: so i really hate this whole sentiment

00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:16.559
Caption: that you should only invest what you can

00:16:14.398 --> 00:16:19.838
Caption: afford to lose especially when the

00:16:16.559 --> 00:16:22.000
Caption: companies selling the future are lying

00:16:19.838 --> 00:16:24.559
Caption: so yeah look there&#39;s more scams inside

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.479
Caption: of trading uh so staff at coinbase have

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:28.719
Caption: been accused of buying tokens before

00:16:26.479 --> 00:16:29.758
Caption: they list so coinbase is a platform

00:16:28.719 --> 00:16:32.958
Caption: where you can buy and sell

00:16:29.758 --> 00:16:35.198
Caption: cryptocurrency uh ponzi schemes endless

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:38.000
Caption: projects returning profits from new

00:16:35.198 --> 00:16:39.599
Caption: investors to old investors wash trading

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.078
Caption: so that&#39;s kind of like where multiple

00:16:39.599 --> 00:16:44.638
Caption: accounts all by the same or multiple

00:16:42.078 --> 00:16:46.799
Caption: people sell nfts between them to inflate

00:16:44.638 --> 00:16:48.638
Caption: the price by the way all of this stuff

00:16:46.799 --> 00:16:50.880
Caption: that i&#39;ve just mentioned

00:16:48.638 --> 00:16:54.000
Caption: with normal security so like stocks and

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:56.720
Caption: bonds and companies it&#39;s against the law

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.278
Caption: if you do insider trading wash trading

00:16:56.719 --> 00:17:01.518
Caption: you go to jail there is a whole

00:16:59.278 --> 00:17:03.919
Caption: regulation industry set up to prevent it

00:17:01.518 --> 00:17:05.760
Caption: and look it doesn&#39;t always work but it&#39;s

00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:08.078
Caption: illegal and the thing is this industry

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.798
Caption: doesn&#39;t have any laws to protect it to

00:17:08.078 --> 00:17:13.198
Caption: protect normal everyday people now we

00:17:10.798 --> 00:17:15.678
Caption: are starting to see some punishments

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:17.280
Caption: in america and other places but so many

00:17:15.678 --> 00:17:19.198
Caption: people are still getting away with all

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.520
Caption: these terrible things we also have

00:17:19.198 --> 00:17:24.160
Caption: copyright issues artists who were

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.400
Caption: supposed to be liberated by nfts getting

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.479
Caption: angry when their work is stolen and

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.559
Caption: minted and sold as an nft without their

00:17:28.479 --> 00:17:32.798
Caption: permission and i think my favorite part

00:17:30.558 --> 00:17:35.038
Caption: about this is when they go to complain

00:17:32.798 --> 00:17:37.439
Caption: they get laughed at or chastised saying

00:17:35.038 --> 00:17:39.359
Caption: it&#39;s their fault for not doing it sooner

00:17:37.439 --> 00:17:41.678
Caption: and being part of the future

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:43.199
Caption: you know theft because in crypto you

00:17:41.678 --> 00:17:45.359
Caption: know we&#39;re not using banks you&#39;re

00:17:43.199 --> 00:17:48.399
Caption: supposed to be your own bank it&#39;s so

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:50.239
Caption: easy to scam and fraud people dropping

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.520
Caption: nfts into people&#39;s wallets that when

00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:55.839
Caption: they click it drains out all their money

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.919
Caption: now i could really go on about all these

00:17:55.839 --> 00:18:00.319
Caption: but one i&#39;ll be having a classic

00:17:57.918 --> 00:18:02.639
Caption: alexander rant and two it does get quite

00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:04.639
Caption: depressing but i think it&#39;s worth

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.039
Caption: mentioning here that crypto is zero sum

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.558
Caption: by design now what does that even mean

00:18:07.038 --> 00:18:10.239
Caption: um i have to admit when someone first

00:18:08.558 --> 00:18:11.760
Caption: explained it to me i was like what

00:18:10.239 --> 00:18:14.558
Caption: um but the best way to think about like

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.280
Caption: this when you buy a stock in a company

00:18:14.558 --> 00:18:19.279
Caption: the company generates value because it

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.799
Caption: sells a service or it develops a product

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.119
Caption: so more people become interested in it

00:18:20.798 --> 00:18:25.199
Caption: more people buy it so the value grows

00:18:23.119 --> 00:18:28.319
Caption: right so you get value because it&#39;s

00:18:25.199 --> 00:18:30.479
Caption: generated value in crypto that&#39;s not how

00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:32.639
Caption: it works right blockchain doesn&#39;t and

00:18:30.479 --> 00:18:35.439
Caption: bitcoin don&#39;t generate value not making

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:38.880
Caption: anything so your only chance to make

00:18:35.439 --> 00:18:41.279
Caption: money is to buy low sell high but

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.079
Caption: because it isn&#39;t generating value when

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.080
Caption: you sell at a high than when you brought

00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:48.640
Caption: you need someone else to put money in

00:18:46.079 --> 00:18:50.239
Caption: for you to get out which means it&#39;s zero

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.320
Caption: sum because for you to take money out

00:18:50.239 --> 00:18:54.880
Caption: someone has to put money in but when you

00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:57.119
Caption: take into consideration minors and

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.359
Caption: exchanges that extract money from the

00:18:57.119 --> 00:19:01.280
Caption: system it makes it strictly negative

00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:03.439
Caption: some which is really weird because we

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.840
Caption: now have this system where we&#39;ve got all

00:19:03.439 --> 00:19:07.839
Caption: these fraud and scams it&#39;s zero sum by

00:19:05.839 --> 00:19:10.239
Caption: design it almost sounds like a

00:19:07.839 --> 00:19:11.918
Caption: multi-level marketing scheme and this

00:19:10.239 --> 00:19:14.079
Caption: kind of gets backed up by these

00:19:11.918 --> 00:19:16.079
Caption: wonderful celebrities here

00:19:14.079 --> 00:19:17.519
Caption: doing all these wonderful crypto ads for

00:19:16.079 --> 00:19:19.918
Caption: those of you who&#39;ve not seen it matt

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.320
Caption: damon&#39;s ad where he compares investing

00:19:19.918 --> 00:19:24.558
Caption: in crypto to landing on the moon and

00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:27.119
Caption: basically causes all cowards for not

00:19:24.558 --> 00:19:28.399
Caption: investing has to be the worst advert

00:19:27.119 --> 00:19:31.280
Caption: i&#39;ve ever seen

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.919
Caption: or the larry super bowl ad don&#39;t be like

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.840
Caption: larry start investing today or paris

00:19:33.918 --> 00:19:37.839
Caption: hilton on late night talking about their

00:19:35.839 --> 00:19:40.479
Caption: nfts because this is the thing it

00:19:37.839 --> 00:19:42.880
Caption: doesn&#39;t generate value so to keep money

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:46.719
Caption: coming in they have to keep the hype

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:49.599
Caption: train going otherwise it stops

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:50.880
Caption: so let&#39;s explore this decentralized

00:19:49.599 --> 00:19:52.079
Caption: things we&#39;re going to shift lanes a

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.640
Caption: little bit here so we&#39;ve talked about

00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:57.038
Caption: the ford and scams and things but let&#39;s

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:59.039
Caption: talk about decentralized so that&#39;s

00:19:57.038 --> 00:20:01.279
Caption: that&#39;s one of the big touts that&#39;s

00:19:59.038 --> 00:20:02.399
Caption: decentralized we own it it&#39;s not owned

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.559
Caption: by people

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.440
Caption: but most of the major services in the

00:20:04.558 --> 00:20:10.079
Caption: web3 space are run on centralized

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:13.759
Caption: servers and just query the blockchain

00:20:10.079 --> 00:20:17.439
Caption: with an api if a miner owns 51 of a

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.798
Caption: network is it really decentralized

00:20:17.439 --> 00:20:20.479
Caption: and these are things that all worth

00:20:18.798 --> 00:20:22.239
Caption: thinking if you have to have a bank

00:20:20.479 --> 00:20:24.959
Caption: account and go through a centralized

00:20:22.239 --> 00:20:27.520
Caption: exchange to use a web3 app

00:20:24.959 --> 00:20:29.439
Caption: is it decentralized i have to admit i

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.959
Caption: set up a metamask wallet myself and it

00:20:29.439 --> 00:20:32.798
Caption: took me about half an hour and i&#39;m a

00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:35.199
Caption: developer so god knows how we&#39;re going

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:37.678
Caption: to get normal people to do it

00:20:35.199 --> 00:20:39.839
Caption: so i think moxie here sort of helps me

00:20:37.678 --> 00:20:41.279
Caption: with my decentralized argument so moxie

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:43.678
Caption: is one of the founders of signals so he

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.440
Caption: created this nft um if you want to go

00:20:43.678 --> 00:20:47.359
Caption: figure out how he did it it&#39;s up on his

00:20:45.439 --> 00:20:49.599
Caption: twitter but basically it looked

00:20:47.359 --> 00:20:52.079
Caption: different based on where you viewed it

00:20:49.599 --> 00:20:54.798
Caption: so if you viewed it on openc one of the

00:20:52.079 --> 00:20:57.760
Caption: biggest centralized platforms for buying

00:20:54.798 --> 00:20:59.599
Caption: and selling nfts it looked one way and

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.119
Caption: if you looked at it on variable another

00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:03.520
Caption: but if you looked at it in your crypto

00:21:01.119 --> 00:21:04.719
Caption: wallet it rendered out as a poo emoji

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.799
Caption: which is just

00:21:04.719 --> 00:21:09.599
Caption: absolutely fantastic

00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:12.239
Caption: but this is funny he was delisted from

00:21:09.599 --> 00:21:13.918
Caption: open c for violating their terms and

00:21:12.239 --> 00:21:16.400
Caption: conditions but i thought it was a

00:21:13.918 --> 00:21:18.558
Caption: censorship-free decentralized system

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.280
Caption: but it gets even better then his crypto

00:21:18.558 --> 00:21:23.279
Caption: wallet stopped showing the nft because

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:26.159
Caption: it turns out his crypto wallet just

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.479
Caption: queried open c&#39;s api to check for the

00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:30.640
Caption: nft&#39;s existence so

00:21:28.479 --> 00:21:32.239
Caption: none of that is decentralized that&#39;s all

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.678
Caption: using centralized

00:21:32.239 --> 00:21:35.760
Caption: services

00:21:33.678 --> 00:21:37.839
Caption: so let&#39;s dig into censorship resistance

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.719
Caption: a little bit now i want to start by

00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:41.119
Caption: saying

00:21:38.719 --> 00:21:44.558
Caption: i am a firm believer

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:46.798
Caption: in freedom of speech you have the right

00:21:44.558 --> 00:21:48.319
Caption: to say whatever you want and i think

00:21:46.798 --> 00:21:49.760
Caption: that should be right and it&#39;s very

00:21:48.319 --> 00:21:52.079
Caption: depressing in other countries where

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.798
Caption: governments use their power to suppress

00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:56.399
Caption: that but the thing is freedom of speech

00:21:54.798 --> 00:21:59.038

Caption: freedom of speech is plain wrong

00:22:03.038 --> 00:22:07.439
Caption: and i think we need to talk about this

00:22:04.719 --> 00:22:09.038
Caption: censorship resistant blockchain because

00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:12.158
Caption: the thing is there is stuff out there

00:22:09.038 --> 00:22:13.599
Caption: that needs censoring right since content

00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:15.679

00:22:13.599 --> 00:22:17.599
Caption: facebook and twitter they don&#39;t last

00:22:15.678 --> 00:22:20.000

00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:22.640

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000

00:22:28.319 --> 00:22:34.558
Caption: it happens all the time and needs to be

00:22:31.038 --> 00:22:36.959
Caption: censored if we create a censorship

00:22:34.558 --> 00:22:40.959
Caption: resistant complete system we are going

00:22:36.959 --> 00:22:44.719
Caption: to allow child pornography hate racism

00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:46.640

00:22:44.719 --> 00:22:48.479
Caption: really a great place

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.159
Caption: and let&#39;s expand on that a little bit

00:22:48.479 --> 00:22:52.959
Caption: and talk about the death of privacy so

00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:55.600
Caption: i&#39;m a big privacy advocate i go out of

00:22:52.959 --> 00:22:58.079
Caption: my way at the start up i work at to try

00:22:55.599 --> 00:23:00.400
Caption: and respect privacy as much as possible

00:22:58.079 --> 00:23:02.558
Caption: even building analytics in a different

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.960
Caption: way all that sort of stuff

00:23:02.558 --> 00:23:07.520
Caption: and privacy is important and blockchain

00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:09.359
Caption: often gets touted as it&#39;s more secure

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.880
Caption: it&#39;s the data in your hands and look we

00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:11.918
Caption: should have data in our hands i agree

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.479
Caption: with that

00:23:11.918 --> 00:23:16.798
Caption: but the thing is it&#39;s not really private

00:23:14.479 --> 00:23:20.400
Caption: because i cannot stress this enough it&#39;s

00:23:16.798 --> 00:23:22.880
Caption: a public ledger everything you do is

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.880
Caption: visible to the public now if you don&#39;t

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.520
Caption: connect that identity to anything in the

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:30.479
Caption: real world sure it gives you the ability

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:32.558
Caption: to harass and annoy and disappear right

00:23:30.479 --> 00:23:34.880
Caption: but the second you start connecting it

00:23:32.558 --> 00:23:36.880
Caption: to anything in the real world or someone

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.199
Caption: figures out that that wallet belongs to

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.359
Caption: you everything you do is going to be

00:23:39.199 --> 00:23:43.760
Caption: available for everyone to see we&#39;re

00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:45.918
Caption: talking privacy violations

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.359
Caption: way worse than google and facebook have

00:23:45.918 --> 00:23:49.519
Caption: ever committed

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:51.119
Caption: especially when you&#39;ve got things like

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.000
Caption: this

00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:56.558
Caption: ethereum co-founder says we&#39;ll soon use

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.880
Caption: soul bound tokens to verify things like

00:23:56.558 --> 00:24:00.959
Caption: school and employment all stored in a

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.400
Caption: soul&#39;s wallet i don&#39;t even know what any

00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:05.038
Caption: of that means

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.479
Caption: but the thing is once we start attaching

00:24:05.038 --> 00:24:07.918
Caption: things like that to the blockchain

00:24:06.479 --> 00:24:09.520
Caption: that&#39;s there forever because remember it

00:24:07.918 --> 00:24:11.519
Caption: can&#39;t be deleted

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.839
Caption: even if it&#39;s fought it can still be

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.679
Caption: found you know accidentally take a photo

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:18.079
Caption: with your credit card in the background

00:24:15.678 --> 00:24:20.399
Caption: that&#39;s up there forever somebody uploads

00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:22.640
Caption: revenge point of view that&#39;s up there

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.080
Caption: forever it&#39;s never going away and i

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.239
Caption: think there&#39;s another thing worth

00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:28.319
Caption: mentioning is that most of the people

00:24:26.239 --> 00:24:31.278
Caption: working in this space are straight white

00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:32.479
Caption: men like me and we don&#39;t experience

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:34.960
Caption: harassment

00:24:32.479 --> 00:24:37.839
Caption: stalking in the same way that people of

00:24:34.959 --> 00:24:39.918
Caption: color or women do we just don&#39;t

00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:41.520
Caption: and the thing is that stuff will become

00:24:39.918 --> 00:24:44.959
Caption: easier to do

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:47.039
Caption: like i said privacy will disappear

00:24:44.959 --> 00:24:49.599
Caption: so we&#39;re running short on time because

00:24:47.038 --> 00:24:51.038
Caption: we start a little bit late so let&#39;s just

00:24:49.599 --> 00:24:52.640
Caption: just cool off a little bit alex and

00:24:51.038 --> 00:24:55.599
Caption: we&#39;ll go into financialization of

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.200
Caption: everything um so so one of the end goals

00:24:55.599 --> 00:24:59.199
Caption: of the web 3 space right is that

00:24:57.199 --> 00:25:01.119
Caption: everything is on the chain everything

00:24:59.199 --> 00:25:03.599
Caption: you do is on the chamber incentivized

00:25:01.119 --> 00:25:05.839
Caption: for our time with earning tokens

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:07.599
Caption: uh you pay for everything on the chain

00:25:05.839 --> 00:25:10.479
Caption: and i think one real good example of

00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:13.038
Caption: this is axi infinity uh which is a video

00:25:10.479 --> 00:25:14.719
Caption: game using nfts and blockchains

00:25:13.038 --> 00:25:16.639
Caption: it&#39;s pretty much just pokemon it&#39;s

00:25:14.719 --> 00:25:18.239
Caption: pokemon with nfts

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.880
Caption: um so the way it works is you buy or

00:25:18.239 --> 00:25:22.959
Caption: rent three nfts called axes

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.119
Caption: um and then you battle them and you earn

00:25:22.959 --> 00:25:27.278
Caption: tokens for battling and you use those

00:25:25.119 --> 00:25:28.880
Caption: tokens to breed more axes or you can

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:30.080
Caption: cash out for real

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.000
Caption: money

00:25:30.079 --> 00:25:33.278
Caption: now it&#39;s very expensive to get started

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.279
Caption: like when it first started it was very

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:37.440
Caption: low it can be cost a few hundred dollars

00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:39.279
Caption: at least to set up one team one thing

00:25:37.439 --> 00:25:41.519
Caption: you can do is set up a bunch of teams

00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:44.159
Caption: and rent them out to people and then you

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:46.558
Caption: earn 50 of whatever they&#39;re doing now

00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:48.000
Caption: they&#39;ve got a lot of good press

00:25:46.558 --> 00:25:49.678
Caption: about how they help people in the

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.439
Caption: philippines earn money you know it&#39;s

Caption: like hey these people are now earning

00:25:51.439 --> 00:25:55.599
Caption: money you know playing a video game but

00:25:53.439 --> 00:25:57.678
Caption: the thing is play to earn is not play to

00:25:55.599 --> 00:26:00.158
Caption: have fun so when we had the crypto crash

00:25:57.678 --> 00:26:02.079
Caption: earlier this year they saw their player

00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:03.440
Caption: numbers drop massively because people

00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:05.599

00:26:03.439 --> 00:26:07.038
Caption: were just grinding to earn money and

00:26:05.599 --> 00:26:09.199

00:26:14.719 --> 00:26:19.359
Caption: sounds a bit like a sweat factory but

00:26:16.798 --> 00:26:20.959
Caption: let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s investigate that

00:26:19.359 --> 00:26:23.199
Caption: good press on how many people in the

00:26:20.959 --> 00:26:25.359

Caption: bank account right so make remember you

00:26:30.479 --> 00:26:35.199
Caption: need a bank account to buy crypto and

00:26:32.719 --> 00:26:37.278
Caption: play crypto and work with crypto so how

00:26:35.199 --> 00:26:38.798
Caption: many people are we actually helping i

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:41.200
Caption: feel that&#39;s one of the things that we do

00:26:38.798 --> 00:26:43.599
Caption: in tech a lot it&#39;s like this solves this

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:45.278
Caption: problem we should do it but we never

00:26:43.599 --> 00:26:48.079
Caption: actually talk to the people we say we&#39;re

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:50.159
Caption: helping you know and i think uh example

00:26:48.079 --> 00:26:52.319
Caption: outside of the web three space you might

00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:54.080
Caption: hate me for this and this is okay is

00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:56.079
Caption: elon musk&#39;s satellite system for

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:57.760
Caption: internet right like he&#39;s like oh we&#39;re

00:26:56.079 --> 00:27:00.158
Caption: bringing internet to people in the

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.320
Caption: regions have we asked them what they

00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:03.919
Caption: want it&#39;s internet top of their list i&#39;m

00:27:02.319 --> 00:27:05.278
Caption: pretty sure that if you talk to most

00:27:03.918 --> 00:27:08.079
Caption: people living in the regions they&#39;d be

00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:10.480
Caption: like uh 24-hour access to doctors and

00:27:08.079 --> 00:27:12.239
Caption: nurses more public services and

00:27:10.479 --> 00:27:14.400
Caption: infrastructure that isn&#39;t falling apart

00:27:12.239 --> 00:27:16.079
Caption: and 50 years old you know not saying the

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.599
Caption: internet isn&#39;t important but it&#39;s one of

00:27:16.079 --> 00:27:19.038
Caption: those things where like let&#39;s just shove

00:27:17.599 --> 00:27:20.798
Caption: a whole bunch of satellites in the

00:27:19.038 --> 00:27:22.239
Caption: atmosphere every year and not think

00:27:20.798 --> 00:27:25.678
Caption: about the consequences because

00:27:22.239 --> 00:27:27.918
Caption: apparently we&#39;re doing some good

00:27:25.678 --> 00:27:30.640
Caption: and in the end it&#39;s people that lose

00:27:27.918 --> 00:27:32.558
Caption: right like it&#39;s people that get left out

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.320
Caption: it&#39;s people that suffer the consequences

00:27:32.558 --> 00:27:36.798
Caption: of us just charging ahead and doing

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:38.558
Caption: something i think not a week goes by

00:27:36.798 --> 00:27:40.399
Caption: where people aren&#39;t like oh let&#39;s stick

00:27:38.558 --> 00:27:42.719
Caption: this on the blockchain for example let&#39;s

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.119
Caption: put power distribution and on the

00:27:42.719 --> 00:27:47.199
Caption: blockchain that will make things better

00:27:45.119 --> 00:27:48.798
Caption: but then who decides when we disconnect

00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:50.959
Caption: someone when they&#39;re struggling with

00:27:48.798 --> 00:27:52.880
Caption: finances who decides that we keep

00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:55.760
Caption: someone connected to the power because

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:58.239
Caption: they&#39;ve got medical devices if we

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.919
Caption: create this decentralized system a

00:27:58.239 --> 00:28:02.719
Caption: really good example is if you take

00:27:59.918 --> 00:28:04.558
Caption: synergy or state-owned power company and

00:28:02.719 --> 00:28:06.558
Caption: you compare that to all the private

00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:08.079
Caption: companies over east which is a little

00:28:06.558 --> 00:28:09.520
Caption: bit like a blockchain they all don&#39;t

00:28:08.079 --> 00:28:12.079
Caption: really work together that well they all

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.279
Caption: do whatever they want our disconnection

00:28:12.079 --> 00:28:16.719
Caption: rate

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:19.440
Caption: our disconnection rate in wa for people

00:28:16.719 --> 00:28:21.278
Caption: in financial hardship is much lower

00:28:19.439 --> 00:28:22.879
Caption: because we have a centralized system

00:28:21.279 --> 00:28:25.039
Caption: working together

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.640
Caption: you know look at myspace the environment

00:28:25.038 --> 00:28:29.519
Caption: space everyone&#39;s like oh if we put

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.520
Caption: offsets on the blockchain it fixes them

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.119
Caption: you know we need carbon offsets to

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.719
Caption: offset some emissions that are

00:28:33.119 --> 00:28:38.319
Caption: unavoidable but the thing is the

00:28:34.719 --> 00:28:40.319
Caption: industry is rife with lies fraud kicking

00:28:38.319 --> 00:28:42.239
Caption: people off their own land in third world

00:28:40.319 --> 00:28:44.479
Caption: countries and the thing is how does

00:28:42.239 --> 00:28:46.479
Caption: sticking that on the blockchain fix it

00:28:44.479 --> 00:28:48.398
Caption: one it doesn&#39;t stop people lying before

00:28:46.479 --> 00:28:50.239
Caption: they put data in there and all it does

00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:51.760
Caption: is create another financial market on

00:28:50.239 --> 00:28:53.199
Caption: top of the other

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.880
Caption: and i think that&#39;s the biggest thing

00:28:53.199 --> 00:28:57.678
Caption: that i want you guys to take away from

00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:00.719
Caption: this is that tech alone isn&#39;t going to

00:28:57.678 --> 00:29:03.038
Caption: save us we have to actually trust each

00:29:00.719 --> 00:29:04.959
Caption: other and work together and stop just

00:29:03.038 --> 00:29:07.038
Caption: pushing ahead with tech because it seems

00:29:04.959 --> 00:29:09.520
Caption: cool of fun

00:29:07.038 --> 00:29:12.158
Caption: so please just remember we can trust

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:15.440
Caption: each other we can work together and

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:17.440

Caption: there&#39;s morning tea in all the foyers

00:29:55.119 --> 00:30:00.158
Caption: the next session is starting at 11 25 so

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.440
Caption: is there anyone who&#39;s got a question for

00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:03.440
Caption: alex before we wrap up

00:30:04.479 --> 00:30:07.880
Caption: oh dear

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.839
Caption: so the hype train&#39;s real

00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:16.880
Caption: how do we get investors

00:30:13.839 --> 00:30:19.520
Caption: in startups to avoid throwing cash at

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.199
Caption: shiny things that have web 3 and

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.039
Caption: crypto in them oh

00:30:21.199 --> 00:30:24.639
Caption: see so that&#39;s a difficult question right

00:30:23.038 --> 00:30:27.599
Caption: and i don&#39;t have a perfect answer for

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:29.279
Caption: that um because i work for a startup too

00:30:27.599 --> 00:30:31.278
Caption: and i&#39;ve seen other companies just come

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:32.320
Caption: along with a wild idea get millions of

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:34.159
Caption: dollars and

00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:36.639
Caption: we only ever got a few hundred thousand

00:30:34.159 --> 00:30:38.480
Caption: to start with so i think i think there&#39;s

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.320
Caption: that thing where it&#39;s like you have to

00:30:38.479 --> 00:30:42.640
Caption: look at is endless growth always a good

00:30:40.319 --> 00:30:45.119
Caption: thing can i bootstrap a startup with

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.760
Caption: income first before i go to investors

00:30:45.119 --> 00:30:49.359
Caption: and just try and avoid those investors

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:52.000
Caption: which means less stuff will be built

00:30:49.359 --> 00:30:53.760
Caption: that doesn&#39;t have web3 but hey maybe we

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.199
Caption: have a slightly better society for it as

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.959
Caption: well too

00:30:55.199 --> 00:31:00.719
Caption: awesome answer any other questions

00:30:58.959 --> 00:31:03.199
Caption: yeah just be curious in your

00:31:00.719 --> 00:31:04.319
Caption: opinion on whether there exists maybe a

00:31:03.199 --> 00:31:05.918
Caption: possibility for some sort of

00:31:04.319 --> 00:31:07.599
Caption: decentralized financial product for

00:31:05.918 --> 00:31:09.519
Caption: example i&#39;m thinking of the problems on

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:10.719
Caption: the internet with a mastercard and visa

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.880
Caption: stranglehold

00:31:10.719 --> 00:31:15.599
Caption: on certain services

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.359
Caption: yeah so i do have an answer for this and

00:31:15.599 --> 00:31:18.479
Caption: some of you might not like it

00:31:17.359 --> 00:31:21.599
Caption: so

00:31:18.479 --> 00:31:23.119
Caption: i agree things like internet and payment

00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:25.119
Caption: actually internet infrastructure not

00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:28.000
Caption: just payment infrastructure is a

00:31:25.119 --> 00:31:31.279
Caption: necessary for today&#39;s world right just

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.678
Caption: like electricity and water and necessity

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:35.200
Caption: so maybe it&#39;s time that certain

00:31:33.678 --> 00:31:37.199
Caption: infrastructure

00:31:35.199 --> 00:31:40.239
Caption: isn&#39;t actually owned by private

00:31:37.199 --> 00:31:42.398
Caption: companies anymore but actually a public

00:31:40.239 --> 00:31:44.719
Caption: owned good now look yeah governments

00:31:42.399 --> 00:31:46.799
Caption: have some bad reputations for running

00:31:44.719 --> 00:31:48.719
Caption: things but the thing is maybe that&#39;s

00:31:46.798 --> 00:31:51.839
Caption: actually what starts to need to happen

00:31:48.719 --> 00:31:54.158
Caption: maybe we need a publicly owned payment

00:31:51.839 --> 00:31:56.239
Caption: infrastructure maybe we need publicly

00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:58.080
Caption: owned infinite internet and server

00:31:56.239 --> 00:32:00.239
Caption: infrastructure because the thing is we

00:31:58.079 --> 00:32:02.158
Caption: actually need it to function and maybe

00:32:00.239 --> 00:32:05.119
Caption: it&#39;s time we modernize our governments a

00:32:02.159 --> 00:32:06.320
Caption: little bit to make that possible

00:32:05.119 --> 00:32:10.760
Caption: thank you

00:32:06.319 --> 00:32:10.759
Caption: fantastic any other questions

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:18.000
Caption: i was just gonna ask so

00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:19.678
Caption: obviously in the late 90s we had the the

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.959
Caption: dot-com bubble where a bunch of

00:32:19.678 --> 00:32:23.038
Caption: companies went on the internet and they

00:32:20.959 --> 00:32:25.038
Caption: didn&#39;t have to and everything just kind

00:32:23.038 --> 00:32:27.038
Caption: of went straight down downhill from

00:32:25.038 --> 00:32:28.959
Caption: there yeah but obviously the underlying

00:32:27.038 --> 00:32:30.239
Caption: technology was somewhat useful in the

00:32:28.959 --> 00:32:32.479
Caption: modern world

00:32:30.239 --> 00:32:34.640
Caption: so do you feel the whole system of web 3

00:32:32.479 --> 00:32:36.959
Caption: as a whole is completely useless or is

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.799
Caption: it more that it&#39;s kind of the wild wild

00:32:36.959 --> 00:32:40.798
Caption: rest right now i

00:32:38.798 --> 00:32:42.239
Caption: personally i agree

00:32:40.798 --> 00:32:43.839
Caption: that it is useless but that&#39;s my

00:32:42.239 --> 00:32:45.359
Caption: personal opinion and i i disagree with

00:32:43.839 --> 00:32:46.880
Caption: the wild wild west because although

00:32:45.359 --> 00:32:49.278
Caption: there was a bit of while west when the

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.279
Caption: dot-com bubble happened there wasn&#39;t

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:53.279
Caption: this level of fraud and scams right

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:55.039
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s this is insane if this was

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:57.039
Caption: happening in the banking industry on a

00:32:55.038 --> 00:32:59.439
Caption: daily basis it will be on the news every

00:32:57.038 --> 00:33:00.719
Caption: night right like it&#39;s and and the thing

00:32:59.439 --> 00:33:02.398
Caption: is look maybe there is a use for

00:33:00.719 --> 00:33:04.079
Caption: blockchain that i&#39;m not aware of right

00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:05.440
Caption: that we could actually do but

00:33:04.079 --> 00:33:07.199
Caption: technically don&#39;t we already have that

00:33:05.439 --> 00:33:09.678
Caption: and i think it&#39;s called git you know

00:33:07.199 --> 00:33:12.239
Caption: like it&#39;s uh

00:33:09.678 --> 00:33:13.760
Caption: maybe we already found the use case um

00:33:12.239 --> 00:33:16.158
Caption: look i just i just want people to be

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.239
Caption: protected so you know really i think the

00:33:16.159 --> 00:33:19.919
Caption: industry should be regulated and i think

00:33:18.239 --> 00:33:22.000
Caption: you&#39;d find if that happened it would

00:33:19.918 --> 00:33:24.639
Caption: probably mostly disappear because like i

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.279
Caption: said it&#39;s zero sum by design

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.279
Caption: awesome uh one last question over here

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.039
Caption: uh so you talked about uh public

00:33:33.439 --> 00:33:37.439
Caption: ownership or government ownership is

00:33:35.038 --> 00:33:39.518
Caption: there any initiatives like that

00:33:37.439 --> 00:33:40.558
Caption: they&#39;ve uh started or are they thinking

00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:43.039
Caption: about it

00:33:40.558 --> 00:33:44.719
Caption: no no there isn&#39;t uh which sucks right i

00:33:43.038 --> 00:33:46.000
Caption: mean there are some people in america

00:33:44.719 --> 00:33:48.079
Caption: talking about it

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.918
Caption: um but i think that&#39;s actually what

00:33:48.079 --> 00:33:52.079
Caption: needs to happen right we need to stop

00:33:49.918 --> 00:33:53.599
Caption: saying oh you know government&#39;s terrible

00:33:52.079 --> 00:33:55.199
Caption: at running this well let&#39;s make a

00:33:53.599 --> 00:33:57.038
Caption: government good at running this right i

00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:59.119
Caption: know people push for privatization of

00:33:57.038 --> 00:34:00.639
Caption: synergy and look we&#39;re delving into my

00:33:59.119 --> 00:34:01.839
Caption: personal beliefs a little bit here but

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.119
Caption: that&#39;s okay

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:05.278
Caption: and you&#39;re allowed to disagree with me

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:07.279
Caption: but i believe our energy should be state

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:09.599
Caption: owned you know it kept our power prices

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:11.599
Caption: lower most of the time it leads to

00:34:09.599 --> 00:34:13.839
Caption: better things this whole thing of choice

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:15.839
Caption: in certain things is important but when

00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:17.520
Caption: it&#39;s infrastructure so really maybe

00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:19.440
Caption: working in the tech space we should all

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.359
Caption: start pushing for that because it is

00:34:19.439 --> 00:34:23.520
Caption: needed

00:34:21.358 --> 00:34:25.598

Caption: himself now yes and i&#39;m james number two

01:07:19.679 --> 01:07:23.520
Caption: james number one just slightly cooler

01:07:22.479 --> 01:07:25.280
Caption: i

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.959
Caption: my interest in cyber security began when

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:29.280
Caption: i was working at bankwest in the grad

01:07:26.959 --> 01:07:31.679
Caption: program i spent six months working there

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:33.839
Caption: in the security operations centre

01:07:31.679 --> 01:07:35.679
Caption: and the team there was super passionate

01:07:33.839 --> 01:07:38.319
Caption: about security and that ended up rubbing

01:07:35.679 --> 01:07:40.000
Caption: off on me a little bit from there i

01:07:38.319 --> 01:07:42.799
Caption: started participating in things like

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.199
Caption: hack the box wactf much the same as

01:07:42.799 --> 01:07:45.199
Caption: james

01:07:45.439 --> 01:07:50.318
Caption: james and i met together when we were

01:07:47.679 --> 01:07:53.199
Caption: working for six months at bankwest under

01:07:50.319 --> 01:07:56.160
Caption: piers who&#39;s in the room

01:07:53.199 --> 01:07:58.078
Caption: we&#39;ve kept in touch ever since and james

01:07:56.159 --> 01:08:00.558
Caption: suggested the idea of

01:07:58.079 --> 01:08:02.160
Caption: doing a ddd talk together

01:08:00.559 --> 01:08:03.760
Caption: i pitched the idea of doing a choose

01:08:02.159 --> 01:08:05.679
Caption: your own pentest adventure because it&#39;s

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.959
Caption: something that i&#39;m interested in and

01:08:05.679 --> 01:08:08.239
Caption: that&#39;s the idea we ended up sticking

01:08:06.959 --> 01:08:10.559
Caption: with

01:08:08.239 --> 01:08:13.118
Caption: we also like to do gymnastics together

01:08:10.559 --> 01:08:13.119
Caption: on the weekly

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:17.439
Caption: uh so the goals of the session

01:08:15.599 --> 01:08:20.319
Caption: we&#39;ve got four main goals that we&#39;d like

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:21.919
Caption: the audience to take away from this

01:08:20.318 --> 01:08:24.718
Caption: as long as you tick off at least one of

01:08:21.919 --> 01:08:26.158
Caption: those i&#39;ll be satisfied uh we&#39;d like to

01:08:24.719 --> 01:08:28.319
Caption: give everyone here a little bit of a

01:08:26.159 --> 01:08:31.120
Caption: peek at what breaking into

01:08:28.318 --> 01:08:32.479
Caption: a website or a service looks like

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.399
Caption: certainly when i was working as a

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:36.640
Caption: software engineer i

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:38.399
Caption: very rarely got to see what that looks

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:40.319
Caption: like i knew that managing

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:42.399
Caption: vulnerabilities was important and

01:08:40.318 --> 01:08:43.919
Caption: avoiding flaws that let people break in

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:47.040
Caption: was important but i never actually got

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:48.560
Caption: to see it practically applied

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:50.239
Caption: we&#39;d also like to share with you all

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.120
Caption: some practical tips for the engineers in

01:08:50.238 --> 01:08:54.479
Caption: the room hopefully whatever service or

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.879
Caption: application you&#39;re working on at the

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:58.640
Caption: moment won&#39;t be

01:08:56.879 --> 01:09:01.040
Caption: vulnerable in the same way that our demo

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.799
Caption: website will be

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.560
Caption: we&#39;d also like audience participation

01:09:02.798 --> 01:09:07.358
Caption: we&#39;ve formed this as a choose your own

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.879
Caption: adventure we want the audience to feel

01:09:07.358 --> 01:09:10.318
Caption: empowered to actually make some of the

01:09:08.879 --> 01:09:11.919
Caption: decisions that are going to drive this

01:09:10.318 --> 01:09:13.599
Caption: live demo

01:09:11.919 --> 01:09:14.640
Caption: so we&#39;re hoping to give you enough

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.759
Caption: context

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.439
Caption: that you

01:09:15.758 --> 01:09:19.520
Caption: feel comfortable making a bit of a

01:09:17.439 --> 01:09:21.358
Caption: decision and participating

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.159
Caption: which will hopefully lead to number four

01:09:21.358 --> 01:09:26.399
Caption: which is giving you some inspiration

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:27.600
Caption: if anyone in the room is interested

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:29.358
Caption: definitely hit me up afterwards but

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:32.080
Caption: we&#39;ll also be sharing some resources at

01:09:29.358 --> 01:09:34.560
Caption: the end for anyone who thinks this looks

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:36.879
Caption: cool and wants to do more of it to go

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:39.120
Caption: and do it on the in their own time after

01:09:36.879 --> 01:09:42.318
Caption: this session so really hoping that some

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:44.560
Caption: of you take that away from this

01:09:42.318 --> 01:09:46.238
Caption: so how&#39;s the adventure choose your own

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:48.479
Caption: adventure actually going to work we&#39;re

01:09:46.238 --> 01:09:51.039
Caption: going to start off by doing a bit of

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:53.358
Caption: giving you a bit of context we&#39;ll um

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.879
Caption: browse around the website at whatever

01:09:53.358 --> 01:09:56.560
Caption: point we&#39;re at

01:09:54.879 --> 01:09:58.799
Caption: point out some interesting things that

01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.199
Caption: we&#39;ve spotted and then we&#39;ll go into

01:09:58.799 --> 01:10:03.439
Caption: explaining some of the options that uh

01:10:01.199 --> 01:10:04.719
Caption: that are available to us

01:10:03.439 --> 01:10:06.159
Caption: from there you&#39;ll see a screen that

01:10:04.719 --> 01:10:08.960
Caption: looks much like this one so have your

01:10:06.159 --> 01:10:10.479
Caption: phones ready there&#39;s a qr code if you&#39;re

01:10:08.959 --> 01:10:12.000
Caption: at the back it might struggle to scan

01:10:10.479 --> 01:10:13.600
Caption: but we&#39;ll also read you out the six

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.359
Caption: digit number

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.120
Caption: so you can use one or the other you

01:10:15.359 --> 01:10:18.879
Caption: either go to strawpol.live and enter the

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:21.199
Caption: six digit code or

01:10:18.879 --> 01:10:22.959
Caption: you scan the qr code on your phone both

01:10:21.199 --> 01:10:24.159
Caption: will take you to a

01:10:22.959 --> 01:10:26.879
Caption: actual

01:10:24.159 --> 01:10:28.959
Caption: straw poll where you can cast your votes

01:10:26.879 --> 01:10:31.359
Caption: this one&#39;s not the real one so this is

01:10:28.959 --> 01:10:34.319
Caption: just a demo one i see people think the

01:10:31.359 --> 01:10:35.198
Caption: qr code won&#39;t work

01:10:34.319 --> 01:10:36.799
Caption: all right

01:10:35.199 --> 01:10:38.000
Caption: i&#39;m gonna hop on the keyboard now and

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:40.158
Caption: james is gonna

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.719
Caption: narrate while i start exploring the

01:10:40.159 --> 01:10:44.880
Caption: website

01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:48.159
Caption: right so the app that we&#39;re going to be

01:10:44.879 --> 01:10:49.919
Caption: pen testing is a an online pen store um

01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:52.320
Caption: unfortunately because of some vpn issues

01:10:49.919 --> 01:10:53.678
Caption: the thumbnails are not loading but um

01:10:52.319 --> 01:10:54.959
Caption: these are various different pens that

01:10:53.679 --> 01:10:56.880
Caption: you can browse through and add to your

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:58.799
Caption: cart there&#39;s also a search feature up

01:10:56.879 --> 01:11:00.158
Caption: here you can type in a query and it&#39;ll

01:10:58.799 --> 01:11:02.000
Caption: filter the list

01:11:00.159 --> 01:11:04.159
Caption: to ones that match that query there&#39;s a

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.839
Caption: gallery here once again vpn issues so

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:07.840
Caption: the content is not loading

01:11:05.839 --> 01:11:09.119
Caption: but imagine there&#39;s some beautiful pen

01:11:07.839 --> 01:11:11.439
Caption: pictures here

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.879
Caption: finally we see a login page so we know

01:11:11.439 --> 01:11:14.080
Caption: there&#39;s some kind of account system on

01:11:12.879 --> 01:11:15.600
Caption: this website

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:18.719
Caption: we&#39;re going to register an account for

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.719
Caption: the purposes of this test

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.640
Caption: so there&#39;s obviously no password policy

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:26.718
Caption: because we&#39;re not getting any validation

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:29.199
Caption: errors so we&#39;ve just put in test as a

01:11:26.719 --> 01:11:29.199
Caption: password

01:11:31.759 --> 01:11:34.399
Caption: we connected

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.319
Caption: all right i might swap across to the

01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:40.800
Caption: video it looks like we&#39;re gonna have to

01:11:38.319 --> 01:11:45.599
Caption: fall back on a pre-recorded video

01:11:40.799 --> 01:11:45.599
Caption: because our vpn is uh acting up

01:11:50.959 --> 01:11:55.679
Caption: obviously we&#39;ve

01:11:53.679 --> 01:11:57.199
Caption: we&#39;ve registered our user we&#39;re logging

01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:59.199
Caption: in now

01:11:57.199 --> 01:12:00.640
Caption: yep so obviously a different user um

01:11:59.199 --> 01:12:02.880
Caption: given that it&#39;s pre-recorded so once

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:04.800
Caption: you&#39;re in there&#39;s a profile page here um

01:12:02.879 --> 01:12:06.479
Caption: and in that page you can update some of

01:12:04.799 --> 01:12:09.119
Caption: your profile details so your name and

01:12:06.479 --> 01:12:10.879
Caption: email address

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:13.120
Caption: and uh looking at the url we can see

01:12:10.879 --> 01:12:15.439
Caption: this is hosted in s3 so that tells us

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:17.120
Caption: that it&#39;s a static website um so we&#39;re

01:12:15.439 --> 01:12:19.520
Caption: gonna kind of browse through the

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:21.840
Caption: javascript code that&#39;s um we can see in

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:23.439
Caption: the dev tools and see if we can um find

01:12:21.839 --> 01:12:25.198
Caption: anything interesting

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:27.279
Caption: so we&#39;re going to start noticing that

01:12:25.199 --> 01:12:28.640
Caption: it&#39;s react um

01:12:27.279 --> 01:12:30.399
Caption: and we&#39;re just going to try to enumerate

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.840
Caption: the routes that are available to see if

01:12:30.399 --> 01:12:34.319
Caption: there&#39;s any pages that we haven&#39;t been

01:12:31.839 --> 01:12:35.599
Caption: able to find yet um so we&#39;ll do that by

01:12:34.319 --> 01:12:37.198
Caption: prettifying the code and then we&#39;re

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.679
Caption: going to search for a route that we know

01:12:37.199 --> 01:12:41.360
Caption: exists in this case slash login

01:12:39.679 --> 01:12:42.880
Caption: and we&#39;ve immediately found a list of

01:12:41.359 --> 01:12:44.080
Caption: all of the routes

01:12:42.879 --> 01:12:46.718
Caption: so one that we

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:48.800
Caption: um haven&#39;t seen yet that&#39;s interesting

01:12:46.719 --> 01:12:51.120
Caption: is this add product page

01:12:48.799 --> 01:12:53.599
Caption: so we&#39;re just gonna go and navigate into

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:56.399
Caption: that and see if um there&#39;s anything

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.399
Caption: interesting there

01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:06.159
Caption: all right so we get a forbidden error so

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.760
Caption: immediately that tells us we&#39;ve got some

01:13:06.159 --> 01:13:08.719
Caption: kind of role-based access control in

01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:10.799
Caption: place

01:13:08.719 --> 01:13:13.280
Caption: um so next order of business we&#39;re going

01:13:10.799 --> 01:13:14.399
Caption: to try to enumerate the roles that exist

01:13:13.279 --> 01:13:15.759
Caption: um so we&#39;re just going to search for

01:13:14.399 --> 01:13:19.040
Caption: strings that tend to appear in role

01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:21.439
Caption: names guest user admin and it looks like

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.120
Caption: we found a map of roles and it looks

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:25.040
Caption: like admin and user are the only two

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.320
Caption: roles that are defined

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.080
Caption: since we didn&#39;t have access to add

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:31.040
Caption: product page we can deduce that we&#39;re

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:32.239
Caption: probably just a normal user

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.399
Caption: but we&#39;re going to confirm that by

01:13:32.238 --> 01:13:35.839
Caption: looking in local storage which is where

01:13:34.399 --> 01:13:37.198
Caption: single page apps tend to put their

01:13:35.839 --> 01:13:39.599
Caption: session data

01:13:37.199 --> 01:13:43.280
Caption: and uh we can see here that there&#39;s a

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:45.280
Caption: role field and we are indeed a user

01:13:43.279 --> 01:13:47.839
Caption: right so having seen that that gives us

01:13:45.279 --> 01:13:49.599
Caption: our first goal which is going to be to

01:13:47.839 --> 01:13:50.319
Caption: become the website admin

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.359
Caption: so

01:13:50.319 --> 01:13:53.520
Caption: let&#39;s look at the options that are

01:13:51.359 --> 01:13:55.600
Caption: available to do that

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.719
Caption: so the first option classic sql

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.879
Caption: injection

01:13:56.719 --> 01:14:01.199
Caption: 12 hands if you&#39;ve heard of it

01:13:58.879 --> 01:14:02.560
Caption: yeah pretty much pretty much everyone um

01:14:01.199 --> 01:14:03.920
Caption: so in our case we have this search

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.120
Caption: feature which is probably a good

01:14:03.919 --> 01:14:09.198
Caption: candidate um so if our products are

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:12.080
Caption: stored in a sql database which is being

01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:14.400
Caption: queried to uh produce the search results

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:17.199
Caption: um we can assume that our query might

01:14:14.399 --> 01:14:19.678
Caption: end up embedded in a query like this

01:14:17.199 --> 01:14:21.360
Caption: where it&#39;s filtering on rows that have a

01:14:19.679 --> 01:14:24.479
Caption: description field containing our search

01:14:21.359 --> 01:14:27.040
Caption: term uh now if the website is vulnerable

01:14:24.479 --> 01:14:29.359
Caption: to sql injection

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.040
Caption: we would imagine that we could put in a

01:14:29.359 --> 01:14:33.279
Caption: query that can escape this context and

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.879
Caption: do something more malicious with it

01:14:33.279 --> 01:14:36.879
Caption: but there&#39;ll be more detail on that if

01:14:34.879 --> 01:14:38.718
Caption: we choose that option

01:14:36.879 --> 01:14:40.639
Caption: second option

01:14:38.719 --> 01:14:41.440
Caption: is mass assignment

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.479
Caption: so

01:14:41.439 --> 01:14:43.839
Caption: this one

01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:45.759
Caption: relies on the fact that we know that

01:14:43.839 --> 01:14:48.000
Caption: there&#39;s some kind of admin user we know

01:14:45.759 --> 01:14:49.519
Caption: that we can register a basic user and

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.839
Caption: the question is can we upgrade our

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.520
Caption: existing user or register a new one as

01:14:51.839 --> 01:14:54.319
Caption: an admin

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.000
Caption: so

01:14:54.319 --> 01:14:58.479
Caption: um we can assume that there&#39;s some kind

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.159
Caption: of roll column stored in the user data

01:14:58.479 --> 01:15:02.479
Caption: if there&#39;s an api endpoint that doesn&#39;t

01:15:00.159 --> 01:15:04.640
Caption: enforce proper validation uh it may

01:15:02.479 --> 01:15:06.718
Caption: allow us to overwrite some fields that

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:09.679
Caption: we&#39;re not supposed to by forcibly

01:15:06.719 --> 01:15:11.920
Caption: providing extra input and thereby force

01:15:09.679 --> 01:15:13.600
Caption: our user to become an admin

01:15:11.919 --> 01:15:14.479
Caption: again more detail on that if we choose

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.479
Caption: it

01:15:14.479 --> 01:15:18.159
Caption: finally brute forcing pretty simple if

01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:18.879
Caption: we spam login attempts we might be able

01:15:18.159 --> 01:15:21.040
Caption: to

01:15:18.879 --> 01:15:22.479
Caption: ascertain the user the admins username

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.080
Caption: and password we don&#39;t know their

01:15:22.479 --> 01:15:24.799
Caption: username but we can take some guesses at

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.879
Caption: it

01:15:24.799 --> 01:15:29.439
Caption: um again we&#39;ll look at that in more

01:15:26.879 --> 01:15:31.279
Caption: detail if that&#39;s what gets chosen

01:15:29.439 --> 01:15:33.040
Caption: all right so you&#39;ve seen all the options

01:15:31.279 --> 01:15:34.158
Caption: now it&#39;s time to vote uh if you&#39;re at

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:37.040
Caption: the back and you&#39;re having trouble

01:15:34.159 --> 01:15:41.520
Caption: reading that the url is strawpoll.live

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:43.600
Caption: and the pin number is 602 156

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:45.679
Caption: so um as soon as we get a clear result

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.560
Caption: on the poll we&#39;ll uh we&#39;ll call it and

01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:48.560
Caption: we&#39;ll go down that path

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:54.080
Caption: and we won&#39;t be waiting for absolutely

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.679
Caption: everyone to vote unfortunately as soon

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:58.399
Caption: as we have a clear winner we&#39;ll go ahead

01:15:55.679 --> 01:15:59.920
Caption: just in the interest of time

01:15:58.399 --> 01:16:02.158
Caption: just trying to see if anyone&#39;s phones

01:15:59.919 --> 01:16:03.678
Caption: are still up we&#39;ll go across we&#39;ll look

01:16:02.159 --> 01:16:06.400
Caption: at the results

01:16:03.679 --> 01:16:08.719
Caption: oh

01:16:06.399 --> 01:16:10.238
Caption: no internet

01:16:08.719 --> 01:16:14.360
Caption: minor problem

01:16:10.238 --> 01:16:14.359
Caption: that explains the vpn issue

01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:24.560
Caption: no wonder i needed to use the the video

01:16:22.159 --> 01:16:24.560
Caption: back up

01:16:25.679 --> 01:16:29.280
Caption: all right looks like yeah it looks like

01:16:27.679 --> 01:16:32.479
Caption: mass assignment is a is a pretty clear

01:16:29.279 --> 01:16:34.718
Caption: winner so uh let&#39;s go down that path um

01:16:32.479 --> 01:16:36.879
Caption: all right i&#39;ll uh well hopefully while

01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:38.880
Caption: that&#39;s reconnecting

01:16:36.879 --> 01:16:41.198
Caption: it requires a password

01:16:38.879 --> 01:16:41.198
Caption: all right

01:16:44.719 --> 01:16:49.440
Caption: i&#39;m just going to go ahead with the

01:16:46.879 --> 01:16:51.279
Caption: video

01:16:49.439 --> 01:16:52.560
Caption: all right so here we are

01:16:51.279 --> 01:16:54.238
Caption: um

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.839
Caption: the page that catches our eye as far as

01:16:54.238 --> 01:16:57.678
Caption: potential mass assignment vulnerability

01:16:55.839 --> 01:16:59.520
Caption: is the profile page so we can update

01:16:57.679 --> 01:17:01.199
Caption: some of the user&#39;s details

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.879
Caption: um so we&#39;re just going to turn on this

01:17:01.199 --> 01:17:04.400
Caption: tool called burp suite

01:17:02.879 --> 01:17:06.000
Caption: which is going to let us intercept

01:17:04.399 --> 01:17:07.439
Caption: requests and actually see what&#39;s

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.679
Caption: happening behind the scenes when we do

01:17:07.439 --> 01:17:09.678
Caption: this

01:17:11.759 --> 01:17:15.599
Caption: right so just for a simple explanation

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.439
Caption: of how this works normally your browser

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:19.840
Caption: will send web requests directly to the

01:17:17.439 --> 01:17:21.678
Caption: backend api um we&#39;re turning on a tool

01:17:19.839 --> 01:17:23.040
Caption: called burp suite which kind of proxies

01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:24.880
Caption: that

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.799
Caption: takes requests intercepts them allows

01:17:24.879 --> 01:17:28.639
Caption: you to tamper with them or repeat them

01:17:26.799 --> 01:17:31.040
Caption: and forwards them onto the api so

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.560
Caption: that&#39;ll just give us some means of kind

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:35.280
Caption: of messing with these requests and

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.280
Caption: seeing what we can do

01:17:37.199 --> 01:17:40.080
Caption: right so ignore this first request

01:17:38.879 --> 01:17:43.279
Caption: because you can see it&#39;s just an options

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.120
Caption: request just required um for calls to

01:17:43.279 --> 01:17:46.959
Caption: work um this is the one that we&#39;re

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:48.800
Caption: interested in uh this is the one where

01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:50.640
Caption: you can see all of the data that we

01:17:48.799 --> 01:17:53.119
Caption: entered into the um

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:55.120
Caption: into the profile form has gone through

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.800
Caption: and we&#39;re just gonna send it to repeater

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:58.479
Caption: um which will let us kind of duplicate

01:17:56.799 --> 01:18:00.079
Caption: this request later

01:17:58.479 --> 01:18:02.399
Caption: and we can see in what comes back here

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:06.080
Caption: that we&#39;ve got the complete uh set of

01:18:02.399 --> 01:18:06.080
Caption: user claims including their role

01:18:07.279 --> 01:18:11.039
Caption: but note that all we sent in that

01:18:08.959 --> 01:18:12.560
Caption: request was just the details that we

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.919
Caption: were allowed to update

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:16.000
Caption: so now we&#39;re going to try to tamper with

01:18:13.919 --> 01:18:17.600
Caption: this

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.439
Caption: in particular we&#39;re going to add a role

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.879
Caption: field and we&#39;re going to put admin in

01:18:19.439 --> 01:18:25.718
Caption: there and we&#39;re just going to see if

01:18:20.879 --> 01:18:25.718
Caption: that succeeds and what happens

01:18:27.759 --> 01:18:32.639
Caption: we got a 200 response so uh

01:18:30.479 --> 01:18:34.560
Caption: it succeeded in sending the request and

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:36.479
Caption: we can see that the role field says

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:38.839
Caption: admin now so that&#39;s a good indicator

01:18:36.479 --> 01:18:41.679
Caption: that we&#39;ve probably succeeded

01:18:38.839 --> 01:18:43.678
Caption: um so the next thing we&#39;re going to do

01:18:41.679 --> 01:18:45.679
Caption: is just log out and back in because this

01:18:43.679 --> 01:18:47.520
Caption: website wasn&#39;t really designed

01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:50.080
Caption: most likely for a user to change their

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.799
Caption: raw mid session so just to avoid any

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.320
Caption: inconsistencies

01:18:52.799 --> 01:18:56.238
Caption: and make sure we refresh the session

01:18:54.319 --> 01:18:58.000
Caption: state all right now that we&#39;re here we

01:18:56.238 --> 01:19:00.079
Caption: can see immediately that we have a new

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.759
Caption: menu that we didn&#39;t have before and it

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:05.159
Caption: includes this ad product page which we

01:19:01.759 --> 01:19:05.158
Caption: can now access

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.959
Caption: so we are now in

01:19:14.238 --> 01:19:17.678
Caption: all right so time to reflect a little

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.879
Caption: bit on what the developer did right and

01:19:17.679 --> 01:19:21.840
Caption: wrong here

01:19:18.879 --> 01:19:23.600
Caption: um so what&#39;s actually happened is that

01:19:21.839 --> 01:19:24.879
Caption: they&#39;ve intended to

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:26.560
Caption: send these

01:19:24.879 --> 01:19:29.198
Caption: details that are allowed to be updated

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.959
Caption: email first name and last name and

01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:33.440
Caption: superimpose them on the existing user

01:19:30.959 --> 01:19:36.640
Caption: record and store that in the database

01:19:33.439 --> 01:19:38.319
Caption: when we included an extra field role

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:39.760
Caption: there was nothing in the api that

01:19:38.319 --> 01:19:41.678
Caption: validated that and there was nothing

01:19:39.759 --> 01:19:43.119
Caption: that stopped it from being superimposed

01:19:41.679 --> 01:19:46.080
Caption: on top of the user record and being

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.399
Caption: stored so we just accepted it saved it

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:50.560
Caption: and we became an admin

01:19:48.399 --> 01:19:52.959
Caption: right so what they should have done is

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:54.719
Caption: allow listed user input explicitly so

01:19:52.959 --> 01:19:56.718
Caption: you only allow the fields that should be

01:19:54.719 --> 01:19:59.600
Caption: updated by that endpoint in this case

01:19:56.719 --> 01:20:01.520
Caption: email first name and surname

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:03.520
Caption: um another thing they could have done is

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:06.399
Caption: just to not use local accounts at all

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:08.239
Caption: it&#39;s very difficult to implement good

01:20:06.399 --> 01:20:10.479
Caption: user account management there&#39;s a lot of

01:20:08.238 --> 01:20:12.799
Caption: issues that kind of come into play using

01:20:10.479 --> 01:20:16.000
Caption: a third-party service like

01:20:12.799 --> 01:20:17.919
Caption: azure ad or cognito or auth0 something

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.159
Caption: like that will solve a lot of those

01:20:17.919 --> 01:20:22.238
Caption: problems for you

01:20:20.159 --> 01:20:23.920
Caption: um and also just a note on this um a

01:20:22.238 --> 01:20:26.639
Caption: couple of popular javascript frameworks

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:30.479
Caption: are vulnerable to this out of the box so

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:32.959
Caption: nest js and um fastify both will by

01:20:30.479 --> 01:20:35.199
Caption: default not validate input fields and

01:20:32.959 --> 01:20:36.959
Caption: we&#39;ll just kind of deserialize whatever

01:20:35.199 --> 01:20:38.880
Caption: you send it and

01:20:36.959 --> 01:20:41.679
Caption: if you don&#39;t check for that explicitly

01:20:38.879 --> 01:20:41.678
Caption: they will save it

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:47.678
Caption: all right so now james is going to hop

01:20:45.919 --> 01:20:50.238
Caption: on the keyboard i&#39;ve tethered so

01:20:47.679 --> 01:20:52.159
Caption: hopefully we&#39;ve got internet if i just

01:20:50.238 --> 01:20:54.959
Caption: refresh github yeah okay we&#39;ve got

01:20:52.159 --> 01:20:58.159
Caption: internet we can resume the live demo

01:20:54.959 --> 01:21:00.319
Caption: uh i guess just log in as the admin user

01:20:58.159 --> 01:21:01.760
Caption: so now james is going to explore what

01:21:00.319 --> 01:21:04.959
Caption: permissions we&#39;ve got now that we&#39;re

01:21:01.759 --> 01:21:06.158
Caption: admin and we&#39;ll i showed briefly uh what

01:21:04.959 --> 01:21:08.000
Caption: was there

01:21:06.159 --> 01:21:12.080
Caption: in the um

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.080
Caption: i might have to restart the vpn yeah

01:21:12.799 --> 01:21:15.839
Caption: do you remember my password

01:21:18.719 --> 01:21:21.440
Caption: all right

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:26.120
Caption: give that a go

01:21:21.439 --> 01:21:26.120
Caption: if not we&#39;ve still got the video backups

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:34.239
Caption: you might have to refresh this to get

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.239
Caption: the the login working again

01:21:34.279 --> 01:21:39.538
Caption: [Music]

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.919
Caption: all right we&#39;re in his admin as as we

01:21:43.679 --> 01:21:46.880
Caption: were before okay we so we&#39;ve got this

01:21:45.919 --> 01:21:49.120
Caption: admin

01:21:46.879 --> 01:21:50.399
Caption: uh menu that we&#39;ve gained access to and

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:52.639
Caption: there&#39;s a number of different buttons on

01:21:50.399 --> 01:21:54.000
Caption: there so we&#39;ve got these server logs it

01:21:52.639 --> 01:21:56.239
Caption: the feature is clearly a work in

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.719
Caption: progress with some some sample logs in

01:21:56.238 --> 01:22:00.559
Caption: there not quite finished we&#39;ve got some

01:21:58.719 --> 01:22:02.239
Caption: notes that we can access these are

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:03.439
Caption: developer notes with a bunch of to-do

01:22:02.238 --> 01:22:05.759
Caption: list items

01:22:03.439 --> 01:22:07.520
Caption: so the developers mentioned that there&#39;s

01:22:05.759 --> 01:22:09.599
Caption: an ad product feature that shouldn&#39;t be

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:11.279
Caption: using eval for parsing some of you might

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:13.040
Caption: recognize that as a

01:22:11.279 --> 01:22:14.879
Caption: interesting thing

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:16.560
Caption: add drop down to the logs page to view

01:22:14.879 --> 01:22:18.638
Caption: different log files instead of query

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:21.520
Caption: parameters that&#39;s another interesting

01:22:18.639 --> 01:22:23.760
Caption: one for us stop using the api as an api

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.279
Caption: host as a jump box remove unnecessary

01:22:23.759 --> 01:22:26.479
Caption: privileges

01:22:25.279 --> 01:22:27.839
Caption: implement a couple of features so

01:22:26.479 --> 01:22:29.839
Caption: there&#39;s a bunch of cleanup that the

01:22:27.839 --> 01:22:32.238
Caption: developers left themselves clearly a

01:22:29.839 --> 01:22:34.399
Caption: working product at work in progress

01:22:32.238 --> 01:22:36.479
Caption: website we&#39;ve got the ad product feature

01:22:34.399 --> 01:22:39.198
Caption: which we mentioned earlier that we were

01:22:36.479 --> 01:22:41.199
Caption: interested in uh so from this page it

01:22:39.199 --> 01:22:44.560
Caption: seems like uh you can add a new product

01:22:41.199 --> 01:22:46.719
Caption: to the to the page

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.719
Caption: to the website

01:22:46.719 --> 01:22:53.080
Caption: if we&#39;re having trouble

01:22:48.719 --> 01:22:53.080
Caption: it&#39;s still tethered no okay

01:23:02.639 --> 01:23:06.719
Caption: and we&#39;ve got ad image to gallery which

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:08.238
Caption: is still under construction

01:23:06.719 --> 01:23:10.159
Caption: so that seems to be the extent there&#39;s

01:23:08.238 --> 01:23:12.158
Caption: no there&#39;s nothing else obvious that the

01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:14.639
Caption: admin seems to have access to so let&#39;s

01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:17.199
Caption: discuss some of the options that we see

01:23:14.639 --> 01:23:17.199
Caption: ahead of us

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:20.719
Caption: uh yes

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:22.080
Caption: we&#39;re we&#39;re an admin and we&#39;ve gained

01:23:20.719 --> 01:23:24.000
Caption: access to all this but we want to go

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.280
Caption: deeper we want to get onto the actual

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.399
Caption: host machine

01:23:25.279 --> 01:23:28.158
Caption: so how we&#39;re going to do that we&#39;ve got

01:23:26.399 --> 01:23:30.000
Caption: a couple of different options

01:23:28.159 --> 01:23:32.800
Caption: number one is information disclosure

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.799
Caption: this one&#39;s relatively self-explanatory

01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:36.399
Caption: it means the website discloses

01:23:34.799 --> 01:23:37.198
Caption: information that it otherwise shouldn&#39;t

01:23:36.399 --> 01:23:38.718
Caption: so

01:23:37.199 --> 01:23:40.000
Caption: in this case we&#39;re looking at the server

01:23:38.719 --> 01:23:42.080
Caption: logs feature and we&#39;re going to see if

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.439
Caption: we can manipulate that into providing us

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:45.280
Caption: with information

01:23:43.439 --> 01:23:47.839
Caption: that it otherwise shouldn&#39;t be normally

01:23:45.279 --> 01:23:49.839
Caption: it should only give us access to logs

01:23:47.839 --> 01:23:52.000
Caption: the developer mentioned that there&#39;s

01:23:49.839 --> 01:23:54.638
Caption: some work still to be done on this page

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.238
Caption: so we&#39;ll see if we can manipulate that

01:23:54.639 --> 01:23:58.560
Caption: to uncover more information which will

01:23:56.238 --> 01:24:00.559
Caption: help us get onto the box next up is

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:02.959
Caption: remote code execution this one&#39;s a

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:04.719
Caption: pretty severe one to have on your site

01:24:02.959 --> 01:24:05.759
Caption: if it does come up

01:24:04.719 --> 01:24:07.840
Caption: uh

01:24:05.759 --> 01:24:09.039
Caption: everyone probably has heard of vlog for

01:24:07.839 --> 01:24:10.718
Caption: shell

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:12.879
Caption: late last year early this year yeah

01:24:10.719 --> 01:24:14.000
Caption: caused quite a panic lots of frantic

01:24:12.879 --> 01:24:15.520
Caption: patching

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.120
Caption: that was an example of remote code

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:19.439
Caption: execution there&#39;s a number of different

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.360
Caption: ways that remote code execution can come

01:24:19.439 --> 01:24:23.520
Caption: up but a very common theme is

01:24:21.359 --> 01:24:25.759
Caption: deserialization

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:28.080
Caption: in that case an attacker can craft a

01:24:25.759 --> 01:24:30.879
Caption: specially crafted payload

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:33.600
Caption: so maybe a profile profile picture with

01:24:30.879 --> 01:24:36.560
Caption: some code in it that&#39;s not really a jpeg

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:38.320
Caption: they provide that to the target

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:40.959
Caption: and when the target goes to read that

01:24:38.319 --> 01:24:43.520
Caption: data you the attacker will

01:24:40.959 --> 01:24:46.879
Caption: has crafted a payload that&#39;s exploiting

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:49.199
Caption: the way that it reads that data to then

01:24:46.879 --> 01:24:52.000
Caption: get it to do whatever it wants

01:24:49.199 --> 01:24:52.000
Caption: potentially die

01:24:52.399 --> 01:24:55.839
Caption: in this case we&#39;ll be looking at the add

01:24:53.919 --> 01:24:57.439
Caption: product feature to see if we can

01:24:55.839 --> 01:24:59.040
Caption: manipulate it based on the developer

01:24:57.439 --> 01:25:01.839
Caption: notes they mentioned they&#39;re using eval

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:03.040
Caption: for parsing the the input from the from

01:25:01.839 --> 01:25:04.718
Caption: the user

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:06.560
Caption: so we&#39;ll have a look and see if we can

01:25:04.719 --> 01:25:08.000
Caption: manipulate that to run whatever code

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:10.239
Caption: we&#39;d like

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.040
Caption: so once again we have come to a decision

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:15.039
Caption: point

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:15.040
Caption: vote on your phones for whichever option

01:25:16.719 --> 01:25:20.800
Caption: so for those at the back the code is

01:25:18.238 --> 01:25:23.198
Caption: 169648

01:25:20.799 --> 01:25:25.520
Caption: if you need it

01:25:23.199 --> 01:25:29.280
Caption: we&#39;ll give it a minute for

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:29.279
Caption: people to have the url loaded up

01:25:33.199 --> 01:25:36.080
Caption: all right

01:25:34.238 --> 01:25:37.359
Caption: hopefully the results should be off on

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.679
Caption: the other side

01:25:37.359 --> 01:25:41.119
Caption: if we&#39;re tethered we should be able to

01:25:39.679 --> 01:25:43.360
Caption: actually see the results ourselves this

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.360
Caption: time

01:25:45.199 --> 01:25:49.920
Caption: all right looks like a pretty clear win

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:51.840
Caption: for remote code execution

01:25:49.919 --> 01:25:55.839
Caption: thanks for all your votes

01:25:51.839 --> 01:25:55.839
Caption: we&#39;ll proceed with that option live now

01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:01.280
Caption: all right so james is now going to do do

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.959
Caption: a demo of this hopefully we can do it

01:26:01.279 --> 01:26:04.399
Caption: live and not use the video recording so

01:26:02.959 --> 01:26:06.000
Caption: james is now navigating to the add

01:26:04.399 --> 01:26:09.040
Caption: product feature

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.799
Caption: and he&#39;s turning on burp again which we

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:13.520
Caption: saw in the previous

01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:13.520
Caption: previous layer

01:26:14.479 --> 01:26:18.560
Caption: and james is just going to enter some

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:21.560
Caption: data into this form it doesn&#39;t really

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:21.560
Caption: matter

01:26:22.639 --> 01:26:25.679
Caption: and he&#39;s going to submit

01:26:25.759 --> 01:26:30.000
Caption: oh yeah

01:26:26.799 --> 01:26:30.000
Caption: turn the vpn back on

01:26:30.159 --> 01:26:33.920
Caption: and submit

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:35.919
Caption: and now we can see the request has been

01:26:33.919 --> 01:26:37.040
Caption: intercepted by burp again we&#39;ve got this

01:26:35.919 --> 01:26:39.839
Caption: options request which we&#39;re not

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.319
Caption: interested in we go ahead to the post

01:26:39.839 --> 01:26:44.319
Caption: request and james is now sending that to

01:26:42.319 --> 01:26:47.198
Caption: repeater for us to

01:26:44.319 --> 01:26:48.799
Caption: repeat the request

01:26:47.199 --> 01:26:50.960
Caption: so now if jane scrolls down in the

01:26:48.799 --> 01:26:54.079
Caption: request we can see the actual payload

01:26:50.959 --> 01:26:56.560
Caption: that he submitted in the form

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:58.800
Caption: and what he&#39;s going to do now is he&#39;s

01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.080
Caption: going to update that payload to

01:26:58.799 --> 01:27:01.919
Caption: something else we&#39;re going to try and

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:04.239
Caption: see if we can get remote code execution

01:27:01.919 --> 01:27:07.359
Caption: so he&#39;s just put in just a string there

01:27:04.238 --> 01:27:11.198
Caption: see what we get back out of the api

01:27:07.359 --> 01:27:13.198
Caption: we get a 500 internal server error

01:27:11.199 --> 01:27:15.840
Caption: unexpected identifier okay

01:27:13.199 --> 01:27:18.000
Caption: not particularly helpful to us

01:27:15.839 --> 01:27:19.119
Caption: now james is going to do a random shot

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.600
Caption: in the dark

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:22.879
Caption: see have a look if uh you&#39;re missing the

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:24.560
Caption: one yep

01:27:22.879 --> 01:27:25.678
Caption: we&#39;re just going to see if one equals

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.800
Caption: equals one

01:27:25.679 --> 01:27:31.199
Caption: if we get any sort of uh

01:27:28.799 --> 01:27:34.479
Caption: parsing of that input and returning as

01:27:31.199 --> 01:27:35.520
Caption: true so we get a 200 okay from the api

01:27:34.479 --> 01:27:37.040
Caption: and

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.719
Caption: okay maybe the error codes could use

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:40.959
Caption: some work it says parsed input could not

01:27:38.719 --> 01:27:43.920
Caption: be read correctly with the

01:27:40.959 --> 01:27:45.839
Caption: additional information being true

01:27:43.919 --> 01:27:48.000
Caption: that us hints that we&#39;ve got some sort

01:27:45.839 --> 01:27:49.759
Caption: of remote code execution because the one

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.040
Caption: equals equals one

01:27:49.759 --> 01:27:54.879
Caption: has has been evaluated as true

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:56.719
Caption: instead of maybe just being interpreted

01:27:54.879 --> 01:27:58.879
Caption: as a string

01:27:56.719 --> 01:28:01.040
Caption: so now what james is going to do is try

01:27:58.879 --> 01:28:03.520
Caption: and identify what we&#39;re working with

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.520
Caption: here if you if you google eval

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:08.000
Caption: the top two results are javascript and

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:10.159
Caption: python so james is just going to try a

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.479
Caption: quick javascript

01:28:10.159 --> 01:28:14.880
Caption: command here and see if we get a

01:28:12.479 --> 01:28:18.879
Caption: response back

01:28:14.879 --> 01:28:20.399
Caption: so we get a 200 okay and we now have

01:28:18.879 --> 01:28:22.799
Caption: what appears to be the current working

01:28:20.399 --> 01:28:24.479
Caption: directory of the running process

01:28:22.799 --> 01:28:25.439
Caption: uh hopefully everyone can see that but

01:28:24.479 --> 01:28:28.000
Caption: it says

01:28:25.439 --> 01:28:29.279
Caption: basically we see what looks like a

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.639
Caption: folder path

01:28:29.279 --> 01:28:32.479
Caption: there

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:33.840
Caption: so now that we&#39;ve identified that we&#39;re

01:28:32.479 --> 01:28:35.600
Caption: working with javascript and we&#39;ve got

01:28:33.839 --> 01:28:38.238
Caption: remote code execution

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.679
Caption: the rest is relatively simple you can go

01:28:38.238 --> 01:28:42.319
Caption: by a

01:28:39.679 --> 01:28:44.719
Caption: playbook so what james is doing now is

01:28:42.319 --> 01:28:47.040
Caption: installing a tool called netcat this is

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:49.199
Caption: a tool that we&#39;ll be using to

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:52.080
Caption: set up a remote shell we&#39;re using the

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:53.840
Caption: yum package manager here assuming that

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:56.719
Caption: we&#39;re working with an ec2 instance

01:28:53.839 --> 01:28:58.399
Caption: because the front end was s3 it&#39;s a

01:28:56.719 --> 01:29:00.639
Caption: relatively safe assumption that the back

01:28:58.399 --> 01:29:03.040
Caption: end is ec2 which

01:29:00.639 --> 01:29:05.040
Caption: allows us to use yum

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:06.799
Caption: in this case we&#39;ve we&#39;re using a child

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:08.239
Caption: process to run the command so we&#39;re not

01:29:06.799 --> 01:29:10.959
Caption: actually getting any

01:29:08.238 --> 01:29:12.799
Caption: immediate um response back

01:29:10.959 --> 01:29:14.639
Caption: so at this stage we&#39;re working a little

01:29:12.799 --> 01:29:17.759
Caption: bit blind this is a very common theme

01:29:14.639 --> 01:29:20.239
Caption: for these sorts of things is you will

01:29:17.759 --> 01:29:22.319
Caption: set something up and assume that that

01:29:20.238 --> 01:29:23.198
Caption: has worked when you go on to your next

01:29:22.319 --> 01:29:24.799
Caption: step

01:29:23.199 --> 01:29:27.120
Caption: and you&#39;ll find out at the next step if

01:29:24.799 --> 01:29:29.359
Caption: it actually worked correctly

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:32.399
Caption: what james is now setting up is using

01:29:29.359 --> 01:29:35.359
Caption: netcat which we just installed to set up

01:29:32.399 --> 01:29:37.040
Caption: a bind shell listening on port 8181

01:29:35.359 --> 01:29:39.198
Caption: we&#39;ll explain more about these reverse

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:41.359
Caption: shells and bind shells in a second

01:29:39.199 --> 01:29:42.800
Caption: again we don&#39;t get any immediate

01:29:41.359 --> 01:29:44.560
Caption: response back

01:29:42.799 --> 01:29:46.000
Caption: because this is working through a child

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:47.600
Caption: process we&#39;re just going to have to

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.359
Caption: assume that it&#39;s worked and we&#39;re now

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:52.399
Caption: going to try and connect to the target

01:29:51.359 --> 01:29:56.479
Caption: uh

01:29:52.399 --> 01:29:58.319
Caption: yeah in a new tab james is now going to

01:29:56.479 --> 01:30:00.879
Caption: run that and we don&#39;t get any immediate

01:29:58.319 --> 01:30:03.279
Caption: response but if james runs who am i it

01:30:00.879 --> 01:30:06.319
Caption: seems we&#39;re root on the target we&#39;re in

01:30:03.279 --> 01:30:08.959
Caption: the in the folder that we saw earlier

01:30:06.319 --> 01:30:10.638
Caption: and we&#39;ve got access to the files there

01:30:08.959 --> 01:30:12.080
Caption: so it looks like we&#39;re on the actual

01:30:10.639 --> 01:30:13.439
Caption: target james is now just going to

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:15.439
Caption: upgrade our shell to something a little

01:30:13.439 --> 01:30:19.279
Caption: bit nicer

01:30:15.439 --> 01:30:22.080
Caption: there we go so we&#39;re root on 10.00.10

01:30:19.279 --> 01:30:24.799
Caption: and we&#39;re in the in the folder now you

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:27.839
Caption: can see there so we&#39;re in we&#39;re in as a

01:30:24.799 --> 01:30:27.839
Caption: on the host machine now

01:30:28.399 --> 01:30:32.718
Caption: we can skip straight to remote shells

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.439
Caption: yep so what we&#39;ve set up currently is a

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:38.800
Caption: bind shell uh in the commands that james

01:30:35.439 --> 01:30:41.279
Caption: run he ran he set up netcat and he

01:30:38.799 --> 01:30:44.158
Caption: configured it on the target to listen

01:30:41.279 --> 01:30:45.759
Caption: for an incoming connection on port 8181

01:30:44.159 --> 01:30:48.560
Caption: and then the attacker

01:30:45.759 --> 01:30:51.039
Caption: that&#39;s uh my laptop here connects

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:53.359
Caption: directly to that ip address on that port

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:55.199
Caption: and now we have a connection the inverse

01:30:53.359 --> 01:30:57.678
Caption: of this is a reverse shell where you set

01:30:55.199 --> 01:31:00.000
Caption: up the attacker to listen so i would set

01:30:57.679 --> 01:31:02.719
Caption: up a process on the laptop to listen and

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.959
Caption: then get the actual target to reach back

01:31:02.719 --> 01:31:07.440
Caption: out to me this is much more common in

01:31:04.959 --> 01:31:08.879
Caption: practice because you it doesn&#39;t require

01:31:07.439 --> 01:31:10.319
Caption: nearly as much knowledge about the

01:31:08.879 --> 01:31:11.759
Caption: target you don&#39;t need to know the ip

01:31:10.319 --> 01:31:13.198
Caption: address of your target for it to reach

01:31:11.759 --> 01:31:14.879
Caption: out to you just has to have internet

01:31:13.199 --> 01:31:18.000
Caption: connectivity

01:31:14.879 --> 01:31:21.279
Caption: you don&#39;t need to have a port available

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.719
Caption: on the target to bind to because you&#39;re

01:31:21.279 --> 01:31:23.839
Caption: you&#39;re only listening on your actual

01:31:22.719 --> 01:31:25.840
Caption: attacker

01:31:23.839 --> 01:31:27.359
Caption: either way the end result is the same we

01:31:25.839 --> 01:31:29.359
Caption: have a connection between the attacker

01:31:27.359 --> 01:31:31.520
Caption: and the target and we as the attacker

01:31:29.359 --> 01:31:34.080
Caption: can tell the target to do whatever we

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:34.080
Caption: want it to do

01:31:35.279 --> 01:31:39.919
Caption: now onto eval let&#39;s reflect a little bit

01:31:37.919 --> 01:31:41.520
Caption: on what the developer was doing here we

01:31:39.919 --> 01:31:44.560
Caption: don&#39;t have access to the code but we can

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:46.159
Caption: more or less guess that they they knew

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:48.000
Caption: this was wrong because they left

01:31:46.159 --> 01:31:49.679
Caption: themselves a note to remove the use of

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:51.199
Caption: eval

01:31:49.679 --> 01:31:53.679
Caption: but they also

01:31:51.199 --> 01:31:56.000
Caption: had this hidden behind the the admin

01:31:53.679 --> 01:31:58.320
Caption: role they were the admin of the website

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.080
Caption: probably and only admins could access

01:31:58.319 --> 01:32:01.759
Caption: this feature so why

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:04.879
Caption: worry about locking it down it&#39;s not

01:32:01.759 --> 01:32:04.879
Caption: customer facing anyway

01:32:05.199 --> 01:32:09.440
Caption: however yes they did know it was wrong

01:32:07.279 --> 01:32:11.359
Caption: if you google eval javascript the top

01:32:09.439 --> 01:32:14.319
Caption: five results are all various warnings

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:17.198
Caption: about not using eval so don&#39;t do what

01:32:14.319 --> 01:32:19.599
Caption: this developer did

01:32:17.199 --> 01:32:22.639
Caption: yep never use eval

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.959
Caption: you should instead use a json parsing

01:32:22.639 --> 01:32:26.719
Caption: library to pass json under the hood

01:32:24.959 --> 01:32:28.879
Caption: probably a lot of them do end up using

01:32:26.719 --> 01:32:30.960
Caption: eval at some point but they do all sorts

01:32:28.879 --> 01:32:33.198
Caption: of validation and make sure that you&#39;re

01:32:30.959 --> 01:32:36.319
Caption: not giving it anything nasty

01:32:33.199 --> 01:32:36.320
Caption: before just running code

01:32:36.879 --> 01:32:40.238
Caption: so that&#39;s it for that layer of the demo

01:32:38.719 --> 01:32:42.800
Caption: i&#39;m now going to hop back on the

01:32:40.238 --> 01:32:44.559
Caption: keyboard and james is going to narrate

01:32:42.799 --> 01:32:46.000
Caption: while i explore our new found

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:48.800
Caption: permissions

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.399
Caption: yeah right so we&#39;re now on the host

01:32:48.799 --> 01:32:52.479
Caption: it&#39;s an ec2 instance so we&#39;re actually

01:32:50.399 --> 01:32:54.080
Caption: on aws infrastructure

01:32:52.479 --> 01:32:57.520
Caption: so the natural next step for us is going

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:59.839
Caption: to be to um try to see what um stuff we

01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:02.479
Caption: can get to in the aws account

01:32:59.839 --> 01:33:04.560
Caption: um so one natural target would be

01:33:02.479 --> 01:33:06.319
Caption: querying secrets manager for secrets

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:09.439
Caption: that are available and seeing if we can

01:33:06.319 --> 01:33:12.560
Caption: read any so this is a aws cli command

01:33:09.439 --> 01:33:12.560
Caption: that&#39;s going to do exactly that

01:33:12.639 --> 01:33:16.080
Caption: um so we can see a list of secrets that

01:33:14.719 --> 01:33:18.800
Caption: have been returned so that means we have

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:20.239
Caption: the list secrets permission doesn&#39;t

01:33:18.799 --> 01:33:21.678
Caption: guarantee that we have permission to

01:33:20.238 --> 01:33:23.759
Caption: read it

01:33:21.679 --> 01:33:25.840
Caption: so there&#39;s a secret here that clearly

01:33:23.759 --> 01:33:29.439
Caption: catches our eyes super duper top secret

01:33:25.839 --> 01:33:29.439
Caption: so let&#39;s see if we can read that

01:33:33.439 --> 01:33:36.879
Caption: right so this is the cli command that we

01:33:35.199 --> 01:33:40.159
Caption: need to use to actually query the

01:33:36.879 --> 01:33:40.158
Caption: contents of that secret

01:33:40.799 --> 01:33:45.599
Caption: and we get an access denied exception um

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:47.279
Caption: so that is an aws iom error that tells

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:50.439
Caption: us that we&#39;re not authorized to access

01:33:47.279 --> 01:33:50.439
Caption: that resource

01:33:51.679 --> 01:33:55.280
Caption: so next thing we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re

01:33:53.199 --> 01:33:56.960
Caption: going to do a little bit of recon we&#39;re

01:33:55.279 --> 01:33:58.799
Caption: going to try to figure out what

01:33:56.959 --> 01:34:00.399
Caption: permissions we do have and see if

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:01.520
Caption: there&#39;s a way we can escalate our

01:34:00.399 --> 01:34:03.839
Caption: privileges

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:05.439
Caption: so james is just querying the metadata

01:34:03.839 --> 01:34:07.198
Caption: endpoint that the ec2 instance has

01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:09.919
Caption: access to to find out the name of the

01:34:07.199 --> 01:34:11.199
Caption: role that it&#39;s using

01:34:09.919 --> 01:34:13.839
Caption: and then

01:34:11.199 --> 01:34:15.520
Caption: attached to an ir role in aws can be one

01:34:13.839 --> 01:34:17.359
Caption: or more policies which are documents

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:19.520
Caption: that define permissions so now we&#39;re

01:34:17.359 --> 01:34:21.119
Caption: going to look at the role policies that

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:23.679
Caption: are attached to that role and we can

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:25.120
Caption: only see one

01:34:23.679 --> 01:34:28.400
Caption: so now the next thing we&#39;re going to do

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:29.600
Caption: is actually query the policy document um

01:34:28.399 --> 01:34:33.560
Caption: that that role

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.560
Caption: that that policy contains

01:34:34.399 --> 01:34:37.919
Caption: and we can see a whole bunch of

01:34:36.159 --> 01:34:39.760
Caption: permissions here

01:34:37.919 --> 01:34:41.839
Caption: when we scroll up we can see that we do

01:34:39.759 --> 01:34:43.519
Caption: have the secrets manager get secret

01:34:41.839 --> 01:34:45.759
Caption: value permission

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:48.399
Caption: assigned to us but it&#39;s scoped to these

01:34:45.759 --> 01:34:51.198
Caption: resources that um that have these arn

01:34:48.399 --> 01:34:54.080
Caption: prefixes um and our super duper top

01:34:51.199 --> 01:34:56.479
Caption: secret is not among that list

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:59.600
Caption: um we do however have a big list of

01:34:56.479 --> 01:35:01.359
Caption: permissions here um that we do have ec2

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.080
Caption: run instances is one that catches our

01:35:01.359 --> 01:35:05.600
Caption: eye as is create policy version

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.479
Caption: um and if you scroll down a little bit

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.560
Caption: more

01:35:06.479 --> 01:35:11.040
Caption: i am pass roll

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:13.919
Caption: um and if we keep scrolling we can see

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:17.280
Caption: as well that um the resource section of

01:35:13.919 --> 01:35:18.959
Caption: that um is a wild card so we can execute

01:35:17.279 --> 01:35:21.279
Caption: these permissions on any resource in the

01:35:18.959 --> 01:35:21.279
Caption: account

01:35:22.479 --> 01:35:25.359
Caption: all right so

01:35:23.759 --> 01:35:28.238
Caption: that gives us our third goal which is to

01:35:25.359 --> 01:35:29.919
Caption: start exfol trading secrets um so we

01:35:28.238 --> 01:35:32.000
Caption: want to get this super duper top secret

01:35:29.919 --> 01:35:33.600
Caption: first role to do that or first option to

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Caption: do that is to use the past role

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:38.239
Caption: permission um so the purpose of this is

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.919
Caption: that it allows one resource to pass a

01:35:38.238 --> 01:35:41.919
Caption: role to another so say you&#39;re

01:35:39.919 --> 01:35:43.600
Caption: provisioning an ec2 instance

01:35:41.919 --> 01:35:45.520
Caption: you can give it a role

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.359
Caption: and then if we were to leverage that we

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:49.199
Caption: could then connect into that ec2

01:35:47.359 --> 01:35:50.879
Caption: instance via ssh

01:35:49.199 --> 01:35:53.600
Caption: and then as we&#39;re doing currently with

01:35:50.879 --> 01:35:54.839
Caption: the api host we can just use the

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:57.600
Caption: role that it has

01:35:54.839 --> 01:36:00.000
Caption: available second option is create policy

01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:02.189
Caption: version uh despite the name this is just

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.520
Caption: an update policy um

01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:05.520
Caption: [Music]

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:07.520
Caption: permission so what it allows us to do is

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:09.679
Caption: create a new version of a policy so at

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:11.520
Caption: the moment if we query secrets manager

01:36:09.679 --> 01:36:13.360
Caption: uh we get an access denied error because

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:15.600
Caption: we don&#39;t have the permission to access

01:36:13.359 --> 01:36:17.520
Caption: it but what we can do based on what

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:20.159
Caption: we&#39;ve found is we can just update that

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.000
Caption: policy to allow us to do it

01:36:20.159 --> 01:36:25.800
Caption: and then next time we try to query it we

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.799
Caption: should be able to do that

01:36:25.839 --> 01:36:28.959
Caption: all right so time to vote um once again

01:36:27.839 --> 01:36:32.238
Caption: if you&#39;re at the back of the room the

01:36:28.959 --> 01:36:33.600
Caption: code is 939765

01:36:32.238 --> 01:36:36.399
Caption: um and again we&#39;re just going to go

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:40.399
Caption: until we have an authoritative result

01:36:36.399 --> 01:36:40.399
Caption: not until every single vote it comes in

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:51.760
Caption: got one or two phones still up we&#39;ll

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.199
Caption: wait till

01:36:51.759 --> 01:36:56.638
Caption: all right

01:36:53.199 --> 01:36:56.639
Caption: have a look at the results

01:37:00.959 --> 01:37:06.080
Caption: oh this one&#39;s pretty tight oh boy

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.600
Caption: it&#39;s a dead head all right it kind of

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:10.399
Caption: looks like create policy version is

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:11.919
Caption: winning by a hair but we&#39;ll

01:37:10.399 --> 01:37:13.359
Caption: if anyone&#39;s still

01:37:11.919 --> 01:37:16.639
Caption: trying to vote

01:37:13.359 --> 01:37:17.919
Caption: is this it any tie breakers coming in

01:37:16.639 --> 01:37:19.760
Caption: all right all right i&#39;ll take the

01:37:17.919 --> 01:37:20.639
Caption: silences

01:37:19.759 --> 01:37:23.519
Caption: oh

01:37:20.639 --> 01:37:23.520
Caption: there&#39;s one close up

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:31.000
Caption: we&#39;ll give it five more seconds

01:37:34.399 --> 01:37:38.959
Caption: someone open up incognito on your on

01:37:36.639 --> 01:37:42.639
Caption: your browser and do a second vote

01:37:38.959 --> 01:37:42.639
Caption: it looks like create policy versions one

01:37:42.799 --> 01:37:45.279
Caption: only just that&#39;s the closest we&#39;ve seen

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:47.280
Caption: it

01:37:45.279 --> 01:37:49.919
Caption: all right so create policy version has

01:37:47.279 --> 01:37:52.158
Caption: it so let&#39;s go do that and see if we can

01:37:49.919 --> 01:37:53.759
Caption: get that secret

01:37:52.159 --> 01:37:55.760
Caption: all right so what we&#39;re going to do now

01:37:53.759 --> 01:37:57.599
Caption: is create a new version of the policy

01:37:55.759 --> 01:37:59.039
Caption: that&#39;s attached to our role so first

01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:01.199
Caption: thing we&#39;re going to do is go back to

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:02.639
Caption: that query that we used before to list

01:38:01.199 --> 01:38:03.520
Caption: the policies that are attached to the

01:38:02.639 --> 01:38:04.800
Caption: role

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:05.919
Caption: um

01:38:04.799 --> 01:38:07.439
Caption: so

01:38:05.919 --> 01:38:09.279
Caption: the name of the policy that we&#39;re after

01:38:07.439 --> 01:38:10.959
Caption: is simple policy it&#39;s the only one there

01:38:09.279 --> 01:38:13.118
Caption: and we&#39;ve got the arn of it there which

01:38:10.959 --> 01:38:14.479
Caption: we&#39;re going to need to make a command to

01:38:13.119 --> 01:38:16.880
Caption: update it

01:38:14.479 --> 01:38:19.119
Caption: right so this is one very big inline

01:38:16.879 --> 01:38:20.879
Caption: command that james is going to paste in

01:38:19.119 --> 01:38:22.080
Caption: that&#39;s going to do the update operation

01:38:20.879 --> 01:38:26.158
Caption: but

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:26.159
Caption: um i will talk to it piece by piece

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:31.760
Caption: right so

01:38:28.879 --> 01:38:33.759
Caption: first line of the thing there the first

01:38:31.759 --> 01:38:36.000
Caption: main argument is that arn that we just

01:38:33.759 --> 01:38:37.519
Caption: looked up which is the uh policy that

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.520
Caption: we&#39;re going to be updating

01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:41.040
Caption: um following that you can see the actual

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:44.080
Caption: policy document we&#39;ve just pasted it

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:46.000
Caption: there as inline json um most important

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:48.399
Caption: parts are this statement here that

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.238
Caption: contains the

01:38:48.399 --> 01:38:52.319
Caption: actions section that says secrets

01:38:50.238 --> 01:38:53.599
Caption: manager list secrets and secrets manager

01:38:52.319 --> 01:38:55.520
Caption: gets secret value so that&#39;s going to

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:57.280
Caption: allow us to get the secret value and

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.439
Caption: importantly we&#39;ve got a wild card for

01:38:57.279 --> 01:39:00.319
Caption: the resource section so this policy will

01:38:59.439 --> 01:39:02.399
Caption: have

01:39:00.319 --> 01:39:04.000
Caption: permission to read any secret that&#39;s in

01:39:02.399 --> 01:39:06.000
Caption: the account

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.759
Caption: um finally we can see set as default

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.839
Caption: that&#39;s just another flag we set which

01:39:07.759 --> 01:39:11.279
Caption: makes that the default version that&#39;s

01:39:09.839 --> 01:39:13.439
Caption: going to be used by any role that isn&#39;t

01:39:11.279 --> 01:39:15.279
Caption: pinned to a specific version of the

01:39:13.439 --> 01:39:16.959
Caption: policy

01:39:15.279 --> 01:39:19.039
Caption: our shell&#39;s a little wonky which is why

01:39:16.959 --> 01:39:20.718
Caption: you can see all the uh

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:22.959
Caption: all the commands are repeated a second

01:39:20.719 --> 01:39:22.960
Caption: time

01:39:23.199 --> 01:39:27.760
Caption: right so having run that uh it succeeded

01:39:25.919 --> 01:39:29.359
Caption: we didn&#39;t get any errors and we now have

01:39:27.759 --> 01:39:30.638
Caption: a new version of the policy there

01:39:29.359 --> 01:39:32.879
Caption: version three

01:39:30.639 --> 01:39:36.239
Caption: and because it we gave it set as default

01:39:32.879 --> 01:39:38.158
Caption: it is now the default um

01:39:36.238 --> 01:39:40.399
Caption: right so now we&#39;re just going to go back

01:39:38.159 --> 01:39:44.639
Caption: to the cli command that we ran before to

01:39:40.399 --> 01:39:44.638
Caption: get the secret value and see if it works

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:48.718
Caption: so it did work we didn&#39;t get the same

01:39:46.799 --> 01:39:51.040
Caption: error and we have in secret string here

01:39:48.719 --> 01:39:52.719
Caption: the actual content of the secret

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:54.239
Caption: now in this case this is just a flag but

01:39:52.719 --> 01:39:56.239
Caption: obviously in a real application it could

01:39:54.238 --> 01:39:59.439
Caption: be something far more interesting like

01:39:56.238 --> 01:40:01.599
Caption: database credentials or really anything

01:39:59.439 --> 01:40:04.959
Caption: um also worth calling out at this point

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:06.239
Caption: that um although we just used our powers

01:40:04.959 --> 01:40:08.159
Caption: to

01:40:06.238 --> 01:40:10.158
Caption: give ourselves access to read any secret

01:40:08.159 --> 01:40:11.840
Caption: in the account we do effectively have

01:40:10.159 --> 01:40:15.520
Caption: admin access we could have written any

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:17.599
Caption: policy that allowed any or all um aws

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:19.359
Caption: api actions um and that would have been

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:22.359
Caption: accepted and we would have those

01:40:19.359 --> 01:40:22.359
Caption: permissions

01:40:23.199 --> 01:40:25.600
Caption: all right

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:30.879
Caption: so how do we get here oh

01:40:29.759 --> 01:40:33.678
Caption: right so

01:40:30.879 --> 01:40:37.040
Caption: um let&#39;s just reflect a little bit on

01:40:33.679 --> 01:40:38.959
Caption: what the developer did right and wrong

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:40.879
Caption: oh actually first off we&#39;re going to

01:40:38.959 --> 01:40:42.560
Caption: talk about automation because

01:40:40.879 --> 01:40:44.158
Caption: we just did that by hand

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.560
Caption: and we were lucky in that we had

01:40:44.159 --> 01:40:48.560
Caption: permissions in our role to list the

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:50.239
Caption: policies that are attached to the role

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:52.639
Caption: and to query the granular permissions

01:40:50.238 --> 01:40:54.158
Caption: that that policy consists of

01:40:52.639 --> 01:40:56.719
Caption: if you don&#39;t have that there are tools

01:40:54.159 --> 01:40:59.199
Caption: available um that can do it for you um

01:40:56.719 --> 01:41:02.159
Caption: examples being weird al pacu and red

01:40:59.199 --> 01:41:05.280
Caption: bodo and what they&#39;ll basically do is

01:41:02.159 --> 01:41:06.880
Caption: hit the aws api using your credentials

01:41:05.279 --> 01:41:08.718
Caption: probe it and they can distinguish from

01:41:06.879 --> 01:41:11.118
Caption: the error messages that they get whether

01:41:08.719 --> 01:41:13.199
Caption: you actually have that permission or not

01:41:11.119 --> 01:41:15.360
Caption: um so if you&#39;re working blind those

01:41:13.199 --> 01:41:16.560
Caption: tools really help you out

01:41:15.359 --> 01:41:17.839
Caption: all right now we&#39;re gonna reflect on

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:19.199
Caption: what the developer

01:41:17.839 --> 01:41:20.560
Caption: should have done

01:41:19.199 --> 01:41:22.880
Caption: the main thing is they should have

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.319
Caption: applied the principle of least privilege

01:41:22.879 --> 01:41:25.839
Caption: this being an api host it should have

01:41:24.319 --> 01:41:28.000
Caption: had one clear role and only had

01:41:25.839 --> 01:41:30.000
Caption: permissions it needed for that so they

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.759
Caption: should have segregated the duties that

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.439
Caption: ec2 instance shouldn&#39;t be spinning up by

01:41:31.759 --> 01:41:36.158
Caption: the infrastructure nor should it be

01:41:33.439 --> 01:41:37.040
Caption: manipulating i am policies

01:41:36.159 --> 01:41:39.439
Caption: um

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.280
Caption: and another recommendation would be

01:41:39.439 --> 01:41:43.678
Caption: don&#39;t put wild cards in your iam

01:41:41.279 --> 01:41:45.678
Caption: policies scope them as granular as you

01:41:43.679 --> 01:41:48.560
Caption: can to the actual resources that you do

01:41:45.679 --> 01:41:48.560
Caption: need to manipulate

01:41:48.639 --> 01:41:53.600
Caption: and that brings us to the end of the

01:41:49.919 --> 01:41:55.279
Caption: live demo of the pen test

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.280
Caption: so what did we learn

01:41:55.279 --> 01:41:59.839
Caption: we learned to sanitize and control user

01:41:57.279 --> 01:42:01.359
Caption: inputs wherever they arise

01:41:59.839 --> 01:42:03.439
Caption: follow the principle of least privilege

01:42:01.359 --> 01:42:05.359
Caption: like james just mentioned applied

01:42:03.439 --> 01:42:07.359
Caption: defense in depth this is particularly

01:42:05.359 --> 01:42:09.359
Caption: irrelevant especially to that that

01:42:07.359 --> 01:42:11.439
Caption: second and third layer where the

01:42:09.359 --> 01:42:13.520
Caption: developer left themselves a bit of a

01:42:11.439 --> 01:42:15.919
Caption: mess some notes they said to themselves

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:17.520
Caption: well this thing&#39;s a bit buggy it&#39;s a bit

01:42:15.919 --> 01:42:20.158
Caption: vulnerable but it&#39;s not customer facing

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:21.359
Caption: anyway i&#39;m the admin who what could go

01:42:20.159 --> 01:42:24.080
Caption: wrong

01:42:21.359 --> 01:42:25.600
Caption: you should always be assuming that well

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:28.959
Caption: you shouldn&#39;t always assume that your

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:31.520
Caption: defenses will fail but you should aim to

01:42:28.959 --> 01:42:33.839
Caption: minimize blast radius whenever someone

01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:35.760
Caption: can get into one layer to prevent them

01:42:33.839 --> 01:42:37.520
Caption: from being able to exploit that to get

01:42:35.759 --> 01:42:39.198
Caption: further access

01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:41.600
Caption: ideally if there weren&#39;t those bugs in

01:42:39.199 --> 01:42:43.280
Caption: that for that second layer the

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.439
Caption: an attacker that got in

01:42:43.279 --> 01:42:47.839
Caption: through the the first bug which was the

01:42:45.439 --> 01:42:50.319
Caption: mass assignment wouldn&#39;t be able to then

01:42:47.839 --> 01:42:51.919
Caption: get onto the actual api host through

01:42:50.319 --> 01:42:53.919
Caption: further exploitation they would just be

01:42:51.919 --> 01:42:56.000
Caption: able to read the to-do list and that

01:42:53.919 --> 01:42:57.520
Caption: would be about it

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.359
Caption: the rest of the learnings depends on the

01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:02.799
Caption: path we took so i hope you were paying

01:42:59.359 --> 01:43:04.399
Caption: attention during the various reflections

01:43:02.799 --> 01:43:06.879
Caption: different paths would would have had

01:43:04.399 --> 01:43:08.799
Caption: different key takeaways

01:43:06.879 --> 01:43:11.118
Caption: how can you get into this like i

01:43:08.799 --> 01:43:13.439
Caption: promised we&#39;re hoping to expire at least

01:43:11.119 --> 01:43:15.760
Caption: some of the audience to participate in

01:43:13.439 --> 01:43:17.759
Caption: this sort of thing uh try hack me and

01:43:15.759 --> 01:43:19.919
Caption: hack the box are both really valuable

01:43:17.759 --> 01:43:21.359
Caption: resources that i&#39;ve personally really

01:43:19.919 --> 01:43:24.238
Caption: enjoyed

01:43:21.359 --> 01:43:25.919
Caption: i spent about a year working with eric

01:43:24.238 --> 01:43:27.759
Caption: who&#39;s in the room on various

01:43:25.919 --> 01:43:28.639
Caption: hack-the-box exercises they were lots of

01:43:27.759 --> 01:43:30.079
Caption: fun

01:43:28.639 --> 01:43:33.040
Caption: really satisfying to break into

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:35.359
Caption: particular shout out to ipsec tutorials

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:37.760
Caption: whenever a box gets retired you can be

01:43:35.359 --> 01:43:39.919
Caption: sure that there&#39;s a really useful

01:43:37.759 --> 01:43:41.519
Caption: and thorough video tutorial on how to

01:43:39.919 --> 01:43:44.000
Caption: break into that box will go up on

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:46.319
Caption: youtube immediately after

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.520
Caption: pentester lab and os juice drop are

01:43:46.319 --> 01:43:50.000
Caption: other things that i haven&#39;t used

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:51.040
Caption: personally but have had recommendations

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.639
Caption: for

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:54.000
Caption: there are also some certs you can aim

01:43:52.639 --> 01:43:56.880
Caption: for in this space not really for the

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.839
Caption: beginners but something to maybe aspire

01:43:56.879 --> 01:43:59.359
Caption: for

01:43:57.839 --> 01:44:02.399
Caption: i&#39;m also interested in going for these

01:43:59.359 --> 01:44:03.839
Caption: myself oscp and ceh

01:44:02.399 --> 01:44:05.359
Caption: offensive security certified

01:44:03.839 --> 01:44:08.799
Caption: professional and certified ethical

01:44:05.359 --> 01:44:11.198
Caption: hacker that was a mouthful uh

01:44:08.799 --> 01:44:13.759
Caption: interesting certs that i think anyone in

01:44:11.199 --> 01:44:16.000
Caption: this space could be interested in aiming

01:44:13.759 --> 01:44:18.959
Caption: for eventually and then like james and i

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.959
Caption: mentioned wacts or wsctf or really any

01:44:18.959 --> 01:44:23.759
Caption: ctfs are a great environment to get

01:44:20.959 --> 01:44:26.319
Caption: exposed to all sorts of things related

01:44:23.759 --> 01:44:28.399
Caption: to pen testing or cyber in general

01:44:26.319 --> 01:44:31.359
Caption: and they&#39;re a great environment like

01:44:28.399 --> 01:44:33.279
Caption: full very supportive community and just

01:44:31.359 --> 01:44:34.959
Caption: a great area to learn about these sorts

01:44:33.279 --> 01:44:38.718
Caption: of things other than being left out in

01:44:34.959 --> 01:44:38.718
Caption: the foyer when you arrive late

01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:43.839
Caption: finally we&#39;d like to give a big thanks

01:44:41.759 --> 01:44:45.519
Caption: to all the sponsors of ddd without which

01:44:43.839 --> 01:44:47.520
Caption: this talk would not have been possible

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:49.839
Caption: so thank you very much and that&#39;s all

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:49.839
Caption: from us

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:53.279
Caption: [Applause]

01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:59.199
Caption: we&#39;ve got about five minutes left in

01:44:57.119 --> 01:45:03.479
Caption: this session if anyone has a question

01:44:59.199 --> 01:45:03.479
Caption: for james down the back

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.879
Caption: hi um

01:45:07.439 --> 01:45:10.799
Caption: yes so

01:45:08.879 --> 01:45:13.520
Caption: let&#39;s say you&#39;re just a graduate

01:45:10.799 --> 01:45:16.079
Caption: postgrad or undergrad cyber security

01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:18.799
Caption: student so to further increase improve

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:21.199
Caption: your chances and having no internship

01:45:18.799 --> 01:45:24.158
Caption: available made to you you just do some

01:45:21.199 --> 01:45:26.320
Caption: more ctfs and then try and get

01:45:24.159 --> 01:45:27.840
Caption: some more certifications and then

01:45:26.319 --> 01:45:28.879
Caption: fingers crossed and the company will

01:45:27.839 --> 01:45:30.560
Caption: look at you even though you don&#39;t have

01:45:28.879 --> 01:45:34.560
Caption: any years of experience

01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:37.199
Caption: to employ you as a pen testers etc

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:40.000
Caption: um to be clear neither james nor i are

01:45:37.199 --> 01:45:40.800
Caption: professional pen testers um

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.839
Caption: but

01:45:40.799 --> 01:45:43.919
Caption: yeah

01:45:41.839 --> 01:45:46.000
Caption: in terms of looking for jobs most of

01:45:43.919 --> 01:45:46.879
Caption: most of the pen testers i know are

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.479
Caption: actually

01:45:46.879 --> 01:45:49.678
Caption: ones who went in from software

01:45:48.479 --> 01:45:52.399
Caption: engineering

01:45:49.679 --> 01:45:54.560
Caption: that&#39;s not necessarily the only path uh

01:45:52.399 --> 01:45:57.359
Caption: obviously now more and more there&#39;s more

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:58.479
Caption: focus on on

01:45:57.359 --> 01:46:01.439
Caption: cyber security

01:45:58.479 --> 01:46:04.399
Caption: studies um and you could potentially get

01:46:01.439 --> 01:46:06.000
Caption: into that via entry-level roles i&#39;m

01:46:04.399 --> 01:46:07.520
Caption: most of the pen testers i know are not

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.839
Caption: so entry level though i don&#39;t know i

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:12.639
Caption: feel like there&#39;s probably more

01:46:09.839 --> 01:46:13.520
Caption: analyst roles that would be a suitable

01:46:12.639 --> 01:46:15.679
Caption: start

01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:17.839
Caption: would be my my gut instinct but i

01:46:15.679 --> 01:46:20.479
Caption: haven&#39;t done a huge amount of research

01:46:17.839 --> 01:46:22.238
Caption: into actually becoming a pen tester can

01:46:20.479 --> 01:46:24.560
Caption: i also add there&#39;s a thousand people

01:46:22.238 --> 01:46:25.919
Caption: here today and so there&#39;s going to be a

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:28.159
Caption: few people in the room there&#39;s certainly

01:46:25.919 --> 01:46:29.520
Caption: some of the organizations are recruiting

01:46:28.159 --> 01:46:31.360
Caption: so the more people you meet today the

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:34.799
Caption: better your chances are of finding that

01:46:31.359 --> 01:46:34.799
Caption: we&#39;ve got another question from anyone

01:46:34.879 --> 01:46:37.040
Caption: cool

01:46:38.159 --> 01:46:42.239
Caption: thanks for the talk today guys um

01:46:40.479 --> 01:46:43.839
Caption: so my question is i appreciate that both

01:46:42.238 --> 01:46:47.198
Caption: of you guys are in software engineering

01:46:43.839 --> 01:46:50.399
Caption: not um cyber at the moment but um my

01:46:47.199 --> 01:46:53.119
Caption: question is in an enterprise pen test

01:46:50.399 --> 01:46:54.479
Caption: um how do you know the scope of which to

01:46:53.119 --> 01:46:56.000
Caption: you know basically attack the system

01:46:54.479 --> 01:46:57.359
Caption: you&#39;re trying to you&#39;re trying to attest

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.679
Caption: to because obviously you could spend

01:46:57.359 --> 01:47:01.040
Caption: lots of time and eventually break in but

01:46:59.679 --> 01:47:03.040
Caption: you probably have limited resources in

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:04.719
Caption: limited time so

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:06.239
Caption: yeah i mean that

01:47:04.719 --> 01:47:09.600
Caption: that really ends up being an agreement

01:47:06.238 --> 01:47:10.879
Caption: between the the pentester and the

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:12.239
Caption: teste

01:47:10.879 --> 01:47:14.479
Caption: um so

01:47:12.238 --> 01:47:15.839
Caption: yeah that that varies i know certainly

01:47:14.479 --> 01:47:17.679
Caption: when i was working at bankwest there&#39;s

01:47:15.839 --> 01:47:19.198
Caption: all sorts of um

01:47:17.679 --> 01:47:21.199
Caption: meetings with the team beforehand where

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:23.199
Caption: you talk about what the exact scope of

01:47:21.199 --> 01:47:25.360
Caption: the work will be and i&#39;m sure the same

01:47:23.199 --> 01:47:27.600
Caption: can be applied to basically any pen test

01:47:25.359 --> 01:47:29.359
Caption: right you you agree with the client

01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.040
Caption: what the scope for the pen test is how

01:47:29.359 --> 01:47:32.000
Caption: long you&#39;re going to spend on it

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:34.319
Caption: um

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.639
Caption: you&#39;ve probably as a pen test you&#39;ve

01:47:34.319 --> 01:47:39.198
Caption: probably got a playbook of like a very

01:47:36.639 --> 01:47:40.560
Caption: systematic approach to testing all sorts

01:47:39.199 --> 01:47:42.719
Caption: of vulnerabilities

01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:44.080
Caption: and you go through those and if you find

01:47:42.719 --> 01:47:46.480
Caption: stuff you find stuff and you report

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.479
Caption: those back if you don&#39;t you don&#39;t

01:47:46.479 --> 01:47:50.399
Caption: and then yeah the depth at which your

01:47:48.479 --> 01:47:52.000
Caption: your pen testing again would be

01:47:50.399 --> 01:47:54.158
Caption: something agreed on

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.238
Caption: probably prior to the test unless maybe

01:47:54.159 --> 01:47:57.360
Caption: you&#39;re doing a pure red teaming exercise

01:47:56.238 --> 01:47:59.678
Caption: in which case

01:47:57.359 --> 01:48:01.040
Caption: uh potentially all bars are off but

01:47:59.679 --> 01:48:02.400
Caption: uh

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:04.000
Caption: unlikely

01:48:02.399 --> 01:48:07.839
Caption: awesome um we&#39;ve probably got time for

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Caption: one more question if there&#39;s anyone else

01:48:07.839 --> 01:48:12.238
Caption: can i ask a question then there is a

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.238
Caption: question

01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:17.119
Caption: more an observation really but um i&#39;ve

01:48:15.439 --> 01:48:19.040
Caption: been in software development for a while

01:48:17.119 --> 01:48:20.560
Caption: and there&#39;s almost no code base that

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:22.959
Caption: doesn&#39;t have any kind of vulnerability

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:24.239
Caption: or something if you look look and dig

01:48:22.959 --> 01:48:26.479
Caption: deep enough so there&#39;s always something

01:48:24.238 --> 01:48:29.919
Caption: to find no matter where you&#39;re looking

01:48:26.479 --> 01:48:32.080
Caption: yeah absolutely yeah i would 100 agree

01:48:29.919 --> 01:48:33.678
Caption: that&#39;s kind of just a quick comment as

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:35.600
Caption: well as that&#39;s obviously another

01:48:33.679 --> 01:48:37.760
Caption: argument for applying defense in depth

01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:39.600
Caption: and just making sure that uh if any

01:48:37.759 --> 01:48:41.678
Caption: layer of your architecture does get

01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:44.719
Caption: breached that you kind of minimize the

01:48:41.679 --> 01:48:46.719
Caption: the risk that that poses to other layers

01:48:44.719 --> 01:48:48.960
Caption: and i&#39;d assume that&#39;s where the um

01:48:46.719 --> 01:48:50.560
Caption: bounty hunting and the rewards come from

01:48:48.959 --> 01:48:53.040
Caption: for a lot of these organizations i&#39;ve

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:55.280
Caption: seen so you if you&#39;re looking for a job

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:56.239
Caption: in this space then go for a bounty

01:48:55.279 --> 01:48:58.638
Caption: hunting

01:48:56.238 --> 01:49:00.319
Caption: expedition another pen testing adventure

01:48:58.639 --> 01:49:03.450
Caption: can i have another round of applause for

01:49:00.319 --> 01:49:08.238
Caption: james one and james two thank you

01:53:28.238 --> 01:53:33.039
Caption: we got a little problem

01:53:30.879 --> 01:53:34.479
Caption: as you know our motto is you need a

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.919
Caption: professional bodyguard delivered to your

01:53:34.479 --> 01:53:38.159
Caption: door in less than half an hour you&#39;ve

01:53:35.919 --> 01:53:40.479
Caption: got it buddy but without an app ain&#39;t no

01:53:38.159 --> 01:53:43.199
Caption: bodyguard getting delivered nowhere so

01:53:40.479 --> 01:53:46.560
Caption: where are we with that uh the app is

01:53:43.199 --> 01:53:47.599
Caption: almost ready uh we just need

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:49.839
Caption: three

01:53:47.599 --> 01:53:51.599
Caption: more days we need it asap

01:53:49.839 --> 01:53:53.598
Caption: okay team what&#39;s the status on the app

01:53:51.599 --> 01:53:56.000
Caption: we&#39;re good to go except our login

01:53:53.599 --> 01:53:57.840
Caption: experience is a disaster

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.679
Caption: we need something to keep our users data

01:53:57.839 --> 01:54:02.399
Caption: private

01:53:59.679 --> 01:54:04.320
Caption: and to keep the hackers out

01:54:02.399 --> 01:54:06.560

Caption: but this is better this is better

02:05:26.319 --> 02:05:29.598
Caption: um cool so what i want to kind of talk

02:05:28.319 --> 02:05:32.158
Caption: about is like better authentication

02:05:29.599 --> 02:05:34.560
Caption: experiences i have this concern that uh

02:05:32.159 --> 02:05:36.239
Caption: when we build applications on the web uh

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:38.800
Caption: that uh the important and interesting

02:05:36.238 --> 02:05:40.158
Caption: things that we work on are you know um

02:05:38.799 --> 02:05:41.678
Caption: the applications are actually building

02:05:40.159 --> 02:05:43.520
Caption: that that thing beyond the login

02:05:41.679 --> 02:05:45.920
Caption: experience the thing that users actually

02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:47.119
Caption: want to get to and the login tends to be

02:05:45.919 --> 02:05:48.799
Caption: um

02:05:47.119 --> 02:05:51.040
Caption: friction the thing that goes in the way

02:05:48.799 --> 02:05:53.839
Caption: of of people getting to do the stuff uh

02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:56.799
Caption: that they actually uh care about uh and

02:05:53.839 --> 02:05:58.959
Caption: i want to improve that um because

02:05:56.799 --> 02:06:01.198
Caption: so i was looking at some data uh a while

02:05:58.959 --> 02:06:02.799
Caption: back uh and um

02:06:01.199 --> 02:06:04.960
Caption: this 24 number comes from a survey that

02:06:02.799 --> 02:06:07.359
Caption: google did at the end of 2018 uh about

02:06:04.959 --> 02:06:09.040
Caption: kind of security uh things that users do

02:06:07.359 --> 02:06:11.198
Caption: and 24 was the number of people who use

02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:13.679
Caption: a password manager uh from that uh

02:06:11.199 --> 02:06:14.800
Caption: survey uh 24 not bad actually pretty

02:06:13.679 --> 02:06:15.920
Caption: good number but that still means three

02:06:14.799 --> 02:06:18.559
Caption: quarters of people are not using a

02:06:15.919 --> 02:06:19.439
Caption: password manager which sort of is bad

02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:22.959
Caption: because

02:06:19.439 --> 02:06:24.560
Caption: these passwords right uh in fact um

02:06:22.959 --> 02:06:25.599
Caption: and i do want to kind of prefix this by

02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:27.919
Caption: the fact that you know we&#39;re probably

02:06:25.599 --> 02:06:30.159
Caption: developers or power users of computers

02:06:27.919 --> 02:06:32.479
Caption: and our laptops uh in our daily work and

02:06:30.159 --> 02:06:34.479
Caption: we probably are amongst those 24 that do

02:06:32.479 --> 02:06:36.560
Caption: use a password manager or in fact have

02:06:34.479 --> 02:06:38.479
Caption: um

02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:39.839
Caption: worked on your own login experience so

02:06:38.479 --> 02:06:40.879
Caption: that you don&#39;t have to worry about that

02:06:39.839 --> 02:06:42.638
Caption: it&#39;s normally a click you don&#39;t have to

02:06:40.879 --> 02:06:43.919
Caption: know your own password but that&#39;s not

02:06:42.639 --> 02:06:46.719
Caption: the case for most people and that&#39;s my

02:06:43.919 --> 02:06:49.198
Caption: point here um

02:06:46.719 --> 02:06:50.800
Caption: this uh awkward sort of flow diagram

02:06:49.199 --> 02:06:52.639
Caption: kind of is is the experience of somebody

02:06:50.799 --> 02:06:54.238
Caption: logging into a website right and it

02:06:52.639 --> 02:06:56.000
Caption: starts at the top where you hit the

02:06:54.238 --> 02:06:58.718
Caption: login page right there and immediately

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.079
Caption: you ask yourself do i know my username

02:06:58.719 --> 02:07:01.440
Caption: because that&#39;s not necessarily clear now

02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:02.639
Caption: sometimes it&#39;s your email sometimes it&#39;s

02:07:01.439 --> 02:07:04.319
Caption: something else and if you don&#39;t you have

02:07:02.639 --> 02:07:07.599
Caption: to go through a nice little username

02:07:04.319 --> 02:07:09.759
Caption: refl um uh username reset passflow

02:07:07.599 --> 02:07:11.360
Caption: if you&#39;ve got past the uh like username

02:07:09.759 --> 02:07:12.479
Caption: like if the answer to this is yes and or

02:07:11.359 --> 02:07:13.839
Caption: indeed maybe

02:07:12.479 --> 02:07:15.279
Caption: because you can never tell until you put

02:07:13.839 --> 02:07:16.959
Caption: it in and we get to do i know my

02:07:15.279 --> 02:07:18.238
Caption: password and again that&#39;s the same

02:07:16.959 --> 02:07:19.359
Caption: problem maybe you do maybe you don&#39;t if

02:07:18.238 --> 02:07:21.598
Caption: you&#39;ve got in a password manager you&#39;re

02:07:19.359 --> 02:07:22.799
Caption: probably fine but if you are not if

02:07:21.599 --> 02:07:25.840
Caption: you&#39;re a regular user if you&#39;re one of

02:07:22.799 --> 02:07:27.759
Caption: the 74 of 76 of people not using one do

02:07:25.839 --> 02:07:29.520
Caption: you know your password who knows maybe

02:07:27.759 --> 02:07:30.959
Caption: have to go through a reset flow uh if

02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:32.719
Caption: you think you know both of those you can

02:07:30.959 --> 02:07:33.919
Caption: enter them in and hope for the best at

02:07:32.719 --> 02:07:35.280
Caption: which point you find out whether you

02:07:33.919 --> 02:07:37.198
Caption: knew your email address sorry your

02:07:35.279 --> 02:07:38.559
Caption: username and password and either go back

02:07:37.199 --> 02:07:40.800
Caption: to the start and maybe go through one of

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:42.239
Caption: the reset flows again or you get on and

02:07:40.799 --> 02:07:44.078
Caption: maybe hit a two-factor notification

02:07:42.238 --> 02:07:45.919
Caption: challenge because this is a secure site

02:07:44.079 --> 02:07:46.959
Caption: and uh and then a text message is sent

02:07:45.919 --> 02:07:48.639
Caption: to your phone your phone&#39;s in another

02:07:46.959 --> 02:07:51.359
Caption: room you give up you close the computer

02:07:48.639 --> 02:07:52.880
Caption: you throw it out the window um

02:07:51.359 --> 02:07:54.638
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s a sort of regular user

02:07:52.879 --> 02:07:55.919
Caption: flow of logging into a website

02:07:54.639 --> 02:07:56.959
Caption: um

02:07:55.919 --> 02:07:58.560
Caption: that&#39;s the two factors that indicate

02:07:56.959 --> 02:08:01.919
Caption: message right yeah sure the user

02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:03.839
Caption: experience of this uh ends up being um i

02:08:01.919 --> 02:08:05.678
Caption: i have a scale of like zero to poop

02:08:03.839 --> 02:08:07.198
Caption: emoji on this and it&#39;s just poop emoji

02:08:05.679 --> 02:08:09.119
Caption: that&#39;s

02:08:07.199 --> 02:08:11.840
Caption: this is not a scientific scale it&#39;s just

02:08:09.119 --> 02:08:13.599
Caption: how i like to think about things um

02:08:11.839 --> 02:08:16.078
Caption: it&#39;s a bad user experience and we can

02:08:13.599 --> 02:08:17.119
Caption: make it better um because it&#39;s full of

02:08:16.079 --> 02:08:18.320
Caption: friction that&#39;s what i&#39;m kind of talking

02:08:17.119 --> 02:08:20.560
Caption: about it&#39;s full of that like do i know

02:08:18.319 --> 02:08:22.718
Caption: my username do i know my password

02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:24.159
Caption: am i right about either of those

02:08:22.719 --> 02:08:25.520
Caption: and and how long does it take to

02:08:24.159 --> 02:08:27.119
Caption: actually get to the thing we wanted to

02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:29.040
Caption: do in the first place do we want to buy

02:08:27.119 --> 02:08:30.719
Caption: the thing do we want to

02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:32.239
Caption: carry on the service whatever

02:08:30.719 --> 02:08:34.239
Caption: so i&#39;m going to run us through how we

02:08:32.238 --> 02:08:36.078
Caption: can usernames and passwords better real

02:08:34.238 --> 02:08:38.158
Caption: quick i&#39;m going to start with the html

02:08:36.079 --> 02:08:39.919
Caption: um html can actually help us an awful

02:08:38.159 --> 02:08:41.760
Caption: lot in this place it makes the form more

02:08:39.919 --> 02:08:44.560
Caption: accessible it makes the experience

02:08:41.759 --> 02:08:46.319
Caption: better and quicker um and so this is

02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:47.839
Caption: what a login form might look like right

02:08:46.319 --> 02:08:50.879
Caption: we&#39;ve got a fairly straightforward form

02:08:47.839 --> 02:08:52.879
Caption: it&#39;s got two inputs a a

02:08:50.879 --> 02:08:54.879
Caption: a text input for our username a password

02:08:52.879 --> 02:08:56.799
Caption: input for our password the labels point

02:08:54.879 --> 02:08:58.399
Caption: to the right things it&#39;s fine it&#39;s quite

02:08:56.799 --> 02:08:59.359
Caption: good but there&#39;s more we can do to it

02:08:58.399 --> 02:09:01.678
Caption: than this

02:08:59.359 --> 02:09:04.718
Caption: um the input element itself is one of my

02:09:01.679 --> 02:09:06.959
Caption: favorite elements uh in html uh possibly

02:09:04.719 --> 02:09:09.760
Caption: my favorite because um because of how

02:09:06.959 --> 02:09:10.718
Caption: much uh scope it has the the amount of

02:09:09.759 --> 02:09:12.479
Caption: things you can do with a single

02:09:10.719 --> 02:09:15.199
Caption: attribute that change the behavior of an

02:09:12.479 --> 02:09:17.119
Caption: input element is incredible um

02:09:15.199 --> 02:09:19.520
Caption: the attributes available to us some are

02:09:17.119 --> 02:09:20.800
Caption: less used than others uh and the ones i

02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:22.639
Caption: want to kind of call out here well

02:09:20.799 --> 02:09:24.000
Caption: firstly uh the type now you might be

02:09:22.639 --> 02:09:25.679
Caption: able to change an important one to a

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.279
Caption: checkbox or a radio button or something

02:09:25.679 --> 02:09:29.119
Caption: but in this particular case if my form

02:09:27.279 --> 02:09:30.559
Caption: was if my username was in fact an email

02:09:29.119 --> 02:09:32.399
Caption: address as well then we probably should

02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:34.000
Caption: change that type to an email

02:09:32.399 --> 02:09:36.319
Caption: uh that&#39;s going to help us on a mobile

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.119
Caption: device it&#39;s going to pop up uh

02:09:36.319 --> 02:09:38.560
Caption: the

02:09:37.119 --> 02:09:40.239
Caption: keyboard which has an app symbol like

02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:42.079
Caption: prominently on it which is useful and

02:09:40.238 --> 02:09:43.759
Caption: helps people out and then we&#39;ve got

02:09:42.079 --> 02:09:45.280
Caption: autocomplete autocomplete is going to

02:09:43.759 --> 02:09:46.879
Caption: feature quite a bit in this because it&#39;s

02:09:45.279 --> 02:09:47.598
Caption: the greatest attribute the input element

02:09:46.879 --> 02:09:50.319
Caption: has

02:09:47.599 --> 02:09:52.159
Caption: uh in this case uh autocomplete username

02:09:50.319 --> 02:09:53.919
Caption: and autocomplete current password allow

02:09:52.159 --> 02:09:55.760
Caption: us to give hints to the browser and

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:57.198
Caption: indeed to any other technology like a

02:09:55.759 --> 02:10:00.479
Caption: password manager that might want to

02:09:57.199 --> 02:10:02.000
Caption: autofill these things in for you um

02:10:00.479 --> 02:10:03.679
Caption: username is really useful there is also

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.079
Caption: order complete email but that&#39;s really

02:10:03.679 --> 02:10:08.000
Caption: for when you&#39;re um dealing with uh

02:10:06.079 --> 02:10:09.280
Caption: somebody&#39;s actual contact details not

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.238
Caption: the thing you&#39;re using to log into a

02:10:09.279 --> 02:10:13.039
Caption: thing

02:10:10.238 --> 02:10:14.799
Caption: um current password is really cool

02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:16.319
Caption: because there&#39;s also a new password

02:10:14.799 --> 02:10:18.078
Caption: autocomplete

02:10:16.319 --> 02:10:19.279
Caption: that&#39;s particularly useful for your page

02:10:18.079 --> 02:10:20.800
Caption: where you&#39;re changing your password and

02:10:19.279 --> 02:10:22.559
Caption: you have three different password inputs

02:10:20.799 --> 02:10:24.158
Caption: on the same page one&#39;s for the old

02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:26.959
Caption: password and two are for repeating the

02:10:24.159 --> 02:10:28.400
Caption: new password um but without new password

02:10:26.959 --> 02:10:29.839
Caption: and current password

02:10:28.399 --> 02:10:31.759
Caption: uh uh

02:10:29.839 --> 02:10:33.839
Caption: browsers or

02:10:31.759 --> 02:10:35.359
Caption: password managers will autofill the same

02:10:33.839 --> 02:10:36.879
Caption: thing into all three but if you have new

02:10:35.359 --> 02:10:38.560
Caption: password and current password then

02:10:36.879 --> 02:10:40.158
Caption: they&#39;ll be able to offer suggestions the

02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:42.319
Caption: new password and the existing one to the

02:10:40.159 --> 02:10:44.959
Caption: current password actually firefox itself

02:10:42.319 --> 02:10:47.198
Caption: uh offers you a secure suggestion if you

02:10:44.959 --> 02:10:49.439
Caption: have autocomplete is new password on an

02:10:47.199 --> 02:10:51.040
Caption: input really useful um so don&#39;t forget

02:10:49.439 --> 02:10:52.879
Caption: about these autocomplete look it up it&#39;s

02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:54.479
Caption: amazing um i have a little demo of just

02:10:52.879 --> 02:10:55.919
Caption: kind of my existing login flow i&#39;ve got

02:10:54.479 --> 02:10:57.599
Caption: a demo application that we&#39;re going to

02:10:55.919 --> 02:10:59.520
Caption: deal with for the rest of this app and

02:10:57.599 --> 02:11:01.520
Caption: all it does is log in which is annoying

02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:04.319
Caption: really because the entire app is 100

02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:05.839
Caption: friction um but this

02:11:04.319 --> 02:11:07.919
Caption: it&#39;s got nothing on the other side of it

02:11:05.839 --> 02:11:09.198
Caption: it&#39;s amazing it&#39;s got a log out button

02:11:07.919 --> 02:11:11.759
Caption: um but i just want to show you like this

02:11:09.199 --> 02:11:13.119
Caption: is the existing uh experience right we

02:11:11.759 --> 02:11:14.638
Caption: we go to login we have to do all the

02:11:13.119 --> 02:11:16.719
Caption: typing now i happen to know my username

02:11:14.639 --> 02:11:18.320
Caption: and password for this uh the password is

02:11:16.719 --> 02:11:20.079
Caption: secret

02:11:18.319 --> 02:11:22.000
Caption: it&#39;s the most secure six character

02:11:20.079 --> 02:11:23.520
Caption: password i can think of uh and i&#39;m

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.719
Caption: logged in uh in fact i&#39;ve got a

02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:27.520
Caption: two-factor authentication message and

02:11:24.719 --> 02:11:29.840
Caption: there it is over the other side um

02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:31.279
Caption: eight four three two nine three cool uh

02:11:29.839 --> 02:11:35.439
Caption: so i had to look at my phone and then i

02:11:31.279 --> 02:11:36.959
Caption: come back over here and oh my goodness

02:11:35.439 --> 02:11:39.119
Caption: are we logged in yet yes we&#39;re logged in

02:11:36.959 --> 02:11:41.040
Caption: cool um go away

02:11:39.119 --> 02:11:42.399
Caption: i&#39;ll come back to that later um so

02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:44.319
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s the sort of that&#39;s our

02:11:42.399 --> 02:11:45.839
Caption: existing slow i have to type everything

02:11:44.319 --> 02:11:47.678
Caption: in version

02:11:45.839 --> 02:11:49.040
Caption: so let&#39;s see what else we can do that

02:11:47.679 --> 02:11:50.239
Caption: had our auto complete attributes on it

02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:51.760
Caption: but because i wasn&#39;t using any other

02:11:50.238 --> 02:11:53.759
Caption: technology to auto complete things that

02:11:51.759 --> 02:11:54.879
Caption: didn&#39;t show up to help

02:11:53.759 --> 02:11:56.319
Caption: but this is where we get to credential

02:11:54.879 --> 02:11:57.040
Caption: management and for the people who put

02:11:56.319 --> 02:11:59.040
Caption: their

02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:59.839
Caption: hands up they know about this it&#39;s great

02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:01.119
Caption: um

02:11:59.839 --> 02:12:02.560
Caption: credential management apis in the

02:12:01.119 --> 02:12:05.679
Caption: browsers allow us to store and then

02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:07.760
Caption: retrieve our user&#39;s credentials um and

02:12:05.679 --> 02:12:09.360
Caption: so i was annoyingly clicking away the

02:12:07.759 --> 02:12:10.718
Caption: browser pop up there to say i would like

02:12:09.359 --> 02:12:12.479
Caption: to would you like to save your username

02:12:10.719 --> 02:12:13.599
Caption: and password in this uh but that was

02:12:12.479 --> 02:12:16.000
Caption: just kind of the browser doing on its

02:12:13.599 --> 02:12:18.560
Caption: own what we can actually hook into is is

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.679
Caption: triggering that and then using it later

02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:21.439
Caption: because if we

02:12:19.679 --> 02:12:24.000
Caption: as a developer as the website trigger

02:12:21.439 --> 02:12:25.919
Caption: that app um that pop-up

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:27.759
Caption: we&#39;re actually able to retrieve the

02:12:25.919 --> 02:12:29.759
Caption: password from a username and password

02:12:27.759 --> 02:12:31.919
Caption: from it later and make a smoother login

02:12:29.759 --> 02:12:33.359
Caption: flow and i&#39;ll show you how that works

02:12:31.919 --> 02:12:35.439
Caption: um here&#39;s what the code looks like it&#39;s

02:12:33.359 --> 02:12:37.359
Caption: actually fairly simple

02:12:35.439 --> 02:12:39.198
Caption: uh we look for the password credential

02:12:37.359 --> 02:12:40.799
Caption: to be in the window object and when we

02:12:39.199 --> 02:12:42.320
Caption: have that we can create a password

02:12:40.799 --> 02:12:44.399
Caption: credential using

02:12:42.319 --> 02:12:46.799
Caption: our user id and password so this is once

02:12:44.399 --> 02:12:48.079
Caption: we know uh that the user id and password

02:12:46.799 --> 02:12:51.439
Caption: is correct so this could happen at

02:12:48.079 --> 02:12:53.040
Caption: registration or on a successful login

02:12:51.439 --> 02:12:54.159
Caption: and uh and once we create that

02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:56.079
Caption: credential

02:12:54.159 --> 02:12:58.479
Caption: um oh hold on i&#39;ve got things there

02:12:56.079 --> 02:13:00.879
Caption: there we go this line a weight navigator

02:12:58.479 --> 02:13:02.718
Caption: credentials store credential

02:13:00.879 --> 02:13:04.479
Caption: allows you to then

02:13:02.719 --> 02:13:05.920
Caption: store it in the uh in the browser&#39;s

02:13:04.479 --> 02:13:06.959
Caption: credential management browser&#39;s password

02:13:05.919 --> 02:13:08.639
Caption: manager

02:13:06.959 --> 02:13:10.560
Caption: uh and the real power of this is the

02:13:08.639 --> 02:13:12.320
Caption: next page where we get to ask for it

02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:13.040
Caption: back again so when the user comes to log

02:13:12.319 --> 02:13:14.718
Caption: in

02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:17.119
Caption: we can go and retrieve those credentials

02:13:14.719 --> 02:13:18.960
Caption: we say navigator credentials get uh

02:13:17.119 --> 02:13:21.040
Caption: password is true we&#39;re asking for

02:13:18.959 --> 02:13:22.718
Caption: password in this case and that pops up

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:24.239
Caption: another um

02:13:22.719 --> 02:13:25.199
Caption: permissions thing from the browser to

02:13:24.238 --> 02:13:26.158
Caption: say

02:13:25.199 --> 02:13:27.520
Caption: do you want to log in with these

02:13:26.159 --> 02:13:28.239
Caption: credentials

02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:31.119
Caption: and

02:13:28.238 --> 02:13:32.718
Caption: and if the user approves that then uh

02:13:31.119 --> 02:13:34.399
Caption: they are through you can

02:13:32.719 --> 02:13:35.760
Caption: write a function that says

02:13:34.399 --> 02:13:37.198
Caption: pass them through

02:13:35.759 --> 02:13:38.799
Caption: you can actually do this silently as

02:13:37.199 --> 02:13:39.599
Caption: well which is which is kind of cool i&#39;m

02:13:38.799 --> 02:13:41.040
Caption: not

02:13:39.599 --> 02:13:42.320
Caption: necessarily the biggest fan of it but uh

02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:43.119
Caption: if um

02:13:42.319 --> 02:13:44.560
Caption: uh

02:13:43.119 --> 02:13:46.639
Caption: you can kind of do that without the

02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:49.919
Caption: permissions dialogue and uh and that

02:13:46.639 --> 02:13:51.040
Caption: will pass a user straight through um

02:13:49.919 --> 02:13:52.479
Caption: you know get the credentials for them

02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:54.399
Caption: and allow you to log them straight in no

02:13:52.479 --> 02:13:56.000
Caption: friction whatsoever i think maybe a

02:13:54.399 --> 02:13:57.198
Caption: little bit of friction is useful

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.199
Caption: and so but you can turn that on with

02:13:57.199 --> 02:14:01.119
Caption: unmediated is true here

02:13:59.199 --> 02:14:03.520
Caption: um but you can make sure that

02:14:01.119 --> 02:14:05.760
Caption: permissions always pop up if say a user

02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:06.879
Caption: has specifically logged out uh and so

02:14:05.759 --> 02:14:09.678
Caption: when signing out if you call on

02:14:06.879 --> 02:14:10.638
Caption: navigator credentials um prevent silent

02:14:09.679 --> 02:14:12.320
Caption: access

02:14:10.639 --> 02:14:13.599
Caption: uh that&#39;s a good thing for you know a

02:14:12.319 --> 02:14:16.000
Caption: user properly sign out they don&#39;t want

02:14:13.599 --> 02:14:17.040
Caption: to be automatically signed in again

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.238
Caption: um

02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:19.839
Caption: what does this look like i think it&#39;s

02:14:18.238 --> 02:14:21.198
Caption: it&#39;s important to show kind of better

02:14:19.839 --> 02:14:23.198
Caption: what this looks like so if i go and log

02:14:21.199 --> 02:14:25.360
Caption: out i&#39;m gonna go back through my process

02:14:23.199 --> 02:14:27.920
Caption: well one second i need to

02:14:25.359 --> 02:14:30.479
Caption: check out the version of the code

02:14:27.919 --> 02:14:32.000
Caption: that does this

02:14:30.479 --> 02:14:34.159
Caption: credential management there you go

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.040
Caption: basically just uncommented a bunch of

02:14:34.159 --> 02:14:37.439
Caption: stuff

02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:38.719
Caption: um and now if i go and log in this time

02:14:37.439 --> 02:14:40.799
Caption: around we&#39;re going to see that same

02:14:38.719 --> 02:14:42.400
Caption: browser pop up to say hey do you want to

02:14:40.799 --> 02:14:45.598
Caption: store your username and password but

02:14:42.399 --> 02:14:47.678
Caption: this time i&#39;m asking for that access

02:14:45.599 --> 02:14:49.520
Caption: and i will be able to

02:14:47.679 --> 02:14:51.760
Caption: use it again later so when we&#39;re going

02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:54.000
Caption: to log in we know it&#39;s successful log in

02:14:51.759 --> 02:14:55.439
Caption: because we we&#39;ve succeeded i&#39;m saving it

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.799
Caption: i&#39;ve got to go to my tv authentication

02:14:55.439 --> 02:14:58.560
Caption: we&#39;ll cover making that better in a

02:14:56.799 --> 02:15:01.198
Caption: second seven

02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:03.119
Caption: oh three four three four

02:15:01.199 --> 02:15:04.320
Caption: and submit that and i&#39;m through now this

02:15:03.119 --> 02:15:05.919
Caption: time i&#39;m going to log out log back in

02:15:04.319 --> 02:15:08.919
Caption: again and we see it work

02:15:05.919 --> 02:15:08.919
Caption: no

02:15:09.759 --> 02:15:12.559
Caption: which one is it

02:15:13.119 --> 02:15:16.000
Caption: friction exactly

02:15:14.639 --> 02:15:18.400
Caption: well it doesn&#39;t help if i&#39;m logging in

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:23.159
Caption: and out a bunch of times but uh it is

02:15:18.399 --> 02:15:23.158
Caption: that or i didn&#39;t do the right typing

02:15:23.599 --> 02:15:26.639
Caption: let&#39;s try it one more time

02:15:27.359 --> 02:15:30.718
Caption: yeah all right cool i was right i just

02:15:28.799 --> 02:15:32.078
Caption: typed it wrong so this time around i

02:15:30.719 --> 02:15:33.679
Caption: used that credential management api and

02:15:32.079 --> 02:15:36.479
Caption: as i got a successful login i stored the

02:15:33.679 --> 02:15:38.639
Caption: thing in the browser uh so if i log out

02:15:36.479 --> 02:15:41.759
Caption: again and then go to login it&#39;s going to

02:15:38.639 --> 02:15:43.199
Caption: know it&#39;s me and suggest that in uh sign

02:15:41.759 --> 02:15:44.479
Caption: in look at that

02:15:43.199 --> 02:15:45.679
Caption: do you want to sign in as film i

02:15:44.479 --> 02:15:47.520
Caption: absolutely do

02:15:45.679 --> 02:15:49.440
Caption: sign in so we&#39;ve turned in this

02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:50.639
Caption: particular case our sign in process from

02:15:49.439 --> 02:15:53.119
Caption: having to remember your username and

02:15:50.639 --> 02:15:55.919
Caption: password uh having to type it all in uh

02:15:53.119 --> 02:15:57.919
Caption: into a single click a single tap and

02:15:55.919 --> 02:15:59.678
Caption: we&#39;re through and i&#39;m very excited about

02:15:57.919 --> 02:16:01.359
Caption: that uh sadly obviously we&#39;ve got stuck

02:15:59.679 --> 02:16:02.639
Caption: at two-factor authentication again

02:16:01.359 --> 02:16:04.000
Caption: um

02:16:02.639 --> 02:16:05.520
Caption: which hasn&#39;t even come through now oh

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.479
Caption: it&#39;s nine four one five two five there

02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:09.199
Caption: we go

02:16:06.479 --> 02:16:11.119
Caption: i have a bank that um

02:16:09.199 --> 02:16:12.639
Caption: screams at me every time they send me a

02:16:11.119 --> 02:16:15.040
Caption: text message with a code and be like

02:16:12.639 --> 02:16:16.959
Caption: never tell anyone this i&#39;m like it times

02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:19.040
Caption: out in five minutes

02:16:16.959 --> 02:16:21.040
Caption: i will tell people then

02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:22.479
Caption: um

02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:23.760
Caption: it&#39;s true you shouldn&#39;t obviously share

02:16:22.479 --> 02:16:25.679
Caption: these things oh my god i&#39;m gonna run out

02:16:23.759 --> 02:16:27.279
Caption: of time brilliant so we got logged in

02:16:25.679 --> 02:16:28.719
Caption: let&#39;s go back i&#39;m gonna run out of time

02:16:27.279 --> 02:16:30.000
Caption: if i don&#39;t get through this so let&#39;s

02:16:28.719 --> 02:16:32.160
Caption: talk about two facts authentication i

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.080
Caption: think it&#39;s super important because we

02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:35.759
Caption: have these um

02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:37.839
Caption: usernames and passwords and people who

02:16:35.759 --> 02:16:39.839
Caption: don&#39;t use password managers and people

02:16:37.839 --> 02:16:41.518
Caption: who uh repeat themselves and use the

02:16:39.839 --> 02:16:43.040
Caption: same parcels all the time and the whole

02:16:41.518 --> 02:16:43.839
Caption: thing is friction over and over again

02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:45.839
Caption: right

02:16:43.839 --> 02:16:47.839
Caption: so password reuse this was in the same

02:16:45.839 --> 02:16:49.919
Caption: survey that i mentioned at the start uh

02:16:47.839 --> 02:16:52.160
Caption: the blue slice of the pie there uh is

02:16:49.919 --> 02:16:53.120
Caption: people who reuse passwords some of the

02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:55.040
Caption: time

02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:57.919
Caption: the yellow slices people who reuse

02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:59.518
Caption: passwords all of the time i love that

02:16:57.919 --> 02:17:01.438
Caption: the people answering the survey were

02:16:59.518 --> 02:17:03.598
Caption: just like how many passwords do i have

02:17:01.439 --> 02:17:05.359
Caption: just one i just

02:17:03.598 --> 02:17:06.718
Caption: use it everywhere it&#39;s the greatest

02:17:05.359 --> 02:17:08.959
Caption: password those are the people getting

02:17:06.718 --> 02:17:11.120
Caption: hacked all of the time it was 13 of

02:17:08.959 --> 02:17:13.280
Caption: people in this particular survey

02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:15.359
Caption: 52 said some of the time

02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:17.040
Caption: uh 13 said all of the time i reuse

02:17:15.359 --> 02:17:18.880
Caption: passwords and then this nice little

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:21.200
Caption: green slice of people who say they never

02:17:18.879 --> 02:17:22.959
Caption: reuse passwords 35 percent of people in

02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:25.599
Caption: the survey said they never reuse

02:17:22.959 --> 02:17:27.120
Caption: passwords i&#39;ll remind you that 24 of

02:17:25.598 --> 02:17:29.678
Caption: people said that they use a password

02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:33.678
Caption: manager so 11 of people have a

02:17:29.678 --> 02:17:33.678
Caption: photographic memory or they&#39;re lying

02:17:35.439 --> 02:17:38.960
Caption: and that&#39;s our users for you

02:17:37.439 --> 02:17:41.599
Caption: um

02:17:38.959 --> 02:17:43.438
Caption: it&#39;s a bad experience and so and thus

02:17:41.598 --> 02:17:45.678
Caption: you know we also do um that always comes

02:17:43.439 --> 02:17:47.040
Caption: up too tiny uh we uh the problem about

02:17:45.678 --> 02:17:49.518
Caption: this is is our problem we&#39;ve put all

02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:51.200
Caption: these problem problematic password

02:17:49.518 --> 02:17:52.398
Caption: things in the way of people uh your

02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:54.240
Caption: password must contain at least eight

02:17:52.399 --> 02:17:55.840
Caption: letters a capital a protagonist with

02:17:54.240 --> 02:17:58.000
Caption: good character development a twist and a

02:17:55.839 --> 02:17:59.358
Caption: happy ending

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.638
Caption: if you consider you&#39;ll never remember

02:17:59.359 --> 02:18:02.559
Caption: that past or maybe you&#39;ll only ever

02:18:00.638 --> 02:18:03.759
Caption: remember that password it&#39;s a great

02:18:02.558 --> 02:18:05.518
Caption: story

02:18:03.759 --> 02:18:07.438
Caption: um but what this actually you know the

02:18:05.518 --> 02:18:09.199
Caption: real the real things we do is say we

02:18:07.439 --> 02:18:10.960
Caption: must have a capital letter uh some

02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:12.559
Caption: lowercase letters a number and a special

02:18:10.959 --> 02:18:14.319
Caption: character right and this is the perfect

02:18:12.558 --> 02:18:16.000
Caption: password for that because it does

02:18:14.319 --> 02:18:17.200
Caption: everything it&#39;s got eight characters

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:20.240
Caption: it&#39;s got 10 characters in it look at

02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:23.120
Caption: that enormously long password

02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:25.280
Caption: but this gives um attackers an easy way

02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:26.479
Caption: to um patternize things it&#39;s a

02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:28.000
Caption: dictionary word which starts with a

02:18:26.478 --> 02:18:29.438
Caption: capital letter ends with the number one

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.718
Caption: because why would you think beyond one

02:18:29.439 --> 02:18:31.840
Caption: and uses the exclamation point because

02:18:30.718 --> 02:18:33.919
Caption: it&#39;s a special character but it uses the

02:18:31.839 --> 02:18:35.120
Caption: same key as number one you don&#39;t even

02:18:33.919 --> 02:18:37.120
Caption: have to move your finger when you&#39;re

02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:38.319
Caption: typing it in

02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:39.919
Caption: and so when you have patterns like this

02:18:38.319 --> 02:18:41.840
Caption: it makes it easier to brute force attack

02:18:39.919 --> 02:18:43.518
Caption: this kind of thing and that&#39;s a bad

02:18:41.839 --> 02:18:45.518
Caption: thing and then on the other hand uh

02:18:43.518 --> 02:18:47.678
Caption: there are sites leaking our data all out

02:18:45.518 --> 02:18:50.959
Caption: over the place um and and if you don&#39;t

02:18:47.678 --> 02:18:52.959
Caption: know how ibmpone.com uh uh that&#39;s that

02:18:50.959 --> 02:18:54.638
Caption: gathers those uh leaks those breaches

02:18:52.959 --> 02:18:57.040
Caption: and shares just tell you whether your

02:18:54.638 --> 02:18:58.080
Caption: password has been part of that and yes

02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:59.439
Caption: it has

02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:01.040
Caption: um

02:18:59.439 --> 02:19:03.679
Caption: so either other people are leaking our

02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:05.359
Caption: passwords or users are using the same

02:19:03.678 --> 02:19:07.200
Caption: password or they&#39;re using an easily

02:19:05.359 --> 02:19:08.639
Caption: broken password and so that&#39;s why we

02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:11.120
Caption: have two-factor authentication so we can

02:19:08.638 --> 02:19:12.638
Caption: have one extra factor one other reason

02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:15.359
Caption: to believe that this person is the right

02:19:12.638 --> 02:19:18.080
Caption: person signing in uh and hooray for

02:19:15.359 --> 02:19:20.800
Caption: two-factor um but the user experience

02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:22.638
Caption: remains on the poop scale of

02:19:20.799 --> 02:19:24.240
Caption: poop

02:19:22.638 --> 02:19:27.199
Caption: uh because it&#39;s still more friction like

02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:30.160
Caption: i said we&#39;ve watched me struggle to

02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:32.160
Caption: enter a code several times just today

02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:33.919
Caption: and so let&#39;s make it better we can

02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:35.919
Caption: actually help these get auto-completed

02:19:33.919 --> 02:19:37.438
Caption: and autofilled in again so i&#39;m going

02:19:35.919 --> 02:19:39.598
Caption: back to the html and go back to

02:19:37.439 --> 02:19:41.760
Caption: autocomplete because on the input when

02:19:39.598 --> 02:19:44.000
Caption: you have a code if you include

02:19:41.759 --> 02:19:46.398
Caption: autocomplete is one-time code then in

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.799
Caption: safari uh when your text message comes

02:19:46.399 --> 02:19:51.680
Caption: through uh it comes up in that little

02:19:48.799 --> 02:19:53.040
Caption: autocomplete but on the um

02:19:51.679 --> 02:19:54.559
Caption: keyboard autocomplete on the keyboard

02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:56.479
Caption: right and it&#39;s just this one little

02:19:54.559 --> 02:19:57.839
Caption: attribute that allows that to happen and

02:19:56.478 --> 02:19:59.119
Caption: it&#39;s wonderful if you&#39;ve not seen it

02:19:57.839 --> 02:20:01.599
Caption: before it looks like this you go to

02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:04.240
Caption: login you get the message sent to you

02:20:01.599 --> 02:20:06.239
Caption: and uh and as you enter just go to the

02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:08.959
Caption: into the code there it is boom all right

02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:11.200
Caption: it&#39;s too quick there&#39;s no friction

02:20:08.959 --> 02:20:12.399
Caption: it&#39;s wonderful um and and so you only

02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:14.000
Caption: need that one little thing for it so

02:20:12.399 --> 02:20:15.280
Caption: there it is coming up in the top of the

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.879
Caption: keyboard there

02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:18.720
Caption: and you just hit that it enters with

02:20:16.879 --> 02:20:19.919
Caption: through it&#39;s glorious

02:20:18.719 --> 02:20:22.799
Caption: we can do some other things to make this

02:20:19.919 --> 02:20:24.478
Caption: nicer uh if your one-time code

02:20:22.799 --> 02:20:26.240
Caption: input is a text input then you&#39;re going

02:20:24.478 --> 02:20:27.279
Caption: to see the keyboard for text which is

02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:29.120
Caption: not a good thing because it&#39;s normally

02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:30.720
Caption: six digits that we&#39;re entering

02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:32.479
Caption: and so if you actually add like input

02:20:30.719 --> 02:20:33.599
Caption: mode as numeric uh it&#39;s going to make

02:20:32.478 --> 02:20:35.039
Caption: that a better experience for people who

02:20:33.599 --> 02:20:36.000
Caption: can&#39;t auto complete because that brings

02:20:35.040 --> 02:20:37.599
Caption: you up

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.120
Caption: with your number keypad much nicer

02:20:37.599 --> 02:20:39.919
Caption: number keypad

02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:41.520
Caption: so

02:20:39.919 --> 02:20:42.959
Caption: let&#39;s think about that and then what

02:20:41.519 --> 02:20:44.959
Caption: about the desktop i mean this is only

02:20:42.959 --> 02:20:46.639
Caption: safari right now and that was only ios

02:20:44.959 --> 02:20:49.200
Caption: that that showed up there but actually

02:20:46.639 --> 02:20:51.839
Caption: if you happen to be a big safari fan

02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:54.160
Caption: and have your um desktop safari set up

02:20:51.839 --> 02:20:57.120
Caption: as well uh this actually works across to

02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:58.799
Caption: the desktop um and i&#39;m gonna hold up

02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:00.160
Caption: look at that

02:20:58.799 --> 02:21:01.200
Caption: um the

02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:02.959
Caption: when the message comes through to your

02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:05.040
Caption: iphone if you&#39;ve got imessage like set

02:21:02.959 --> 02:21:07.759
Caption: up onto your device as well it&#39;s going

02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:10.839
Caption: to do the autocomplete on your desktop

02:21:07.759 --> 02:21:13.919
Caption: as long as you&#39;re in safari

02:21:10.839 --> 02:21:16.080
Caption: right so what&#39;s the other thing web otp

02:21:13.919 --> 02:21:17.519
Caption: is our is our final thing here uh this

02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:19.200
Caption: is the sort of chrome android and

02:21:17.519 --> 02:21:21.599
Caption: pushing to a um

02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:23.520
Caption: web standard solution for this uh and it

02:21:21.599 --> 02:21:25.199
Caption: allows actually a bit more security in

02:21:23.519 --> 02:21:27.119
Caption: this like that autocomplete kind of sort

02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:29.200
Caption: of works and but it really does actually

02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:30.879
Caption: just see a text message see like six

02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:32.560
Caption: digits in it and assume everything else

02:21:30.879 --> 02:21:36.080
Caption: works whereas web otp is a bit more

02:21:32.559 --> 02:21:38.398
Caption: strict than that um it enforces that uh

02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:40.080
Caption: the messages you send uh the two-factor

02:21:38.399 --> 02:21:42.399
Caption: authentication code into have two bits

02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:43.839
Caption: at the end of it uh an at symbol

02:21:42.399 --> 02:21:45.280
Caption: followed by the domain name on which the

02:21:43.839 --> 02:21:47.679
Caption: person should be logging in and then a

02:21:45.280 --> 02:21:49.359
Caption: hash symbol and then the code now the at

02:21:47.679 --> 02:21:51.358
Caption: symbol on the domain allows the browser

02:21:49.359 --> 02:21:53.120
Caption: and the operating system to agree

02:21:51.359 --> 02:21:54.800
Caption: to autocomplete on this site and this

02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:56.959
Caption: site only which is a good fishing

02:21:54.799 --> 02:21:58.959
Caption: defense right if you are being fished

02:21:56.959 --> 02:22:00.639
Caption: for your two-factor authentication code

02:21:58.959 --> 02:22:02.160
Caption: uh

02:22:00.639 --> 02:22:03.759
Caption: you&#39;re on a different domain and

02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:05.439
Caption: therefore this will not offer the

02:22:03.759 --> 02:22:07.358
Caption: autocomplete for it because it doesn&#39;t

02:22:05.439 --> 02:22:08.800
Caption: match up so it&#39;s a security thing to

02:22:07.359 --> 02:22:10.720
Caption: actually use this

02:22:08.799 --> 02:22:12.240
Caption: which is very nice

02:22:10.719 --> 02:22:14.239
Caption: um so

02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:16.479
Caption: uh web otp actually uses that very same

02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:17.839
Caption: credential management api uh looks a

02:22:16.478 --> 02:22:19.679
Caption: little like this like this and instead

02:22:17.839 --> 02:22:21.919
Caption: of asking for the password in this case

02:22:19.679 --> 02:22:23.919
Caption: uh we asked for the otp transport of sms

02:22:21.919 --> 02:22:25.599
Caption: i really like this because um that&#39;s an

02:22:23.919 --> 02:22:27.679
Caption: array which can have one element in it

02:22:25.599 --> 02:22:30.000
Caption: which is the string sms

02:22:27.679 --> 02:22:31.438
Caption: which is which is cool um

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:33.759
Caption: you&#39;ve got loads of options there to go

02:22:31.439 --> 02:22:36.319
Caption: in that array um so let&#39;s see that in

02:22:33.759 --> 02:22:38.240
Caption: action uh i&#39;m going to go to the demo

02:22:36.319 --> 02:22:40.240
Caption: and this time bring up the phone i&#39;m

02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:42.560
Caption: going to do this on the phone this time

02:22:40.240 --> 02:22:42.560
Caption: uh

02:22:42.879 --> 02:22:46.398
Caption: assuming we can get a browser there we

02:22:44.559 --> 02:22:48.959
Caption: go so if i go back and refresh this

02:22:46.399 --> 02:22:50.959
Caption: login page firstly what you&#39;ll notice is

02:22:48.959 --> 02:22:53.040
Caption: that because i&#39;m in logged in in both my

02:22:50.959 --> 02:22:54.959
Caption: google account uh my chrome account on

02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:56.559
Caption: both the desktop and the phone that it&#39;s

02:22:54.959 --> 02:22:58.000
Caption: already synced my username and password

02:22:56.559 --> 02:22:59.679
Caption: across so that is already still a

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Caption: one-tap process to get through the

02:22:59.679 --> 02:23:05.839

Caption: oops

02:23:14.959 --> 02:23:19.229
Caption: because that wouldn&#39;t have had the code

02:23:16.639 --> 02:23:21.120

Caption: again i don&#39;t know

02:23:26.639 --> 02:23:29.759
Caption: back to login we get off at the login

02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:30.799

02:23:29.759 --> 02:23:32.559
Caption: message

02:23:30.799 --> 02:23:34.478

02:23:32.559 --> 02:23:36.000
Caption: message

02:23:34.478 --> 02:23:37.438
Caption: so it&#39;s coming into the text and there&#39;s

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.799
Caption: the permissions dialogue to say hey do

02:23:37.439 --> 02:23:40.160
Caption: you want to read this and enter the code

02:23:38.799 --> 02:23:43.120
Caption: and we allow it we get access to the

02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:45.520
Caption: code and we&#39;re through our login

02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:47.439
Caption: has gone from typing typing typing

02:23:45.519 --> 02:23:49.519
Caption: finding the phone and getting in there

02:23:47.439 --> 02:23:51.760
Caption: to tap to yes log me in

02:23:49.519 --> 02:23:53.839
Caption: and tap yes use that code i think that&#39;s

02:23:51.759 --> 02:23:55.919
Caption: cool um

02:23:53.839 --> 02:23:56.959
Caption: but you might be asking

02:23:55.919 --> 02:23:58.160
Caption: what about the desktop in this

02:23:56.959 --> 02:24:00.639
Caption: particular case

02:23:58.160 --> 02:24:02.399
Caption: and um

02:24:00.639 --> 02:24:04.959
Caption: uh the desktop actually works as well

02:24:02.399 --> 02:24:07.520
Caption: it&#39;s very cool um i hope it works so it

02:24:04.959 --> 02:24:10.559
Caption: can be a bit finicky but if you are in

02:24:07.519 --> 02:24:12.079
Caption: chrome uh in your android device and uh

02:24:10.559 --> 02:24:13.919
Caption: your browser

02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:15.359
Caption: and they all agree with each other that

02:24:13.919 --> 02:24:18.319
Caption: you&#39;re the same person

02:24:15.359 --> 02:24:20.479
Caption: then the mobile device will offer you up

02:24:18.319 --> 02:24:22.560
Caption: to copy across the code that has arrived

02:24:20.478 --> 02:24:24.719
Caption: from the text message into the browser

02:24:22.559 --> 02:24:26.239
Caption: it tends to require the the devices to

02:24:24.719 --> 02:24:28.000
Caption: be on the same network as well that has

02:24:26.240 --> 02:24:29.439
Caption: failed for me in the past and i have not

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.719
Caption: yet managed to check because this is a

02:24:29.439 --> 02:24:34.080
Caption: last minute talk haven&#39;t managed to

02:24:30.719 --> 02:24:35.759
Caption: check if this works on this network but

02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:37.040
Caption: cross your fingers for me we&#39;re going to

02:24:35.759 --> 02:24:39.279
Caption: go and log in we&#39;re going to sign in

02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:41.280
Caption: with a one tap and what we should see is

02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:42.399
Caption: the text message coming over here on the

02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:45.919
Caption: right hand side

02:24:42.399 --> 02:24:47.520
Caption: and then an offer to copy that across

02:24:45.919 --> 02:24:49.839
Caption: or

02:24:47.519 --> 02:24:52.159
Caption: just crash the browser in the background

02:24:49.839 --> 02:24:55.519
Caption: amazing

02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:56.959
Caption: that was unexpected um

02:24:55.519 --> 02:24:59.119
Caption: let&#39;s let&#39;s

02:24:56.959 --> 02:25:00.879
Caption: let&#39;s give it one more attempt at that

02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:02.319
Caption: uh i&#39;m gonna log in with that it doesn&#39;t

02:25:00.879 --> 02:25:04.080
Caption: need the browser to be open this is just

02:25:02.319 --> 02:25:06.640
Caption: the the um

02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:08.080
Caption: the device doing it and so the message

02:25:06.639 --> 02:25:10.398
Caption: should arrive and then it should give me

02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:12.240
Caption: the option there we go submit this code

02:25:10.399 --> 02:25:13.680
Caption: on the other computer if i press submit

02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:15.759
Caption: there i&#39;m hands off for the other side

02:25:13.679 --> 02:25:16.959
Caption: we submit the code and it enters it and

02:25:15.759 --> 02:25:18.478
Caption: logs me in

02:25:16.959 --> 02:25:20.559
Caption: um so

02:25:18.478 --> 02:25:22.639
Caption: uh the security there like you have to

02:25:20.559 --> 02:25:24.318
Caption: be able you have to you know say that

02:25:22.639 --> 02:25:26.080
Caption: that code is allowed to go from this

02:25:24.319 --> 02:25:26.959
Caption: device to the computer and yeah if

02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:28.000
Caption: you&#39;re not on the same network and

02:25:26.959 --> 02:25:30.399
Caption: things like that it&#39;s not going to offer

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:33.519
Caption: that up um but now our two-factor

02:25:30.399 --> 02:25:35.280
Caption: authentication is just a

02:25:33.519 --> 02:25:36.639
Caption: it&#39;s much less friction

02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:38.000
Caption: uh so it works across the desktop as

02:25:36.639 --> 02:25:38.879
Caption: well at least if you&#39;re in chrome and

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.959
Caption: chrome

02:25:38.879 --> 02:25:44.240
Caption: uh just talking a little bit about the

02:25:40.959 --> 02:25:47.040
Caption: future like i i kind of um laugh at the

02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:47.919
Caption: idea that we have this uh single

02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:49.679
Caption: array

02:25:47.919 --> 02:25:50.719
Caption: uh that has one potential element to it

02:25:49.679 --> 02:25:52.719
Caption: but i like this because it&#39;s the way

02:25:50.719 --> 02:25:54.239
Caption: that web gets uh designed and designed

02:25:52.719 --> 02:25:56.080
Caption: well it&#39;s it&#39;s designed for

02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:57.680
Caption: extensibility and if we come up with

02:25:56.080 --> 02:26:01.200
Caption: other transports and other ways to get

02:25:57.679 --> 02:26:03.759
Caption: an otp code from a device uh we can add

02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:05.200
Caption: to this api and so i hope uh this is

02:26:03.759 --> 02:26:08.240
Caption: something that can be built to deal with

02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:09.919
Caption: authenticator apps or indeed um other

02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:11.359
Caption: device-based uh

02:26:09.919 --> 02:26:13.280
Caption: authentication

02:26:11.359 --> 02:26:15.359
Caption: uh being able to web or then maybe from

02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:17.760
Caption: a from a phone to a to a desktop

02:26:15.359 --> 02:26:20.720
Caption: anything like that um this is extensible

02:26:17.759 --> 02:26:22.398
Caption: and ready but in general i think uh

02:26:20.719 --> 02:26:23.919
Caption: these little these little changes these

02:26:22.399 --> 02:26:25.280
Caption: little tweaks credential management api

02:26:23.919 --> 02:26:27.759
Caption: and the autocomplete kind of things that

02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:29.040
Caption: we have available to us allow us to uh

02:26:27.759 --> 02:26:30.559
Caption: enhance and progressively enhance

02:26:29.040 --> 02:26:32.319
Caption: because it doesn&#39;t work everywhere that

02:26:30.559 --> 02:26:35.199
Caption: progressively enhance the experience for

02:26:32.319 --> 02:26:36.800
Caption: login and uh and i&#39;d i&#39;d recommend that

02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:38.560
Caption: you take another look at your own login

02:26:36.799 --> 02:26:40.080
Caption: flows and see if you can reduce the

02:26:38.559 --> 02:26:42.318
Caption: friction for your users when they&#39;re

02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:45.120
Caption: getting into the into your application

02:26:42.319 --> 02:26:46.160
Caption: um that&#39;s uh that was a bit quick but

02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:47.359

02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:13.359
Caption: where are we with that uh the app is

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.399

02:32:14.399 --> 02:32:18.399

02:32:18.399 --> 02:32:22.720
Caption: we&#39;re good to go except our login

02:32:20.399 --> 02:32:24.640
Caption: experience is a disaster

02:32:22.719 --> 02:32:26.478

02:32:24.639 --> 02:32:29.199
Caption: private

02:32:26.478 --> 02:32:31.119
Caption: and to keep the hackers out

02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:33.359
Caption: and it needs to work flawlessly because

02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:35.520
Caption: because i don&#39;t want to lose one single

02:32:33.359 --> 02:32:37.760

02:32:49.439 --> 02:32:52.560
Caption: like to use observer can do that yeah

02:32:50.959 --> 02:32:54.240
Caption: but it needs to be secure we can&#39;t have

02:32:52.559 --> 02:32:55.599
Caption: our app compromised by breaches not a

02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:56.959
Caption: problem and it needs to scale if we get

02:32:55.599 --> 02:32:58.959
Caption: hit with a ton of traffic and if it

02:32:56.959 --> 02:33:00.479
Caption: stalls or freezes up i will get fired we

02:32:58.959 --> 02:33:10.070

Caption: when working remote

Caption: needs to see the evidence in the room

02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:53.040
Caption: i also talk in the media a lot you see

02:34:50.639 --> 02:34:54.478
Caption: my face sometimes on the television

02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:58.319
Caption: and on the radio

02:34:54.478 --> 02:35:01.358
Caption: i think it&#39;s hilarious that they let me

02:34:58.319 --> 02:35:04.800
Caption: um and also the biggest deal is that my

02:35:01.359 --> 02:35:05.840
Caption: team is here for the first time ever

02:35:04.799 --> 02:35:08.240
Caption: together

02:35:05.839 --> 02:35:10.839
Caption: in the same room and the same state

02:35:08.240 --> 02:35:13.200
Caption: can i get you guys to stand

02:35:10.839 --> 02:35:14.820
Caption: up no they&#39;re not going to stand up

02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:16.799
Caption: because they&#39;re shy introverts

02:35:14.820 --> 02:35:20.800
Caption: [Laughter]

02:35:16.799 --> 02:35:22.398
Caption: um so some notes about this talk

02:35:20.799 --> 02:35:24.318
Caption: today what i&#39;m going to go through is

02:35:22.399 --> 02:35:25.920
Caption: the benefits of remote work

02:35:24.319 --> 02:35:27.919
Caption: from the position of the employer and

02:35:25.919 --> 02:35:30.160
Caption: the employee i&#39;m going to talk about the

02:35:27.919 --> 02:35:32.478
Caption: challenges of remote work and healthy

02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:34.080
Caption: boundaries and communication and

02:35:32.478 --> 02:35:35.438
Caption: distraction guilt

02:35:34.080 --> 02:35:37.040
Caption: i&#39;m also going to talk about adapting

02:35:35.439 --> 02:35:39.200
Caption: the environment

02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:41.439
Caption: and what that&#39;s meant for us

02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:44.719
Caption: and i&#39;m going to put some final notes

02:35:41.439 --> 02:35:46.800
Caption: and lessons learned from the pandemic

02:35:44.719 --> 02:35:48.398
Caption: so first off

02:35:46.799 --> 02:35:50.799
Caption: time coverage

02:35:48.399 --> 02:35:52.399
Caption: benefits for the employer um so two of

02:35:50.799 --> 02:35:54.080
Caption: our team that&#39;s flown in from melbourne

02:35:52.399 --> 02:35:56.399
Caption: and sydney

02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:58.160
Caption: they are obviously two hours wait are

02:35:56.399 --> 02:35:59.439
Caption: you ahead or behind i can&#39;t remember my

02:35:58.160 --> 02:36:00.240
Caption: brain&#39;s not working

02:35:59.439 --> 02:36:02.560
Caption: ahead cool

02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:04.399
Caption: [Laughter]

02:36:02.559 --> 02:36:07.358
Caption: so on either side of the day we actually

02:36:04.399 --> 02:36:08.560
Caption: have an extra four hours for our clients

02:36:07.359 --> 02:36:10.959
Caption: so it means that we have a little bit

02:36:08.559 --> 02:36:13.279
Caption: extra coverage

02:36:10.959 --> 02:36:15.519
Caption: um more focused work happens when we&#39;re

02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:19.439
Caption: working remote because we don&#39;t have

02:36:15.519 --> 02:36:21.679
Caption: meetings on zoom every day

02:36:19.439 --> 02:36:24.000
Caption: because we get fatigued

02:36:21.679 --> 02:36:26.639
Caption: we figured that out really early on in

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.639
Caption: the pandemic

02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:32.479
Caption: a larger pool of future employees

02:36:29.919 --> 02:36:34.639
Caption: so i mentioned before i have cptsd

02:36:32.478 --> 02:36:37.438
Caption: anxiety disorder

02:36:34.639 --> 02:36:39.839
Caption: half of our team have ptsd executive

02:36:37.439 --> 02:36:43.200
Caption: dysfunction adhd

02:36:39.839 --> 02:36:45.919
Caption: all of the other acronyms um

02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:49.200
Caption: and what it means is that we cater for a

02:36:45.919 --> 02:36:52.240
Caption: higher level of neurodivergence

02:36:49.200 --> 02:36:53.839
Caption: so having different types of work styles

02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:57.359
Caption: means that we actually have different

02:36:53.839 --> 02:36:59.839
Caption: values that we can add to the business

02:36:57.359 --> 02:37:02.160
Caption: reduce this fixed cost for a business

02:36:59.839 --> 02:37:05.839
Caption: owner is really important so obviously i

02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:08.319
Caption: don&#39;t pay for an office

02:37:05.839 --> 02:37:11.438
Caption: and for me that became really important

02:37:08.319 --> 02:37:13.040
Caption: because i want to invest in my team

02:37:11.439 --> 02:37:15.120
Caption: so as a business you could see this as

02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:17.120
Caption: an opportunity to downsize

02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:19.200
Caption: and reduce operating costs and invest

02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:22.240
Caption: more in your people technology and for

02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:22.240
Caption: me also training

02:37:24.319 --> 02:37:29.520
Caption: benefits for the employee

02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:31.520
Caption: less time in commute who loves commuting

02:37:29.519 --> 02:37:33.279
Caption: not me

02:37:31.519 --> 02:37:36.879
Caption: on average in western australia you

02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:39.280
Caption: could spend 26.5 days a year

02:37:36.879 --> 02:37:41.519
Caption: commuting to work

02:37:39.280 --> 02:37:43.600
Caption: that&#39;s a lot of time

02:37:41.519 --> 02:37:45.599
Caption: um for our team the fact that we don&#39;t

02:37:43.599 --> 02:37:47.119
Caption: have to commute to work means that we

02:37:45.599 --> 02:37:49.519
Caption: have that time back and we can spend it

02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:52.080
Caption: on our hobbies

02:37:49.519 --> 02:37:53.759
Caption: for which we have many

02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:57.200
Caption: so hobbies like roller skating wool

02:37:53.759 --> 02:37:58.839
Caption: spinning kira has three spinning wheels

02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:01.520
Caption: yep

02:37:58.839 --> 02:38:03.280
Caption: counting gardening food video games

02:38:01.519 --> 02:38:04.879
Caption: photography music

02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:07.040
Caption: one of our team who isn&#39;t here

02:38:04.879 --> 02:38:09.759
Caption: unfortunately because he&#39;s unwell

02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:09.759
Caption: is a musician

02:38:09.839 --> 02:38:13.519
Caption: so things like nurturing support in a

02:38:12.478 --> 02:38:16.318
Caption: business

02:38:13.519 --> 02:38:17.279
Caption: the idea that someone being late for

02:38:16.319 --> 02:38:20.560
Caption: work

02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:22.959
Caption: in our business doesn&#39;t exist

02:38:20.559 --> 02:38:26.398
Caption: one of the things that i say often to my

02:38:22.959 --> 02:38:28.478
Caption: team is work to your bio rhythms

02:38:26.399 --> 02:38:31.280
Caption: not to what the business needs

02:38:28.478 --> 02:38:33.358
Caption: work to what you need

02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:35.120
Caption: the reason why that change was made is

02:38:33.359 --> 02:38:37.760
Caption: because that we tell ourselves a lot of

02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:39.280
Caption: stories coming from corporate

02:38:37.759 --> 02:38:42.240
Caption: work or previous works that we might

02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:46.399
Caption: have worked how many of you have heard

02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:46.399
Caption: things like leave your life at the door

02:38:47.439 --> 02:38:50.080
Caption: couple people

02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:54.080
Caption: so

02:38:51.439 --> 02:38:56.640
Caption: more hobbies less time and compute

02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:58.879
Caption: suited work environment so each of us

02:38:56.639 --> 02:39:02.159
Caption: obviously work in our own homes

02:38:58.879 --> 02:39:04.000
Caption: or at a cafe or at the beach

02:39:02.160 --> 02:39:06.560
Caption: or in the middle of

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:08.719
Caption: a wonderful forest

02:39:06.559 --> 02:39:10.879
Caption: so uniquely to each team member we all

02:39:08.719 --> 02:39:11.759
Caption: get to work with our best colleagues as

02:39:10.879 --> 02:39:14.398
Caption: well

02:39:11.759 --> 02:39:14.398
Caption: our pets

02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:21.120
Caption: so

02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:24.639
Caption: some challenges for working remote

02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:26.799
Caption: considering boundaries

02:39:24.639 --> 02:39:29.519
Caption: now normally like christina mentioned it

02:39:26.799 --> 02:39:31.438
Caption: this morning in her incredible keynote

02:39:29.519 --> 02:39:33.599
Caption: about the idea that people just sort of

02:39:31.439 --> 02:39:35.439
Caption: check in and go oh can you just have a

02:39:33.599 --> 02:39:37.119
Caption: quick look at that for me

02:39:35.439 --> 02:39:38.399
Caption: just yeah could could you just have a

02:39:37.120 --> 02:39:40.399
Caption: look at this

02:39:38.399 --> 02:39:43.760
Caption: and there&#39;s this constant disruption

02:39:40.399 --> 02:39:43.760
Caption: that happens in an office

02:39:44.559 --> 02:39:48.799
Caption: how that looks online

02:39:46.399 --> 02:39:50.880
Caption: is 27 messages on

02:39:48.799 --> 02:39:53.759
Caption: discord

02:39:50.879 --> 02:39:55.280
Caption: or slack so relearning what that looks

02:39:53.759 --> 02:39:57.919
Caption: like for you

02:39:55.280 --> 02:39:59.439
Caption: when you don&#39;t have an open door policy

02:39:57.919 --> 02:40:00.559
Caption: in your office

02:39:59.439 --> 02:40:02.000
Caption: is then figuring out what your

02:40:00.559 --> 02:40:04.639
Caption: boundaries look like

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.639
Caption: in your home

02:40:05.679 --> 02:40:10.239
Caption: there&#39;s potential for scope slip

02:40:08.799 --> 02:40:12.559
Caption: so because we&#39;re not talking to each

02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:15.919
Caption: other face to face every day

02:40:12.559 --> 02:40:18.239
Caption: our interactions are often online

02:40:15.919 --> 02:40:21.839
Caption: and if things get complicated

02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:21.839
Caption: text on a screen can make it worse

02:40:23.359 --> 02:40:27.200
Caption: has anybody ever heard of

02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:27.200
Caption: procrastinators

02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:33.520
Caption: i&#39;m trying to get it to trend um

02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:34.479
Caption: requested shots when you&#39;re working from

02:40:33.519 --> 02:40:36.478
Caption: home

02:40:34.478 --> 02:40:38.318
Caption: it&#39;s really easy for you to get

02:40:36.478 --> 02:40:41.438
Caption: distracted with all of the things that

02:40:38.319 --> 02:40:42.560
Caption: you&#39;ve got going on in your home

02:40:41.439 --> 02:40:45.120
Caption: for me

02:40:42.559 --> 02:40:47.519
Caption: i have been for the last six weeks

02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:49.120
Caption: trying to film some videos for some

02:40:47.519 --> 02:40:51.199
Caption: courses that we&#39;re doing

02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:54.160
Caption: and instead of filming the videos what i

02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:56.080
Caption: decided in my head was i would clean my

02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:58.640
Caption: entire house

02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:01.639
Caption: reorganize my storage room and paint a

02:40:58.639 --> 02:41:01.639
Caption: wall

02:41:02.478 --> 02:41:04.799
Caption: black

02:41:05.359 --> 02:41:09.359
Caption: so

02:41:06.319 --> 02:41:12.319
Caption: work life and your life can creep into

02:41:09.359 --> 02:41:12.319
Caption: each other&#39;s spaces

02:41:12.639 --> 02:41:16.080
Caption: one of the key things about that is be

02:41:14.639 --> 02:41:18.478
Caption: gentle with yourself don&#39;t judge

02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:20.639
Caption: yourself too harshly for that we all do

02:41:18.478 --> 02:41:20.639
Caption: it

02:41:22.719 --> 02:41:27.519
Caption: one of the other challenges that we have

02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:28.839
Caption: is finding ways to close the distance

02:41:27.519 --> 02:41:31.519
Caption: between the

02:41:28.839 --> 02:41:33.919
Caption: team working in isolation can get really

02:41:31.519 --> 02:41:35.438
Caption: hard and making sure that you&#39;ve got

02:41:33.919 --> 02:41:37.280
Caption: regular check-ins

02:41:35.439 --> 02:41:39.920
Caption: and that having conversations that are

02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:42.080
Caption: not just work conversations are actually

02:41:39.919 --> 02:41:43.919
Caption: really valuable

02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:45.520
Caption: so we&#39;ve all been working together for

02:41:43.919 --> 02:41:48.559
Caption: five years

02:41:45.519 --> 02:41:50.318
Caption: and it took us for the pandemic to

02:41:48.559 --> 02:41:51.919
Caption: happen for us to realize that we didn&#39;t

02:41:50.319 --> 02:41:53.359
Caption: actually really know anything about each

02:41:51.919 --> 02:41:55.200
Caption: other

02:41:53.359 --> 02:41:57.280
Caption: because we are efficient we have all

02:41:55.200 --> 02:42:00.080
Caption: these conversations about the work stuff

02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:02.479
Caption: because that&#39;s what the meeting&#39;s for

02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:04.160
Caption: so we don&#39;t have the water cooler

02:42:02.478 --> 02:42:06.318
Caption: to have those oh what did you get up to

02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:07.759
Caption: on the weekend those conversations are

02:42:06.319 --> 02:42:10.240
Caption: actually really valuable to your

02:42:07.759 --> 02:42:10.240
Caption: workplace

02:42:11.679 --> 02:42:16.478
Caption: distraction guilt who&#39;s watched seven

02:42:13.599 --> 02:42:16.478
Caption: seasons of frasier

02:42:16.639 --> 02:42:20.489
Caption: three people well it&#39;s

02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:22.879
Caption: suddenly feeling more guilty

02:42:20.490 --> 02:42:24.080
Caption: [Laughter]

02:42:22.879 --> 02:42:26.719
Caption: so

02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:29.120
Caption: there is studies to say that

02:42:26.719 --> 02:42:31.438
Caption: people who work from home tend to work

02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:32.959
Caption: more out of guilt

02:42:31.439 --> 02:42:34.560
Caption: because they might have taken a little

02:42:32.959 --> 02:42:38.839
Caption: bit longer for lunch

02:42:34.559 --> 02:42:41.919
Caption: they might have streamed a few too many

02:42:38.839 --> 02:42:43.679
Caption: episodes instead of actually doing work

02:42:41.919 --> 02:42:47.200
Caption: again one of the rules in our business

02:42:43.679 --> 02:42:50.239
Caption: is work to your own flow

02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:52.000
Caption: so long as the job gets done

02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:54.479
Caption: we have two deadlines

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:56.319
Caption: one is the real deadline for the client

02:42:54.478 --> 02:42:59.199
Caption: the other is our internal deadline which

02:42:56.319 --> 02:42:59.200
Caption: is two weeks prior

02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:04.719
Caption: different communication styles

02:43:03.439 --> 02:43:06.800
Caption: with everybody&#39;s different

02:43:04.719 --> 02:43:08.559
Caption: neurodiversities

02:43:06.799 --> 02:43:10.639
Caption: having awareness around the other

02:43:08.559 --> 02:43:12.079
Caption: person&#39;s communication style can be

02:43:10.639 --> 02:43:14.639
Caption: really challenging

02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:17.359
Caption: most of the time we will communicate in

02:43:14.639 --> 02:43:21.358
Caption: the ways that we prefer best

02:43:17.359 --> 02:43:25.120
Caption: i am the worst culprit for this

02:43:21.359 --> 02:43:27.520
Caption: i will often send things to my team at

02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:28.799
Caption: rapid fire hey could you do this hey

02:43:27.519 --> 02:43:30.159
Caption: could you do this hey i forgot about

02:43:28.799 --> 02:43:32.639
Caption: this

02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:35.200
Caption: i am working on it

02:43:32.639 --> 02:43:37.199
Caption: work in progress

02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:39.520
Caption: but remembering that other people

02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:43.919
Caption: receive information differently and

02:43:39.519 --> 02:43:43.919
Caption: trying to accommodate them recognize it

02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:49.120
Caption: so adapting the environment

02:43:46.799 --> 02:43:51.040
Caption: there&#39;s an importance of designated

02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:52.879
Caption: workspace

02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:54.559
Caption: kira very much has two different

02:43:52.879 --> 02:43:56.559
Caption: workspaces so at the beginning of the

02:43:54.559 --> 02:43:58.159
Caption: day she starts in her chair in her

02:43:56.559 --> 02:43:59.759
Caption: office by the end of the day she&#39;s on

02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:01.600
Caption: her couch

02:43:59.759 --> 02:44:03.200
Caption: and

02:44:01.599 --> 02:44:04.478
Caption: so a lot of that is about healthy

02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:06.160
Caption: boundaries

02:44:04.478 --> 02:44:08.318
Caption: for her mind her space and her

02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:09.359
Caption: relationship with work

02:44:08.319 --> 02:44:11.840
Caption: with me

02:44:09.359 --> 02:44:13.680
Caption: this led to a very specific purchase

02:44:11.839 --> 02:44:17.120
Caption: when i bought my house

02:44:13.679 --> 02:44:21.438
Caption: i have an upstairs and a downstairs

02:44:17.120 --> 02:44:24.479
Caption: upstairs is work downstairs is home

02:44:21.439 --> 02:44:24.479
Caption: they do not cross

02:44:24.879 --> 02:44:30.080
Caption: so once i step out of work literally and

02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:32.959
Caption: figuratively

02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:34.879
Caption: i am in my home space mode

02:44:32.959 --> 02:44:36.879
Caption: and that&#39;s very important because one of

02:44:34.879 --> 02:44:39.279
Caption: the people that i work with is also my

02:44:36.879 --> 02:44:39.279
Caption: partner

02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:46.879
Caption: activities for breaks so we have what we

02:44:43.439 --> 02:44:48.479
Caption: call a circuit breaker event for me it&#39;s

02:44:46.879 --> 02:44:50.719
Caption: going to do a food shop in the middle of

02:44:48.478 --> 02:44:52.559
Caption: the day when nobody else is at the shops

02:44:50.719 --> 02:44:55.040
Caption: but it&#39;s to get me outside of my house

02:44:52.559 --> 02:44:57.278
Caption: and outside of outside of my environment

02:44:55.040 --> 02:45:00.719
Caption: to make sure that my brain is not

02:44:57.279 --> 02:45:02.959
Caption: getting too clouded

02:45:00.719 --> 02:45:04.799
Caption: work time and home time

02:45:02.959 --> 02:45:06.799
Caption: is your choice

02:45:04.799 --> 02:45:08.879
Caption: if you stay late you&#39;re choosing that

02:45:06.799 --> 02:45:10.398
Caption: and everything has to be a conscious

02:45:08.879 --> 02:45:12.240
Caption: choice

02:45:10.399 --> 02:45:15.760
Caption: nobody is putting a gun against your

02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:19.040
Caption: head asking you to work late hours

02:45:15.759 --> 02:45:19.040
Caption: certainly not in our business

02:45:19.519 --> 02:45:24.159
Caption: one of the things that i say quite

02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:27.719
Caption: regularly to the team is so long it is

02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:27.719
Caption: as it is healthy

02:45:29.519 --> 02:45:31.919
Caption: meal prep

02:45:30.639 --> 02:45:34.159
Caption: is actually

02:45:31.919 --> 02:45:36.639
Caption: way more important for

02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:38.959
Caption: neurodiverse people

02:45:36.639 --> 02:45:40.239
Caption: um well it&#39;s important for everyone but

02:45:38.959 --> 02:45:42.399
Caption: for people who are neurodiverse

02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:45.680
Caption: sometimes you can get really

02:45:42.399 --> 02:45:49.120
Caption: super hyper fixated on things and then

02:45:45.679 --> 02:45:49.120
Caption: you don&#39;t eat for two days

02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:54.000
Caption: [Laughter]

02:45:51.759 --> 02:45:56.080
Caption: definitely me

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Caption: kira is a recent convert to having

02:45:56.080 --> 02:46:00.240
Caption: lunches she&#39;s very angry about it but

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:02.080
Caption: she loves it really

02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:04.319
Caption: and she&#39;s eating lunches which are more

02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:06.990
Caption: than a cereal box

02:46:04.319 --> 02:46:09.840
Caption: it&#39;s not judgment i love you

02:46:06.990 --> 02:46:11.359
Caption: [Laughter]

02:46:09.839 --> 02:46:13.438
Caption: some of the lessons that we learned from

02:46:11.359 --> 02:46:15.200
Caption: the pandemic was fatigue

02:46:13.439 --> 02:46:17.439
Caption: despite working from home prior to the

02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:19.040
Caption: pandemic the challenges of the team were

02:46:17.439 --> 02:46:22.240
Caption: shared by the team

02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:23.599
Caption: even though we all had unique challenges

02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:26.640
Caption: things like

02:46:23.599 --> 02:46:30.080
Caption: covert fatigue and long covert

02:46:26.639 --> 02:46:30.080
Caption: things that we were not expecting

02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:35.439
Caption: these became things that we shared

02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:37.839
Caption: collectively as a team

02:46:35.439 --> 02:46:41.760
Caption: and it became really important for us to

02:46:37.839 --> 02:46:41.759
Caption: share empathy with the rest of the team

02:46:42.478 --> 02:46:46.398
Caption: managing mental spoons

02:46:44.559 --> 02:46:48.398
Caption: there&#39;s some great blogs out there about

02:46:46.399 --> 02:46:50.399
Caption: mental spoons and having how many spoons

02:46:48.399 --> 02:46:52.240
Caption: you have for your day

02:46:50.399 --> 02:46:56.160
Caption: some days you have less spoons because

02:46:52.240 --> 02:46:57.600
Caption: you&#39;re borrowed from next week&#39;s spoons

02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:59.520
Caption: currently we&#39;re working towards a

02:46:57.599 --> 02:47:01.358
Caption: four-day week and we&#39;re doing this for

02:46:59.519 --> 02:47:02.799
Caption: mental health reasons

02:47:01.359 --> 02:47:03.760
Caption: we realize

02:47:02.799 --> 02:47:06.719
Caption: that

02:47:03.759 --> 02:47:08.799
Caption: the last two years have been hard

02:47:06.719 --> 02:47:10.000
Caption: and it&#39;s four day work week with a five

02:47:08.799 --> 02:47:11.599
Caption: day pay

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:14.959
Caption: to clarify

02:47:11.599 --> 02:47:14.959
Caption: i&#39;m not undercutting anybody

02:47:15.839 --> 02:47:22.478
Caption: the business values are also imperative

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:23.919
Caption: they have been from day one for me

02:47:22.478 --> 02:47:25.839
Caption: when i walked out of my previous

02:47:23.919 --> 02:47:28.799
Caption: business it was because there was a

02:47:25.839 --> 02:47:31.120
Caption: misalignment with values

02:47:28.799 --> 02:47:33.438
Caption: and i swore that i would make a business

02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:35.600
Caption: that was aligned with my values always

02:47:33.439 --> 02:47:37.600
Caption: even as they evolve

02:47:35.599 --> 02:47:40.239
Caption: the people in our business

02:47:37.599 --> 02:47:42.478
Caption: are aligned with our values our clients

02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:45.520
Caption: are aligned with our values

02:47:42.478 --> 02:47:49.639
Caption: we have fired clients this year

02:47:45.519 --> 02:47:49.639
Caption: for not being aligned with our values

02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:53.759
Caption: i want to have a bit of a conversation

02:47:52.879 --> 02:47:57.040
Caption: about

02:47:53.759 --> 02:47:57.040
Caption: the word over achieving

02:47:58.319 --> 02:48:03.919
Caption: say hello to my toxic

02:48:00.839 --> 02:48:06.559
Caption: relationship it&#39;s with this word

02:48:03.919 --> 02:48:09.599
Caption: we used to highlight it as really great

02:48:06.559 --> 02:48:12.079
Caption: oh it&#39;s so great such an overachiever

02:48:09.599 --> 02:48:14.000
Caption: with pride

02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:16.560
Caption: and then our newest team member michael

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:17.919
Caption: who&#39;s from melbourne joined

02:48:16.559 --> 02:48:20.398
Caption: and

02:48:17.919 --> 02:48:24.398
Caption: i remember him saying to me oh i want to

02:48:20.399 --> 02:48:26.240
Caption: be just like vern and just like derek

02:48:24.399 --> 02:48:28.800
Caption: two of our highest overachievers in our

02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:30.799
Caption: business

02:48:28.799 --> 02:48:32.879
Caption: and i realized that our toxic

02:48:30.799 --> 02:48:35.278
Caption: relationship with that word

02:48:32.879 --> 02:48:38.000
Caption: sets the tone for anybody new coming

02:48:35.279 --> 02:48:38.000
Caption: into our business

02:48:38.879 --> 02:48:44.279
Caption: have a think about what you&#39;re setting

02:48:40.399 --> 02:48:44.279
Caption: the tone for new people

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:51.839
Caption: so i&#39;ve probably run under time because

02:48:48.399 --> 02:48:51.840
Caption: i talk very quickly

02:48:52.799 --> 02:48:56.398
Caption: yeah um

02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:57.839
Caption: but my final notes is you might have

02:48:56.399 --> 02:48:59.760
Caption: noticed that i&#39;ve talked about work

02:48:57.839 --> 02:49:02.719
Caption: environment and beliefs and structural

02:48:59.759 --> 02:49:04.240
Caption: workplace and pitfalls the remote work

02:49:02.719 --> 02:49:05.200
Caption: but ultimately the core thing is

02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:06.799
Caption: actually

02:49:05.200 --> 02:49:08.799
Caption: about productivity

02:49:06.799 --> 02:49:11.519
Caption: is mental health and wellness and the

02:49:08.799 --> 02:49:14.240
Caption: security of the team

02:49:11.519 --> 02:49:15.759
Caption: when the pandemic kicked off one of the

02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:18.080
Caption: decisions that i made

02:49:15.759 --> 02:49:20.000
Caption: was to employ my team they were all

02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:24.399

02:49:34.959 --> 02:49:39.438

02:49:41.279 --> 02:49:45.040
Caption: decisions

02:49:42.799 --> 02:49:47.200

Caption: important thing

02:49:57.359 --> 02:50:01.840

Caption: with us having that security it also

02:50:10.879 --> 02:50:16.080
Caption: meant that our clients have that

02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:16.080

02:51:47.439 --> 02:51:52.399
Caption: considered catching up at you know

02:51:49.679 --> 02:51:55.040
Caption: regular times very valuable um

02:51:52.399 --> 02:51:58.080
Caption: so um have you guys considered catching

02:51:55.040 --> 02:51:59.839
Caption: up let&#39;s say every you know two three

02:51:58.080 --> 02:52:02.160
Caption: months and at the place and work

02:51:59.839 --> 02:52:04.080
Caption: together doing a vocation type of thing

02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:05.200
Caption: so so two of our team work on the east

02:52:04.080 --> 02:52:06.240
Caption: coast

02:52:05.200 --> 02:52:07.839
Caption: yep

02:52:06.240 --> 02:52:10.560
Caption: at the moment i can&#39;t afford to fly them

02:52:07.839 --> 02:52:12.959
Caption: over every two weeks

02:52:10.559 --> 02:52:14.398
Caption: um i&#39;ve i would love that

02:52:12.959 --> 02:52:16.399
Caption: i think two weeks would be a big ass

02:52:14.399 --> 02:52:17.359
Caption: because everybody&#39;s got families and

02:52:16.399 --> 02:52:20.399
Caption: life

02:52:17.359 --> 02:52:22.160
Caption: stuff as well to work around um it is an

02:52:20.399 --> 02:52:24.319
Caption: important thing that&#39;s been flagged as

02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:26.399
Caption: something that we would like to do more

02:52:24.319 --> 02:52:28.879
Caption: often absolutely

02:52:26.399 --> 02:52:30.959
Caption: excuses like ddd perth it&#39;s a great

02:52:28.879 --> 02:52:31.839
Caption: excuse for that

02:52:30.959 --> 02:52:33.040
Caption: um

02:52:31.839 --> 02:52:36.080
Caption: i don&#39;t know if that answers your

02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:36.080
Caption: question yes

02:52:36.399 --> 02:52:40.959
Caption: i do think it&#39;s important um if you have

02:52:39.359 --> 02:52:42.720
Caption: a local team

02:52:40.959 --> 02:52:45.679
Caption: catching up with them

02:52:42.719 --> 02:52:47.759
Caption: um i catch up with all of my team once a

02:52:45.679 --> 02:52:50.160
Caption: week online

02:52:47.759 --> 02:52:51.679
Caption: and it is it is it has been enough for

02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:53.040
Caption: the last five years

02:52:51.679 --> 02:52:54.839
Caption: do you guys wanna

02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:57.679
Caption: can i add something yeah i i would

02:52:54.839 --> 02:53:01.200
Caption: recommend considering this to everyone

02:52:57.679 --> 02:53:02.239
Caption: so um i was working in europe a lot and

02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:05.680
Caption: um

02:53:02.240 --> 02:53:08.479
Caption: i flew over from from another country to

02:53:05.679 --> 02:53:10.799
Caption: meet the team every four to six weeks

02:53:08.478 --> 02:53:14.318
Caption: because of this uh even before the

02:53:10.799 --> 02:53:15.919
Caption: pandemic uh there was uh for myself very

02:53:14.319 --> 02:53:17.439
Caption: important uh

02:53:15.919 --> 02:53:19.599
Caption: you know to catch up and have this chit

02:53:17.439 --> 02:53:22.000
Caption: chats and what what you&#39;ve mentioned and

02:53:19.599 --> 02:53:24.559
Caption: i can only you know recommend doing this

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:26.399
Caption: it&#39;s what you lose at the the costs you

02:53:24.559 --> 02:53:29.759
Caption: lose basically for office you should

02:53:26.399 --> 02:53:31.840
Caption: spend in yes kind of events that&#39;s um so

02:53:29.759 --> 02:53:33.759
Caption: what so what we invested chose to invest

02:53:31.839 --> 02:53:34.719
Caption: in was training at the time

02:53:33.759 --> 02:53:35.839
Caption: um

02:53:34.719 --> 02:53:38.000
Caption: and

02:53:35.839 --> 02:53:39.839
Caption: i think one of the things i have always

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:41.599
Caption: encouraged from the team is that they

02:53:39.839 --> 02:53:43.599
Caption: engage in community

02:53:41.599 --> 02:53:46.159
Caption: that they find their own local community

02:53:43.599 --> 02:53:48.318
Caption: and find their own peers

02:53:46.160 --> 02:53:50.240
Caption: because we don&#39;t know what the pandemic

02:53:48.319 --> 02:53:52.399
Caption: will look like in the future we might go

02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:53.919
Caption: into another lockdown

02:53:52.399 --> 02:53:56.399
Caption: the like

02:53:53.919 --> 02:53:57.919
Caption: the concern i have is if we go into

02:53:56.399 --> 02:53:59.680
Caption: another lockdown then how do we maintain

02:53:57.919 --> 02:54:01.599
Caption: that how do we support that

02:53:59.679 --> 02:54:04.160
Caption: i&#39;d actually agree with that if your

02:54:01.599 --> 02:54:06.159
Caption: team is remote at least find a tribe and

02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:08.240
Caption: that&#39;s actually why i&#39;m here at ddd

02:54:06.160 --> 02:54:10.160
Caption: perth because i&#39;m working remotely in a

02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:11.839
Caption: team of one and i get to connect with

02:54:10.160 --> 02:54:15.439
Caption: amazing people like ming who invited me

02:54:11.839 --> 02:54:15.438
Caption: here um another question

02:54:15.759 --> 02:54:20.478
Caption: um hi if you feel comfortable can you

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:22.559
Caption: expand a little bit on the toxic

02:54:20.478 --> 02:54:24.799
Caption: relationship with overachieving

02:54:22.559 --> 02:54:27.119
Caption: how people might recognize that in

02:54:24.799 --> 02:54:29.519
Caption: themselves potentially

02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:31.040
Caption: i don&#39;t know i think this week has been

02:54:29.519 --> 02:54:33.119
Caption: a good example

02:54:31.040 --> 02:54:34.799
Caption: [Laughter]

02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:37.839
Caption: um

02:54:34.799 --> 02:54:41.599
Caption: i think if you if so

02:54:37.839 --> 02:54:44.719
Caption: specifically to people who work remote

02:54:41.599 --> 02:54:47.199
Caption: you have on average two to four hours

02:54:44.719 --> 02:54:48.959
Caption: that are actually productive

02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:52.240
Caption: productive work

02:54:48.959 --> 02:54:52.479
Caption: the rest of it is spinning wheels

02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:53.839
Caption: um

02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:56.240
Caption: [Music]

02:54:53.839 --> 02:54:59.839
Caption: and i think if you are pushing yourself

02:54:56.240 --> 02:54:59.839
Caption: or drinking lots of red bull

02:55:00.080 --> 02:55:03.439
Caption: caffeine intake&#39;s probably a good

02:55:01.359 --> 02:55:05.840
Caption: indicator um

02:55:03.439 --> 02:55:07.120
Caption: missing meals is another one

02:55:05.839 --> 02:55:08.318
Caption: um

02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:11.200
Caption: for me

02:55:08.319 --> 02:55:13.840
Caption: i&#39;m very lucky in the fact that i have a

02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:16.080
Caption: great relationship where my partner is

02:55:13.839 --> 02:55:18.559
Caption: got very healthy boundaries with work

02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:20.879
Caption: and home life

02:55:18.559 --> 02:55:23.040
Caption: and so a lot of that dictates my

02:55:20.879 --> 02:55:25.599
Caption: relationship with that when i was single

02:55:23.040 --> 02:55:28.000
Caption: i can guarantee you i would work 14

02:55:25.599 --> 02:55:31.119
Caption: hours because sometimes

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:32.639
Caption: i don&#39;t have a perception of time

02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:34.479
Caption: and i think

02:55:32.639 --> 02:55:36.559
Caption: speaking to the neurodiversity side of

02:55:34.478 --> 02:55:39.599
Caption: things

02:55:36.559 --> 02:55:41.599
Caption: certainly this week i don&#39;t always know

02:55:39.599 --> 02:55:43.679
Caption: what my max

02:55:41.599 --> 02:55:46.318
Caption: output looks like

02:55:43.679 --> 02:55:47.759
Caption: and it&#39;s taking

02:55:46.319 --> 02:55:48.800
Caption: it&#39;s taken me probably five years to

02:55:47.759 --> 02:55:51.839
Caption: figure out

02:55:48.799 --> 02:55:53.839
Caption: you know maybe do too much

02:55:51.839 --> 02:55:56.799
Caption: i think also being neuro-diverse there&#39;s

02:55:53.839 --> 02:55:59.279
Caption: something called delay aversion so you

02:55:56.799 --> 02:56:01.040
Caption: procrastinate and then you freak out and

02:55:59.279 --> 02:56:02.479
Caption: you rush to the finish but you do it

02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:04.639
Caption: successfully and that gives you a

02:56:02.478 --> 02:56:07.358
Caption: dopamine reward and then you repeat the

02:56:04.639 --> 02:56:10.358
Caption: behavior and it&#39;s self um

02:56:07.359 --> 02:56:10.359
Caption: fulfilling

02:56:14.319 --> 02:56:17.439
Caption: i&#39;m getting better at it

02:56:17.839 --> 02:56:21.919
Caption: i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ve learned that lesson

02:56:19.759 --> 02:56:23.519
Caption: yet because i&#39;m still saying yes to lots

02:56:21.919 --> 02:56:25.120
Caption: of things

02:56:23.519 --> 02:56:27.599
Caption: i mean great

02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:29.679
Caption: um it&#39;s not so much a question more on

02:56:27.599 --> 02:56:31.839
Caption: observation i think like with the

02:56:29.679 --> 02:56:34.398
Caption: toxic over-achieving uh linking

02:56:31.839 --> 02:56:35.919
Caption: self-worth to achievements as well yeah

02:56:34.399 --> 02:56:38.560
Caption: um so

02:56:35.919 --> 02:56:41.120
Caption: not being satisfied with an outcome if

02:56:38.559 --> 02:56:42.639
Caption: there&#39;s the perception of failure you

02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:44.639
Caption: then look at yourself as a failure as

02:56:42.639 --> 02:56:46.239
Caption: opposed to looking at the activity has

02:56:44.639 --> 02:56:49.040
Caption: failed um

02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:52.000
Caption: yeah so yeah that can be a big thing i

02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:54.959
Caption: yeah so so just to add to that so with

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:57.279
Caption: the ptsd side of things a lot of my

02:56:54.959 --> 02:56:59.519
Caption: internal dialogue is around total

02:56:57.279 --> 02:57:00.399
Caption: catastrophic failure

02:56:59.519 --> 02:57:02.879
Caption: um

02:57:00.399 --> 02:57:05.200
Caption: and even this week like little things

02:57:02.879 --> 02:57:07.040
Caption: have gone wrong this week

02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:08.399

Caption: week for our current workload for our

Caption: community engagement and whether or not

02:58:17.919 --> 02:58:22.398

02:58:19.439 --> 02:58:22.399
Caption: with their community

02:58:22.559 --> 02:58:27.759

Caption: cost management

02:58:28.160 --> 02:58:32.959
Caption: chargeable for my clients is probably a

02:58:30.559 --> 02:58:36.159
Caption: good start

02:58:32.959 --> 02:58:38.160
Caption: because i don&#39;t charge enough um

02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:40.959
Caption: yeah like the costs

02:58:38.160 --> 02:58:43.279
Caption: and certainly employing people

02:58:40.959 --> 02:58:45.279
Caption: and coming out of being a sole trader

02:58:43.279 --> 02:58:46.319
Caption: into a company

02:58:45.279 --> 02:58:49.200
Caption: this

02:58:46.319 --> 02:58:51.520
Caption: my role has changed

02:58:49.200 --> 02:58:52.240
Caption: my role in my own business has changed

02:58:51.519 --> 02:58:56.959
Caption: from

02:58:52.240 --> 02:58:59.359
Caption: lead gen to then being okay i&#39;m like my

02:58:56.959 --> 02:59:01.919
Caption: my days are staring at my bank account

02:58:59.359 --> 02:59:04.640
Caption: and making sure that i can afford

02:59:01.919 --> 02:59:07.919
Caption: to operate in the ways that we operate

02:59:04.639 --> 02:59:09.679
Caption: i get zero joy from that

02:59:07.919 --> 02:59:11.359
Caption: the joy i actually get from is is

02:59:09.679 --> 02:59:12.799
Caption: working with my clients

02:59:11.359 --> 02:59:13.840
Caption: so

02:59:12.799 --> 02:59:15.919
Caption: uh

02:59:13.839 --> 02:59:17.679
Caption: have we got a plan the plan is currently

02:59:15.919 --> 02:59:19.599
Caption: we have some targets to hit for the

02:59:17.679 --> 02:59:20.478
Caption: business so we can financially support

02:59:19.599 --> 02:59:23.438
Caption: it

02:59:20.478 --> 02:59:25.839
Caption: um and then when we start to implement

02:59:23.439 --> 02:59:28.319
Caption: it we&#39;re going to do a trial just to get

02:59:25.839 --> 02:59:30.639
Caption: our rhythms right um but you&#39;re quite

02:59:28.319 --> 02:59:32.879
Caption: right like the the

02:59:30.639 --> 02:59:34.639
Caption: the amount of work that we do as as

02:59:32.879 --> 02:59:35.839
Caption: like we&#39;re a small team with a team of

02:59:34.639 --> 02:59:38.239
Caption: six

02:59:35.839 --> 02:59:40.000
Caption: the amount of work that we do is um

02:59:38.240 --> 02:59:42.799
Caption: overwhelming

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:45.439
Caption: kira wrote a really great blog that&#39;s on

02:59:42.799 --> 02:59:47.919
Caption: our website um which was something along

02:59:45.439 --> 02:59:49.840
Caption: the what the ever-loving bleep have i

02:59:47.919 --> 02:59:52.080
Caption: got have i gotten in myself into and i

02:59:49.839 --> 02:59:54.799
Caption: think it was like a month into her job

02:59:52.080 --> 02:59:57.200
Caption: a week in a week into the business

02:59:54.799 --> 02:59:59.040
Caption: yeah um and she&#39;s now been in the

02:59:57.200 --> 03:00:02.319
Caption: business for a year and a half i think

02:59:59.040 --> 03:00:04.399
Caption: yeah um and so she sort of reflected on

03:00:02.319 --> 03:00:08.319
Caption: all of the things that we do and she was

03:00:04.399 --> 03:00:08.319
Caption: like oh i had no idea what you guys did

03:00:09.200 --> 03:00:12.879
Caption: could i also add i think um what i&#39;ve

03:00:11.439 --> 03:00:15.840
Caption: learned about you is you like to help

03:00:12.879 --> 03:00:16.719
Caption: people yeah and it&#39;s really hard to say

03:00:15.839 --> 03:00:18.398
Caption: nice

03:00:16.719 --> 03:00:20.318
Caption: and you have to retrain the way instead

03:00:18.399 --> 03:00:21.840
Caption: of saying no about what help you can

03:00:20.319 --> 03:00:23.520
Caption: give instead of actually taking it on

03:00:21.839 --> 03:00:25.279
Caption: board and and

03:00:23.519 --> 03:00:27.278
Caption: just getting it all done because you

03:00:25.279 --> 03:00:28.959
Caption: achieve so much that you need to

03:00:27.279 --> 03:00:31.040
Caption: actually temper that with um

03:00:28.959 --> 03:00:32.879
Caption: prioritizing the right tasks i i

03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:35.120
Caption: recently did a

03:00:32.879 --> 03:00:38.240
Caption: money mindset training and one of the

03:00:35.120 --> 03:00:41.600
Caption: things that came out of that was um i i

03:00:38.240 --> 03:00:44.240
Caption: have a nurturer money mindset which

03:00:41.599 --> 03:00:47.679
Caption: means that i want to help everyone

03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:50.000
Caption: um except for myself and

03:00:47.679 --> 03:00:51.358
Caption: um so i&#39;d like i do have some boundaries

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:53.599
Caption: that i&#39;ve put in place that i&#39;ve learned

03:00:51.359 --> 03:00:56.240
Caption: which is like with my community

03:00:53.599 --> 03:00:57.599
Caption: engagement stuff limiting to 10 of my

03:00:56.240 --> 03:00:59.040
Caption: time

03:00:57.599 --> 03:01:00.398
Caption: um

03:00:59.040 --> 03:01:02.080
Caption: but yeah so

03:01:00.399 --> 03:01:03.120
Caption: starting to put boundaries in place and

03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:04.479
Caption: stuff like that

03:01:03.120 --> 03:01:06.639
Caption: so

03:01:04.478 --> 03:01:09.278
Caption: with the gradual move towards remote

03:01:06.639 --> 03:01:11.358
Caption: work for more and more businesses a lot

03:01:09.279 --> 03:01:13.520
Caption: of companies seem to have trust issues

03:01:11.359 --> 03:01:15.200
Caption: in their management staff trusting their

03:01:13.519 --> 03:01:17.919
Caption: actual staff who do the processing the

03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:20.160
Caption: actual work and do the output so do you

03:01:17.919 --> 03:01:21.438
Caption: have any advice to help those people who

03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:24.080
Caption: do have small businesses that are

03:01:21.439 --> 03:01:26.399
Caption: looking at moving to remote for how to

03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:29.200
Caption: develop that trust relationship as an

03:01:26.399 --> 03:01:30.800
Caption: employer and also for the employees to

03:01:29.200 --> 03:01:32.319
Caption: develop a trust relationship with them

03:01:30.799 --> 03:01:34.000
Caption: because don&#39;t forget

03:01:32.319 --> 03:01:36.000
Caption: if you don&#39;t trust your manager and

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:37.839
Caption: you&#39;re not in there every day

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:39.919
Caption: it&#39;s going to go horribly wrong so any

03:01:37.839 --> 03:01:43.358
Caption: advice for businesses looking to do that

03:01:39.919 --> 03:01:45.200
Caption: throw me a curveball sarah yeah

03:01:43.359 --> 03:01:46.160
Caption: oh yeah thanks um

03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:49.439
Caption: um

03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:52.399
Caption: okay so a couple of things one is if

03:01:49.439 --> 03:01:57.120
Caption: employers managers whoever are concerned

03:01:52.399 --> 03:01:59.680
Caption: that their team are not doing their job

03:01:57.120 --> 03:02:02.080
Caption: hire different people

03:01:59.679 --> 03:02:04.318
Caption: hire people that you trust if you don&#39;t

03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:05.599
Caption: hire people that you don&#39;t trust what

03:02:04.319 --> 03:02:07.439
Caption: are you doing

03:02:05.599 --> 03:02:09.199
Caption: and the other way around if you&#39;re

03:02:07.439 --> 03:02:10.800
Caption: looking to find the right team to work

03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:12.719
Caption: in actually figure that out first

03:02:10.799 --> 03:02:14.240
Caption: because yeah it is all too common so

03:02:12.719 --> 03:02:15.438
Caption: that kind of comes back to value

03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:16.799
Caption: alignment

03:02:15.439 --> 03:02:19.359
Caption: um

03:02:16.799 --> 03:02:21.200
Caption: so things like for us

03:02:19.359 --> 03:02:22.560
Caption: the question that i will always ask my

03:02:21.200 --> 03:02:25.839
Caption: team when they&#39;re struggling with

03:02:22.559 --> 03:02:28.559
Caption: something is how can i support you

03:02:25.839 --> 03:02:30.398
Caption: it&#39;s never why didn&#39;t you do this

03:02:28.559 --> 03:02:33.199
Caption: because that&#39;s always going to come back

03:02:30.399 --> 03:02:35.439
Caption: with a point of aggression that&#39;s never

03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:36.640
Caption: that&#39;s never going to be a helpful

03:02:35.439 --> 03:02:38.000
Caption: question

03:02:36.639 --> 03:02:40.478
Caption: um

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:42.240
Caption: but i&#39;ve also managed people for over 20

03:02:40.478 --> 03:02:44.639
Caption: years so

03:02:42.240 --> 03:02:44.640
Caption: kyra

03:02:49.759 --> 03:02:52.719
Caption: um

03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:54.080
Caption: so

03:02:52.719 --> 03:02:56.000
Caption: ming can obviously really answer that

03:02:54.080 --> 03:02:58.560
Caption: from an employer&#39;s point of view but for

03:02:56.000 --> 03:03:01.679
Caption: the people who work for her the way that

03:02:58.559 --> 03:03:03.438
Caption: that pans out for us is that

03:03:01.679 --> 03:03:05.358
Caption: i think the most important takeaway for

03:03:03.439 --> 03:03:06.720
Caption: that for employers is don&#39;t dick over

03:03:05.359 --> 03:03:07.680
Caption: your staff

03:03:06.719 --> 03:03:09.040
Caption: because

03:03:07.679 --> 03:03:11.919
Caption: i&#39;ve been in really toxic work

03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:14.000
Caption: environments and i now work for me and i

03:03:11.919 --> 03:03:16.240
Caption: have been in situations where

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:18.240
Caption: they will say oh great come to us are

03:03:16.240 --> 03:03:19.439
Caption: you okay is everything all right tell us

03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:21.759
Caption: when you have problems and then we&#39;ll

03:03:19.439 --> 03:03:22.640
Caption: use that as an excuse to screw you every

03:03:21.759 --> 03:03:24.080
Caption: time

03:03:22.639 --> 03:03:26.879
Caption: whereas

03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:29.520
Caption: what i&#39;m finding difficult to relax into

03:03:26.879 --> 03:03:31.679
Caption: is the fact that i can actually have a

03:03:29.519 --> 03:03:33.759
Caption: shitty day or have a problem or have

03:03:31.679 --> 03:03:35.040
Caption: something and my boss isn&#39;t trying to

03:03:33.759 --> 03:03:37.599
Caption: screw me

03:03:35.040 --> 03:03:40.160
Caption: so i&#39;ll go to ming and she&#39;ll go okay

03:03:37.599 --> 03:03:42.080
Caption: that&#39;s fine let&#39;s let&#39;s do something

03:03:40.160 --> 03:03:43.919
Caption: else today let&#39;s find something else

03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:45.759
Caption: that you can manage or let&#39;s put that on

03:03:43.919 --> 03:03:47.679
Caption: the back burner and

03:03:45.759 --> 03:03:48.719
Caption: you need to take a day

03:03:47.679 --> 03:03:50.959
Caption: exactly

03:03:48.719 --> 03:03:52.559
Caption: the amount of times i&#39;ve said i&#39;m sick

03:03:50.959 --> 03:03:54.240
Caption: and just don&#39;t expect too much from me

03:03:52.559 --> 03:03:57.199
Caption: today and she&#39;s like right you&#39;re going

03:03:54.240 --> 03:03:59.120
Caption: to bed now i&#39;m logging you off

03:03:57.200 --> 03:04:00.879
Caption: it&#39;s just it&#39;s very different for an

03:03:59.120 --> 03:04:03.279
Caption: employee i think to relax into that

03:04:00.879 --> 03:04:06.639
Caption: space i also kind of want to point out

03:04:03.279 --> 03:04:08.560
Caption: that if you are treating your employees

03:04:06.639 --> 03:04:11.040
Caption: like their criminals

03:04:08.559 --> 03:04:13.919
Caption: it makes them very kidnappable for a

04:59:55.439 --> 04:59:58.080
Caption: end of the reporting cycle or whatever

04:59:56.798 --> 05:00:00.320
Caption: it might be

04:59:58.080 --> 05:00:01.839
Caption: it basically means that there have been

05:00:00.320 --> 05:00:03.599
Caption: assumptions that have gone wrong but

05:00:01.839 --> 05:00:05.679
Caption: they&#39;ve been proven to be wrong

05:00:03.599 --> 05:00:07.519
Caption: someone has assumed that this isn&#39;t part

05:00:05.679 --> 05:00:09.839
Caption: of their role and you have assumed that

05:00:07.519 --> 05:00:09.839
Caption: it is

05:00:12.080 --> 05:00:16.560
Caption: you cannot assume

05:00:14.560 --> 05:00:17.599
Caption: that people understand what their role

05:00:16.560 --> 05:00:19.361
Caption: is

05:00:17.599 --> 05:00:21.759
Caption: you cannot assume that people&#39;s

05:00:19.359 --> 05:00:22.876
Caption: interpretation of their role is the same

05:00:21.759 --> 05:00:25.039
Caption: as yours

05:00:22.878 --> 05:00:27.361
Caption: this is especially true for multi-vendor

05:00:25.039 --> 05:00:30.078
Caption: teams and teams where you have a mix of

05:00:27.359 --> 05:00:31.759
Caption: operational project and product people

05:00:30.080 --> 05:00:33.279
Caption: we each have a different lens that we

05:00:31.759 --> 05:00:34.876
Caption: bring into what our role actually means

05:00:33.279 --> 05:00:37.759
Caption: and what it means to work and how they

05:00:34.878 --> 05:00:39.281
Caption: interact with each other

05:00:37.759 --> 05:00:40.160
Caption: and it&#39;s incredibly important that we

05:00:39.279 --> 05:00:42.558
Caption: actually

05:00:40.160 --> 05:00:44.160
Caption: bring ourselves together to get that

05:00:42.560 --> 05:00:48.441
Caption: common understanding that common clarity

05:00:44.160 --> 05:00:48.439
Caption: on how we&#39;ll work together today

05:00:51.279 --> 05:00:56.398
Caption: what you need to do is first steps do we

05:00:54.240 --> 05:00:57.201
Caption: all actually agree on what our problem

05:00:56.400 --> 05:00:58.878
Caption: is

05:00:57.199 --> 05:01:00.478
Caption: do we understand what we&#39;re trying to

05:00:58.878 --> 05:01:02.638
Caption: solve why are we even here in the first

05:01:00.480 --> 05:01:04.638
Caption: place

05:01:02.638 --> 05:01:06.400
Caption: when you have a clarity on that then you

05:01:04.638 --> 05:01:08.160
Caption: can do your visioning what&#39;s that

05:01:06.400 --> 05:01:09.599
Caption: desired outcome where are we heading to

05:01:08.160 --> 05:01:12.320
Caption: what do we want to be

05:01:09.599 --> 05:01:14.400
Caption: in three six months years time what are

05:01:12.320 --> 05:01:15.679
Caption: we trying to get to

05:01:14.400 --> 05:01:17.599
Caption: from there

05:01:15.679 --> 05:01:18.876
Caption: you have to understand what are the

05:01:17.599 --> 05:01:20.480
Caption: things that you actually need to do

05:01:18.878 --> 05:01:22.718
Caption: forget your project methodology for a

05:01:20.480 --> 05:01:24.000
Caption: moment but what do you actually need to

05:01:22.718 --> 05:01:26.080
Caption: get done

05:01:24.000 --> 05:01:27.199
Caption: what&#39;s your value chain

05:01:26.080 --> 05:01:30.439
Caption: that&#39;s going to get you to where you

05:01:27.199 --> 05:01:30.439
Caption: want to go

05:01:30.560 --> 05:01:33.679
Caption: when you have that value chain

05:01:32.080 --> 05:01:35.279
Caption: understood and broken down as much as

05:01:33.679 --> 05:01:37.119
Caption: you possibly can to get your best

05:01:35.279 --> 05:01:39.039
Caption: estimates from here you can have a look

05:01:37.119 --> 05:01:41.119
Caption: around and think and talk about the kind

05:01:39.039 --> 05:01:43.519
Caption: of project methodology you think is

05:01:41.119 --> 05:01:45.519
Caption: going to suit your project the best

05:01:43.519 --> 05:01:47.439
Caption: what roles are available to you and then

05:01:45.519 --> 05:01:50.240
Caption: you can agree and assign those roles and

05:01:47.439 --> 05:01:50.240
Caption: responsibilities

05:01:51.279 --> 05:01:55.199
Caption: what&#39;s within your remit

05:01:53.359 --> 05:01:57.199
Caption: today

05:01:55.199 --> 05:01:58.558
Caption: now you might be talking to me and like

05:01:57.199 --> 05:01:59.919
Caption: might be thinking in your head we&#39;ve

05:01:58.560 --> 05:02:01.521
Caption: done this and there&#39;s still things that

05:01:59.919 --> 05:02:02.638
Caption: come up that we don&#39;t know who it

05:02:01.519 --> 05:02:04.000
Caption: belongs to

05:02:02.638 --> 05:02:05.441
Caption: or maybe you&#39;re trying you&#39;re thinking

05:02:04.000 --> 05:02:07.599
Caption: about well the product that we&#39;re

05:02:05.439 --> 05:02:09.679
Caption: working on doesn&#39;t actually have a very

05:02:07.599 --> 05:02:11.199
Caption: clearly defined outcome

05:02:09.679 --> 05:02:12.560
Caption: well it&#39;s true we don&#39;t have a crystal

05:02:11.199 --> 05:02:14.716
Caption: ball and we don&#39;t

05:02:12.560 --> 05:02:17.041
Caption: know always what&#39;s going to come up and

05:02:14.718 --> 05:02:20.240
Caption: potentially derail us on our journey to

05:02:17.039 --> 05:02:21.599
Caption: our end vision or our end goal

05:02:20.240 --> 05:02:22.798
Caption: this is where you come together as a

05:02:21.599 --> 05:02:24.839
Caption: team and you actually talk about the

05:02:22.798 --> 05:02:27.601
Caption: roles that are available to you and your

05:02:24.839 --> 05:02:28.876
Caption: team what are your experiences in

05:02:27.599 --> 05:02:30.957
Caption: previous projects in previous

05:02:28.878 --> 05:02:32.718
Caption: organizations how have you worked with a

05:02:30.957 --> 05:02:35.759
Caption: project sponsor previously

05:02:32.718 --> 05:02:37.361
Caption: what do you expect your tester to do

05:02:35.759 --> 05:02:39.199
Caption: are there some roles or some

05:02:37.359 --> 05:02:40.876
Caption: responsibilities i should say that your

05:02:39.199 --> 05:02:43.039
Caption: change manager would traditionally be

05:02:40.878 --> 05:02:44.798
Caption: responsible for but in this particular

05:02:43.039 --> 05:02:47.119
Caption: project it makes more sense for your ba

05:02:44.798 --> 05:02:49.681
Caption: to do that

05:02:47.119 --> 05:02:51.599
Caption: what&#39;s within your remit today

05:02:49.679 --> 05:02:53.359
Caption: what&#39;s the social contract that you&#39;re

05:02:51.599 --> 05:02:55.199
Caption: forming

05:02:53.359 --> 05:02:57.439
Caption: someone clearly did not think it was

05:02:55.199 --> 05:02:59.119
Caption: their role to clear the path before

05:02:57.439 --> 05:03:02.080
Caption: painting and i don&#39;t think it led to a

05:02:59.119 --> 05:03:02.080
Caption: remarkable outcome

05:03:03.359 --> 05:03:07.359
Caption: in a game of he said she said you&#39;re

05:03:05.519 --> 05:03:09.599
Caption: going to want to keep your receipts i

05:03:07.359 --> 05:03:11.759
Caption: don&#39;t care how i just make sure that you

05:03:09.599 --> 05:03:11.759
Caption: do

05:03:13.039 --> 05:03:16.238
Caption: number two

05:03:14.560 --> 05:03:18.638
Caption: we don&#39;t do things that way have you

05:03:16.240 --> 05:03:19.759
Caption: heard this before you&#39;ve come in new to

05:03:18.638 --> 05:03:21.919
Caption: the team and you&#39;ve tried to like

05:03:19.759 --> 05:03:23.919
Caption: introduce a new way of working sorry

05:03:21.919 --> 05:03:25.519
Caption: mate you must be a bit new here we don&#39;t

05:03:23.919 --> 05:03:28.957
Caption: really do things that way things have

05:03:25.519 --> 05:03:28.957
Caption: been working fine until you came along

05:03:30.080 --> 05:03:33.919
Caption: there&#39;s not enough angry emojis in there

05:03:31.439 --> 05:03:36.400
Caption: but i love it

05:03:33.919 --> 05:03:38.080
Caption: it can be pretty tricky to balance

05:03:36.400 --> 05:03:39.519
Caption: chaos and order

05:03:38.080 --> 05:03:40.798
Caption: particularly when you&#39;re trying to

05:03:39.519 --> 05:03:42.320
Caption: manage the different people&#39;s

05:03:40.798 --> 05:03:44.320
Caption: expectations and their different comfort

05:03:42.320 --> 05:03:45.599
Caption: levels along with the type of project

05:03:44.320 --> 05:03:47.359
Caption: methodology that&#39;s going to suit the

05:03:45.599 --> 05:03:48.560
Caption: organization that you&#39;re delivering to

05:03:47.359 --> 05:03:50.320
Caption: where your customers are comfortable

05:03:48.560 --> 05:03:53.281
Caption: with what your team&#39;s personalities are

05:03:50.320 --> 05:03:53.281
Caption: and so on and so forth

05:03:53.519 --> 05:03:58.796
Caption: often you&#39;ll find people gravitating

05:03:55.279 --> 05:04:01.519
Caption: towards process and

05:03:58.798 --> 05:04:03.041
Caption: um procedures in more like governance

05:04:01.519 --> 05:04:04.876
Caption: heavy and regulation and heavy

05:04:03.039 --> 05:04:08.078
Caption: environments or when people are

05:04:04.878 --> 05:04:10.400
Caption: particularly uncomfortable with chaos

05:04:08.080 --> 05:04:12.480
Caption: as consultants we&#39;re often asked to

05:04:10.400 --> 05:04:14.718
Caption: bring a best practice approach to

05:04:12.480 --> 05:04:17.441
Caption: executing work and it&#39;s fantastic for us

05:04:14.718 --> 05:04:19.121
Caption: to be able to lean on our experiences

05:04:17.439 --> 05:04:20.957
Caption: on what&#39;s worked really well before

05:04:19.119 --> 05:04:23.279
Caption: other similar companies or the similar

05:04:20.957 --> 05:04:24.957
Caption: size projects

05:04:23.279 --> 05:04:27.919
Caption: but the thing about software development

05:04:24.957 --> 05:04:28.796
Caption: is the sheer number of variables means

05:04:27.919 --> 05:04:30.957
Caption: that

05:04:28.798 --> 05:04:32.958
Caption: well there&#39;s no real silver bullet to

05:04:30.957 --> 05:04:34.158
Caption: delivering an outcome

05:04:32.957 --> 05:04:35.839
Caption: there&#39;s so many things that you need to

05:04:34.160 --> 05:04:37.121
Caption: consider when deciding on what&#39;s the

05:04:35.839 --> 05:04:38.400
Caption: best approach and technique that you can

05:04:37.119 --> 05:04:40.080
Caption: take

05:04:38.400 --> 05:04:43.281
Caption: what are the project funding cycles and

05:04:40.080 --> 05:04:44.638
Caption: how does your team report to them

05:04:43.279 --> 05:04:47.839
Caption: what kind of

05:04:44.638 --> 05:04:50.080
Caption: legal and regulatory bodies

05:04:47.839 --> 05:04:51.839
Caption: do you sit under there&#39;s so much that

05:04:50.080 --> 05:04:54.240
Caption: you have to consider here

05:04:51.839 --> 05:04:55.759
Caption: there&#39;s another talk about best fit and

05:04:54.240 --> 05:04:58.160
Caption: best practice that i think happened

05:04:55.759 --> 05:04:59.279
Caption: earlier today and i would love to catch

05:04:58.160 --> 05:05:00.480
Caption: that online and i highly highly

05:04:59.279 --> 05:05:02.478
Caption: recommend that you do too if you weren&#39;t

05:05:00.480 --> 05:05:03.839
Caption: able to get to it because there are so

05:05:02.480 --> 05:05:06.400
Caption: many different ways

05:05:03.839 --> 05:05:07.759
Caption: to organize yourselves and execute work

05:05:06.400 --> 05:05:10.560
Caption: and someone might organize themselves in

05:05:07.759 --> 05:05:10.560
Caption: a different way to you

05:05:11.199 --> 05:05:14.080
Caption: i am talking about both the

05:05:12.560 --> 05:05:16.958
Caption: opportunities when you&#39;re trying to

05:05:14.080 --> 05:05:17.839
Caption: introduce a new step in a process or

05:05:16.957 --> 05:05:19.359
Caption: when you&#39;re actually trying to take

05:05:17.839 --> 05:05:21.039
Caption: something out

05:05:19.359 --> 05:05:22.636
Caption: i can&#39;t count the number of times that

05:05:21.039 --> 05:05:25.119
Caption: someone&#39;s come to me with an idea to

05:05:22.638 --> 05:05:27.121
Caption: potentially or to my team let&#39;s organize

05:05:25.119 --> 05:05:28.716
Caption: the backlog a little bit differently

05:05:27.119 --> 05:05:30.716
Caption: or let&#39;s add a little bit more structure

05:05:28.718 --> 05:05:33.041
Caption: to sprint planning and it&#39;s always been

05:05:30.718 --> 05:05:34.240
Caption: met with resistance to change

05:05:33.039 --> 05:05:35.679
Caption: and that&#39;s the key thing about this

05:05:34.240 --> 05:05:37.759
Caption: particular topic

05:05:35.679 --> 05:05:39.839
Caption: as humans we are naturally resistant to

05:05:37.759 --> 05:05:41.759
Caption: change there&#39;s a lot of fear there&#39;s a

05:05:39.839 --> 05:05:43.839
Caption: lot of not being able to learn something

05:05:41.759 --> 05:05:45.919
Caption: from scratch or not performing well

05:05:43.839 --> 05:05:48.160
Caption: enough while you are learning

05:05:45.919 --> 05:05:49.839
Caption: but in this particular instance as well

05:05:48.160 --> 05:05:51.199
Caption: there could be some level of insecurity

05:05:49.839 --> 05:05:53.679
Caption: about you know why isn&#39;t the way that

05:05:51.199 --> 05:05:55.279
Caption: we&#39;ve been working good enough

05:05:53.679 --> 05:05:58.796
Caption: what&#39;s wrong with it we&#39;ve gotten here

05:05:55.279 --> 05:05:58.796
Caption: so i&#39;m all this way so far

05:05:59.359 --> 05:06:03.679
Caption: change only happens

05:06:01.199 --> 05:06:06.558
Caption: when the pain of staying the same is

05:06:03.679 --> 05:06:08.160
Caption: greater than the pain of change

05:06:06.560 --> 05:06:10.480
Caption: and the best thing to do in this

05:06:08.160 --> 05:06:14.240
Caption: scenario is to do something with and

05:06:10.480 --> 05:06:15.759
Caption: through someone rather than to them

05:06:14.240 --> 05:06:18.718
Caption: bring your folks together and actually

05:06:15.759 --> 05:06:20.400
Caption: have that frank discussion about

05:06:18.718 --> 05:06:21.521
Caption: what are the gaps that you&#39;re seeing

05:06:20.400 --> 05:06:23.361
Caption: what are the blockers and the

05:06:21.519 --> 05:06:25.359
Caption: bottlenecks that you want to address

05:06:23.359 --> 05:06:27.279
Caption: chances are others are potentially

05:06:25.359 --> 05:06:29.279
Caption: feeling it too but maybe they&#39;re too

05:06:27.279 --> 05:06:31.439
Caption: nervous to speak up or maybe they&#39;re too

05:06:29.279 --> 05:06:34.716
Caption: focused on the doing to be able to pause

05:06:31.439 --> 05:06:34.716
Caption: and reflect on how they&#39;re doing

05:06:35.919 --> 05:06:39.839
Caption: when you have people collaborating

05:06:37.679 --> 05:06:41.039
Caption: together on the solution it actually

05:06:39.839 --> 05:06:42.957

05:06:41.039 --> 05:06:44.636

05:06:42.957 --> 05:06:47.439
Caption: the changes that you&#39;re trying to get

05:06:44.638 --> 05:06:47.441
Caption: them to adapt to

05:06:47.759 --> 05:06:52.240
Caption: ask the question though is this actually

05:06:49.759 --> 05:06:53.519
Caption: going to help or hinder us this extra

05:06:52.240 --> 05:06:55.121
Caption: step that we&#39;re going to put in before

05:06:53.519 --> 05:06:56.558
Caption: we make a decision is that going to lead

05:06:55.119 --> 05:06:58.080
Caption: to better decisions

05:06:56.560 --> 05:06:59.521
Caption: are there other ways that we can get the

05:06:58.080 --> 05:07:01.679
Caption: same outcome

05:06:59.519 --> 05:07:04.240
Caption: even if it&#39;s not from a playbook or a

05:07:01.679 --> 05:07:04.240
Caption: scrum guide

05:07:05.519 --> 05:07:10.080
Caption: the main thing to remember though is to

05:07:07.439 --> 05:07:10.080
Caption: experiment

05:07:10.320 --> 05:07:15.759
Caption: give people a refund policy give them a

05:07:12.718 --> 05:07:17.441
Caption: bit of a way out basically

05:07:15.759 --> 05:07:19.599
Caption: um

05:07:17.439 --> 05:07:21.359
Caption: test the waters give something a red hot

05:07:19.599 --> 05:07:24.240
Caption: go before coming together as a team to

05:07:21.359 --> 05:07:25.759
Caption: evaluate is this actually working for us

05:07:24.240 --> 05:07:27.679
Caption: maybe it&#39;s uncovered something else that

05:07:25.759 --> 05:07:29.839
Caption: we&#39;d rather focus on

05:07:27.679 --> 05:07:31.599
Caption: building a culture of experimentation

05:07:29.839 --> 05:07:34.320
Caption: into your team early on

05:07:31.599 --> 05:07:36.957
Caption: makes it so much easier for you to add

05:07:34.320 --> 05:07:38.638
Caption: incremental change into your into the

05:07:36.957 --> 05:07:39.599
Caption: way that your team works more often

05:07:38.638 --> 05:07:41.521
Caption: because people are going to be

05:07:39.599 --> 05:07:42.876
Caption: comfortable and familiar that change is

05:07:41.519 --> 05:07:44.240
Caption: only going to stick when it&#39;s actually

05:07:42.878 --> 05:07:47.921
Caption: working for you

05:07:44.240 --> 05:07:49.679
Caption: but experimentation also also allows you

05:07:47.919 --> 05:07:52.160
Caption: and your team to scale as your product

05:07:49.679 --> 05:07:52.160
Caption: matures

05:07:56.798 --> 05:07:59.681
Caption: we didn&#39;t get anything done we didn&#39;t

05:07:58.080 --> 05:08:01.439
Caption: finish our sprints because you know they

05:07:59.679 --> 05:08:03.919
Caption: just kept changing their minds we can&#39;t

05:08:01.439 --> 05:08:05.919
Caption: seem to get anything right here

05:08:03.919 --> 05:08:07.519
Caption: yeah

05:08:05.919 --> 05:08:09.279
Caption: if you&#39;re hearing this let&#39;s talk about

05:08:07.519 --> 05:08:11.359
Caption: it

05:08:09.279 --> 05:08:12.957
Caption: scope creep changing requirements

05:08:11.359 --> 05:08:15.679
Caption: acrobatic backflipping clients it&#39;s a

05:08:12.957 --> 05:08:17.279
Caption: circus out there

05:08:15.679 --> 05:08:18.636
Caption: the agile manifesto was essentially

05:08:17.279 --> 05:08:20.636
Caption: borne out of many of the challenges that

05:08:18.638 --> 05:08:22.638
Caption: we&#39;ve discussed today

05:08:20.638 --> 05:08:24.638
Caption: but this is my favorite way of

05:08:22.638 --> 05:08:27.121
Caption: explaining why socializing your product

05:08:24.638 --> 05:08:29.201
Caption: early and often is the best way to avoid

05:08:27.119 --> 05:08:30.716
Caption: surprises

05:08:29.199 --> 05:08:32.238
Caption: you&#39;ve probably experienced this where

05:08:30.718 --> 05:08:34.080
Caption: your ba or your product owner or your

05:08:32.240 --> 05:08:36.240
Caption: customer themselves have spoken to you

05:08:34.080 --> 05:08:37.839
Caption: about this is what we want build it

05:08:36.240 --> 05:08:39.451
Caption: we&#39;ve gone and done the thing showed it

05:08:37.839 --> 05:08:41.439
Caption: to them

05:08:39.449 --> 05:08:43.119
Caption: [Music]

05:08:41.439 --> 05:08:44.400
Caption: the thing about changing requirements is

05:08:43.119 --> 05:08:46.238
Caption: though or changing your mind like

05:08:44.400 --> 05:08:48.080
Caption: everything in moderation like i said

05:08:46.240 --> 05:08:49.919
Caption: before we don&#39;t have a crystal ball and

05:08:48.080 --> 05:08:53.199
Caption: we don&#39;t expect everyone&#39;s going to get

05:08:49.919 --> 05:08:53.199
Caption: everything right the first time

05:08:54.320 --> 05:08:59.599
Caption: this is why feedback loops are so

05:08:57.039 --> 05:09:02.318
Caption: important early and often to make sure

05:08:59.599 --> 05:09:04.080
Caption: that you&#39;ll be able to catch this

05:09:02.320 --> 05:09:05.919
Caption: sooner rather than later and be able to

05:09:04.080 --> 05:09:09.119
Caption: have that conversation and go on the

05:09:05.919 --> 05:09:09.119
Caption: journey with your client

05:09:09.759 --> 05:09:13.439
Caption: we want to create sustainable solutions

05:09:11.919 --> 05:09:15.119
Caption: and happy customers

05:09:13.439 --> 05:09:17.439
Caption: and regular feedback is the best way to

05:09:15.119 --> 05:09:17.439
Caption: do that

05:09:18.320 --> 05:09:22.638
Caption: there&#39;s no sound but that&#39;s the caption

05:09:23.199 --> 05:09:27.839
Caption: at the end of the day

05:09:25.599 --> 05:09:29.759
Caption: you can spend all the time in the world

05:09:27.839 --> 05:09:31.599
Caption: understanding your customer spending

05:09:29.759 --> 05:09:34.320
Caption: time with them showcasing your product

05:09:31.599 --> 05:09:35.919
Caption: regularly and early

05:09:34.320 --> 05:09:37.759
Caption: you can understand their preferences and

05:09:35.919 --> 05:09:39.359
Caption: their style and still they might keep

05:09:37.759 --> 05:09:40.957
Caption: changing their minds

05:09:39.359 --> 05:09:43.119
Caption: there could be a few underlying reasons

05:09:40.957 --> 05:09:44.318
Caption: for this that they might not be upfront

05:09:43.119 --> 05:09:45.759
Caption: about with you

05:09:44.320 --> 05:09:47.201
Caption: maybe there&#39;s some funding issues that

05:09:45.759 --> 05:09:48.320
Caption: they&#39;re not at liberty to discuss with

05:09:47.199 --> 05:09:49.439
Caption: you

05:09:48.320 --> 05:09:51.041
Caption: or maybe they&#39;re just not the right

05:09:49.439 --> 05:09:53.359
Caption: people to actually make a decision at

05:09:51.039 --> 05:09:54.716
Caption: the end of it

05:09:53.359 --> 05:09:56.716
Caption: there&#39;s still a few things if you feel

05:09:54.718 --> 05:09:59.839
Caption: like you have the ability to influence

05:09:56.718 --> 05:09:59.839
Caption: but you can still do here

05:10:00.480 --> 05:10:04.480
Caption: help them build empathy for what it

05:10:02.957 --> 05:10:07.679
Caption: costs you

05:10:04.480 --> 05:10:10.080
Caption: to deal with their change of mind

05:10:07.679 --> 05:10:12.160
Caption: set your boundaries firmly but gently

05:10:10.080 --> 05:10:13.679
Caption: but explain why

05:10:12.160 --> 05:10:15.359
Caption: bring them on the journey with you and

05:10:13.679 --> 05:10:18.796
Caption: don&#39;t assume

05:10:15.359 --> 05:10:18.796
Caption: that they know what it costs you

05:10:18.878 --> 05:10:23.041
Caption: there&#39;s a one of my favorite things to

05:10:20.957 --> 05:10:24.796
Caption: do is the power of contrast

05:10:23.039 --> 05:10:26.398
Caption: i love presenting one good option that i

05:10:24.798 --> 05:10:28.560
Caption: want them to choose and then another

05:10:26.400 --> 05:10:30.958
Caption: option that&#39;s technically feasible but

05:10:28.560 --> 05:10:33.121
Caption: otherwise potentially not quite suitable

05:10:30.957 --> 05:10:34.716
Caption: it&#39;s much easier to be able to see

05:10:33.119 --> 05:10:37.119
Caption: and poke holes in something when you can

05:10:34.718 --> 05:10:39.281
Caption: actually see it

05:10:37.119 --> 05:10:41.679
Caption: presenting multiple options is also a

05:10:39.279 --> 05:10:44.240
Caption: fantastic way to

05:10:41.679 --> 05:10:46.080
Caption: demonstrate the evolution of a product

05:10:44.240 --> 05:10:48.320
Caption: vision and the ideas that all of you

05:10:46.080 --> 05:10:49.439
Caption: have had whether it be from a user&#39;s

05:10:48.320 --> 05:10:51.121
Caption: point of view

05:10:49.439 --> 05:10:52.876
Caption: or from a technical feasibility point of

05:10:51.119 --> 05:10:54.796
Caption: view

05:10:52.878 --> 05:10:56.320
Caption: i&#39;ve definitely been in scenarios when

05:10:54.798 --> 05:10:57.601
Caption: we&#39;ve been on a bit of a journey on what

05:10:56.320 --> 05:10:59.201
Caption: that product should be doing and we&#39;ve

05:10:57.599 --> 05:11:01.039
Caption: got customers who

05:10:59.199 --> 05:11:02.558
Caption: tend to sort of revert to thinking that

05:11:01.039 --> 05:11:04.158
Caption: they had maybe three months ago six

05:11:02.560 --> 05:11:06.080
Caption: months ago why can&#39;t we do it that way

05:11:04.160 --> 05:11:07.439
Caption: again i can&#39;t remember everyone&#39;s got a

05:11:06.080 --> 05:11:09.119
Caption: lot going on there&#39;s probably lots of

05:11:07.439 --> 05:11:10.320
Caption: projects that they&#39;re all spread across

05:11:09.119 --> 05:11:11.679
Caption: out on

05:11:10.320 --> 05:11:13.679
Caption: but presenting multiple options and

05:11:11.679 --> 05:11:14.957
Caption: being able to see that contrast can

05:11:13.679 --> 05:11:16.560
Caption: vividly

05:11:14.957 --> 05:11:18.238
Caption: show and demonstrate the difference

05:11:16.560 --> 05:11:20.878
Caption: between where we are now where we

05:11:18.240 --> 05:11:22.320
Caption: started from and clearly explaining why

05:11:20.878 --> 05:11:24.160
Caption: what is the evolution of our thought

05:11:22.320 --> 05:11:25.759
Caption: process here

05:11:24.160 --> 05:11:27.199
Caption: don&#39;t forget to reinforce any further

05:11:25.759 --> 05:11:28.320
Caption: benefits of

05:11:27.199 --> 05:11:30.478
Caption: the

05:11:28.320 --> 05:11:33.201
Caption: current state of what you&#39;ve built

05:11:30.480 --> 05:11:35.839
Caption: and let them know about ongoing support

05:11:33.199 --> 05:11:37.279
Caption: and feedback opportunities as well

05:11:35.839 --> 05:11:40.400
Caption: anything you can do to ease a little bit

05:11:37.279 --> 05:11:40.398
Caption: of that fear of commitment

05:11:42.240 --> 05:11:46.560
Caption: easier said than done for most

05:11:44.638 --> 05:11:48.160
Caption: but if you don&#39;t respect your own time

05:11:46.560 --> 05:11:51.201
Caption: and your own sanity

05:11:48.160 --> 05:11:51.199
Caption: other people won&#39;t either

05:11:52.957 --> 05:11:58.398
Caption: finally

05:11:55.279 --> 05:11:58.398
Caption: it&#39;s retro time

05:11:59.119 --> 05:12:04.000
Caption: you&#39;re talking about what you want to

05:12:00.718 --> 05:12:06.638
Caption: keep doing stop doing start doing

05:12:04.000 --> 05:12:08.080
Caption: and your team are all voting on how well

05:12:06.638 --> 05:12:09.441
Caption: the sprint went

05:12:08.080 --> 05:12:10.798
Caption: you&#39;re getting fours and fives out of

05:12:09.439 --> 05:12:12.320
Caption: five

05:12:10.798 --> 05:12:15.521
Caption: but maybe you didn&#39;t actually finish

05:12:12.320 --> 05:12:16.798
Caption: your stories maybe some blockers weren&#39;t

05:12:15.519 --> 05:12:18.480
Caption: escalated

05:12:16.798 --> 05:12:20.560
Caption: and dependencies on other teams were

05:12:18.480 --> 05:12:22.160
Caption: left really really late

05:12:20.560 --> 05:12:24.638
Caption: now i am specifically talking about

05:12:22.160 --> 05:12:26.638
Caption: those sprints where

05:12:24.638 --> 05:12:29.121
Caption: things weren&#39;t in tip-top shape but your

05:12:26.638 --> 05:12:32.718
Caption: team are quite close-knit

05:12:29.119 --> 05:12:34.318
Caption: and feeling a bit self-congratulatory or

05:12:32.718 --> 05:12:35.281
Caption: maybe they&#39;re ignoring the elephants in

05:12:34.320 --> 05:12:37.121
Caption: the room

05:12:35.279 --> 05:12:38.957
Caption: or maybe they&#39;re actually voting more on

05:12:37.119 --> 05:12:40.636
Caption: how each of you as individuals dealt

05:12:38.957 --> 05:12:43.439
Caption: with the challenges that your team faced

05:12:40.638 --> 05:12:45.601
Caption: rather than how the sprint actually went

05:12:43.439 --> 05:12:48.000
Caption: retrospectives are an opportunity

05:12:45.599 --> 05:12:50.000
Caption: to come together as a team and evaluate

05:12:48.000 --> 05:12:51.039
Caption: how people process and tools are coming

05:12:50.000 --> 05:12:53.119
Caption: together

05:12:51.039 --> 05:12:54.716
Caption: to help you and your team deliver it&#39;s

05:12:53.119 --> 05:12:56.796
Caption: not about airing dirty laundry and we&#39;re

05:12:54.718 --> 05:12:58.400
Caption: not asking for people to come out and

05:12:56.798 --> 05:13:00.000
Caption: point fingers and start fights or

05:12:58.400 --> 05:13:02.560
Caption: anything like that

05:13:00.000 --> 05:13:04.638
Caption: it is about balance and

05:13:02.560 --> 05:13:06.878
Caption: if you have a team that seems to be

05:13:04.638 --> 05:13:09.201
Caption: unwilling to speak about the real issues

05:13:06.878 --> 05:13:10.240
Caption: that are impacting delivery it could be

05:13:09.199 --> 05:13:12.716
Caption: a sign that they&#39;re lacking

05:13:10.240 --> 05:13:14.240
Caption: psychological safety

05:13:12.718 --> 05:13:16.718
Caption: you don&#39;t need harvard business review

05:13:14.240 --> 05:13:19.279
Caption: to tell you that psychological safety is

05:13:16.718 --> 05:13:21.521

05:13:19.279 --> 05:13:24.478

05:13:21.519 --> 05:13:26.000
Caption: sure each of us working day in day out

05:13:24.480 --> 05:13:28.638
Caption: but it also

05:13:26.000 --> 05:13:31.279
Caption: means that cognitive diversity diversity

05:13:28.638 --> 05:13:33.441

05:13:31.279 --> 05:13:35.039

05:13:33.439 --> 05:13:38.039
