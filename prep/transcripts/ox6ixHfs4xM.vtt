00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:39.680
Caption: procrastinating and get things done

00:00:38.398 --> 00:00:41.759

Caption: all right thank you ricky

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.639
Caption: hi everyone as you heard i am a lifelong

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:35.118
Caption: procrastinator and about a year ago i

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:37.759
Caption: decided to get serious about trying to

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.680
Caption: be more effective because i&#39;m not just

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.799
Caption: an accomplished procrastinator i&#39;m also

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.239
Caption: very easily distracted and honestly

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.920
Caption: being an easily distracted

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:48.158
Caption: procrastinator

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:49.599
Caption: is very frustrating i end up cross with

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:52.959
Caption: myself a lot

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:52.959
Caption: and being a little bit like

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.239
Caption: why are you like this i say this to

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.119
Caption: myself all the time

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:03.199
Caption: i called my talk escaping the vortex

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.960
Caption: because vortex is a shorthand that one

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:06.959
Caption: of my friends and i have always used to

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.958
Caption: explain this behavior where you get

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.800
Caption: sucked into something and you can&#39;t seem

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.399
Caption: to stop yourself from doing it and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.919
Caption: that&#39;s even if you&#39;ve got something else

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.119
Caption: that you should be doing or even if

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.839
Caption: there&#39;s something else that you would

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.720
Caption: rather be doing

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.479
Caption: so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.479
Caption: i&#39;m assuming since you&#39;re all here you

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:25.360
Caption: know how it feels to get sucked into the

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.360
Caption: vortex right

00:02:26.238 --> 00:02:31.919
Caption: so why do we get sucked into the vortex

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:34.479
Caption: there&#39;s a couple of reasons

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:37.360
Caption: i think it&#39;s because the way our brains

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:40.000
Caption: are wired makes us susceptible to both

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.518
Caption: both procrastination and distraction

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.319
Caption: and also because the things that are

00:02:41.518 --> 00:02:47.039
Caption: meant to engage us specifically leverage

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.440
Caption: that in order to hook us in

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:50.479
Caption: i&#39;m going to look at the reasons why we

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.479
Caption: procrastinate

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.839
Caption: and how understanding that can help us

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.199
Caption: overcome it

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:57.839
Caption: i&#39;m going to give a couple of examples

00:02:55.199 --> 00:03:00.080
Caption: of when i&#39;ve procrastinated dissect the

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:03.839
Caption: reasons behind it and then show the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.000
Caption: strategies that i use to get back on

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:07.759
Caption: with distraction we&#39;re going to discuss

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.679
Caption: a little bit of behavioral science but

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:12.479
Caption: not too much because it&#39;s complicated

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:13.759
Caption: and it&#39;s kind of a vortex in itself

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:16.238
Caption: and then we&#39;re going to look at the

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:18.720
Caption: practical steps that i took in order to

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:20.720
Caption: overcome distraction these steps are

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.440
Caption: aimed at both the external and the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.878
Caption: internal triggers of distraction

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.958
Caption: and those triggers are things that

00:03:24.878 --> 00:03:28.720
Caption: prompt us towards being distracted

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958
Caption: strategies that i use to get back on

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.919
Caption: track show some stats that show how i

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:36.158
Caption: improved my performance at work if

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:38.000
Caption: you&#39;re wondering where this mostly comes

00:03:36.158 --> 00:03:39.679
Caption: into it it&#39;s because i&#39;m still finding

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.759
Caption: it pretty challenging to overcome

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:43.279
Caption: distraction and procrastination in my

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:45.439
Caption: personal life

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.559
Caption: i&#39;m managing it a bit it&#39;s a bit better

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.440
Caption: than it was

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:51.518
Caption: it&#39;s a work in progress

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.680
Caption: so to get started let&#39;s look at

00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:55.518
Caption: procrastination

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:57.039
Caption: i think most people are pretty familiar

00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:58.958
Caption: with procrastination

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:01.360
Caption: is something you&#39;re supposed to be doing

00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:03.279
Caption: often something pretty important

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.798
Caption: but for some reason you just can&#39;t seem

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.798
Caption: to get started on doing it

00:04:08.238 --> 00:04:11.839
Caption: instead you&#39;re doing something that you

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:14.399
Caption: know for a fact isn&#39;t helpful

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:16.079
Caption: like watching tv or scrolling on social

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:17.518
Caption: media

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.359
Caption: or you&#39;re doing something that your

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.079
Caption: procrastination is sneakily trying to

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.800
Caption: pretend is helpful like

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.119
Caption: just clearing my desk so i can focus

00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:27.119
Caption: better

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.600
Caption: so i think when we think about

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:33.519
Caption: procrastination the

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.679
Caption: instinct is to kind of write it off as

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:37.679
Caption: laziness or lack of motivation

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.279
Caption: sorry excuse me

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.519
Caption: um so the fix is easy if you are a

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:48.799
Caption: better person with better self-control

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:51.519
Caption: you wouldn&#39;t procrastinate so much

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:53.359
Caption: right now this is obviously ridiculous

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:56.799
Caption: and yet it is the most common way that

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:59.279
Caption: people try and overcome procrastination

00:04:56.799 --> 00:05:01.119
Caption: you do some you procrastinate you feel

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.239
Caption: guilty about it you beat yourself up

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:03.279
Caption: about it

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:04.880
Caption: and then

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:07.119
Caption: you promise yourself you&#39;re going to do

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.639
Caption: better maybe you even do manage to do

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:09.440
Caption: better for a while

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.039
Caption: but

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.279
Caption: eventually you&#39;re going to end up back

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.959
Caption: at procrastination again

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:17.759
Caption: so why is this

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:20.079
Caption: i think it&#39;s because

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.679
Caption: better self-control doesn&#39;t address the

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:24.679
Caption: underlying reasons behind

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:24.679
Caption: procrastination

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.079
Caption: so

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.160
Caption: it doesn&#39;t get to the root causes now

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:32.239
Caption: i&#39;m going to show here a list of reasons

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.839
Caption: for procrastination and it&#39;s pretty

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:37.279
Caption: comprehensive although i think you can

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:37.279
Caption: probably think of some others

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.440
Caption: but

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:43.600
Caption: sorry i&#39;m a little bit

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.959
Caption: overwhelmed feeling over

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.399
Caption: um

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:48.638
Caption: i think

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:50.320
Caption: if we look at this it seems a little bit

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:54.399
Caption: overwhelming in and of itself right this

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.399
Caption: is a very small font to be working with

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:59.360
Caption: but i think if we look into it a little

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.080
Caption: more closely we can see that these

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:03.439
Caption: root causes these reasons can be broken

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:04.879
Caption: down into

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.239
Caption: just five

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.959
Caption: root causes maybe can maybe it can&#39;t

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:12.799
Caption: yes it can

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:15.839
Caption: okay now i&#39;m gonna leave out the

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:17.359
Caption: physical and or mental factors

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:19.519
Caption: they&#39;re obviously a massive problem for

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:21.758
Caption: a lot of people but it&#39;s really above my

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:24.959
Caption: pay grade to be discussing them the only

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:26.959
Caption: thing i can say is that if these things

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:28.479
Caption: are a big issue for you

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:30.160
Caption: then you should address them first

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.559
Caption: because otherwise any of the work you

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.839
Caption: try and do in any of these other areas

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:35.839
Caption: is going to be undermined

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.600
Caption: okay so

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:40.559
Caption: damn it i keep pressing the wrong button

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.639
Caption: right

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:44.639
Caption: so if we look at what&#39;s left i think we

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:47.360
Caption: can see that this can be boiled down

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:50.160
Caption: into just one thing

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:50.159
Caption: avoiding pain

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:55.119
Caption: it might be minor pain like my tax is

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.319
Caption: really boring or more significant pain

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:57.600
Caption: like

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:59.919
Caption: i&#39;m really stressed i&#39;m going to do a

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.279
Caption: bad job of my ddd talk and end up

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.479
Caption: looking like an idiot in front of a

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:04.160
Caption: bunch of people

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.319
Caption: news flash it&#39;s kind of happening guys

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.319
Caption: so

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.839
Caption: look

00:07:09.598 --> 00:07:14.399
Caption: wherever it is whatever the reasons

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:16.399
Caption: where it leaves us is avoiding the pain

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:18.319
Caption: in the short term

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:20.559
Caption: but then that often leaves us with

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:21.759
Caption: greater pain in the longer term and

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:23.598
Caption: actually there&#39;s a lot of people who

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:26.000
Caption: work in this space that include that in

00:07:23.598 --> 00:07:27.679
Caption: their definition of procrastination it&#39;s

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.559
Caption: not just that we&#39;re putting off an

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:32.000
Caption: important task is also the knowledge

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:34.239
Caption: that we&#39;re going to be worse off for

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.679
Caption: having delayed it we know this is what&#39;s

00:07:34.239 --> 00:07:38.000
Caption: going to happen

00:07:35.679 --> 00:07:41.199
Caption: and yet i do it all the time

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.199
Caption: and that brings us back to

00:07:41.598 --> 00:07:46.959
Caption: why are you like this why am i like this

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:49.839
Caption: okay well i think if we look at a couple

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:49.839
Caption: of examples

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:54.319
Caption: let&#39;s start with tax like i was talking

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.598
Caption: about before it&#39;s really boring right

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:58.239
Caption: so

00:07:55.598 --> 00:08:00.399
Caption: the first reason is task aversion it&#39;s

00:07:58.239 --> 00:08:02.079
Caption: boring and it sucks and because i don&#39;t

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:04.000
Caption: want to do this boring task that sucks

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:05.119
Caption: throughout the year i leave it all to

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.279
Caption: the end

00:08:05.119 --> 00:08:08.959
Caption: where it takes longer and is therefore

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:11.359
Caption: more boring

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:13.598
Caption: and because it takes longer i need

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:15.679
Caption: elevated levels of perseverance but i

00:08:13.598 --> 00:08:17.919
Caption: don&#39;t have that because the task is

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:20.559
Caption: boring and it sucks

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:23.039
Caption: now that could explain everything right

00:08:20.559 --> 00:08:25.519
Caption: it&#39;s boring it sucks no wonder i want to

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:27.119
Caption: procrastinate but actually if we dig a

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:28.638
Caption: little further into it there are a

00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:30.639
Caption: couple of things around the future that

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:31.679
Caption: come into play

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:33.359
Caption: so

00:08:31.679 --> 00:08:35.760
Caption: it doesn&#39;t take me long to do my tax

00:08:33.359 --> 00:08:37.200
Caption: right it&#39;s maybe like an hour and a half

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.239
Caption: and the government is just going to give

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.398
Caption: me money

00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:43.119
Caption: they&#39;re just going to give it to me

00:08:40.398 --> 00:08:44.640
Caption: why wouldn&#39;t i just do it

00:08:43.119 --> 00:08:46.559
Caption: well

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.359
Caption: the thing is by the time my accountant

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:52.000
Caption: files and the government processes it&#39;s

00:08:49.359 --> 00:08:54.398
Caption: kind of a little bit far in the future

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.919
Caption: so there&#39;s a delayed outcome it&#39;s not

00:08:54.398 --> 00:08:57.919
Caption: like there&#39;s a guy standing next to me

00:08:55.919 --> 00:09:01.359
Caption: with a lot of cash going if you do this

00:08:57.919 --> 00:09:03.838
Caption: for an hour you can have this

00:09:01.359 --> 00:09:05.599
Caption: and it&#39;s not even that far in the future

00:09:03.838 --> 00:09:07.278
Caption: but the reason it becomes important is

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:08.559
Caption: because there&#39;s a disconnect with my

00:09:07.278 --> 00:09:10.320
Caption: future self

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:12.559
Caption: i&#39;m like

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.039
Caption: i&#39;m doing all this work so her in three

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:16.398
Caption: weeks time gets a cash present what am i

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:18.159
Caption: getting out of this

00:09:16.398 --> 00:09:21.359
Caption: now what i&#39;m getting out of it is

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:22.958
Caption: obviously the cash present because i&#39;m

00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:25.039
Caption: the same person

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:27.278
Caption: but in the moment it doesn&#39;t feel like

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:27.278
Caption: that

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:31.359
Caption: the last thing is that this is a bit of

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.600
Caption: an abstract goal i don&#39;t have anything

00:09:31.359 --> 00:09:35.039
Caption: specifically that i&#39;m saving for

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:36.559
Caption: there&#39;s nothing i&#39;ve really earmarked

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:37.838
Caption: this money for

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:39.518
Caption: so

00:09:37.838 --> 00:09:41.518
Caption: there&#39;s not really anything specific

00:09:39.518 --> 00:09:45.039
Caption: that would make me

00:09:41.518 --> 00:09:47.679
Caption: motivated to strive to do this

00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:48.958
Caption: now if we look at another task oh sorry

00:09:47.679 --> 00:09:50.799
Caption: gone a little bit far if we&#39;re going to

00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.398
Caption: look at another task which is a

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:53.679
Caption: development task that i had to do at

00:09:52.398 --> 00:09:55.278
Caption: work

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:57.518
Caption: so we had a bit of a collaborative

00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:59.679
Caption: strategy meeting about what i would be

00:09:57.518 --> 00:10:01.599
Caption: doing but it wasn&#39;t something i&#39;d done

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:02.640
Caption: before so i didn&#39;t really know what i

00:10:01.599 --> 00:10:04.479
Caption: was doing

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.880
Caption: so the first one as you&#39;ve got a preview

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:08.239
Caption: of is indecisiveness

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.838
Caption: there were a couple of different paths i

00:10:08.239 --> 00:10:11.760
Caption: could take because i hadn&#39;t done it

00:10:09.838 --> 00:10:13.200
Caption: before i didn&#39;t know which one would be

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.799
Caption: the best one

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.160
Caption: i was also feeling a little bit

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:19.200
Caption: overwhelmed

00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:21.759
Caption: because i hadn&#39;t done it before

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:25.679
Caption: i was a little bit out of my depth

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:28.160
Caption: then i had general anxiety specifically

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:30.159
Caption: around the deadline because

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:32.479
Caption: it was a hard deadline and i knew that i

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:34.958
Caption: had to meet it it was a hard deadline

00:10:32.479 --> 00:10:37.039
Caption: that was a little bit tight actually so

00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:39.518
Caption: the pressure was on

00:10:37.039 --> 00:10:40.958
Caption: then there&#39;s fear of evaluation and this

00:10:39.518 --> 00:10:43.119
Caption: one is because

00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:45.760
Caption: my leader is this like

00:10:43.119 --> 00:10:48.239
Caption: insane code whisperer genius person and

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.559
Caption: that&#39;s usually a really good thing but

00:10:48.239 --> 00:10:51.518
Caption: it always adds an extra level of fear

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:53.919
Caption: about

00:10:51.518 --> 00:10:55.838
Caption: how good my code is

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:57.359
Caption: then there&#39;s a bit of task aversion in

00:10:55.838 --> 00:10:59.359
Caption: this one as well

00:10:57.359 --> 00:11:01.679
Caption: and that&#39;s mainly because i could help

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:04.078
Caption: this by doing a little bit of research

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:05.278
Caption: but i really find going on to like stack

00:11:04.078 --> 00:11:06.479
Caption: overflow

00:11:05.278 --> 00:11:08.559
Caption: or

00:11:06.479 --> 00:11:10.479
Caption: browsing through random repos usually a

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:12.559
Caption: bit tedious

00:11:10.479 --> 00:11:14.479
Caption: so if we put all that together it&#39;s not

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:16.239
Caption: hard to see why i want to put this off

00:11:14.479 --> 00:11:18.799
Caption: right if i don&#39;t even think about this

00:11:16.239 --> 00:11:20.799
Caption: task i&#39;m going to be saving myself a lot

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:23.039
Caption: of discomfort

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:24.398
Caption: but that&#39;s only in the short term in the

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:26.639
Caption: long term

00:11:24.398 --> 00:11:28.799
Caption: i&#39;m going to be adding fear of failure

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.720
Caption: to my list because

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:32.559
Caption: if i waste time

00:11:30.719 --> 00:11:36.199
Caption: there&#39;s a real possibility that i&#39;m

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:36.200
Caption: gonna miss the deadline

00:11:49.359 --> 00:11:52.799
Caption: all right sorry

00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:54.320
Caption: um so you can see my reasons for

00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:56.559
Caption: procrastination with both of these

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.640
Caption: things were very different

00:11:56.559 --> 00:12:00.559
Caption: okay

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.838
Caption: now we&#39;ve discovered what my reasons for

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:04.398
Caption: doing this were

00:12:01.838 --> 00:12:08.559
Caption: let&#39;s see what we can do to help me from

00:12:04.398 --> 00:12:11.278
Caption: stop to stop me from procrastinating

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:12.799
Caption: this is again a comprehensive list with

00:12:11.278 --> 00:12:14.880
Caption: quite small font

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:17.200
Caption: of some of the common things that people

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.078
Caption: suggest that you might use to overcome

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.079
Caption: procrastination

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.720
Caption: now

00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:25.679
Caption: um

00:12:24.719 --> 00:12:27.359
Caption: i think

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:29.278
Caption: this is probably a lot to take in but

00:12:27.359 --> 00:12:31.518
Caption: the one i would suggest paying attention

00:12:29.278 --> 00:12:33.200
Caption: to the most is this figuring out the

00:12:31.518 --> 00:12:35.119
Caption: exact nature of your procrastination

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.398
Caption: problem which is what we just went

00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:38.159
Caption: through there

00:12:36.398 --> 00:12:39.200
Caption: i think this should always be the first

00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:41.599
Caption: step

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.320
Caption: because the reasons that we procrasti

00:12:41.599 --> 00:12:45.759
Caption: procrastinate as we just saw are always

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.239
Caption: very different and that means that you

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.239
Caption: need different tools to overcome it you

00:12:48.239 --> 00:12:53.239
Caption: can&#39;t apply the same stuff in every

00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:53.239
Caption: situation

00:12:53.278 --> 00:12:56.799
Caption: okay

00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:58.799
Caption: so

00:12:56.799 --> 00:13:00.559
Caption: we return to my tax problem these are

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:02.159
Caption: all the reasons that i was

00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:03.440
Caption: procrastinating

00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:04.958
Caption: and we&#39;ll look at how i&#39;m going to

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.638
Caption: overcome this one

00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.799
Caption: so task aversion

00:13:06.638 --> 00:13:10.638
Caption: i&#39;m going to address by making a low bar

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:12.398
Caption: commitment

00:13:10.638 --> 00:13:13.759
Caption: what i&#39;m going to do in this case is to

00:13:12.398 --> 00:13:15.119
Caption: say

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.639
Caption: work on this for five minutes and then

00:13:15.119 --> 00:13:18.159
Caption: you can do 10 minutes of whatever you

00:13:16.638 --> 00:13:20.000
Caption: want i&#39;m going to work on it for 5

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:21.919
Caption: minutes again then i can do 10 minutes

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.760
Caption: of whatever i want now this is going to

00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:25.200
Caption: work for me for a couple of reasons

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.880
Caption: because it&#39;s

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.398
Caption: extremely short-term

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.638
Caption: i&#39;m going to get a reward almost

00:13:28.398 --> 00:13:32.078
Caption: straight away

00:13:30.638 --> 00:13:34.159
Caption: it&#39;s going to stop me from feeling

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:34.958
Caption: guilty about prioritizing my short-term

00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:36.559
Caption: mood

00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.559
Caption: because actually

00:13:36.559 --> 00:13:40.799
Caption: now that i&#39;ve said i can have those 10

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:42.799
Caption: minutes of reward those 10 minutes are

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:44.799
Caption: no longer procrastination they&#39;re

00:13:42.799 --> 00:13:46.398
Caption: actually what i said i was going to do

00:13:44.799 --> 00:13:48.559
Caption: in my plan

00:13:46.398 --> 00:13:50.799
Caption: it&#39;s also going to get me started on the

00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:52.320
Caption: task so i can stop feeling guilty that

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:54.000
Caption: i&#39;m putting it off

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.078
Caption: i don&#39;t have to have that dread hanging

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.198
Caption: over me that oh god i really should do

00:13:56.078 --> 00:13:59.359
Caption: it

00:13:57.198 --> 00:14:01.440
Caption: this is also going to address my lack of

00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:03.440
Caption: perseverance because i only have to do

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.760
Caption: it for five minutes

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.078
Caption: it&#39;s not really needing that much

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.239
Caption: self-control to keep going with it

00:14:08.078 --> 00:14:13.599
Caption: the key thing with this is

00:14:10.239 --> 00:14:15.119
Caption: obviously once you get started on a task

00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:17.039
Caption: five minutes can slip away really

00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:19.198
Caption: quickly and actually find out it&#39;s not

00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:21.039
Caption: as bad as you thought it was so now that

00:14:19.198 --> 00:14:22.880
Caption: i&#39;ve got myself started i&#39;m probably

00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:24.239
Caption: going to be engrossed and when the five

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.679
Caption: minutes are up

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:27.359
Caption: i&#39;m maybe not going to want to actually

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:29.039
Caption: stop i&#39;m probably halfway through

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:30.638
Caption: something that i don&#39;t want to leave

00:14:29.039 --> 00:14:34.000
Caption: unfinished

00:14:30.638 --> 00:14:34.000
Caption: so i&#39;ve got myself moving

00:14:34.638 --> 00:14:37.919
Caption: so

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.078
Caption: my abstract goal i&#39;m going to address by

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:41.518
Caption: attaching meaning to the task now

00:14:40.078 --> 00:14:43.198
Caption: there&#39;s a couple of things that i can

00:14:41.518 --> 00:14:45.919
Caption: attach meaning to here

00:14:43.198 --> 00:14:47.599
Caption: firstly there&#39;s the reward which is

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:50.078
Caption: getting my return

00:14:47.599 --> 00:14:52.799
Caption: secondly there&#39;s the negative outcome

00:14:50.078 --> 00:14:55.838
Caption: of getting a fine from the ato which has

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:57.919
Caption: happened to me before

00:14:55.838 --> 00:14:59.838
Caption: okay and i actually get fairly

00:14:57.919 --> 00:15:01.919
Caption: frustrated with myself when i end up

00:14:59.838 --> 00:15:04.159
Caption: with a stupid fine over nothing that was

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:06.078
Caption: completely avoidable so what i&#39;m going

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:08.398
Caption: to do

00:15:06.078 --> 00:15:10.479
Caption: is visualize the outcomes of me doing

00:15:08.398 --> 00:15:12.479
Caption: this work or in that case not doing the

00:15:10.479 --> 00:15:14.880
Caption: work i can remind myself that i&#39;m going

00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:17.039
Caption: to be really frustrated if i get a fine

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.119
Caption: and then i can also visualize that i&#39;m

00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:20.880
Caption: going to get this little return it&#39;s

00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:23.679
Caption: going to be in my bank balance it&#39;s

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.239
Caption: going to be a great time

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:28.479
Caption: okay i&#39;m also going to reward myself and

00:15:26.239 --> 00:15:30.078
Caption: that&#39;s going to

00:15:28.479 --> 00:15:32.078
Caption: help me with the delayed outcomes

00:15:30.078 --> 00:15:34.078
Caption: problem it&#39;s not an immediate reward

00:15:32.078 --> 00:15:36.000
Caption: like my 10 minutes what it&#39;s going to be

00:15:34.078 --> 00:15:37.518
Caption: is something tangible

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.198
Caption: so i&#39;m going to get my return from the

00:15:37.518 --> 00:15:41.359
Caption: government

00:15:39.198 --> 00:15:42.799
Caption: and then what i&#39;m going to do with that

00:15:41.359 --> 00:15:44.638
Caption: is actually

00:15:42.799 --> 00:15:47.760
Caption: say i&#39;m going to buy x with it

00:15:44.638 --> 00:15:49.198
Caption: specifically something that i want right

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.440
Caption: and then i&#39;m going to say to myself

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:55.799
Caption: you&#39;re not allowed to buy x

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.799
Caption: unless you do your tax return

00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:02.559
Caption: so now this is my task

00:15:59.198 --> 00:16:04.398
Caption: at work that i was procrastinating on

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:06.958
Caption: there&#39;s my little things including the

00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:11.119
Caption: fear of failure that came in at the end

00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:12.958
Caption: and i&#39;m gonna address my indecisiveness

00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:14.880
Caption: by sitting down with someone for five

00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.320
Caption: minutes and having them act as my rubber

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.679
Caption: ducky i&#39;m gonna have a little

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.518
Caption: conversation

00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:21.440
Caption: i&#39;m gonna be able to outline my thoughts

00:16:19.518 --> 00:16:22.638
Caption: more clearly and i&#39;m gonna clarify how

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.398
Caption: i&#39;m going to work

00:16:22.638 --> 00:16:27.278
Caption: towards a solution

00:16:24.398 --> 00:16:29.599
Caption: now their input is also going to give me

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:32.159
Caption: other ideas or other avenues that i

00:16:29.599 --> 00:16:34.239
Caption: might want to explore

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:36.078
Caption: that&#39;s also going to help me with my

00:16:34.239 --> 00:16:38.000
Caption: feeling overwhelm my feeling of being

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:39.119
Caption: overwhelmed

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.838
Caption: because now

00:16:39.119 --> 00:16:42.958
Caption: i&#39;ve got a plan in place

00:16:41.838 --> 00:16:45.039
Caption: i&#39;m further going to help my

00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:47.679
Caption: indecisiveness and my feeling of being

00:16:45.039 --> 00:16:49.359
Caption: overwhelmed by creating and implementing

00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:52.078
Caption: a plan

00:16:49.359 --> 00:16:54.719
Caption: what i&#39;m going to do is break this

00:16:52.078 --> 00:16:56.719
Caption: large task down into small and

00:16:54.719 --> 00:16:59.119
Caption: manageable tasks

00:16:56.719 --> 00:16:59.119
Caption: and then

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:03.838
Caption: i&#39;m going to set an intermediate

00:17:01.198 --> 00:17:05.198
Caption: deadline for each of those tasks that&#39;s

00:17:03.838 --> 00:17:06.719
Caption: going to help me with my deadline

00:17:05.198 --> 00:17:08.719
Caption: anxiety

00:17:06.719 --> 00:17:10.880
Caption: because now i&#39;m going to be able to see

00:17:08.719 --> 00:17:12.640
Caption: if i&#39;m getting off track

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.760
Caption: and i&#39;m going to be able to manage my

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.438
Caption: time more effectively

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.160
Caption: this is also going to help me with my

00:17:17.438 --> 00:17:22.239
Caption: fear of failure because if i know that

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.799
Caption: i&#39;m on track all the time or if i know

00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:26.798
Caption: i&#39;m getting off track i can ask for

00:17:24.798 --> 00:17:28.239
Caption: other tasks to be reassigned i can ask

00:17:26.798 --> 00:17:30.239
Caption: for another developer to come in and

00:17:28.239 --> 00:17:32.079
Caption: give me support any of that kind of

00:17:30.239 --> 00:17:33.678
Caption: stuff so i&#39;m no longer worried that i&#39;m

00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:35.519
Caption: going to miss the deadline it&#39;s just not

00:17:33.678 --> 00:17:39.839
Caption: going to happen anymore

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.839
Caption: my fear of evaluation oh sorry

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.678
Caption: i&#39;m now in a good place to make a low

00:17:41.678 --> 00:17:45.119
Caption: bar commitment even though this task is

00:17:43.678 --> 00:17:47.839
Caption: much bigger than the

00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:50.079
Caption: the tax task i can still get myself

00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:52.000
Caption: going by saying i&#39;ll just do five

00:17:50.079 --> 00:17:54.959
Caption: minutes because i&#39;ve got all these

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.479
Caption: interim tasks that are much smaller

00:17:54.959 --> 00:17:58.719
Caption: they&#39;re not as overwhelming to think

00:17:56.479 --> 00:18:01.280
Caption: about as the full thing i don&#39;t have to

00:17:58.719 --> 00:18:02.959
Caption: keep putting it off because i know

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.919
Caption: that there are smaller tasks that i can

00:18:02.959 --> 00:18:05.918
Caption: do

00:18:03.918 --> 00:18:08.079
Caption: the other thing my tasks are going to do

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:09.678
Caption: is allow me to choose the order i do

00:18:08.079 --> 00:18:11.519
Caption: them carefully

00:18:09.678 --> 00:18:13.519
Caption: so for some people

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.839
Caption: this looks like getting the least

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.200
Caption: attractive thing out the way right

00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:19.279
Caption: someone i used to work with used to say

00:18:17.199 --> 00:18:21.199
Caption: if you have to eat a frog eat it first

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.359
Caption: thing

00:18:21.199 --> 00:18:26.239
Caption: there&#39;s another group of people who like

00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:27.760
Caption: to get themselves motivated

00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:29.599
Caption: feeling good about themselves and sign

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.440
Caption: themselves up by crossing off a few

00:18:29.599 --> 00:18:33.599
Caption: little tasks you&#39;ve got a couple of wins

00:18:31.439 --> 00:18:35.439
Caption: in the bag you&#39;ve had a couple little

00:18:33.599 --> 00:18:36.959
Caption: things that you&#39;ve ticked off and so

00:18:35.439 --> 00:18:38.159
Caption: you&#39;re feeling good and ready to go on

00:18:36.959 --> 00:18:39.839
Caption: to the other stuff

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.200
Caption: it doesn&#39;t really matter which type of

00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:43.599
Caption: person you are

00:18:41.199 --> 00:18:46.079
Caption: but if you understand which type then

00:18:43.599 --> 00:18:47.760
Caption: you can choose your task order carefully

00:18:46.079 --> 00:18:50.558
Caption: and that can also help you avoid

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.558
Caption: procrastination

00:18:51.038 --> 00:18:54.159
Caption: now

00:18:52.719 --> 00:18:55.839
Caption: i&#39;m going to talk about prioritizing

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.440
Caption: your tasks by importance which sounds

00:18:55.839 --> 00:18:58.640
Caption: like it kind of counterman&#39;s the one

00:18:57.439 --> 00:19:00.719
Caption: we&#39;ve just said

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:03.119
Caption: but they work together

00:19:00.719 --> 00:19:05.760
Caption: because one of the caveats of choosing

00:19:03.119 --> 00:19:08.558
Caption: your task order is that you can actually

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.440
Caption: use the subtasks to procrastinate on the

00:19:08.558 --> 00:19:13.119
Caption: main task because procrastination is

00:19:11.439 --> 00:19:14.079
Caption: very sneaky

00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:16.079
Caption: i&#39;ve

00:19:14.079 --> 00:19:18.000
Caption: had a file open it&#39;s the file i&#39;m

00:19:16.079 --> 00:19:21.119
Caption: supposed to be working on i&#39;m literally

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.119
Caption: working on it i&#39;m like writing code

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:25.599
Caption: and it&#39;s still procrastination because

00:19:23.119 --> 00:19:27.119
Caption: it isn&#39;t the task that i opened the file

00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:28.798
Caption: to do

00:19:27.119 --> 00:19:30.640
Caption: the reason i&#39;m choosing to do this

00:19:28.798 --> 00:19:32.798
Caption: little easy task

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:36.558
Caption: fixing up the way the header displays

00:19:32.798 --> 00:19:39.760
Caption: is because i&#39;m procrastinating on the

00:19:36.558 --> 00:19:42.239
Caption: more daunting part of the task

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.160
Caption: so i&#39;m going to avoid that by also

00:19:42.239 --> 00:19:46.400
Caption: prioritizing if i&#39;m the sort of person

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.000
Caption: that needs to psych myself up i&#39;m going

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.440
Caption: to give myself permission to do one or

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.599
Caption: two little things

00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:56.639
Caption: and then straight into the next one

00:19:53.599 --> 00:19:58.880
Caption: so my fear of evaluation i&#39;m going to

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.119
Caption: sort out by acknowledging that my work

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.678
Caption: is going to have some flaws

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:05.678
Caption: and the thing about my flaws is

00:20:03.678 --> 00:20:07.839
Caption: they&#39;re not a reflection on my worth as

00:20:05.678 --> 00:20:09.918
Caption: a person which is how it can feel

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:12.239
Caption: sometimes right

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:13.439
Caption: actually they&#39;re a learning opportunity

00:20:12.239 --> 00:20:15.760
Caption: it&#39;s something that i&#39;m gonna know

00:20:13.439 --> 00:20:18.000
Caption: better for next time

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.079
Caption: now everything i&#39;ve done so far actually

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Caption: helps me with my task aversion because

00:20:20.079 --> 00:20:23.439
Caption: i&#39;m a lot clearer on what it is that i&#39;m

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.199
Caption: doing

00:20:23.439 --> 00:20:28.319
Caption: i don&#39;t have to

00:20:25.199 --> 00:20:28.319
Caption: well probably won&#39;t have to

00:20:28.719 --> 00:20:31.760
Caption: consult it straight away i might not

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:33.038
Caption: have to at all

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.558
Caption: if i do

00:20:33.038 --> 00:20:36.719
Caption: i&#39;m going to be able to be more focused

00:20:34.558 --> 00:20:38.399
Caption: in what i&#39;m searching for i&#39;m not doing

00:20:36.719 --> 00:20:41.839
Caption: generalized research i&#39;m going to be

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:45.599
Caption: looking for specific problem solving

00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:45.599
Caption: so that is also going to be addressed

00:20:47.199 --> 00:20:52.399
Caption: all right so you can see that on the

00:20:49.199 --> 00:20:54.798
Caption: surface these things look similar right

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.159
Caption: it was two tasks i was putting them off

00:20:54.798 --> 00:20:58.158
Caption: i knew it was a bad idea

00:20:58.239 --> 00:21:03.520
Caption: probably i&#39;m just a bad person right

00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:05.280
Caption: actually

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.280
Caption: if we look at it closely

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.520
Caption: what we can see is not only is this not

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.359
Caption: a moral failing on my part but the

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.039
Caption: reasons are so different that my

00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:15.038
Caption: strategies need to be different to deal

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:18.879
Caption: with them as well and that&#39;s what i want

00:21:15.038 --> 00:21:20.558
Caption: you to remember about procrastination

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.719
Caption: now i&#39;m going to move on to the second

00:21:20.558 --> 00:21:24.640
Caption: part of the presentation and talk about

00:21:22.719 --> 00:21:25.678
Caption: distraction

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.880
Caption: now

00:21:25.678 --> 00:21:28.079
Caption: i&#39;m not going to be all down on

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.959
Caption: technology

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:32.798
Caption: i love technology but

00:21:30.959 --> 00:21:34.239
Caption: i think it&#39;s important for us to admit

00:21:32.798 --> 00:21:36.319
Caption: out loud that

00:21:34.239 --> 00:21:38.079
Caption: in this wonderful world we&#39;ve built of

00:21:36.319 --> 00:21:40.319
Caption: instantaneous connection and

00:21:38.079 --> 00:21:42.239
Caption: instantaneous content there are more

00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:45.479
Caption: things competing for our attention than

00:21:42.239 --> 00:21:45.479
Caption: ever before

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.880
Caption: and a lot of those things were designed

00:21:50.719 --> 00:21:55.199
Caption: to specifically hook us in they&#39;re

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:59.760
Caption: leveraging that brain pattern to keep us

00:21:55.199 --> 00:22:01.760
Caption: coming back again and again

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.440
Caption: right it&#39;s not really surprising under

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.079
Caption: these circumstances that we find

00:22:03.439 --> 00:22:07.759
Caption: ourselves getting sucked into the vortex

00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:10.000
Caption: maybe we&#39;re scrolling endlessly on

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.760
Caption: social media

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.760
Caption: maybe we&#39;re binging a whole tv series

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.000
Caption: maybe we&#39;re hooked on a notification

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.400
Caption: badge or we find ourselves unable to let

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.038
Caption: an email go unanswered even though we&#39;re

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.039
Caption: in the middle of a task

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:36.000
Caption: now this might seem innocuous

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.080
Caption: like does it really matter if you take

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.239
Caption: 30 seconds out of your day to answer an

00:22:38.079 --> 00:22:43.279
Caption: email and actually it kind of does and

00:22:40.239 --> 00:22:43.280
Caption: we&#39;re going to come back to that

00:22:43.359 --> 00:22:47.280
Caption: you might also think

00:22:45.119 --> 00:22:49.199
Caption: if i&#39;m just sitting at home on the couch

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.719
Caption: after work shouldn&#39;t i be able to scroll

00:22:49.199 --> 00:22:52.558
Caption: as much as i want

00:22:50.719 --> 00:22:54.719
Caption: and yeah maybe you should

00:22:52.558 --> 00:22:56.399
Caption: but where it becomes a problem is where

00:22:54.719 --> 00:22:58.640
Caption: distraction stops us from doing the

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.520
Caption: things that are really important to us

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.678
Caption: so

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.039
Caption: in your personal life that might look

00:23:01.678 --> 00:23:05.038
Caption: like you

00:23:03.038 --> 00:23:07.038
Caption: not being as present for your kids as

00:23:05.038 --> 00:23:08.479
Caption: you&#39;d like it might look like you&#39;re not

00:23:07.038 --> 00:23:09.839
Caption: fully pulling the weight in your

00:23:08.479 --> 00:23:12.400
Caption: relationship

00:23:09.839 --> 00:23:16.158
Caption: it might look like your house being in

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:18.159
Caption: an advanced state of chaos all the time

00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:20.000
Caption: whatever it is it&#39;s likely to be

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:21.520
Caption: something that you&#39;re aware of and it&#39;s

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.439
Caption: likely to be something that causes you

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.000
Caption: pain and you know how we like to deal

00:23:23.439 --> 00:23:26.719
Caption: with pain

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.239
Caption: procrastination

00:23:26.719 --> 00:23:30.319
Caption: and that&#39;s how you end up in that loop

00:23:28.239 --> 00:23:32.640
Caption: where at the end of the weekend you&#39;ve

00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:34.399
Caption: only got a tenth of your task done and

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.000
Caption: you know full well it&#39;s your own fault

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.960
Caption: because you spent most of the time

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.959
Caption: binging netflix

00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:44.320
Caption: so

00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:47.760
Caption: when this happens

00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:49.280
Caption: we&#39;re most likely going to end up back

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:53.039
Caption: at

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:55.280
Caption: why are you like this i do it a lot

00:23:53.038 --> 00:23:55.279
Caption: okay

00:23:56.479 --> 00:24:02.640
Caption: like procrastination the most easy

00:23:59.119 --> 00:24:05.760
Caption: solution easy solution to distraction

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:08.159
Caption: is better self-control again if you&#39;re a

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.880
Caption: better person you wouldn&#39;t spend as much

00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:12.880
Caption: time mindlessly scrolling

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.880
Caption: now i&#39;m going to go into a little bit of

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.798
Caption: this complicated behavioral science we

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.319
Caption: spoke about before

00:24:16.798 --> 00:24:20.000
Caption: because i want to explain to you

00:24:18.319 --> 00:24:22.479
Caption: something that&#39;s called ironic process

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.319
Caption: theory because this shows why

00:24:22.479 --> 00:24:26.158
Caption: better self-control

00:24:24.319 --> 00:24:27.839
Caption: mental abstinence

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:29.679
Caption: which is

00:24:27.839 --> 00:24:31.119
Caption: using your self-control to stop yourself

00:24:29.678 --> 00:24:32.719
Caption: from doing something that you actually

00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:35.839
Caption: really want to do

00:24:32.719 --> 00:24:38.158
Caption: isn&#39;t the answer to distraction

00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:40.079
Caption: so it starts with this quote which is

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:42.400
Caption: from dostoyevsky

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:44.319
Caption: try to post for yourself this task

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.839
Caption: not to think of a white bear

00:24:44.319 --> 00:24:49.439
Caption: and you will see that the cursed thing

00:24:45.839 --> 00:24:49.439
Caption: will come to mind every minute

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.558
Caption: here&#39;s an outlook guys

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.760
Caption: so fast forwarding 120 odd years a

00:24:55.839 --> 00:25:00.079
Caption: social psychologist called

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.839
Caption: daniel wegner decided to put this to the

00:25:00.079 --> 00:25:04.558
Caption: task he really liked this quote so he

00:25:01.839 --> 00:25:06.479
Caption: was like let&#39;s do an experiment

00:25:04.558 --> 00:25:08.719
Caption: so he had two groups

00:25:06.479 --> 00:25:11.038
Caption: one group was told specifically to think

00:25:08.719 --> 00:25:13.439
Caption: of a white bear for five minutes

00:25:11.038 --> 00:25:15.519
Caption: one group was told specifically to not

00:25:13.439 --> 00:25:17.759
Caption: think of a white bear now the group that

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.919
Caption: was told not to failed miserably they

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.520
Caption: did it on average once a minute and

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:22.880
Caption: that&#39;s kind of what we&#39;re expecting

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.039
Caption: because this quote

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.959
Caption: rings true for most people right

00:25:25.038 --> 00:25:28.959
Caption: the interesting part is

00:25:26.959 --> 00:25:30.880
Caption: the second half of the experiment was to

00:25:28.959 --> 00:25:31.760
Caption: tell both groups to think of the white

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.678
Caption: bear

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.599
Caption: and when they did that the group that

00:25:33.678 --> 00:25:37.599
Caption: had initially suppressed the thoughts of

00:25:35.599 --> 00:25:39.839
Caption: the white bear actually brought the

00:25:37.599 --> 00:25:41.678
Caption: white beard to mind more readily than

00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:43.760
Caption: the group who had been told to think of

00:25:41.678 --> 00:25:45.839
Caption: it all along

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.239
Caption: what wegner found is that if you try and

00:25:45.839 --> 00:25:50.319
Caption: suppress thoughts of something it

00:25:48.239 --> 00:25:51.439
Caption: actually makes you more susceptible to

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:53.839
Caption: that thing

00:25:51.439 --> 00:25:56.639
Caption: this is called behavioral rebound and it

00:25:53.839 --> 00:25:58.640
Caption: works in everything from like trying to

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.359
Caption: control addiction to trying to suppress

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.359
Caption: your laughter

00:26:04.159 --> 00:26:06.640
Caption: all right

00:26:05.359 --> 00:26:08.239
Caption: so

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.320
Caption: there are a couple of techniques that

00:26:08.239 --> 00:26:11.918
Caption: you can find for trying to deal with

00:26:10.319 --> 00:26:14.639
Caption: intrusive thoughts that are brought to

00:26:11.918 --> 00:26:16.319
Caption: mind that cause behavioral rebound but

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.719
Caption: they&#39;re mostly for things like if you&#39;re

00:26:16.319 --> 00:26:21.439
Caption: quitting smoking

00:26:18.719 --> 00:26:23.599
Caption: for distraction i&#39;ve found the easiest

00:26:21.439 --> 00:26:25.759
Caption: way to deal with it is just to remove

00:26:23.599 --> 00:26:26.959
Caption: the stimulus

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.558
Caption: right

00:26:26.959 --> 00:26:31.520
Caption: i know that i&#39;m

00:26:28.558 --> 00:26:33.760
Caption: susceptible to alerts and notifications

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.919
Caption: so what i&#39;m going to do is simply stop

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.760
Caption: that from being able to happen

00:26:35.918 --> 00:26:39.839
Caption: so i started with the biggest culprit

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.839
Caption: which was my phone

00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:44.239
Caption: i just reconfigured it

00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:47.760
Caption: so i uninstalled some apps goodbye

00:26:44.239 --> 00:26:49.918
Caption: reddit goodbye wordscapes

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.599
Caption: and it didn&#39;t take long for me to be

00:26:49.918 --> 00:26:53.119
Caption: broken from the habit of those two

00:26:51.599 --> 00:26:54.558
Caption: things right

00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:56.400
Caption: and actually an interesting thing

00:26:54.558 --> 00:26:58.640
Caption: happened which is that my nieces asked

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.159
Caption: me if they could reinstall wordscapes

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.200
Caption: and i let them

00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:03.600
Caption: because

00:27:01.199 --> 00:27:05.599
Caption: they like to play it it&#39;s like all right

00:27:03.599 --> 00:27:08.239
Caption: it&#39;s a problem for me but okay

00:27:05.599 --> 00:27:09.760
Caption: and actually as it turns out it wasn&#39;t a

00:27:08.239 --> 00:27:11.678
Caption: problem for me

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.239
Caption: i know it&#39;s there it&#39;s still there it&#39;s

00:27:11.678 --> 00:27:15.760
Caption: still installed i never open it

00:27:14.239 --> 00:27:16.880
Caption: they use it and they&#39;re the only ones

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.558
Caption: who do

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.558
Caption: and that&#39;s because i broke the habit

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.799
Caption: the second thing that i did with my

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.760
Caption: phone was to configure the notifications

00:27:32.798 --> 00:27:36.000
Caption: so

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.239
Caption: i&#39;ve always had lock screen notification

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.479
Caption: disabled that&#39;s just how i roll

00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:41.678
Caption: but i did always have like an audio

00:27:40.479 --> 00:27:43.599
Caption: alert that comes up you get a little

00:27:41.678 --> 00:27:45.359
Caption: ping you&#39;re like oh what&#39;s this you go

00:27:43.599 --> 00:27:47.199
Caption: and look at it right

00:27:45.359 --> 00:27:49.278
Caption: so what i did with that was i actually

00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:51.839
Caption: configured my do not disturb so that i

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:53.200
Caption: can have it switched on permanently

00:27:51.839 --> 00:27:54.398
Caption: so what i let

00:27:53.199 --> 00:27:56.880
Caption: come through

00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:58.720
Caption: is nothing but phone calls i decided i

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.558
Caption: want pretty much anyone to always be

00:27:58.719 --> 00:28:03.199
Caption: able to get me on the phone

00:28:00.558 --> 00:28:04.880
Caption: maybe not your telemarketers but

00:28:03.199 --> 00:28:06.558
Caption: if something important or crucial is

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.239
Caption: going to happen to my friends to my

00:28:06.558 --> 00:28:10.558
Caption: family they&#39;re going to pick up the

00:28:08.239 --> 00:28:12.640
Caption: phone and call me so anyone can always

00:28:10.558 --> 00:28:15.678
Caption: call me but apart from that everything

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.919
Caption: else is completely silent so now the

00:28:15.678 --> 00:28:18.959
Caption: only way that i know if i&#39;ve got a text

00:28:17.918 --> 00:28:22.239
Caption: message

00:28:18.959 --> 00:28:24.880
Caption: an email from a non-work account

00:28:22.239 --> 00:28:26.558
Caption: a notification from one of the like four

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.678
Caption: different instant messaging platforms i

00:28:26.558 --> 00:28:29.678
Caption: have

00:28:27.678 --> 00:28:33.439
Caption: is if i pick up my phone

00:28:29.678 --> 00:28:35.359
Caption: and unlock it and explicitly look for it

00:28:33.439 --> 00:28:37.278
Caption: this is a great time saver for me

00:28:35.359 --> 00:28:39.678
Caption: because i&#39;m just not picking up my phone

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:39.679
Caption: as much

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:45.520
Caption: excuse me

00:28:43.199 --> 00:28:47.439
Caption: now

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.440
Caption: the next thing i&#39;m going to talk about

00:28:47.439 --> 00:28:51.439
Caption: was

00:28:49.439 --> 00:28:53.278
Caption: is sorry the next thing i&#39;m going to

00:28:51.439 --> 00:28:55.199
Caption: talk about is actually

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:56.960
Caption: dealing with the internal triggers of

00:28:55.199 --> 00:28:58.719
Caption: distraction so you can see the stuff

00:28:56.959 --> 00:29:00.880
Caption: that i&#39;ve talked about already is

00:28:58.719 --> 00:29:02.959
Caption: external triggers there&#39;s a little noise

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.279
Caption: i&#39;m prompted to pick up my phone but

00:29:02.959 --> 00:29:06.880
Caption: there are also internal triggers and for

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:09.200
Caption: me they come up

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:12.000
Caption: in my moments of peak distractibility

00:29:09.199 --> 00:29:13.599
Caption: and they&#39;re all internal so it&#39;s like i

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.880
Caption: finish one task and i&#39;m gonna start

00:29:13.599 --> 00:29:17.038
Caption: another

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.760
Caption: and i&#39;m just gonna pick up my phone and

00:29:17.038 --> 00:29:22.319
Caption: you know send a text

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.320
Caption: i&#39;ve

00:29:23.678 --> 00:29:29.519
Caption: finished a job that i was to do and i

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.520
Caption: feel like i need to reward myself

00:29:29.678 --> 00:29:33.760
Caption: in those moments i&#39;m most susceptible to

00:29:32.239 --> 00:29:35.760
Caption: distractibility because i&#39;m not just

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.599
Caption: going to pick up this thing and look at

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.640
Caption: it for a few seconds i&#39;m going to keep

00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:40.479
Caption: doing it

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.479
Caption: one of the ones i do a lot of the time

00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:44.239
Caption: is like when something is loading or i&#39;m

00:29:42.479 --> 00:29:45.918
Caption: waiting for a two-factor authentication

00:29:44.239 --> 00:29:48.640
Caption: something like that this is literally

00:29:45.918 --> 00:29:50.239
Caption: like a 10-second period but i can&#39;t go

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.440
Caption: for those 10 seconds without being

00:29:50.239 --> 00:29:53.760
Caption: entertained

00:29:51.439 --> 00:29:56.158
Caption: i just can&#39;t

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:59.039
Caption: so all these triggers i need a different

00:29:56.159 --> 00:30:01.279
Caption: approach to be able to

00:29:59.038 --> 00:30:03.278
Caption: deal with now the first thing i did was

00:30:01.279 --> 00:30:06.480
Caption: still configuring my tech

00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:08.399
Caption: and that was to disable google discover

00:30:06.479 --> 00:30:10.079
Caption: do you all know what google discover is

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:11.919
Caption: are you familiar with this it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:30:10.079 --> 00:30:14.959
Caption: this thing

00:30:11.918 --> 00:30:16.558
Caption: this is a little screenshot of mine

00:30:14.959 --> 00:30:18.880
Caption: i haven&#39;t looked at the begonia yet i am

00:30:16.558 --> 00:30:21.599
Caption: still interested

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:23.440
Caption: so this was a massive vortex for me

00:30:21.599 --> 00:30:26.479
Caption: because actually google is really good

00:30:23.439 --> 00:30:27.599
Caption: at knowing what i&#39;m into begonias

00:30:26.479 --> 00:30:30.239
Caption: cat memes

00:30:27.599 --> 00:30:30.239
Caption: it&#39;s all good

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.520
Caption: and the problem was

00:30:33.038 --> 00:30:38.158
Caption: that once i had disabled reddit it was

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.760
Caption: also popping up like a lot of well

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:41.760
Caption: obviously cat memes but also a lot of

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:43.919
Caption: like agony aunt content that i had

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.440
Caption: previously been seeing on reddit and i

00:30:43.918 --> 00:30:47.839
Caption: ended up in a little bit of a spiral

00:30:45.439 --> 00:30:50.959
Caption: where i was actually reading like reddit

00:30:47.839 --> 00:30:54.239
Caption: aita posts but just screenshotted on a

00:30:50.959 --> 00:30:57.038
Caption: content aggregator website

00:30:54.239 --> 00:31:00.079
Caption: which is just plus all right google

00:30:57.038 --> 00:31:01.199
Caption: discover you&#39;ve got to go

00:31:00.079 --> 00:31:03.278
Caption: okay

00:31:01.199 --> 00:31:04.639
Caption: so i think i think at one point i had

00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:06.080
Caption: looked at

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.320
Caption: an article that one of my friends had

00:31:06.079 --> 00:31:10.000
Caption: posted and accidentally gave it the

00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:12.959
Caption: impression that i care about infant

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.199
Caption: health care in any way which i don&#39;t

00:31:12.959 --> 00:31:17.038
Caption: but apart from that it was nailing it

00:31:15.199 --> 00:31:19.119
Caption: with the cat memes the agony art stuff

00:31:17.038 --> 00:31:21.278
Caption: right so

00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:23.839
Caption: what i did was to just

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:25.200
Caption: disable it and it was a bit of a problem

00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:27.599
Caption: actually to try and do that because how

00:31:25.199 --> 00:31:30.079
Caption: it worked for me was just a single swipe

00:31:27.599 --> 00:31:31.918
Caption: from my home screen i had to google

00:31:30.079 --> 00:31:34.959
Caption: quite deeply to work out how to turn

00:31:31.918 --> 00:31:36.398
Caption: that functionality off but i managed it

00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:38.319
Caption: once i&#39;d done it

00:31:36.399 --> 00:31:40.239
Caption: it was really noticeable just how many

00:31:38.319 --> 00:31:41.599
Caption: times a day i reached for it because i

00:31:40.239 --> 00:31:43.199
Caption: would swipe

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:45.359
Caption: and i&#39;d do it a couple of times because

00:31:43.199 --> 00:31:49.359
Caption: it hadn&#39;t worked and then i&#39;d be like

00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:51.918
Caption: oh i&#39;m doing that thing again

00:31:49.359 --> 00:31:54.158
Caption: and the interesting thing about this is

00:31:51.918 --> 00:31:56.719
Caption: like before this content is actually

00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:59.279
Caption: available to me at any time if i open a

00:31:56.719 --> 00:32:00.880
Caption: new blank tab in chrome

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:03.519
Caption: it&#39;s just there that&#39;s the default

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:06.000
Caption: behavior but because i broke the little

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:07.600
Caption: reflex of swiping

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.519
Caption: it also

00:32:07.599 --> 00:32:12.319
Caption: delivered a pretty big hit to the mental

00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:12.320
Caption: part of it as well

00:32:12.959 --> 00:32:17.278
Caption: now unfortunately

00:32:15.439 --> 00:32:18.959
Caption: just disabling this one app is not

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:21.119
Caption: enough to deal completely with my

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:23.119
Caption: internal triggers of distraction

00:32:21.119 --> 00:32:24.880
Caption: i also needed a strategy to be able to

00:32:23.119 --> 00:32:26.558
Caption: do that

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.719
Caption: so the first thing is

00:32:26.558 --> 00:32:30.640
Caption: i&#39;m gonna have to notice the trigger

00:32:28.719 --> 00:32:32.558
Caption: and ideally has to be in the moment you

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.880
Caption: can kind of do it as a retrospective

00:32:32.558 --> 00:32:36.479
Caption: like all right i just put my phone down

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.918
Caption: after looking at it for 10 minutes when

00:32:36.479 --> 00:32:39.918
Caption: i was just

00:32:37.918 --> 00:32:40.959
Caption: waiting for two-factor authentication

00:32:39.918 --> 00:32:42.479
Caption: whoops

00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:43.839
Caption: but it&#39;s better if you notice it at the

00:32:42.479 --> 00:32:44.880
Caption: time you&#39;re doing it

00:32:43.839 --> 00:32:46.719
Caption: and for me

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.719
Caption: disabling google discover was a really

00:32:46.719 --> 00:32:50.640
Caption: good thing for this because like i said

00:32:48.719 --> 00:32:52.959
Caption: super noticeable when i tried to do it

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.880
Caption: and it didn&#39;t work

00:32:52.959 --> 00:32:56.640
Caption: now the second step

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.479
Caption: is that i&#39;m gonna explore the feelings

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.320
Caption: i&#39;m not gonna judge myself and be like

00:32:58.479 --> 00:33:02.158
Caption: oh you&#39;re a bad person

00:33:00.319 --> 00:33:03.678
Caption: what i&#39;m gonna do is just think about it

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:05.679
Caption: for a while

00:33:03.678 --> 00:33:07.918
Caption: get curious wonder why i&#39;m wanting to be

00:33:05.678 --> 00:33:09.678
Caption: distracted and as before with my

00:33:07.918 --> 00:33:12.798
Caption: procrastination when i&#39;m thinking about

00:33:09.678 --> 00:33:14.239
Caption: why i want to procrastinate

00:33:12.798 --> 00:33:16.239
Caption: it is

00:33:14.239 --> 00:33:19.119
Caption: easier for me to

00:33:16.239 --> 00:33:21.359
Caption: understand and sit in the moment if i&#39;ve

00:33:19.119 --> 00:33:23.839
Caption: interrogated a little bit it&#39;s kind of

00:33:21.359 --> 00:33:25.439
Caption: like wagner&#39;s second group of people

00:33:23.839 --> 00:33:26.798
Caption: maybe first group of people the people

00:33:25.439 --> 00:33:28.479
Caption: who are allowed to think about the bear

00:33:26.798 --> 00:33:30.158
Caption: the whole time i&#39;m not going to be

00:33:28.479 --> 00:33:32.558
Caption: rebounding

00:33:30.159 --> 00:33:34.480
Caption: because i&#39;m allowing myself to think

00:33:32.558 --> 00:33:36.640
Caption: about it i&#39;m not trying to suppress that

00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:38.479
Caption: thought

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.000
Caption: the third thing

00:33:38.479 --> 00:33:42.479
Caption: is that i&#39;m just going to wait for 10

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.599
Caption: minutes so this is like making a low bar

00:33:42.479 --> 00:33:46.239
Caption: commitment to yourself with

00:33:43.599 --> 00:33:47.839
Caption: procrastination you just say

00:33:46.239 --> 00:33:49.760
Caption: i&#39;m going to wait for 10 minutes it&#39;s

00:33:47.839 --> 00:33:51.278
Caption: super easy to do

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.640
Caption: but actually

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:54.480
Caption: once you&#39;ve noticed the trigger and

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.719
Caption: you&#39;ve explored the feelings then the

00:33:54.479 --> 00:33:58.558
Caption: waiting is usually enough of a period to

00:33:56.719 --> 00:33:59.678
Caption: help you cool off

00:33:58.558 --> 00:34:01.119
Caption: right

00:33:59.678 --> 00:34:04.319
Caption: and you kind of know that you&#39;re not

00:34:01.119 --> 00:34:06.399
Caption: supposed to be getting distracted so

00:34:04.319 --> 00:34:08.638
Caption: it allows you to

00:34:06.399 --> 00:34:10.639
Caption: sit with those feelings but not have to

00:34:08.638 --> 00:34:12.319
Caption: feel guilty about them because you&#39;ve

00:34:10.638 --> 00:34:14.638
Caption: already made this bargain with yourself

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.959
Caption: if i wait for 10 minutes i still want to

00:34:14.638 --> 00:34:19.358
Caption: do the thing after i&#39;m allowed to do the

00:34:16.959 --> 00:34:21.280
Caption: thing i don&#39;t have to feel guilty when i

00:34:19.358 --> 00:34:23.598
Caption: do the thing because i already gave

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:26.079
Caption: myself permission i&#39;ve already worked

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:26.079
Caption: through that

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.439
Caption: excuse me

00:34:30.398 --> 00:34:33.520
Caption: all right

00:34:31.439 --> 00:34:36.239
Caption: now i just want to talk specifically

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.678
Caption: about distractions at work because i

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.520
Caption: think they look a little bit different

00:34:37.678 --> 00:34:41.199
Caption: to how distractions in your personal

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.000
Caption: life work

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:46.239
Caption: at work a lot of my distractions

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.239
Caption: kind of look a lot like plain old work

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:50.560
Caption: because that&#39;s mostly what they are

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:51.918
Caption: they&#39;re often a small task that&#39;s come

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.760
Caption: in

00:34:51.918 --> 00:34:55.918
Caption: it&#39;s often pretty urgent

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:58.399
Caption: it&#39;s often something that is low impact

00:34:55.918 --> 00:35:00.959
Caption: or low imp importance it&#39;s not usually

00:34:58.399 --> 00:35:03.520
Caption: the big strategic stuff that i&#39;m really

00:35:00.959 --> 00:35:05.598
Caption: trying to work towards

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:07.760
Caption: and because distraction is just as

00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:10.000
Caption: sneaky as procrastination

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.479
Caption: we think to ourselves oh yeah that is

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Caption: important i will just do that thing

00:35:12.479 --> 00:35:16.239
Caption: and where you end up

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.599
Caption: is in this cycle of churning stuff

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:20.159
Caption: through

00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:21.680
Caption: and switching tasks frequently

00:35:20.159 --> 00:35:23.598
Caption: now

00:35:21.679 --> 00:35:26.800
Caption: the reason this is a problem for me is

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:29.359
Caption: because i am easily distracted so if

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.679
Caption: someone sends me an email my instinct is

00:35:29.358 --> 00:35:34.319
Caption: to jump on what they do what they sent

00:35:31.679 --> 00:35:35.919
Caption: to me and do it straight away okay

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.479
Caption: so my problem at work was pretty much

00:35:35.919 --> 00:35:41.760
Caption: similar to in my personal life

00:35:38.479 --> 00:35:43.358
Caption: it was notifications notifications

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.639
Caption: and notifications

00:35:43.358 --> 00:35:46.959
Caption: because at work

00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:49.519
Caption: we have email obviously

00:35:46.959 --> 00:35:50.639
Caption: we have slack within our web team

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:53.040
Caption: we have

00:35:50.639 --> 00:35:55.519
Caption: asana for our broader communications

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.760
Caption: team so get task notifications and then

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.679
Caption: we use teams for the whole organization

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.399
Caption: and anyone can talk to me through that

00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:04.719
Caption: it&#39;s a lot of noise every day

00:36:02.399 --> 00:36:06.319
Caption: so as with my phone

00:36:04.719 --> 00:36:07.358
Caption: i change this up by just turning all

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.520
Caption: these off

00:36:07.358 --> 00:36:11.679
Caption: so i now check it probably like three to

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.479
Caption: five times a day check all of those

00:36:11.679 --> 00:36:14.000
Caption: channels

00:36:12.479 --> 00:36:16.159
Caption: and apart from that

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.919
Caption: i have outlook closed

00:36:16.159 --> 00:36:19.679
Caption: because if you just turn off the

00:36:17.919 --> 00:36:21.199
Caption: notifications you can still see there&#39;s

00:36:19.679 --> 00:36:23.598
Caption: a new email

00:36:21.199 --> 00:36:26.239
Caption: i explicitly have to quit teams in the

00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:28.000
Caption: system tray because if you just close it

00:36:26.239 --> 00:36:29.439
Caption: it looks like it&#39;s closed but if you get

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.959
Caption: a notification

00:36:29.439 --> 00:36:33.838
Caption: it pops up

00:36:30.959 --> 00:36:34.800
Caption: and then i have slack muted and then

00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:36.400
Caption: closed

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.119
Caption: because if you just close it you can

00:36:36.399 --> 00:36:40.719
Caption: still see a little notification badge

00:36:39.118 --> 00:36:42.959
Caption: and you can see what i was talking about

00:36:40.719 --> 00:36:44.239
Caption: before with this

00:36:42.959 --> 00:36:46.719
Caption: um

00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:48.639
Caption: apps trying to hook us in right

00:36:46.719 --> 00:36:50.639
Caption: i had to be quite ingenious with all

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:55.239
Caption: these things to try and stop them from

00:36:50.639 --> 00:36:55.239
Caption: being able to reach me and distract me

00:36:57.439 --> 00:37:01.760
Caption: um

00:36:59.439 --> 00:37:01.760
Caption: sorry

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:10.800
Caption: as for asana what i did with that was i

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.320
Caption: turned off the notifications in slack so

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.800
Caption: we had an integration it would send you

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:18.160
Caption: a message every time that happened

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:19.679
Caption: and then i set up a rule in my email to

00:37:18.159 --> 00:37:21.679
Caption: send all of the notifications to a

00:37:19.679 --> 00:37:23.078
Caption: folder that i never look at so there&#39;s

00:37:21.679 --> 00:37:25.679
Caption: now

00:37:23.079 --> 00:37:27.680
Caption: 1166 unread emails

00:37:25.679 --> 00:37:29.598
Caption: in that folder i&#39;m pretty proud of that

00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:31.199
Caption: thank you

00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:33.520
Caption: and the reason i didn&#39;t just disable

00:37:31.199 --> 00:37:35.358
Caption: them entirely is because assange&#39;s kind

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.439
Caption: of hard to use sometimes and sometimes

00:37:35.358 --> 00:37:39.358
Caption: that is the best way of finding

00:37:37.439 --> 00:37:40.879
Caption: something specific that i&#39;m looking for

00:37:39.358 --> 00:37:42.559
Caption: so didn&#39;t want to get rid of the emails

00:37:40.879 --> 00:37:45.598
Caption: altogether but i don&#39;t want them

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.320
Caption: cluttering up my inbox

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:48.880
Caption: so

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.280
Caption: does this seem pretty extreme

00:37:48.879 --> 00:37:53.838
Caption: it kind of seemed extreme to me

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.079
Caption: when i was first doing it so one of the

00:37:53.839 --> 00:37:58.640
Caption: key things was to manage other people&#39;s

00:37:56.079 --> 00:38:00.239
Caption: expectations so this is

00:37:58.639 --> 00:38:01.838
Caption: my leader

00:38:00.239 --> 00:38:04.000
Caption: our unit manager

00:38:01.839 --> 00:38:05.520
Caption: everyone else in the web team and then a

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.639
Caption: couple of other people that i support

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.239
Caption: frequently

00:38:06.639 --> 00:38:10.078
Caption: i told them that if they needed to get

00:38:08.239 --> 00:38:11.598
Caption: me urgently then they should pick up the

00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:14.000
Caption: phone and call me

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:16.160
Caption: and otherwise you can try your luck at

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.520
Caption: any time but i might not respond

00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:19.838
Caption: straight away

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:22.320
Caption: and actually it did raise a few eyebrows

00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:24.880
Caption: people were a bit like

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.760
Caption: so you&#39;re just not gonna let people talk

00:38:24.879 --> 00:38:27.759
Caption: to you about work

00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:32.000
Caption: but actually as it turns out people

00:38:30.399 --> 00:38:33.199
Caption: really ever notice that i&#39;m offline for

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.560
Caption: most of the day

00:38:33.199 --> 00:38:38.560
Caption: and nobody

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.560
Caption: has ever picked up the phone to call me

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.760
Caption: it seemed pretty daunting to me when i

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.399
Caption: was first doing it and i think that was

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:49.118
Caption: because i was in this always on always

00:38:46.399 --> 00:38:52.639
Caption: available mindset

00:38:49.118 --> 00:38:52.639
Caption: which i think a lot of us are right

00:38:53.358 --> 00:38:58.559
Caption: but it causes no inconvenience to anyone

00:38:55.839 --> 00:39:02.160
Caption: else and it does make me a lot more

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:04.000
Caption: effective at work because like i said

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:06.239
Caption: i&#39;m pretty easily distracted i will jump

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.239
Caption: on the nearest thing that came in

00:39:06.239 --> 00:39:10.479
Caption: and then also because it stops me from

00:39:08.239 --> 00:39:11.520
Caption: task switching so frequently

00:39:10.479 --> 00:39:12.800
Caption: and now this is where we&#39;re going to

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.719
Caption: come back to

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:17.839
Caption: why does it matter if i take 30 seconds

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:21.118
Caption: out of my day to reply to that email

00:39:17.839 --> 00:39:23.440
Caption: the reason it matters is because with

00:39:21.118 --> 00:39:26.239
Caption: frequent task switching you&#39;re actually

00:39:23.439 --> 00:39:28.399
Caption: raising your cognitive load okay so

00:39:26.239 --> 00:39:30.079
Caption: cognitive load means it&#39;s going to be

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:32.319
Caption: harder for you to focus back on your

00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:34.400
Caption: first task your brain is going to be

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:38.400
Caption: more tired and you&#39;re also going to be

00:39:34.399 --> 00:39:40.559
Caption: much more likely to make a mistake

00:39:38.399 --> 00:39:43.838
Caption: and that&#39;s a problem because i was doing

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.839
Caption: a lot of task switching

00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:48.880
Caption: i think being at work can feel like

00:39:46.879 --> 00:39:50.799
Caption: sharing out a single bucket of water

00:39:48.879 --> 00:39:52.799
Caption: amongst all the fires

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.400
Caption: that are surrounding you

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.320
Caption: and you give them all just enough to

00:39:54.399 --> 00:40:00.399
Caption: kind of keep them under control but it&#39;s

00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.400
Caption: not enough to douse them usually

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:07.239
Caption: and you end up task switching a lot

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.239
Caption: because you need to put out your fires

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:16.239
Caption: now

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.959
Caption: to address this problem which i was

00:40:16.239 --> 00:40:21.439
Caption: having a lot

00:40:18.959 --> 00:40:24.320
Caption: i further switched up my day i&#39;m going

00:40:21.439 --> 00:40:25.838
Caption: to show you now my task tracking

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.959
Caption: software

00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:30.880
Caption: and this is what it looked like before

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:32.639
Caption: i started doing all this stuff so you

00:40:30.879 --> 00:40:34.319
Caption: can see here

00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:35.358
Caption: i&#39;m doing i mean tuesday was pretty good

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.760
Caption: actually

00:40:35.358 --> 00:40:39.039
Caption: yay tuesday but like wednesday was a

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.320
Caption: complete mess

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.959
Caption: and these are all the tasks i&#39;m doing

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:46.079
Caption: i&#39;m doing like 11 minutes 25 minutes 26

00:40:42.959 --> 00:40:47.598
Caption: minutes 17 minutes 22 minutes is because

00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:49.440
Caption: i&#39;m still available to anyone and

00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:51.520
Caption: everyone at this time so i&#39;m getting

00:40:49.439 --> 00:40:53.679
Caption: emails in and replying to them

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.000
Caption: i&#39;m getting teams things

00:40:53.679 --> 00:40:59.358
Caption: i&#39;m also in the mindset of

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.358
Caption: i&#39;ll just get that out the way

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.839
Caption: right because i&#39;ve got a load of like

00:41:01.199 --> 00:41:05.760
Caption: very small tasks they&#39;re very minor i

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:07.119
Caption: can get those done really quickly

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.679
Caption: and then i&#39;ll get on with the rest of my

00:41:07.118 --> 00:41:12.078
Caption: day and actually what you can see here

00:41:09.679 --> 00:41:14.078
Caption: is that i&#39;m mostly not getting on with

00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:16.239
Caption: the rest of my day

00:41:14.079 --> 00:41:18.160
Caption: i&#39;m ending up

00:41:16.239 --> 00:41:20.719
Caption: not being able to focus really even that

00:41:18.159 --> 00:41:22.879
Caption: well in the afternoon either i&#39;m doing i

00:41:20.719 --> 00:41:24.879
Caption: mean especially wednesday

00:41:22.879 --> 00:41:26.799
Caption: what a problem but then all the rest of

00:41:24.879 --> 00:41:28.559
Caption: them i&#39;m still you know kind of managing

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.719
Caption: maybe an hour-ish a little bit more than

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.920
Caption: an hour and you can see where i&#39;m most

00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:34.239
Caption: effective

00:41:31.919 --> 00:41:37.118
Caption: is after 4 pm on friday and that&#39;s

00:41:34.239 --> 00:41:38.239
Caption: because nobody could talk to me

00:41:37.118 --> 00:41:40.559
Caption: and

00:41:38.239 --> 00:41:42.000
Caption: i&#39;m working well and truly past six

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.599
Caption: because i have a lot of stuff that i

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.919
Caption: didn&#39;t get to do this week because i was

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:46.960
Caption: doing all this other little crappy stuff

00:41:45.919 --> 00:41:49.520
Caption: okay

00:41:46.959 --> 00:41:51.439
Caption: so here&#39;s what it looked like after i

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.760
Caption: started implementing this so you can see

00:41:51.439 --> 00:41:55.358
Caption: i&#39;ve still got mostly quite a smallish

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:57.599
Caption: task up front

00:41:55.358 --> 00:41:59.679
Caption: and that&#39;s me doing my emails checking

00:41:57.599 --> 00:42:01.040
Caption: teams checking slack

00:41:59.679 --> 00:42:02.399
Caption: replying to anything that needs a bit of

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.880
Caption: back and forth

00:42:02.399 --> 00:42:06.239
Caption: and then i&#39;m also going into asana and

00:42:04.879 --> 00:42:07.838
Caption: planning my day

00:42:06.239 --> 00:42:09.358
Caption: and then i&#39;m jumping straight into the

00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:11.280
Caption: meaty stuff

00:42:09.358 --> 00:42:12.159
Caption: i&#39;m focusing for much longer periods of

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.919
Caption: time

00:42:12.159 --> 00:42:15.199
Caption: and then when i come back after lunch

00:42:13.919 --> 00:42:17.040
Caption: you can see

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:19.439
Caption: on some of the days like monday i&#39;m

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.520
Caption: still doing the little tasks

00:42:19.439 --> 00:42:23.919
Caption: but on other days i&#39;m doing a lot more

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.520
Caption: focus in the afternoon as well

00:42:23.919 --> 00:42:27.598
Caption: so it&#39;s like i&#39;m still surrounded by

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.719
Caption: fires but actually now i&#39;m just letting

00:42:27.599 --> 00:42:30.640
Caption: them burn

00:42:28.719 --> 00:42:32.000
Caption: and it turns out

00:42:30.639 --> 00:42:34.399
Caption: i didn&#39;t need to give them as much

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.239
Caption: attention as i was they actually coped

00:42:34.399 --> 00:42:37.598
Caption: just as well being left alone for a

00:42:36.239 --> 00:42:40.479
Caption: while

00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:42.880
Caption: the last thing i&#39;m going to finish with

00:42:40.479 --> 00:42:44.639
Caption: is a little bit of my asana so this is

00:42:42.879 --> 00:42:46.000
Caption: the six months before this is how many

00:42:44.639 --> 00:42:48.000
Caption: tasks i did

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.800
Caption: for context a task for us is anything

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.479
Caption: from like 15 minutes to four weeks so it

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.959
Caption: varies quite a lot

00:42:52.479 --> 00:42:57.598
Caption: i&#39;d say probably 60 of the tasks are

00:42:54.959 --> 00:42:59.439
Caption: probably one to six hours right

00:42:57.599 --> 00:43:03.040
Caption: so in the six months before i&#39;ve done

00:42:59.439 --> 00:43:04.959
Caption: 187 tasks this is about one and a

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:07.599
Caption: quarter tasks per day which is i don&#39;t

00:43:04.959 --> 00:43:09.679
Caption: know it seems kind of okay i&#39;m not sure

00:43:07.599 --> 00:43:11.280

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:16.160

00:44:19.199 --> 00:44:22.479

00:44:20.719 --> 00:44:24.239
Caption: that&#39;s deploying a new feature

00:44:22.479 --> 00:44:25.838

00:44:24.239 --> 00:44:27.520
Caption: that we&#39;re fully present when we&#39;re with

00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:29.119

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.159

00:44:30.159 --> 00:44:33.118

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:39.358
Caption: not by suppressing our thoughts which

00:44:37.599 --> 00:44:40.400
Caption: can lead to rebound

00:44:39.358 --> 00:44:42.399
Caption: but by

00:44:40.399 --> 00:44:44.559

00:44:49.358 --> 00:44:55.358

Caption: the answers that they gave on that

01:09:08.798 --> 01:09:12.238
Caption: facebook post

01:09:10.318 --> 01:09:13.678
Caption: so let&#39;s have a squeeze at some of the

01:09:12.238 --> 01:09:16.479
Caption: things that they are people said in the

01:09:13.679 --> 01:09:21.600
Caption: facebook post comments

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:24.159
Caption: so design is function made beautiful

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:28.000
Caption: design is the intentional creation of

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:31.759
Caption: amazing effortless artifacts

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.758
Caption: all that we see is design

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:37.838
Caption: design is how things work

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:40.318
Caption: look feel and are used

01:09:37.838 --> 01:09:41.358
Caption: so what comes to mind when you think of

01:09:40.318 --> 01:09:43.439
Caption: design

01:09:41.358 --> 01:09:45.919
Caption: so for some people it may mean things

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:48.479
Caption: like designing things like products

01:09:45.919 --> 01:09:50.158
Caption: websites apps graphics

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:52.238
Caption: or it might be to say the way that

01:09:50.159 --> 01:09:53.920
Caption: something looks or functions

01:09:52.238 --> 01:09:56.238
Caption: and you&#39;d be right these are all things

01:09:53.919 --> 01:09:59.120
Caption: that we refer to as design but there are

01:09:56.238 --> 01:10:01.279
Caption: only a few aspects of design

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:03.199
Caption: so about three years ago i was on mat

01:10:01.279 --> 01:10:05.599
Caption: leave and i was getting a bit antsy and

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:06.960
Caption: i wanted to sort of watch a few design

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.280
Caption: presentations

01:10:06.959 --> 01:10:12.080
Caption: and there was one by offering he&#39;s the

01:10:09.279 --> 01:10:14.158
Caption: chief design officer over at anz bank

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.760
Caption: and what he talked through was a

01:10:14.159 --> 01:10:18.159
Caption: framework that was developed by the

01:10:15.759 --> 01:10:21.359
Caption: carnegie carnegie school of mellon

01:10:18.159 --> 01:10:24.000
Caption: school of design in the 1990s and it

01:10:21.359 --> 01:10:25.600
Caption: talks about four orders of design

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.319
Caption: so these aren&#39;t levels there&#39;s no

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:30.479
Caption: hierarchy here but they&#39;re just four

01:10:28.319 --> 01:10:31.759
Caption: types of problem spaces that design can

01:10:30.479 --> 01:10:33.679
Caption: help with

01:10:31.759 --> 01:10:35.678
Caption: and i found it really useful in the way

01:10:33.679 --> 01:10:37.520
Caption: that it broke this broad concept of

01:10:35.679 --> 01:10:40.000
Caption: design into something that was just a

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.000
Caption: little bit easier to understand because

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.238
Caption: design at its core is about problem

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.520
Caption: solving

01:10:44.238 --> 01:10:49.678
Caption: so these are our four orders of design

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:52.799
Caption: they look based loosely around product

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:54.880
Caption: type and ordered around complexity level

01:10:52.799 --> 01:10:56.799
Caption: now this is all well and good but if you

01:10:54.879 --> 01:10:58.959
Caption: actually went up to a designer today and

01:10:56.799 --> 01:11:00.319
Caption: said hey what ordered you work in

01:10:58.959 --> 01:11:02.640
Caption: they&#39;ll probably look at you a little

01:11:00.319 --> 01:11:04.158
Caption: bit weird and have no idea what you were

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.560
Caption: talking about

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:08.640
Caption: so it&#39;s not something that designers uh

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.959
Caption: talk about in their day-to-day but it&#39;s

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:14.479
Caption: a great concept to help explain the

01:11:10.959 --> 01:11:14.479
Caption: broad landscape of design

01:11:14.799 --> 01:11:19.040
Caption: so our first order here is called

01:11:16.719 --> 01:11:21.280
Caption: symbols and this is all about visual

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:24.000
Caption: communication and it&#39;s most often the

01:11:21.279 --> 01:11:26.158
Caption: area that people associate with design

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.520
Caption: so this is all about the visual things

01:11:26.159 --> 01:11:30.159
Caption: people can see

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.679
Caption: so this has things like illustration

01:11:30.159 --> 01:11:34.000
Caption: typography

01:11:31.679 --> 01:11:35.199
Caption: photography posters all of that sort of

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.040
Caption: good stuff

01:11:35.199 --> 01:11:39.280
Caption: and it&#39;s everything that&#39;s related to

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:43.120
Caption: the world of graphic design visual

01:11:39.279 --> 01:11:43.119
Caption: design and information design

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:47.360
Caption: our second order here is called products

01:11:45.199 --> 01:11:49.520
Caption: and this is where objects are this is

01:11:47.359 --> 01:11:50.879
Caption: includes objects that people physically

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.319
Caption: interact with

01:11:50.879 --> 01:11:56.319
Caption: this is where form and function meet

01:11:54.319 --> 01:11:58.238
Caption: it&#39;s a world of product design and

01:11:56.319 --> 01:12:00.399
Caption: industrial design

01:11:58.238 --> 01:12:02.238
Caption: and just to confuse things a little bit

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:04.560
Caption: more because everybody&#39;s already

01:12:02.238 --> 01:12:07.039
Caption: confused about design so hey ho

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:09.839
Caption: um physical product design does not

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:13.199
Caption: equal digital product design so this

01:12:09.839 --> 01:12:15.678
Caption: sits in our next order which is

01:12:13.199 --> 01:12:17.760
Caption: our order of interactions

01:12:15.679 --> 01:12:20.320
Caption: and this deals with the experience of

01:12:17.759 --> 01:12:22.158
Caption: people and things over time

01:12:20.319 --> 01:12:23.759
Caption: so it&#39;s often tied in with our first

01:12:22.159 --> 01:12:26.159
Caption: order of design and that&#39;s where you see

01:12:23.759 --> 01:12:29.279
Caption: your user interface elements appear

01:12:26.159 --> 01:12:31.199
Caption: but it delivers on interactions services

01:12:29.279 --> 01:12:33.759
Caption: and experiences

01:12:31.199 --> 01:12:36.400
Caption: so this is our world of service design

01:12:33.759 --> 01:12:40.238
Caption: user experience design ux design

01:12:36.399 --> 01:12:40.238
Caption: or and digital product design

01:12:40.959 --> 01:12:45.600
Caption: and now we&#39;re in our fourth order this

01:12:43.199 --> 01:12:47.679
Caption: is called systems and this is our most

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.359
Caption: complex order of all and we&#39;re in in

01:12:47.679 --> 01:12:50.560
Caption: this we&#39;re designing for things like

01:12:49.359 --> 01:12:52.479
Caption: businesses

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:53.600
Caption: learning experiences

01:12:52.479 --> 01:12:54.718
Caption: systems

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:57.280
Caption: cultures

01:12:54.719 --> 01:12:59.600
Caption: organizations and even cities

01:12:57.279 --> 01:13:01.839
Caption: so this is a this is about how groups of

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.600
Caption: people and things interact with other

01:13:01.839 --> 01:13:05.439
Caption: groups of people and things

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.600
Caption: and this is our world of strategic

01:13:05.439 --> 01:13:09.678
Caption: design business design and

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.359
Caption: organizational design

01:13:09.679 --> 01:13:13.199
Caption: now this is all well and good and i

01:13:11.359 --> 01:13:16.479
Caption: always love a good framework but let&#39;s

01:13:13.199 --> 01:13:16.479
Caption: have a look at this in action

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.159
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk about apple

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.159
Caption: okay so

01:13:20.159 --> 01:13:25.199
Caption: um i&#39;ve done this i&#39;ve practiced this

01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:27.040
Caption: talk a few times and uh i&#39;ve had some

01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:29.760
Caption: positive and negative reactions whenever

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:32.319
Caption: i mention apple to people so um can i

01:13:29.759 --> 01:13:35.359
Caption: get a hands up for who&#39;s an apple fan in

01:13:32.319 --> 01:13:37.359
Caption: the audience who digs apple here

01:13:35.359 --> 01:13:39.040
Caption: got a few people thought they might be

01:13:37.359 --> 01:13:41.839
Caption: coming to a design talk

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.640
Caption: who&#39;s not a fan who&#39;s like boo hiss bad

01:13:41.839 --> 01:13:44.799
Caption: apple

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.800
Caption: yeah

01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:49.600
Caption: and who&#39;s ambivalent who&#39;s like

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.199
Caption: yeah awesome okay we&#39;ve got a good

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.600
Caption: mixture in here so this is going to be

01:13:51.199 --> 01:13:55.120
Caption: good um this isn&#39;t sponsored by apple by

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.719
Caption: the way but if anybody is in the

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:59.760
Caption: audience like i&#39;m always open to some

01:13:56.719 --> 01:14:01.040
Caption: freebies so that&#39;s good

01:13:59.759 --> 01:14:02.639
Caption: so we&#39;re going to go back into our

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:04.799
Caption: orders here we&#39;re going to talk about

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:07.919
Caption: our first orders order of design which

01:14:04.799 --> 01:14:10.879
Caption: is symbols or visual communication

01:14:07.919 --> 01:14:12.718
Caption: so in the 1990s apple was actually in a

01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:14.718
Caption: pretty bad state people actually thought

01:14:12.719 --> 01:14:17.360
Caption: the company was going to go under

01:14:14.719 --> 01:14:20.640
Caption: there was no iphone there was no ipod

01:14:17.359 --> 01:14:23.198
Caption: there was no ipad no imac and then while

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.880
Caption: steve jobs waited on these products to

01:14:23.199 --> 01:14:26.960
Caption: launch he wanted something that would

01:14:24.879 --> 01:14:29.359
Caption: remind people about the qualities that

01:14:26.959 --> 01:14:31.279
Caption: were called to the apple brand

01:14:29.359 --> 01:14:33.520
Caption: and this is where our think different

01:14:31.279 --> 01:14:35.759
Caption: campaign uh comes in

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.439
Caption: so here you&#39;ll see one of the print ads

01:14:35.759 --> 01:14:39.279
Caption: that was uh that was created and there

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:41.198
Caption: were a whole series of print ads that

01:14:39.279 --> 01:14:42.559
Caption: went with this as well as a television

01:14:41.199 --> 01:14:45.120
Caption: commercial

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.120
Caption: and it&#39;s really powerful because here

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.280
Caption: you can because of the emotions and

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:51.840
Caption: memories that this actually conveys so

01:14:49.279 --> 01:14:53.599
Caption: there&#39;s no product shots here there&#39;s no

01:14:51.839 --> 01:14:56.399
Caption: talk of any product benefits there&#39;s

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:59.199
Caption: just three things a historical figure

01:14:56.399 --> 01:15:00.399
Caption: the apple logo and the words think

01:14:59.199 --> 01:15:03.040
Caption: different

01:15:00.399 --> 01:15:05.359
Caption: so this is a branding campaign pure and

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:09.640
Caption: simple and it&#39;s one of the most popular

01:15:05.359 --> 01:15:09.639
Caption: apple campaigns to this day

01:15:10.159 --> 01:15:14.400
Caption: so now we&#39;re looking at our second order

01:15:12.238 --> 01:15:16.399
Caption: here and this is our order of products

01:15:14.399 --> 01:15:18.640
Caption: or physical objects

01:15:16.399 --> 01:15:20.879
Caption: so here we&#39;re designing two a broader

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:23.439
Caption: set of challenges which might mean

01:15:20.879 --> 01:15:26.799
Caption: materials supply chain logistics do i

01:15:23.439 --> 01:15:29.279
Caption: need to change my microphone yep

01:15:26.799 --> 01:15:29.279
Caption: that&#39;s okay

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:41.199
Caption: which is good okay cool

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:42.879
Caption: um right here we are designing to a

01:15:41.199 --> 01:15:45.040
Caption: broader set of challenges so you&#39;re

01:15:42.879 --> 01:15:48.238
Caption: looking at things like materials supply

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:49.439
Caption: chain logistics ergonomics packaging and

01:15:48.238 --> 01:15:51.279
Caption: more

01:15:49.439 --> 01:15:53.198
Caption: so the apple packaging itself is a

01:15:51.279 --> 01:15:55.198
Caption: sensory experience your first

01:15:53.199 --> 01:15:56.640
Caption: interaction with this thing is actually

01:15:55.199 --> 01:15:58.800
Caption: how it looks

01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:00.880
Caption: pack this packaging is designed to be as

01:15:58.799 --> 01:16:02.639
Caption: visually appealing as the thing that

01:16:00.879 --> 01:16:06.080
Caption: sits inside it

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:08.159
Caption: so every line on this box is clean it&#39;s

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:10.399
Caption: elegant it&#39;s minimalist it&#39;s white

01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:11.600
Caption: packaging it&#39;s simple in a world of

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:13.839
Caption: clutter

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:16.000
Caption: so apple actually pay attention as much

01:16:13.839 --> 01:16:17.439
Caption: attention to the small stuff as they do

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.919
Caption: the big stuff

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:23.040
Caption: so that box that gets the same amount of

01:16:19.919 --> 01:16:24.799
Caption: attention as the device inside it

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:27.040
Caption: so did you know that there&#39;s actually a

01:16:24.799 --> 01:16:30.238
Caption: designer or designers that are employed

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:31.919
Caption: to create design and test hundreds of

01:16:30.238 --> 01:16:34.559
Caption: prototype boxes

01:16:31.919 --> 01:16:36.799
Caption: so this just isn&#39;t about aesthetics here

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:39.280
Caption: it&#39;s also about a package that&#39;s easy

01:16:36.799 --> 01:16:41.520
Caption: for customers to open it&#39;s easy for them

01:16:39.279 --> 01:16:44.399
Caption: to identify the components parts inside

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.479
Caption: it and it&#39;s easy for them to start using

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:48.718
Caption: so it&#39;s a process that&#39;s focused first

01:16:46.479 --> 01:16:50.799
Caption: and foremost on the customer it&#39;s not

01:16:48.719 --> 01:16:53.440
Caption: focused on for example to prevent

01:16:50.799 --> 01:16:53.439
Caption: shoplifting

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.799
Caption: now we&#39;re getting into our third order

01:16:55.439 --> 01:16:58.959
Caption: here and this is our order of

01:16:56.799 --> 01:17:00.718
Caption: interactions and services now i&#39;m going

01:16:58.959 --> 01:17:02.399
Caption: to spend a little bit more time talking

01:17:00.719 --> 01:17:03.920
Caption: about this order because it&#39;s probably

01:17:02.399 --> 01:17:06.158
Caption: where most of your designers will

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:07.919
Caption: actually be working in

01:17:06.159 --> 01:17:10.479
Caption: so we&#39;re going to think about the

01:17:07.919 --> 01:17:12.238
Caption: experience of buying from an apple store

01:17:10.479 --> 01:17:13.520
Caption: from a physical store

01:17:12.238 --> 01:17:14.799
Caption: so you&#39;re going to have a trigger

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.199
Caption: there&#39;s going to be something that makes

01:17:14.799 --> 01:17:19.119
Caption: you want to buy that apple product

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:21.440
Caption: maybe it&#39;s an ad that you&#39;ve seen maybe

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:23.760
Caption: it&#39;s a friend of a family member that

01:17:21.439 --> 01:17:26.000
Caption: you&#39;ve been recommended it from

01:17:23.759 --> 01:17:28.319
Caption: you&#39;ll do some research you&#39;ll make your

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.439
Caption: way to the store maybe you&#39;re catching a

01:17:28.319 --> 01:17:31.040
Caption: train

01:17:29.439 --> 01:17:33.040
Caption: you&#39;ll enter the store you&#39;ll talk to

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:35.040
Caption: somebody about what you&#39;re after you&#39;ll

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.640
Caption: purchase your apple product you&#39;ll leave

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.839
Caption: the store you&#39;ll go home you&#39;ll open up

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:40.239
Caption: the box

01:17:37.839 --> 01:17:42.319
Caption: so this whole end-to-end experience and

01:17:40.238 --> 01:17:44.479
Caption: these touch points and interactions and

01:17:42.319 --> 01:17:46.319
Caption: emotions that are what we&#39;re designing

01:17:44.479 --> 01:17:48.399
Caption: for in this order

01:17:46.319 --> 01:17:50.879
Caption: so in this order our designers look at

01:17:48.399 --> 01:17:54.399
Caption: three main areas we&#39;ve got people

01:17:50.879 --> 01:17:54.399
Caption: process and technology

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:59.040
Caption: so first of all the people so it&#39;s not

01:17:57.199 --> 01:18:00.880
Caption: just about the customers but the people

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:02.959
Caption: that work at apple

01:18:00.879 --> 01:18:05.600
Caption: this is about maintaining empathy for

01:18:02.959 --> 01:18:08.000
Caption: everybody that&#39;s involved in the process

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.080
Caption: and so by trying to understand all sides

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.759
Caption: we can make human-centered critical

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:15.919
Caption: decisions in designing the experience

01:18:13.759 --> 01:18:18.000
Caption: and we also look at process so these are

01:18:15.919 --> 01:18:19.120
Caption: the standard procedures to operate a

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.359
Caption: business

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.560
Caption: so for this apple example we&#39;ll look at

01:18:21.359 --> 01:18:24.319
Caption: things like

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:26.239
Caption: how do the staff talk and interact with

01:18:24.319 --> 01:18:27.439
Caption: the customers so what are their selling

01:18:26.238 --> 01:18:29.359
Caption: tactics

01:18:27.439 --> 01:18:31.520
Caption: how are the staff rusted on for example

01:18:29.359 --> 01:18:33.198
Caption: what happens during peak hours

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.279
Caption: and what are the different roles in the

01:18:33.199 --> 01:18:37.679
Caption: store who does what

01:18:35.279 --> 01:18:39.359
Caption: and by understanding the current process

01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:41.280
Caption: and the business requirements we can

01:18:39.359 --> 01:18:42.959
Caption: align and arm people in the business

01:18:41.279 --> 01:18:46.079
Caption: with the knowledge and the tools to help

01:18:42.959 --> 01:18:46.080
Caption: improve the experience

01:18:46.319 --> 01:18:49.839
Caption: and the third one we look at is

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.439
Caption: technology so what&#39;s needed to deliver

01:18:49.839 --> 01:18:52.158
Caption: the experience

01:18:51.439 --> 01:18:54.319
Caption: so

01:18:52.159 --> 01:18:56.640
Caption: what technology is apple using to help

01:18:54.319 --> 01:18:58.158
Caption: deliver the service seamlessly so do

01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.719
Caption: they have an efficient point of sale

01:18:58.159 --> 01:19:03.040
Caption: system are we tracking deliveries once

01:19:00.719 --> 01:19:04.800
Caption: they leave the store or the warehouse we

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.560
Caption: look at technology so we can actually

01:19:04.799 --> 01:19:08.718
Caption: understand what are the touch points to

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:12.800
Caption: deliver the service and what can be done

01:19:08.719 --> 01:19:12.800
Caption: to deliver a better improved service

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:17.040
Caption: now we&#39;re getting into our fourth order

01:19:15.439 --> 01:19:19.120
Caption: this is our fourth order of design where

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:20.560
Caption: we&#39;re reaching into business design and

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:23.760
Caption: innovation

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:25.919
Caption: so apple is in fact a service business

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:28.079
Caption: it&#39;s got everything from the app store

01:19:25.919 --> 01:19:30.959
Caption: too and i&#39;m going to take a breath here

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:34.000
Caption: apple news apple books apple tv apple

01:19:30.959 --> 01:19:36.640
Caption: movies apple music apple pay iclouds

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.319
Caption: itunes and much more all right so this

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:41.439
Caption: is where it gets its revenue so it&#39;s not

01:19:38.319 --> 01:19:44.079
Caption: just about selling laptops and phones

01:19:41.439 --> 01:19:46.319
Caption: it&#39;s about selling people constant

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:48.560
Caption: ongoing subscriptions for the things

01:19:46.319 --> 01:19:50.799
Caption: that they can do on their devices

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:53.520
Caption: it&#39;s an ecosystem that&#39;s designed to

01:19:50.799 --> 01:19:55.520
Caption: suck you in and never let you leave so

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:57.439
Caption: by buying that iphone it&#39;s almost like

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:59.439
Caption: that gateway drug into the apple

01:19:57.439 --> 01:20:02.238
Caption: experience

01:19:59.439 --> 01:20:04.479
Caption: so apple innovate through reinvention

01:20:02.238 --> 01:20:06.799
Caption: and they just make it slick

01:20:04.479 --> 01:20:08.959
Caption: so they want to take innovation to the

01:20:06.799 --> 01:20:11.599
Caption: next level by making its product

01:20:08.959 --> 01:20:15.198
Caption: features better and to work seamlessly

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:15.199
Caption: across multiple devices

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:22.000
Caption: so this leads us to now how apple

01:20:19.279 --> 01:20:25.439
Caption: designs their business for innovation

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.839
Caption: so in 1997 uh when jobs returned to

01:20:25.439 --> 01:20:29.279
Caption: apple this had a conventional structure

01:20:27.839 --> 01:20:31.520
Caption: this is a structure that you see on the

01:20:29.279 --> 01:20:33.198
Caption: left here it was divided into those

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.359
Caption: business units

01:20:33.199 --> 01:20:37.120
Caption: so he changed it to the structure on the

01:20:35.359 --> 01:20:38.959
Caption: right where the organization was

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:42.000
Caption: restructured to align to areas of

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:45.520
Caption: expertise and since tim cook has taken

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.159
Caption: over it has changed slightly again

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:50.080
Caption: so they rely on organizational design to

01:20:48.159 --> 01:20:52.080
Caption: have a crucial part in the success for

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:54.879
Caption: innovation where they&#39;re able to compete

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:59.120
Caption: with other companies like google samsung

01:20:54.879 --> 01:20:59.120
Caption: microsoft ibm and many more

01:20:59.679 --> 01:21:03.760
Caption: but if you&#39;re anything like me

01:21:01.759 --> 01:21:04.479
Caption: you probably still have questions

01:21:03.759 --> 01:21:05.839
Caption: like

01:21:04.479 --> 01:21:08.159
Caption: when did things start getting so

01:21:05.839 --> 01:21:09.839
Caption: complicated when do we start needing all

01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:11.439
Caption: of these different types of designers

01:21:09.839 --> 01:21:15.040
Caption: and when did they start popping up in

01:21:11.439 --> 01:21:18.080
Caption: all of these different organizations

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:20.719
Caption: so i blame the year 2013 right so i want

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:22.640
Caption: you to think back to 2013 and think

01:21:20.719 --> 01:21:24.880
Caption: about what you were doing

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:26.959
Caption: it was almost a decade ago

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:29.678
Caption: it was a very non-pandemic type of time

01:21:26.959 --> 01:21:32.080
Caption: it was a much simpler time back then

01:21:29.679 --> 01:21:33.440
Caption: but it&#39;s got a lot to answer for

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.879
Caption: now i didn&#39;t know if i&#39;d be losing

01:21:33.439 --> 01:21:37.120
Caption: people at this point so you&#39;ve hit the

01:21:34.879 --> 01:21:38.399
Caption: funny gif and meme section of my talk

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.360
Caption: which is cool

01:21:38.399 --> 01:21:42.640
Caption: so

01:21:39.359 --> 01:21:44.560
Caption: 2013 was when this guy came into office

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:47.760
Caption: so he was our 28th prime minister like i

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:49.760
Caption: said 2013 had a lot to answer for um

01:21:47.759 --> 01:21:52.079
Caption: thanks to miley twerking first entered

01:21:49.759 --> 01:21:54.638
Caption: the oxford dictionary so that&#39;s actually

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:56.239
Caption: in the dictionary now thanks to her

01:21:54.639 --> 01:21:58.560
Caption: the worst wedding ever happened on game

01:21:56.238 --> 01:22:00.479
Caption: of thrones uh my partner&#39;s now making me

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:02.399
Caption: re-watch all the game of thrones uh

01:22:00.479 --> 01:22:03.520
Caption: series at the moment so i thought that

01:22:02.399 --> 01:22:06.879
Caption: was quite apt

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:09.199
Caption: um and back in 2013 i read a wide

01:22:06.879 --> 01:22:11.439
Caption: magazine article which at the time i

01:22:09.199 --> 01:22:13.600
Caption: didn&#39;t think too much of i thought i

01:22:11.439 --> 01:22:15.040
Caption: thought that&#39;s interesting i wonder

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.919
Caption: what&#39;s going to happen off of that and

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:20.399
Caption: just sort of moved on with my day

01:22:17.919 --> 01:22:22.080
Caption: but little did i know that that was

01:22:20.399 --> 01:22:24.638
Caption: actually a key moment in terms of what

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:27.280
Caption: design meant or represented to

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:27.280
Caption: businesses

01:22:27.759 --> 01:22:33.039
Caption: so this is what it was entitled it was

01:22:30.319 --> 01:22:35.759
Caption: called big corporations are buying

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:38.239
Caption: design firms in droves

01:22:35.759 --> 01:22:41.198
Caption: right and the first opening line in this

01:22:38.238 --> 01:22:44.879
Caption: was the significance of does of design

01:22:41.199 --> 01:22:44.880
Caption: in business is ballooning

01:22:44.959 --> 01:22:50.319
Caption: so 2013 is the year that accenture a

01:22:48.399 --> 01:22:52.879
Caption: global consulting firm

01:22:50.319 --> 01:22:54.638
Caption: buys design giant fjord so fjord are a

01:22:52.879 --> 01:22:56.638
Caption: london-based global design and

01:22:54.639 --> 01:22:58.719
Caption: innovation firm

01:22:56.639 --> 01:23:00.959
Caption: now bigger companies have been acquiring

01:22:58.719 --> 01:23:03.600
Caption: smaller companies since forever

01:23:00.959 --> 01:23:05.520
Caption: but it was about this time that design

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.320
Caption: agencies and firms started to become

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:10.719
Caption: acquired by large consultant companies

01:23:08.319 --> 01:23:14.319
Caption: and so it wasn&#39;t just large advertising

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:14.320
Caption: marketing and creative groups

01:23:14.479 --> 01:23:20.639
Caption: and so fast forward to today so design

01:23:17.919 --> 01:23:22.560
Caption: has changed it&#39;s now being recognized by

01:23:20.639 --> 01:23:24.479
Caption: companies and businesses as something

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:26.399
Caption: that can provide better business and

01:23:24.479 --> 01:23:28.080
Caption: customer outcomes

01:23:26.399 --> 01:23:29.839
Caption: and so what this means is now we&#39;re

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.839
Caption: seeing a change in the type of designers

01:23:29.839 --> 01:23:33.678
Caption: that we&#39;re seeing in organizations so

01:23:31.839 --> 01:23:36.399
Caption: say about 10 years ago they were much

01:23:33.679 --> 01:23:38.560
Caption: more visual digital and web designers

01:23:36.399 --> 01:23:42.399
Caption: and now you&#39;re seeing more strategic

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:42.399
Caption: experience and service designers

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:47.600
Caption: so what does this mean for you right the

01:23:46.399 --> 01:23:50.000
Caption: projects that you work on and the

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:51.520
Caption: designers that you actually work with

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.679
Caption: so it not only comes down to

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:55.839
Caption: understanding what is design all of

01:23:53.679 --> 01:23:57.280
Caption: those cool for four orders that we&#39;ve

01:23:55.839 --> 01:23:59.119
Caption: just gone through

01:23:57.279 --> 01:24:01.520
Caption: but it&#39;s about getting a rough idea of

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:03.520
Caption: what the design process is like and

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:05.600
Caption: where different designers can crop up in

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:07.679
Caption: your process

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:10.320
Caption: now when we talk through the process

01:24:07.679 --> 01:24:12.159
Caption: today i&#39;ll mainly be talking through our

01:24:10.319 --> 01:24:14.560
Caption: third order of design so this is mainly

01:24:12.159 --> 01:24:17.280
Caption: when we&#39;re dealing with ux designers

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:19.760
Caption: service designers product designers etc

01:24:17.279 --> 01:24:21.678
Caption: so this is my area the area that i sit

01:24:19.759 --> 01:24:23.198
Caption: in and most of the uh like i said before

01:24:21.679 --> 01:24:26.000
Caption: where most of your designers will

01:24:23.199 --> 01:24:26.000
Caption: probably sit in

01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:28.320
Caption: so

01:24:26.959 --> 01:24:30.159
Caption: this is what it looks like when you&#39;ve

01:24:28.319 --> 01:24:32.158
Caption: got designers usually explaining design

01:24:30.159 --> 01:24:34.000
Caption: processes we tend to look a little bit

01:24:32.159 --> 01:24:36.080
Caption: like that

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.759
Caption: it does feel like there&#39;s like a million

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:40.000
Caption: different design frameworks and

01:24:37.759 --> 01:24:42.158
Caption: methodologies out there out there that

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.479
Caption: step through this process but

01:24:42.159 --> 01:24:47.360
Caption: um but the easiest one and the most

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:49.600
Caption: common one we tend to refer to

01:24:47.359 --> 01:24:51.359
Caption: is our good old double diamond and this

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:53.199
Caption: is great because you can chuck in double

01:24:51.359 --> 01:24:55.600
Caption: diamond into google and this you know is

01:24:53.199 --> 01:24:58.560
Caption: generally what you&#39;ll get back so

01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.879
Caption: um it was done in 2004 it was created by

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.560
Caption: the uk design council

01:25:00.879 --> 01:25:04.560
Caption: um and it&#39;s very well known with

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:06.319
Caption: designers so if you ever want to talk to

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.280
Caption: a designer about this they can run you

01:25:06.319 --> 01:25:09.678
Caption: through it

01:25:07.279 --> 01:25:12.399
Caption: so it basically describes our two modes

01:25:09.679 --> 01:25:13.840
Caption: of thinking that we do as designers this

01:25:12.399 --> 01:25:16.479
Caption: is where we&#39;re going wide we&#39;re

01:25:13.839 --> 01:25:16.479
Caption: diverging

01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:21.119
Caption: and then we&#39;ll converge and we&#39;ll go

01:25:18.799 --> 01:25:21.119
Caption: narrow

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:26.719
Caption: might be a new speaker post who knows um

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:28.960
Caption: so the first assignment is really about

01:25:26.719 --> 01:25:30.880
Caption: if we&#39;re figuring out if we&#39;re doing the

01:25:28.959 --> 01:25:32.639
Caption: right things right so this is why we&#39;re

01:25:30.879 --> 01:25:34.319
Caption: going to go right wide with our

01:25:32.639 --> 01:25:36.320
Caption: discovery search

01:25:34.319 --> 01:25:38.319
Caption: we&#39;re going to converge and we&#39;re going

01:25:36.319 --> 01:25:41.119
Caption: to go narrow we&#39;re going to define our

01:25:38.319 --> 01:25:42.879
Caption: research themes our insights and our

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.159
Caption: opportunity areas

01:25:42.879 --> 01:25:46.399
Caption: and then we&#39;re going to go into our

01:25:44.159 --> 01:25:48.800
Caption: second diamond so this is about building

01:25:46.399 --> 01:25:51.279
Caption: the things right so we go wide we

01:25:48.799 --> 01:25:53.198
Caption: diverge we go wide with our ideas we&#39;re

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:54.879
Caption: starting to set the design vision and

01:25:53.199 --> 01:25:56.400
Caption: north star and then we&#39;re going to

01:25:54.879 --> 01:25:57.839
Caption: converge and we&#39;re going to go narrow

01:25:56.399 --> 01:25:59.678
Caption: and this is where we&#39;re prototyping

01:25:57.839 --> 01:26:01.678
Caption: we&#39;re testing we&#39;re learning we&#39;re

01:25:59.679 --> 01:26:05.520
Caption: iterating we&#39;re rinsing and repeating

01:26:01.679 --> 01:26:08.000
Caption: until huzzah we have our solution

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:10.799
Caption: but i have a problem with this approach

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.040
Caption: it&#39;s too design centric

01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:14.319
Caption: i think it&#39;s useful because it gives all

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.439
Caption: the good stuff that you get with

01:26:14.319 --> 01:26:19.198
Caption: converging and diverging etc but it

01:26:17.439 --> 01:26:21.439
Caption: suggests that we&#39;ve actually got a final

01:26:19.199 --> 01:26:24.159
Caption: solution at the end that it sets up the

01:26:21.439 --> 01:26:26.238
Caption: expectation that everything&#39;s completed

01:26:24.159 --> 01:26:28.159
Caption: and it&#39;s handed off for implementation

01:26:26.238 --> 01:26:31.519
Caption: to our dev teams

01:26:28.159 --> 01:26:34.400
Caption: that last diamond is way too simplified

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:37.279
Caption: in the real world of delivery

01:26:34.399 --> 01:26:40.000
Caption: so this is why i personally prefer the

01:26:37.279 --> 01:26:43.520
Caption: triple diamond which was produced by

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.679
Caption: zendesk and this is what it looks like

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:48.000
Caption: so at the start of our third diamond

01:26:45.679 --> 01:26:50.159
Caption: here we&#39;re confident it&#39;s the right

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.479
Caption: solution at this point we&#39;ve gone

01:26:50.159 --> 01:26:54.959
Caption: through our discovery process and we

01:26:52.479 --> 01:26:56.159
Caption: know it&#39;s there but it needs further

01:26:54.959 --> 01:26:58.080
Caption: refinement

01:26:56.159 --> 01:27:00.000
Caption: so let&#39;s zoom into this last diamond a

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.600
Caption: little bit more

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.600
Caption: there we go

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:05.840
Caption: this diamond actually marks the start of

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.439
Caption: our agile sprints where we&#39;re building

01:27:05.839 --> 01:27:10.959
Caption: our products through to our launch and

01:27:07.439 --> 01:27:12.799
Caption: it&#39;s not about doing a handoff

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:14.560
Caption: here we&#39;re refining and we&#39;re filling in

01:27:12.799 --> 01:27:15.919
Caption: more details as we&#39;re progressing

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:18.080
Caption: through our sprints

01:27:15.919 --> 01:27:19.919
Caption: and our des are investigating technical

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:21.600
Caption: solutions while our designers are

01:27:19.919 --> 01:27:24.238
Caption: creating prototypes and conducting

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:26.080
Caption: usability tests

01:27:24.238 --> 01:27:28.479
Caption: and as we progress we can see the

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:32.560
Caption: uncertainty is decreasing over time and

01:27:28.479 --> 01:27:34.718
Caption: we&#39;re honing into that right solution

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.399
Caption: and we&#39;re still testing throughout just

01:27:34.719 --> 01:27:38.080
Caption: to see how customers are responding

01:27:36.399 --> 01:27:39.120
Caption: through our product so this test and

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.639
Caption: respond

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.639
Caption: and we&#39;re tweaking accordingly

01:27:43.279 --> 01:27:46.879
Caption: and as we progress uncertainty is

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:50.399
Caption: decreasing over time and we&#39;re starting

01:27:46.879 --> 01:27:52.718
Caption: to hone into that right solution

01:27:50.399 --> 01:27:54.000
Caption: now we should be refining our solution

01:27:52.719 --> 01:27:56.159
Caption: as we&#39;re progressing we&#39;re really

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.719
Caption: starting to hone in but towards the end

01:27:56.159 --> 01:28:00.479
Caption: that flexibility for change decreases

01:27:58.719 --> 01:28:02.239
Caption: and at the end it&#39;s that last little

01:28:00.479 --> 01:28:04.319
Caption: bits of optimizations that we&#39;re

01:28:02.238 --> 01:28:05.599
Caption: actually accounting for

01:28:04.319 --> 01:28:07.198
Caption: now it&#39;s important to remember and

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.840
Caption: anyone that&#39;s been involved in this

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:12.159
Caption: process it&#39;s never linear

01:28:09.839 --> 01:28:13.919
Caption: it feels a little bit messy sometimes

01:28:12.159 --> 01:28:15.679
Caption: sometimes there&#39;s features that you may

01:28:13.919 --> 01:28:18.560
Caption: discover that need to go back into the

01:28:15.679 --> 01:28:20.639
Caption: discovery process for example

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.719
Caption: so now we&#39;ve got a good understanding of

01:28:20.639 --> 01:28:24.560
Caption: the process let&#39;s talk about some of the

01:28:22.719 --> 01:28:26.840
Caption: different designers you&#39;ll get across

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:29.120
Caption: this process and where do they

01:28:26.839 --> 01:28:30.399
Caption: sit i&#39;m going to take a bit of water

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.719
Caption: here just

01:28:30.399 --> 01:28:32.718
Caption: hold on

01:28:33.679 --> 01:28:36.159
Caption: right

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:38.399
Caption: so now we&#39;re back into our triple

01:28:36.159 --> 01:28:41.120
Caption: diamond the full triple diamond

01:28:38.399 --> 01:28:43.198
Caption: and here is an example of what our hbf

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:44.800
Caption: projects look like and how our designers

01:28:43.199 --> 01:28:46.719
Caption: sit in the process

01:28:44.799 --> 01:28:49.119
Caption: so we&#39;re actually in that last little

01:28:46.719 --> 01:28:51.280
Caption: validation stage at the moment

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.959
Caption: so our service designers and our ux

01:28:51.279 --> 01:28:55.759
Caption: researchers are performing heuristic

01:28:52.959 --> 01:28:58.080
Caption: reviews and assessments with some squads

01:28:55.759 --> 01:29:01.359
Caption: and our in squad product designers our

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:02.879
Caption: ux uis are working through bug fixes and

01:29:01.359 --> 01:29:05.279
Caption: improvements

01:29:02.879 --> 01:29:07.919
Caption: so as a team we&#39;re actually honing in on

01:29:05.279 --> 01:29:10.479
Caption: our final solution but our flexibility

01:29:07.919 --> 01:29:14.238
Caption: for changes definitely decreasing as

01:29:10.479 --> 01:29:14.238
Caption: we&#39;re getting closer to our roll out

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:19.439
Caption: so let&#39;s talk about collaborating with

01:29:17.279 --> 01:29:21.520
Caption: designers in this process

01:29:19.439 --> 01:29:23.919
Caption: so it&#39;s really important to remember

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:26.639
Caption: that designers don&#39;t hold the monopoly

01:29:23.919 --> 01:29:28.560
Caption: over how we design and build products or

01:29:26.639 --> 01:29:30.400
Caption: even how we innovate

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:32.639
Caption: remember we need to collaborate with our

01:29:30.399 --> 01:29:36.158
Caption: experts with you guys and ladies and

01:29:32.639 --> 01:29:36.159
Caption: gents and everyone in this room

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:41.040
Caption: so the reason why we need you

01:29:38.799 --> 01:29:42.638
Caption: we need to make sure that we&#39;re design

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.120
Caption: what we&#39;re designing is not only

01:29:42.639 --> 01:29:48.560
Caption: desirable but it&#39;s also feasible to

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:50.719
Caption: create and viable for the business

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:53.120
Caption: so if there&#39;s no collaboration there we

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:55.679
Caption: end up missing two key areas our

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:57.840
Caption: feasibility and our viability

01:29:55.679 --> 01:29:59.840
Caption: so innovation and great products can&#39;t

01:29:57.839 --> 01:30:01.599
Caption: happen in isolation

01:29:59.839 --> 01:30:03.520
Caption: and it&#39;s certainly not about throwing

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.879
Caption: things over the fence and designing and

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.399
Caption: developing

01:30:04.879 --> 01:30:08.879
Caption: without collaboration

01:30:06.399 --> 01:30:11.839
Caption: so collaboration is key to creating

01:30:08.879 --> 01:30:13.600
Caption: innovative products and services

01:30:11.839 --> 01:30:16.638
Caption: so for those that are interested this is

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:18.959
Caption: what we call a dvf framework

01:30:16.639 --> 01:30:21.040
Caption: it also is referred to as three lenses

01:30:18.959 --> 01:30:23.359
Caption: of innovation and it was done by

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:25.040
Caption: originally a company called ideo

01:30:23.359 --> 01:30:27.040
Caption: and there&#39;s been a lot of talk recently

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:29.120
Caption: about a fourth lens uh this is for

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:30.879
Caption: sustainability and this is where we&#39;re

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.800
Caption: looking at including social and

01:30:30.879 --> 01:30:35.520
Caption: environmental awarenesses into our

01:30:32.799 --> 01:30:38.319
Caption: designs as well

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:39.600
Caption: right let&#39;s go through some practical

01:30:38.319 --> 01:30:40.479
Caption: tips because i&#39;m all about practical

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:42.719
Caption: tips

01:30:40.479 --> 01:30:45.199
Caption: that can help improve collaboration with

01:30:42.719 --> 01:30:48.239
Caption: your designers

01:30:45.199 --> 01:30:51.040
Caption: so first see your design team as your

01:30:48.238 --> 01:30:53.439
Caption: true partner in crime so we can help you

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:55.600
Caption: understand customer needs and can help

01:30:53.439 --> 01:30:58.159
Caption: you influence the product design and

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:58.159
Caption: direction

01:30:58.639 --> 01:31:04.400
Caption: and provide constructive feedback so we

01:31:01.279 --> 01:31:06.559
Caption: love getting good useful um feedback and

01:31:04.399 --> 01:31:08.879
Caption: fresh ideas but it needs to be delivered

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:10.959
Caption: in a way which is actually useful so

01:31:08.879 --> 01:31:13.359
Caption: things like i love it is always great

01:31:10.959 --> 01:31:15.520
Caption: but making sure you tell us why you love

01:31:13.359 --> 01:31:16.799
Caption: it the same thing goes with uh i don&#39;t

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:18.479
Caption: like it

01:31:16.799 --> 01:31:20.799
Caption: make sure that you&#39;ve got that backing

01:31:18.479 --> 01:31:22.799
Caption: there for why you don&#39;t like it

01:31:20.799 --> 01:31:25.359
Caption: so providing a reason will always help

01:31:22.799 --> 01:31:28.079
Caption: your designers but you need to make sure

01:31:25.359 --> 01:31:30.000
Caption: it&#39;s with the lens of your customer

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:32.000
Caption: make sure it&#39;s objective feedback and if

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.879
Caption: you&#39;ve got the data there to support it

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.879
Caption: even better

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:40.080
Caption: so be upfront about constraints

01:31:37.759 --> 01:31:42.079
Caption: so your designers should be getting the

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.719
Caption: feedback from you throughout the design

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:47.359
Caption: process and if they&#39;re not definitely

01:31:44.719 --> 01:31:49.600
Caption: hit them up about that

01:31:47.359 --> 01:31:51.600
Caption: speak up about technical and business

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.879
Caption: constraints as well so when we know

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.800
Caption: about these

01:31:52.879 --> 01:31:57.040
Caption: it helps us work with you to find an

01:31:54.799 --> 01:31:59.119
Caption: alternative solution

01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:00.959
Caption: but it&#39;s really important to be

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:03.360
Caption: considerate and to make sure that

01:32:00.959 --> 01:32:06.399
Caption: upfront constraints don&#39;t stifle

01:32:03.359 --> 01:32:08.799
Caption: creativity and innovation so make sure

01:32:06.399 --> 01:32:12.759
Caption: you work with your designers as a team

01:32:08.799 --> 01:32:12.759
Caption: to overcome those constraints

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:20.000
Caption: review design work thoroughly so this is

01:32:16.479 --> 01:32:22.560
Caption: especially true for our visual designers

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Caption: so details matter here right you they

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:25.919
Caption: may your designers may think that

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.839
Caption: they&#39;ve specked out everything but more

01:32:25.919 --> 01:32:29.040
Caption: than likely they have actually missed

01:32:27.839 --> 01:32:30.959
Caption: something

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:33.600
Caption: so the same thing goes for those that

01:32:30.959 --> 01:32:35.919
Caption: are working with design systems

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:37.679
Caption: so make sure you&#39;re factoring it in time

01:32:35.919 --> 01:32:39.439
Caption: with your feedback

01:32:37.679 --> 01:32:41.280
Caption: quite often we work hand to mouth

01:32:39.439 --> 01:32:42.879
Caption: especially when we&#39;re working in squads

01:32:41.279 --> 01:32:44.399
Caption: right where all the deliverables are

01:32:42.879 --> 01:32:46.080
Caption: really urgent

01:32:44.399 --> 01:32:48.080
Caption: but this actually leads to problems

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:49.839
Caption: later on so when suddenly it just

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:52.479
Caption: becomes a just get it done sort of

01:32:49.839 --> 01:32:55.839
Caption: scenario we may miss opportunities for

01:32:52.479 --> 01:32:55.839
Caption: things that need to be tested

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:59.520
Caption: now out of all of these points if

01:32:57.839 --> 01:33:01.839
Caption: there&#39;s any one point that&#39;s probably

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:03.919
Caption: the most important this is it this is

01:33:01.839 --> 01:33:06.560
Caption: about getting involved

01:33:03.919 --> 01:33:08.799
Caption: so observe your research sessions make

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:11.359
Caption: the time to observe them listen to the

01:33:08.799 --> 01:33:13.040
Caption: customer feedback and even your debriefs

01:33:11.359 --> 01:33:15.040
Caption: from your designers

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:16.000
Caption: so discuss with them what are their next

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:18.080
Caption: steps

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.238
Caption: highlight any technical or business

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:23.839
Caption: constraints and but leave it with them

01:33:20.238 --> 01:33:23.839
Caption: to make the design decisions

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.238
Caption: right so i actually know i&#39;ve got a few

01:33:26.238 --> 01:33:29.678
Caption: designers in the audience today so i

01:33:28.238 --> 01:33:31.359
Caption: don&#39;t think i haven&#39;t forgotten about

01:33:29.679 --> 01:33:32.719
Caption: you

01:33:31.359 --> 01:33:34.479
Caption: and hopefully some are watching online

01:33:32.719 --> 01:33:35.440
Caption: as well

01:33:34.479 --> 01:33:37.199
Caption: now

01:33:35.439 --> 01:33:38.879
Caption: just think

01:33:37.199 --> 01:33:40.719
Caption: what if you gave the same care and

01:33:38.879 --> 01:33:43.839
Caption: attention to the people that you work

01:33:40.719 --> 01:33:45.760
Caption: with as you do your end users right so

01:33:43.839 --> 01:33:47.678
Caption: find out the pain points and needs for

01:33:45.759 --> 01:33:49.678
Caption: the people that you work with

01:33:47.679 --> 01:33:52.639
Caption: so talk to them take them out for coffee

01:33:49.679 --> 01:33:54.159
Caption: maybe beer or wine always open for that

01:33:52.639 --> 01:33:56.000
Caption: maybe some people like something a

01:33:54.159 --> 01:33:58.000
Caption: little bit more formal

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.679
Caption: i&#39;ve even seen designers use empathy

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.199
Caption: maps before to better understand their

01:33:59.679 --> 01:34:03.360
Caption: teammates

01:34:01.199 --> 01:34:05.600
Caption: so understand maybe the pressures that

01:34:03.359 --> 01:34:07.439
Caption: your product owner is under so what

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:09.359
Caption: metrics are important to them what are

01:34:07.439 --> 01:34:10.879
Caption: they trying to achieve

01:34:09.359 --> 01:34:13.520
Caption: what are the pain points for your

01:34:10.879 --> 01:34:15.120
Caption: developers is rework a problem for them

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:16.319
Caption: what&#39;s going to make their life a lot

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.080
Caption: easier

01:34:16.319 --> 01:34:19.279
Caption: so by understanding the people that you

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:21.359
Caption: work with

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:23.839
Caption: just as well as you do your users you

01:34:21.359 --> 01:34:26.158
Caption: can actually establish better workflows

01:34:23.839 --> 01:34:27.919
Caption: that will provide better outcomes and

01:34:26.159 --> 01:34:30.639
Caption: will end up having a better happier

01:34:27.919 --> 01:34:32.799
Caption: working relationships

01:34:30.639 --> 01:34:36.239
Caption: so be like bruce lee this is very zen be

01:34:32.799 --> 01:34:38.559
Caption: like bruce lee be flexible like water

01:34:36.238 --> 01:34:40.879
Caption: so your design documentations and

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:43.600
Caption: workflows will change from project to

01:34:40.879 --> 01:34:46.238
Caption: project from team to team and you need

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.199
Caption: to adapt to what works best for your

01:34:46.238 --> 01:34:50.000
Caption: team

01:34:47.199 --> 01:34:51.360
Caption: so your team shouldn&#39;t adapt to you i

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.359
Caption: mean sure sometimes you may have

01:34:51.359 --> 01:34:55.439
Caption: suggestions to actually uh how a

01:34:53.359 --> 01:34:57.839
Caption: different approach may help everything

01:34:55.439 --> 01:35:02.479
Caption: but in general we&#39;re a piece of a larger

01:34:57.839 --> 01:35:02.479
Caption: puzzle so be like water be adaptable

01:35:02.959 --> 01:35:07.120
Caption: your design will never be done sounds a

01:35:04.959 --> 01:35:08.560
Caption: little bit depressing but this is where

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:10.320
Caption: you need to be strong this is where

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:13.439
Caption: resilience is key

01:35:10.319 --> 01:35:15.759
Caption: so as a designer our job isn&#39;t done once

01:35:13.439 --> 01:35:17.120
Caption: our screens and prototypes are done

01:35:15.759 --> 01:35:18.718
Caption: you&#39;re going to find that the real

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:20.639
Caption: challenge and i&#39;m finding this at the

01:35:18.719 --> 01:35:23.040
Caption: moment is when people start poking

01:35:20.639 --> 01:35:25.040
Caption: around in your designs discovering holes

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:26.239
Caption: and use cases that you haven&#39;t even

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:29.040
Caption: thought of

01:35:26.238 --> 01:35:31.279
Caption: and so as this happens you need to make

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:33.520
Caption: sure that you work harder to accommodate

01:35:31.279 --> 01:35:34.959
Caption: these requirements iterating on your

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:37.279
Caption: designs

01:35:34.959 --> 01:35:39.839
Caption: so our role this is because our role as

01:35:37.279 --> 01:35:42.559
Caption: designers is to create experiences that

01:35:39.839 --> 01:35:45.198
Caption: people actually use it&#39;s not about

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:47.199
Caption: creating mock-ups or concepts

01:35:45.199 --> 01:35:49.760
Caption: so we need to be responsible for the

01:35:47.199 --> 01:35:51.920
Caption: things we create we&#39;re an important part

01:35:49.759 --> 01:35:54.799
Caption: of what is produced and used by the

01:35:51.919 --> 01:35:55.919
Caption: people that we champion

01:35:54.799 --> 01:35:58.638
Caption: because of this we&#39;re going to

01:35:55.919 --> 01:36:00.879
Caption: continually keep iterating and improving

01:35:58.639 --> 01:36:03.199
Caption: and evolving our designs and they&#39;ll

01:36:00.879 --> 01:36:06.238
Caption: never be done but at the end of the day

01:36:03.199 --> 01:36:06.239
Caption: that&#39;s a great thing

01:36:07.359 --> 01:36:12.799
Caption: so it&#39;s not just about design either so

01:36:10.479 --> 01:36:15.359
Caption: how can designers help make sure that we

01:36:12.799 --> 01:36:17.279
Caption: deliver on a great product so this is

01:36:15.359 --> 01:36:19.119
Caption: where we&#39;re going to get our hands dirty

01:36:17.279 --> 01:36:21.039
Caption: and we&#39;re going to help provide feedback

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:23.679
Caption: on what&#39;s being built

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:25.600
Caption: so for example the designers in our web

01:36:23.679 --> 01:36:27.760
Caption: squad at the moment over at hbs have

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:29.199
Caption: been doing device testing and i&#39;ve had a

01:36:27.759 --> 01:36:30.559
Caption: heap of people come up to me going but

01:36:29.199 --> 01:36:32.000
Caption: why are you guys doing testing like

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:33.439
Caption: doesn&#39;t that sit with the developers and

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.359
Caption: the testers

01:36:33.439 --> 01:36:38.238
Caption: um but designers actually have an

01:36:35.359 --> 01:36:40.560
Caption: intimate knowledge of the product of the

01:36:38.238 --> 01:36:42.319
Caption: end user and what should be built right

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.679
Caption: and they know how those dots connect

01:36:42.319 --> 01:36:47.279
Caption: throughout that whole end to end

01:36:43.679 --> 01:36:49.040
Caption: experience so use that to your advantage

01:36:47.279 --> 01:36:51.039
Caption: so designers this means you might have

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:52.479
Caption: to get intimate with things like for

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:54.479
Caption: example jira

01:36:52.479 --> 01:36:56.799
Caption: make sure the acceptance criteria is

01:36:54.479 --> 01:36:58.560
Caption: correct make sure that that link in that

01:36:56.799 --> 01:37:00.399
Caption: ticket is linking through to your figma

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:02.639
Caption: file or your sketch file

01:37:00.399 --> 01:37:05.119
Caption: make sure those screenshots are correct

01:37:02.639 --> 01:37:06.959
Caption: so all of these things work to help your

01:37:05.119 --> 01:37:08.880
Caption: team and also help make sure that you

01:37:06.959 --> 01:37:11.600
Caption: deliver on a great product and

01:37:08.879 --> 01:37:11.600
Caption: experience

01:37:11.839 --> 01:37:17.198
Caption: so less is more

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:19.040
Caption: so as we desire as designers we design

01:37:17.199 --> 01:37:21.600
Caption: for an ideal state

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:24.159
Caption: right our future state so in the real

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:26.879
Caption: world not all of our features will make

01:37:24.159 --> 01:37:28.800
Caption: it into our mvp a minimal viable product

01:37:26.879 --> 01:37:31.040
Caption: that&#39;s built at the end

01:37:28.799 --> 01:37:33.359
Caption: so as the project progresses you&#39;re

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:36.159
Caption: going to find that your product owner is

01:37:33.359 --> 01:37:38.319
Caption: going to prioritize features and as this

01:37:36.159 --> 01:37:41.360
Caption: happens designers are going to see their

01:37:38.319 --> 01:37:42.959
Caption: work shrink and shrink and shrink and

01:37:41.359 --> 01:37:44.399
Caption: shrink until everything&#39;s sort of thrown

01:37:42.959 --> 01:37:45.600
Caption: out of it at the end of the day at the

01:37:44.399 --> 01:37:48.399
Caption: end of the boat

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:50.639
Caption: so this is where a design mindset change

01:37:48.399 --> 01:37:53.359
Caption: is needed so this should be seen as an

01:37:50.639 --> 01:37:55.679
Caption: opportunity rather than an attack

01:37:53.359 --> 01:37:58.319
Caption: so we can really work to refine out

01:37:55.679 --> 01:38:00.080
Caption: these mvp features and really make sure

01:37:58.319 --> 01:38:03.839
Caption: that we&#39;re working closely with our

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.839
Caption: teams to build this out

01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:09.678
Caption: now just like the last a lot of

01:38:07.919 --> 01:38:11.520
Caption: points that i went through if there&#39;s

01:38:09.679 --> 01:38:13.199
Caption: any one that you want to take away with

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:17.439
Caption: you this is probably it&#39;s about bringing

01:38:13.199 --> 01:38:20.719
Caption: our teams along for the ride

01:38:17.439 --> 01:38:22.879
Caption: and see there&#39;s a roller coaster there

01:38:20.719 --> 01:38:24.960
Caption: so sometimes our teams aren&#39;t involved

01:38:22.879 --> 01:38:26.399
Caption: in our discovery process

01:38:24.959 --> 01:38:28.718
Caption: sometimes they don&#39;t get to see things

01:38:26.399 --> 01:38:30.718
Caption: like usability tests or hear from our

01:38:28.719 --> 01:38:33.199
Caption: end users right

01:38:30.719 --> 01:38:35.440
Caption: so as designers we represent the voice

01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:37.280
Caption: of the customer we&#39;ve got a really

01:38:35.439 --> 01:38:40.000
Caption: important part in making sure that

01:38:37.279 --> 01:38:42.638
Caption: goodness spreads across our teams

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.479
Caption: so it might be things like playing back

01:38:42.639 --> 01:38:46.560
Caption: verbatim feedback that we&#39;ve had in our

01:38:44.479 --> 01:38:48.718
Caption: user testing sessions

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.800
Caption: we may present test results back in some

01:38:48.719 --> 01:38:53.520
Caption: things like uh we&#39;ve got showcases for

01:38:50.799 --> 01:38:54.959
Caption: example at hbf we play back our research

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:57.359
Caption: findings and those

01:38:54.959 --> 01:38:58.560
Caption: and if you&#39;re able to play back videos

01:38:57.359 --> 01:39:01.118
Caption: where people can hear it from the

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:03.199
Caption: horse&#39;s mouth that&#39;s even better

01:39:01.119 --> 01:39:05.760
Caption: so when you can make sure you involve

01:39:03.199 --> 01:39:08.320
Caption: your teams so it&#39;s really difficult

01:39:05.759 --> 01:39:10.959
Caption: sometimes because there is a tension

01:39:08.319 --> 01:39:12.718
Caption: between just getting the stuff done

01:39:10.959 --> 01:39:14.479
Caption: making sure we&#39;re achieving our sprint

01:39:12.719 --> 01:39:16.639
Caption: goals making sure we&#39;re getting that

01:39:14.479 --> 01:39:18.718
Caption: burn down looking really good

01:39:16.639 --> 01:39:21.040
Caption: but in the bigger picture we&#39;re going to

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:23.280
Caption: have products that provide a better

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:25.199
Caption: experiences for our teams if they know

01:39:23.279 --> 01:39:27.439
Caption: who they&#39;re designing them for and who

01:39:25.199 --> 01:39:30.159
Caption: they&#39;re building them for as well

01:39:27.439 --> 01:39:32.080
Caption: so as designers it&#39;s not just about us

01:39:30.159 --> 01:39:33.920
Caption: understanding our end users it&#39;s also

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:36.479
Caption: the role of the business to understand

01:39:33.919 --> 01:39:38.479
Caption: the end users and as designers we need

01:39:36.479 --> 01:39:39.759
Caption: to make sure we&#39;re better at spreading

01:39:38.479 --> 01:39:43.119
Caption: and sharing that knowledge and

01:39:39.759 --> 01:39:43.118
Caption: understanding of our customers

01:39:44.719 --> 01:39:48.400
Caption: so these tactics that i&#39;ve talked

01:39:46.719 --> 01:39:50.560
Caption: through are really aimed at improving

01:39:48.399 --> 01:39:52.080
Caption: collaboration right so we know that

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:54.719
Caption: collaboration is really key for

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:56.639
Caption: high-performing cross-functional teams

01:39:54.719 --> 01:39:58.400
Caption: but it also improves something that we

01:39:56.639 --> 01:40:02.479
Caption: call design maturity

01:39:58.399 --> 01:40:02.479
Caption: so what is design maturity

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:07.760
Caption: so design maturity is the way to which

01:40:05.439 --> 01:40:10.799
Caption: business businesses incorporate

01:40:07.759 --> 01:40:13.678
Caption: understand and use design

01:40:10.799 --> 01:40:16.158
Caption: so the more mature an organization the

01:40:13.679 --> 01:40:18.239
Caption: more likely that innovation better

01:40:16.159 --> 01:40:20.639
Caption: customer experiences and business

01:40:18.238 --> 01:40:22.479
Caption: benefits will happen

01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:24.080
Caption: so there&#39;s been a bunch of reports and

01:40:22.479 --> 01:40:25.759
Caption: models that have been done on design

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:27.919
Caption: maturity there&#39;s been one through the

01:40:25.759 --> 01:40:30.319
Caption: nielsen norman group that&#39;s very ux

01:40:27.919 --> 01:40:32.238
Caption: focused there was one three years ago

01:40:30.319 --> 01:40:34.399
Caption: through a company called envision and

01:40:32.238 --> 01:40:35.759
Caption: one done about five years ago through

01:40:34.399 --> 01:40:37.119
Caption: mckinsey

01:40:35.759 --> 01:40:41.118
Caption: so we&#39;re going to have a quick look at

01:40:37.119 --> 01:40:41.119
Caption: the envision maturity scale here

01:40:41.679 --> 01:40:46.880
Caption: so this is the maturity scale that was

01:40:43.759 --> 01:40:48.718
Caption: done by envision so here you can see as

01:40:46.879 --> 01:40:50.479
Caption: we move through different levels of

01:40:48.719 --> 01:40:52.560
Caption: design maturity so they&#39;re those big

01:40:50.479 --> 01:40:54.399
Caption: dots you see on the screen there

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:56.319
Caption: the benefits of design

01:40:54.399 --> 01:40:58.158
Caption: and the adoption of design in the

01:40:56.319 --> 01:40:59.919
Caption: business increase

01:40:58.159 --> 01:41:01.920
Caption: so these circles represent the

01:40:59.919 --> 01:41:04.560
Caption: proportions of businesses for each of

01:41:01.919 --> 01:41:06.879
Caption: these maturity stages in the study

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:09.119
Caption: so for example that little dot that you

01:41:06.879 --> 01:41:11.118
Caption: see at the top right there

01:41:09.119 --> 01:41:12.880
Caption: that shows that five percent of com

01:41:11.119 --> 01:41:14.800
Caption: companies were at the top level of

01:41:12.879 --> 01:41:19.560
Caption: design maturity so in this study that&#39;s

01:41:14.799 --> 01:41:19.559
Caption: 110 businesses out of 2200

01:41:20.238 --> 01:41:24.399
Caption: so let&#39;s look at each of these levels

01:41:22.319 --> 01:41:26.479
Caption: let&#39;s go into level ones

01:41:24.399 --> 01:41:28.238
Caption: so these have the lowest level of design

01:41:26.479 --> 01:41:31.520
Caption: maturity but they actually make up the

01:41:28.238 --> 01:41:33.118
Caption: largest proportion at 41

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:36.159
Caption: so these are the companies where design

01:41:33.119 --> 01:41:37.919
Caption: is just seen as pixels on a screen

01:41:36.159 --> 01:41:40.479
Caption: so here there&#39;s a real disconnect

01:41:37.919 --> 01:41:43.040
Caption: between what designers design and what

01:41:40.479 --> 01:41:47.399
Caption: developers actually produce and so this

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:47.399
Caption: is a symptom of a lack of collaboration

01:41:47.439 --> 01:41:52.799
Caption: when we hit our level two so this is a

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:54.320
Caption: level two throughout 21 here this is

01:41:52.799 --> 01:41:56.319
Caption: where collaboration with these

01:41:54.319 --> 01:41:58.238
Caption: organizations was improving where

01:41:56.319 --> 01:42:00.399
Caption: designers and non-designers are starting

01:41:58.238 --> 01:42:02.879
Caption: to work together a lot more

01:42:00.399 --> 01:42:05.919
Caption: so here you&#39;re seeing more things like

01:42:02.879 --> 01:42:07.520
Caption: integrated tooling user research user

01:42:05.919 --> 01:42:10.000
Caption: testing you&#39;re probably seeing some

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:11.600
Caption: personas around the business

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:15.839
Caption: and you&#39;re generally hearing a lot more

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:15.840
Caption: chit chat about design in the business

01:42:16.479 --> 01:42:19.040
Caption: now

01:42:17.439 --> 01:42:20.959
Caption: we&#39;re going to look at our level threes

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:23.280
Caption: here they&#39;re at 21

01:42:20.959 --> 01:42:25.040
Caption: as well but this is where design starts

01:42:23.279 --> 01:42:27.439
Caption: to become scalable where there&#39;s

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:29.760
Caption: established things like processes roles

01:42:27.439 --> 01:42:31.759
Caption: responsibilities documentation all of

01:42:29.759 --> 01:42:34.079
Caption: that sort of stuff so this is where

01:42:31.759 --> 01:42:36.959
Caption: design operates in more complex

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:39.280
Caption: companies and product ecosystems

01:42:36.959 --> 01:42:41.759
Caption: so with level threes you&#39;re seeing more

01:42:39.279 --> 01:42:46.718
Caption: things like design systems written

01:42:41.759 --> 01:42:46.718
Caption: briefs um and more design ceremonies

01:42:47.359 --> 01:42:50.319
Caption: when we look at our level fours so this

01:42:49.119 --> 01:42:52.080
Caption: is where we&#39;re starting to get a little

01:42:50.319 --> 01:42:54.079
Caption: bit smaller here this is uh twelve

01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:55.600
Caption: percent of companies in this survey that

01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:56.719
Caption: um envisioned in

01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:59.199
Caption: so this is where you&#39;re starting to see

01:42:56.719 --> 01:43:02.080
Caption: a lot more design experimentation and

01:42:59.199 --> 01:43:03.360
Caption: it&#39;s all about data driven design

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:05.600
Caption: so this is where you&#39;re probably

01:43:03.359 --> 01:43:07.600
Caption: starting to see the start of a design

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:09.119
Caption: strategy practice this is where you&#39;re

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:11.679
Caption: probably going to see more market

01:43:09.119 --> 01:43:13.360
Caption: research and design vision development

01:43:11.679 --> 01:43:15.040
Caption: have happening and you&#39;re probably

01:43:13.359 --> 01:43:16.638
Caption: seeing design operations being

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:18.879
Caption: formalized to support the design

01:43:16.639 --> 01:43:20.639
Caption: practice as well

01:43:18.879 --> 01:43:22.959
Caption: and our last little dot at the top there

01:43:20.639 --> 01:43:24.719
Caption: that&#39;s our level five so this is nirvana

01:43:22.959 --> 01:43:27.359
Caption: right so this is level five it sounded

01:43:24.719 --> 01:43:29.840
Caption: really australian banana anyway

01:43:27.359 --> 01:43:31.678
Caption: um this is our ultimate level of design

01:43:29.839 --> 01:43:33.839
Caption: maturity right this is only where five

01:43:31.679 --> 01:43:36.159
Caption: percent of the companies in the survey

01:43:33.839 --> 01:43:38.319
Caption: we&#39;re playing so this is where design is

01:43:36.159 --> 01:43:40.159
Caption: actually used to help business strategy

01:43:38.319 --> 01:43:42.319
Caption: where we&#39;re doing exploratory user

01:43:40.159 --> 01:43:44.719
Caption: research we&#39;re doing trend spotting and

01:43:42.319 --> 01:43:47.118
Caption: futures research we&#39;re experimenting

01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:51.040
Caption: we&#39;re testing for product market fit and

01:43:47.119 --> 01:43:51.040
Caption: producing things like vision artifacts

01:43:51.439 --> 01:43:54.799
Caption: so the majority of places that i&#39;ve

01:43:53.119 --> 01:43:56.800
Caption: worked at i&#39;d say would be between a

01:43:54.799 --> 01:43:59.118
Caption: level one and three so that&#39;s not a bad

01:43:56.799 --> 01:44:01.439
Caption: thing it just means design is a function

01:43:59.119 --> 01:44:02.800
Caption: in the business is in its early days

01:44:01.439 --> 01:44:04.479
Caption: and so it&#39;s really important to remember

01:44:02.799 --> 01:44:07.839
Caption: you can&#39;t just jump from a level one to

01:44:04.479 --> 01:44:10.080
Caption: a level five if only if it was that easy

01:44:07.839 --> 01:44:11.759
Caption: it&#39;s a real gradual progression that he

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:14.080
Caption: requires a huge amount of effort and a

01:44:11.759 --> 01:44:16.718
Caption: lot of the the business uh buying from

01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:19.199
Caption: uh the business as well

01:44:16.719 --> 01:44:20.880
Caption: so it can take years to move from one

01:44:19.199 --> 01:44:23.040
Caption: stage to the next

01:44:20.879 --> 01:44:25.759
Caption: but it happens every day and still in

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:27.439
Caption: small steps i do seem to remember off

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:29.678
Caption: the top of my head but don&#39;t quote me i

01:44:27.439 --> 01:44:34.238
Caption: think it takes probably about 30 years

01:44:29.679 --> 01:44:36.959
Caption: possibly to reach a level 5 organization

01:44:34.238 --> 01:44:39.118
Caption: so aside from collaboration what can

01:44:36.959 --> 01:44:40.718
Caption: help right so here are some tips from

01:44:39.119 --> 01:44:42.320
Caption: that report

01:44:40.719 --> 01:44:45.600
Caption: and some examples of what we&#39;ve been

01:44:42.319 --> 01:44:45.599
Caption: doing over at hbf

01:44:46.159 --> 01:44:50.479
Caption: so design needs to be supported at a

01:44:48.238 --> 01:44:52.479
Caption: leadership level so when it&#39;s seen as

01:44:50.479 --> 01:44:54.159
Caption: more than just pixels on a screen and

01:44:52.479 --> 01:44:56.159
Caption: it&#39;s recognized as a part of the

01:44:54.159 --> 01:44:58.400
Caption: business a critical part of the business

01:44:56.159 --> 01:44:59.679
Caption: there&#39;s opportunity to use design to

01:44:58.399 --> 01:45:02.158
Caption: innovate

01:44:59.679 --> 01:45:03.679
Caption: so it&#39;s something that we do have at hbf

01:45:02.159 --> 01:45:05.199
Caption: so we&#39;ve got support from our general

01:45:03.679 --> 01:45:07.440
Caption: managers in the business and we&#39;ve got

01:45:05.199 --> 01:45:08.719
Caption: an executive general manager of member

01:45:07.439 --> 01:45:11.040
Caption: experience

01:45:08.719 --> 01:45:13.600
Caption: so they actually understand and speak to

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:15.679
Caption: the value of design and so having this

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:18.080
Caption: support actually means that hpf has

01:45:15.679 --> 01:45:19.920
Caption: actually adopted design and see it as

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:23.040
Caption: key for improving the customer and

01:45:19.919 --> 01:45:23.040
Caption: member experiences

01:45:23.679 --> 01:45:27.440
Caption: so higher experience design leaders

01:45:26.238 --> 01:45:29.439
Caption: right isn&#39;t this typically what you

01:45:27.439 --> 01:45:32.959
Caption: think of a designer you know wearing

01:45:29.439 --> 01:45:35.279
Caption: black glasses and a black outfit

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:37.198
Caption: the more senior a design leadership the

01:45:35.279 --> 01:45:40.000
Caption: greater the return on the design

01:45:37.199 --> 01:45:42.239
Caption: investment so who should you be hiring

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.319
Caption: for right so you need design leaders

01:45:42.238 --> 01:45:46.638
Caption: that know their craft they can inspire

01:45:44.319 --> 01:45:49.678
Caption: their team and they can make a strong

01:45:46.639 --> 01:45:51.119
Caption: case for design at the highest levels of

01:45:49.679 --> 01:45:53.440
Caption: business

01:45:51.119 --> 01:45:55.439
Caption: so at hbf we&#39;ve got a chat to lead and

01:45:53.439 --> 01:45:57.119
Caption: we&#39;ve also got a gm of member experience

01:45:55.439 --> 01:45:59.040
Caption: strategy and they&#39;re part of those

01:45:57.119 --> 01:46:01.360
Caption: critical conversations and this actually

01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:02.639
Caption: gives design a voice in the business

01:46:01.359 --> 01:46:05.919
Caption: where it can actually be used to

01:46:02.639 --> 01:46:05.919
Caption: transform the business

01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:10.080
Caption: and use design to run regular

01:46:07.919 --> 01:46:11.600
Caption: experiments and use data to inform

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:13.439
Caption: strategy so

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:16.320
Caption: companies can innovate when they use

01:46:13.439 --> 01:46:18.959
Caption: design and data to explore experiment

01:46:16.319 --> 01:46:20.638
Caption: inform and de-risk right so an example

01:46:18.959 --> 01:46:23.279
Caption: of where we&#39;ve used design experiments

01:46:20.639 --> 01:46:25.040
Caption: at hbf it was in our future state

01:46:23.279 --> 01:46:26.638
Caption: service design work

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:28.719
Caption: so this is where we were able to connect

01:46:26.639 --> 01:46:30.880
Caption: the dots between the design strategy and

01:46:28.719 --> 01:46:32.960
Caption: the business strategy where we were able

01:46:30.879 --> 01:46:35.439
Caption: to prove that we could get efficiency

01:46:32.959 --> 01:46:38.799
Caption: gains and cost savings right so for

01:46:35.439 --> 01:46:40.799
Caption: example we were able to identify that 20

01:46:38.799 --> 01:46:42.238
Caption: of our online sales for hbf were

01:46:40.799 --> 01:46:43.599
Caption: actually members trying to change their

01:46:42.238 --> 01:46:45.919
Caption: level of cover

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:48.080
Caption: and so this informed our design strategy

01:46:45.919 --> 01:46:50.238
Caption: where we&#39;ve prototyped and experimented

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:51.839
Caption: with solutions for this

01:46:50.238 --> 01:46:54.319
Caption: and then we also identified that we

01:46:51.839 --> 01:46:56.158
Caption: could provide cost savings to hbf where

01:46:54.319 --> 01:46:58.399
Caption: we&#39;ve hypothesized that there will be

01:46:56.159 --> 01:47:01.040
Caption: decreases in manual handling costs and

01:46:58.399 --> 01:47:02.638
Caption: the number of calls into our cost center

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:06.399
Caption: and so moving forward we know that these

01:47:02.639 --> 01:47:06.400
Caption: are also metrics that we want to measure

01:47:06.719 --> 01:47:10.960
Caption: and spread design throughout the

01:47:08.399 --> 01:47:12.158
Caption: business so when design works at scale

01:47:10.959 --> 01:47:14.080
Caption: and it&#39;s embedded within the

01:47:12.159 --> 01:47:16.000
Caption: organization it&#39;s going to have more

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:18.239
Caption: impact and influence

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.919
Caption: so our design practice over at hbf is

01:47:18.238 --> 01:47:22.238
Caption: still pretty young and we&#39;re looking at

01:47:19.919 --> 01:47:24.080
Caption: still establishing things like processes

01:47:22.238 --> 01:47:26.319
Caption: and design standards and building out

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:28.879
Caption: things like our design system and these

01:47:26.319 --> 01:47:30.718
Caption: are going to help us work at scale and

01:47:28.879 --> 01:47:32.959
Caption: that&#39;s exactly what happens when you see

01:47:30.719 --> 01:47:34.560
Caption: design maturity trying to build in an

01:47:32.959 --> 01:47:36.718
Caption: organization

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:38.560
Caption: and so what we do start seeing we do

01:47:36.719 --> 01:47:40.719
Caption: have signs of design culture um

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:42.719
Caption: throughout hbf so we&#39;re seeing things

01:47:40.719 --> 01:47:45.119
Caption: like we&#39;ve got to design an experience

01:47:42.719 --> 01:47:46.320
Caption: chapter we&#39;ve got business capabilities

01:47:45.119 --> 01:47:48.239
Caption: that are actually aligned to our

01:47:46.319 --> 01:47:50.560
Caption: customer journey we&#39;ve got an

01:47:48.238 --> 01:47:52.638
Caption: established research program and we&#39;ve

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:54.800
Caption: got a guiding value proposition and

01:47:52.639 --> 01:47:56.800
Caption: design principles and these were

01:47:54.799 --> 01:47:59.279
Caption: actually created through things like

01:47:56.799 --> 01:48:01.359
Caption: research concept testing

01:47:59.279 --> 01:48:02.959
Caption: experts and employees that were

01:48:01.359 --> 01:48:05.839
Caption: interviewed and they&#39;re our north star

01:48:02.959 --> 01:48:05.839
Caption: for our design work

01:48:06.399 --> 01:48:09.839
Caption: so where to next

01:48:07.919 --> 01:48:12.799
Caption: so the design profession is still

01:48:09.839 --> 01:48:14.879
Caption: evolving so only in the last 10 years

01:48:12.799 --> 01:48:17.759
Caption: the last decade have we seen design as a

01:48:14.879 --> 01:48:20.799
Caption: way to actually drive business success

01:48:17.759 --> 01:48:22.559
Caption: and also to be used to solve for complex

01:48:20.799 --> 01:48:24.399
Caption: human issues

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:26.879
Caption: so we need to make sure we still don&#39;t

01:48:24.399 --> 01:48:28.638
Caption: lose our producers and our crafts people

01:48:26.879 --> 01:48:30.799
Caption: these are our design specialists that

01:48:28.639 --> 01:48:32.719
Caption: sit in those first two orders

01:48:30.799 --> 01:48:35.118
Caption: but we need to also have our strategists

01:48:32.719 --> 01:48:37.199
Caption: and our visionaries who work and thrive

01:48:35.119 --> 01:48:38.800
Caption: in complexity especially in that fourth

01:48:37.199 --> 01:48:41.199
Caption: order

01:48:38.799 --> 01:48:43.599
Caption: and as technology continues to grow and

01:48:41.199 --> 01:48:46.000
Caption: change so will design

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:48.080
Caption: so as a fun fact some people may have

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.359
Caption: spotted this uh the majority of the

01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:51.040
Caption: images that i&#39;ve used in this

01:48:49.359 --> 01:48:54.000
Caption: presentation were actually done through

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:56.399
Caption: mid-journey it&#39;s an ai image generator

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.399
Caption: so things like artificial intelligence

01:48:56.399 --> 01:48:59.919
Caption: virtual reality the metaverse and

01:48:58.399 --> 01:49:02.959
Caption: automation are going to have huge

01:48:59.919 --> 01:49:05.040
Caption: impacts on design in the future

01:49:02.959 --> 01:49:07.839
Caption: and so as we&#39;re facing into a more

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:10.239
Caption: complex world and as it starts to change

01:49:07.839 --> 01:49:12.479
Caption: faster than ever before designers are

01:49:10.238 --> 01:49:14.718
Caption: well placed to help for the us all for

01:49:12.479 --> 01:49:16.560
Caption: the big messy problem spaces that come

01:49:14.719 --> 01:49:19.880
Caption: with this

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:19.879
Caption: thank you

01:49:31.439 --> 01:49:34.399
Caption: we&#39;ve got like two minutes for questions

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.800
Caption: so

01:49:34.399 --> 01:49:39.799
Caption: getting quick all right i&#39;ll run over

01:49:36.799 --> 01:49:39.799
Caption: quickly

01:49:51.919 --> 01:49:56.000
Caption: awesome loved it question about the

01:49:54.238 --> 01:49:58.158
Caption: five-point maturity model we love a

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.639
Caption: five-point maturity model for change and

01:49:58.159 --> 01:50:03.280
Caption: agile and innovation in general does the

01:50:00.639 --> 01:50:04.560
Caption: design maturity model that you talk to

01:50:03.279 --> 01:50:06.718
Caption: that you guys

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:08.159
Caption: look at at hbf does it align with those

01:50:06.719 --> 01:50:11.320
Caption: other maturity models and do you think

01:50:08.159 --> 01:50:11.320
Caption: it should

01:50:17.359 --> 01:50:21.439
Caption: we actually haven&#39;t so we haven&#39;t

01:50:19.359 --> 01:50:24.479
Caption: actually set out a

01:50:21.439 --> 01:50:27.119
Caption: design maturity model over at hbf

01:50:24.479 --> 01:50:29.040
Caption: i do know that um over i&#39;m going to use

01:50:27.119 --> 01:50:32.000
Caption: a different reference actually so over

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:33.280
Caption: at asb bank in new zealand they did

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.600
Caption: actually use the envision design

01:50:33.279 --> 01:50:38.000
Caption: maturity index to measure their own

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.159
Caption: design maturity and they actually used

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.359
Caption: it as a um

01:50:40.159 --> 01:50:43.520
Caption: as a

01:50:41.359 --> 01:50:44.879
Caption: like at a business level to say by next

01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:46.479
Caption: year by the end of next financial year

01:50:44.879 --> 01:50:48.560
Caption: we want to go from a level two to a

01:50:46.479 --> 01:50:50.238
Caption: level three so that&#39;s where we have

01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:52.080
Caption: actually seen it used really well there

01:50:50.238 --> 01:50:54.799
Caption: are some different nuances as well so

01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:56.959
Caption: the mckinsey one uh was only focused i

01:50:54.799 --> 01:51:01.198
Caption: think it was on three different

01:50:56.959 --> 01:51:03.119
Caption: um areas um and had only about 300

01:51:01.199 --> 01:51:04.639
Caption: businesses that they actually

01:51:03.119 --> 01:51:07.280
Caption: surveyed in that one

01:51:04.639 --> 01:51:09.119
Caption: the envision one is over 2000 so it&#39;s

01:51:07.279 --> 01:51:11.520
Caption: 2200

01:51:09.119 --> 01:51:13.119
Caption: all over the world um all of like a

01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:15.520
Caption: range of different industries as well

01:51:13.119 --> 01:51:17.040
Caption: but the only the only other thing is

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:17.839
Caption: that they&#39;re also envisioned customers

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:19.280
Caption: so

01:51:17.839 --> 01:51:21.198
Caption: everything&#39;s a little bit different and

01:51:19.279 --> 01:51:23.759
Caption: then the nielsen normal one is also very

01:51:21.199 --> 01:51:26.880
Caption: ux focused and it&#39;s also very subjective

01:51:23.759 --> 01:51:28.799
Caption: as well so um like i&#39;ve we had a huge

01:51:26.879 --> 01:51:30.560
Caption: discussion a couple of weeks ago between

01:51:28.799 --> 01:51:32.079
Caption: some of the design leads and myself and

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:33.760
Caption: we were like oh we&#39;re at a level two but

01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:36.000
Caption: then there&#39;s other sections in the

01:51:33.759 --> 01:51:37.678
Caption: business like i design strategy practice

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.040
Caption: which will probably be at level four so

01:51:37.679 --> 01:51:41.199
Caption: it changes like you&#39;ve got different

01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:43.280
Caption: pockets in the organization so as a

01:51:41.199 --> 01:51:44.639
Caption: whole it becomes yeah quite quite

01:51:43.279 --> 01:51:46.079
Caption: difficult but

01:51:44.639 --> 01:51:48.080
Caption: i think as long as there&#39;s something

01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:49.760
Caption: there that you can actually go we think

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:52.080
Caption: we&#39;re roughly about this it still gives

01:51:49.759 --> 01:51:53.118
Caption: you some good steps moving forward so

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.359
Caption: yeah

01:51:53.119 --> 01:51:57.199
Caption: okay thank you

01:51:55.359 --> 01:51:59.520
Caption: thanks so much sorry we&#39;re slightly over

01:51:57.199 --> 01:52:02.080

Caption: we got a little problem

01:56:18.879 --> 01:56:22.479
Caption: as you know our motto is you need a

01:56:20.959 --> 01:56:23.839
Caption: professional bodyguard delivered to your

01:56:22.479 --> 01:56:26.159
Caption: door in less than half an hour you&#39;ve

01:56:23.839 --> 01:56:28.399
Caption: got it buddy but without an app ain&#39;t no

01:56:26.159 --> 01:56:31.119
Caption: bodyguard getting delivered nowhere so

01:56:28.399 --> 01:56:34.560
Caption: where are we with that uh the app is

01:56:31.119 --> 01:56:35.599
Caption: almost ready uh we just need

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:37.760
Caption: three

01:56:35.599 --> 01:56:39.599
Caption: more days we need it asap

01:56:37.759 --> 01:56:41.598
Caption: okay team what&#39;s the status on the app

01:56:39.599 --> 01:56:43.919
Caption: we&#39;re good to go except our login

01:56:41.599 --> 01:56:45.760
Caption: experience is a disaster

01:56:43.919 --> 01:56:47.678
Caption: we need something to keep our users data

01:56:45.759 --> 01:56:50.399
Caption: private

01:56:47.679 --> 01:56:52.239
Caption: and to keep the hackers out

01:56:50.399 --> 01:56:54.479
Caption: and it needs to work flawlessly because

01:56:52.238 --> 01:56:56.718
Caption: because i don&#39;t want to lose one single

02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:25.359
Caption: personal stories

02:04:22.639 --> 02:04:28.080
Caption: when i started joining the tech industry

02:04:25.359 --> 02:04:29.759
Caption: i felt quite overwhelmed

02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:31.199
Caption: when i just like my first day there was

02:04:29.759 --> 02:04:33.198
Caption: a lot of new things to learn there was

02:04:31.199 --> 02:04:35.599
Caption: new languages to learn a new code base

02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:37.040
Caption: to navigate all these new tools that i

02:04:35.599 --> 02:04:40.399
Caption: had to learn about

02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:42.639
Caption: and it was quite frankly a little bit

02:04:40.399 --> 02:04:44.158
Caption: much and especially also looking at my

02:04:42.639 --> 02:04:45.760
Caption: colleagues who all seemed to navigate

02:04:44.159 --> 02:04:47.520
Caption: this really really well

02:04:45.759 --> 02:04:49.839
Caption: more often than not i kind of felt like

02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:53.359
Caption: do i even belong in this industry

02:04:49.839 --> 02:04:55.839
Caption: maybe i shouldn&#39;t have done this

02:04:53.359 --> 02:04:57.759
Caption: so what i felt and i&#39;m still currently

02:04:55.839 --> 02:05:00.718
Caption: regularly experiencing is the textbook

02:04:57.759 --> 02:05:02.638
Caption: definition of imposter syndrome

02:05:00.719 --> 02:05:04.480
Caption: and imposter syndrome can be defined as

02:05:02.639 --> 02:05:06.639
Caption: feelings of self-doubt and personal

02:05:04.479 --> 02:05:11.119
Caption: incompetence that persists despite your

02:05:06.639 --> 02:05:11.119
Caption: education experience or accomplishments

02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:18.479
Caption: so you might wonder what does it feel

02:05:16.399 --> 02:05:21.520
Caption: like to have imposter feelings

02:05:18.479 --> 02:05:23.759

02:05:27.839 --> 02:05:31.359
Caption: tell that you have impossible feelings

02:05:31.759 --> 02:05:35.759
Caption: but jokes aside there are some common

02:05:33.599 --> 02:05:36.639
Caption: imposter thoughts that are likely to

02:05:35.759 --> 02:05:38.158
Caption: occur

02:05:36.639 --> 02:05:39.599
Caption: so let&#39;s have a look and see what goes

02:05:38.159 --> 02:05:41.599
Caption: on in the mind of people with impossible

02:05:39.599 --> 02:05:44.239
Caption: feelings

02:05:41.599 --> 02:05:48.599

Caption: and you&#39;re going to be found out

02:05:50.399 --> 02:05:53.198
Caption: sorry about that

02:05:54.238 --> 02:05:58.158
Caption: you might feel that you actually don&#39;t

02:05:55.679 --> 02:06:01.119
Caption: deserve your success and you may have

02:05:58.159 --> 02:06:01.119
Caption: just gotten lucky

02:06:01.199 --> 02:06:05.440

Caption: that special at all and you feel like if

02:06:05.439 --> 02:06:09.678
Caption: you can do it everybody else can do it

02:06:08.719 --> 02:06:11.760
Caption: or

02:06:09.679 --> 02:06:14.000
Caption: you may not be very good with praise and

02:06:11.759 --> 02:06:16.319

Caption: i had a lot of help

02:06:16.319 --> 02:06:20.718

Caption: just being nice to you

02:06:21.199 --> 02:06:24.719

02:06:23.199 --> 02:06:26.159
Caption: turns out to be

02:06:24.719 --> 02:06:28.320
Caption: very very common

02:06:26.159 --> 02:06:31.280
Caption: within the tech industry it&#39;s actually

02:06:28.319 --> 02:06:32.799
Caption: 58 of people who experience

02:06:31.279 --> 02:06:34.638
Caption: imposter feelings currently in their

02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:47.359

02:07:40.879 --> 02:07:44.000
Caption: projects that have been pushed where you

02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:46.000
Caption: like gave an estimate that it would take

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.319
Caption: four weeks six weeks and they would push

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:51.119
Caption: you to do it in four weeks

02:07:48.319 --> 02:07:51.118
Caption: but then there&#39;s also

02:07:52.079 --> 02:07:55.840
Caption: expectations that come from within so

02:07:54.238 --> 02:07:57.839
Caption: for instance if you&#39;re a new starter in

02:07:55.839 --> 02:07:59.439
Caption: the industry you may not really know

02:07:57.839 --> 02:08:01.279
Caption: what you need to do in order to perform

02:07:59.439 --> 02:08:03.520
Caption: in your industry

02:08:01.279 --> 02:08:05.919
Caption: or if you are more experienced something

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:09.359
Caption: like a promotion or new responsibilities

02:08:05.919 --> 02:08:11.839
Caption: can trigger impulsive feelings as well

02:08:09.359 --> 02:08:13.919
Caption: then there is also the fast pace that&#39;s

02:08:11.839 --> 02:08:15.279
Caption: happening in the tech industry things

02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:17.439
Caption: change a lot

02:08:15.279 --> 02:08:18.638
Caption: there&#39;s new languages all the time

02:08:17.439 --> 02:08:20.399
Caption: there&#39;s new

02:08:18.639 --> 02:08:22.719
Caption: concepts that you need to learn all the

02:08:20.399 --> 02:08:24.879
Caption: time you have to keep up otherwise you

02:08:22.719 --> 02:08:26.719
Caption: will be outdated

02:08:24.879 --> 02:08:28.479
Caption: and the same kind of works for companies

02:08:26.719 --> 02:08:30.079
Caption: in general you always have to try and do

02:08:28.479 --> 02:08:33.199
Caption: the new thing to make your customers

02:08:30.079 --> 02:08:35.359
Caption: happy otherwise they will go elsewhere

02:08:33.199 --> 02:08:36.880
Caption: and it also kind of happens to yourself

02:08:35.359 --> 02:08:38.718
Caption: you just want to keep up you want to do

02:08:36.879 --> 02:08:40.399
Caption: a good job as a new starter you might

02:08:38.719 --> 02:08:41.920
Caption: even want to like rush into things and

02:08:40.399 --> 02:08:43.439
Caption: make sure that you get up to speed as

02:08:41.919 --> 02:08:46.319
Caption: soon as possible

02:08:43.439 --> 02:08:49.718
Caption: and in the process you may end up being

02:08:46.319 --> 02:08:49.718
Caption: burned out

02:08:51.839 --> 02:08:55.198
Caption: um but we shouldn&#39;t talk about it right

02:08:53.839 --> 02:08:56.799
Caption: because it&#39;s kind of embarrassing to

02:08:55.199 --> 02:08:59.199
Caption: have these feelings and i&#39;m probably the

02:08:56.799 --> 02:09:02.238
Caption: only person who has it

02:08:59.199 --> 02:09:02.239
Caption: no splash you aren&#39;t

02:09:03.439 --> 02:09:09.040
Caption: and then there&#39;s also the uh part of

02:09:06.079 --> 02:09:09.040
Caption: like some of us

02:09:09.919 --> 02:09:14.959
Caption: this has literally happened to me today

02:09:11.599 --> 02:09:14.959
Caption: i haven&#39;t had a single line it was

02:09:15.238 --> 02:09:20.000
Caption: great um

02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:21.839
Caption: yeah so one of the other things that can

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.439
Caption: cause impulsive feelings as well is

02:09:21.839 --> 02:09:24.799
Caption: especially from people from

02:09:23.439 --> 02:09:26.000
Caption: underrepresented groups is that they

02:09:24.799 --> 02:09:28.559
Caption: don&#39;t really have these people that they

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.799
Caption: can look up to they miss um

02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:31.599
Caption: people with empathetic leadership skills

02:09:30.799 --> 02:09:33.439
Caption: or

02:09:31.599 --> 02:09:34.639
Caption: like just generally people who look like

02:09:33.439 --> 02:09:37.198
Caption: them who&#39;ve had success in their

02:09:34.639 --> 02:09:37.199
Caption: workplace

02:09:37.839 --> 02:09:41.279
Caption: and if things weren&#39;t already bad enough

02:09:39.679 --> 02:09:43.280
Caption: in the tech industry

02:09:41.279 --> 02:09:45.039
Caption: of course we also have been hit by this

02:09:43.279 --> 02:09:47.279
Caption: thing called covet

02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:49.119
Caption: and covert has kind of made us work in

02:09:47.279 --> 02:09:51.198
Caption: in different ways now we all have kind

02:09:49.119 --> 02:09:53.040
Caption: of a new role and we have to get ready

02:09:51.199 --> 02:09:54.960
Caption: like have to be ready to work from home

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:57.679
Caption: and some of you may have even been

02:09:54.959 --> 02:09:59.599
Caption: parenting as well while i&#39;m teaching

02:09:57.679 --> 02:10:01.520
Caption: while working from home

02:09:59.599 --> 02:10:02.800
Caption: so yeah lots have happened and lots of

02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:05.599
Caption: things that can actually trigger your

02:10:02.799 --> 02:10:07.598
Caption: impulsive feelings

02:10:05.599 --> 02:10:09.599
Caption: but despite what you&#39;re feeling

02:10:07.599 --> 02:10:12.239
Caption: is can be quite nerve-wracking it&#39;s

02:10:09.599 --> 02:10:14.000
Caption: actually pretty normal and having a

02:10:12.238 --> 02:10:15.839
Caption: little bit of self-doubt is actually

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:17.520
Caption: healthy because it will push you to do

02:10:15.839 --> 02:10:18.638
Caption: better things to become better to learn

02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:23.040
Caption: new things

02:10:18.639 --> 02:10:23.040
Caption: so you shouldn&#39;t feel bad about it

02:10:23.759 --> 02:10:28.959
Caption: the goal here is to not feel like an

02:10:26.238 --> 02:10:30.879
Caption: imposter ever again but to have the

02:10:28.959 --> 02:10:34.159
Caption: tools to talk yourself down faster when

02:10:30.879 --> 02:10:34.158
Caption: you have an imposter moment

02:10:34.879 --> 02:10:40.799
Caption: so let&#39;s go back to those expectations

02:10:37.199 --> 02:10:44.320
Caption: i&#39;m sure many of you have seen this one

02:10:40.799 --> 02:10:47.759
Caption: when i got promoted about six months ago

02:10:44.319 --> 02:10:49.919
Caption: i felt like i didn&#39;t deserve it at all i

02:10:47.759 --> 02:10:51.279
Caption: wasn&#39;t ready i still felt like i had so

02:10:49.919 --> 02:10:52.879
Caption: much to learn and there were so many

02:10:51.279 --> 02:10:55.520
Caption: other associates who were way more

02:10:52.879 --> 02:10:58.319
Caption: prepared for this than me

02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:59.919
Caption: so yeah my expectations of where i

02:10:58.319 --> 02:11:01.439
Caption: needed to be were

02:10:59.919 --> 02:11:03.439
Caption: where i thought i had to be versus where

02:11:01.439 --> 02:11:05.839
Caption: i actually had to be way out of whack

02:11:03.439 --> 02:11:07.759
Caption: because if i look at it rationally i had

02:11:05.839 --> 02:11:08.879
Caption: met all those requirements

02:11:07.759 --> 02:11:11.039
Caption: um

02:11:08.879 --> 02:11:15.678
Caption: yeah so

02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:15.679
Caption: well sorry kind of blanking here

02:11:22.399 --> 02:11:26.238
Caption: yeah so i focused so hard on the things

02:11:24.399 --> 02:11:28.879
Caption: that i didn&#39;t know that i kind of forget

02:11:26.238 --> 02:11:31.039
Caption: how far i actually have come so far

02:11:28.879 --> 02:11:32.799
Caption: um if you look at me a year and a half

02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:34.959
Caption: ago the only thing i was probably able

02:11:32.799 --> 02:11:37.198
Caption: to do was write a line of python that

02:11:34.959 --> 02:11:39.919
Caption: said hello world in a console

02:11:37.199 --> 02:11:42.800
Caption: and now i am working as a software

02:11:39.919 --> 02:11:44.319
Caption: engineer full-time at a company i am

02:11:42.799 --> 02:11:46.319
Caption: mentoring and guiding people who are new

02:11:44.319 --> 02:11:47.919
Caption: to the industry or new to the job and i

02:11:46.319 --> 02:11:49.598
Caption: am standing here presenting for all of

02:11:47.919 --> 02:11:53.238
Caption: you so that should probably count for

02:11:49.599 --> 02:11:53.239
Caption: something i guess

02:11:56.159 --> 02:11:59.280
Caption: you&#39;re making me shy

02:11:58.159 --> 02:12:00.959
Caption: um

02:11:59.279 --> 02:12:02.638
Caption: so yeah appreciate the progress that you

02:12:00.959 --> 02:12:04.399
Caption: have made so far

02:12:02.639 --> 02:12:05.199
Caption: but if you&#39;re really struggling to do

02:12:04.399 --> 02:12:07.119
Caption: that

02:12:05.199 --> 02:12:08.159
Caption: there&#39;s other ways that you can kind of

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:10.639
Caption: like

02:12:08.159 --> 02:12:12.239
Caption: uh focus on how far you&#39;ve come and

02:12:10.639 --> 02:12:14.479
Caption: that&#39;s mentoring others

02:12:12.238 --> 02:12:16.638
Caption: if you are able to teach a new concept

02:12:14.479 --> 02:12:18.238
Caption: to a person who&#39;s like just starting out

02:12:16.639 --> 02:12:20.400
Caption: that&#39;s a really good way to sort of

02:12:18.238 --> 02:12:22.238
Caption: gauge like oh i&#39;ve actually managed to

02:12:20.399 --> 02:12:23.599
Caption: learn this myself quite well and i&#39;m

02:12:22.238 --> 02:12:26.718
Caption: able to actually

02:12:23.599 --> 02:12:26.719
Caption: teach this to other people

02:12:27.439 --> 02:12:30.879
Caption: but if you are really really set on

02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:33.119
Caption: looking forward

02:12:30.879 --> 02:12:36.238
Caption: please remember that your career is a

02:12:33.119 --> 02:12:38.560
Caption: marathon and not a sprint

02:12:36.238 --> 02:12:41.198
Caption: if you take a nice steady pace like a

02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:43.119
Caption: marathon runner you can learn all these

02:12:41.199 --> 02:12:44.079
Caption: new skills and learn all this new

02:12:43.119 --> 02:12:45.280
Caption: knowledge

02:12:44.079 --> 02:12:47.359
Caption: while

02:12:45.279 --> 02:12:49.839
Caption: not really zooming past anything that&#39;s

02:12:47.359 --> 02:12:49.839
Caption: important

02:12:50.719 --> 02:12:54.320
Caption: and part of that is also to do with

02:12:52.319 --> 02:12:56.399
Caption: setting appropriate goals

02:12:54.319 --> 02:12:58.078
Caption: you want to be able to

02:12:56.399 --> 02:12:59.839
Caption: focus on the core skills developing

02:12:58.079 --> 02:13:01.439
Caption: growth skills and rather than focusing

02:12:59.839 --> 02:13:03.439
Caption: on trying to learn everything all at

02:13:01.439 --> 02:13:05.919
Caption: once which i&#39;m sure is a rabbit hole

02:13:03.439 --> 02:13:08.479
Caption: that many of us have fallen into let me

02:13:05.919 --> 02:13:08.479
Caption: include it

02:13:08.959 --> 02:13:14.799
Caption: and also stop comparing yourself to

02:13:11.359 --> 02:13:16.479
Caption: others this is one that&#39;s very easy to

02:13:14.799 --> 02:13:18.158
Caption: fall into as well

02:13:16.479 --> 02:13:19.759
Caption: you tend to kind of forget that other

02:13:18.159 --> 02:13:21.280
Caption: people may have had like a lot more

02:13:19.759 --> 02:13:22.238
Caption: experience than you

02:13:21.279 --> 02:13:24.158
Caption: um

02:13:22.238 --> 02:13:26.078
Caption: so comparing yourself to someone else

02:13:24.159 --> 02:13:28.479
Caption: who went through a way different journey

02:13:26.079 --> 02:13:31.520
Caption: or has been working in the industry for

02:13:28.479 --> 02:13:34.079
Caption: a few years now doesn&#39;t really help

02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:35.279
Caption: so instead try and look at them like

02:13:34.079 --> 02:13:37.199
Caption: role models

02:13:35.279 --> 02:13:39.520
Caption: or turn to them for help

02:13:37.199 --> 02:13:42.000
Caption: so it can really be helpful to share

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:42.799
Caption: your imposter feelings with others

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.399
Caption: because

02:13:42.799 --> 02:13:45.759
Caption: they will a lot of them will be able to

02:13:44.399 --> 02:13:47.520
Caption: kind of like acknowledge that they&#39;re

02:13:45.759 --> 02:13:49.439
Caption: probably experiencing the same thing

02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:50.799
Caption: from time to time or have experiences in

02:13:49.439 --> 02:13:52.159
Caption: the past

02:13:50.799 --> 02:13:54.158
Caption: um and having these feelings of

02:13:52.159 --> 02:13:56.639
Caption: knowledge can work quite well i can tell

02:13:54.159 --> 02:13:59.920
Caption: you from experience

02:13:56.639 --> 02:14:01.599
Caption: because um i share my feelings with my

02:13:59.919 --> 02:14:04.238
Caption: manager

02:14:01.599 --> 02:14:04.239
Caption: all the time

02:14:05.119 --> 02:14:08.239
Caption: i can&#39;t i can&#39;t even count the number of

02:14:06.959 --> 02:14:09.439
Caption: times that i&#39;ve been in a one-on-one

02:14:08.238 --> 02:14:11.678
Caption: being like i feel like i&#39;m not

02:14:09.439 --> 02:14:13.919
Caption: progressing fast enough and i need to

02:14:11.679 --> 02:14:15.599
Caption: know more and i need to learn more and

02:14:13.919 --> 02:14:17.439
Caption: he&#39;s just always managed to make me feel

02:14:15.599 --> 02:14:19.199
Caption: better and that&#39;s because he has like

02:14:17.439 --> 02:14:20.799
Caption: all of this experience and knowledge of

02:14:19.199 --> 02:14:23.119
Caption: like yeah he has experienced the same

02:14:20.799 --> 02:14:25.279
Caption: kind of feelings and he has seen similar

02:14:23.119 --> 02:14:28.719
Caption: things by mentoring others as well so

02:14:25.279 --> 02:14:32.000
Caption: it&#39;s incredibly helpful to have a mentor

02:14:28.719 --> 02:14:34.239
Caption: to help you out with this sort of stuff

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.199
Caption: but you now might also be wondering

02:14:34.238 --> 02:14:38.718
Caption: kristy weren&#39;t you a psychologist

02:14:37.199 --> 02:14:40.880
Caption: you should probably have some cool

02:14:38.719 --> 02:14:42.079
Caption: tricks up your sleeve right

02:14:40.879 --> 02:14:44.238
Caption: i do

02:14:42.079 --> 02:14:46.000
Caption: okay but i want to give a little bit of

02:14:44.238 --> 02:14:48.479
Caption: a disclaimer here

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:51.040
Caption: because as a psychologist we are really

02:14:48.479 --> 02:14:51.040
Caption: good at

02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:55.119
Caption: advising other people and helping

02:14:53.599 --> 02:14:57.599
Caption: guiding other people but when it comes

02:14:55.119 --> 02:15:00.399
Caption: to ourselves those rules all of a sudden

02:14:57.599 --> 02:15:01.919
Caption: don&#39;t seem to apply anymore

02:15:00.399 --> 02:15:03.839
Caption: which is why i&#39;m still having impulsive

02:15:01.919 --> 02:15:06.399
Caption: feelings

02:15:03.839 --> 02:15:07.839
Caption: but there are specifically two exercises

02:15:06.399 --> 02:15:09.919
Caption: that i wanted to share with you all that

02:15:07.839 --> 02:15:10.799
Caption: have been really helpful for myself but

02:15:09.919 --> 02:15:12.319
Caption: also

02:15:10.799 --> 02:15:14.638
Caption: clients that i have treated in the past

02:15:12.319 --> 02:15:16.879
Caption: with similar issues and these are

02:15:14.639 --> 02:15:18.320
Caption: exercises that are part of cognitive

02:15:16.879 --> 02:15:19.520
Caption: behavioral therapy and i will really do

02:15:18.319 --> 02:15:21.439
Caption: a deep dive into that because i could do

02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:23.439
Caption: a whole different talk about that but i

02:15:21.439 --> 02:15:24.959
Caption: will give a brief overview of these

02:15:23.439 --> 02:15:25.839
Caption: exercises

02:15:24.959 --> 02:15:28.639
Caption: and

02:15:25.839 --> 02:15:30.479
Caption: i have added a qr code for you to scan

02:15:28.639 --> 02:15:32.239
Caption: so you can find some worksheets related

02:15:30.479 --> 02:15:33.359
Caption: to them as well and you can look it up

02:15:32.238 --> 02:15:35.279
Caption: yourself

02:15:33.359 --> 02:15:36.879
Caption: so the first one is cognitive

02:15:35.279 --> 02:15:38.319
Caption: restructuring

02:15:36.879 --> 02:15:40.479
Caption: oh everybody&#39;s putting up their phone

02:15:38.319 --> 02:15:43.040
Caption: that&#39;s cool

02:15:40.479 --> 02:15:44.799
Caption: and cognitive restructuring is a way to

02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:46.239
Caption: really get to the root of why you are

02:15:44.799 --> 02:15:48.238
Caption: having this imposter feeling in the

02:15:46.238 --> 02:15:49.678
Caption: first place and how you came to believe

02:15:48.238 --> 02:15:51.279
Caption: them

02:15:49.679 --> 02:15:54.800
Caption: so you&#39;re kind of using this technique

02:15:51.279 --> 02:15:56.638
Caption: called socratic questioning where you

02:15:54.799 --> 02:15:58.718
Caption: just challenge the thought that you&#39;re

02:15:56.639 --> 02:16:00.400
Caption: having at the moment you might ask

02:15:58.719 --> 02:16:02.480
Caption: yourself questions like

02:16:00.399 --> 02:16:03.439
Caption: is this thought based on emotions or

02:16:02.479 --> 02:16:05.199
Caption: facts

02:16:03.439 --> 02:16:06.560
Caption: do i can i think of any facts that

02:16:05.199 --> 02:16:09.199
Caption: actually support this thought that i&#39;m

02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:12.159
Caption: having or can i think of any facts that

02:16:09.199 --> 02:16:13.760
Caption: um support the fact that i that it&#39;s not

02:16:12.159 --> 02:16:15.040
Caption: true what i&#39;m thinking

02:16:13.759 --> 02:16:17.519
Caption: and it&#39;s those kinds of questions that

02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:19.040
Caption: will help you um kind of like

02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:20.639
Caption: get to the bottom of this in a slightly

02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:22.560
Caption: more objective way which has been quite

02:16:20.639 --> 02:16:24.320
Caption: helpful for me

02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:26.639
Caption: and the next exercise is called

02:16:24.319 --> 02:16:28.158
Caption: dysfunctional thought record

02:16:26.639 --> 02:16:29.280
Caption: uh it&#39;s the same qr code by the way so

02:16:28.159 --> 02:16:32.000
Caption: you don&#39;t have to scan it again if you

02:16:29.279 --> 02:16:34.398
Caption: already have it

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.638
Caption: um this functional thought record really

02:16:34.399 --> 02:16:38.240
Caption: helps you find out what triggers your

02:16:36.638 --> 02:16:40.478
Caption: imposter thought

02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:42.559
Caption: it asks you uh to write down things like

02:16:40.478 --> 02:16:44.879
Caption: the time and date of your thought what

02:16:42.558 --> 02:16:47.040
Caption: the thought is how you would rate its

02:16:44.879 --> 02:16:48.959
Caption: intensity and emotions that come with it

02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:50.959
Caption: but the most important part of this one

02:16:48.959 --> 02:16:53.280
Caption: is that you think of alternative

02:16:50.959 --> 02:16:55.280
Caption: thoughts that could actually be more

02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:57.919
Caption: positive or helpful to replace your

02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:57.919
Caption: negative one

02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:03.439
Caption: well now so far i have been giving you a

02:17:01.598 --> 02:17:04.718
Caption: lot of tips to handle impossible

02:17:03.439 --> 02:17:06.080
Caption: feelings by yourself and this is

02:17:04.718 --> 02:17:07.919
Caption: probably a lot of the stuff that you can

02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:09.919
Caption: find online as well

02:17:07.919 --> 02:17:11.359
Caption: but one of the things that i find

02:17:09.919 --> 02:17:12.558
Caption: is really important here is that

02:17:11.359 --> 02:17:14.240
Caption: leadership can actually have an

02:17:12.558 --> 02:17:17.518
Caption: important role in helping other people

02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:17.519
Caption: with impulsive feelings too

02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:23.439
Caption: and so leaders why should you help out

02:17:20.718 --> 02:17:25.358
Caption: others with imposter feelings because it

02:17:23.439 --> 02:17:27.280
Caption: actually turns out in research that

02:17:25.359 --> 02:17:28.719
Caption: imposter feelings

02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:30.799
Caption: impact the performance of both the

02:17:28.718 --> 02:17:33.040
Caption: individual and the team

02:17:30.799 --> 02:17:35.518
Caption: it&#39;s actually correlated with job poor

02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:38.000
Caption: job performance for job satisfaction and

02:17:35.518 --> 02:17:38.000
Caption: burnout

02:17:38.638 --> 02:17:44.398
Caption: so it&#39;s important to learn and to

02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:44.399
Caption: identify impulsive feelings in others

02:17:46.399 --> 02:17:50.000
Caption: i need a little bit of help with this

02:17:47.759 --> 02:17:50.000
Caption: one

02:17:52.399 --> 02:17:56.080
Caption: so impossible feelings can be quite

02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:58.718
Caption: complex and sometimes not even that

02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:02.160
Caption: obvious your team member may seem

02:17:58.718 --> 02:18:03.759
Caption: fatigued or disinterested or

02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:06.160
Caption: maybe just completely the opposite and

02:18:03.759 --> 02:18:07.678
Caption: really on top of things and and going

02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:10.160
Caption: beyond

02:18:07.678 --> 02:18:12.799
Caption: above and beyond to try and just do the

02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:12.799
Caption: right thing and

02:18:14.319 --> 02:18:19.599
Caption: so that they can prove their worth

02:18:17.518 --> 02:18:21.919
Caption: but what about the high performer who

02:18:19.598 --> 02:18:23.279
Caption: tends to avoid these like more tricky

02:18:21.919 --> 02:18:25.598
Caption: projects

02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:27.919
Caption: or the person who doesn&#39;t put their hand

02:18:25.598 --> 02:18:30.239
Caption: up for a promotion

02:18:27.919 --> 02:18:32.240
Caption: or the person who

02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:33.919
Caption: look seems to be uncomfortable with

02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:35.120
Caption: praise and kind of just like waves it

02:18:33.919 --> 02:18:37.120
Caption: off as

02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:38.479
Caption: luck or

02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:39.919
Caption: something that they got a lot of help

02:18:38.478 --> 02:18:41.518
Caption: from other people

02:18:39.919 --> 02:18:44.000
Caption: or maybe they just appear really

02:18:41.518 --> 02:18:46.558
Caption: skeptical when you encourage them to do

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.558
Caption: something new

02:18:47.598 --> 02:18:50.718
Caption: you also want to stay attuned to

02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:53.280
Caption: negative self-talk

02:18:50.718 --> 02:18:54.000
Caption: things like a silly question

02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:55.519
Caption: or

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.200
Caption: i did really terrible on that

02:18:55.518 --> 02:18:58.239
Caption: presentation

02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:59.359
Caption: um

02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:01.359
Caption: or

02:18:59.359 --> 02:19:02.880
Caption: someone could probably someone better

02:19:01.359 --> 02:19:04.959
Caption: should probably be doing this or someone

02:19:02.879 --> 02:19:07.040
Caption: else should probably be doing this are a

02:19:04.959 --> 02:19:08.000
Caption: really good examples of self-deprecating

02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:10.160
Caption: talk

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:13.040
Caption: and can be harmful for a team member&#39;s

02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:13.040
Caption: performance as well

02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:19.839
Caption: but to be fair it can be pretty hard to

02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:21.759
Caption: walk up to a manager and talk about

02:19:19.839 --> 02:19:25.200
Caption: these kinds of feelings right

02:19:21.759 --> 02:19:26.478
Caption: so as a manager you want to be if you

02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:28.399
Caption: want to be able to have these kinds of

02:19:26.478 --> 02:19:30.478
Caption: conversations you want to show empathy

02:19:28.399 --> 02:19:32.160
Caption: and vulnerability and that means that

02:19:30.478 --> 02:19:34.239
Caption: you might have to open up about your

02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:35.759
Caption: imposter feelings first before someone

02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:37.919
Caption: else feels comfortable enough to come to

02:19:35.759 --> 02:19:37.919
Caption: you

02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:43.759
Caption: so when a team member does come to you

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:46.000
Caption: it&#39;s important that you acknowledge

02:19:43.759 --> 02:19:48.240
Caption: their feelings and maybe share one of

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.839
Caption: your own experiences oh i need to wrap

02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:51.520
Caption: this up apparently

02:19:49.839 --> 02:19:54.160
Caption: quick quick you want to organize

02:19:51.519 --> 02:19:55.599
Caption: appropriate mentoring

02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:57.359
Caption: and this doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be

02:19:55.599 --> 02:19:58.799
Caption: a senior person this can be anyone on

02:19:57.359 --> 02:20:00.399
Caption: your team who maybe have slightly more

02:19:58.799 --> 02:20:03.679
Caption: experience than

02:20:00.399 --> 02:20:05.040
Caption: the person who&#39;s just joining

02:20:03.679 --> 02:20:06.719
Caption: you want to get feedback from team

02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:08.639
Caption: members about the work environment so

02:20:06.719 --> 02:20:10.160
Caption: one thing that my new vp of engineering

02:20:08.639 --> 02:20:12.398
Caption: recently did was just have a chat with

02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:14.160
Caption: all of us and ask questions like

02:20:12.399 --> 02:20:15.520
Caption: um what do i do when you&#39;re grumpy

02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:18.080
Caption: should i just come up to you leave you

02:20:15.519 --> 02:20:18.799
Caption: alone send you a message how do you like

02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:20.479
Caption: to

02:20:18.799 --> 02:20:22.478
Caption: to get praised do you like that

02:20:20.478 --> 02:20:24.159
Caption: one-on-one am i is it okay if i share

02:20:22.478 --> 02:20:27.119
Caption: this stuff in a team things like that

02:20:24.160 --> 02:20:28.719
Caption: can all go a long way to make a person

02:20:27.120 --> 02:20:31.120
Caption: more comfortable with these sort of

02:20:28.719 --> 02:20:33.040
Caption: situations

02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:35.200
Caption: and you want to of course give praise to

02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:36.240
Caption: and celebrate wins with your entire team

02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:38.640
Caption: in the way that they all feel

02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:40.959
Caption: comfortable with

02:20:38.639 --> 02:20:42.959
Caption: so quick recap

02:20:40.959 --> 02:20:44.399
Caption: impulsive feelings and dealing with them

02:20:42.959 --> 02:20:46.080
Caption: can be quite hard

02:20:44.399 --> 02:20:48.399
Caption: but if you can acknowledge them that is

02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:49.839
Caption: the first step towards actually um

02:20:48.399 --> 02:20:51.520
Caption: dealing with them and over time you&#39;ll

02:20:49.839 --> 02:20:53.358
Caption: notice that your

02:20:51.519 --> 02:20:54.879
Caption: moments will last

02:20:53.359 --> 02:20:57.200
Caption: will be shorter and shorter and you&#39;ll

02:20:54.879 --> 02:21:01.280
Caption: have less and less of them

02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:01.280
Caption: you could do things like managing

02:21:01.359 --> 02:21:03.959
Caption: all these things that i just previously

02:21:02.719 --> 02:21:07.739
Caption: mentioned that&#39;s what you can do

02:21:03.959 --> 02:21:07.740
Caption: [Laughter]

02:21:07.839 --> 02:21:11.438
Caption: but i do really wanted to say this

02:21:09.599 --> 02:21:13.839
Caption: before i step off stage and give it to

02:21:11.439 --> 02:21:16.000
Caption: someone else it is okay to ask for

02:21:13.839 --> 02:21:18.639
Caption: professional help as well dealing with

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:20.879
Caption: imposter syndrome can be hard and to be

02:21:18.639 --> 02:21:23.199
Caption: honest i have actually have seen a

02:21:20.879 --> 02:21:24.719
Caption: counselor myself to deal with some

02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:27.759
Caption: similar kind of issues and i found that

02:21:24.719 --> 02:21:29.839
Caption: it&#39;s been really really helpful for me

02:21:27.759 --> 02:21:31.839
Caption: well thank you unfortunately i can&#39;t

02:21:29.839 --> 02:21:33.839
Caption: take any questions but feel free to come

02:21:31.839 --> 02:21:35.200
Caption: up to me after the talk or reach out on

02:32:24.799 --> 02:32:29.280
Caption: through self-awareness and that concept

02:32:26.799 --> 02:32:32.000
Caption: is not a unique one

02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:33.120
Caption: and i got the idea for this talk through

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:35.280
Caption: all the different leadership training

02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:37.520
Caption: courses i&#39;ve done and i also did a lot

02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:39.280
Caption: of research on the topic there&#39;s tons of

02:32:37.519 --> 02:32:41.679
Caption: studies that have been published about

02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:43.600
Caption: this but really the idea for the talk

02:32:41.679 --> 02:32:44.799
Caption: came through a leadership camp that i

02:32:43.599 --> 02:32:46.719
Caption: attended

02:32:44.799 --> 02:32:48.879
Caption: through rotary club and then i went on

02:32:46.719 --> 02:32:50.799
Caption: to be a camp counselor for

02:32:48.879 --> 02:32:53.280
Caption: this camp was called ryla which stands

02:32:50.799 --> 02:32:54.879
Caption: for rotary youth leadership awards and

02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:56.879
Caption: the whole camp was centered around

02:32:54.879 --> 02:32:58.639
Caption: building up your self-awareness and how

02:32:56.879 --> 02:32:59.839
Caption: that can help you to become a better

02:32:58.639 --> 02:33:01.120
Caption: leader

02:32:59.839 --> 02:33:03.280
Caption: so i was

02:33:01.120 --> 02:33:06.000
Caption: in this camp is also focused on young

02:33:03.280 --> 02:33:07.919
Caption: adults age 18 to 28. so i was lucky

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:10.240
Caption: enough to be able to attend a few years

02:33:07.919 --> 02:33:11.759
Caption: ago and then go on to council and help

02:33:10.240 --> 02:33:12.640
Caption: share those skills with other people as

02:33:11.759 --> 02:33:14.559
Caption: well

02:33:12.639 --> 02:33:17.438
Caption: and i&#39;m not trying to retrofit the camp

02:33:14.559 --> 02:33:19.839
Caption: into this talk but that idea of becoming

02:33:17.439 --> 02:33:21.680
Caption: a great leader by understanding yourself

02:33:19.839 --> 02:33:23.679
Caption: is one that has always stuck with me so

02:33:21.679 --> 02:33:25.599
Caption: i decided to put together this talk for

02:33:23.679 --> 02:33:28.000
Caption: all of you

02:33:25.599 --> 02:33:29.679
Caption: so what is leadership leadership has

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.080
Caption: many definitions

02:33:29.679 --> 02:33:34.799
Caption: i looked up the definition and it says

02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:37.200
Caption: it&#39;s the action of leading a group of

02:33:34.799 --> 02:33:39.358
Caption: people or an organization

02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:41.439
Caption: i didn&#39;t find that entirely helpful so i

02:33:39.359 --> 02:33:43.040
Caption: went on to then look up the definition

02:33:41.439 --> 02:33:45.920
Caption: of fleet

02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:48.080
Caption: and this said it&#39;s the initiative in an

02:33:45.919 --> 02:33:50.959
Caption: action an example for others to follow

02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:53.520
Caption: it so if we put that together we can say

02:33:50.959 --> 02:33:54.879
Caption: that leadership is the action of taking

02:33:53.519 --> 02:33:57.199
Caption: the initiative

02:33:54.879 --> 02:33:59.120
Caption: and setting an example for other people

02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:01.040
Caption: to then follow

02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:03.439
Caption: and i like this definition

02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:05.040
Caption: because to me a leader is somebody who

02:34:03.439 --> 02:34:08.160
Caption: has followers

02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:10.319
Caption: the followers are what make you a leader

02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:12.240
Caption: it&#39;s not someone who necessarily has it

02:34:10.319 --> 02:34:14.560
Caption: in their title or is that at the top of

02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:16.160
Caption: the ladder in a corporate organization

02:34:14.559 --> 02:34:18.159
Caption: it&#39;s the person who is out there making

02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:20.160
Caption: a difference who is checking on those

02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:22.560
Caption: teammates who might be struggling a

02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:24.719
Caption: little bit having support being a role

02:34:22.559 --> 02:34:27.040
Caption: model and setting an example really

Caption: is out at the front being the center for

02:34:42.319 --> 02:34:46.560

Caption: hear from some people in the audience

02:35:01.679 --> 02:35:06.000
Caption: what do you think makes a good leader

02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:08.160
Caption: just shout it out

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:11.280
Caption: any thoughts

02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:14.160

02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:14.160
Caption: trust yes

02:35:15.359 --> 02:35:20.800
Caption: respect definitely

02:35:18.399 --> 02:35:23.200
Caption: listening yes

02:35:20.799 --> 02:35:24.879

02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:26.799
Caption: yeah all of these traits are definitely

02:35:24.879 --> 02:35:28.240
Caption: things that we really want to see in

02:35:26.799 --> 02:35:30.398
Caption: leaders we

02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:32.879
Caption: want to be able to have them empathize

02:35:30.399 --> 02:35:34.880
Caption: with us listen to our concerns to really

02:35:32.879 --> 02:35:36.478
Caption: support us as we&#39;re doing things and

02:35:34.879 --> 02:35:39.280
Caption: understand when we&#39;re going through

02:35:36.478 --> 02:35:41.519
Caption: maybe difficult situations

02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:43.680
Caption: so they&#39;re the people who are you know

02:35:41.519 --> 02:35:45.839
Caption: supporting us through those processes um

02:35:43.679 --> 02:35:47.199
Caption: helping us when there might be maybe

02:35:45.839 --> 02:35:49.358
Caption: there&#39;s little tasks on the side that

02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:51.280
Caption: may have been forgotten to help the team

02:35:49.359 --> 02:35:53.120
Caption: reach the goal

02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:55.280
Caption: and it doesn&#39;t always have to be just

02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:57.359
Caption: one leader a lot of situations there&#39;s

02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:59.600
Caption: leaders in different aspects that all

02:35:57.359 --> 02:36:01.840
Caption: work together to help the team

02:35:59.599 --> 02:36:03.919
Caption: achieve the end goal

02:36:01.839 --> 02:36:05.438
Caption: think about in a game of basketball you

02:36:03.919 --> 02:36:08.319
Caption: have the coach

02:36:05.439 --> 02:36:10.000
Caption: you might have the team captain or you

02:36:08.319 --> 02:36:11.600
Caption: have someone who&#39;s setting up the play

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:13.040
Caption: who&#39;s making the assist and then the

02:36:11.599 --> 02:36:14.080
Caption: person who&#39;s shooting the hoop in the

02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:15.200
Caption: end

02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:17.359
Caption: all of them

02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:19.120
Caption: had their own part to play in reaching

02:36:17.359 --> 02:36:20.720
Caption: that outcome and they&#39;re all leaders in

02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:22.479
Caption: their own right they took that

02:36:20.719 --> 02:36:26.559
Caption: initiative and they supported one

02:36:22.478 --> 02:36:26.559
Caption: another to help achieve success

02:36:26.799 --> 02:36:31.519
Caption: so in the words of bill gates

02:36:28.959 --> 02:36:34.879
Caption: as we look ahead into the next century

02:36:31.519 --> 02:36:36.959
Caption: leaders will be those who empower others

02:36:34.879 --> 02:36:39.120
Caption: so how do we empower others

02:36:36.959 --> 02:36:41.839
Caption: how do we become that person that other

02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:43.839
Caption: people want to follow

02:36:41.839 --> 02:36:46.240
Caption: and it really can come down to

02:36:43.839 --> 02:36:48.000
Caption: understanding of ourselves

02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:49.839
Caption: before we can look at taking care of

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:51.679
Caption: those around us and really influencing

02:36:49.839 --> 02:36:53.679
Caption: them we first have to understand

02:36:51.679 --> 02:36:56.080
Caption: ourselves and our own actions and how we

02:36:53.679 --> 02:36:58.799
Caption: approach different situations

02:36:56.080 --> 02:37:01.280
Caption: self-awareness does not equate to

02:36:58.799 --> 02:37:03.519
Caption: leadership but it is a fundamental skill

02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:04.720
Caption: that can really help you to be a great

02:37:03.519 --> 02:37:06.719
Caption: leader

02:37:04.719 --> 02:37:09.759
Caption: and all those traits that we mentioned

02:37:06.719 --> 02:37:11.759
Caption: empathy listening active communication

02:37:09.759 --> 02:37:14.959
Caption: being authentic and supporting those

02:37:11.759 --> 02:37:16.879
Caption: around you really empowering others

02:37:14.959 --> 02:37:18.799
Caption: it first starts with understanding

02:37:16.879 --> 02:37:22.240
Caption: yourself

02:37:18.799 --> 02:37:24.879
Caption: so self-awareness well this is the

02:37:22.240 --> 02:37:26.799
Caption: act of being aware of yourself

02:37:24.879 --> 02:37:28.000
Caption: it&#39;s all about being aware of your

02:37:26.799 --> 02:37:30.478
Caption: emotions

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:32.799
Caption: your personality how you react in

02:37:30.478 --> 02:37:34.879
Caption: different situations and how all those

02:37:32.799 --> 02:37:36.719
Caption: things are perceived by others your

02:37:34.879 --> 02:37:39.040
Caption: strengths and weaknesses the skills that

02:37:36.719 --> 02:37:40.639
Caption: you have that you need to continue to to

02:37:39.040 --> 02:37:42.240
Caption: work on are the ones that you&#39;re really

02:37:40.639 --> 02:37:44.159
Caption: great at and you can really harness and

02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:47.200
Caption: use

02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:49.839
Caption: people are not born completely

02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:52.080
Caption: self-aware but as an infant as a baby we

02:37:49.839 --> 02:37:53.919
Caption: do start to develop self-awareness and

02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:55.040
Caption: we can continue to build it throughout

02:37:53.919 --> 02:37:57.200
Caption: our life

02:37:55.040 --> 02:37:59.759
Caption: however research has shown that only 10

02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:02.640
Caption: to 15 percent of people are what they

02:37:59.759 --> 02:38:03.919
Caption: consider truly self-aware

02:38:02.639 --> 02:38:06.799
Caption: well we can all work on our

02:38:03.919 --> 02:38:09.759
Caption: self-awareness and continue to build it

02:38:06.799 --> 02:38:10.879
Caption: the study of self-awareness that we know

02:38:09.759 --> 02:38:14.240
Caption: it today

02:38:10.879 --> 02:38:16.160
Caption: began in 1972 with shelley duvall and

02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:17.919
Caption: robert wookland

02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:19.520
Caption: although the concept of self-awareness

02:38:17.919 --> 02:38:21.519
Caption: is one that has been around for

02:38:19.519 --> 02:38:23.679
Caption: centuries and people have been talking

02:38:21.519 --> 02:38:25.039
Caption: and trying to understand self for a very

02:38:23.679 --> 02:38:27.519
Caption: long time

02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:29.919
Caption: with that theory from shelley duvall and

02:38:27.519 --> 02:38:30.799
Caption: robert wicklund proposed that at a given

02:38:29.919 --> 02:38:34.240
Caption: moment

02:38:30.799 --> 02:38:36.478
Caption: people can focus attention on their self

02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:37.439
Caption: or on the external environment around

02:38:36.478 --> 02:38:39.839
Caption: them

02:38:37.439 --> 02:38:43.680
Caption: and through their research they divided

02:38:39.839 --> 02:38:45.438
Caption: self-awareness into two sub-categories

02:38:43.679 --> 02:38:47.839
Caption: the first is your internal

02:38:45.439 --> 02:38:50.720
Caption: self-awareness so this is the awareness

02:38:47.839 --> 02:38:52.559
Caption: of your internal state of being and how

02:38:50.719 --> 02:38:54.839
Caption: you are your emotions and how you&#39;re

02:38:52.559 --> 02:38:57.599
Caption: reacting to things your natural

02:38:54.839 --> 02:39:00.080
Caption: tendencies and generally we don&#39;t always

02:38:57.599 --> 02:39:02.318
Caption: focus internally or on ourselves but

02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:05.679
Caption: there&#39;s certain situations that can

02:39:02.319 --> 02:39:07.919
Caption: cause our attention to be drawn inward

02:39:05.679 --> 02:39:10.719
Caption: take for a moment to take a deep breath

02:39:07.919 --> 02:39:13.120
Caption: breathe into your nose and out through

02:39:10.719 --> 02:39:13.120
Caption: your mouth

02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:16.879
Caption: most of the time you don&#39;t really think

02:39:14.879 --> 02:39:18.319
Caption: about how you&#39;re breathing but because i

02:39:16.879 --> 02:39:20.160
Caption: drew your attention to it and you

02:39:18.319 --> 02:39:22.879
Caption: actively took that deep breath in and

02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:26.000
Caption: out you have become aware of your

02:39:22.879 --> 02:39:27.358
Caption: breathing so internal self-awareness is

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:29.280
Caption: something that happens privately

02:39:27.359 --> 02:39:31.840
Caption: something inside our head of okay this

02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:33.600
Caption: is now how we&#39;re breathing in and out

02:39:31.839 --> 02:39:35.759
Caption: it&#39;s the type of awareness when you

02:39:33.599 --> 02:39:37.759
Caption: become aware of some aspect of yourself

02:39:35.759 --> 02:39:39.839
Caption: but in a way that no one else can see

02:39:37.759 --> 02:39:41.519
Caption: because it&#39;s happening inside your mind

02:39:39.839 --> 02:39:42.719
Caption: so it&#39;s an awareness of that internal

02:39:41.519 --> 02:39:44.959
Caption: state

02:39:42.719 --> 02:39:46.398
Caption: on the other hand is the external

02:39:44.959 --> 02:39:48.879
Caption: self-awareness

02:39:46.399 --> 02:39:50.560
Caption: and what this means is it&#39;s really our

02:39:48.879 --> 02:39:52.719
Caption: perceived awareness

02:39:50.559 --> 02:39:55.438
Caption: of how others see us and it&#39;s only

02:39:52.719 --> 02:39:57.438
Caption: perceived because we don&#39;t actually 100

02:39:55.439 --> 02:39:59.520
Caption: know what other people are seeing in us

02:39:57.439 --> 02:40:01.600
Caption: but we usually have some sort of idea or

02:39:59.519 --> 02:40:04.239
Caption: maybe just a guess of what people are

02:40:01.599 --> 02:40:06.398
Caption: seeing when maybe they&#39;re watching us up

02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:09.120
Caption: on stage or we&#39;re interacting with them

02:40:06.399 --> 02:40:11.840
Caption: in certain situation

02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:13.679
Caption: for example here i am up here talking

02:40:11.839 --> 02:40:16.240
Caption: and i can see you all looking at me and

02:40:13.679 --> 02:40:18.398
Caption: i&#39;m coming to some conclusions of what

02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:20.080
Caption: you might be thinking

02:40:18.399 --> 02:40:23.200
Caption: when we know that we&#39;re being watched

02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:24.560
Caption: and evaluated we often try to act in

02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:25.839
Caption: ways that we think are socially

02:40:24.559 --> 02:40:27.199
Caption: acceptable

02:40:25.839 --> 02:40:29.200
Caption: so you&#39;re in a situation with your

02:40:27.200 --> 02:40:31.280
Caption: friends and someone says a joke that

02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:32.879
Caption: might be a bit controversial

02:40:31.280 --> 02:40:35.439
Caption: you&#39;ll probably look around your friends

02:40:32.879 --> 02:40:37.280
Caption: to see how they react before you react

02:40:35.439 --> 02:40:39.359
Caption: as well so you want to make sure you fit

02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:41.200
Caption: into those societal norms

02:40:39.359 --> 02:40:42.720
Caption: and that&#39;s an example of that external

02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:44.560
Caption: self-awareness

02:40:42.719 --> 02:40:47.200
Caption: so our external self-awareness is

02:40:44.559 --> 02:40:50.159
Caption: usually influences or actions to be

02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:52.399
Caption: related to society expectations

02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:54.319
Caption: where our internal self-awareness is

02:40:52.399 --> 02:40:56.720
Caption: really driven by our personal values and

02:40:54.319 --> 02:40:58.720
Caption: the things that really mean most to us

02:40:56.719 --> 02:41:01.279
Caption: internally

02:40:58.719 --> 02:41:03.519
Caption: so dr tasha urge

02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:05.760
Caption: research self-awareness in the context

02:41:03.519 --> 02:41:07.679
Caption: of leaders and organizations and took

02:41:05.759 --> 02:41:10.879
Caption: the concept of these internal and

02:41:07.679 --> 02:41:12.199
Caption: external and categorized it into four

02:41:10.879 --> 02:41:15.599
Caption: separate

02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:18.240
Caption: sub-archetypes of self-awareness

02:41:15.599 --> 02:41:20.639
Caption: so on the bottom left corner we have

02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:21.439
Caption: what are called seekers these people

02:41:20.639 --> 02:41:22.398
Caption: have

02:41:21.439 --> 02:41:25.439
Caption: the

02:41:22.399 --> 02:41:27.120
Caption: low internal and low external so they

02:41:25.439 --> 02:41:29.280
Caption: don&#39;t really know too much about

02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:30.399
Caption: themselves but they&#39;re open-minded and

02:41:29.280 --> 02:41:31.600
Caption: they&#39;re they&#39;re

02:41:30.399 --> 02:41:33.680
Caption: open to

02:41:31.599 --> 02:41:35.839
Caption: learning new things however they

02:41:33.679 --> 02:41:38.398
Caption: probably are getting frustrated because

02:41:35.839 --> 02:41:40.000
Caption: they&#39;re not quite sure what they value

02:41:38.399 --> 02:41:43.359
Caption: and they might not understand what might

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:45.839
Caption: be happening in certain situations

02:41:43.359 --> 02:41:48.479
Caption: next we have on the top left corner

02:41:45.839 --> 02:41:49.759
Caption: those who have high internal and low

02:41:48.478 --> 02:41:52.079
Caption: external

02:41:49.759 --> 02:41:54.318
Caption: so these people are very clear on what

02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:56.799
Caption: is really most important to them but

02:41:54.319 --> 02:41:58.800
Caption: they might not be as aware of how their

02:41:56.799 --> 02:42:01.040
Caption: actions and things that they&#39;re doing

02:41:58.799 --> 02:42:03.120
Caption: are perceived by others and often

02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:05.520
Caption: they&#39;re a bit close-minded and not open

02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:08.319
Caption: to learning new things so that can harm

02:42:05.519 --> 02:42:10.079
Caption: some of their relationships with people

02:42:08.319 --> 02:42:11.280
Caption: in the bottom right corner we have

02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:14.000
Caption: pleasers

02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:16.160
Caption: these people are very highly externally

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.759
Caption: self-aware very aware of how other

02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:19.520
Caption: people are perceiving them

02:42:17.759 --> 02:42:21.279
Caption: but they&#39;re have low internal

02:42:19.519 --> 02:42:24.079
Caption: self-awareness so they&#39;re not as

02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:27.919
Caption: connected with what is imp important to

02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:30.000
Caption: them and can feel frustrated and that

02:42:27.919 --> 02:42:31.519
Caption: can hold them back from getting success

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.799
Caption: and fulfillment out of what they&#39;re

02:42:31.519 --> 02:42:34.398
Caption: doing

02:42:32.799 --> 02:42:36.559
Caption: and in the top right corner we have

02:42:34.399 --> 02:42:38.080
Caption: those 10 to 15 percent of people who are

02:42:36.559 --> 02:42:40.000
Caption: truly self-aware

02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:42.560
Caption: they have the high internal and high

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.080
Caption: external they really know

02:42:42.559 --> 02:42:46.318
Caption: they&#39;re really in touch with who they

02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:48.160
Caption: are and what they really value but

02:42:46.319 --> 02:42:50.160
Caption: they&#39;re also very aware of those around

02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:52.879
Caption: them and they&#39;re aware how they can

02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:54.719
Caption: adapt to those current situations

02:42:52.879 --> 02:42:57.120
Caption: now it&#39;s all the scale and a lot of it

02:42:54.719 --> 02:42:59.279
Caption: depends on the situation all that but we

02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:02.080
Caption: can work on building our different parts

02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:04.720
Caption: of our self-awareness

02:43:02.080 --> 02:43:05.759
Caption: so if we&#39;re looking though some of those

02:43:04.719 --> 02:43:08.160
Caption: things that we&#39;re talking about the

02:43:05.759 --> 02:43:09.839
Caption: self-awareness can be negative so if

02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:12.799
Caption: we&#39;re focusing on the wrong things if

02:43:09.839 --> 02:43:15.679
Caption: we&#39;re focusing term too much internally

02:43:12.799 --> 02:43:17.759
Caption: we become maybe a bit self-obsessed or

02:43:15.679 --> 02:43:19.919
Caption: you have trouble understanding you know

02:43:17.759 --> 02:43:22.080
Caption: challenging situations or

02:43:19.919 --> 02:43:23.040
Caption: things that might be out of the norm for

02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:25.679
Caption: us

02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:28.479
Caption: or if we&#39;re focusing too much externally

02:43:25.679 --> 02:43:30.639
Caption: we can become quite anxious and

02:43:28.478 --> 02:43:32.239
Caption: always aware of things that other people

02:43:30.639 --> 02:43:33.759
Caption: are judging us or things that are

02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:36.160
Caption: negatively happening

02:43:33.759 --> 02:43:38.160
Caption: so we have to be careful with our our

02:43:36.160 --> 02:43:39.600
Caption: management of self-awareness there&#39;s

02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:42.319
Caption: something that&#39;s called the sadder but

02:43:39.599 --> 02:43:44.398
Caption: wiser paradox it says the more we learn

02:43:42.319 --> 02:43:47.520
Caption: about ourselves it not only makes us

02:43:44.399 --> 02:43:50.720
Caption: wiser but it can also make us sadder

02:43:47.519 --> 02:43:52.318
Caption: so we need to change how we address the

02:43:50.719 --> 02:43:54.559
Caption: self-awareness and make sure we&#39;re not

02:43:52.319 --> 02:43:56.959
Caption: mulling over the negative emotions and

02:43:54.559 --> 02:43:58.478
Caption: instead reflecting objectively on the

02:43:56.959 --> 02:44:00.399
Caption: positives

02:43:58.478 --> 02:44:03.199
Caption: and we can do this by looking at the

02:44:00.399 --> 02:44:05.840
Caption: questions that we&#39;re asking ourselves

02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:07.759
Caption: we need to make sure our introspection

02:44:05.839 --> 02:44:09.519
Caption: is on that positive side because if we

02:44:07.759 --> 02:44:12.160
Caption: just start reflecting without the right

02:44:09.519 --> 02:44:13.839
Caption: context it doesn&#39;t necessarily make us

02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:16.399
Caption: happy it can make us worse because we&#39;re

02:44:13.839 --> 02:44:18.240
Caption: focusing on the wrong things

02:44:16.399 --> 02:44:20.720
Caption: and research has shown that we&#39;re not

02:44:18.240 --> 02:44:22.640
Caption: able to pull up all of our unconscious

02:44:20.719 --> 02:44:24.799
Caption: thoughts feelings and emotions

02:44:22.639 --> 02:44:27.040
Caption: and as you learned in the chemo keynote

02:44:24.799 --> 02:44:29.040
Caption: this morning as well your memory can be

02:44:27.040 --> 02:44:30.719
Caption: wrong you can if you&#39;re looking at

02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:33.120
Caption: something in a negative context when

02:44:30.719 --> 02:44:35.200
Caption: you&#39;re remembering it you can end up

02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:36.080
Caption: having these negative emotions connected

02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:37.919
Caption: to it

02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:40.399
Caption: so we need to focus on moving forward

02:44:37.919 --> 02:44:42.160
Caption: and instead of fixating on what happens

02:44:40.399 --> 02:44:44.399
Caption: and we can do this by changing the

02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:47.040
Caption: questions that we ask ourselves instead

02:44:44.399 --> 02:44:48.800
Caption: of asking why we need to ask what

02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:49.759
Caption: instead of saying why me why did this

02:44:48.799 --> 02:44:52.478
Caption: happen

02:44:49.759 --> 02:44:55.120
Caption: look at what can i do to make it better

02:44:52.478 --> 02:44:56.639
Caption: what can i change what can i learn from

02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:58.240
Caption: this situation

02:44:56.639 --> 02:45:00.719
Caption: instead of asking

02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:03.359
Caption: why am i so upset look at what can make

02:45:00.719 --> 02:45:06.000
Caption: me happy what can i do to change this

02:45:03.359 --> 02:45:08.399
Caption: situation focusing on becoming that

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:10.959
Caption: aware archetype working on both the

02:45:08.399 --> 02:45:12.880
Caption: internal and external awareness looking

02:45:10.959 --> 02:45:14.559
Caption: at what we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re feeling

02:45:12.879 --> 02:45:17.358
Caption: and what our blind spots of what we

02:45:14.559 --> 02:45:18.559
Caption: might not be aware be

02:45:17.359 --> 02:45:20.720
Caption: and there&#39;s different tools that can

02:45:18.559 --> 02:45:22.719
Caption: help us do this one of them is what&#39;s

02:45:20.719 --> 02:45:24.959
Caption: called the jahari window

02:45:22.719 --> 02:45:27.358
Caption: so this is an activity

02:45:24.959 --> 02:45:29.359
Caption: where you get a list of adjectives that

02:45:27.359 --> 02:45:31.359
Caption: describe a person

02:45:29.359 --> 02:45:33.919
Caption: so it can be something like cheerful

02:45:31.359 --> 02:45:35.279
Caption: excited maybe reserved something like

02:45:33.919 --> 02:45:37.679
Caption: that and

02:45:35.279 --> 02:45:39.359
Caption: you and a friend go through the list and

02:45:37.679 --> 02:45:41.438
Caption: you circle all the adjectives that you

02:45:39.359 --> 02:45:43.439
Caption: think describe yourself and your friends

02:45:41.439 --> 02:45:44.720
Caption: circles adjectives that they think

02:45:43.439 --> 02:45:47.439
Caption: describes you

02:45:44.719 --> 02:45:50.719
Caption: you then compare the two lists and the

02:45:47.439 --> 02:45:52.399
Caption: adjectives that you both circle are part

02:45:50.719 --> 02:45:53.759
Caption: of your external self so this is the

02:45:52.399 --> 02:45:55.200
Caption: things that you&#39;re reflecting to others

02:45:53.759 --> 02:45:57.120
Caption: that they&#39;re aware of

02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:58.959
Caption: the things that only you circled is

02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:00.160
Caption: that&#39;s your internal self things that

02:45:58.959 --> 02:46:02.719
Caption: you find

02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:04.640
Caption: you are part of you but maybe other

02:46:02.719 --> 02:46:07.358
Caption: people don&#39;t see that then your blind

02:46:04.639 --> 02:46:09.199
Caption: spots are things that other people see

02:46:07.359 --> 02:46:11.120
Caption: in you but you don&#39;t necessarily see in

02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:12.640
Caption: yourself so there&#39;s a few different

02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:14.799
Caption: tools and techniques that you can do to

02:46:12.639 --> 02:46:17.120
Caption: help you build up these skills

02:46:14.799 --> 02:46:18.959
Caption: and if we continue to do that reflection

02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:20.319
Caption: we can get the positives out of

02:46:18.959 --> 02:46:22.319
Caption: self-awareness

02:46:20.319 --> 02:46:23.439
Caption: we can change those questions from why

02:46:22.319 --> 02:46:25.439
Caption: to what

02:46:23.439 --> 02:46:26.960
Caption: and get an increased understanding of

02:46:25.439 --> 02:46:28.960
Caption: our self-development needs and the

02:46:26.959 --> 02:46:31.519
Caption: things that we need to work on

02:46:28.959 --> 02:46:33.359
Caption: and that around us can help us become

02:46:31.519 --> 02:46:36.000
Caption: more proactive at work more

02:46:33.359 --> 02:46:37.600
Caption: understanding of others more open-minded

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:39.519
Caption: and willing to take on the initiative

02:46:37.599 --> 02:46:42.559
Caption: and be able to

02:46:39.519 --> 02:46:44.719
Caption: do well in challenging situations or

02:46:42.559 --> 02:46:47.599
Caption: when faced with adversity

02:46:44.719 --> 02:46:50.318
Caption: it can make us become more successful

02:46:47.599 --> 02:46:52.639
Caption: and have more satisfied employees and

02:46:50.319 --> 02:46:54.479
Caption: teammates around us and it can even lead

02:46:52.639 --> 02:46:57.358
Caption: to organizations becoming more

02:46:54.478 --> 02:46:59.839
Caption: successful and profitable as well

02:46:57.359 --> 02:47:00.720
Caption: so to develop these self-awareness

02:46:59.839 --> 02:47:02.160
Caption: skills

02:47:00.719 --> 02:47:04.000
Caption: there&#39;s other tools such as

02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:05.439
Caption: understanding our internal self and our

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:08.559
Caption: personality

02:47:05.439 --> 02:47:11.120
Caption: so our personality is usually determined

02:47:08.559 --> 02:47:13.919
Caption: by our genetics but also environments

02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:15.759
Caption: and situations and in how we&#39;re erased

02:47:13.919 --> 02:47:18.319
Caption: and it&#39;s the characteristic patterns of

02:47:15.759 --> 02:47:20.478
Caption: like how we think and behave and act in

02:47:18.319 --> 02:47:22.720
Caption: certain situations and there&#39;s many

02:47:20.478 --> 02:47:24.239
Caption: different tools that can help us to

02:47:22.719 --> 02:47:25.599
Caption: understand a bit more about our

02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:27.680
Caption: personality

02:47:25.599 --> 02:47:29.679
Caption: a lot of these might not be 100 correct

02:47:27.679 --> 02:47:31.839
Caption: and it might be influenced by the

02:47:29.679 --> 02:47:33.278
Caption: situation in which you took the test but

02:47:31.839 --> 02:47:35.438
Caption: it can help guide you to understand

02:47:33.279 --> 02:47:38.160
Caption: yourself a little bit more

02:47:35.439 --> 02:47:40.000
Caption: so one that i&#39;ve taken in the past that

02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:42.160
Caption: i found was useful was called the disk

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:45.200
Caption: theory so this separates your

02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:46.240
Caption: personality into fortrate and you get a

02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:48.080
Caption: report

02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:50.240
Caption: that shows how you might act in certain

02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:52.080
Caption: situations whether that&#39;s when there&#39;s a

02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:53.839
Caption: conflict arising or you&#39;re faced with a

02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:55.200
Caption: challenge or you&#39;re doing something you

02:47:53.839 --> 02:47:57.679
Caption: really enjoy

02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:58.959
Caption: it breaks it down into four categories

02:47:57.679 --> 02:48:01.438
Caption: first is

02:47:58.959 --> 02:48:04.240
Caption: more dominant which is someone who&#39;s

02:48:01.439 --> 02:48:05.680
Caption: more results-oriented strong-willed or

02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:07.680
Caption: often direct

02:48:05.679 --> 02:48:10.559
Caption: next is the influence being more

02:48:07.679 --> 02:48:12.799
Caption: optimistic lively enthusiastic

02:48:10.559 --> 02:48:14.478
Caption: then steadiness which is even tempered

02:48:12.799 --> 02:48:16.719
Caption: patient and tactful

02:48:14.478 --> 02:48:18.639
Caption: and then conscious

02:48:16.719 --> 02:48:21.919
Caption: i have trouble saying that word a bit

02:48:18.639 --> 02:48:24.159
Caption: more analytical and semantic as well

02:48:21.919 --> 02:48:26.799
Caption: and it&#39;s looking at really how you

02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:28.799
Caption: prefer to focus in on the world how you

02:48:26.799 --> 02:48:30.398
Caption: process information and react in

02:48:28.799 --> 02:48:31.759
Caption: different scenarios

02:48:30.399 --> 02:48:33.359
Caption: and these frameworks really just give

02:48:31.759 --> 02:48:35.438
Caption: you a better understanding of yourself

02:48:33.359 --> 02:48:37.919
Caption: but can also help you understand those

02:48:35.439 --> 02:48:39.680
Caption: around you so if you do these tests

02:48:37.919 --> 02:48:42.000
Caption: with some of your team members and then

02:48:39.679 --> 02:48:43.919
Caption: compare the results it can really help

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:45.200
Caption: you to understand how you can work

02:48:43.919 --> 02:48:47.040
Caption: better together

02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:49.600
Caption: i had a situation where i had a

02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:51.759
Caption: colleague who was in a similar position

02:48:49.599 --> 02:48:54.080
Caption: of mine and we&#39;re often working together

02:48:51.759 --> 02:48:56.719
Caption: but constantly butting heads

02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:59.200
Caption: i had a hard time communicating with her

02:48:56.719 --> 02:49:01.120
Caption: and really just you know underst

02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:02.799
Caption: difficulty understanding her approach to

02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:05.439
Caption: different situations

02:49:02.799 --> 02:49:08.240
Caption: but we took this test and compared our

02:49:05.439 --> 02:49:10.399
Caption: results and she was super high on the d

02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:12.479
Caption: side the d and c side and i was really

02:49:10.399 --> 02:49:14.000
Caption: high on the s and i side so completely

02:49:12.478 --> 02:49:15.599
Caption: opposite scales

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.959
Caption: of the spectrum

02:49:15.599 --> 02:49:18.719
Caption: but because of this i was able to

02:49:16.959 --> 02:49:20.799
Caption: understand her a little bit better and

02:49:18.719 --> 02:49:22.879
Caption: that allowed me to then adjust my

02:49:20.799 --> 02:49:24.478
Caption: approach when i was working with her and

02:49:22.879 --> 02:49:27.599
Caption: understand a bit more when she was

02:49:24.478 --> 02:49:30.959
Caption: communicating with me in a way that i

02:49:27.599 --> 02:49:32.719
Caption: naturally did not enjoy as much so

02:49:30.959 --> 02:49:34.559
Caption: helped us work better together in the

02:49:32.719 --> 02:49:36.879
Caption: end

02:49:34.559 --> 02:49:38.879
Caption: along with understanding our personality

02:49:36.879 --> 02:49:41.279
Caption: type we can help to understand our

02:49:38.879 --> 02:49:43.040
Caption: leadership styles and look at developing

02:49:41.279 --> 02:49:44.879
Caption: different types of leadership styles and

02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:48.240
Caption: adjusting them depending on our

02:49:44.879 --> 02:49:50.080
Caption: situation with our organization

02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:50.879
Caption: this is called the

02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:53.200
Caption: full

02:49:50.879 --> 02:49:54.879
Caption: range leadership model and it&#39;s really

02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:57.759
Caption: dividing into

02:49:54.879 --> 02:50:00.240
Caption: uh four or three types one that&#39;s split

02:49:57.759 --> 02:50:01.839
Caption: across two subcategories and the first

02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:04.640
Caption: leadership type is what&#39;s called the

02:50:01.839 --> 02:50:06.799
Caption: laissez-faire and this is really giving

02:50:04.639 --> 02:50:09.199
Caption: the empowerment to your team members and

02:50:06.799 --> 02:50:11.120
Caption: those around you this is letting them

02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:13.359
Caption: make the decisions and really empowering

02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:15.839
Caption: them so it&#39;s the the least sort of

02:50:13.359 --> 02:50:18.560
Caption: hands-on and it&#39;s really good if your

02:50:15.839 --> 02:50:20.559
Caption: team is really highly skilled and highly

02:50:18.559 --> 02:50:22.398
Caption: experienced and trustworthy to reach

02:50:20.559 --> 02:50:24.239
Caption: that goal really empowering them to be

02:50:22.399 --> 02:50:26.399
Caption: the leaders themselves

02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:29.279
Caption: the next is the transactional leadership

02:50:26.399 --> 02:50:31.520
Caption: which is more about motivating through

02:50:29.279 --> 02:50:33.600
Caption: a system of rewards and and maybe

02:50:31.519 --> 02:50:35.839
Caption: punishments um

02:50:33.599 --> 02:50:38.318
Caption: and that&#39;s broken into categories of

02:50:35.839 --> 02:50:40.318
Caption: where management only steps in

02:50:38.319 --> 02:50:41.680
Caption: if the team isn&#39;t doing well otherwise

02:50:40.319 --> 02:50:44.800
Caption: lets them keep going and giving them

02:50:41.679 --> 02:50:46.000
Caption: rewards and the other is focused on that

02:50:44.799 --> 02:50:48.318
Caption: reward

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:50.478
Caption: of the objectives

02:50:48.319 --> 02:50:53.040
Caption: this is good if your organization

02:50:50.478 --> 02:50:55.759
Caption: is uh really wanting to standardize

02:50:53.040 --> 02:50:59.279
Caption: practices and developing on a journey of

02:50:55.759 --> 02:51:00.639
Caption: becoming a highly effective uh operating

02:50:59.279 --> 02:51:03.040
Caption: team

02:51:00.639 --> 02:51:05.358
Caption: and it yeah it&#39;s helpful it helps for

02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:06.399
Caption: standardizing those practices the the

02:51:05.359 --> 02:51:08.399
Caption: last

02:51:06.399 --> 02:51:10.279
Caption: type is the transformational leadership

02:51:08.399 --> 02:51:13.279
Caption: this is about really being that

02:51:10.279 --> 02:51:15.200
Caption: inspirational motivation

02:51:13.279 --> 02:51:17.279
Caption: visionary role model that people look

02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:18.799
Caption: for and it&#39;s been proven to be the most

02:51:17.279 --> 02:51:21.200
Caption: effective

02:51:18.799 --> 02:51:23.120
Caption: it has more of a humanitarian approach

02:51:21.200 --> 02:51:25.439
Caption: and is really underpinned by

02:51:23.120 --> 02:51:26.160
Caption: self-awareness as well

02:51:25.439 --> 02:51:28.000
Caption: so

02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:29.359
Caption: these different types

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:31.359
Caption: you can have different styles and you

02:51:29.359 --> 02:51:32.880
Caption: can also adapt and change your style

02:51:31.359 --> 02:51:35.840
Caption: it&#39;s important to get an understanding

02:51:32.879 --> 02:51:38.799
Caption: of how do you like to lead others

02:51:35.839 --> 02:51:41.358
Caption: we can also look to develop our

02:51:38.799 --> 02:51:43.358
Caption: leadership skills such as communication

02:51:41.359 --> 02:51:45.279
Caption: research has found that communication is

02:51:43.359 --> 02:51:46.800
Caption: central to leadership

02:51:45.279 --> 02:51:49.680
Caption: internal communication in an

02:51:46.799 --> 02:51:50.719
Caption: organization can significantly

02:51:49.679 --> 02:51:54.799
Caption: increase

02:51:50.719 --> 02:51:56.959
Caption: a someone&#39;s your team&#39;s productivity

02:51:54.799 --> 02:52:01.278
Caption: and there is also a

02:51:56.959 --> 02:52:03.438
Caption: theory that communication in a message

02:52:01.279 --> 02:52:04.399
Caption: is seven percent

02:52:03.439 --> 02:52:08.319
Caption: verbal

02:52:04.399 --> 02:52:10.000
Caption: 38 tone in expression and 55

02:52:08.319 --> 02:52:12.080
Caption: body language

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:14.399
Caption: so there is a bit of a debate on the

02:52:12.080 --> 02:52:16.240
Caption: exact percentages that everything goes

02:52:14.399 --> 02:52:19.200
Caption: across but there&#39;s a general

02:52:16.240 --> 02:52:21.680
Caption: understanding that 70 to 90

02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:23.520
Caption: of communication is non-verbal

02:52:21.679 --> 02:52:25.919
Caption: so that means it&#39;s really important for

02:52:23.519 --> 02:52:28.478
Caption: us to think about how we&#39;re delivering

02:52:25.919 --> 02:52:31.040
Caption: messages to our teammates are you just

02:52:28.478 --> 02:52:33.039
Caption: sending an email with an important team

02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:36.080
Caption: update or are you putting out a video or

02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:37.359
Caption: maybe jumping on a video call and a chat

02:52:36.080 --> 02:52:39.439
Caption: think about how you like to be

02:52:37.359 --> 02:52:40.640
Caption: communicated to as well

02:52:39.439 --> 02:52:43.600
Caption: do you like to have all of the

02:52:40.639 --> 02:52:45.040
Caption: information up front before a meeting or

02:52:43.599 --> 02:52:47.599
Caption: do you like to just have a short quick

02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:49.439
Caption: summary and understand that and

02:52:47.599 --> 02:52:51.438
Caption: communicate it back to your team which

02:52:49.439 --> 02:52:52.560
Caption: means they will in turn work better with

02:52:51.439 --> 02:52:54.720
Caption: you

02:52:52.559 --> 02:52:55.679
Caption: especially now that we&#39;re in you know

02:52:54.719 --> 02:52:58.559
Caption: pretty much

02:52:55.679 --> 02:53:00.799
Caption: a lot of remote based working situations

02:52:58.559 --> 02:53:02.159
Caption: that communication is very important and

02:53:00.799 --> 02:53:05.278
Caption: using all the different tools that we

02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:07.040
Caption: have to keep our communication styles

02:53:05.279 --> 02:53:08.879
Caption: from just being verbal and using those

02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:09.839
Caption: tone expressions as well

02:53:08.879 --> 02:53:11.279
Caption: using all of the

02:53:09.839 --> 02:53:14.478
Caption: [Music]

02:53:11.279 --> 02:53:16.800
Caption: gifs and little icons slack reacts

02:53:14.478 --> 02:53:18.799
Caption: whatever it may be to show your emotion

02:53:16.799 --> 02:53:20.240
Caption: throughout your communication

02:53:18.799 --> 02:53:21.919
Caption: this can help you connect better with

02:53:20.240 --> 02:53:24.319
Caption: your friends colleagues and your team

02:53:21.919 --> 02:53:25.519
Caption: members and really become an effective

02:53:24.319 --> 02:53:28.160
Caption: leader that has that strong

02:53:25.519 --> 02:53:28.159
Caption: communication

02:53:28.399 --> 02:53:32.160
Caption: for me the next most important

02:53:30.399 --> 02:53:34.880
Caption: leadership skill that&#39;s underpinned by

02:53:32.160 --> 02:53:38.719
Caption: self-awareness is emotional intelligence

02:53:34.879 --> 02:53:40.799
Caption: this is sometimes referred to as eq and

02:53:38.719 --> 02:53:42.879
Caption: the first thing that is essential for

02:53:40.799 --> 02:53:44.879
Caption: any degree of emotional intelligence is

02:53:42.879 --> 02:53:45.839
Caption: that self-awareness and understanding of

02:53:44.879 --> 02:53:47.519
Caption: ourself

02:53:45.839 --> 02:53:49.279
Caption: because emotional intelligence is all

02:53:47.519 --> 02:53:51.519
Caption: about being able to recognize our

02:53:49.279 --> 02:53:54.479
Caption: emotions to understand the emotions that

02:53:51.519 --> 02:53:56.639
Caption: we may be feeling but also how we react

02:53:54.478 --> 02:53:58.559
Caption: when we&#39;re feeling these emotions and

02:53:56.639 --> 02:54:01.040
Caption: the next step is then being able to

02:53:58.559 --> 02:54:02.639
Caption: control those emotions in those

02:54:01.040 --> 02:54:04.399
Caption: situations

02:54:02.639 --> 02:54:06.879
Caption: so there are four components of

02:54:04.399 --> 02:54:08.800
Caption: emotional intelligence the first is

02:54:06.879 --> 02:54:11.919
Caption: self-awareness the self-awareness is a

02:54:08.799 --> 02:54:14.080
Caption: sub-category of emotional intelligence

02:54:11.919 --> 02:54:16.959
Caption: but it&#39;s really focused on the

02:54:14.080 --> 02:54:19.919
Caption: self-awareness of your emotions are you

02:54:16.959 --> 02:54:21.279
Caption: feeling happy anxious angry scared

02:54:19.919 --> 02:54:23.599
Caption: excited

02:54:21.279 --> 02:54:26.720
Caption: what emotion are you feeling

02:54:23.599 --> 02:54:28.639
Caption: the next is the self-management

02:54:26.719 --> 02:54:31.040
Caption: so that&#39;s being able to then control

02:54:28.639 --> 02:54:33.120
Caption: those emotions especially in a workplace

02:54:31.040 --> 02:54:34.879
Caption: organization if there&#39;s something that

02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:37.759
Caption: makes you angry you don&#39;t want to lash

02:54:34.879 --> 02:54:39.679
Caption: out and create a negative situation you

02:54:37.759 --> 02:54:41.679
Caption: want to be able to control those

02:54:39.679 --> 02:54:43.120
Caption: you also need to be able to adapt when

02:54:41.679 --> 02:54:44.719
Caption: things are changing

02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:46.719
Caption: and to

02:54:44.719 --> 02:54:48.478
Caption: have a positive outlook on things that

02:54:46.719 --> 02:54:50.318
Caption: are happening as well

02:54:48.478 --> 02:54:53.039
Caption: the next step is that social awareness

02:54:50.319 --> 02:54:55.520
Caption: so really being empathetic to those

02:54:53.040 --> 02:54:58.160
Caption: around you into the team you can break

02:54:55.519 --> 02:55:00.879
Caption: empathy down into three parts the first

02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:03.839
Caption: is cognitive which is all about i know

02:55:00.879 --> 02:55:05.279
Caption: how you think the next is emotional i

02:55:03.839 --> 02:55:07.919
Caption: know how you feel

02:55:05.279 --> 02:55:10.000
Caption: and the next is empathetic concern which

02:55:07.919 --> 02:55:11.839
Caption: is i care about you

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:13.759
Caption: and great leaders are those that can

02:55:11.839 --> 02:55:15.919
Caption: really be empathetic to you in those

02:55:13.759 --> 02:55:17.759
Caption: different situations talked about being

02:55:15.919 --> 02:55:20.879
Caption: understanding being supportive

02:55:17.759 --> 02:55:22.639
Caption: especially in times like through kobed

02:55:20.879 --> 02:55:24.639
Caption: when we have you know our kids that

02:55:22.639 --> 02:55:26.239
Caption: we&#39;re looking after or we have family

02:55:24.639 --> 02:55:28.478
Caption: members that might be unwell it&#39;s really

02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:30.799
Caption: important to have empathetic and

02:55:28.478 --> 02:55:33.119
Caption: emotionally intelligent leaders

02:55:30.799 --> 02:55:35.200
Caption: and in turn this also is important for

02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:36.639
Caption: organizational awareness if something

02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:38.240
Caption: negative is happening with your

02:55:36.639 --> 02:55:40.559
Caption: organization or your team is

02:55:38.240 --> 02:55:42.799
Caption: collectively experiencing some sort of

02:55:40.559 --> 02:55:45.119
Caption: emotion being aware of that and then

02:55:42.799 --> 02:55:48.478
Caption: also being aware of how you can help

02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:49.600
Caption: address it and how you can manage those

02:55:48.478 --> 02:55:52.159
Caption: emotions

02:55:49.599 --> 02:55:53.839
Caption: in the team by being an influencer by

02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:55.520
Caption: being a coach or a mentor and helping

02:55:53.839 --> 02:55:58.000
Caption: other people then in turn manage their

02:55:55.519 --> 02:55:59.759
Caption: emotions being a diffuser in certain

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.959
Caption: situations or helping to uplift your

02:55:59.759 --> 02:56:03.599
Caption: team when things

02:56:00.959 --> 02:56:06.160
Caption: might not be going so well

02:56:03.599 --> 02:56:07.839
Caption: so harnessing these emotions can really

02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:10.879
Caption: help us to achieve our goal and it&#39;s all

02:56:07.839 --> 02:56:13.279
Caption: underpinned by that self-awareness

02:56:10.879 --> 02:56:16.080

02:56:13.279 --> 02:56:17.760

02:56:57.040 --> 02:57:01.359

02:57:27.519 --> 02:57:33.278

02:57:39.519 --> 02:57:44.318
Caption: situations especially if things maybe

02:57:42.240 --> 02:57:45.520

02:57:47.759 --> 02:57:52.160
Caption: reacting negatively take a step back to

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:54.160

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:29.759
Caption: so if a leader has strong self-awareness

03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:31.680
Caption: this will naturally lead to followers

03:03:29.759 --> 03:03:33.919
Caption: being self-leaders because they&#39;ll see

03:03:31.679 --> 03:03:35.759
Caption: the guidance and inspiration from those

03:03:33.919 --> 03:03:37.679
Caption: leaders around them where the leaders

03:03:35.759 --> 03:03:40.080
Caption: are you know talking about goal setting

03:03:37.679 --> 03:03:42.080
Caption: and these kind of things like that a

03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:43.520
Caption: follower will then start to set these

03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:45.279
Caption: goals for themselves and drive

03:03:43.519 --> 03:03:47.839
Caption: themselves forward

03:03:45.279 --> 03:03:49.520
Caption: in turn that will make the leader more

03:03:47.839 --> 03:03:52.559
Caption: confident they&#39;ll have greater

03:03:49.519 --> 03:03:54.559
Caption: self-efficacy and they&#39;ll continue to be

03:03:52.559 --> 03:03:56.000
Caption: better leaders and reflect that back to

03:03:54.559 --> 03:03:58.478
Caption: their followers

03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:01.679
Caption: and they also found that this continues

03:03:58.478 --> 03:04:04.398
Caption: on so that their followers are then more

03:04:01.679 --> 03:04:06.160
Caption: likely to become leaders themselves they

03:04:04.399 --> 03:04:08.640
Caption: see the role models and the actions that

03:04:06.160 --> 03:04:10.319
Caption: you&#39;re doing as a leader and they become

03:04:08.639 --> 03:04:11.919
Caption: they&#39;re more likely to become a leader

03:04:10.319 --> 03:04:13.600
Caption: and they&#39;re also more likely to be

03:04:11.919 --> 03:04:15.839
Caption: nominated for promotion and more

03:04:13.599 --> 03:04:16.959
Caption: successful in their career

03:04:15.839 --> 03:04:19.120
Caption: so through working through your

03:04:16.959 --> 03:04:20.879
Caption: self-awareness your team and your

03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:23.919

03:04:23.919 --> 03:04:28.160
Caption: and not only will your team become

03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:29.520
Caption: better leaders but your organization and

03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:31.600
Caption: the company that you&#39;re working for will

03:04:29.519 --> 03:04:34.719
Caption: benefit from this as well

03:04:31.599 --> 03:04:35.839
Caption: enrique research has demonstrated that

03:04:34.719 --> 03:04:37.438
Caption: leadership

03:04:35.839 --> 03:04:40.000

03:04:37.439 --> 03:04:42.000
Caption: overall performance of a company

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:43.759
Caption: workers are more trusting of software

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:45.120
Caption: leaders because those leaders are are

03:04:43.759 --> 03:04:47.200
Caption: empathetic they&#39;re people that we can

03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:49.120
Caption: approach their problems we can be open

03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:51.439
Caption: about when things are going wrong

03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:53.200
Caption: we can talk about you know failures and

03:04:51.439 --> 03:04:55.920
Caption: but look at them in a positive light and

03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:58.319
Caption: learn from it and move forward

03:04:55.919 --> 03:05:00.319
Caption: maya angelou said i&#39;ve learned that

03:04:58.319 --> 03:05:02.240
Caption: people will forget what you said people

03:05:00.319 --> 03:05:04.240
Caption: will forget what you did

03:05:02.240 --> 03:05:05.759
Caption: but people will never forget how you

03:05:04.240 --> 03:05:07.759
Caption: made them feel

03:05:05.759 --> 03:05:09.438
Caption: self-aware leaders and teammates can

03:05:07.759 --> 03:05:10.398
Caption: really make an impact

03:05:09.439 --> 03:05:12.160
Caption: and be

03:05:10.399 --> 03:05:15.040
Caption: more engaged in their work and in the

03:05:12.160 --> 03:05:17.759
Caption: end produce better results

03:05:15.040 --> 03:05:20.240
Caption: so we can build self-awareness first by

03:05:17.759 --> 03:05:22.639
Caption: understanding ourselves practicing and

03:05:20.240 --> 03:05:25.040
Caption: reevaluating ourselves in the context of

03:05:22.639 --> 03:05:26.559
Caption: others using different tools to learn

03:05:25.040 --> 03:05:28.639
Caption: about how we approach different

03:05:26.559 --> 03:05:30.959
Caption: situations what are our natural

03:05:28.639 --> 03:05:33.040
Caption: personality types what are our strengths

03:05:30.959 --> 03:05:34.478
Caption: and weaknesses what are some areas that

03:05:33.040 --> 03:05:36.559
Caption: we need to work on and when do we need

03:05:34.478 --> 03:05:38.719
Caption: to rely on others

03:05:36.559 --> 03:05:40.000
Caption: they actually found that

03:05:38.719 --> 03:05:42.559
Caption: people

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:44.799
Caption: can build self-awareness by putting

03:05:42.559 --> 03:05:47.599
Caption: themselves in situations where their

03:05:44.799 --> 03:05:49.519
Caption: focus is naturally drawn inward

03:05:47.599 --> 03:05:51.278
Caption: they did this by putting people in front

03:05:49.519 --> 03:05:53.358
Caption: of a mirror and recording them and

03:05:51.279 --> 03:05:55.680
Caption: recording their actions and then having

03:05:53.359 --> 03:05:58.160
Caption: them watch themselves back

03:05:55.679 --> 03:05:59.599
Caption: so as much as a lot of us hate watching

03:05:58.160 --> 03:06:01.919
Caption: ourselves

03:05:59.599 --> 03:06:04.000
Caption: this really helps us become self-aware

03:06:01.919 --> 03:06:05.919
Caption: whenever i do a presentation i always go

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:07.599
Caption: back and watch the recording because

03:06:05.919 --> 03:06:09.519
Caption: that helps me learn the things that i

03:06:07.599 --> 03:06:11.839
Caption: need to work on and things that i can

03:06:09.519 --> 03:06:13.519
Caption: improve for next time so put yourself in

03:06:11.839 --> 03:06:16.639
Caption: those situations where you&#39;re being

03:06:13.519 --> 03:06:18.719
Caption: drawn to your yourself and you&#39;re seeing

03:06:16.639 --> 03:06:21.040
Caption: thinking about or understanding how

03:06:18.719 --> 03:06:23.200
Caption: you&#39;ve acted in different situations to

03:06:21.040 --> 03:06:24.240
Caption: help build that self-awareness

03:06:23.200 --> 03:06:26.160
Caption: there&#39;s also things called

03:06:24.240 --> 03:06:28.000
Caption: self-awareness triggers which are

03:06:26.160 --> 03:06:30.879
Caption: usually some big events that happen in

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:33.359
Caption: our life that really make us reflect and

03:06:30.879 --> 03:06:34.559
Caption: understand a bit of ourselves on a

03:06:33.359 --> 03:06:36.720
Caption: deeper level

03:06:34.559 --> 03:06:38.799
Caption: but these are only really beneficial to

03:06:36.719 --> 03:06:40.959
Caption: helping our self-awareness if we take

03:06:38.799 --> 03:06:43.040
Caption: that time to reflect to think about how

03:06:40.959 --> 03:06:44.959
Caption: did we react in that situation how did

03:06:43.040 --> 03:06:46.719
Caption: we handle that how could what could we

03:06:44.959 --> 03:06:47.839
Caption: have done differently change those

03:06:46.719 --> 03:06:50.879
Caption: questions

03:06:47.839 --> 03:06:52.318
Caption: from why to what take those tests talk

03:06:50.879 --> 03:06:54.639
Caption: to the people around you get that

03:06:52.319 --> 03:06:56.560
Caption: feedback from your teammates as well to

03:06:54.639 --> 03:06:59.519
Caption: help build that external self-awareness

03:06:56.559 --> 03:07:02.318
Caption: and understand how you are perceived by

03:06:59.519 --> 03:07:04.639
Caption: others and those around you

03:07:02.319 --> 03:07:06.640
Caption: do you you need to work more on your

03:07:04.639 --> 03:07:08.478
Caption: mindfulness do you need to build up that

03:07:06.639 --> 03:07:10.478
Caption: emotional intelligence do you need to

03:07:08.478 --> 03:07:12.719
Caption: sort of control your emotions different

03:07:10.478 --> 03:07:15.119
Caption: situations what are you really good at

03:07:12.719 --> 03:07:18.080
Caption: maybe how do you need to alter your

03:07:15.120 --> 03:07:20.240
Caption: communication for certain team members

03:07:18.080 --> 03:07:23.679
Caption: take a step back slow down your emotions

03:07:20.240 --> 03:07:25.600
Caption: boil and practice that self-regulation

03:07:23.679 --> 03:07:27.759
Caption: so in summary we learned about

03:07:25.599 --> 03:07:29.679
Caption: leadership and that anyone can be a

03:07:27.759 --> 03:07:31.679
Caption: leader we can all build up our

03:07:29.679 --> 03:07:34.080
Caption: self-awareness and that can drive us to

03:07:31.679 --> 03:07:36.080
Caption: become better leaders and in turn our

03:07:34.080 --> 03:07:38.000
Caption: followers and our teammates those people

03:07:36.080 --> 03:07:39.839
Caption: around us are more likely to become

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:42.559
Caption: leaders as well

03:07:39.839 --> 03:07:44.240
Caption: we learned how self-awareness can be

03:07:42.559 --> 03:07:45.919
Caption: negative if we don&#39;t think about it in

03:07:44.240 --> 03:07:48.319
Caption: the right aspect

03:07:45.919 --> 03:07:50.959
Caption: so we need and we don&#39;t focus on both

03:07:48.319 --> 03:07:53.040
Caption: the internal and external so we need to

03:07:50.959 --> 03:07:55.120
Caption: to balance those two sides and practice

03:07:53.040 --> 03:07:57.599
Caption: that positive self-talk change our

03:07:55.120 --> 03:08:00.319
Caption: questions from why to what and look at

03:07:57.599 --> 03:08:01.919
Caption: how we can learn and move forward

03:08:00.319 --> 03:08:03.919
Caption: we heard how self-awareness can be

03:08:01.919 --> 03:08:06.398
Caption: beneficial to ourselves

03:08:03.919 --> 03:08:08.959
Caption: our team and our organization

03:08:06.399 --> 03:08:10.560
Caption: so through self-awareness you can be a

03:08:08.959 --> 03:08:13.759
Caption: great leader

03:08:10.559 --> 03:08:16.318

Caption: hello great talk melissa

03:08:56.240 --> 03:08:59.919
Caption: um so you mentioned failures and looking

03:08:58.240 --> 03:09:01.919
Caption: at them in a positive light do you have

03:08:59.919 --> 03:09:04.319
Caption: any recent examples of situations you&#39;ve

03:09:01.919 --> 03:09:04.319
Caption: done that

03:09:05.120 --> 03:09:11.439
Caption: so looking at things in a positive light

03:09:08.879 --> 03:09:14.319
Caption: yeah um

03:09:11.439 --> 03:09:16.880

03:09:14.319 --> 03:09:19.200
Caption: living in melbourne um in the pandemic

03:09:16.879 --> 03:09:20.319
Caption: we had you know really intense lockdowns

03:09:19.200 --> 03:09:22.799
Caption: that were

03:09:20.319 --> 03:09:24.560
Caption: you know quite difficult to to work with

03:09:22.799 --> 03:09:26.879
Caption: um and so there was a lot of negative

03:09:24.559 --> 03:09:29.519
Caption: emotions and negative things happening

03:09:26.879 --> 03:09:31.839
Caption: with um the lockdowns and it was a

03:09:29.519 --> 03:09:34.719
Caption: struggle to to manage

03:09:31.839 --> 03:09:36.959
Caption: during that scenario but on i tried to

03:09:34.719 --> 03:09:38.959
Caption: reflect on it in a positive light on the

03:09:36.959 --> 03:09:40.559
Caption: things that i was able to achieve over

03:09:38.959 --> 03:09:43.040
Caption: that time so

03:09:40.559 --> 03:09:44.559
Caption: even though you know it was a

03:09:43.040 --> 03:09:47.679
Caption: really difficult time

03:09:44.559 --> 03:09:49.519
Caption: in my life i was able to focus on things

03:09:47.679 --> 03:09:51.839
Caption: like practicing public speaking and

03:09:49.519 --> 03:09:53.919
Caption: doing virtual talks and

03:09:51.839 --> 03:09:55.519
Caption: learning more about myself and doing

03:09:53.919 --> 03:09:58.000
Caption: more of that self-reflection and

03:09:55.519 --> 03:10:01.039
Caption: everything as well so instead of

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:02.959
Caption: focusing on sort of the negative things

03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:05.599
Caption: of being stuck in your house not being

03:10:02.959 --> 03:10:07.359
Caption: able to see people i focused on the

03:10:05.599 --> 03:10:10.799
Caption: things that i was able to achieve

03:10:07.359 --> 03:10:13.359
Caption: despite um you know being in a situation

03:10:10.799 --> 03:10:15.278
Caption: even if it wasn&#39;t every day that i was

03:10:13.359 --> 03:10:16.399
Caption: able to you know be super productive

03:10:15.279 --> 03:10:17.919
Caption: there&#39;s definitely a lot of days that

03:10:16.399 --> 03:10:20.880
Caption: were spent you know just sitting on the

03:10:17.919 --> 03:10:22.398
Caption: couch being a bit miserable um focusing

03:10:20.879 --> 03:10:24.240
Caption: on the days that were positive where i

03:10:22.399 --> 03:10:27.040
Caption: was able to achieve something despite

03:10:24.240 --> 03:10:27.040
Caption: the situation

03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:39.599
Caption: i

03:10:37.040 --> 03:10:41.279
Caption: you told about one of your colleagues or

03:10:39.599 --> 03:10:43.438
Caption: one of your

03:10:41.279 --> 03:10:45.919
Caption: maybe one of your colleagues where

03:10:43.439 --> 03:10:47.359
Caption: uh your colleague was

03:10:45.919 --> 03:10:51.120
Caption: kind of

03:10:47.359 --> 03:10:54.000
Caption: more dominating in in her personality so

03:10:51.120 --> 03:10:55.839
Caption: how did you get get about it get around

03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:58.799
Caption: it because you did tell that you did

03:10:55.839 --> 03:11:01.438
Caption: some certain strategies around it but in

03:10:58.799 --> 03:11:03.278
Caption: that situation what kind of strategies

03:11:01.439 --> 03:11:05.920
Caption: did you use because that was something

03:11:03.279 --> 03:11:06.720

Caption: yeah so the the colleague was a bit more

03:11:09.599 --> 03:11:15.679
Caption: dominating and indirect whereas i&#39;m

03:11:11.919 --> 03:11:18.080
Caption: naturally um a bit more i i guess um

03:11:15.679 --> 03:11:20.318
Caption: yeah sort of less direct um in my

03:11:18.080 --> 03:11:22.240
Caption: approach to things um

03:11:20.319 --> 03:11:24.080
Caption: so i well part of it was when i was

03:11:22.240 --> 03:11:26.080
Caption: communicating with her i made sure that

03:11:24.080 --> 03:11:28.319
Caption: i i was very direct and straight to the

03:11:26.080 --> 03:11:30.240
Caption: point um so that she would understand

03:11:28.319 --> 03:11:32.720
Caption: the message that i was getting across

03:11:30.240 --> 03:11:34.879
Caption: and when it came to her communications

03:11:32.719 --> 03:11:36.398
Caption: with me i would often

03:11:34.879 --> 03:11:39.200
Caption: especially if it was something oversight

03:11:36.399 --> 03:11:41.279
Caption: email or would not do that strategy of

03:11:39.200 --> 03:11:43.200
Caption: instead of doing my initial reaction

03:11:41.279 --> 03:11:44.479
Caption: which was often take plot taken aback

03:11:43.200 --> 03:11:46.479
Caption: because

03:11:44.478 --> 03:11:48.799
Caption: because it was often quite forceful what

03:11:46.478 --> 03:11:50.478
Caption: she was saying i would just pause and

03:11:48.799 --> 03:11:52.000
Caption: think about it for a second and try to

03:11:50.478 --> 03:11:54.000
Caption: think about the message that she

03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:55.439
Caption: probably was actually trying to convey

03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:57.359
Caption: really giving her the benefit of the

03:11:55.439 --> 03:11:59.840
Caption: doubt that she probably wasn&#39;t

03:11:57.359 --> 03:12:01.919
Caption: trying to be mean or aggressive she was

03:11:59.839 --> 03:12:04.398
Caption: just trying to be direct in her message

03:12:01.919 --> 03:12:05.919
Caption: and get the information across so it&#39;s

03:12:04.399 --> 03:12:07.279
Caption: part of putting yourself in the other

03:12:05.919 --> 03:12:08.080
Caption: person&#39;s shoes

03:12:07.279 --> 03:12:10.000
Caption: and

03:12:08.080 --> 03:12:12.319
Caption: taking a step back and then also trying

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:14.080
Caption: to even replicate their ways of

03:12:12.319 --> 03:12:15.840
Caption: communicating with their actions when

03:12:14.080 --> 03:12:17.279
Caption: you&#39;re working with them so that they&#39;re

03:12:15.839 --> 03:12:19.519
Caption: more receptive

03:12:17.279 --> 03:12:21.040
Caption: to the things that you&#39;re describing

03:12:19.519 --> 03:12:22.799
Caption: and also she

03:12:21.040 --> 03:12:25.200
Caption: took the test as well so she was also

03:12:22.799 --> 03:12:26.160
Caption: more than aware of my personality and my

03:12:25.200 --> 03:12:28.240
Caption: traits

03:12:26.160 --> 03:12:29.759
Caption: which helped the way she was

03:12:28.240 --> 03:12:31.600
Caption: working with me

03:12:29.759 --> 03:12:33.519
Caption: it made it so that she was less direct

03:12:31.599 --> 03:12:35.199
Caption: because she realized that it wasn&#39;t

03:12:33.519 --> 03:12:39.478
Caption: really the the way that i like to

03:12:35.200 --> 03:12:39.479

Caption: i know you&#39;re all here to actually

04:59:25.359 --> 04:59:29.119

04:59:49.039 --> 04:59:53.599
Caption: so i&#39;m a developer advocate at github

04:59:51.119 --> 04:59:54.957
Caption: i&#39;ve come over from melbourne and yeah

04:59:53.599 --> 04:59:56.876
Caption: really exciting to be here and to talk

04:59:54.957 --> 04:59:58.318
Caption: to you all about co-pilot

04:59:56.878 --> 04:59:59.761
Caption: so today&#39;s talk we&#39;re going to be

04:59:58.320 --> 05:00:01.839
Caption: covering a couple of little things

04:59:59.759 --> 05:00:04.400
Caption: before we actually go into the co-pilot

05:00:01.839 --> 05:00:06.638
Caption: side of stuff so talk about the idea of

05:00:04.400 --> 05:00:08.160
Caption: um ai artificial intelligence what we&#39;re

05:00:06.638 --> 05:00:09.681
Caption: doing in the space

05:00:08.160 --> 05:00:11.279
Caption: obviously co-pilot is an ai we&#39;re going

05:00:09.679 --> 05:00:12.796
Caption: to get to that in a bit

05:00:11.279 --> 05:00:15.519
Caption: talk a little bit about the applications

05:00:12.798 --> 05:00:16.718
Caption: of ai and how it&#39;s relevant today

05:00:15.519 --> 05:00:18.080
Caption: then we&#39;re obviously going to talk about

05:00:16.718 --> 05:00:19.761
Caption: co-pilot

05:00:18.080 --> 05:00:21.919
Caption: and do a little bit of a demo i&#39;m going

05:00:19.759 --> 05:00:24.796
Caption: to finish off talking about this idea

05:00:21.919 --> 05:00:27.359
Caption: and this concept of ownership

05:00:24.798 --> 05:00:28.638
Caption: so first up what is ai

05:00:27.359 --> 05:00:32.160
Caption: now a lot of people here have heard

05:00:28.638 --> 05:00:33.041
Caption: about ai it&#39;s a relatively

05:00:32.160 --> 05:00:35.919
Caption: you know

05:00:33.039 --> 05:00:38.078
Caption: big part of computing and it&#39;s becoming

05:00:35.919 --> 05:00:40.320
Caption: bigger and bigger as becoming smarter

05:00:38.080 --> 05:00:42.320
Caption: and smarter as the name suggests

05:00:40.320 --> 05:00:44.240
Caption: now if you google images of ai you&#39;ll

05:00:42.320 --> 05:00:44.958
Caption: probably see this kind of stuff this you

05:00:44.240 --> 05:00:47.201
Caption: know

05:00:44.957 --> 05:00:49.839
Caption: digital interface you know that the

05:00:47.199 --> 05:00:51.679
Caption: whole iron man jarvis type stuff is is

05:00:49.839 --> 05:00:54.000
Caption: what we kind of see if we start googling

05:00:51.679 --> 05:00:55.519
Caption: but what does artificial intelligence

05:00:54.000 --> 05:00:57.199
Caption: mean what is the definition of

05:00:55.519 --> 05:01:01.039
Caption: artificial intelligence

05:00:57.199 --> 05:01:03.759
Caption: now ibm has defined it as this

05:01:01.039 --> 05:01:06.000
Caption: which is artificial intelligence

05:01:03.759 --> 05:01:07.359
Caption: leverages computers and machines

05:01:06.000 --> 05:01:09.759
Caption: to mimic the problem-solving

05:01:07.359 --> 05:01:11.199
Caption: capabilities and decision-making of

05:01:09.759 --> 05:01:14.240
Caption: people

05:01:11.199 --> 05:01:18.160
Caption: so this definition has been

05:01:14.240 --> 05:01:20.480
Caption: refined over the years originally ai um

05:01:18.160 --> 05:01:22.080
Caption: came out of like the touring project

05:01:20.480 --> 05:01:24.480
Caption: and then it&#39;s kind of moved into more

05:01:22.080 --> 05:01:26.000
Caption: about okay well now it&#39;s um you know

05:01:24.480 --> 05:01:28.798
Caption: machine learning we&#39;re all about

05:01:26.000 --> 05:01:30.798
Caption: training models but now we&#39;re getting

05:01:28.798 --> 05:01:33.281
Caption: into this more stage of artificial

05:01:30.798 --> 05:01:34.958
Caption: intelligence and back in the day when i

05:01:33.279 --> 05:01:36.318
Caption: first started doing um startups one of

05:01:34.957 --> 05:01:38.238
Caption: my first startups was actually an ai

05:01:36.320 --> 05:01:39.599
Caption: company you see a lot of ai startups and

05:01:38.240 --> 05:01:41.279
Caption: you get oh yeah we&#39;re doing artificial

05:01:39.599 --> 05:01:42.400
Caption: intelligence you&#39;re like sweet what are

05:01:41.279 --> 05:01:43.439
Caption: you doing they&#39;re like this this and

05:01:42.400 --> 05:01:45.281
Caption: this you&#39;re like

05:01:43.439 --> 05:01:47.519
Caption: yeah that&#39;s not ai that&#39;s actually

05:01:45.279 --> 05:01:49.439
Caption: machine learning so machine learning

05:01:47.519 --> 05:01:51.039
Caption: itself is training the model and

05:01:49.439 --> 05:01:53.359
Caption: teaching the things

05:01:51.039 --> 05:01:54.478
Caption: ai is now into that more decision making

05:01:53.359 --> 05:01:56.000
Caption: process

05:01:54.480 --> 05:01:58.798
Caption: what have i learnt

05:01:56.000 --> 05:01:59.839
Caption: and what can i then use to solve this

05:01:58.798 --> 05:02:02.718
Caption: problem

05:01:59.839 --> 05:02:04.320
Caption: so that&#39;s where the difference is in ai

05:02:02.718 --> 05:02:05.839
Caption: and machine learning

05:02:04.320 --> 05:02:09.121
Caption: now i think movies are a really really

05:02:05.839 --> 05:02:09.919
Caption: good way um to think about the concepts

05:02:09.119 --> 05:02:11.759
Caption: of

05:02:09.919 --> 05:02:13.519
Caption: this kind of like future tech

05:02:11.759 --> 05:02:15.039
Caption: now when we used to talk about you know

05:02:13.519 --> 05:02:16.716
Caption: what&#39;s future technology going to look

05:02:15.039 --> 05:02:18.796
Caption: like oh look at movies like back to the

05:02:16.718 --> 05:02:20.638
Caption: future and minority portal i mean i

05:02:18.798 --> 05:02:22.240
Caption: wonder when that&#39;s going to come in and

05:02:20.638 --> 05:02:23.681
Caption: literally the other day i was having a

05:02:22.240 --> 05:02:25.439
Caption: conversation with my housemate and he&#39;s

05:02:23.679 --> 05:02:27.359
Caption: like you know with all this stuff you&#39;re

05:02:25.439 --> 05:02:29.919
Caption: doing really not that far away from java

05:02:27.359 --> 05:02:32.478
Caption: so i might we&#39;re actually already here

05:02:29.919 --> 05:02:34.400
Caption: um this whole idea of java is this

05:02:32.480 --> 05:02:36.480
Caption: machine not the physical part not the

05:02:34.400 --> 05:02:38.878
Caption: ultron side of it but the original iron

05:02:36.480 --> 05:02:40.958
Caption: man side of it um you know the 19

05:02:38.878 --> 05:02:42.160
Caption: whatever movie it was now in the back in

05:02:40.957 --> 05:02:44.398
Caption: the 90s

05:02:42.160 --> 05:02:46.320
Caption: this whole idea of training this system

05:02:44.400 --> 05:02:49.361
Caption: with lots of data points and it can now

05:02:46.320 --> 05:02:51.519
Caption: tell us what to do

05:02:49.359 --> 05:02:52.957
Caption: it can give us information from all this

05:02:51.519 --> 05:02:54.636
Caption: understanding and all this stuff that

05:02:52.957 --> 05:02:57.119
Caption: we&#39;ve trained it on

05:02:54.638 --> 05:02:58.560
Caption: for example everyone saying this hey

05:02:57.119 --> 05:03:01.119
Caption: siri

05:02:58.560 --> 05:03:02.560
Caption: now when hey siri and google and alexa

05:03:01.119 --> 05:03:04.716
Caption: when they started

05:03:02.560 --> 05:03:05.679
Caption: they were kind of like glorified search

05:03:04.718 --> 05:03:07.441
Caption: engines

05:03:05.679 --> 05:03:09.679
Caption: hey siri how long is the great wall of

05:03:07.439 --> 05:03:12.876
Caption: china who&#39;s who&#39;s old enough to remember

05:03:09.679 --> 05:03:14.480
Caption: that nbn ad or the internet ad hey dad

05:03:12.878 --> 05:03:18.560
Caption: why did they build a white great wall of

05:03:14.480 --> 05:03:19.919
Caption: china oh yeah to keep rabbits out

05:03:18.560 --> 05:03:21.361
Caption: and the whole thing was like give your

05:03:19.919 --> 05:03:22.400
Caption: kids the right answer

05:03:21.359 --> 05:03:24.398
Caption: so

05:03:22.400 --> 05:03:26.798
Caption: siri when it started was this glorified

05:03:24.400 --> 05:03:28.798
Caption: search engine now it&#39;s a bit more

05:03:26.798 --> 05:03:30.320
Caption: hey you know people always say oh you

05:03:28.798 --> 05:03:31.841
Caption: know your phone&#39;s listening into you

05:03:30.320 --> 05:03:33.679
Caption: well yeah it is because it&#39;s trying to

05:03:31.839 --> 05:03:35.199
Caption: understand and learn so now it doesn&#39;t

05:03:33.679 --> 05:03:37.759
Caption: just give you information that you need

05:03:35.199 --> 05:03:40.558
Caption: to know it says oh i&#39;ve also noticed

05:03:37.759 --> 05:03:42.320
Caption: that um you played golf the other day

05:03:40.560 --> 05:03:45.919
Caption: do you need some more golf balls because

05:03:42.320 --> 05:03:45.919
Caption: you might have lost a few

05:03:46.000 --> 05:03:51.839
Caption: so another one is google nest now we see

05:03:49.039 --> 05:03:54.318
Caption: this idea of um the connected home the

05:03:51.839 --> 05:03:56.718
Caption: connected devices google nest now uses

05:03:54.320 --> 05:03:58.798
Caption: artificial intelligence to you in their

05:03:56.718 --> 05:04:01.441
Caption: cameras to see if there&#39;s intruders in

05:03:58.798 --> 05:04:03.281
Caption: your house which is i think kind of cool

05:04:01.439 --> 05:04:05.039
Caption: so it&#39;s built up an image recognition of

05:04:03.279 --> 05:04:07.839
Caption: who you are and it&#39;s now learnt who you

05:04:05.039 --> 05:04:09.199
Caption: are as a person it can now detect other

05:04:07.839 --> 05:04:10.480
Caption: people in the house and then send you a

05:04:09.199 --> 05:04:12.238
Caption: thing saying hey we think someone else

05:04:10.480 --> 05:04:13.759
Caption: is in your house based on the movement

05:04:12.240 --> 05:04:15.439
Caption: patterns of you and this other person

05:04:13.759 --> 05:04:16.796
Caption: that we don&#39;t recognize we think there&#39;s

05:04:15.439 --> 05:04:18.080
Caption: someone in your house

05:04:16.798 --> 05:04:19.761
Caption: so there comes some some of the

05:04:18.080 --> 05:04:21.919
Caption: applications there

05:04:19.759 --> 05:04:22.876
Caption: who drives a car here pretty much

05:04:21.919 --> 05:04:24.320
Caption: everyone

05:04:22.878 --> 05:04:26.080
Caption: now everyone&#39;s like when self-driving

05:04:24.320 --> 05:04:27.679
Caption: cars coming out i&#39;m like well ai and

05:04:26.080 --> 05:04:30.480
Caption: machine learning has been in cars for a

05:04:27.679 --> 05:04:32.560
Caption: while this idea of not just power assist

05:04:30.480 --> 05:04:34.320
Caption: but now i&#39;ve got driver assist you know

05:04:32.560 --> 05:04:37.121
Caption: traction controls off you know stay in

05:04:34.320 --> 05:04:38.798
Caption: the lanes get off the road or stay on

05:04:37.119 --> 05:04:41.519
Caption: the road rather

05:04:38.798 --> 05:04:43.201
Caption: this idea of driver assist right

05:04:41.519 --> 05:04:45.119
Caption: and people like oh yes i can start

05:04:43.199 --> 05:04:47.039
Caption: seeing it in our daily lives what about

05:04:45.119 --> 05:04:48.636
Caption: technology

05:04:47.039 --> 05:04:51.279
Caption: i came across this one the other day

05:04:48.638 --> 05:04:53.201
Caption: called um what was it called

05:04:51.279 --> 05:04:55.039
Caption: um i can&#39;t remember the name it hasn&#39;t

05:04:53.199 --> 05:04:58.238
Caption: put it up here but there&#39;s a there&#39;s a

05:04:55.039 --> 05:04:59.119
Caption: machine learning an ai algorithm it&#39;s in

05:04:58.240 --> 05:05:00.718
Caption: my

05:04:59.119 --> 05:05:02.318
Caption: resource at the end it actually writes

05:05:00.718 --> 05:05:03.441
Caption: articles for you

05:05:02.320 --> 05:05:04.958
Caption: so you don&#39;t even need to be a

05:05:03.439 --> 05:05:06.558
Caption: journalist anymore and outside my job at

05:05:04.957 --> 05:05:07.439
Caption: github i&#39;m a journalist and i&#39;m like oh

05:05:06.560 --> 05:05:08.240
Caption: geez

05:05:07.439 --> 05:05:10.400
Caption: um

05:05:08.240 --> 05:05:11.519
Caption: the computers are coming for my job

05:05:10.400 --> 05:05:12.798
Caption: but yeah they can they can write

05:05:11.519 --> 05:05:14.080
Caption: articles

05:05:12.798 --> 05:05:15.841
Caption: there&#39;s a really really contentious

05:05:14.080 --> 05:05:17.519
Caption: thing that popped up the other day a lot

05:05:15.839 --> 05:05:20.320
Caption: of people probably seen it

05:05:17.519 --> 05:05:22.240
Caption: this idea of artwork there&#39;s a famous us

05:05:20.320 --> 05:05:24.958
Caption: art prize that went out and it ended up

05:05:22.240 --> 05:05:27.041
Caption: going to a person who uses um used

05:05:24.957 --> 05:05:29.439
Caption: computer generated imagery to create the

05:05:27.039 --> 05:05:31.439
Caption: artwork now what i think is really cool

05:05:29.439 --> 05:05:33.359
Caption: about the artwork side of things and

05:05:31.439 --> 05:05:36.000
Caption: we&#39;re going to get to it in a little bit

05:05:33.359 --> 05:05:37.599
Caption: is the more specific

05:05:36.000 --> 05:05:39.599
Caption: you give

05:05:37.599 --> 05:05:41.599
Caption: the more parameters that you give the

05:05:39.599 --> 05:05:43.279
Caption: the engine the better artwork you&#39;re

05:05:41.599 --> 05:05:45.679
Caption: going to make and i made that one on mid

05:05:43.279 --> 05:05:47.679
Caption: journey just the other day

05:05:45.679 --> 05:05:49.199
Caption: and so if you type in some fun things

05:05:47.679 --> 05:05:50.876
Caption: you might get something back to you like

05:05:49.199 --> 05:05:54.000
Caption: oh that&#39;s a bit weird it&#39;s not the

05:05:50.878 --> 05:05:55.841
Caption: computer or the system not um like

05:05:54.000 --> 05:05:58.000
Caption: giving you something something oh it&#39;s a

05:05:55.839 --> 05:06:01.279
Caption: little bit dumb isn&#39;t it might well no

05:05:58.000 --> 05:06:02.638
Caption: you just haven&#39;t told it what you want

05:06:01.279 --> 05:06:03.759
Caption: now we&#39;re starting to see it in

05:06:02.638 --> 05:06:06.718
Caption: programming

05:06:03.759 --> 05:06:08.716
Caption: we&#39;re starting to see this idea of not

05:06:06.718 --> 05:06:11.361
Caption: just glorified search engines coming in

05:06:08.718 --> 05:06:13.761
Caption: to help you but programs that are coming

05:06:11.359 --> 05:06:15.199
Caption: in to help code

05:06:13.759 --> 05:06:16.876
Caption: and if you have a look again it&#39;s going

05:06:15.199 --> 05:06:18.558
Caption: to be um there&#39;s a link at the end of a

05:06:16.878 --> 05:06:20.320
Caption: bunch of resources

05:06:18.560 --> 05:06:22.839
Caption: there&#39;s the top 10

05:06:20.320 --> 05:06:25.121
Caption: ai pair program or ai

05:06:22.839 --> 05:06:26.796
Caption: systems plugins that you can use for vs

05:06:25.119 --> 05:06:30.000
Caption: code

05:06:26.798 --> 05:06:33.041
Caption: one of them is ali ai which helps you

05:06:30.000 --> 05:06:33.039
Caption: understand what you&#39;ve written

05:06:33.679 --> 05:06:37.119
Caption: yeah because because you need you need

05:06:35.519 --> 05:06:39.199
Caption: to know that as a developer what kind of

05:06:37.119 --> 05:06:40.398
Caption: code have i written here i actually was

05:06:39.199 --> 05:06:41.679
Caption: talking to someone the other day of

05:06:40.400 --> 05:06:42.798
Caption: dinner and they&#39;re like yeah sometimes

05:06:41.679 --> 05:06:44.716
Caption: you just don&#39;t know what you&#39;re right

05:06:42.798 --> 05:06:45.919
Caption: i&#39;m like that&#39;s where an ai pair program

05:06:44.718 --> 05:06:48.000
Caption: would help

05:06:45.919 --> 05:06:50.638
Caption: now on that list they obviously have

05:06:48.000 --> 05:06:52.798
Caption: github copilot as one of the top

05:06:50.638 --> 05:06:54.480
Caption: ai extensions that you can use in vs

05:06:52.798 --> 05:06:57.521
Caption: code

05:06:54.480 --> 05:07:00.638
Caption: so what is github copilot

05:06:57.519 --> 05:07:02.000
Caption: github copilot is your ai pair

05:07:00.638 --> 05:07:04.400
Caption: programmer

05:07:02.000 --> 05:07:07.039
Caption: this is there to help you

05:07:04.400 --> 05:07:08.160
Caption: build write and understand your code

05:07:07.039 --> 05:07:10.158
Caption: better

05:07:08.160 --> 05:07:12.480
Caption: like the other extensions in vs code

05:07:10.160 --> 05:07:14.480
Caption: it&#39;s built right into your editor

05:07:12.480 --> 05:07:16.798
Caption: and you can use it to help you write

05:07:14.480 --> 05:07:16.798
Caption: code

05:07:17.519 --> 05:07:20.716
Caption: now if we have a look at it here

05:07:19.519 --> 05:07:22.876
Caption: this is

05:07:20.718 --> 05:07:24.320
Caption: a little quick example of it

05:07:22.878 --> 05:07:26.240
Caption: it&#39;s built on

05:07:24.320 --> 05:07:27.519
Caption: the ai open codecs

05:07:26.240 --> 05:07:29.201
Caption: some of my slides are actually back to

05:07:27.519 --> 05:07:31.759
Caption: front here but it&#39;s built on the ai

05:07:29.199 --> 05:07:33.439
Caption: codex i should have used ai and copilot

05:07:31.759 --> 05:07:35.439
Caption: to write my slide deck

05:07:33.439 --> 05:07:37.519
Caption: but yeah it&#39;s built on ai codecs it&#39;s

05:07:35.439 --> 05:07:39.839
Caption: trained on billions of lines of code you

05:07:37.519 --> 05:07:42.160
Caption: can see here it&#39;s suggesting this whole

05:07:39.839 --> 05:07:45.359
Caption: function

05:07:42.160 --> 05:07:47.359
Caption: but unlike some of its um predecessors

05:07:45.359 --> 05:07:50.320
Caption: or pre-existing

05:07:47.359 --> 05:07:53.599
Caption: ai features and ai functionality

05:07:50.320 --> 05:07:55.359
Caption: it&#39;s not just auto complete

05:07:53.599 --> 05:07:57.919
Caption: it is not just saying

05:07:55.359 --> 05:07:59.519
Caption: looking at going oh hang on i think i

05:07:57.919 --> 05:08:01.359
Caption: know what you&#39;re gonna write so let me

05:07:59.519 --> 05:08:02.796
Caption: auto complete that for you we&#39;re having

05:08:01.359 --> 05:08:05.199
Caption: this conversation over dinner the other

05:08:02.798 --> 05:08:06.638
Caption: night and i was like oh isn&#39;t that the

05:08:05.199 --> 05:08:08.160
Caption: whole idea of like reducing the amount

05:08:06.638 --> 05:08:09.919
Caption: of keystrokes that you make and i was

05:08:08.160 --> 05:08:12.400
Caption: like well not really

05:08:09.919 --> 05:08:15.279
Caption: because you can either just learn a type

05:08:12.400 --> 05:08:16.878
Caption: faster or you can use shortcuts like the

05:08:15.279 --> 05:08:19.759
Caption: whole idea isn&#39;t just reducing the

05:08:16.878 --> 05:08:21.841
Caption: amount of keystrokes it should be about

05:08:19.759 --> 05:08:24.716
Caption: being better programmers and actually

05:08:21.839 --> 05:08:26.876
Caption: writing better code

05:08:24.718 --> 05:08:28.878
Caption: so that&#39;s what copilot does

05:08:26.878 --> 05:08:30.878
Caption: and it doesn&#39;t just provide you with

05:08:28.878 --> 05:08:32.798
Caption: snippets of code doesn&#39;t just say oh you

05:08:30.878 --> 05:08:34.718
Caption: know you want to write this thing here&#39;s

05:08:32.798 --> 05:08:36.400
Caption: a snippet of code and you know i&#39;m going

05:08:34.718 --> 05:08:38.240
Caption: to give you the same snippet of code and

05:08:36.400 --> 05:08:41.121
Caption: give you the same snippety code view the

05:08:38.240 --> 05:08:43.279
Caption: same snippety code no it doesn&#39;t do that

05:08:41.119 --> 05:08:46.796
Caption: it actually uses

05:08:43.279 --> 05:08:48.318
Caption: what you&#39;ve currently got in your file

05:08:46.798 --> 05:08:49.681
Caption: and what it knows about the language

05:08:48.320 --> 05:08:51.439
Caption: you&#39;re writing

05:08:49.679 --> 05:08:53.119
Caption: and uses that context when i&#39;m saying

05:08:51.439 --> 05:08:55.119
Caption: before about if the more parameters that

05:08:53.119 --> 05:08:56.558
Caption: you give it uses the context of what

05:08:55.119 --> 05:08:58.636
Caption: you&#39;re trying to do

05:08:56.560 --> 05:09:01.041
Caption: to actually synthesize code that&#39;s

05:08:58.638 --> 05:09:02.160
Caption: specific for you so if we all go use

05:09:01.039 --> 05:09:04.238
Caption: co-pilot right now we&#39;re all going to

05:09:02.160 --> 05:09:06.080
Caption: get very very different responses when

05:09:04.240 --> 05:09:08.560
Caption: we start using it which i think is

05:09:06.080 --> 05:09:08.560
Caption: really cool

05:09:08.718 --> 05:09:12.638
Caption: one of the other ways it differs from

05:09:10.560 --> 05:09:16.958
Caption: some of its pre-existing models

05:09:12.638 --> 05:09:18.798
Caption: is just the sheer scale of copilot

05:09:16.957 --> 05:09:20.158
Caption: when we work with

05:09:18.798 --> 05:09:21.601
Caption: machine learning

05:09:20.160 --> 05:09:24.798
Caption: and we&#39;re using machine learning to

05:09:21.599 --> 05:09:26.957
Caption: train artificial intelligence models

05:09:24.798 --> 05:09:29.281
Caption: one of the things that we need is lots

05:09:26.957 --> 05:09:31.839
Caption: and lots of data points

05:09:29.279 --> 05:09:34.160
Caption: have you heard of like the phrase

05:09:31.839 --> 05:09:35.519
Caption: dodgy data in dodgy data out

05:09:34.160 --> 05:09:38.480
Caption: so what we&#39;ve done is we haven&#39;t just

05:09:35.519 --> 05:09:40.957
Caption: put dodgy data into it we&#39;ve used data

05:09:38.480 --> 05:09:42.958
Caption: we&#39;ve used really good quality data to

05:09:40.957 --> 05:09:45.119
Caption: train the model but we&#39;ve also used

05:09:42.957 --> 05:09:46.000
Caption: literally billions and billions of data

05:09:45.119 --> 05:09:47.519
Caption: points

05:09:46.000 --> 05:09:49.919
Caption: lots and lots of code to train this

05:09:47.519 --> 05:09:49.919
Caption: model

05:09:50.638 --> 05:09:54.878
Caption: so it is an ai pair programmer you can

05:09:52.878 --> 05:09:56.718
Caption: sit down and code with

05:09:54.878 --> 05:09:58.320
Caption: and again our same conversation of

05:09:56.718 --> 05:10:00.000
Caption: having my housemate who isn&#39;t actually

05:09:58.320 --> 05:10:00.798
Caption: in technology he&#39;s like oh it&#39;s kind of

05:10:00.000 --> 05:10:02.400
Caption: like

05:10:00.798 --> 05:10:04.560
Caption: from why you&#39;re describing it&#39;s kind of

05:10:02.400 --> 05:10:06.240
Caption: like you sitting there

05:10:04.560 --> 05:10:07.679
Caption: writing code and it&#39;s like having a

05:10:06.240 --> 05:10:09.359
Caption: senior developer

05:10:07.679 --> 05:10:11.199
Caption: working next year and i was like well

05:10:09.359 --> 05:10:13.359
Caption: yeah but it&#39;s like having like 83

05:10:11.199 --> 05:10:14.716
Caption: million developers senior developers

05:10:13.359 --> 05:10:16.716
Caption: working next year not that everyone

05:10:14.718 --> 05:10:18.718
Caption: using github as a senior developer but

05:10:16.718 --> 05:10:21.281
Caption: you&#39;re basically using the collective

05:10:18.718 --> 05:10:23.919
Caption: knowledge of the internet

05:10:21.279 --> 05:10:25.279
Caption: to then help you write code which i

05:10:23.919 --> 05:10:27.359
Caption: think is really cool i mean that&#39;s one

05:10:25.279 --> 05:10:30.240
Caption: of the coolest things about us being

05:10:27.359 --> 05:10:32.320
Caption: able to sit down and um you know where

05:10:30.240 --> 05:10:33.759
Caption: we&#39;ve come now in history right we&#39;re

05:10:32.320 --> 05:10:35.439
Caption: able to use the collective knowledge of

05:10:33.759 --> 05:10:36.716
Caption: everyone else who came before us so why

05:10:35.439 --> 05:10:39.119
Caption: can&#39;t we use that every single day while

05:10:36.718 --> 05:10:39.121
Caption: we code

05:10:39.279 --> 05:10:42.398
Caption: and one of the things i really like

05:10:40.400 --> 05:10:44.320
Caption: about the co-pilot too is

05:10:42.400 --> 05:10:46.718
Caption: it&#39;s not really limited to any

05:10:44.320 --> 05:10:48.560
Caption: particular person

05:10:46.718 --> 05:10:50.240
Caption: right you know david did a fantastic

05:10:48.560 --> 05:10:52.160
Caption: talk before on like code spaces and

05:10:50.240 --> 05:10:53.839
Caption: actions and all those kind of cool stuff

05:10:52.160 --> 05:10:55.121
Caption: like yeah that&#39;s so cool you know but

05:10:53.839 --> 05:10:56.957
Caption: some of it when you start getting it

05:10:55.119 --> 05:10:58.636
Caption: deep i&#39;m like oh it&#39;s kind of beyond my

05:10:56.957 --> 05:11:00.957
Caption: knowledge

05:10:58.638 --> 05:11:03.281
Caption: but with co-pilot pretty much every

05:11:00.957 --> 05:11:05.439
Caption: single person can use it whether you&#39;re

05:11:03.279 --> 05:11:08.080
Caption: a developer that&#39;s just starting out or

05:11:05.439 --> 05:11:09.839
Caption: you&#39;re a senior developer working on

05:11:08.080 --> 05:11:11.279
Caption: facebook or instagram or whatever you&#39;re

05:11:09.839 --> 05:11:13.599
Caption: doing and that&#39;s what i really like

05:11:11.279 --> 05:11:13.599
Caption: about it

05:11:13.759 --> 05:11:17.439
Caption: so here&#39;s a little snippet from our

05:11:15.599 --> 05:11:20.320
Caption: website so you can see it works in

05:11:17.439 --> 05:11:22.400
Caption: multiple languages as well

05:11:20.320 --> 05:11:24.400
Caption: so we have lots of different languages

05:11:22.400 --> 05:11:26.878
Caption: you can use copilot with

05:11:24.400 --> 05:11:28.320
Caption: and you can see a little bit in a demo

05:11:26.878 --> 05:11:30.560
Caption: about the different types of ways you

05:11:28.320 --> 05:11:32.160
Caption: can use those languages

05:11:30.560 --> 05:11:34.798
Caption: and what i really like about too is it

05:11:32.160 --> 05:11:37.279
Caption: doesn&#39;t just provide you with code that

05:11:34.798 --> 05:11:39.521
Caption: it thinks you need it provides you with

05:11:37.279 --> 05:11:42.636
Caption: really really meaningful code based on

05:11:39.519 --> 05:11:42.636
Caption: the context that you&#39;ve got

05:11:42.798 --> 05:11:45.681
Caption: all right let&#39;s get into a demo there&#39;s

05:11:44.400 --> 05:11:47.361
Caption: a couple of spoilers in there so i was

05:11:45.679 --> 05:11:48.957
Caption: like let&#39;s not talk about those now

05:11:47.359 --> 05:11:50.636
Caption: let&#39;s talk about the demo

05:11:48.957 --> 05:11:53.119
Caption: right so in this demo

05:11:50.638 --> 05:11:55.121
Caption: this is pre-recorded but it&#39;s mine i did

05:11:53.119 --> 05:11:57.119
Caption: this myself like literally two days ago

05:11:55.119 --> 05:11:58.158
Caption: one of the reasons i did it pre-recorded

05:11:57.119 --> 05:12:00.080
Caption: is we don&#39;t have a lot of time we

05:11:58.160 --> 05:12:03.519
Caption: literally have like 20 minutes the

05:12:00.080 --> 05:12:05.359
Caption: second reason is because copilot learns

05:12:03.519 --> 05:12:07.039
Caption: it means that when i finish writing the

05:12:05.359 --> 05:12:08.636
Caption: code already knows i&#39;m going to write

05:12:07.039 --> 05:12:11.039
Caption: what i want so i&#39;m going to show you in

05:12:08.638 --> 05:12:13.041
Caption: a minute but basically if you haven&#39;t

05:12:11.039 --> 05:12:14.636
Caption: used github co-pilot before

05:12:13.039 --> 05:12:16.558
Caption: you need to go to

05:12:14.638 --> 05:12:17.839
Caption: the vs code extension

05:12:16.560 --> 05:12:19.919
Caption: marketplace

05:12:17.839 --> 05:12:21.599
Caption: you can grab copilot

05:12:19.919 --> 05:12:24.000
Caption: install it

05:12:21.599 --> 05:12:26.160
Caption: you log into github

05:12:24.000 --> 05:12:28.320
Caption: like use your credentials to log in

05:12:26.160 --> 05:12:30.240
Caption: and then you allow it and then you can

05:12:28.320 --> 05:12:31.519
Caption: start using copilot

05:12:30.240 --> 05:12:34.000
Caption: so you can see down the bottom there

05:12:31.519 --> 05:12:35.359
Caption: that little co-pile icon there

05:12:34.000 --> 05:12:36.560
Caption: so when we&#39;re using it this is an

05:12:35.359 --> 05:12:38.320
Caption: example

05:12:36.560 --> 05:12:41.281
Caption: that i wrote the other day

05:12:38.320 --> 05:12:42.798
Caption: i was on twilio quest trying to do one

05:12:41.279 --> 05:12:44.796
Caption: of their coding challenges and i got a

05:12:42.798 --> 05:12:46.400
Caption: little bit stuck and i was like hahaha i

05:12:44.798 --> 05:12:48.240
Caption: can use copilot

05:12:46.400 --> 05:12:50.480
Caption: and i was doing this live on a twitch

05:12:48.240 --> 05:12:53.919
Caption: stream as well so what i&#39;m providing up

05:12:50.480 --> 05:12:56.240
Caption: there is um basically the um the problem

05:12:53.919 --> 05:12:58.160
Caption: that it was asking me to solve and

05:12:56.240 --> 05:13:00.958
Caption: interestingly enough even though i wrote

05:12:58.160 --> 05:13:03.519
Caption: that out as a comment to start off with

05:13:00.957 --> 05:13:05.439
Caption: it tried to give me a function so what

05:13:03.519 --> 05:13:06.636
Caption: the problem there is basically reverse

05:13:05.439 --> 05:13:07.759
Caption: the sentence

05:13:06.638 --> 05:13:09.759
Caption: all the letters need to be

05:13:07.759 --> 05:13:11.359
Caption: non-capitalized unless it&#39;s the name of

05:13:09.759 --> 05:13:12.876
Caption: something the first letter of the word

05:13:11.359 --> 05:13:14.320
Caption: of the reverse sentence needs to be

05:13:12.878 --> 05:13:16.400
Caption: capitalized and the punctuation needs to

05:13:14.320 --> 05:13:17.599
Caption: go at the end so obviously when i wrote

05:13:16.400 --> 05:13:19.121
Caption: oh we need to reverse the sentence just

05:13:17.599 --> 05:13:20.957
Caption: give me one function it says reverse a

05:13:19.119 --> 05:13:22.558
Caption: sentence i was like okay co-pilot needs

05:13:20.957 --> 05:13:24.636
Caption: more context here

05:13:22.560 --> 05:13:26.080
Caption: so what i&#39;m writing out and this is what

05:13:24.638 --> 05:13:28.000
Caption: i did on my stream i was like all right

05:13:26.080 --> 05:13:29.919
Caption: what are the steps that i need to go

05:13:28.000 --> 05:13:31.359
Caption: through to solve this problem let&#39;s

05:13:29.919 --> 05:13:32.718
Caption: write them out in plain english each

05:13:31.359 --> 05:13:34.320
Caption: step that i need to do

05:13:32.718 --> 05:13:35.839
Caption: so i&#39;m here i&#39;m going okay first let&#39;s

05:13:34.320 --> 05:13:37.759
Caption: actually make the first letter of the

05:13:35.839 --> 05:13:39.279
Caption: sentence lower case it was not an i i

05:13:37.759 --> 05:13:42.000
Caption: had a bunch of sentences and i was like

05:13:39.279 --> 05:13:43.439
Caption: let&#39;s not not worry about like names of

05:13:42.000 --> 05:13:46.400
Caption: places let&#39;s just start a little bit

05:13:43.439 --> 05:13:48.080
Caption: basic with an iron so i was like okay

05:13:46.400 --> 05:13:49.439
Caption: um okay co-pilot let&#39;s see what you can

05:13:48.080 --> 05:13:51.279
Caption: give me and i was like all right let&#39;s

05:13:49.439 --> 05:13:53.519
Caption: um change a couple little parameters

05:13:51.279 --> 05:13:55.279
Caption: here just to make it a little bit easier

05:13:53.519 --> 05:13:56.716
Caption: to understand

05:13:55.279 --> 05:13:59.679
Caption: but

05:13:56.718 --> 05:14:01.521
Caption: by providing copilot with the context

05:13:59.679 --> 05:14:04.000
Caption: and the way that i want to solve this

05:14:01.519 --> 05:14:07.199
Caption: problem it&#39;s able to help me better than

05:14:04.000 --> 05:14:08.560
Caption: the original um snippet of code that it

05:14:07.199 --> 05:14:09.679
Caption: gave me which is reverse the sentence

05:14:08.560 --> 05:14:10.878
Caption: i&#39;m like well that&#39;s great if i just

05:14:09.679 --> 05:14:12.240
Caption: want to reverse the sentence i already

05:14:10.878 --> 05:14:14.400
Caption: knew how to do that

05:14:12.240 --> 05:14:15.919
Caption: um so let&#39;s go through these ones so i

05:14:14.400 --> 05:14:18.000
Caption: was like right next we want to split the

05:14:15.919 --> 05:14:19.199
Caption: sentence into an array of words because

05:14:18.000 --> 05:14:20.798
Caption: we actually want to reverse this

05:14:19.199 --> 05:14:22.160
Caption: sentence

05:14:20.798 --> 05:14:24.320
Caption: so it&#39;s like all right that&#39;s there and

05:14:22.160 --> 05:14:26.320
Caption: i&#39;m like oh sweet that&#39;s pretty good too

05:14:24.320 --> 05:14:28.320
Caption: and i&#39;m sitting there going tab tab tab

05:14:26.320 --> 05:14:29.919
Caption: well i&#39;m live streaming this thing

05:14:28.320 --> 05:14:32.000
Caption: which is pretty cool i was like i don&#39;t

05:14:29.919 --> 05:14:33.839
Caption: have to do anything here yeah co-pilot

05:14:32.000 --> 05:14:35.359
Caption: really is going to take my job provides

05:14:33.839 --> 05:14:36.876
Caption: these all the punctuation marks there

05:14:35.359 --> 05:14:40.320
Caption: but i was like oh no i want to make sure

05:14:36.878 --> 05:14:42.878
Caption: that um this the words yeah there you go

05:14:40.320 --> 05:14:44.638
Caption: it&#39;s pretty pretty cool hey

05:14:42.878 --> 05:14:46.160
Caption: um so yeah i was like all right now

05:14:44.638 --> 05:14:47.919
Caption: let&#39;s take out the punctuation marks

05:14:46.160 --> 05:14:49.599
Caption: from the sentence and what i want to do

05:14:47.919 --> 05:14:51.119
Caption: is i want to store them still so i can

05:14:49.599 --> 05:14:53.359
Caption: add them back in later which is why i&#39;m

05:14:51.119 --> 05:14:55.679
Caption: um adding the array there i was like

05:14:53.359 --> 05:14:57.679
Caption: right now we&#39;re going to remove them so

05:14:55.679 --> 05:14:59.599
Caption: all right there it is let&#39;s replace the

05:14:57.679 --> 05:15:02.636
Caption: punctuation marks there with um with

05:14:59.599 --> 05:15:03.919
Caption: nothing at the end um so i was like oh

05:15:02.638 --> 05:15:05.281
Caption: i&#39;m going to call it a sentence because

05:15:03.919 --> 05:15:07.359
Caption: that&#39;s going to be easy and then

05:15:05.279 --> 05:15:09.759
Caption: obviously last thing we want to do is we

05:15:07.359 --> 05:15:11.679
Caption: want to um

05:15:09.759 --> 05:15:13.519
Caption: split no obviously we&#39;ve done this now

05:15:11.679 --> 05:15:15.199
Caption: let&#39;s split the sentence reverse the

05:15:13.519 --> 05:15:17.599
Caption: sentence and come on

05:15:15.199 --> 05:15:19.599
Caption: i&#39;m typing really slow on it um let&#39;s

05:15:17.599 --> 05:15:21.679
Caption: reverse the sentence join it back

05:15:19.599 --> 05:15:23.759
Caption: together again and add the punctuation

05:15:21.679 --> 05:15:25.199
Caption: marks at the end i was like sweet um

05:15:23.759 --> 05:15:27.759
Caption: what are you gonna give me

05:15:25.199 --> 05:15:30.636
Caption: okay that&#39;s uh pretty good co-pilot

05:15:27.759 --> 05:15:32.400
Caption: um so let&#39;s let&#39;s name that there and i

05:15:30.638 --> 05:15:34.480
Caption: was like sweet

05:15:32.400 --> 05:15:36.878
Caption: i basically have

05:15:34.480 --> 05:15:39.201
Caption: most of my stuff there thanks to

05:15:36.878 --> 05:15:41.361
Caption: co-pilot um changed a couple little

05:15:39.199 --> 05:15:42.478
Caption: parameters as you can see i had a help

05:15:41.359 --> 05:15:44.080
Caption: from a

05:15:42.480 --> 05:15:46.878
Caption: developer who&#39;s a lot more senior than

05:15:44.080 --> 05:15:48.400
Caption: me um doing this on stream

05:15:46.878 --> 05:15:49.681
Caption: but yeah this was like really cool that

05:15:48.400 --> 05:15:51.519
Caption: co-pilot was able to do this now i was

05:15:49.679 --> 05:15:53.759
Caption: like finally yeah we need to add the

05:15:51.519 --> 05:15:55.119
Caption: punctuation marks back into the sentence

05:15:53.759 --> 05:15:56.957
Caption: and we need to actually join it back

05:15:55.119 --> 05:15:59.119
Caption: together so you can see here it&#39;s trying

05:15:56.957 --> 05:16:01.599
Caption: to predict what i&#39;m asked like what it

05:15:59.119 --> 05:16:03.039
Caption: wants to do but i&#39;m like providing with

05:16:01.599 --> 05:16:04.716
Caption: a little bit more context each time we

05:16:03.039 --> 05:16:07.119
Caption: can see that bang

05:16:04.718 --> 05:16:09.521
Caption: it&#39;s provided that was me i was like

05:16:07.119 --> 05:16:11.519
Caption: that&#39;s really cool

05:16:09.519 --> 05:16:12.876
Caption: again let&#39;s double check that with some

05:16:11.519 --> 05:16:15.119
Caption: code that a senior developer gave you

05:16:12.878 --> 05:16:16.160
Caption: and i was like well that&#39;s exactly what

05:16:15.119 --> 05:16:17.279
Caption: he wrote

05:16:16.160 --> 05:16:18.878
Caption: basically

05:16:17.279 --> 05:16:21.679
Caption: i think co-pilot&#39;s coming for your job

05:16:18.878 --> 05:16:24.080
Caption: mate um no just kidding but basically

05:16:21.679 --> 05:16:25.279
Caption: it&#39;s really awesome it&#39;s able to provide

05:16:24.080 --> 05:16:26.638
Caption: you with a lot of context and i&#39;m gonna

05:16:25.279 --> 05:16:28.318
Caption: give you a couple of quotes here these

05:16:26.638 --> 05:16:30.320
Caption: are straight off our website

05:16:28.320 --> 05:16:33.759
Caption: um but yeah like people are just

05:16:30.320 --> 05:16:35.201
Caption: absolutely loving um what co-pilot does

05:16:33.759 --> 05:16:36.957
Caption: so it is

05:16:35.199 --> 05:16:39.439
Caption: pretty awesome and it&#39;s like actually

05:16:36.957 --> 05:16:40.716
Caption: mind-blowing um the technology it does

05:16:39.439 --> 05:16:42.876
Caption: now as i was saying before one of the

05:16:40.718 --> 05:16:43.839
Caption: reasons why i didn&#39;t want to do this

05:16:42.878 --> 05:16:47.121
Caption: live

05:16:43.839 --> 05:16:48.796
Caption: is because when you are writing copilot

05:16:47.119 --> 05:16:50.636
Caption: and you can see there we went through

05:16:48.798 --> 05:16:52.718
Caption: all the stuff

05:16:50.638 --> 05:16:55.361
Caption: co-pilot&#39;s learning

05:16:52.718 --> 05:16:57.601
Caption: it&#39;s learning what you want it to do and

05:16:55.359 --> 05:16:59.439
Caption: for you so i was like okay what happens

05:16:57.599 --> 05:17:00.636
Caption: if i have done this live

05:16:59.439 --> 05:17:02.796
Caption: something like this probably would have

05:17:00.638 --> 05:17:04.160
Caption: happened so open up a brand new file

05:17:02.798 --> 05:17:06.080
Caption: copy and paste that same bit in there

05:17:04.160 --> 05:17:08.160
Caption: and copart goes oh yeah i think i know

05:17:06.080 --> 05:17:09.679
Caption: what you&#39;re trying to do um i reckon

05:17:08.160 --> 05:17:11.121
Caption: you&#39;re trying to reverse a sentence and

05:17:09.679 --> 05:17:12.876
Caption: bang

05:17:11.119 --> 05:17:13.919
Caption: the whole thing i was like

05:17:12.878 --> 05:17:15.681
Caption: that&#39;s what would have happened if we

05:17:13.919 --> 05:17:17.599
Caption: hadn&#39;t done this live and you wouldn&#39;t

05:17:15.679 --> 05:17:20.160
Caption: have got that cool like that you know

05:17:17.599 --> 05:17:22.796
Caption: the suspense of each part you know

05:17:20.160 --> 05:17:25.199
Caption: breaking down the uh the problem and

05:17:22.798 --> 05:17:26.878
Caption: understanding how to actually do that so

05:17:25.199 --> 05:17:28.238
Caption: um thanks for that one co-file that was

05:17:26.878 --> 05:17:30.718
Caption: really cool

05:17:28.240 --> 05:17:32.160
Caption: now people really like this and again my

05:17:30.718 --> 05:17:34.560
Caption: the time i talk isn&#39;t just using

05:17:32.160 --> 05:17:37.599
Caption: co-pilot to code it&#39;s using co-pilots

05:17:34.560 --> 05:17:40.080
Caption: actually understand and learn with your

05:17:37.599 --> 05:17:41.679
Caption: code not just it learn right

05:17:40.080 --> 05:17:43.359
Caption: so you&#39;ve launched these new things

05:17:41.679 --> 05:17:45.519
Caption: shortly after co-pilot called github

05:17:43.359 --> 05:17:47.839
Caption: co-pilot labs you get another extension

05:17:45.519 --> 05:17:48.796
Caption: so you go to the vs marketplace install

05:17:47.839 --> 05:17:50.718
Caption: that in there and then you&#39;ll see this

05:17:48.798 --> 05:17:52.958
Caption: little pop-up on the side of your vs

05:17:50.718 --> 05:17:54.878
Caption: code called co-pilot labs now what i

05:17:52.957 --> 05:17:56.876
Caption: like about co-pilot labs is it actually

05:17:54.878 --> 05:17:58.400
Caption: helps you again the same function here

05:17:56.878 --> 05:18:00.718
Caption: it actually helps you especially if

05:17:58.400 --> 05:18:02.320
Caption: you&#39;re starting learning

05:18:00.718 --> 05:18:04.798
Caption: actually helps to explain and understand

05:18:02.320 --> 05:18:06.718
Caption: your code now again someone was you know

05:18:04.798 --> 05:18:08.080
Caption: you&#39;re kind of laughing at me before you

05:18:06.718 --> 05:18:10.320
Caption: wrote the code though don&#39;t you

05:18:08.080 --> 05:18:11.839
Caption: understand it not always what happens if

05:18:10.320 --> 05:18:12.718
Caption: i opened up this in a code space or

05:18:11.839 --> 05:18:14.400
Caption: forked

05:18:12.718 --> 05:18:16.718
Caption:  um some code from someone else or

05:18:14.400 --> 05:18:18.718
Caption: cloned a repo what i can do now is i can

05:18:16.718 --> 05:18:20.240
Caption: now highlight parts of code and get

05:18:18.718 --> 05:18:21.601
Caption: co-pilot to actually explain what&#39;s

05:18:20.240 --> 05:18:24.000
Caption: going on here

05:18:21.599 --> 05:18:25.919
Caption: so copa again if i click um

05:18:24.000 --> 05:18:27.679
Caption: if i keep clicking ask it&#39;ll try and

05:18:25.919 --> 05:18:29.199
Caption: explain it in a different way kind of

05:18:27.679 --> 05:18:30.480
Caption: like a teacher it&#39;s like i didn&#39;t quite

05:18:29.199 --> 05:18:31.679
Caption: understand it first time i will try

05:18:30.480 --> 05:18:32.798
Caption: again

05:18:31.679 --> 05:18:35.039
Caption: and it gives you a bunch of different

05:18:32.798 --> 05:18:37.361
Caption: options to actually explain your code so

05:18:35.039 --> 05:18:39.279
Caption: you can explain it in plain english um

05:18:37.359 --> 05:18:40.636
Caption: yes this is a function design or you

05:18:39.279 --> 05:18:42.636
Caption: know to

05:18:40.638 --> 05:18:44.718
Caption: see if the first letter of the character

05:18:42.638 --> 05:18:46.718
Caption: in the sentence is actually an i if not

05:18:44.718 --> 05:18:49.601
Caption: then it&#39;ll change it you can actually

05:18:46.718 --> 05:18:52.000
Caption: get it to explain it in um more in-depth

05:18:49.599 --> 05:18:53.599
Caption: english or so like slightly longer and

05:18:52.000 --> 05:18:55.679
Caption: then you can also get it to explain it

05:18:53.599 --> 05:18:57.599
Caption: to you in terms of like the syntax what

05:18:55.679 --> 05:18:59.119
Caption: parts of the function being called

05:18:57.599 --> 05:19:00.876
Caption: and then finally you can actually get it

05:18:59.119 --> 05:19:04.080
Caption: to give you

05:19:00.878 --> 05:19:05.681
Caption: an example what would actually happen

05:19:04.080 --> 05:19:07.599
Caption: talked about this last night dinner as

05:19:05.679 --> 05:19:09.439
Caption: well the idea of actually translating

05:19:07.599 --> 05:19:11.119
Caption: your code this is still something we&#39;re

05:19:09.439 --> 05:19:12.716
Caption: working on so it&#39;s not perfect but you

05:19:11.119 --> 05:19:14.238
Caption: can actually translate your code into

05:19:12.718 --> 05:19:16.638
Caption: other languages so if you&#39;re a python

05:19:14.240 --> 05:19:19.439
Caption: developer and just wanting to learn um

05:19:16.638 --> 05:19:21.281
Caption: something else like ruby php whatever

05:19:19.439 --> 05:19:22.796
Caption: you can now get it to

05:19:21.279 --> 05:19:24.160
Caption: try and help you translate your code now

05:19:22.798 --> 05:19:25.201
Caption: obviously it&#39;s not perfect you can see a

05:19:24.160 --> 05:19:27.439
Caption: couple of you&#39;re snickering there in the

05:19:25.199 --> 05:19:29.279
Caption: corner it&#39;s not perfect it&#39;s not um it&#39;s

05:19:27.439 --> 05:19:31.759
Caption: not great we&#39;re getting there um but

05:19:29.279 --> 05:19:32.636
Caption: yeah have a look at that um

05:19:31.759 --> 05:19:34.716
Caption: so

05:19:32.638 --> 05:19:37.281
Caption: somebody asked me the other day i&#39;m

05:19:34.718 --> 05:19:40.320
Caption: nearly wrapping up but what happens if i

05:19:37.279 --> 05:19:42.558
Caption: actually don&#39;t want copilot to use the

05:19:40.320 --> 05:19:45.201
Caption: stuff that i&#39;ve got to learn

05:19:42.560 --> 05:19:47.201
Caption: what if also it doesn&#39;t does co-pilot

05:19:45.199 --> 05:19:48.080
Caption: ever actually give us the same

05:19:47.199 --> 05:19:49.599
Caption: um

05:19:48.080 --> 05:19:51.119
Caption: piece of code

05:19:49.599 --> 05:19:52.876
Caption: because it&#39;s still a relatively new

05:19:51.119 --> 05:19:55.519
Caption: model and you know what we&#39;re still

05:19:52.878 --> 05:19:57.601
Caption: doing we&#39;re still learning

05:19:55.519 --> 05:20:00.160
Caption: you can actually

05:19:57.599 --> 05:20:01.759
Caption: get copilot to filter out some of the

05:20:00.160 --> 05:20:04.320
Caption: things that it can tell you

05:20:01.759 --> 05:20:06.480
Caption: so in most cases the code that copart

05:20:04.320 --> 05:20:08.718
Caption: gives you is specific to you it&#39;s been

05:20:06.480 --> 05:20:10.320
Caption: synthesized just for you

05:20:08.718 --> 05:20:12.000
Caption: in less than one percent of the cases

05:20:10.320 --> 05:20:13.679
Caption: however you might get code that is

05:20:12.000 --> 05:20:15.919
Caption: similar to something that is already in

05:20:13.679 --> 05:20:17.759
Caption: an open source repository so you can

05:20:15.919 --> 05:20:20.000
Caption: turn off the filter in your co-pilot

05:20:17.759 --> 05:20:22.240
Caption: settings on github and say actually

05:20:20.000 --> 05:20:24.878
Caption: block these suggestions so if there&#39;s a

05:20:22.240 --> 05:20:26.240
Caption: snippet of code that&#39;s even you know 100

05:20:24.878 --> 05:20:28.400
Caption: characters i can&#39;t remember exactly what

05:20:26.240 --> 05:20:29.679
Caption: it is but about 100 characters similar

05:20:28.400 --> 05:20:31.519
Caption: to another piece of code that&#39;s on the

05:20:29.679 --> 05:20:33.199
Caption: internet don&#39;t show it to me

05:20:31.519 --> 05:20:33.919
Caption: then under that you also saw there was

05:20:33.199 --> 05:20:37.359
Caption: that

05:20:33.919 --> 05:20:39.359
Caption: option to say do not use my code

05:20:37.359 --> 05:20:40.716
Caption: for improving github&#39;s products so your

05:20:39.359 --> 05:20:42.320
Caption: code won&#39;t be used

05:20:40.718 --> 05:20:45.681
Caption: if you like copilot head over to the

05:20:42.320 --> 05:20:47.679
Caption: co-pilot website copilot.kdob.com

05:20:45.679 --> 05:20:50.796
Caption: and try it out

05:20:47.679 --> 05:20:54.000
Caption: it is free for 60 days for anyone to try

05:20:50.798 --> 05:20:56.320
Caption: otherwise i think it says 120 dollars

05:20:54.000 --> 05:20:57.679
Caption: for the year something like that

05:20:56.320 --> 05:20:58.798
Caption: 10 a month

05:20:57.679 --> 05:21:00.716
Caption: and then

05:20:58.798 --> 05:21:02.480
Caption: and 100 for a year so you get you know

05:21:00.718 --> 05:21:03.441
Caption: two months free if you sign up for the

05:21:02.480 --> 05:21:05.041
Caption: whole year

05:21:03.439 --> 05:21:06.957
Caption: teachers i just found out if you&#39;re a

05:21:05.039 --> 05:21:09.279
Caption: teacher you now get co-part for free as

05:21:06.957 --> 05:21:11.199
Caption: part of the um campus program the github

05:21:09.279 --> 05:21:13.039
Caption: global campus program it&#39;s a teacher you

05:21:11.199 --> 05:21:15.039
Caption: get it for free

05:21:13.039 --> 05:21:17.039
Caption: and obviously open source developers um

05:21:15.039 --> 05:21:19.039
Caption: you get that um for free as well working

05:21:17.039 --> 05:21:20.957
Caption: on a big open source project now finally

05:21:19.039 --> 05:21:22.238
Caption: i know where um at time but finally i

05:21:20.957 --> 05:21:23.919
Caption: really want to touch on this point of

05:21:22.240 --> 05:21:24.798
Caption: ownership because it comes up all the

05:21:23.919 --> 05:21:25.599
Caption: time

05:21:24.798 --> 05:21:27.281
Caption: um

05:21:25.599 --> 05:21:28.636
Caption: regardless of whether it&#39;s the articles

05:21:27.279 --> 05:21:31.039
Caption: that we&#39;re talking about before the

05:21:28.638 --> 05:21:33.281
Caption: artwork um here with program people like

05:21:31.039 --> 05:21:35.839
Caption: what happens with you know ai like

05:21:33.279 --> 05:21:37.519
Caption: ownership who owns the thing do i own it

05:21:35.839 --> 05:21:39.279
Caption: because i you know built the artwork

05:21:37.519 --> 05:21:41.199
Caption: does the program own it because they&#39;re

05:21:39.279 --> 05:21:42.636
Caption: the ones who built the ai does the open

05:21:41.199 --> 05:21:43.919
Caption: ai own it

05:21:42.638 --> 05:21:45.919
Caption: most of the time we&#39;ve come to the

05:21:43.919 --> 05:21:47.679
Caption: conclusion that nearly all these things

05:21:45.919 --> 05:21:50.400
Caption: they they allow the people who actually

05:21:47.679 --> 05:21:53.119
Caption: create it to have the ownership and it&#39;s

05:21:50.400 --> 05:21:55.121
Caption: exactly the same with co-pilot so the

05:21:53.119 --> 05:21:57.839
Caption: code that you write with co-pilot is

05:21:55.119 --> 05:21:59.919
Caption: your code nobody else owns it we don&#39;t

05:21:57.839 --> 05:22:01.119
Caption: own it you own it someone to finish on

05:21:59.919 --> 05:22:02.957
Caption: that

05:22:01.119 --> 05:22:04.558
Caption: finally again there&#39;s a gist up there

05:22:02.957 --> 05:22:06.318
Caption: for all the resources links to

05:22:04.560 --> 05:22:08.160
Caption: everything um

05:22:06.320 --> 05:22:09.439
Caption: that i spoke about

05:22:08.160 --> 05:22:10.320
Caption: if you do have questions because

05:22:09.439 --> 05:22:12.080
Caption: obviously you don&#39;t have time for

05:22:10.320 --> 05:22:14.160
