00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.739
Caption: how&#39;s everyone going decided anything

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:13.510
Caption: [Music]

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:15.100
Caption: first up this morning we have stopped

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.760
Caption: Percival&#39;s talking about the best

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.350
Caption: engineering is with the is good and bull

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.350
Caption: so for everyone so

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.819
Caption: [Applause]

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:54.039
Caption: and welcome to today s engineering

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:12.049
Caption: inexperience but hopefully appreciate it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.208
Caption: it&#39;s a very difficult few down so

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.140
Caption: actually you guys ever you guys sorry

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:27.379
Caption: you&#39;ll get a special challenge today

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:29.599
Caption: these techniques go on I just wanted to

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:31.879
Caption: thank all the amazing sponsors and

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:33.529
Caption: probably all the stuff behind the scenes

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:36.228
Caption: got you know guiding people around

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:38.929
Caption: working AV here until you post 2018

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:41.389
Caption: today it&#39;s amazing privilege to be here

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.910
Caption: to speak to all today and possible

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:50.410
Caption: without everyone in this room also a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.410
Caption: pioneer oh sorry let&#39;s go

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:02.169
Caption: yeah

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.588
Caption: [Music]

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.480
Caption: but any piece of software I will just

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.139
Caption: try and take it apart and see how far I

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:45.250
Caption: got

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:46.720
Caption: and I failed a lot of times during this

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.850
Caption: day there&#39;s nothing more frustrating

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.470
Caption: right that knowing you are doing the

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.500
Caption: wrong thing we&#39;re just going to have to

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.300
Caption: write like search query or the right

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.919
Caption: question to ask in order to actually get

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.339
Caption: back on the right track so yeah that was

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.130
Caption: us

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:05.619
Caption: after waddle after after you go around

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.730
Caption: the block I started my peak a few small

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:08.649
Caption: victories here in the man managed to

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.129
Caption: slowly kind of piece of keep things

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:11.229
Caption: together

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.940
Caption: more importantly I can start to see that

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:14.019
Caption: for all of these all of these reverse

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.029
Caption: engineering techniques though these

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.100
Caption: invisible kind of threads that were

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:20.470
Caption: connecting all the ones of the same type

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.570
Caption: and in fact like full really content

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.860
Caption: sheets the ones o I just kind of wrote

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.290
Caption: it off as bait all these deduce flight

00:04:23.859 --> 00:04:28.389
Caption: weight out of my league there&#39;s actually

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.339
Caption: two or three steps for them is an easier

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:36.180
Caption: version of that same technique and by

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:36.179
Caption: practicing the skills and the transfer

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.279
Caption: it&#39;s very strange because rather stage

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:53.169
Caption: now where there&#39;s I guess so much

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:55.000
Caption: quality material especially in the form

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.649
Caption: of layups videos getting started rolls

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.600
Caption: and it all seems to be just kind of

00:04:56.649 --> 00:05:01.109
Caption: focused on like the view from the top of

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.110
Caption: the mountain

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.900
Caption: so basically yeah as I said we&#39;re just

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.760
Caption: gonna talk about a little sitcom today

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:10.559
Caption: and hopefully with luck they&#39;ll just

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.100
Caption: give you the foothold you need to get

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:15.959
Caption: started so very good tool that could

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.480
Caption: begin with the definition for most

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:21.709
Caption: engineering it is a discipline that is

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.710
Caption: focused around gaining an understanding

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.240
Caption: that&#39;s pretty much it so we&#39;re talking

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.859
Caption: about say today obviously but when we

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:31.829
Caption: say system could be neat if we could

00:05:28.859 --> 00:05:34.889
Caption: mean a secret pocket ship we could mean

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:36.449
Caption: a the kind of process could mean ice

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.070
Caption: cream play bug but all of these things

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.860
Caption: reverse engineer pretty much anything

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.110
Caption: man right and when we were posted to

00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:44.669
Caption: doing it&#39;s important to have a doll you

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:47.119
Caption: don&#39;t the other thing it&#39;s up to you but

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.860
Caption: it&#39;s nice to have a goal so we know that

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:52.679
Caption: trying to get out of this experience and

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:54.659
Caption: a very common goal some people just

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:55.769
Caption: extract some information in the systems

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.040
Caption: sometimes you just feel like an

00:05:55.769 --> 00:06:00.929
Caption: accretion cave or a DVD player or some

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.210
Caption: essence from a game just just getting

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:05.190
Caption: some information out other times you

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:07.380
Caption: might be doing some reverse engineering

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.299
Caption: components who trades or can improve on

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.429
Caption: a design you can make at the moment

00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:14.009
Caption: that&#39;s really important especially if

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:15.899
Caption: you are trying to for instance credit

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.440
Caption: Oakland replacement for existing system

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:26.269
Caption: say like you know Lionel samih replacing

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.269
Caption: windows services I&#39;m also the emulated

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.778
Caption: [Music]

00:06:49.070 --> 00:07:02.070
Caption: now I&#39;m not gonna pull the trap of

00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:05.730
Caption: saying because challenging it is quite

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:09.059
Caption: challenging after let&#39;s kind of is

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:12.120
Caption: interesting it doesn&#39;t have to be is

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:15.149
Caption: impossible things I figured off too like

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:18.149
Caption: a select few people and unfortunately

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:19.589
Caption: like the longest time like as for us as

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:21.079
Caption: far as talking the world goes there&#39;s

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:23.579
Caption: been this kind of stagnant elitism

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:25.739
Caption: around the into my food over both

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:28.139
Caption: engineering and it suits me a little bit

00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:31.489
Caption: so this is probably a good time to step

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.490
Caption: out some cancerous myths

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:37.350
Caption: loose it out loud talk about gates so

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:40.430
Caption: it&#39;s more just background noise it&#39;s the

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.429
Caption: idea that it is somehow

00:07:40.500 --> 00:08:46.619
Caption: now somewhere that&#39;s probably gonna be I

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:51.010
Caption: guess platform documentation the API

00:08:46.619 --> 00:08:54.309
Caption: console where you need to go to find

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:55.270
Caption: information everything else you can just

00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:56.559
Caption: learn as you go

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.420
Caption: in fact it&#39;s probably gonna be quicker

00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:01.239
Caption: than pre-loaded pre learning and in

00:08:58.419 --> 00:09:07.320
Caption: front of dredger dollar another one that

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:11.289
Caption: comes up is also important to know EC is

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:15.039
Caption: not true there is an overlap between I

00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:17.309
Caption: guess knowledge of how C works cqx keys

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:17.309
Caption: code

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.049
Caption: [Music]

00:10:02.929 --> 00:10:08.768
Caption: [Music]

00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:22.029
Caption: and then finally like the Nauru Scotsman

00:10:19.659 --> 00:10:23.799
Caption: fallacy the idea that it doesn&#39;t count

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:28.030
Caption: as regressive during unless it meets

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:30.820
Caption: some kind of ridiculous level of

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:33.040
Caption: planning groups that jump through and a

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:35.380
Caption: common one is that it just if someone

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:39.479
Caption: has a below done reverse engineering in

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:39.479
Caption: an area before doesn&#39;t

00:10:42.898 --> 00:10:49.438
Caption: works usually there&#39;s more than one

00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:50.938
Caption: person in succession and finally this is

00:10:49.439 --> 00:10:52.920
Caption: a lot of kind of jumps with my pain

00:10:50.939 --> 00:10:54.329
Caption: neurons the hottest Emily

00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:57.179
Caption: reverse-engineering if it looks

00:10:54.328 --> 00:10:59.698
Caption: sufficiently thankful and complex and

00:10:57.179 --> 00:11:01.948
Caption: this one gets trafficked around so much

00:10:59.698 --> 00:11:03.958
Caption: that I hate it because this is like this

00:11:01.948 --> 00:11:07.588
Caption: is the root of why this started

00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:08.878
Caption: exclusionary and self reinforcing or if

00:11:07.588 --> 00:11:26.219
Caption: you are using reverse engineering

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:27.629
Caption: techniques so just very quickly talk

00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:29.338
Caption: about three different categories of

00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:32.660
Caption: technique there are three rough

00:11:29.338 --> 00:11:35.369
Caption: categories you can fit every engineering

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:36.898
Caption: the three would be is blackbox analysis

00:11:35.369 --> 00:11:38.670
Caption: which is basically just like messing

00:11:36.898 --> 00:11:40.979
Caption: with the inputs and outputs that go into

00:11:38.669 --> 00:11:42.748
Caption: a piece of software there&#39;s dynamic

00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:44.669
Caption: analysis which is like sticking probes

00:11:42.749 --> 00:11:46.379
Caption: into a piece of software as it runs to

00:11:44.669 --> 00:11:48.628
Caption: figure out exactly what it&#39;s doing and

00:11:46.379 --> 00:11:50.490
Caption: the state can also just kind of explain

00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:52.470
Caption: the software out over on the table and

00:11:50.489 --> 00:11:54.898
Caption: you try and just infer things from just

00:11:52.469 --> 00:11:55.979
Caption: remaining what you have and it&#39;s always

00:11:54.898 --> 00:11:58.938
Caption: going to have these two of these

00:11:55.979 --> 00:12:01.078
Caption: approaches handy because generally

00:11:58.939 --> 00:12:02.639
Caption: sometimes you might have all three if

00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:04.409
Caption: you have all three that&#39;s brilliant but

00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:06.328
Caption: a princess the moment I&#39;m trying to

00:12:04.409 --> 00:12:08.428
Caption: disassemble this boomer on this whole

00:12:06.328 --> 00:12:10.739
Caption: synthesize that I have and the CPU

00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:13.480
Caption: doesn&#39;t have goofy demos or come to

00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:16.059
Caption: dynamic but I can&#39;t do the other two

00:12:13.479 --> 00:12:19.149
Caption: just say and then I can change in

00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:20.890
Caption: Florida which is Popoff&#39;s so if you have

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.740
Caption: less than two you and I have a difficult

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:27.220
Caption: time but at least two you&#39;re fine

00:12:23.739 --> 00:12:28.570
Caption: now how am I gonna just get a show of

00:12:27.219 --> 00:12:35.889
Caption: hands how many people would have done

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:43.390
Caption: something that was engineering how many

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:44.770
Caption: people specifically County people open

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.980
Caption: the network seven what&#39;s the traffic

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:49.929
Caption: coming in house sick all right you guys

00:12:47.979 --> 00:12:52.599
Caption: sorry you&#39;ve all done black post

00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:55.330
Caption: engineering you&#39;ve done my post analysis

00:12:52.599 --> 00:12:59.250
Caption: right here I love the depth is this get

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.250
Caption: all three you get a post analysis

00:13:00.809 --> 00:13:08.080
Caption: analysis inspector let&#39;s not focus on

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:09.640
Caption: that let&#39;s keep going all right sorry

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:13.000
Caption: today I&#39;m gonna try a couple three

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:15.429
Caption: fairly complicated techniques one from

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.900
Caption: each of the categories this is it&#39;s

00:13:15.429 --> 00:13:18.940
Caption: gonna be strongly the defense bit

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.710
Caption: between the accessible and the technical

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.869
Caption: so if I&#39;m going too far off the deep end

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.130
Caption: please enter the opera&#39;s this is the

00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:26.559
Caption: first time I&#39;ve been kind of trying to

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:29.979
Caption: teach in this capacity before so it&#39;s

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:31.719
Caption: the only way that online so the first

00:13:29.979 --> 00:13:34.089
Caption: few like I&#39;m gonna talk about today is

00:13:31.719 --> 00:13:37.329
Caption: something angel user one that&#39;s reading

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.320
Caption: mystery data now data comes from all

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.420
Caption: sorts of places when you reverse

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.760
Caption: engineer it can come from files it can

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:44.979
Caption: come from memory dumps become attractive

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:52.239
Caption: we know and love like simple PNG or JSON

00:13:49.349 --> 00:13:54.849
Caption: but usually we have to melt that lucky

00:13:52.239 --> 00:13:55.359
Caption: and it just turns out to be just some

00:13:54.849 --> 00:13:57.398
Caption: blow

00:13:55.359 --> 00:13:59.828
Caption: so mr. Lowe we don&#39;t know a minute sorry

00:13:57.398 --> 00:14:02.559
Caption: the question is how do we find out what

00:13:59.828 --> 00:14:10.289
Caption: is in this mysterious mysterious balls

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:13.750
Caption: the answer is to go down a level sorry

00:14:10.289 --> 00:14:15.789
Caption: Donovan boy spot is made up of lots of -

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:19.000
Caption: basically just you think of it as like a

00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:24.250
Caption: single number between 0 and 255 or 8

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.778
Caption: bits or 0 0 2 FF in hexadecimal and 256

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.698
Caption: choices that&#39;s very small so I

00:14:25.778 --> 00:14:29.919
Caption: thankfully there are a number of I guess

00:14:27.698 --> 00:14:31.539
Caption: expanded ways of representing like

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:33.969
Caption: bigger things such as a lot of numbers

00:14:31.539 --> 00:14:35.799
Caption: or Springs using the statements of box

00:14:33.969 --> 00:14:38.289
Caption: and those are the contacts and codes so

00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:39.518
Caption: there are a bunch of examples that or

00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:43.659
Caption: some of the more popular ways of

00:14:39.518 --> 00:14:47.109
Caption: encoding things advice you know two&#39;s

00:14:43.659 --> 00:14:50.409
Caption: complement or negative integers in these

00:14:47.109 --> 00:14:56.198
Caption: and such and of course we need some

00:14:50.409 --> 00:14:59.969
Caption: tools to help us doing this kind of

00:14:56.198 --> 00:15:02.440
Caption: thing is a hex editor now hexa to this

00:14:59.969 --> 00:15:04.148
Caption: awful early reviews the hex editor at

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.979
Caption: some point if you&#39;re from a building

00:15:04.148 --> 00:15:07.570
Caption: background the basics like text editors

00:15:05.979 --> 00:15:09.820
Caption: but they just have this nice Big Bang is

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:12.578
Caption: showing you what the clock lab is inside

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.289
Caption: you always require they are amazing for

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:16.570
Caption: black box analysis you can do things

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:19.289
Caption: like any of them like get a program to

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:22.479
Caption: say 12 anything&#39;s and see how it reacts

00:15:19.289 --> 00:15:25.139
Caption: maybe save before an opera change and

00:15:22.479 --> 00:15:28.260
Caption: then trying to like command

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:29.398
Caption: is a difference and there were a lot of

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:31.739
Caption: pics tools out there and unfortunately

00:15:29.398 --> 00:15:32.398
Caption: this very easy answer for which one is

00:15:31.739 --> 00:15:34.979
Caption: the best

00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:37.409
Caption: I must try them all eventually I will

00:15:34.979 --> 00:15:39.898
Caption: find one that speaks to you and use that

00:15:37.409 --> 00:15:46.440
Caption: I can make one piece of ice try and see

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:49.109
Caption: the dust statistics now for the

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:52.409
Caption: shameless plug part of the talk I really

00:15:49.109 --> 00:15:54.510
Caption: quite like taking up complements and in

00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:58.828
Caption: fact I was doing so long I got sick and

00:15:54.510 --> 00:16:02.429
Caption: tired I made myself a library it is cool

00:15:58.828 --> 00:16:05.208
Caption: a snooker table is a framework and the

00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:08.099
Caption: idea basically there from binary file to

00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:10.320
Caption: structure my motives to not get in you

00:16:08.099 --> 00:16:11.849
Caption: know as few lines of code as possible so

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.350
Caption: and it also contains some cool

00:16:11.849 --> 00:16:15.389
Caption: visualization tools which we&#39;re going to

00:16:13.349 --> 00:16:17.398
Caption: be using in the next few slides just to

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.720
Caption: demo some stuff sorry if that thing

00:16:17.398 --> 00:16:20.760
Caption: comes things sounds like gonna be either

00:16:18.719 --> 00:16:24.359
Caption: speak to you at all by all means I urge

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:26.190
Caption: you to check it out alright so I think

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:28.049
Caption: it would be good at this point just kind

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:30.708
Caption: of short like a few examples of things

00:16:28.049 --> 00:16:30.708
Caption: you can find

00:16:34.458 --> 00:16:41.698
Caption: now we&#39;re talking before I thought I

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:43.828
Caption: guess standing files are useful because

00:16:41.698 --> 00:16:45.838
Caption: in the stem initiative at not to use a

00:16:43.828 --> 00:16:48.630
Caption: standard Bob it was this is another

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:51.359
Caption: point reinvent the wheel design my image

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:53.929
Caption: just there&#39;s a whole bunch of blog razor

00:16:51.359 --> 00:16:57.778
Caption: to open game to you I&#39;m afraid

00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:58.869
Caption: bus at the same time companies really

00:16:57.778 --> 00:17:01.390
Caption: just trust my message

00:16:58.869 --> 00:17:03.640
Caption: trustus at the slide circuit if they use

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:07.140
Caption: a standard format sometimes they&#39;ll hide

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:10.290
Caption: it in something else but thankfully

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:13.989
Caption: worthless ID so we can dig little deeper

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:19.660
Caption: so is a random selection of standard

00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:22.300
Caption: walls and all of them can be identified

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.280
Caption: by a magic number so I&#39;ll just come up

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.800
Caption: here a magic number is messages like

00:17:24.280 --> 00:18:07.719
Caption: small sequences of bytes that happen

00:17:26.800 --> 00:18:09.100
Caption: usually indicates is and this is the

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:10.959
Caption: Bristol bar you can see there&#39;s

00:18:09.099 --> 00:18:14.049
Caption: definitely like a big pattern going

00:18:10.959 --> 00:18:16.719
Caption: along here you can see like these large

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:19.540
Caption: Rosa it seems like cruising all right be

00:18:16.719 --> 00:18:20.739
Caption: proof support and in text that&#39;s pretty

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.780
Caption: much what they are these are all kind of

00:18:20.739 --> 00:18:25.209
Caption: these are these who&#39;ve been introduced

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.729
Caption: so four bytes is representing one number

00:18:25.209 --> 00:18:30.719
Caption: and normally don&#39;t be like enough of the

00:18:27.729 --> 00:18:45.250
Caption: discovery of the fact that this is just

00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:52.789
Caption: actually the numbers 353 in fact there

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:57.859
Caption: are 353 list entries after that oh sorry

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:59.869
Caption: we see here but they are going up in

00:18:57.859 --> 00:19:01.969
Caption: size and they are less than the total

00:18:59.869 --> 00:19:04.459
Caption: size of the file which is a game archive

00:19:01.969 --> 00:19:05.929
Caption: sorry that could be that could be those

00:19:04.459 --> 00:19:08.089
Caption: significance people were to pick one of

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:12.160
Caption: these and then jumps with a spot of the

00:19:08.089 --> 00:19:12.159
Caption: file which corresponds to the number

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:17.930
Caption: clearly like some game data that they

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:21.050
Caption: didn&#39;t want us to see and then and you

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:22.160
Caption: know just to talk about the next group

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:26.600
Caption: there&#39;s another group before actually

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:28.280
Caption: the breasts are the sizes and so you

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:31.010
Caption: would see this exact kind of lab but

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.390
Caption: it&#39;s a good example of I guess it&#39;s used

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.130
Caption: quite a lot especially in situations

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.530
Caption: where you don&#39;t have very much memory

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.810
Caption: because this is very cheap and it easy

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:41.180
Caption: for the CPU to kind of like to load of

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.830
Caption: days just straight from the disk and

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.630
Caption: iterating through them and it&#39;s also

00:19:42.829 --> 00:19:45.890
Caption: pretty lazy bug prevention relax and

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:48.859
Caption: programmers love these because there&#39;s

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:52.239
Caption: no validation is jump ms around the

00:19:48.859 --> 00:19:55.369
Caption: bottle using things but yes

00:19:52.239 --> 00:19:56.869
Caption: this is this is normal of one general

00:19:55.369 --> 00:19:58.309
Caption: thumb is if you see something in the

00:19:56.869 --> 00:20:03.050
Caption: heck stuff that looks sort of like a

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:04.970
Caption: picture it probably actually is as we

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.500
Caption: said before that&#39;s like basically you

00:20:04.969 --> 00:20:09.349
Caption: know we would be matching the standard

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.030
Caption: ball or damaged bus at the same time and

00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:13.549
Caption: take a look there are real pain to

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.680
Caption: actually use so much you just want a

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.900
Caption: graphic right and this here is an

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.030
Caption: example about the 256 colors so

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.849
Caption: everybody is one pixel

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:25.570
Caption: there&#39;s a high speed in somewhere else

00:20:22.849 --> 00:20:25.569
Caption: inside

00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:35.528
Caption: [Music]

00:20:43.469 --> 00:20:46.640
Caption: [Music]

00:20:55.750 --> 00:21:17.390
Caption: so that&#39;s like a really interesting

00:21:15.048 --> 00:21:19.819
Caption: property I guess over because it&#39;s like

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:23.000
Caption: a wave and it&#39;s always kind of going up

00:21:19.819 --> 00:21:25.219
Caption: and above the origin points of the sound

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.900
Caption: wave it means these really nice

00:21:25.219 --> 00:21:30.380
Caption: symmetrical distributions and it works

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:32.589
Caption: but but for pretty much any type of any

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:35.900
Caption: number that you put into that so you see

00:21:32.589 --> 00:21:36.529
Caption: something we&#39;ve made this is basic mr.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.410
Caption: Graham I&#39;m sorry

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:40.940
Caption: video impetus but one pole what every

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.340
Caption: single violence is counting the number

00:21:40.939 --> 00:21:47.269
Caption: of H so if you have a histogram looks

00:21:43.339 --> 00:21:48.469
Caption: perfectly symmetrical and in fact I was

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:50.000
Caption: procrastinating with rather than as well

00:21:48.469 --> 00:21:51.439
Caption: so actually made another school

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.900
Caption: I really like the histogram so I made

00:21:51.439 --> 00:21:55.548
Caption: another tool which would just go through

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.349
Caption: fall slice it up and give you a

00:21:55.548 --> 00:21:59.178
Caption: histogram that each line that was

00:21:57.349 --> 00:22:01.339
Caption: actually I quite enjoy this because you

00:21:59.178 --> 00:22:01.969
Caption: can from this you can actually kind of

00:22:01.339 --> 00:22:03.619
Caption: make

00:22:01.969 --> 00:22:06.379
Caption: what&#39;s in the file without actually

00:22:03.619 --> 00:22:07.879
Caption: seeing anything it like for instance and

00:22:06.379 --> 00:22:10.669
Caption: the bridge hope you see there&#39;s a nice

00:22:07.879 --> 00:22:12.919
Caption: big square in the second quadrant of the

00:22:10.668 --> 00:22:14.599
Caption: top line and that happens to be sitting

00:22:12.918 --> 00:22:16.638
Caption: cauldron happens to be mobile the

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:19.668
Caption: esqueleto zealots are all the alphabet

00:22:16.639 --> 00:22:22.639
Caption: characters and balloon oh yes its ASCII

00:22:19.668 --> 00:22:26.829
Caption: text to that area underneath that kind

00:22:22.639 --> 00:22:30.289
Caption: of tapestry monstrosity underneath

00:22:26.829 --> 00:22:31.969
Caption: that&#39;s actually x86 courage this game is

00:22:30.288 --> 00:22:34.038
Caption: pretty always fun with sound rise with

00:22:31.969 --> 00:22:35.359
Caption: it basically but you can tell that it&#39;s

00:22:34.038 --> 00:22:37.548
Caption: kind of toy because it&#39;s not only

00:22:35.359 --> 00:22:38.989
Caption: depressed and let these long things I&#39;d

00:22:37.548 --> 00:22:43.750
Caption: like to instructions which are the most

00:22:38.989 --> 00:22:45.219
Caption: popular now underneath that we

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:48.288
Caption: [Music]

00:22:45.219 --> 00:22:50.719
Caption: compressed kind of just to go back and

00:22:48.288 --> 00:22:53.418
Caption: kind of see that it&#39;s not fully solo

00:22:50.719 --> 00:22:55.308
Caption: reasons compressed well so it&#39;s been

00:22:53.418 --> 00:22:57.678
Caption: personally badly you can still make out

00:22:55.308 --> 00:22:59.119
Caption: some detail but at school there&#39;s no

00:22:57.678 --> 00:23:01.308
Caption: black areas which means that he is

00:22:59.119 --> 00:23:03.500
Caption: compressed to some degree and then a

00:23:01.308 --> 00:23:06.109
Caption: right hand side tone as we said before

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.579
Caption: it is symmetrical is probably audio and

00:23:06.109 --> 00:23:09.589
Caption: there you can see that try to apply the

00:23:07.579 --> 00:23:13.658
Caption: Kraken compression to that which is why

00:23:09.589 --> 00:23:13.658
Caption: there&#39;s a noise on the side but because

00:23:19.009 --> 00:23:24.479
Caption: and then finally guys sir when you kind

00:23:22.379 --> 00:23:26.129
Caption: of see this this is probably the point

00:23:24.479 --> 00:23:27.449
Caption: at which black box analysis of kind of

00:23:26.129 --> 00:23:30.479
Caption: brought its colas sorry

00:23:27.449 --> 00:23:33.569
Caption: and so basically this is the same file

00:23:30.479 --> 00:23:35.849
Caption: compressing entry vehicle place and you

00:23:33.569 --> 00:23:38.339
Caption: know what I&#39;m lefty is based compression

00:23:35.849 --> 00:23:41.668
Caption: and the blog rot is the same button with

00:23:38.339 --> 00:23:43.739
Caption: like RSA encryption applied so if the

00:23:41.668 --> 00:23:45.898
Caption: histograms probably sweat it means it&#39;s

00:23:43.739 --> 00:23:48.569
Caption: indistinguishable amendment was posted

00:23:45.899 --> 00:23:51.029

00:23:48.569 --> 00:23:54.118

Caption: this Daily Post article Walter entropy

00:23:54.119 --> 00:23:59.519
Caption: in the encrypted was and at this point

00:23:56.759 --> 00:24:09.479
Caption: you can&#39;t really just determine how it&#39;s

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:11.460
Caption: compressed hopefully about looking for

00:24:09.479 --> 00:24:15.439
Caption: the right lens I strongly encourage you

00:24:11.459 --> 00:24:15.439
Caption: to just open up every single bottle

00:24:19.849 --> 00:24:27.449
Caption: alright so secondly I want to talk about

00:24:25.019 --> 00:24:29.309
Caption: troubleshooting any problem a very key

00:24:27.449 --> 00:24:31.648
Caption: pot of reverse engineering in the

00:24:29.308 --> 00:24:35.508
Caption: software space is just inspecting the

00:24:31.649 --> 00:24:35.509
Caption: code as it runs it&#39;s an extremely

00:24:56.750 --> 00:26:00.500
Caption: so in the engineering is just as if you

00:25:40.889 --> 00:26:00.500
Caption: have which is to say it&#39;s

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.200
Caption: [Music]

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:12.719
Caption: today is almost guaranteed to be in all

00:26:08.939 --> 00:26:15.500
Caption: the wine which is what quite nice but

00:26:12.719 --> 00:26:22.589
Caption: there are like a couple of downsides

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:24.449
Caption: first one is to keep in except election

00:26:22.589 --> 00:26:29.599
Caption: you betta Margie behold

00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:32.308
Caption: you&#39;ll get 1291 lines of text

00:26:29.599 --> 00:26:32.849
Caption: pumpkins number of beaches you&#39;re never

00:26:32.308 --> 00:26:35.189
Caption: going to use

00:26:32.849 --> 00:26:37.530
Caption: I&#39;d like to make two things first what

00:26:35.189 --> 00:26:39.359
Caption: we&#39;re going on mostly focusing on one

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.369
Caption: specific you can&#39;t just learn one you&#39;ve

00:26:39.359 --> 00:26:43.229
Caption: got to kind of be able to roll with it

00:26:41.369 --> 00:26:45.390
Caption: and quick to weightless the best 1p

00:26:43.229 --> 00:26:47.969
Caption: platform white princess if you&#39;re on an

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:51.450
Caption: emulator don&#39;t go to that and you want

00:26:47.969 --> 00:26:55.380
Caption: to use the pain rather than the system

00:26:51.449 --> 00:26:58.349
Caption: one but it&#39;s not quite as bad on being a

00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:00.719
Caption: little melodramatic here because out of

00:26:58.349 --> 00:27:03.239
Caption: all of that you just need to learn how

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:10.439
Caption: to unroll of HSA you just need to know

00:27:03.239 --> 00:27:12.689
Caption: how to use the rest of cool with you

00:27:10.439 --> 00:27:14.339
Caption: know how to use the rest but zone yoga

00:27:12.689 --> 00:27:16.379
Caption: for futures you really need to know is I

00:27:14.339 --> 00:27:19.459
Caption: guess I can&#39;t escape Dakota so how to

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:22.048
Caption: move backwards and forwards and continue

00:27:19.459 --> 00:27:27.168
Caption: new gonna has set breakpoints obviously

00:27:22.048 --> 00:27:27.168
Caption: so be able to stop

00:27:45.349 --> 00:27:48.449
Caption: [Music]

00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:04.350
Caption: and bumpy&#39;s one of those cases where

00:28:02.699 --> 00:28:07.048
Caption: it&#39;s where I was talking about before

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:09.359
Caption: you can basically practice you can

00:28:07.048 --> 00:28:11.130
Caption: practice through using it and the skills

00:28:09.359 --> 00:28:12.869
Caption: will transfer over to the slightly out

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.690
Caption: of your hand so some of the best

00:28:12.869 --> 00:28:23.579
Caption: training you can get for reverse

00:28:15.689 --> 00:28:26.009
Caption: engineering so it&#39;ll make you better

00:28:23.579 --> 00:28:29.250
Caption: moving around the program shopping your

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:41.789
Caption: investigative wits and later on when you

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:49.079
Caption: have the sources I just want to quickly

00:28:41.788 --> 00:28:50.908
Caption: run through I do share parenting

00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:53.278
Caption: this isn&#39;t prescriptive you do not have

00:28:50.909 --> 00:29:00.059
Caption: to follow this to the letter it&#39;s more

00:28:53.279 --> 00:29:02.340
Caption: than you by the way so these are the

00:29:00.058 --> 00:29:04.558
Caption: steps basically firstly first step is

00:29:02.339 --> 00:29:06.719
Caption: always to come track reduced behavior in

00:29:04.558 --> 00:29:07.798
Caption: a testing run so behind beautiful sweet

00:29:06.719 --> 00:29:10.319
Caption: like a problem or a feature to

00:29:07.798 --> 00:29:12.148
Caption: investigate quite often this is the

00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:13.859
Caption: hottest step which is actually getting

00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:19.179
Caption: to run

00:29:13.859 --> 00:29:21.250
Caption: but secondly is to establish some

00:29:19.178 --> 00:29:23.289
Caption: boundaries of the system if your system

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:25.089
Caption: is using a bunch of saying like helper

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.520
Caption: libraries make sure that you can kind of

00:29:25.089 --> 00:29:29.319
Caption: like I guess either include them or

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.299
Caption: eliminate them using spell it&#39;s about

00:29:29.319 --> 00:29:32.678
Caption: like I&#39;m fencing off the curves of just

00:29:31.298 --> 00:29:35.500
Caption: a bit that you won&#39;t investigate

00:29:32.678 --> 00:29:37.058
Caption: pretty much the ones message to observe

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.890
Caption: for points of interest now point of

00:29:37.058 --> 00:29:41.500
Caption: interest would be anything that kind of

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:42.969
Caption: anything interesting that happens any

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.619
Caption: kind of students that would happen for

00:29:42.969 --> 00:29:46.630
Caption: instance during a problem where the

00:29:44.619 --> 00:29:48.308
Caption: specific voiding of an error message and

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:51.130
Caption: the monitor is a you&#39;re trying to kind

00:29:48.308 --> 00:29:53.349
Caption: of figure out I guess what state inside

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.650
Caption: the program is flipping between good and

00:29:53.349 --> 00:29:56.380
Caption: bad

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:58.059
Caption: I mean visit there&#39;s a specific check

00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.880
Caption: that&#39;s fairly but quite making notice

00:29:58.058 --> 00:30:02.168
Caption: but what that check is and then just

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.530
Caption: make like a short list a piece of these

00:30:02.168 --> 00:30:05.709
Caption: things

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:07.119
Caption: well this define an entry point close to

00:30:05.709 --> 00:30:09.308
Caption: one of these points of interest so an

00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:11.410
Caption: entry point is just literally open up

00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:12.939
Caption: the program that the buggah place of

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:17.919
Caption: breakpoints at love these things and

00:30:12.939 --> 00:30:19.269
Caption: step three and finally trace through to

00:30:17.918 --> 00:30:24.428
Caption: the exact moment that it actually

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:26.890
Caption: happens so this is basically Ferguson

00:30:24.428 --> 00:30:28.239
Caption: just comes in through the code keep in

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.709
Caption: mind any of that states why don&#39;t you

00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:32.290
Caption: grab a point let&#39;s butchers we look too

00:30:29.709 --> 00:30:35.349
Caption: bad if you do find a spot where it has

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:36.700
Caption: kind of good to bad work backwards

00:30:35.349 --> 00:30:38.949
Caption: trying to figure out what is cool is

00:30:36.699 --> 00:30:41.079
Caption: that chain of events to reach that that

00:30:38.949 --> 00:30:42.689
Caption: specific spot to find out what pulls the

00:30:41.079 --> 00:30:46.529
Caption: check to me Boston for instance and

00:30:42.689 --> 00:30:46.529
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty much it

00:30:46.949 --> 00:30:52.859
Caption: when you have a source card it is by

00:30:51.209 --> 00:30:54.268
Caption: practicing this again it&#39;s just about

00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:57.178
Caption: catching in the muscle memory the

00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:59.609
Caption: moments and when you have no soul scars

00:30:57.178 --> 00:31:00.439
Caption: the procedure is pretty much exactly the

00:30:59.609 --> 00:31:01.669
Caption: same

00:31:00.439 --> 00:31:04.469
Caption: [Music]

00:31:01.668 --> 00:31:09.268
Caption: modifications I highly encourage you

00:31:04.469 --> 00:31:10.579
Caption: just get as much practice as possible if

00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:12.960
Caption: you can&#39;t just just challenge yourself

00:31:10.579 --> 00:31:14.969
Caption: because favorite open source project

00:31:12.959 --> 00:31:17.459
Caption: that you otherwise just kind of was

00:31:14.969 --> 00:31:30.329
Caption: being too hot and trying to fix above

00:31:17.459 --> 00:31:35.239
Caption: even a crazy amount finally one Eric

00:31:30.329 --> 00:31:35.239
Caption: discussion this is how to understand any

00:31:37.609 --> 00:31:42.808
Caption: pages I was just like power-mad on

00:31:40.969 --> 00:31:45.209
Caption: possibilities that would open up and

00:31:42.808 --> 00:31:47.699
Caption: he&#39;s just it seemed such like a great

00:31:45.209 --> 00:31:51.058
Caption: thing and sorry it took me about several

00:31:47.699 --> 00:31:59.069
Caption: types of ideas to be truly comfortable

00:31:51.058 --> 00:32:00.928
Caption: with it and I just let&#39;s talk about

00:31:59.069 --> 00:32:03.329
Caption: let&#39;s talk a bit about assembly language

00:32:00.928 --> 00:32:04.979
Caption: as you might a cold as motor pool we&#39;re

00:32:03.329 --> 00:32:07.498
Caption: building about you can break down in the

00:32:04.979 --> 00:32:08.788
Caption: assembly language but it won&#39;t be fully

00:32:07.499 --> 00:32:10.349
Caption: you can only see through this tiny

00:32:08.788 --> 00:32:15.709
Caption: window about this tiny window that

00:32:10.349 --> 00:32:19.489
Caption: follows with our progress is in the very

00:32:15.709 --> 00:32:19.489
Caption: principle to make any kind of

00:32:24.050 --> 00:34:54.840
Caption: [Music]

00:32:26.239 --> 00:34:58.489
Caption: language is also is underneath there&#39;ll

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.489
Caption: be some aesthetic dog which is like old

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:04.380
Caption: stack of strings and such memory of

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:06.119
Caption: course we need members who they&#39;ll be

00:35:04.379 --> 00:35:08.459
Caption: like a penis attack of temperature Marie

00:35:06.118 --> 00:35:10.439
Caption: at one of the averages but is the stack

00:35:08.459 --> 00:35:12.209
Caption: and course the program can ask the

00:35:10.439 --> 00:35:14.280
Caption: operating system for more memory when

00:35:12.209 --> 00:35:17.608
Caption: it&#39;s running so every time it does that

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:20.400
Caption: it will have a new statement allocation

00:35:17.608 --> 00:35:22.618
Caption: it&#39;s here talking about the operators we

00:35:20.399 --> 00:35:25.419
Caption: also need to include the entire

00:35:22.618 --> 00:35:28.789
Caption: operating system kernel

00:35:25.419 --> 00:35:33.020
Caption: just in case we need one thing from

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:35.000
Caption: antara braces and then the same ones

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:37.489
Caption: also causing us to income calamities so

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.110
Caption: obviously we have shin Barbies that we

00:35:37.489 --> 00:35:40.669
Caption: use in this program they&#39;re gonna have a

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:43.790
Caption: signal as well

00:35:40.669 --> 00:35:48.020
Caption: now that&#39;s the address space elevator

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:51.290
Caption: now CPA sorry I&#39;m late no a little

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:53.120
Caption: steeper the most CPUs of kind of work

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:55.189
Caption: exactly the same but bear with me on

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:57.380
Caption: this because knowing that I&#39;m different

00:35:55.189 --> 00:35:59.030
Caption: but you can make you can make a bunch of

00:35:57.379 --> 00:36:01.729
Caption: assumptions about how CP was going over

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:03.830
Caption: it&#39;s going to be a bunch of registers

00:36:01.729 --> 00:36:06.530
Caption: these places just variables right but it

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:08.780
Caption: holds like one number one memory address

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:12.040
Caption: and these are used for nice and just

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:13.840
Caption: like you know math or reading or writing

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.370
Caption: [Music]

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.260
Caption: you have general purpose registers and

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.940
Caption: the love you like a couple special wants

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.560
Caption: to it like this voice up gonna be a

00:36:19.939 --> 00:36:25.099
Caption: special register which points to where

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:28.280
Caption: we will always be that so every time we

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:31.489
Caption: execute instructions in program council

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.590
Caption: of it forwards there&#39;ll always be a

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:35.929
Caption: Flags registers so this is kind of how

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:38.210
Caption: if statements and such our evaluator

00:36:35.929 --> 00:36:41.359
Caption: will see you basically every time an

00:36:38.209 --> 00:36:42.889
Caption: instruction runs it will change the

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.700
Caption: flags register based on say

00:36:42.889 --> 00:36:48.699
Caption: philosophy question is this value 0

00:36:45.699 --> 00:36:48.699
Caption: value

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.859
Caption: [Music]

00:37:42.120 --> 00:38:05.830
Caption: that&#39;s interesting so well shared

00:38:00.639 --> 00:38:06.909
Caption: libraries again so obviously to do many

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:09.040
Caption: of these things it&#39;s going to call

00:38:06.909 --> 00:38:11.079
Caption: either the shared library or the kernel

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:14.919
Caption: and these are public made guys which

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:16.540
Caption: means we still have the names now for

00:38:14.919 --> 00:38:18.069
Caption: the for the most probably disassembly

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:20.380
Caption: something unless you&#39;re really lucky and

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.910
Caption: you get a debug version you&#39;re not gonna

00:38:20.379 --> 00:38:24.279
Caption: be able to see me the next week we&#39;ll be

00:38:21.909 --> 00:38:25.809
Caption: able to see where all of these public

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:28.120
Caption: you guys have been cold and it&#39;s

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:30.040
Caption: incredibly useful for instance sounds

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:32.470
Caption: trying to kind of figure out how all the

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:36.600
Caption: way was working to go and say okay so

00:38:32.469 --> 00:38:36.599
Caption: there&#39;s 29,000 different

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.630
Caption: [Music]

00:38:54.729 --> 00:39:37.098
Caption: as you can see basically sees they

00:39:34.399 --> 00:39:39.289
Caption: really want you to use their that city

00:39:37.099 --> 00:39:41.390
Caption: news right so one of the tools they&#39;ll

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:47.150
Caption: provide you is a document called an

00:39:41.389 --> 00:39:50.769
Caption: instruction set breakfast every single

00:39:47.149 --> 00:39:55.789
Caption: instruction in the CPU actually does

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:59.390
Caption: this PDF ranking text file in another

00:39:55.790 --> 00:40:01.040
Caption: window and you copy each line into

00:39:59.389 --> 00:40:02.989
Caption: whatever format you need to think the

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.540
Caption: least about so - like like if it goes

00:40:02.989 --> 00:40:11.358
Caption: through 32 US aid but basically just

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:13.250
Caption: like by the line convert it sounds

00:40:11.358 --> 00:40:15.578
Caption: slurred and back-breaking but you have

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.579
Caption: two advantages

00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:19.979
Caption: interesting as we&#39;ve established you can

00:40:18.839 --> 00:40:22.410
Caption: filter out the things that are no

00:40:19.979 --> 00:40:27.029
Caption: interesting quite quickly and secondly

00:40:22.409 --> 00:40:29.038
Caption: it&#39;s basically that it sounds slow but

00:40:27.029 --> 00:40:31.289
Caption: trust me here it&#39;s actually bigger than

00:40:29.039 --> 00:40:34.499
Caption: just like staring at something written

00:40:31.289 --> 00:40:42.749
Caption: in this dream moon language and in front

00:40:34.499 --> 00:40:46.589
Caption: of the pond where it is just being very

00:40:42.749 --> 00:40:48.989
Caption: rough like this but afterwards you can

00:40:46.589 --> 00:40:51.150
Caption: ship away but you slowly add more of all

00:40:48.989 --> 00:40:52.559
Caption: things that you found out and just to

00:40:51.149 --> 00:40:54.568
Caption: just be clear this is like a tiny

00:40:52.559 --> 00:40:56.218
Caption: snippet the actual function that it&#39;s

00:40:54.569 --> 00:40:58.680
Caption: what this poem is about 300 lines we

00:40:56.218 --> 00:41:00.449
Caption: don&#39;t have that in here but from that

00:40:58.679 --> 00:41:02.308
Caption: you can trace through you can slowly

00:41:00.449 --> 00:41:04.858
Caption: figure out I guess what the inputs the

00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:09.479
Caption: outputs when we play those back up the

00:41:04.858 --> 00:41:11.488
Caption: chain and you get upper pastas

00:41:09.479 --> 00:41:13.909
Caption: formations you get something like this

00:41:11.489 --> 00:41:16.279
Caption: and you can kind of make out where the

00:41:13.909 --> 00:41:20.038
Caption: you can&#39;t make that way the other

00:41:16.279 --> 00:41:21.569
Caption: variables were staying from but again if

00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:24.180
Caption: you have the entire function that you

00:41:21.569 --> 00:41:30.569
Caption: can transfer you can slowly even if it&#39;s

00:41:24.179 --> 00:41:32.519
Caption: the no correct guesses really that&#39;s all

00:41:30.569 --> 00:41:33.930
Caption: there is to it once you have that entry

00:41:32.519 --> 00:41:36.299
Caption: point from which you can make more

00:41:33.929 --> 00:41:38.939
Caption: discoveries and cross-check that with a

00:41:36.299 --> 00:41:41.910
Caption: lot of code on the debugger you this is

00:41:38.939 --> 00:41:43.948
Caption: basically that you can read any program

00:41:41.909 --> 00:41:47.129
Caption: and much like much like the buggy the

00:41:43.948 --> 00:41:49.289
Caption: school just comes with I guess amount of

00:41:47.129 --> 00:41:50.578
Caption: time spent will you get more confident

00:41:49.289 --> 00:41:53.489
Caption: and experience the more times you try

00:41:50.579 --> 00:41:55.259
Caption: this even if you don&#39;t succeed so if

00:41:53.489 --> 00:41:56.339
Caption: this sounds like something you ever

00:41:55.259 --> 00:41:57.839
Caption: wanted to try

00:41:56.339 --> 00:42:04.349
Caption: I recommend just giving it a shot just

00:41:57.839 --> 00:42:20.968
Caption: once just to see unfortunately always at

00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:22.859
Caption: the end of time here today but if

00:42:20.968 --> 00:42:25.229
Caption: there&#39;s one thing that I hope to kind of

00:42:22.858 --> 00:42:27.419
Caption: like shed and like people to take away

00:42:25.229 --> 00:42:28.769
Caption: today it&#39;s the idea that it&#39;s possible

00:42:27.419 --> 00:42:31.608
Caption: to get started in some of the very

00:42:28.769 --> 00:42:37.949
Caption: hottest areas of reverse engineering

00:42:31.608 --> 00:42:40.468
Caption: without knowing very much but you can

00:42:37.949 --> 00:42:42.779
Caption: feel the side much stronger I&#39;m ready to

00:42:40.468 --> 00:42:48.899
Caption: progress up the chain to complicated

00:42:42.779 --> 00:42:51.119
Caption: things and in closing I just wanted to

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:52.578
Caption: say the best absolute best over that is

00:42:51.118 --> 00:42:56.058
Caption: reverse engineering

00:42:52.579 --> 00:42:58.468
Caption: it&#39;s just passionately there&#39;s once

00:42:56.059 --> 00:43:00.869
Caption: basically this is truly to do with

00:42:58.468 --> 00:43:04.429
Caption: perseverance outlays absolutely

00:43:00.868 --> 00:43:04.429
Caption: everything including skill and

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.019
Caption: [Music]

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:21.250
Caption: [Applause]

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:41.419
Caption: all the fever&#39;s proudly serving officer

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:48.709
Caption: pain question what&#39;s the people who were

00:43:41.419 --> 00:43:51.319
Caption: most proud for best engineering or okay

00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:54.949
Caption: I&#39;m probably the thing that I like the

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:57.229
Caption: most is on reverse you know Macromedia

00:43:54.949 --> 00:44:00.139
Caption: director yeah at the moment I&#39;m trying

00:43:57.229 --> 00:44:04.550
Caption: to kind of work on the engine for that

00:44:00.139 --> 00:44:06.889
Caption: scummvm most of just because not sure a

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:09.020
Caption: lot of you what they were this kind of

00:44:06.889 --> 00:44:11.299
Caption: this great series of educational games

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:13.250
Caption: by some reason Duncan and but for the

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.420
Caption: longest time like I painted this King

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:16.790
Caption: started there was like a streaming

00:44:14.419 --> 00:44:19.098
Caption: version that they were getting and it

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:20.900
Caption: just didn&#39;t seem as been I thought well

00:44:19.099 --> 00:44:21.530
Caption: I wanted to work on this company in

00:44:20.899 --> 00:44:23.449
Caption: Manhattan

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:25.070
Caption: it&#39;s make sense right to preserve the

00:44:23.449 --> 00:44:27.439
Caption: things before that in this particular

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:29.030
Caption: series was critically acclaimed the only

00:44:27.439 --> 00:44:32.449
Caption: month cement industry come on site

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:40.119
Caption: absolutely no one is going to view it

00:44:32.449 --> 00:44:40.118
Caption: unless someone steps up knows it yeah

00:44:47.850 --> 00:45:15.780
Caption: I guess that would like depend on the

00:45:00.929 --> 00:45:24.329
Caption: exact agreement that you what was the

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:27.929
Caption: what was the exact sequester it&#39;s

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:31.260
Caption: actually feasible to distribute the

00:45:27.929 --> 00:45:33.510
Caption: results of your work kind of straight

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:37.500
Caption: pre-made question to the recording just

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:39.300
Caption: natural so if you are reverse engineer I

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:42.120
Caption: mean you want to share the results of

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:44.429
Caption: that are there any legal implications I

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:46.530
Caption: think so long as your solution doesn&#39;t

00:45:44.429 --> 00:45:48.949
Caption: actually incorporate all the parts

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:48.949
Caption: itself

00:45:54.939 --> 00:46:02.629
Caption: one more and then inside of the morning

00:45:57.169 --> 00:46:05.449
Caption: say I can&#39;t believe it that everyone

00:46:02.629 --> 00:46:07.548
Caption: please remember you&#39;ll lead back it&#39;s

00:46:05.449 --> 00:46:08.868
Caption: really important to be able to win any

00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:12.199
Caption: of the prizes you need to give you

00:46:08.868 --> 00:46:13.419
Caption: feedback and morning tea is available us

00:46:12.199 --> 00:46:14.280
Caption: as

00:46:13.419 --> 00:46:21.138
Caption: you

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:21.138
Caption: [Applause]
