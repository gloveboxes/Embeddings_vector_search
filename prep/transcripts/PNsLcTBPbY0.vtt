00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:05.609
Caption: good price one of the amazing keynotes

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.098
Caption: and breakout sessions and website

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.509
Caption: theater really and I will be your thing

00:00:11.098 --> 00:00:15.659
Caption: that they say yes would be here boys

00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:17.639
Caption: philosophy apologies for that it is

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:20.188
Caption: actually my massive pleasure for the

00:00:17.639 --> 00:00:22.229
Caption: second year in a row we work that well

00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:23.729
Caption: to introduce many viable to the state so

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:25.379
Caption: that&#39;s really introduce our functional

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:27.118
Caption: it&#39;s the about all and this is he&#39;s

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:29.489
Caption: promised us of the incredibly special

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:31.649
Caption: with browser censoring the eyes and a

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:41.549
Caption: pretty basic demo as well so without

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:44.000
Caption: further ado them to say hi everyone

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:46.200
Caption: welcome to dd8

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.558
Caption: special thanks to all of the sponsors

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.959
Caption: today

00:00:46.558 --> 00:00:50.519
Caption: you may even be possible they like so

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:53.069
Caption: many of them it&#39;s really great Pacific

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.659
Caption: companies particularly but local

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:56.659
Caption: companies are supporting the conference

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:01.069
Caption: the clicker isn&#39;t working

00:01:02.488 --> 00:01:08.650
Caption: okay my name is Mandy Michael I&#39;m a

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.360
Caption: front-end developer and the development

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.659
Caption: manager at seven West media here in

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.750
Caption: Perth I like to experiment and to tinker

00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:19.779
Caption: with things on the web so that&#39;s kind of

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.879
Caption: what we&#39;re gonna have a look at today my

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:24.849
Caption: passion is experimenting with different

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:26.648
Caption: front-end technologies new hat all to

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:28.779
Caption: see how we can combine them and create

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.399
Caption: some cool and exciting things so that&#39;s

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:33.549
Caption: what we&#39;re going to do today we&#39;re gonna

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.020
Caption: look at some fun that stuff we can make

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.789
Caption: the senses and brass and ice

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:38.799
Caption: specifically we&#39;re going to look at

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.119
Caption: three things we have a look at speech

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.690
Caption: recognition device orientation and the

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.610
Caption: ambient light sensor but before I get

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.350
Caption: into showing you some stuff I want to

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.349
Caption: take a couple of things really clear I

00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:57.928
Caption: have to be standing upright

00:01:55.089 --> 00:02:01.439
Caption: yes miss take it away thing number one

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:04.149
Caption: what we&#39;re going to be looking at today

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.909
Caption: funding experiments I&#39;m not going to

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.790
Caption: show you anything particularly serious

00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:11.500
Caption: with it the reason for that isn&#39;t

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.939
Caption: because you can&#39;t it&#39;s just if I wanted

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.759
Caption: to make some fun demo it&#39;s because I

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.229
Caption: like to do I talk about some fun things

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.669
Caption: that you can do but this time I&#39;m going

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:21.399
Caption: to show you is just going to be some

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:23.559
Caption: funny examples the other thing is that I

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:25.389
Caption: wanted to mention is that some of the

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:27.220
Caption: examples that I&#39;m going to show you are

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.679
Caption: going to have great browser support and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.720
Caption: some not so much

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:33.849
Caption: I&#39;m not really going to go into a lot of

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.860
Caption: detail about browser support I will show

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.958
Caption: you on the next by the legend of what

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.789
Caption: the support is but whatever fight can

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:42.309
Caption: that you do is try not to point this on

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:44.199
Caption: that kind of stuff take a step back and

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.250
Caption: just enjoy and listen and maybe be

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.629
Caption: inspired

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.580
Caption: kind of things that you could use this

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.300
Caption: boy in your projects now or in the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.860
Caption: future

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.660
Caption: pretty much everything on the web

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.000
Caption: started back started out of the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.740
Caption: experimental technology so we need to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.639
Caption: start figuring out how to make use of

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.010
Caption: this now so this is the support legend

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.500
Caption: and the beginning of each section I&#39;m

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:09.339
Caption: going to put up on the slides some

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.289
Caption: comprise my guys a full-auto means full

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.300
Caption: support if there&#39;s a flag that means you

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:14.949
Caption: have to enable a flag and even its star

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.440
Caption: it means it will be fully supported in

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:19.360
Caption: the next version so from this point on

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.240
Caption: I&#39;m not gonna mention browser support I

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.369
Caption: can go check it out when can I use all

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.980
Caption: their MDM Docs but keep an eye out for

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:31.479
Caption: the logos as we go through so we&#39;re

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:34.769
Caption: gonna dive right in and the first thing

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:37.750
Caption: we know about is web speech API is ID so

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.340
Caption: the web speech API basically enables you

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.449
Caption: to incorporate different boy started

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:45.099
Caption: into web apps and it&#39;s split into two

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:48.849
Caption: interfaces there&#39;s a speech recognition

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.620
Caption: API for recognizing audio and turning it

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.529
Caption: into text and then there&#39;s a speech

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:55.899
Caption: synthesis API and that turns text into a

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:57.610
Caption: computer-generated voice what we&#39;re

00:03:55.899 --> 00:04:01.419
Caption: going to look at today is specifically

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.039
Caption: speech recognition that is assimil art

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:05.919
Caption: and you can share a few things between

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:07.809
Caption: the two but if you want to go and check

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.099
Caption: out more about speech synthesis I highly

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:12.639
Caption: recommend you check out and sell his

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:18.429
Caption: dogs so at this point we&#39;re going to try

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:19.899
Caption: using the internet which is old so I

00:04:18.429 --> 00:04:23.199
Caption: want to show you what speech recognition

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:29.109
Caption: looks like hello day today my name is

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:32.080
Caption: Mindy after my clean writing to work so

00:04:29.109 --> 00:04:33.339
Caption: so what we&#39;re doing is speaking into the

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:35.289
Caption: microphone and then the speech

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:37.419
Caption: recognition API is trying to determine

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.040
Caption: what if what I said and you might have

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.090
Caption: noticed some of the words were changing

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.830
Caption: as it right out

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:43.750
Caption: that&#39;s because it thought I said

00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:45.669
Caption: something then you&#39;ve got more context

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.790
Caption: and it changed to get a more accurate

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.990
Caption: confidence rating in what I&#39;ve said so

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.970
Caption: I&#39;m going to show you how to make this

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:54.910
Caption: because it&#39;s pretty straightforward

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.040
Caption: it&#39;s not about me in it this is what I&#39;m

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.040
Caption: going to show you Sukhoi there&#39;s not a

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.380
Caption: lot of co2 required to make this work

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:08.470
Caption: absolutely so don&#39;t worry about it if

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:11.679
Caption: you&#39;re not a developer I picked up the

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.000
Caption: wrong with ago so this is the first

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:14.380
Caption: thing that we&#39;re going to be we&#39;re going

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.200
Caption: to need to make use of the speech

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.570
Caption: recognition constructor and what this is

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.490
Caption: going to do is create an object instance

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.890
Caption: that gives us access to all the api&#39;s

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:26.049
Caption: methods and properties there are a few

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.730
Caption: of them for speech recognition so I&#39;m

00:05:26.049 --> 00:05:29.679
Caption: going to keep it really simple and just

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:34.630
Caption: show you the ones you need to make that

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:37.649
Caption: a specific example the next things we

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.020
Caption: need a couple amendments start and stop

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:42.970
Caption: they pretty much do what you detect they

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:45.309
Caption: stop the speech recognition service and

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.500
Caption: they stop the speech recognition service

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:50.889
Caption: or listening to incoming audio these

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.809
Caption: best to think about stop is that a lot

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.580
Caption: we&#39;ve stopping it it also attempts to

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:57.880
Caption: return a result captured from the

00:05:54.579 --> 00:06:00.939
Caption: microphone we&#39;re also going to need some

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.309
Caption: event endless most of them simply listen

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.799
Caption: there changes in recognition status so

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:08.369
Caption: the Tory I&#39;m gonna focus on about result

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:11.589
Caption: and on speech end so you aren&#39;t result

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:14.799
Caption: who run or whatever a word or phrase has

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:16.688
Caption: been recognized and this basically

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:20.289
Caption: happens every single time

00:06:16.688 --> 00:06:22.748
Caption: is the use off speak a word or several

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:26.169
Caption: ways in quick succession on a speech

00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:27.488
Caption: edit what this does is just running

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.009
Caption: where the services stop being detected

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:31.269
Caption: it&#39;s kind of like if you pause for any

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.588
Caption: length of time that&#39;s where this is

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:37.299
Caption: going to fire now last thing this is

00:06:35.588 --> 00:06:39.569
Caption: going to be the most complicated thing

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:41.949
Caption: I&#39;m going to explain to you all day so

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:44.438
Caption: that this is going to set the scene for

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.860
Caption: how fun the rest is going to be the

00:06:44.438 --> 00:06:49.268
Caption: speech recognition API is a little bit

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:52.178
Caption: complicated in that it can return

00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:55.839
Caption: multiple results and multiple options of

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:58.118
Caption: those results so what happens is we can

00:06:55.838 --> 00:07:00.398
Caption: get the result list the speech

00:06:58.118 --> 00:07:04.328
Caption: recognition result this project and that

00:07:00.398 --> 00:07:06.308
Caption: has the speech recognition result object

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:09.669
Caption: and that has the speech recognition

00:07:06.308 --> 00:07:11.408
Caption: results alternatives which is a little

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:13.419
Caption: bit confusing but as I say because the

00:07:11.408 --> 00:07:16.898
Caption: speech recognition API rhetorical

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:19.389
Caption: results it kind of needs a few ways in

00:07:16.898 --> 00:07:21.278
Caption: which you can access these for the

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:22.959
Caption: purposes of today we&#39;re just going to

00:07:21.278 --> 00:07:25.628
Caption: get one result and we&#39;re going to focus

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:27.789
Caption: on this feature increasing prism speech

00:07:25.628 --> 00:07:29.618
Caption: recognition alternative object which is

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:31.688
Caption: where the transcript for the text that

00:07:29.618 --> 00:07:34.148
Caption: it thought I heard from the microphone

00:07:31.688 --> 00:07:35.859
Caption: place sorry in our court it&#39;s going to

00:07:34.148 --> 00:07:39.109
Caption: look like this we have our list object

00:07:35.859 --> 00:07:41.539
Caption: we get the best result the first result

00:07:39.109 --> 00:07:44.509
Caption: and the transcript and we can throw that

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.190
Caption: all together into a function the only

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.960
Caption: extra thing I&#39;m doing here aside from

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.170
Caption: using what I&#39;ve already shown you is

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:53.000
Caption: looking for a div on the page actually

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.390
Caption: melody of a paragraph but that&#39;s more

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.839
Caption: semantically correct and then I am

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:01.580
Caption: updating the content on results to cause

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:03.679
Caption: the result of my speech recognition

00:08:01.579 --> 00:08:06.079
Caption: object to keep today that&#39;s it and

00:08:03.679 --> 00:08:08.239
Caption: that&#39;s how my making that example all

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:10.039
Caption: this code is all you need to do that so

00:08:08.239 --> 00:08:11.750
Caption: you can see that it&#39;s really simple to

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.260
Caption: get started with using speech

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:17.000
Caption: recognition API but if you want it you

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.880
Caption: don&#39;t have to just print text out on

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.589
Caption: screen you can you know do something a

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:27.320
Caption: bit more fun like like this this is my

00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:33.489
Caption: Michael Frank I love dogs my dog sign is

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:37.030
Caption: jelly this is my notes alter-ego Mel boy

00:08:33.489 --> 00:08:37.029
Caption: who&#39;s a good boy

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:42.890
Caption: these are good boy so all I&#39;m doing new

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.680
Caption: with this is detecting for a specific

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:47.590
Caption: phrase and when that phrase is detected

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:50.719
Caption: by the speech recognition API I&#39;m

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:54.260
Caption: changing subjects on the page in my SVG

00:08:50.719 --> 00:09:04.819
Caption: and also automating the tagging ievel so

00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:06.350
Caption: it does play the ball and it&#39;s a way

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.030
Caption: so there&#39;s like a bunch of things that

00:09:06.349 --> 00:09:10.130
Caption: you can do with this you don&#39;t have to

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.680
Caption: just think about it in terms of printing

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:15.770
Caption: text out of the screen what I think is

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:17.479
Caption: really interesting about it is that it&#39;s

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.660
Caption: going to allow us to create more

00:09:17.479 --> 00:09:20.789
Caption: interactive and more

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:23.190
Caption: experiences if you think about the fact

00:09:20.789 --> 00:09:25.318
Caption: that not everyone is going to use our

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:27.898
Caption: computers that our website - using a

00:09:25.318 --> 00:09:30.088
Caption: keyboard and a mouse sometimes people

00:09:27.898 --> 00:09:33.119
Caption: are using other kinds of inputs and we

00:09:30.088 --> 00:09:35.398
Caption: can provide that with different aspects

00:09:33.119 --> 00:09:37.828
Caption: of our websites I had a conversation

00:09:35.398 --> 00:09:39.448
Caption: with someone at my work about using

00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:41.729
Caption: speech recognition to allow people to

00:09:39.448 --> 00:09:44.729
Caption: search the page maybe you want them to

00:09:41.729 --> 00:09:45.869
Caption: be on a stop and stop video or navigate

00:09:44.729 --> 00:09:47.549
Caption: between your page with speech

00:09:45.869 --> 00:09:51.119
Caption: recognition there are a lot of

00:09:47.549 --> 00:09:53.008
Caption: opportunities there so the next thing

00:09:51.119 --> 00:09:57.599
Caption: that I wanted to talk about was device

00:09:53.008 --> 00:09:59.188
Caption: orientation so point about web enabled

00:09:57.599 --> 00:10:01.349
Caption: devices have something like a gyroscope

00:09:59.189 --> 00:10:04.279
Caption: or an accelerometer and that can

00:10:01.349 --> 00:10:07.049
Caption: determine the device&#39;s orientation and

00:10:04.278 --> 00:10:09.148
Caption: return some information on that it&#39;s

00:10:07.049 --> 00:10:11.578
Caption: commonly seen in things like mobile

00:10:09.148 --> 00:10:13.679
Caption: devices to automatically rotate your

00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:15.208
Caption: screen to the right way up I really

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:17.159
Caption: think that so I turn it off

00:10:15.208 --> 00:10:20.128
Caption: but that&#39;s the way we see it a lot of

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:22.198
Caption: the time and it&#39;s just going to allow us

00:10:20.129 --> 00:10:26.250
Caption: to access that information about the

00:10:22.198 --> 00:10:27.750
Caption: device in order to use that black speech

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.208
Caption: recognition we need a couple of things

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:33.239
Caption: the first if the device orientation

00:10:30.208 --> 00:10:35.309
Caption: event and this provides the information

00:10:33.239 --> 00:10:37.708
Caption: on the physical orientation of the

00:10:35.309 --> 00:10:39.258
Caption: device that we&#39;re using and from that we

00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:41.729
Caption: can then access and view properties

00:10:39.258 --> 00:10:44.750
Caption: specifically there are three called

00:10:41.729 --> 00:10:46.909
Caption: alpha gamma and beta and they return

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:54.489
Caption: different number values depending on the

00:10:46.909 --> 00:10:57.588
Caption: device orientation so the first one is

00:10:54.489 --> 00:10:59.719
Caption: the Alpha property and this is basically

00:10:57.588 --> 00:11:01.849
Caption: the direction that the device is facing

00:10:59.719 --> 00:11:05.628
Caption: so if you think about it it&#39;s kind of

00:11:01.849 --> 00:11:09.169
Caption: like turning it around in a circle much

00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:13.579
Caption: like a compass it has a range from 0 to

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:15.979
Caption: 360 the second one is the beta of

00:11:13.578 --> 00:11:18.109
Caption: company and this represents tooting the

00:11:15.979 --> 00:11:21.229
Caption: whole lives are influenced and backwards

00:11:18.109 --> 00:11:24.528
Caption: and that has a range of minus 180 280

00:11:21.229 --> 00:11:28.518
Caption: and then the last one is the gamma

00:11:24.528 --> 00:11:31.219
Caption: property and this is represented by

00:11:28.518 --> 00:11:36.528
Caption: tucking the phone at left all right

00:11:31.219 --> 00:11:38.028
Caption: and it&#39;s arranged minus 90 to 90 so in

00:11:36.528 --> 00:11:39.588
Caption: order to use it the first thing we have

00:11:38.028 --> 00:11:42.078
Caption: to do is check that we have access to

00:11:39.588 --> 00:11:44.088
Caption: this information so we can just see if

00:11:42.078 --> 00:11:46.219
Caption: it exists in the window if it does we

00:11:44.088 --> 00:11:47.958
Caption: can add an event listener of device

00:11:46.219 --> 00:11:51.619
Caption: orientation and then we can pass the

00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:54.318
Caption: function in this is an example of one

00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:58.698
Caption: super simple all I&#39;m doing is getting

00:11:54.318 --> 00:12:01.458
Caption: the government property if it&#39;s minus 50

00:11:58.698 --> 00:12:04.518
Caption: I&#39;m going to do something and this code

00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:07.898
Caption: is specifically how I make this demo as

00:12:04.518 --> 00:12:10.128
Caption: you can see my phone is cracked

00:12:07.898 --> 00:12:11.778
Caption: probably from playing the device

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:13.759
Caption: orientation and don&#39;t pay attention not

00:12:11.778 --> 00:12:16.609
Caption: really I drop my phone all the time all

00:12:13.758 --> 00:12:19.909
Caption: I&#39;m doing here is as firing the tools

00:12:16.609 --> 00:12:24.549
Caption: and reaches a negative 50 gamma value

00:12:19.909 --> 00:12:27.329
Caption: I&#39;m just updating the CSS of my text and

00:12:24.549 --> 00:12:29.830
Caption: going over to the side of the screen

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:32.110
Caption: this is also American fun so it also

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:34.720
Caption: tilts based on the camera orientation

00:12:32.109 --> 00:12:36.250
Caption: but there&#39;s a lot of the simple kind of

00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:39.099
Caption: interactive things that you can do with

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:41.859
Caption: that another example which is texted

00:12:39.099 --> 00:12:43.958
Caption: back based because you don&#39;t know I like

00:12:41.859 --> 00:12:46.328
Caption: to make a lot of text effects this

00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:48.518
Caption: example is one that I use a lot it might

00:12:46.328 --> 00:12:51.609
Caption: take the VEX presentation on its coldest

00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:54.609
Caption: pathetical out I use it to demo a simple

00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:56.799
Caption: text effects what I&#39;m doing here is

00:12:54.609 --> 00:12:58.390
Caption: using the orientation of the phone to

00:12:56.799 --> 00:13:02.559
Caption: move the position of the background

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:06.429
Caption: gradient so that gives shifts along the

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:09.190
Caption: text this all I&#39;m doing is using that

00:13:06.429 --> 00:13:10.869
Caption: point that I showed you before but try

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:14.799
Caption: seeing the value of the gamma property

00:13:10.869 --> 00:13:17.559
Caption: through to the gradient percentage you

00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:21.549
Caption: can also do something like this I took

00:13:17.559 --> 00:13:24.518
Caption: this SVG off I start breaking up into

00:13:21.549 --> 00:13:26.789
Caption: parts and move the water and moon at

00:13:24.518 --> 00:13:28.989
Caption: different instances

00:13:26.789 --> 00:13:32.828
Caption: unfortunately I can&#39;t show you that life

00:13:28.989 --> 00:13:34.450
Caption: because you would be upset what I think

00:13:32.828 --> 00:13:36.398
Caption: is really interesting about device

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:39.790
Caption: orientation is we see the one in pink

00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:41.708
Caption: line augmented reality even games

00:13:39.789 --> 00:13:44.559
Caption: and these days will search through some

00:13:41.708 --> 00:13:49.809
Caption: UI effects more commonly parallax

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:51.880
Caption: effects but for me what I think is

00:13:49.809 --> 00:13:54.489
Caption: really exciting about it is it allows us

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:57.849
Caption: to create more interactive experience

00:13:54.489 --> 00:14:01.520
Caption: that shaped by the music right now a lot

00:13:57.849 --> 00:14:05.329
Caption: of our interactions are predetermined

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:07.399
Caption: you might click some letter but that&#39;s

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:10.040
Caption: going to happen exactly the same way for

00:14:07.398 --> 00:14:12.769
Caption: every single person that uses leather or

00:14:10.039 --> 00:14:15.559
Caption: our website device orientation that the

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:18.320
Caption: speech recognition API keeps uses the

00:14:15.559 --> 00:14:20.690
Caption: opportunity to change that experience

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:24.109
Caption: and to create something that&#39;s specific

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:26.989
Caption: just to them it gives them more control

00:14:24.109 --> 00:14:28.789
Caption: over the experience that they have it if

00:14:26.989 --> 00:14:30.559
Caption: you&#39;re doing branding sites or other

00:14:28.789 --> 00:14:31.880
Caption: training sites who you want them to age

00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:33.679
Caption: easy to have a different experience

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:38.419
Caption: these are the kinds of things are like

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:40.039
Caption: to do that if you an artist or a

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:41.869
Caption: designer and you want to express

00:14:40.039 --> 00:14:43.519
Caption: yourself differently to every single

00:14:41.869 --> 00:14:47.359
Caption: person that comes to your site you can

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.830
Caption: do that for these kinds of events and

00:14:47.359 --> 00:14:51.079
Caption: that brings me to the last one which is

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:53.540
Caption: my favorite I like to experiment with

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.760
Caption: the five senses a lot because I think

00:14:53.539 --> 00:14:58.479
Caption: that the works interesting and very

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:01.429
Caption: versatile of the senses on the web

00:14:58.479 --> 00:15:03.859
Caption: basically the ambient light sensor is a

00:15:01.429 --> 00:15:05.570
Caption: quarter detective that&#39;s used to sense

00:15:03.859 --> 00:15:11.179
Caption: the amount of ambient light that&#39;s in

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:13.278
Caption: the room it&#39;s pretty much found in

00:15:11.179 --> 00:15:15.399
Caption: everyone otherwise

00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:17.919
Caption: laptops happen

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.200
Caption: as a TVs as well you might see it

00:15:17.919 --> 00:15:22.088
Caption: commonly it&#39;s used to do something super

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.040
Caption: practical which is to give your screen

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:27.250
Caption: is Lorelei environments to take the

00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:30.009
Caption: string of your eyes TVs also use it for

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:34.080
Caption: similar reasons so that you can get see

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.080
Caption: black of blacks and that kind of stuff

00:15:36.059 --> 00:15:40.690
Caption: so much like the other examples that

00:15:38.919 --> 00:15:42.369
Caption: I&#39;ve shown you we needed a couple of

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:45.580
Caption: things and we don&#39;t need a lot to use

00:15:42.369 --> 00:15:50.169
Caption: the ambient light sensor first we need

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:51.910
Caption: the to granitic instance of the enemy of

00:15:50.169 --> 00:15:53.709
Caption: the light sense up and what that&#39;s going

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:55.409
Caption: to do is give us access to all of the

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:58.119
Caption: information about the light in the room

00:15:55.409 --> 00:16:01.119
Caption: we&#39;re going to need a couple of that

00:15:58.119 --> 00:16:04.390
Caption: handless specifically we need them on

00:16:01.119 --> 00:16:06.880
Caption: reading this isn&#39;t actually part of the

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:10.540
Caption: ambient light sensor api there is a

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.890
Caption: generic sense of api expect that a lot

00:16:10.539 --> 00:16:15.750
Caption: of the sensors that you can use on the

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:20.799
Caption: web use on bringing is part of that and

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:24.909
Caption: all it does is coal whatever a reading

00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:26.528
Caption: is taken the reading frequency for the

00:16:24.909 --> 00:16:28.588
Caption: any light sensor is determined by you

00:16:26.528 --> 00:16:30.940
Caption: you can possible to a property to that

00:16:28.588 --> 00:16:33.429
Caption: senses constructor and that will tell

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:36.159
Caption: you how many radians per second to take

00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:38.219
Caption: so the purposes of today we just take

00:16:36.159 --> 00:16:41.500
Caption: all the information it wants to give us

00:16:38.219 --> 00:16:45.489
Caption: the last thing we need is to return the

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:47.020
Caption: current light level of the room the only

00:16:45.489 --> 00:16:49.838
Caption: thing we need for that is the

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:52.179
Caption: illuminance property and this returns a

00:16:49.838 --> 00:16:55.599
Caption: Lux value which is just a number value

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:55.960
Caption: representing life but we really need to

00:16:55.599 --> 00:16:57.789
Caption: work

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:01.300
Caption: two months because you figure it out

00:16:57.789 --> 00:17:04.208
Caption: based on how bright it is or how dark it

00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:05.708
Caption: is this is on the quarry that we need

00:17:04.208 --> 00:17:08.530
Caption: you on it to do something with the

00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:10.920
Caption: ambient light sensor attention that we

Caption: create a new instance I&#39;m looking for a

00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:18.939
Caption: rating and then if it&#39;s less than 20 I&#39;m

00:17:16.838 --> 00:17:21.359

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:31.170
Caption: pretty dark in here

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:39.040
Caption: so let me show you an example that I

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:40.630
Caption: have made to this is my baby

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.510

Caption: favorite okay

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:52.890
Caption: so depending on how bright it is in the

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:57.030
Caption: room we depend up on with what you see I

00:17:52.890 --> 00:18:01.030
Caption: really love that I got to use my diamond

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:03.190
Caption: so you can do all sorts of things with

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:10.180
Caption: these fries again like I was saying

00:18:03.189 --> 00:18:15.579
Caption: before I&#39;ve also got this one for those

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:17.230
Caption: Victorian home I like to make an

00:18:15.579 --> 00:18:19.089
Caption: experiment with very good clumps and

00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:20.500
Caption: this is a very fun this was the first

00:18:19.089 --> 00:18:23.140
Caption: demo way that I ever made with an

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:25.689
Caption: ambient light sensor and what it does is

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:28.260
Caption: depending on how bright it is my trusty

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:30.779
Caption: Batman will depend on the

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:33.209
Caption: wait on the phone this is a coupon is

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:37.619
Caption: called tiny I like it because it really

00:18:33.209 --> 00:18:39.630
Caption: demonstrates like super brightness but

00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:43.920
Caption: what is really cool about this to me is

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:46.589
Caption: that with variable buns because you can

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:48.450
Caption: control the access and the style of the

00:18:46.589 --> 00:18:50.099
Caption: fonts depending on various types of

00:18:48.449 --> 00:18:53.429

Caption: that the user is in much like they

00:18:55.319 --> 00:18:58.799
Caption: demonstrate you might want to increase

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:02.880
Caption: the weight from your front to make it

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:06.780
Caption: easier than them to read in the instance

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:10.140
Caption: all of my Sun and Moon if you are going

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:14.820
Caption: to experience when you&#39;re writing a

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:19.290
Caption: story or but let&#39;s put imagine for a

00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:20.729
Caption: second you are writing a story about a

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.170
Caption: class and you&#39;re walking through the

00:19:20.729 --> 00:19:24.239
Caption: forest and it&#39;s in the middle of the day

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.680
Caption: so it&#39;s really stupid nice but then they

00:19:24.239 --> 00:19:28.319
Caption: come back and look at it at nighttime

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.700
Caption: and I tell spooky in this ass and it&#39;s

00:19:28.319 --> 00:19:32.399
Caption: really dumb and it&#39;s scary

00:19:29.699 --> 00:19:34.559
Caption: you can do this I mean you&#39;re uses

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.030
Caption: different experiences depending on the

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.390
Caption: situation that they&#39;re in and I think

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:42.119
Caption: that is the coolest thing because it&#39;s

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:44.550
Caption: on the market the web is like a level

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:46.589
Caption: above pre-money interactivity but this

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:53.820
Caption: kind of stuff lets us take it to a whole

00:19:46.589 --> 00:19:55.289
Caption: new place keeping up with oh sorry to

00:19:53.819 --> 00:19:57.179
Caption:  out what I wanted to say you start

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:59.609
Caption: being limited by what we can already do

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.500
Caption: on the web the web is a really really

00:19:59.609 --> 00:20:03.719
Caption: young place and there&#39;s still so much

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.000
Caption: for us to create and what I hate seeing

00:20:03.719 --> 00:20:08.099
Caption: is people going oh no ones that have

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.469
Caption: done that too it can&#39;t be done that&#39;s

00:20:08.099 --> 00:20:13.140
Caption: not true

00:20:09.469 --> 00:20:15.059
Caption: senses and API these are the opportunity

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.829
Caption: for us to create something new and

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.540
Caption: exciting that nobody has ever seen

00:20:16.829 --> 00:20:20.969
Caption: before and everyone in this room is

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:24.810
Caption: capable of doing that you don&#39;t need a

00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:26.760
Caption: lot of coin to get this going and you

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:28.530
Caption: don&#39;t need a lot of experience being in

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.329
Caption: developer in order to do that to be

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.969
Caption: honest I think most of it is just

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:35.699
Caption: creativity so there are a couple of

00:20:32.969 --> 00:20:39.059
Caption: examples I wanted to finish up on they

00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:40.919
Caption: combine these api&#39;s this uses the

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:43.440
Caption: ambient light sensor so if it&#39;s bright

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:53.460
Caption: in the group it will show a spotlight on

00:20:43.439 --> 00:20:56.359
Caption: the text I think he know might&#39;ve just

00:20:53.459 --> 00:20:56.359
Caption: crashed there we go

00:21:03.209 --> 00:21:08.428
Caption: there we go

00:21:05.189 --> 00:21:10.199
Caption: so it is doc and I&#39;m sorry if it&#39;s

00:21:08.428 --> 00:21:11.699
Caption: bright enough you get the spotlight and

00:21:10.199 --> 00:21:13.469
Caption: you&#39;ll get to read the secret message

00:21:11.699 --> 00:21:16.079
Caption: that said but you have to use the black

00:21:13.469 --> 00:21:17.908
Caption: screen taken in order to agree not so a

00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:19.949
Caption: basis being getting rid of a black and

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:23.129
Caption: it disappears so that&#39;s kind of sonic

00:21:19.949 --> 00:21:25.248
Caption: like puzzle games and it requires both

00:21:23.129 --> 00:21:28.080
Caption: inputs in order for you to play the top

00:21:25.249 --> 00:21:31.649
Caption: so another one that I made if you might

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:33.239
Caption: see on Twitter this is I just wanted to

00:21:31.649 --> 00:21:34.950

Caption: around but I wanted to show you it for

00:21:37.979 --> 00:21:48.539
Caption: real so that you believed me when I said

00:21:39.928 --> 00:21:49.829
Caption: it because I can show you the

00:21:48.538 --> 00:21:52.618
Caption: orientation on my laptop

00:21:49.829 --> 00:21:57.808
Caption: it doesn&#39;t come a gyroscope but I can&#39;t

00:21:52.619 --> 00:21:58.440
Caption: show you the beam so you turn the light

00:21:57.808 --> 00:22:01.378
Caption: on

00:21:58.439 --> 00:22:06.589

Caption: that you can see these I think in that

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:41.160
