  "description": "Software development is often thought of as a hard science, rather than a creative pursuit.\\n \\nIn this talk, I\u0027m planning to challenge that assumption. I\u0027ll be giving a practical demonstration of how to use the JavaScript canvas to create artistic visualizations on the fly, using real time data - including human brain activity. I\u0027ll also be discussing the creative process behind making art using unconventional tools, and how we can use some of these concepts to our advantage when working with technology. \\n \\nNo artistic (or technical) talent is required to enjoy! \\n\\nAlice is a Perth based software engineer, who\u0027s also a part time artist and part time stand-up comedian. I started mucking around with JavaScript visualisations when I was about 11, and never really stopped. Currently, I work at Readify as a developer/consultant, doing a mish-mash of fullstack things - currently, I\u0027m focusing on .NET development, but overall I like to stay language agnostic. In broad terms, the main focus of my work is making apps look nicer and do the things they\u0027re supposed to do."
