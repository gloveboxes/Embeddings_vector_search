Caption: fantastic so I&#39;m going to dive into some

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:11.639
Caption: of the questions that are coming up on

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.199
Caption: the panel and the first one that I can

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:18.119

Caption: uh an excellent reading voice if you

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:31.139
Caption: inherent or join a team that is not at

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:34.259
Caption: all diverse in terms of gender ethnicity

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.300
Caption: Etc what can you do to improve that you

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.619
Caption: can&#39;t just fire a bunch of people and

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:40.759
Caption: replace them

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:44.179
Caption: so what can you do instead

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:47.279
Caption: I think perhaps

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:48.600
Caption: I I&#39;m looking at everybody here I I know

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.100
Caption: we&#39;ve got a few people in leadership

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.619
Caption: positions

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.959
Caption: um Louise would you like to to have a

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:56.759
Caption: think about that one yeah I think it&#39;s

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:58.979
Caption: actually

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.979
Caption: um really an easy thing to think about

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:05.459
Caption: we&#39;re all different we&#39;re all diverse

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.160
Caption: anyway even if you even if your team is

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:09.959
Caption: full of white male middle-aged males

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.019
Caption: every one of them will have a different

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:15.779
Caption: background different

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:18.839
Caption: um priorities in their lives and you

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:21.119
Caption: just look for the diversity and you&#39;ll

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:23.880
Caption: see it

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:26.039
Caption: yeah that&#39;s a fantastic a fantastic

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.899
Caption: approach thanks Louise Tina do you have

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.059
Caption: some ideas

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:32.519
Caption: it&#39;s a it&#39;s a tricky one when you

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:35.100
Caption: inherit a team I think um it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:37.319
Caption: always easier to embed a culture that in

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.500
Caption: a team that you build from scratch but I

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.539
Caption: think setting the intent of having a

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.979
Caption: look around the table I think I agree

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.479
Caption: everyone has a different diverse

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.739
Caption: thinking and acknowledging that but also

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.059
Caption: acknowledging the perspectives that you

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:54.000
Caption: might not have around the table at that

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:55.799
Caption: point you know I think someone&#39;s changed

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.720
Caption: the phrase from culture fit to culture

00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:59.519
Caption: ad and I do really like that sense

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.440
Caption: because culture fit is expecting someone

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:04.500
Caption: to fit into your organization culture

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.940
Caption: art is respecting what someone can bring

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.160
Caption: to the table that you might not already

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.360
Caption: have and I think it&#39;s having a look at

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.759
Caption: that especially in technology because

00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:13.918
Caption: you want technology to be fit for

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.380
Caption: purpose for

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.300
Caption: um the demographic multiple demographic

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.739
Caption: you know um that you&#39;re targeting

00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:23.039
Caption: whether that&#39;s your end users or your

00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:24.539
Caption: customers or businesses so having

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.759
Caption: diverse teams in Tech is really

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:29.220
Caption: important to make sure that Tech fits

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.600
Caption: everyone&#39;s needs so so you know who

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.919
Caption: haven&#39;t you got at that table who

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.539
Caption: haven&#39;t you got as part of that Tech

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:38.220
Caption: Team and make a conscious effort to make

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.139
Caption: sure when you are hiring next that you

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.360
Caption: are actively looking for people that can

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:44.699
Caption: add to the people you already have I

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:46.079
Caption: think it&#39;s a longer process because now

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:47.759
Caption: you can&#39;t fire people and you shouldn&#39;t

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:50.279
Caption: fire people and because they are

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.500
Caption: obviously there on Merit so I think that

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:54.299
Caption: that&#39;s really important to

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.979
Caption: um State those values and that intent to

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:58.799
Caption: make sure you&#39;ve got that diverse pool

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:00.300
Caption: around the table and it soon becomes

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:02.119
Caption: clear if you do have people within your

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:03.899
Caption: team that don&#39;t buy into that concept

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:06.359
Caption: you&#39;ll find that they&#39;ll often

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:08.399
Caption: self-select out if they&#39;re not

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:10.500
Caption: um on board with going down that Journey

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:13.979
Caption: as well yeah thanks Tina a really

00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:04.679
Caption: West was very very happy to do that so

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.660
Caption: it has been for the past couple of years

00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:10.679
Caption: but it was not an official fully remote

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:14.339
Caption: role Moodle is my first uh pretty much

00:08:10.679 --> 00:08:15.839
Caption: remote like remote first role

00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:18.059
Caption: um so I suppose I&#39;m still kind of

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:19.919
Caption: figuring out the routine now that it

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:23.039
Caption: feels more permanent even though I was

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:25.319
Caption: effectively remote before

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:27.179
Caption: um I imagine it changes for everyone but

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:28.679
Caption: for me personally I end up getting up at

00:08:27.179 --> 00:08:30.019
Caption: about six because that&#39;s when my kids

00:08:28.679 --> 00:08:33.299
Caption: get up

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:36.299
Caption: so the way that it works for me is we

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:38.338
Caption: they watch TV we eat some breakfast then

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.419
Caption: my husband looks after them while I go

00:08:38.338 --> 00:08:41.218
Caption: get ready

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:43.260
Caption: and then get started I usually try to

00:08:41.218 --> 00:08:45.539
Caption: get started fairly early so I can finish

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.398
Caption: up early and have a bit more more time

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:49.320
Caption: with them

00:08:47.398 --> 00:08:51.239
Caption: um my day when I used to commute into

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.278
Caption: the city used to involve a lot more

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:54.479
Caption: getting dressed and thinking about what

00:08:53.278 --> 00:08:56.760
Caption: I was going to wear and putting on

00:08:54.479 --> 00:09:00.299
Caption: makeup and now I don&#39;t really have that

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:03.500
Caption: my my office is in my bedroom so I have

00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:03.500
Caption: an extremely short commute

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.338
Caption: thank you thank you I I do like that

00:09:07.018 --> 00:09:10.619
Caption: small commute I hope that you still

00:09:08.338 --> 00:09:14.338
Caption: manage to you know get some some me time

00:09:10.619 --> 00:09:19.018
Caption: in that commute a little bit

00:09:14.338 --> 00:09:21.479
Caption: um Ryan I was hoping to ask you uh about

00:09:19.018 --> 00:09:24.139
Caption: your experiences with inclusive

00:09:21.479 --> 00:09:24.139
Caption: workplaces

00:09:25.018 --> 00:09:28.559
Caption: okay

00:09:26.518 --> 00:09:30.419
Caption: um well I&#39;ve I was very fortunate to

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:31.919
Caption: find a very inclusive workplace

00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:34.139
Caption: um as someone with neurodiversity it

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:35.820
Caption: really comes down to finding a team

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.799
Caption: where they&#39;re willing to take advantage

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.580
Caption: of your strengths and find a workplace

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:42.000
Caption: where they&#39;re willing to make

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:44.700
Caption: accommodations so uh once more one is we

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.278
Caption: have open plan like most uh companies do

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.320
Caption: these days and I can&#39;t concentrate very

00:09:47.278 --> 00:09:51.539
Caption: well if someone&#39;s behind me so I always

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.919
Caption: get the desk at the end of the row and

00:09:51.539 --> 00:09:53.639
Caption: that may seem like a small thing to some

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:55.979
Caption: people

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.720
Caption: but for me that&#39;s I would be able to

00:09:55.979 --> 00:10:00.359
Caption: concentrate otherwise

00:09:57.719 --> 00:10:02.819
Caption: I also as I said have a principal

00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:05.099
Caption: engineer who has a deep understanding of

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.838
Caption: neurodiversity and he knows what

00:10:05.099 --> 00:10:08.579
Caption: projects to put on and where I can

00:10:06.838 --> 00:10:11.159
Caption: really Excel so for example I really

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:14.040
Caption: excel at depth and complexity

00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:16.919
Caption: thanks Ryan that&#39;s a I think fantastic

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:18.778
Caption: to have that support network in your

00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:20.518
Caption: workplace right that&#39;s a little bit

00:10:18.778 --> 00:10:21.958
Caption: about what what Tina was talking about

00:10:20.518 --> 00:10:24.778
Caption: there too

00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:27.719
Caption: uh the next question is how can you

00:10:24.778 --> 00:10:30.239
Caption: overcome the bias from a team that

00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:31.679
Caption: predominantly Works nine to five when

00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:35.940
Caption: you feel like you&#39;re the only one that

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:37.739
Caption: is working flexibly my goodness uh so do

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.739
Caption: we have some flexible workers on the

00:10:37.739 --> 00:10:42.239
Caption: panel yeah Tina Teresa do you want to

00:10:40.739 --> 00:10:44.880
Caption: maybe give us

00:10:42.239 --> 00:10:47.039
Caption: some of your thoughts around this

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.720
Caption: uh it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a tricky one I

00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:51.599
Caption: suppose I&#39;ve been lucky enough to work

00:10:48.719 --> 00:10:53.338
Caption: with um managers who have really

00:10:51.599 --> 00:10:55.018
Caption: exemplified this and I feel like that&#39;s

00:10:53.338 --> 00:10:57.958
Caption: that&#39;s really important to be

00:10:55.018 --> 00:10:59.639
Caption: demonstrating that they they have

00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.859
Caption: particular boundaries or they need that

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.660
Caption: flexibility and they&#39;re not afraid to to

00:11:01.859 --> 00:11:05.640
Caption: say so it&#39;s really important to have

00:11:03.659 --> 00:11:07.859
Caption: that then example for the team so you

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.859
Caption: can go okay it&#39;s all right for me to

00:11:07.859 --> 00:11:12.898
Caption: step out for a minute to do something or

00:11:10.859 --> 00:11:14.700
Caption: to work in you know a pattern which

00:11:12.898 --> 00:11:16.380
Caption: which makes more sense for me as long as

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.000
Caption: I&#39;m getting my work done I think it

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.000
Caption: requires a lot of

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.518
Caption: um a lot of trust

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.500
Caption: but uh I find that starting with small

00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:28.320
Caption: steps I suppose if you&#39;re the only

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.479
Caption: person doing it to create that trust to

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.578
Caption: show look sure I&#39;m not working a typical

00:11:30.479 --> 00:11:34.679
Caption: nine to five but I&#39;ve taken this small

00:11:32.578 --> 00:11:36.778
Caption: step the world hasn&#39;t fallen down

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:38.338
Caption: everything is still getting done and

00:11:36.778 --> 00:11:39.719
Caption: then you can continue taking those steps

00:11:38.338 --> 00:11:41.099
Caption: and then as you&#39;re creating that example

00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:43.979
Caption: then more people will be able to follow

00:11:41.099 --> 00:11:45.599
Caption: yeah yeah I think the example setting is

00:11:43.979 --> 00:11:48.059
Caption: a really good point there too razor it

00:11:45.599 --> 00:11:51.778
Caption: actually reminds me of my current

00:11:48.059 --> 00:11:55.320
Caption: manager who is really vocal about when

00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:56.820
Caption: he&#39;s taking time out to visit the kids

00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:01.078
Caption: or to pick up the kids or to do

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:03.898
Caption: something else and and that&#39;s an like a

00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:06.359
Caption: value that he portrays to let his team

00:12:03.898 --> 00:12:08.539
Caption: know that it is okay that you have a

00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:08.539
Caption: life

00:12:09.239 --> 00:12:15.838
Caption: we have another question here

00:12:12.778 --> 00:12:17.820
Caption: now it feels a little bit similar how

00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:20.338
Caption: can we create a flexible and inclusive

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.660
Caption: work environment for teams in which some

00:12:20.338 --> 00:12:23.338
Caption: team members are required in the office

00:12:21.659 --> 00:12:25.859
Caption: at certain times

00:12:23.338 --> 00:12:27.778
Caption: uh and others would be able to work from

00:12:25.859 --> 00:12:30.059
Caption: home more flexibly

00:12:27.778 --> 00:12:33.000
Caption: I am I&#39;m looking at Louise here actually

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:35.820
Caption: because we have some you know in-office

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.320
Caption: requirements at our work uh you know

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.440
Caption: what are some of the tools that we use

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.778
Caption: there to manage that yeah we um have

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.638
Caption: people that have have to work on site

00:12:42.778 --> 00:12:47.760
Caption: because of the nature of what they&#39;re

00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:50.159
Caption: working on and the information can&#39;t

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.760
Caption: leave the site so they can&#39;t work from

00:12:50.159 --> 00:12:56.638
Caption: home they work in the same team as

00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:01.979
Caption: people who don&#39;t have that restriction

00:12:56.638 --> 00:13:04.578
Caption: at at one or other sort of time so what

00:13:01.979 --> 00:13:07.799
Caption: we do is basically

00:13:04.578 --> 00:13:12.018
Caption: allow flexibility or

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:14.760
Caption: flexibility at any time and

00:13:12.018 --> 00:13:18.179
Caption: just push the boundary of what we call

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.739
Caption: flexibility basically so you know if

00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:22.138
Caption: they want to if they need to do

00:13:19.739 --> 00:13:23.299
Caption: something during the day they go and do

00:13:22.138 --> 00:13:26.338
Caption: whatever

00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:28.440
Caption: if they want to work whatever hours they

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:29.359
Caption: work whatever hours

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.239
Caption: um

00:13:29.359 --> 00:13:36.179
Caption: and if they&#39;ve got an arrangement where

00:13:33.239 --> 00:13:38.278
Caption: they normally work from home on say a

00:13:36.179 --> 00:13:40.859
Caption: Wednesday but this week they&#39;re working

00:13:38.278 --> 00:13:42.239
Caption: on classified on information that they

00:13:40.859 --> 00:13:46.320
Caption: can&#39;t take

00:13:42.239 --> 00:13:47.940
Caption: they um will just take that day another

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.299
Caption: day hmm

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:54.000
Caption: if they want so it&#39;s it&#39;s a matter of

00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:57.898
Caption: actually actually being flexible not

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.578
Caption: just using the words and having a policy

00:13:57.898 --> 00:14:01.919
Caption: of being flexible I think there&#39;s a

00:13:59.578 --> 00:14:06.000
Caption: difference between having a policy of

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:09.898
Caption: flexibility and having contracts that

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.099
Caption: people sign up to to be flexible

00:14:09.898 --> 00:14:16.380
Caption: um yeah absolutely

00:14:13.099 --> 00:14:17.699
Caption: being flexible yeah I like another point

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.619
Caption: that you made there as well which was

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.500
Caption: about the the team goal and keeping

00:14:19.619 --> 00:14:26.099
Caption: everybody is you know everybody is is

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:29.039
Caption: mindful of what that team goal is uh and

00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:31.559
Caption: as long as you recognize that overall

00:14:29.039 --> 00:14:34.018
Caption: you&#39;re achieving that goal together of

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:35.760
Caption: somebody is in the in the office when

00:14:34.018 --> 00:14:37.799
Caption: they need to be and and we can manage

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.559
Caption: that together that&#39;s a that&#39;s a really

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:42.778
Caption: good you know mindset to have that

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:43.979
Caption: you&#39;re not there alone you&#39;re not in

00:14:42.778 --> 00:14:48.359
Caption: this alone

00:14:43.979 --> 00:14:50.458
Caption: thank you I have another question here

00:14:48.359 --> 00:14:51.958
Caption: and thank you for some wonderful

00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:54.659
Caption: questions

00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:58.018
Caption: um I am trying to keep up with what

00:14:54.659 --> 00:15:01.799
Caption: comes at the top so please be aware uh

00:14:58.018 --> 00:15:03.719
Caption: bear with me uh this one comes in uh I

00:15:01.799 --> 00:15:05.880
Caption: am currently working remotely for a

00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:06.958
Caption: non-profit open source startup based in

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.760
Caption: Amsterdam

00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.138
Caption: and I&#39;m the only australia-based

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.660
Caption: employee

00:15:10.138 --> 00:15:15.778
Caption: how can I recommend or how do you

00:15:12.659 --> 00:15:18.539
Caption: recommend I ask to be included given

00:15:15.778 --> 00:15:20.638
Caption: everyone else is co-located

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:22.018
Caption: wow

00:15:20.638 --> 00:15:24.359
Caption: do you wanna

00:15:22.018 --> 00:15:26.518
Caption: I will try that&#39;s a big one and it&#39;s a

00:15:24.359 --> 00:15:27.958
Caption: complex one um and I I will help my

00:15:26.518 --> 00:15:31.799
Caption: hands up and say I haven&#39;t

00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:33.778
Caption: um managed International Teams so

00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:35.638
Caption: um but from

00:15:33.778 --> 00:15:37.078
Caption: my understanding is what I think the

00:15:35.638 --> 00:15:39.059
Caption: first thing you&#39;d need to look at is

00:15:37.078 --> 00:15:40.559
Caption: what does inclusion look like for you so

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:42.239
Caption: I think you need to become clearer of

00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:43.440
Caption: like what does that look like for some

00:15:42.239 --> 00:15:45.299
Caption: because otherwise they&#39;ll make

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.220
Caption: assumptions and they might put things in

00:15:45.299 --> 00:15:51.119
Caption: place that are detrimental inclusion for

00:15:47.219 --> 00:15:53.819
Caption: you may be jumping onto a teams chat at

00:15:51.119 --> 00:15:56.278
Caption: some point on a Friday to

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.660
Caption: um catch up with the team and have a

00:15:56.278 --> 00:15:59.458
Caption: quiz night or something for other people

00:15:57.659 --> 00:16:03.078
Caption: that might be super cringe and you&#39;d

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:06.419
Caption: hate it so I think being clear about how

00:16:03.078 --> 00:16:10.078
Caption: what how you what are the points that

00:16:06.419 --> 00:16:12.898
Caption: you need to feel included and then go to

00:16:10.078 --> 00:16:15.119
Caption: them and and state what they are like

00:16:12.898 --> 00:16:18.239
Caption: and it may be that it&#39;s a couple of

00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:18.859
Caption: smaller things around

00:16:18.239 --> 00:16:22.979
Caption: um

00:16:18.859 --> 00:16:25.260
Caption: uh being included on certain chats or

00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:28.320
Caption: um asking for information that might be

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.578
Caption: a watercolor conversation to be passed

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.518
Caption: on you know just think of the things

00:16:29.578 --> 00:16:34.799
Caption: that that are important to you and and

00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:35.880
Caption: kind of be clear about what they are I

00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:37.859
Caption: suppose when you&#39;re having those

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:42.059
Caption: conversations yeah

00:16:37.859 --> 00:16:42.059
Caption: thank you Tina uh

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.719
Caption: is it appropriate for a neurotypical

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.398
Caption: straight white man to be pushing for

00:16:48.719 --> 00:16:52.679
Caption: diversity and inclusivity within a

00:16:50.398 --> 00:16:57.359
Caption: workplace how can we best be allies to

00:16:52.679 --> 00:17:00.719
Caption: the cause love it I love it uh now

00:16:57.359 --> 00:17:03.419
Caption: none of our panelists are like right in

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:06.500
Caption: that in that area but Ryan

00:17:03.419 --> 00:17:06.500
Caption: I am the closest

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:12.780
Caption: um this is actually a conversation I&#39;ve

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:15.418
Caption: had a lot and

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.760
Caption: the answer is of course you can

00:17:15.418 --> 00:17:19.558
Caption: um but it&#39;s always good to make room for

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.078
Caption: lived experience voices

00:17:19.558 --> 00:17:25.198
Caption: uh it&#39;s also sometimes a part for

00:17:22.078 --> 00:17:27.239
Caption: straight white men to start the

00:17:25.198 --> 00:17:29.039
Caption: conversation because you can end up in a

00:17:27.239 --> 00:17:31.918
Caption: situation where let&#39;s say you want to

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.080
Caption: make your workplace more accepting of

00:17:31.918 --> 00:17:35.339
Caption: disability people where that if people

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:37.199
Caption: with disability or people with

00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:39.239
Caption: neurodivergence don&#39;t feel comfortable

00:17:37.199 --> 00:17:41.939
Caption: standing up so sometimes you need

00:17:39.239 --> 00:17:43.918
Caption: someone who&#39;s uh for like a better word

00:17:41.939 --> 00:17:47.099
Caption: mainstream

00:17:43.918 --> 00:17:48.959
Caption: um to stand up and be the voice first

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:50.819
Caption: and once those lived experience voices

00:17:48.959 --> 00:17:52.380
Caption: come in then you can start bringing them

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:54.058
Caption: into the conversation and start pulling

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.619
Caption: them forward if they want to and feel

00:17:54.058 --> 00:17:58.260
Caption: comfortable with it

00:17:55.619 --> 00:18:01.199
Caption: thank you that&#39;s at an excellent point

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.579
Caption: and I love how clear you were able to

00:18:01.199 --> 00:18:07.139
Caption: make that point which shows that you are

00:18:02.579 --> 00:18:10.739
Caption: a champion to the cause and a great Ally

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:13.919
Caption: uh the next question oh wow they just

00:18:10.739 --> 00:18:15.479
Caption: changed so you are dynamically choosing

00:18:13.918 --> 00:18:17.699
Caption: what comes up next and we&#39;re probably

00:18:15.479 --> 00:18:21.119
Caption: one or two questions until the end so

00:18:17.699 --> 00:18:23.519
Caption: get those votes in uh how do you balance

00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:26.959
Caption: the desire or the need for some staff to

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:29.880
Caption: fully work from home and with the other

00:18:26.959 --> 00:18:32.279
Caption: desire and needs of others for

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.619
Caption: face-to-face interactions particularly

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.640
Caption: for maybe people who feel isolated at

00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:37.020
Caption: home

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:40.320
Caption: uh

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:43.260
Caption: in particular in a single cohesive team

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:45.298
Caption: now Tina you spoke on this just a moment

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.859
Caption: ago I guess in in terms of how to feel

00:18:45.298 --> 00:18:48.239
Caption: included is there anything that you

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:49.798
Caption: would add

00:18:48.239 --> 00:18:52.500
Caption: um I&#39;d say that

00:18:49.798 --> 00:18:54.659
Caption: um our team are a combination of

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.520
Caption: extroverts and introverts I think so um

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.099
Caption: there&#39;s half of us just love working

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.539
Caption: from home and you know we we get drugged

00:18:59.099 --> 00:19:01.798
Caption: into the office every now and then the

00:19:00.538 --> 00:19:03.959
Caption: other half really missed that connection

00:19:01.798 --> 00:19:06.899
Caption: so I think it&#39;s it&#39;s acknowledging both

00:19:03.959 --> 00:19:10.199
Caption: and again being curious about what each

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:11.700
Caption: other needs to feel that connection

00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:13.260
Caption: um you know I think a couple of us could

00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:15.659
Caption: go two weeks with working with the odd

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.760
Caption: check-in and still feel motivated where

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:21.179
Caption: others don&#39;t so we&#39;ve come to the

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:23.520
Caption: conclusion that mostly on a Monday and

00:19:21.178 --> 00:19:24.719
Caption: always on a Monday but sometimes on a

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.940
Caption: Friday we will all be in the office

00:19:24.719 --> 00:19:28.619
Caption: together and that&#39;s our personal choice

00:19:26.939 --> 00:19:31.379
Caption: and that&#39;s what we discussed and worked

00:19:28.619 --> 00:19:35.339
Caption: for us as a compromise to have those

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:37.199
Caption: kind of um to accommodate for both the

00:19:35.339 --> 00:19:39.900
Caption: extroverts and the introverts across

00:19:37.199 --> 00:19:41.479
Caption: team yeah love it

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.039
Caption: thank you

00:19:41.479 --> 00:19:45.900
Caption: there have recently been experiments

00:19:44.038 --> 00:19:48.979
Caption: around the world are of the

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:52.500
Caption: effectiveness of the four day week

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:56.160
Caption: oh this is great do we have many people

00:19:52.500 --> 00:20:00.780
Caption: that work part-time with us today

00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:04.080
Caption: yeah a fair few a fair few uh do you see

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:06.059
Caption: it taking off in Perth I might go to

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:08.519
Caption: Tina and then maybe Teresa as somebody

00:20:06.058 --> 00:20:10.619
Caption: who does work part-time I&#39;m still on the

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.359
Caption: fence with it because I can see a lot of

00:20:10.619 --> 00:20:13.918
Caption: benefits but also knowing my own

00:20:12.359 --> 00:20:16.500
Caption: personality type I just think I would

00:20:13.918 --> 00:20:19.139
Caption: kill myself in those four days to still

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:21.719
Caption: get the same stuff done and I&#39;d probably

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:24.719
Caption: need that day just to recover from the

00:20:21.719 --> 00:20:27.119
Caption: four days I try to put in so I I don&#39;t

00:20:24.719 --> 00:20:30.298
Caption: know I for me jewelry is out still I&#39;d

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:34.439
Caption: like to see a lot more evidence of how

00:20:30.298 --> 00:20:37.380
Caption: successful in theory and it feels like

00:20:34.439 --> 00:20:39.418
Caption: it&#39;s going to to work but I can say

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.880
Caption: there may be some potential pitfalls

00:20:39.418 --> 00:20:43.259
Caption: with it so I I&#39;m I&#39;d like to see a few

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.640
Caption: more people experiment with it first

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:49.919
Caption: before and I commit to the team

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.719
Caption: Teresa so I&#39;ve been working four days a

00:20:49.918 --> 00:20:54.839
Caption: week since I started at Moodle and I

00:20:51.719 --> 00:20:57.000
Caption: love it working part-time is amazing

00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:59.159
Caption: um it was kind of helpful to me and that

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.339
Caption: I started to do that this as I started a

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.080
Caption: new job so I wasn&#39;t taking my five-day

00:21:02.339 --> 00:21:05.939
Caption: workload and attempting to squish it

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:09.000
Caption: into a four-day workload I was starting

00:21:05.939 --> 00:21:11.099
Caption: with an entirely new one so for me that

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.418
Caption: that really helped

00:21:11.099 --> 00:21:14.280
Caption: um it&#39;s a little bit different because

00:21:12.418 --> 00:21:15.959
Caption: I&#39;m electing to work four days a week

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.700
Caption: it&#39;s not a you know the four day work

00:21:15.959 --> 00:21:20.520
Caption: week is the idea that you would be paid

00:21:17.699 --> 00:21:22.380
Caption: your equivalent salary well that&#39;s the

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.239
Caption: main flavor of it I suppose but for that

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.678
Caption: for that four days

00:21:24.239 --> 00:21:27.000
Caption: um and and that is something which I

00:21:25.678 --> 00:21:29.399
Caption: assume would probably need a little bit

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.739
Caption: more experimentation and a bit more more

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.359
Caption: proof to really become more mainstream

00:21:31.739 --> 00:21:35.038
Caption: as Tina said yeah

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:37.558
Caption: awesome

00:21:35.038 --> 00:21:40.379
Caption: thank you

00:21:37.558 --> 00:21:42.479
Caption: the next question is that I find it

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.159
Caption: frustrating when leaders come back from

00:21:42.479 --> 00:21:46.500
Caption: parental leave and they want to work

00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:48.840
Caption: part-time only to be told that the role

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.500
Caption: isn&#39;t available in this capacity is this

00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:54.418
Caption: outdated thinking or can should the

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.760
Caption: business be more flexible with

00:21:54.418 --> 00:21:58.319
Caption: leadership roles so we have five minutes

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.320
Caption: left

00:21:58.319 --> 00:22:02.819
Caption: and this is this is a good one so uh we

00:22:01.319 --> 00:22:05.158
Caption: have a couple of parents up on the panel

00:22:02.819 --> 00:22:07.798
Caption: and Tina you have just come back from

00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:09.539
Caption: parental leave I have so I have a

00:22:07.798 --> 00:22:11.099
Caption: three-year-old who&#39;s in the wonderful

00:22:09.538 --> 00:22:12.298
Caption: child care that EDD put on thank you

00:22:11.099 --> 00:22:15.538
Caption: very much for that and I have a five

00:22:12.298 --> 00:22:18.839
Caption: week old which is a who&#39;s at home with

00:22:15.538 --> 00:22:20.699
Caption: his dad and I think that that is such an

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:22.678
Caption: outdated concept like completely

00:22:20.699 --> 00:22:24.298
Caption: outdated so I went to put my hand up

00:22:22.678 --> 00:22:25.859
Caption: when I worked to say I work part-time

00:22:24.298 --> 00:22:27.658
Caption: but I&#39;m technically still on Parental

00:22:25.859 --> 00:22:29.280
Caption: leave so I&#39;m not sure how that looks

00:22:27.659 --> 00:22:30.299
Caption: when I get back yet but

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.880
Caption: um for me I&#39;m a leader of two

00:22:30.298 --> 00:22:35.099
Caption: organizations so I lead valrose as a CEO

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.280
Caption: and I lead women in technology wa as a

00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:41.038
Caption: co-chair and they both take up my time

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.200
Caption: um I put in a lot of hours but I think

00:22:41.038 --> 00:22:45.719
Caption: to say that you can&#39;t come back as a

00:22:43.199 --> 00:22:47.459
Caption: leader flexibly is I think you&#39;re

00:22:45.719 --> 00:22:49.678
Caption: thinking more of a manager than a leader

00:22:47.459 --> 00:22:51.239
Caption: I think if you&#39;re a senior leader um

00:22:49.678 --> 00:22:53.819
Caption: it&#39;s a perfect opportunity to come back

00:22:51.239 --> 00:22:55.500
Caption: as flexibly because it&#39;s about being the

00:22:53.819 --> 00:22:57.178
Caption: driver of the culture it&#39;s about setting

00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:00.418
Caption: the strategy it&#39;s about trusting your

00:22:57.178 --> 00:23:01.918
Caption: team to to kind of execute and do and

00:23:00.418 --> 00:23:03.899
Caption: yeah you may need to get in and get in

00:23:01.918 --> 00:23:06.298
Caption: and get your hands dirty but if you

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.880
Caption: can&#39;t like you know I just think that

00:23:06.298 --> 00:23:10.199
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s an ideal role sometimes to be

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.699
Caption: able to do that and yes it can be high

00:23:10.199 --> 00:23:14.339
Caption: pressure

00:23:11.699 --> 00:23:16.380
Caption: um but yeah you should at that stage

00:23:14.339 --> 00:23:17.880
Caption: have really got a lot more comfortable

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.280
Caption: with setting your boundaries with with

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.900
Caption: managing your time and being able to do

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.840
Caption: that so I think it&#39;s an absolutely

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.460
Caption: outdated role outdated concept sorry not

00:23:24.839 --> 00:23:28.500
Caption: valid

00:23:26.459 --> 00:23:31.558
Caption: thank you Tina are there any other

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:35.599
Caption: people who would like to have a go at

00:23:31.558 --> 00:23:35.599
Caption: that question overall or shall I move on

00:23:35.839 --> 00:23:42.359
Caption: okay so our final question today is how

00:23:40.798 --> 00:23:45.599
Caption: can remote teams build strong

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:49.020

00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:53.058
Caption: do you have uh some remote people in

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:53.058
Caption: your team currently unofficially yes

00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:56.779
Caption: so because I work on a cloud team they

00:23:55.619 --> 00:24:00.380
Caption: really don&#39;t like being in the office

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.380
Caption: the main way

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:06.298
Caption: the main way I I see doing it is it&#39;s

00:24:04.558 --> 00:24:08.880
Caption: good to have a for lack of a better word

00:24:06.298 --> 00:24:10.500
Caption: meme culture in teams the other thing is

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.359
Caption: you don&#39;t need to be in person to have

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.939
Caption: coffee

Caption: of uh

00:24:16.918 --> 00:24:19.558

00:24:18.058 --> 00:24:21.599
Caption: comfortable joking around and battling

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:24.359

Caption: whatever I can&#39;t remember all of the

00:25:20.699 --> 00:25:27.678
Caption: things but I think it&#39;s a matter of

00:25:24.298 --> 00:25:32.339
Caption: thinking about what it is that makes

00:25:27.678 --> 00:25:35.219

00:25:35.219 --> 00:25:41.778
Caption: do that so using

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:45.479
Caption: um using your policy to to

00:25:41.779 --> 00:25:46.080
Caption: take away restrictions from people

00:25:45.479 --> 00:25:49.558
