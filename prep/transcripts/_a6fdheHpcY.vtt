Caption: um so the talk that I did the Meetup uh

00:04:42.359 --> 00:04:45.119
Caption: in Brisbane was called inclusive

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:47.638
Caption: storytelling with data and I only

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:49.199
Caption: focused on static charts or images of

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.639
Caption: charts so didn&#39;t talk about the

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.259
Caption: interaction at all and I made a big

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.419
Caption: promise that I would do a follow-up one

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.160
Caption: about Dynamic charts and here I am two

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.800
Caption: years later

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.300
Caption: and so this is a bit of a reprise of

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:06.059
Caption: that talk and I&#39;m very very excited

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:10.500
Caption: uh I think I have internet but

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:13.139
Caption: um so the big kind of trigger for this

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.699
Caption: topic and the big light bulb moment for

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.679
Caption: me was reading a book called

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.160
Caption: storytelling with data

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:24.600
Caption: um by Cole nospoma naflick amazing

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.839
Caption: amazing database uh expert who worked at

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.100
Caption: Google and ended up her whole job being

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.679
Caption: teaching people how to communicate

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.300
Caption: better with data at Google

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:36.179
Caption: and I really really recommend reading

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:38.159
Caption: that book before anything else uh really

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:41.699
Caption: really awesome book on the kind of

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.800
Caption: basics of design and data communication

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.720
Caption: and um

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:47.579
Caption: if you want to make accessible data

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.259
Caption: visualizations as that book will mention

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:50.179
Caption: you do need to learn a little bit about

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.919
Caption: design

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:55.799
Caption: a well-designed data visualization is

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:58.320
Caption: easy to interpret and understand and

00:05:55.799 --> 00:06:00.500
Caption: good design takes into the account

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.759
Caption: it takes into account the needs of users

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.139
Caption: and some of those users will have

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.339
Caption: disabilities

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.880
Caption: and

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:09.600
Caption: um

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.300
Caption: so accessible design is inclusive design

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.880
Caption: an inclusive design is the key to good

00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:17.279
Caption: design where it considers not only

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.559
Caption: disability but language culture gender

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:21.359
Caption: age and other forms of human difference

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:22.319
Caption: if you haven&#39;t heard of inclusive design

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:24.478
Caption: before

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.459
Caption: uh there&#39;s a

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.500
Caption: um very often uh very very popular

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:29.699
Caption: diagram that I&#39;ve got on the screen at

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.440
Caption: the moment

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.600
Caption: um about inclusive design from Microsoft

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.699
Caption: you may have seen it before or you may

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.220
Caption: have known of it before so it&#39;s a table

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.679
Caption: with three column and four rows and the

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.959
Caption: columns refer to examples of permanent

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:45.299
Caption: temporary and situational disability

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:47.880
Caption: and the rows refer to sensors such as

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:50.819
Caption: human sensors such as motor Vision

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.619
Caption: hearing and speech so an example in the

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:54.419
Caption: in the diagram is a permanent mode of

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:55.500
Caption: disability is maybe an amputee with a

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:57.600
Caption: missing arm

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.639
Caption: and while a temporary motor disability

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.819
Caption: is having a broken arm and a situational

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:04.500
Caption: disability is perhaps a parent carrying

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:06.119
Caption: a newborn

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.339
Caption: um and you can come up with your own

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:09.539
Caption: examples for the others the goal of this

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:11.519
Caption: graphic is to illustrate that if

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:14.339
Caption: disability is viewed as a mismatch

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:16.019
Caption: between a person that disabilities views

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:17.399
Caption: can be viewed as a mismatch between a

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:19.319
Caption: person and their environment the

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:21.239
Caption: environment is actually just disabling

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:24.000
Caption: the person

00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:25.918
Caption: um and designing for disability actually

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.579
Caption: benefits everybody

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:28.639
Caption: um

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:31.500
Caption: so to design a chart accessibly

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:34.259
Caption: accessibly will help your database be

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.399
Caption: understood by more and more people if

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:36.779
Caption: you want to learn more about inclusive

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:39.598

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:41.339
Caption: Microsoft&#39;s inclusive design toolkit and

00:07:39.598 --> 00:07:43.739
Caption: I believe they are also a sponsor of DDD

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:47.220
Caption: Perth

00:07:43.739 --> 00:07:48.899
Caption: so uh one thing I do want to note and a

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.880
Caption: common misconception if you are new to

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:53.279
Caption: accessibility is accessibility is not

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.819
Caption: one size fits all it&#39;s not trying to

00:07:53.279 --> 00:08:00.000
Caption: kind of craft everyone to go through the

00:07:56.819 --> 00:08:02.699
Caption: same UI flow

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.319
Caption: um it is providing multiple Pathways

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:09.959
Caption: that not every user might kind of take

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:11.959
Caption: so an example is

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:11.959
Caption: um

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.500
Caption: brain freeze

00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:19.319
Caption: um so for for the example of data

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.479
Caption: visualizations uh folks might prefer

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:25.440
Caption: that visual folks might prefer to look

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:27.839
Caption: at a chart or a data visualization and

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.220
Caption: maybe people who prefer looking at the

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:31.139
Caption: data and understanding the data would

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.539
Caption: prefer to have a table presented to them

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:35.820
Caption: instead so that they can do their own

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.440
Caption: analysis on the data so that is a that

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.059
Caption: is an example of being flexible and

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.520
Caption: providing multiple Pathways for the same

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:43.158
Caption: outcome you want people to understand or

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.820
Caption: to

00:08:43.158 --> 00:08:46.820
Caption: consume your data

00:08:47.419 --> 00:08:53.398
Caption: and so uh one of the big problems is

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:55.380
Caption: that um

00:08:53.398 --> 00:08:56.580
Caption: and and the reason for kind of kicking

00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.898
Caption: off this

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:02.580
Caption: talk and this uh kind of Meetup Group in

00:09:00.898 --> 00:09:05.640
Caption: data visualization is there&#39;s not a

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:08.220
Caption: whole lot of resources out there to uh

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:11.519
Caption: or there wasn&#39;t there is now actually

00:09:08.219 --> 00:09:14.939
Caption: um to learn how to make the interactive

00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:17.760
Caption: Dynamic database accessible and what I

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:21.299
Caption: mean by that is uh most data

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.580
Caption: visualizations uh able to be accessed

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:25.859
Caption: using a mouse and

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.600
Caption: um and for sighted folks but if it when

00:09:25.859 --> 00:09:29.299
Caption: it comes down to people who cannot use a

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:32.599
Caption: mouse they only use the keyboard maybe

00:09:29.299 --> 00:09:36.659
Caption: or people who use screen readers

00:09:32.599 --> 00:09:38.159
Caption: they are not able to look at the data at

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:40.679
Caption: all

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:42.179
Caption: um and so I have a video from

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:45.059
Caption: uh

00:09:42.179 --> 00:09:46.919
Caption: a a talk kind of on a 101 data

00:09:45.059 --> 00:09:49.679
Caption: visualization just to show an example

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:51.299
Caption: and hopefully it plays uh of what it is

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:54.778
Caption: like for a screen reader user to access

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:57.778
Caption: a an inaccessible chart so

00:09:54.778 --> 00:10:00.179
Caption: um a lot of this blew up because uh

00:09:57.778 --> 00:10:02.119
Caption: when when kind of covered

00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:05.760
Caption: began there was also the U.S election

00:10:02.119 --> 00:10:08.398
Caption: and so there was an incredible amount of

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.179
Caption: data visualization and especially kind

00:10:08.398 --> 00:10:11.039
Caption: of

00:10:09.179 --> 00:10:12.838
Caption: um the advancements and also data

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:16.500
Caption: visualization libraries kind of anybody

00:10:12.838 --> 00:10:19.380
Caption: could kind of put together a um a really

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.239
Caption: shiny looking data visualization

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.039
Caption: um or something that&#39;s super interactive

00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:24.599
Caption: and super cool which they were but

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.320
Caption: unfortunately

00:10:24.599 --> 00:10:26.940
Caption: um

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.119
Caption: they want the best experience for

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.119
Caption: everyone

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.080
Caption: on internet

00:10:34.739 --> 00:10:39.958
Caption: something else that&#39;s more technical is

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.459
Caption: making it work for a screen reader

00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:44.219
Caption: screen readers such as for example

00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:46.260
Caption: voiceover for Mac they will read what&#39;s

00:10:44.219 --> 00:10:48.239
Caption: displayed on the page and unless you&#39;re

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.458
Caption: using a database library that already

00:10:48.239 --> 00:10:52.440
Caption: puts a lot of focus in screen reader

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:54.539
Caption: accessibility you will have to do quite

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.700
Caption: a bit of technical work there yourself

00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:59.219
Caption: let&#39;s take a look at an example

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.320
Caption: this is from Fox News

00:10:59.219 --> 00:11:03.479
Caption: during the elections they had a page

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.979
Caption: live updated as the Electoral College

00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:07.260
Caption: for its given

00:11:04.979 --> 00:11:10.260
Caption: and the progress bar underneath

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.299
Caption: would show how many votes from each

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.398
Caption: State&#39;s each of the candidates had

00:11:12.299 --> 00:11:17.458
Caption: gathered already and how close they were

00:11:14.398 --> 00:11:18.299
Caption: to getting the 270 that they needed to

00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:19.859
Caption: win

00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:21.539
Caption: however

00:11:19.859 --> 00:11:23.760
Caption: let&#39;s listen to what it&#39;s like for a

00:11:21.539 --> 00:11:27.838
Caption: screen reader

00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:56.699
Caption: three votes I think you get the idea

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.278
Caption: that goes on for another five minutes so

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.518
Caption: I&#39;m not going to um keep that one

00:11:59.278 --> 00:12:01.518
Caption: playing

00:12:02.578 --> 00:12:05.699
Caption: oh

00:12:04.018 --> 00:12:08.099
Caption: apologies

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:11.880
Caption: okay

00:12:08.099 --> 00:12:14.099
Caption: um so as you could probably hear that

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.859
Caption: was not a terribly good experience for

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:20.159
Caption: screen reader users uh it it was even

00:12:16.859 --> 00:12:21.419
Caption: kind of lucky that that particular data

00:12:20.159 --> 00:12:23.819
Caption: visualization or that website actually

00:12:21.419 --> 00:12:27.000
Caption: had some labels on the data so that you

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:29.760
Caption: could hear votes votes votes how many

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.700
Caption: votes um often it&#39;s just image image

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.600
Caption: image image image or something else

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.919
Caption: um

00:12:33.599 --> 00:12:38.299
Caption: so

00:12:34.919 --> 00:12:41.518
Caption: how do we make an accessible HTML chart

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:42.838
Caption: so luckily in the last few years one

00:12:41.518 --> 00:12:44.458
Caption: particular company has made it really

00:12:42.838 --> 00:12:48.659
Caption: really easy

00:12:44.458 --> 00:12:51.179
Caption: um so the uh the advice that I have is

00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:53.578
Caption: uh use the high charts JavaScript

00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:55.138
Caption: charting library and add a couple of

00:12:53.578 --> 00:12:57.419
Caption: accessibility modules that they include

00:12:55.138 --> 00:12:59.659
Caption: in there and that&#39;s it that&#39;s the end of

00:12:57.419 --> 00:12:59.659
Caption: my talk

00:13:00.659 --> 00:13:04.379
Caption: um

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:06.778
Caption: uh but Jokes Aside unless you have a

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.859
Caption: really really giant development team you

00:13:06.778 --> 00:13:09.898
Caption: probably don&#39;t want to be writing your

00:13:07.859 --> 00:13:11.880
Caption: own database Library unless you really

00:13:09.898 --> 00:13:14.219
Caption: need to especially if you want to make

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.799
Caption: it accessible it is quite easy to kind

00:13:14.219 --> 00:13:18.239
Caption: of get it to the mouse hover point where

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:21.119
Caption: you can have tool tips showing on Mouse

00:13:18.239 --> 00:13:23.458
Caption: hover but there is quite a bit more work

00:13:21.119 --> 00:13:25.440
Caption: to do after that

00:13:23.458 --> 00:13:26.880
Caption: um and high charts isn&#39;t the only

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.159
Caption: Library out there but is one of the most

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.200
Caption: fully featured and uh best developer

00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:32.578
Caption: experiences I&#39;ve found are the libraries

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.359
Caption: that you may have heard of such as am

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:37.559
Caption: charts uh couldn&#39;t quite uh work out as

00:13:36.359 --> 00:13:40.700
Caption: easily how to get the accessibility

00:13:37.559 --> 00:13:40.700
Caption: module going in that

00:13:41.578 --> 00:13:43.699
Caption: um

00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:49.078
Caption: and uh

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.220
Caption: so a few years ago I built a dynamic

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:54.320
Caption: chart when I worked for a Logging

00:13:50.219 --> 00:13:56.879
Caption: company so on the screen I have a a

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.500
Caption: column chart there and this chart is to

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.559
Caption: show effective log retention how

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:04.919
Caption: effective log retention policies are

00:14:01.559 --> 00:14:06.838
Caption: um uh on keeping kind of disk space to a

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:10.138
Caption: maintainable level

00:14:06.838 --> 00:14:11.278
Caption: um so uh it was a column chart that

00:14:10.138 --> 00:14:12.719
Caption: ended up being at least keyboard

00:14:11.278 --> 00:14:15.119
Caption: accessible

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:17.099
Caption: um and uh this was kind of working with

00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:18.599
Caption: the knowledge I I had at the time I was

00:14:17.099 --> 00:14:20.039
Caption: still learning and still trying to

00:14:18.599 --> 00:14:21.359
Caption: understand what makes an accessible data

00:14:20.039 --> 00:14:23.239
Caption: visualization

00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:26.039
Caption: um a dynamic one

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:28.979
Caption: and I had a really good crack in making

00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:30.299
Caption: it screen reader accessible but it was

00:14:28.979 --> 00:14:31.500
Caption: probably a horrendous experience for

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:34.380
Caption: them

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.599
Caption: um similar to kind of the uh video that

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:39.059
Caption: I just played and unfortunately it

00:14:36.599 --> 00:14:40.500
Caption: wasn&#39;t tested with real users which is

00:14:39.059 --> 00:14:41.958
Caption: really really important and and

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:47.219
Caption: absolutely

00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:48.898
Caption: must must do so on the screen as I think

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:50.458
Caption: most of you or all of you cannot see

00:14:48.898 --> 00:14:55.138
Caption: because it&#39;s tiny font

00:14:50.458 --> 00:14:58.799
Caption: um is the accessibility tree of the

00:14:55.138 --> 00:15:02.039
Caption: chart that I just displayed and I

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:04.320
Caption: actually can&#39;t even read it uh

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:06.299
Caption: and what I&#39;m trying to demonstrate in

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.458
Caption: this screenshot is

00:15:06.299 --> 00:15:11.159
Caption: um that I added Aria labels to each of

00:15:08.458 --> 00:15:14.638
Caption: those bars or each of those columns and

00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:17.940
Caption: it was really repetitive the first uh

00:15:14.638 --> 00:15:19.578
Caption: the first part of the a label was the

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:22.198
Caption: same for every single

00:15:19.578 --> 00:15:24.419
Caption: bar and so for a screen reader user

00:15:22.198 --> 00:15:27.359
Caption: who&#39;s trying to cycle through all of the

00:15:24.419 --> 00:15:30.359
Caption: data in the chart they will just hear

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:34.018
Caption: the same first five words for the

00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:35.880
Caption: um for the chart and then only the uh

00:15:34.018 --> 00:15:38.760
Caption: only the numbers changed at the very end

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.880
Caption: of the sentence so uh past me was trying

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:44.100
Caption: to be descriptive and but unfortunately

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.838
Caption: it made it quite a bad experience so

00:15:44.099 --> 00:15:47.940
Caption: that&#39;s one example of why it&#39;s so

00:15:45.838 --> 00:15:49.859
Caption: important to test with actual screen

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.760
Caption: reader users

00:15:49.859 --> 00:15:53.398
Caption: um

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.540
Caption: apologies if the internet is going to

00:15:53.398 --> 00:15:55.198
Caption: load

00:15:54.539 --> 00:15:59.119
Caption: um

00:15:55.198 --> 00:16:01.078
Caption: so alternatively so I did that in d3.js

00:15:59.119 --> 00:16:03.559
Caption: I&#39;ve completely forgotten how to use

00:16:01.078 --> 00:16:05.820
Caption: d3.js and it keeps happening every time

00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:09.479
Caption: d3js is like a library that helps you

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:10.078
Caption: build svgs easier

00:16:09.479 --> 00:16:12.000
Caption: um

00:16:10.078 --> 00:16:13.559
Caption: so alternatively a bunch of research

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.659
Caption: user testing has gone into the high

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:17.820
Caption: charts products and uh the head of

00:16:15.659 --> 00:16:19.078
Caption: accessibility and another co-worker of

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.419
Caption: his actually joined the database

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:23.518
Caption: accessibility group that we um virtually

00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:25.739
Caption: met up with once a month and uh they

00:16:23.518 --> 00:16:26.698
Caption: were so cool so I&#39;m a huge fan

00:16:25.739 --> 00:16:30.000
Caption: um

00:16:26.698 --> 00:16:31.919
Caption: and so they&#39;ve done a bunch of work so

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.479
Caption: that you don&#39;t have to so if you&#39;re not

00:16:31.919 --> 00:16:35.338
Caption: already sold on using High charts it&#39;s

00:16:33.479 --> 00:16:36.479
Caption: really customizable they haven&#39;t paid me

00:16:35.338 --> 00:16:37.919
Caption: for this

00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:39.958
Caption: um it&#39;s just they&#39;ve made it really

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:42.179
Caption: really easy and nice experience and and

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:44.518
Caption: it&#39;s pretty accessible still do

00:16:42.179 --> 00:16:45.239
Caption: usability testing

00:16:44.518 --> 00:16:47.278
Caption: um

00:16:45.239 --> 00:16:48.838
Caption: uh so

00:16:47.278 --> 00:16:49.979
Caption: you do still have to do some

00:16:48.838 --> 00:16:52.698
Caption: configuration but you don&#39;t have to

00:16:49.979 --> 00:16:52.698
Caption: build it from scratch

00:16:53.219 --> 00:16:57.500
Caption: all right so let&#39;s make a graph

00:16:58.018 --> 00:17:04.558
Caption: um but uh first I wanted to talk to you

00:17:01.078 --> 00:17:07.020
Caption: uh quickly just just through graphs that

00:17:04.558 --> 00:17:08.880
Caption: are images just to start off with

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.239
Caption: um and then we&#39;ll move on into HTML

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.058
Caption: charts so on the screen I have an image

00:17:12.239 --> 00:17:16.739
Caption: of a line graph

00:17:14.058 --> 00:17:18.198
Caption: there&#39;s three lines three data series or

00:17:16.739 --> 00:17:20.400
Caption: three lines on it

00:17:18.198 --> 00:17:22.739
Caption: you might be able to see that there&#39;s

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.119
Caption: jaws nvda and voiceover so we&#39;re talking

00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:27.359
Caption: about three different types of screen

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:28.859
Caption: readers and there&#39;s a y-axis and an X

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:30.119
Caption: asset access and you&#39;re probably already

00:17:28.859 --> 00:17:32.520
Caption: picking up that there are a few things

00:17:30.119 --> 00:17:33.959
Caption: missing from this chart if you are into

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.099
Caption: Data

00:17:33.959 --> 00:17:36.599
Caption: um

00:17:35.099 --> 00:17:38.579
Caption: so

00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:41.339
Caption: um there are a few steps to kind of

00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:43.918
Caption: begin with to make the chart accessible

00:17:41.339 --> 00:17:45.538
Caption: so a little quick checklist of checks

00:17:43.918 --> 00:17:47.939
Caption: that we can do for a static image which

00:17:45.538 --> 00:17:49.558
Caption: also kind of carry on to Dynamic charts

00:17:47.939 --> 00:17:50.879
Caption: or HTML charts so we&#39;ve got to get these

00:17:49.558 --> 00:17:52.099
Caption: ones right first and then we can make it

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.558
Caption: Interactive

00:17:52.099 --> 00:17:57.479
Caption: so I&#39;ve kind of split it into three

00:17:55.558 --> 00:18:00.119
Caption: three different categories the first

00:17:57.479 --> 00:18:02.459
Caption: test is content and I usually do this

00:18:00.119 --> 00:18:03.780
Caption: first because thinking about the content

00:18:02.459 --> 00:18:06.000
Caption: and how to make the content accessible

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.799
Caption: and Cole talks a lot about this in the

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.199
Caption: storytelling we&#39;ve done a book you might

00:18:07.798 --> 00:18:11.579
Caption: end up changing the chart completely and

00:18:10.199 --> 00:18:13.019
Caption: you don&#39;t want to kind of work on all

00:18:11.579 --> 00:18:15.119
Caption: the other accessibility parts of the

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.520
Caption: chart and then end up changing the chart

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:19.439
Caption: and then having to go through and work

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.299
Caption: through all the rest of the visual and

00:18:19.439 --> 00:18:23.038
Caption: non-visual accessibility needs of the

00:18:21.298 --> 00:18:23.699
Caption: chart after that

00:18:23.038 --> 00:18:27.239
Caption: um

00:18:23.699 --> 00:18:30.239
Caption: so making sure that there&#39;s a title a

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:33.298
Caption: descriptive title even and axes are

00:18:30.239 --> 00:18:35.160
Caption: labeled appropriately and one thing uh

00:18:33.298 --> 00:18:37.019
Caption: is number formatting making it a nice

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.020
Caption: experience putting commas making sure

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.760
Caption: units are correct making the chart and

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.520
Caption: reducing the cognitive load for anyone

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.320
Caption: looking or

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.020
Caption: inspecting the chart the next test after

00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:51.599
Caption: that is visual testing so the things

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.099
Caption: that probably were all uh kind of think

00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:54.839
Caption: of first when we think of accessibility

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:58.739
Caption: of charts is contrast making sure the

00:18:54.839 --> 00:19:01.140
Caption: contrast is okay meets um the kind of uh

00:18:58.739 --> 00:19:02.459
Caption: usual requirements if you&#39;re familiar

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.280
Caption: with wikang or the web content

00:19:02.459 --> 00:19:07.319
Caption: accessibility guidelines but in in

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.679
Caption: summary it just has to kind of not be

00:19:07.319 --> 00:19:11.699
Caption: bright yellow or a really light pastel

00:19:10.678 --> 00:19:14.339
Caption: um

00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:16.319
Caption: uh and um making sure that we&#39;re not

00:19:14.339 --> 00:19:18.298
Caption: relying solely on color or giving the

00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:20.279
Caption: option to be able to you know add

00:19:18.298 --> 00:19:22.918
Caption: patterns to the Chart

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.440
Caption: um uh that&#39;s that alternative Pathways

00:19:22.918 --> 00:19:27.599
Caption: again if someone can use color then

00:19:25.439 --> 00:19:29.159
Caption: um that&#39;s that&#39;s fine but making sure

00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:31.079
Caption: that we provide the other the other

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.059
Caption: alternative

00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:34.798
Caption: um and and a font is a big one is two

00:19:33.058 --> 00:19:37.798
Caption: making sure that the font is legible not

00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:41.159
Caption: using like very fancy Arty fonts uh Sans

00:19:37.798 --> 00:19:42.839
Caption: serif or the uh the Ariel or helvetica

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.260
Caption: or anything that doesn&#39;t have the little

00:19:42.839 --> 00:19:49.979
Caption: extra bits on on parts of the font

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:52.380
Caption: um uh uh more accessible to folks who

00:19:49.979 --> 00:19:53.119
Caption: may have dyslexia

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.339
Caption: um

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:59.339
Caption: and uh and finally non-visual making

00:19:56.339 --> 00:20:01.678
Caption: sure that the chart has alternative text

00:19:59.339 --> 00:20:03.178
Caption: or an image description you might be

00:20:01.678 --> 00:20:06.619
Caption: familiar with this and HTML is adding

00:20:03.178 --> 00:20:06.619
Caption: the alt tag on the image element

00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:12.599
Caption: so

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.479
Caption: um

00:20:12.599 --> 00:20:18.239
Caption: writing so one of the hardest bits is

00:20:15.479 --> 00:20:21.839
Caption: writing alt text for charts but someone

00:20:18.239 --> 00:20:25.140
Caption: in the databiz community has written and

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:27.058
Caption: it incredibly awesome article on just

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.039
Caption: giving a simple template to be able to

00:20:27.058 --> 00:20:30.558
Caption: just take this template fill in what you

00:20:29.038 --> 00:20:33.979
Caption: need and that&#39;s a really really good

00:20:30.558 --> 00:20:36.538
Caption: description of an image of a chart

00:20:33.979 --> 00:20:39.359
Caption: and usually folks are including images

00:20:36.538 --> 00:20:42.000
Caption: on charts to complement an article that

00:20:39.359 --> 00:20:43.199
Caption: might be to support some sort of factual

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Caption: point that they are making in that

00:20:43.199 --> 00:20:46.619
Caption: article and the chart is not really

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.160
Caption: something that people are actually using

00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:52.918
Caption: to kind of explore or get data from

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.840
Caption: um so describing what the chart is and

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:56.519
Caption: uh something that is really really

00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:58.739
Caption: important is making sure to have a link

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.020
Caption: to the data source that alternative

00:20:58.739 --> 00:21:03.239
Caption: Pathways again so a download to a CSV

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.979
Caption: file or maybe a HTML table on another

00:21:03.239 --> 00:21:07.760
Caption: page

00:21:04.979 --> 00:21:11.640
Caption: um so that if a person is not able to

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:14.280
Caption: pass the visual chart they can go and

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.900
Caption: inspect the data themselves

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.160
Caption: if they would like

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.559
Caption: so

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.239
Caption: um even if you have an interactive chart

00:21:19.558 --> 00:21:23.099
Caption: uh

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:24.780
Caption: if you&#39;re not quite sure how to make it

00:21:23.099 --> 00:21:27.119
Caption: accessible with all the keyboard and all

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.619
Caption: the JavaScript and all the screen reader

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:31.739
Caption: stuff what you can do is kind of wrap

00:21:28.619 --> 00:21:35.760
Caption: this chart wrap the chart in an image

00:21:31.739 --> 00:21:37.400
Caption: um image role and give it alt text and

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.599
Caption: then make sure that you have that

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.820
Caption: absolutely make sure that you have that

00:21:39.599 --> 00:21:43.859
Caption: link to the data so that they can

00:21:41.819 --> 00:21:45.859
Caption: download it or inspect it in a table so

00:21:43.859 --> 00:21:48.418
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s a great start if

00:21:45.859 --> 00:21:50.520
Caption: you&#39;re not quite sure how to how to make

00:21:48.418 --> 00:21:52.880
Caption: it accessible in terms of screen readers

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.880
Caption: and things

00:21:53.459 --> 00:21:58.020
Caption: all right and uh my favorite reminder is

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.299
Caption: if you are tweeting

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:02.700
Caption: um and you&#39;re not aware that you can add

00:22:00.298 --> 00:22:04.319
Caption: alternative texts to your DVD Perth

00:22:02.699 --> 00:22:07.380
Caption: tweets

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:08.279
Caption: um I uh don&#39;t quite remember how to do

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.900
Caption: it

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.479
Caption: um but I think when you take a photo

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.820
Caption: there&#39;s a little alt button somewhere on

00:22:12.479 --> 00:22:16.280
Caption: your phone and you can click on that and

00:22:14.819 --> 00:22:20.699
Caption: you can

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:22.440
Caption: describe your image as well so uh you

00:22:20.699 --> 00:22:26.099
Caption: may have seen that Twitter has also

00:22:22.439 --> 00:22:27.899
Caption: brought out the alt button feature so

00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:30.058
Caption: that you can inspect other people&#39;s alt

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.619
Caption: text so if you are new to writing alt

00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:33.538
Caption: text it is actually not that easy it

00:22:31.619 --> 00:22:35.760
Caption: takes a bit of practice

00:22:33.538 --> 00:22:37.558
Caption: um you can kind of cheat and look at

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.058
Caption: what other people are describing the

00:22:37.558 --> 00:22:40.619
Caption: images as

00:22:39.058 --> 00:22:43.619
Caption: um on Twitter without having to you know

00:22:40.619 --> 00:22:46.760
Caption: switch on your screen reader and and try

00:22:43.619 --> 00:22:46.760
Caption: to inspect the image that way

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:54.500
Caption: all right back to database so

00:22:50.099 --> 00:22:54.500
Caption: how to make accessible HTML charts

00:22:54.659 --> 00:22:57.360
Caption: um

00:22:55.439 --> 00:22:58.558
Caption: so what if we can&#39;t make do with an

00:22:57.359 --> 00:23:01.339
Caption: image

00:22:58.558 --> 00:23:01.339
Caption: uh

00:23:01.619 --> 00:23:05.579
Caption: so for example most people here probably

00:23:04.558 --> 00:23:08.158
Caption: have

00:23:05.579 --> 00:23:09.359
Caption: a banking or either finance app this is

00:23:08.159 --> 00:23:10.799
Caption: the example that we&#39;re going to go with

00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:11.760
Caption: it&#39;s quite

00:23:10.798 --> 00:23:13.939
Caption: um

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:17.280
Caption: quite a simple one

00:23:13.939 --> 00:23:19.798
Caption: so have you ever thought about what the

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:23.099
Caption: HTML or JavaScript might be behind those

00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:24.599
Caption: charts I don&#39;t know commbank uh

00:23:23.099 --> 00:23:27.599
Caption: I actually haven&#39;t tested it but I&#39;m

00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:30.479
Caption: pretty sure comb Banks uh kind of income

00:23:27.599 --> 00:23:33.418
Caption: outcome that&#39;s not the right words

00:23:30.479 --> 00:23:35.640
Caption: um incoming and outgoing expenses are

00:23:33.418 --> 00:23:36.239
Caption: are quite accessible yeah

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.000
Caption: um

00:23:36.239 --> 00:23:40.558
Caption: and uh

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.119
Caption: um so

00:23:40.558 --> 00:23:43.140
Caption: oh sorry

00:23:42.119 --> 00:23:44.520
Caption: um

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.200
Caption: yeah have you ever thought about like

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.299
Caption: what what is the HTML that is behind

00:23:46.199 --> 00:23:52.918
Caption: those charts

00:23:48.298 --> 00:23:54.839
Caption: uh but first usually uh we have a table

00:23:52.918 --> 00:23:58.199
Caption: of data whether or not it&#39;s in Excel or

00:23:54.839 --> 00:24:00.599
Caption: it&#39;s made possibly in a Json uh payload

00:23:58.199 --> 00:24:02.459
Caption: that&#39;s coming back from some service

00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:05.038
Caption: um you we usually have some data in some

00:24:02.459 --> 00:24:05.779
Caption: sort of kind of tabular format

00:24:05.038 --> 00:24:08.639
Caption: um

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.940
Caption: and uh which is Handy you should keep

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.940
Caption: this around

00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:15.840
Caption: um and now is actually a good time to

00:24:13.199 --> 00:24:18.119
Caption: ask with this table of data

00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:20.819
Caption: do we really need a chart for this

00:24:18.119 --> 00:24:22.619
Caption: or can we just leave it as a table and

00:24:20.819 --> 00:24:23.699
Caption: like that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty good

00:24:22.619 --> 00:24:26.819
Caption: um these are not real numbers of

00:24:23.699 --> 00:24:29.639
Caption: anything I just made them up um

00:24:26.819 --> 00:24:32.339
Caption: uh

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.780
Caption: um so if the answer is yes then all you

00:24:32.339 --> 00:24:36.719
Caption: need to do is make sure that the HTML

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.619
Caption: table is is accessible

00:24:36.719 --> 00:24:41.459
Caption: um

00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:42.658
Caption: and uh voila A Accessible Dynamic data

00:24:41.459 --> 00:24:46.558
Caption: visualization

00:24:42.659 --> 00:24:47.640
Caption: so on the screen I have a table of data

00:24:46.558 --> 00:24:48.418
Caption: with

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.479
Caption: um

00:24:48.418 --> 00:24:54.719
Caption: two headers of incoming and outgoing

00:24:51.479 --> 00:24:57.418
Caption: um and three rows of the months of July

00:24:54.719 --> 00:25:00.959
Caption: August and September and some dollar

00:24:57.418 --> 00:25:04.079
Caption: figures in there and

00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:06.479
Caption: so let&#39;s have a look at how to code this

00:25:04.079 --> 00:25:09.619
Caption: successfully

00:25:06.479 --> 00:25:09.619
Caption: oh that is very small

00:25:10.199 --> 00:25:13.139
Caption: um

00:25:11.219 --> 00:25:15.719
Caption: so I&#39;ll try to talk through it as best

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:20.640
Caption: that I can so

00:25:15.719 --> 00:25:22.500
Caption: uh just some things to remember is uh so

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.339
Caption: oh firstly the

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:26.099
Caption: um

00:25:23.339 --> 00:25:28.140
Caption: the quickest way is to head to the Wai

00:25:26.099 --> 00:25:30.298
Caption: w3c site and have a look at the tables

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.039
Caption: tutorial has excellent every type of

00:25:30.298 --> 00:25:33.599
Caption: table you could think of like where you

00:25:32.038 --> 00:25:35.219
Caption: have like a header row and a header

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:38.819
Caption: column or you just have a header row or

00:25:35.219 --> 00:25:40.380
Caption: you have some random uh headers uh Here

00:25:38.819 --> 00:25:42.778
Caption: There and Everywhere

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:45.000
Caption: um but the the one thing that I&#39;ve

00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:49.679
Caption: noticed folks forget the most is making

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.500
Caption: sure to add scope to use th when when a

00:25:49.678 --> 00:25:54.599
Caption: cell is a header

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.859
Caption: um and using scope equals coal if the

00:25:54.599 --> 00:26:00.020
Caption: header is along the top and it&#39;s

00:25:55.859 --> 00:26:02.640
Caption: referring to the column and

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:07.979
Caption: referring to scope and adding scope

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:10.020
Caption: equals rho when a cell is a th in the

00:26:07.979 --> 00:26:12.058
Caption: the header of a row so this is a table

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.339
Caption: with a row header and a column header

00:26:12.058 --> 00:26:15.178
Caption: and column headers

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:17.520
Caption: um

00:26:15.178 --> 00:26:19.798
Caption: and

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.979
Caption: a little bit of kind of extra extra

00:26:19.798 --> 00:26:25.979
Caption: niceties to make numbers easier to read

00:26:22.979 --> 00:26:27.900
Caption: in this table we&#39;ve also added a class

00:26:25.979 --> 00:26:30.058
Caption: to make sure that we right align the

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.619
Caption: numbers because it is been known and

00:26:30.058 --> 00:26:35.158
Caption: researched that it easier to read

00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:37.020
Caption: numbers that are that are right aligned

00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:38.700
Caption: um and have commas and and all that good

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:42.619
Caption: ux stuff

00:26:38.699 --> 00:26:42.619
Caption: uh all right so

00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:51.298
Caption: on to a uh Dynamic data visualize the

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:53.459
Caption: data visualization so

00:26:51.298 --> 00:26:56.399
Caption: um we decided no we don&#39;t want a table

00:26:53.459 --> 00:26:58.020
Caption: we want to go a little bit fancier uh so

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.820
Caption: on the screen I have an interactive

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.679
Caption: chart and

00:26:59.819 --> 00:27:04.139
Caption: um you wouldn&#39;t know it but it&#39;s not

00:27:01.678 --> 00:27:07.319
Caption: actually interactive yet

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:10.619
Caption: um so what I&#39;ve got is a link before the

00:27:07.319 --> 00:27:12.119
Caption: chart and a link after the chart I think

00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:13.859
Caption: Julie is cringing because I forgot to

00:27:12.119 --> 00:27:16.859
Caption: put underlines in the CSS to show that

00:27:13.859 --> 00:27:18.658
Caption: they are links apologies and I&#39;ve got a

00:27:16.859 --> 00:27:22.020
Caption: big chart in the middle that is a column

00:27:18.659 --> 00:27:25.080
Caption: chart that is the chart chart

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:26.940
Caption: representation of the data that we just

00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:29.939
Caption: had in the table on the previous slide

00:27:26.939 --> 00:27:33.538
Caption: and so I will uh firstly do start off

00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:35.579
Caption: with using keyboard to test

00:27:33.538 --> 00:27:38.239
Caption: so hopefully

00:27:35.579 --> 00:27:38.239
Caption: I can

00:27:39.119 --> 00:27:42.739
Caption: the focus Styles will come up

00:27:43.979 --> 00:27:46.760
Caption: they will not

00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:52.380
Caption: maybe if I get out of full screen mode

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.178
Caption: gape

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:57.539
Caption: all right

00:27:54.178 --> 00:27:59.640
Caption: oh the focus styles are very faint

00:27:57.538 --> 00:28:01.500
Caption: that is not great I&#39;m going to switch to

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.320
Caption: Chrome apologies

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:06.859
Caption: we will need Safari later to test with a

00:28:04.319 --> 00:28:06.859
Caption: screen reader

00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:21.239
Caption: okay

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.820
Caption: and we&#39;re back and hopefully

00:28:21.239 --> 00:28:25.500
Caption: there we go uh hopefully those that can

00:28:23.819 --> 00:28:28.500
Caption: see the screen can see the focus outline

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:30.359
Caption: on the first link before the chart and

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.099
Caption: we are expecting to be able to tab into

00:28:30.359 --> 00:28:35.099
Caption: the chart and kind of interact with it

00:28:32.099 --> 00:28:37.739
Caption: so uh if we hover over it with our Mouse

00:28:35.099 --> 00:28:40.079
Caption: we can see oh fantastic there&#39;s some uh

00:28:37.739 --> 00:28:42.599
Caption: really cool kind of uh it fades out the

00:28:40.079 --> 00:28:43.859
Caption: other data and and and Fades in the data

00:28:42.599 --> 00:28:45.359
Caption: that you are looking at all the columns

00:28:43.859 --> 00:28:46.739
Caption: that you&#39;re looking at and there&#39;s a

00:28:45.359 --> 00:28:49.319
Caption: little tiny tool tips that you probably

00:28:46.739 --> 00:28:51.119
Caption: can&#39;t read from back there but they are

00:28:49.319 --> 00:28:53.158
Caption: tortoise that have all the information

00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:54.719
Caption: so that if you were someone who might

00:28:53.159 --> 00:28:56.700
Caption: use screen magnification if you are

00:28:54.719 --> 00:28:57.959
Caption: zoomed right into that tooltip you have

00:28:56.699 --> 00:29:00.239
Caption: all the information that you need and

00:28:57.959 --> 00:29:02.278
Caption: you don&#39;t need to kind of scroll across

00:29:00.239 --> 00:29:04.979
Caption: to the axes to to kind of guess what

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:07.799
Caption: this uh what the what the um

00:29:04.979 --> 00:29:09.599
Caption: y-axis in the x-axis categories are so

00:29:07.798 --> 00:29:11.459
Caption: everything you need is in that tooltip

00:29:09.599 --> 00:29:15.900
Caption: which is great

00:29:11.459 --> 00:29:17.819
Caption: um and uh and we can click on the legend

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.320
Caption: to toggle on and off that&#39;s a nice

00:29:17.819 --> 00:29:21.298
Caption: feature

00:29:19.319 --> 00:29:23.759
Caption: um straight out of high charts uh

00:29:21.298 --> 00:29:25.019
Caption: everything you ever wanted in data

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.599
Caption: visualization

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:30.239
Caption: so

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:32.158
Caption: let&#39;s try and see so I can&#39;t use a mouse

00:29:30.239 --> 00:29:33.479
Caption: let&#39;s say let&#39;s try and interact with

00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:36.480
Caption: that chart

00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:38.398
Caption: oh uh it skipped to the link straight

00:29:36.479 --> 00:29:41.099
Caption: under the chart there is no way that I

00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:43.320
Caption: can get to that chart the focus outline

00:29:41.099 --> 00:29:46.319
Caption: is going up and down up and down so how

00:29:43.319 --> 00:29:48.418
Caption: do we fix that so unfortunately

00:29:46.319 --> 00:29:49.918
Caption: um High charts does not uh out of the

00:29:48.418 --> 00:29:51.298
Caption: box

00:29:49.918 --> 00:29:54.479
Caption: um give you the accessibility straight

00:29:51.298 --> 00:29:58.619
Caption: away I really wish that it did

00:29:54.479 --> 00:30:01.079
Caption: so I will add it I&#39;m using a framework

00:29:58.619 --> 00:30:01.798
Caption: called reveal.js for the slides

00:30:01.079 --> 00:30:05.519
Caption: um

00:30:01.798 --> 00:30:08.278
Caption: and so I can just add that module in the

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.179
Caption: code that I&#39;ve preferred earlier

00:30:08.279 --> 00:30:11.299
Caption: um

00:30:09.178 --> 00:30:13.319
Caption: so I will

00:30:11.298 --> 00:30:16.079
Caption: you don&#39;t need to pay too much attention

00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:21.079
Caption: to this I will just uh

00:30:16.079 --> 00:30:24.178
Caption: uncomment out some JavaScript modules to

00:30:21.079 --> 00:30:26.038
Caption: show how few steps it is so I&#39;m

00:30:24.178 --> 00:30:28.079
Caption: uncommenting out I actually only need to

00:30:26.038 --> 00:30:30.119
Caption: uncomment out one line of JavaScript

00:30:28.079 --> 00:30:31.260
Caption: modules but I&#39;ve added the other two so

00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:33.739
Caption: that I can talk through them at the same

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.739
Caption: time as well

00:30:33.839 --> 00:30:36.319
Caption: um all right

00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:41.178
Caption: so I should probably save it

00:30:42.859 --> 00:30:47.339
Caption: uh and I&#39;m back into Safari I want to go

00:30:46.079 --> 00:30:49.260
Caption: into

00:30:47.339 --> 00:30:52.619
Caption: Ryan

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.719
Caption: main Chrome yes I&#39;ll do a refresh

00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:56.219
Caption: all right uh

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:58.140
Caption: you may or may not have noticed

00:30:56.219 --> 00:30:59.699
Caption: something changed on the screen uh if

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.558
Caption: you didn&#39;t there&#39;s a little menu on the

00:30:59.699 --> 00:31:02.880
Caption: top right hand corner now I&#39;ll talk

00:31:01.558 --> 00:31:05.760
Caption: about that later but let&#39;s see if it&#39;s

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.500
Caption: keyboard accessible oh my goodness so we

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.020
Caption: are in so I&#39;ve just tabbed from the link

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:13.439
Caption: before the chart into the chart and it&#39;s

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:17.039
Caption: focused on the First Column uh that is

00:31:13.439 --> 00:31:21.119
Caption: the incoming uh

00:31:17.038 --> 00:31:24.298
Caption: um the monthly income for July 2022.

00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:26.939
Caption: and if I press tab again it focuses on

00:31:24.298 --> 00:31:30.500
Caption: the legend which has incoming as a light

00:31:26.939 --> 00:31:33.658
Caption: blue kind of color and outgoing as a

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:36.079
Caption: very dark gray color and if I tab one

00:31:33.659 --> 00:31:38.880
Caption: more time it focuses me to the menu

00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:42.019
Caption: hamburger icon on the top

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:46.918
Caption: and then one last time uh to the link

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:49.859
Caption: after the chart and so notice that

00:31:46.918 --> 00:31:51.359
Caption: um so I&#39;m just pressing Tab and it

00:31:49.859 --> 00:31:52.979
Caption: doesn&#39;t actually take me through each

00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:54.359
Caption: individual data point because if there

00:31:52.979 --> 00:31:55.979
Caption: were a lot of those that would take a

00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:57.479
Caption: person a very long time to tab all the

00:31:55.979 --> 00:31:59.699
Caption: way through

00:31:57.479 --> 00:32:00.719
Caption: um and uh and get to kind of the rest of

00:31:59.699 --> 00:32:01.798
Caption: the article if they don&#39;t really care

00:32:00.719 --> 00:32:04.500
Caption: about the chart

00:32:01.798 --> 00:32:07.739
Caption: all the rest of the app

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:10.500
Caption: um so what they have added in here and

00:32:07.739 --> 00:32:13.319
Caption: and this is all quite new and and not

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:14.880
Caption: really uh as several libraries have kind

00:32:13.319 --> 00:32:16.380
Caption: of done different things um there&#39;s also

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.359
Caption: another awesome accessible accessible

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.880
Caption: chart library from Visa called the Visa

00:32:18.359 --> 00:32:21.538
Caption: chart components Library I think

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.699
Caption: um

00:32:21.538 --> 00:32:26.939
Caption: and so they have different kind of

00:32:23.699 --> 00:32:28.439
Caption: keyboard behaviors uh but I really

00:32:26.939 --> 00:32:30.959
Caption: really like the high charts one it&#39;s

00:32:28.439 --> 00:32:31.619
Caption: really simple and

00:32:30.959 --> 00:32:36.000
Caption: um

00:32:31.619 --> 00:32:37.678
Caption: and uh so I&#39;ve kind of used that one as

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.880
Caption: a reference if I was to build my own

00:32:37.678 --> 00:32:40.739
Caption: again

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.058
Caption: um and when I built that one um

00:32:40.739 --> 00:32:43.979
Caption: way back when

00:32:42.058 --> 00:32:45.959
Caption: so the way to get to different data

00:32:43.979 --> 00:32:47.278
Caption: series is using the Eric our data points

00:32:45.959 --> 00:32:49.739
Caption: is using the arrow key so I&#39;ve just hit

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:52.619
Caption: right arrow it&#39;s gone to the next column

00:32:49.739 --> 00:32:56.099
Caption: of the same data series or incoming

00:32:52.619 --> 00:32:57.599
Caption: um monthly income I don&#39;t know why what

00:32:56.099 --> 00:33:01.079
Caption: word I&#39;m looking for

00:32:57.599 --> 00:33:03.898
Caption: um and then uh hitting right right arrow

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:05.418
Caption: again is focused on the third

00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:09.299
Caption: column

00:33:05.418 --> 00:33:12.898
Caption: and so how do I get to the next data

00:33:09.298 --> 00:33:14.459
Caption: series or the outgoings I hit right

00:33:12.899 --> 00:33:15.779
Caption: arrow again just then and it focused on

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:17.339
Caption: the outgoing and if I keep hitting the

00:33:15.779 --> 00:33:20.460
Caption: right arrow and the left Arrow I can go

00:33:17.339 --> 00:33:22.319
Caption: between all of those columns but I can

00:33:20.459 --> 00:33:24.058
Caption: also switch between series by pressing

00:33:22.319 --> 00:33:25.619
Caption: up and down arrows so that&#39;s a really

00:33:24.058 --> 00:33:27.418
Caption: really nice

00:33:25.619 --> 00:33:29.699
Caption: um kind of behavior that high charts has

00:33:27.418 --> 00:33:31.079
Caption: come up with I&#39;m sure talking with lots

00:33:29.699 --> 00:33:33.678
Caption: of folks in the accessibility in the

00:33:31.079 --> 00:33:33.678
Caption: disability community

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:37.859
Caption: um all right

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:40.260
Caption: so same thing with the legend I can

00:33:37.859 --> 00:33:42.658
Caption: change between each so I&#39;ve just tabbed

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.159
Caption: the legend using left and right arrow to

00:33:42.659 --> 00:33:45.779
Caption: kind of switch between toggling them on

00:33:44.159 --> 00:33:49.799
Caption: and off

00:33:45.779 --> 00:33:54.059
Caption: um and uh going to the button I can

00:33:49.798 --> 00:33:56.819
Caption: press the space bar oh or press enter I

00:33:54.058 --> 00:33:58.500
Caption: can press the spacebar and use the arrow

00:33:56.819 --> 00:34:01.319
Caption: keys to scroll through the menu but drop

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:04.619
Caption: down menu accessibility is a whole

00:34:01.319 --> 00:34:07.558
Caption: nother talk but but basically you can

00:34:04.619 --> 00:34:09.739
Caption: press space or enter and escape to get

00:34:07.558 --> 00:34:12.540
Caption: out of the slides not the menu

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:14.580
Caption: so and there&#39;s a bunch of options that

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.739
Caption: they added in there in here in

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.359
Caption: particular being able to export the data

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:21.060
Caption: in a format that you like so they have

00:34:18.358 --> 00:34:22.878
Caption: CSV they have Excel they have viewer

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:25.439
Caption: data table which

00:34:22.878 --> 00:34:28.260
Caption: will actually show a data table I can&#39;t

00:34:25.439 --> 00:34:31.678
Caption: show it in the presentation because it

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:34.500
Caption: uh it it conflicts too much with the CSS

00:34:31.678 --> 00:34:37.199
Caption: of the reveal.js um but I do have a code

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:40.439
Caption: pen if we get time at the end

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:43.678
Caption: um but a lot of uh really awesome

00:34:40.439 --> 00:34:46.500
Caption: options so really really fully featured

00:34:43.678 --> 00:34:48.838
Caption: um uh

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:51.618
Caption: data visualization Library

00:34:48.839 --> 00:34:51.619
Caption: uh

00:34:51.658 --> 00:34:55.918
Caption: okay

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:58.080
Caption: so the screen reader experience

00:34:55.918 --> 00:35:00.118
Caption: let&#39;s have a look at that

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.660
Caption: live screen reader demos are not my

00:35:00.118 --> 00:35:04.739
Caption: forte let&#39;s see how this goes oh

00:35:02.659 --> 00:35:06.598
Caption: application Safari

00:35:04.739 --> 00:35:07.979
Caption: Safari inclusive storytelling with

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:09.060
Caption: Dynamic data window inclusive

00:35:07.979 --> 00:35:11.760
Caption: storytelling with Dynamic data where

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:13.260
Caption: content has keyboard Focus

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.739
Caption: yep

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.719
Caption: all right uh so if I press the link

00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:19.979
Caption: before the chart

00:35:17.719 --> 00:35:22.338
Caption: to click this link press control option

00:35:19.979 --> 00:35:22.338
Caption: space

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:28.320
Caption: and then I&#39;m going to press uh control

00:35:25.618 --> 00:35:32.219
Caption: option and use the arrow keys and so

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.959
Caption: this is a common misconception uh is

00:35:32.219 --> 00:35:35.939
Caption: that there is such a thing called a

00:35:33.959 --> 00:35:38.639
Caption: virtual cursor for screen reader for

00:35:35.939 --> 00:35:40.919
Caption: screen readers if you um are not so

00:35:38.639 --> 00:35:44.159
Caption: familiar with screen readers so it

00:35:40.919 --> 00:35:46.679
Caption: doesn&#39;t actually send any Focus or hover

00:35:44.159 --> 00:35:51.899
Caption: or or anything to the Chart itself so

00:35:46.679 --> 00:35:53.819
Caption: you won&#39;t see the same Focus Styles

00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:55.559
Caption: happening when I navigate around using

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.940
Caption: the screen reader

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.619
Caption: um and that is the reason why it doesn&#39;t

00:35:56.939 --> 00:36:01.500
Caption: send any sort of

00:35:58.618 --> 00:36:04.379
Caption: um actions to the chart and it relies

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:07.139
Caption: solely on having the correct Aria roles

00:36:04.379 --> 00:36:09.598
Caption: or the semantic HTML in the back too but

00:36:07.139 --> 00:36:10.500
Caption: you will see the square blocks if you

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:12.300
Caption: can see

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.280
Caption: um the square box of where this virtual

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.320
Caption: cursor is so you can get a bit of an

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:18.119
Caption: idea of what&#39;s going on and you will

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.920
Caption: notice that there is a lot more to this

00:36:18.118 --> 00:36:20.879

Caption: expenses it&#39;s got a heading level three

00:36:57.839 --> 00:37:02.400

Caption: headings to as a shortcut to navigate to

00:37:02.399 --> 00:37:07.039

Caption: all right

00:39:06.179 --> 00:39:08.838
Caption: so

00:39:09.659 --> 00:39:15.919
Caption: if I&#39;ve got a voiceover off I&#39;m going to

00:39:12.239 --> 00:39:15.919
Caption: turn that one off and go back to Chrome

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.820
Caption: okay so uh quickly to to kind of wrap up

00:39:27.839 --> 00:39:31.140
Caption: um just speaking through kind of what&#39;s

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.500
Caption: under the hood of what&#39;s made this

00:39:31.139 --> 00:39:33.500
Caption: accessible

00:39:33.719 --> 00:39:37.078
Caption: um and I do recommend to take the time

00:39:35.699 --> 00:39:39.419
Caption: to kind of look at what&#39;s going on if

00:39:37.079 --> 00:39:41.880
Caption: you do try out High charts uh inspect

00:39:39.419 --> 00:39:43.559
Caption: the Dom uh turn on the accessibility

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:44.819
Caption: tree it&#39;s in your developer tools you

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.739
Caption: can Google how to turn on the

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:49.859
Caption: accessibility Tree in either Chrome or

00:39:46.739 --> 00:39:51.780
Caption: uh or Firefox or whatever whatever

00:39:49.858 --> 00:39:54.419
Caption: browser you use um if you understand the

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:55.260
Caption: accessibility tree um super helpful

00:39:54.419 --> 00:39:58.699
Caption: um

00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:01.439
Caption: but uh in in kind of the the

00:39:58.699 --> 00:40:04.439
Caption: step-by-step firstly using JavaScript to

00:40:01.439 --> 00:40:05.338
Caption: add mouse and keyboard interactivity it

00:40:04.439 --> 00:40:07.739
Caption: is something that you have to

00:40:05.339 --> 00:40:08.880
Caption: deliberately do extra not for high

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:10.739
Caption: charts it&#39;s what&#39;s being done in high

00:40:08.879 --> 00:40:13.739
Caption: charts but if you were doing it yourself

00:40:10.739 --> 00:40:18.000
Caption: and adding Aria to the parts of the SVG

00:40:13.739 --> 00:40:19.618
Caption: to give it meaning so for example we

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.959
Caption: might have missed that with the demo

00:40:19.618 --> 00:40:25.739
Caption: just now uh High charts has actually

00:40:21.959 --> 00:40:28.379
Caption: marked up the columns as images and then

00:40:25.739 --> 00:40:28.979
Caption: added an aria label to those images

00:40:28.379 --> 00:40:30.899
Caption: um

00:40:28.979 --> 00:40:33.020
Caption: as it kind of represents what it is it

00:40:30.899 --> 00:40:35.399
Caption: is an image on a screen

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:37.079
Caption: and then adding that non-visual content

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:38.760
Caption: to describe the chart for the screen

00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:41.400
Caption: reader user

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.179
Caption: um and it&#39;s also great for SEO

00:40:41.399 --> 00:40:45.239
Caption: um

00:40:42.179 --> 00:40:46.439
Caption: and uh and last but not least uh back to

00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:48.358
Caption: the start of the talk when we&#39;re talking

00:40:46.439 --> 00:40:50.040
Caption: about just working on accessibility for

00:40:48.358 --> 00:40:52.618
Caption: an image of a chart don&#39;t forget about

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.419
Caption: the content and visual accessibility as

00:40:52.618 --> 00:40:57.239
Caption: well so that applies for both

00:40:54.419 --> 00:41:00.000
Caption: interactive charts keyword navigation is

00:40:57.239 --> 00:41:01.560
Caption: tabbing to the main bits so don&#39;t make

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.358
Caption: them tab through absolutely every data

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:06.239
Caption: point arrow keys between the data points

00:41:03.358 --> 00:41:08.338
Caption: or space or enter for buttons and for a

00:41:06.239 --> 00:41:10.199
Caption: screen reader front load the info give

00:41:08.339 --> 00:41:12.480
Caption: them

00:41:10.199 --> 00:41:13.858
Caption: give screen really uses uh kind of as

00:41:12.479 --> 00:41:15.899
Caption: much info as possible that they can pick

00:41:13.858 --> 00:41:17.338
Caption: through and but also make sure you give

00:41:15.899 --> 00:41:19.739
Caption: them the choice to kind of skip all of

00:41:17.339 --> 00:41:22.140
Caption: that so make sure you have your headings

00:41:19.739 --> 00:41:25.079
Caption: um on um or or

00:41:22.139 --> 00:41:27.179
Caption: uh or even a skip chart button is um

00:41:25.079 --> 00:41:30.359
Caption: something that we&#39;ve used before as well

00:41:27.179 --> 00:41:32.459
Caption: and don&#39;t get too creative with Arya uh

00:41:30.358 --> 00:41:34.879
Caption: the first rule of Arya is don&#39;t use Arya

00:41:32.459 --> 00:41:36.838
Caption: a few accessibility folks

00:41:34.879 --> 00:41:40.139
Caption: familiar with that

00:41:36.839 --> 00:41:42.180
Caption: um please use the high charts or other

00:41:40.139 --> 00:41:44.000
Caption: Frameworks that have tested with real

00:41:42.179 --> 00:41:46.559
Caption: folks as a reference

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.500
Caption: and if you do roll your own and I&#39;ve

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.380
Caption: spelled roll wrong on the screen uh

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:54.060
Caption: please make sure you engage usability

00:41:52.379 --> 00:41:57.059
Caption: testing with screen reader users and and

00:41:54.060 --> 00:42:00.239
Caption: other assistive technology users

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:02.520
Caption: all right a note on color uh this is a

00:42:00.239 --> 00:42:04.260
Caption: big one and I&#39;ve left it to kind of a

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.119
Caption: little tiny Gap

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:08.280
Caption: um don&#39;t use color alone to

00:42:06.118 --> 00:42:11.279
Caption: differentiate data or differentiate

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:13.619
Caption: different data series uh so there&#39;s lots

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.079
Caption: of talks about using patterns

00:42:13.618 --> 00:42:17.338
Caption: um you can use different shape markers

00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:20.040
Caption: and different patterns and stuff like

00:42:17.339 --> 00:42:21.359
Caption: that but High trust has also done

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.520
Caption: research on this and they say to use

00:42:21.358 --> 00:42:26.279
Caption: monochrome palettes if possible and so

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:28.320
Caption: this helps everyone not just kind of red

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:31.859
Caption: green colorblind folks

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:33.719
Caption: um and it&#39;s also got cool kind of side

00:42:31.858 --> 00:42:35.519
Caption: effects like you can print tactile

00:42:33.719 --> 00:42:37.270
Caption: charts if you make sure that you use a

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.800
Caption: monochrome palette

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:38.579
Caption: [Music]

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.679
Caption: um

00:42:38.579 --> 00:42:44.640
Caption: and also be careful with patterns they

00:42:40.679 --> 00:42:46.139
Caption: can make it worse so uh and um I I

00:42:44.639 --> 00:42:49.078
Caption: haven&#39;t noticed that myself so don&#39;t

00:42:46.139 --> 00:42:50.578
Caption: just go stick a pattern on it done have

00:42:49.079 --> 00:42:52.320
Caption: a little take a little bit time to think

00:42:50.579 --> 00:42:54.359
Caption: about it

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.040
Caption: all right and I have a whole bunch of

00:42:54.358 --> 00:42:58.919
Caption: resources on there

00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:01.679
Caption: um chart ability I highly recommend it

00:42:58.919 --> 00:43:03.659
Caption: is like a wikag for charts or or a

00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:06.300
Caption: checklist of tests that is really deep

00:43:03.659 --> 00:43:08.578
Caption: and really really useful for charts

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:10.020
Caption: um and accessibility of database but I

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:12.239

00:43:36.839 --> 00:43:40.920
Caption: accessibility sins that I commit on a

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:43.079
Caption: daily basis from that
