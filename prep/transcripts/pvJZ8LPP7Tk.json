  "description": "\u2026 well, that\u2019s our current best theory of what we are.  The \u201CComputational Theory of Mind\u201D says that our minds are computers.  But, to be clear, that doesn\u2019t mean we have a CPU, RAM, and hard disk.  Come along to this talk to learn what it really means for a calculator, a phone, and for US to be computers.\\n\\nThis is not a talk about machine learning algorithms, it\u2019s more about what it means to be a thinking machine.  It\u2019s not only about helping computers think more like us, but also helping us to understand that we are more like computers.  It will help you prepare for the coming wave of \u201Cthinking machines.\u201D\\n\\nAI/ML software has already beaten the world\u2019s best humans at Chess, Jeopardy, Go, and some video games, and now it\u2019s learning how to play games from scratch, writing text, writing code, and more.  As a result, it\u2019s also time for us to start talking more about \u201Cmachine with minds.\u201D\\n\\nThis talk will also hypothesise a little about what it means for a computer (and us) to be aware, self-aware, to have free will, and to feel like we do, i.e. to have a mind. It combines research in Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, even and some Philosophy of Mind.\\n\\nThe speaker has a PhD in Artificial Intelligence (including Cognitive Science and Neuroscience) from UNSW.  They have written and published research and conference papers on AI.  They have provided advice and guidance to AI startups, and to organisations keen to use AI to improve their operations.\\n\\nNo experience necessary\\n45 mins\\nAI \\u0026 ML\\nAshley is a startup explorer, software engineer, academic, and professional trainer.
