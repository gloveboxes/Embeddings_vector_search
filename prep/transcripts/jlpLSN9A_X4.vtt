00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.839
Caption: towards the science and the tech

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.360

Caption: that point in my career where i wanted

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.518

00:03:21.518 --> 00:03:25.119

Caption: few seconds in the next decade

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:43.199

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:44.479
Caption: movies

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.959
Caption: and although cyber cyber pearl harbor

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.720
Caption: was quite a new phrasing to me because

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:50.160
Caption: like i said i&#39;ve been in wonderful world

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.279

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.839
Caption: um it&#39;s actually been around for nearly

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:57.359
Caption: 30 years as a concept so it&#39;s not even

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.720
Caption: this week&#39;s sound bite that you guys

00:05:57.359 --> 00:06:00.478

Caption: um it&#39;s a it&#39;s like i said 30 years ago

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:09.119
Caption: we coined the expression an electronic

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:12.638
Caption: pearl harbor and it rose to prominence

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:15.839
Caption: again around 2011 2013 time frame when

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.160
Caption: the u.s defense secretary leon panetta

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:20.959
Caption: said that he was concerned about a cyber

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.000
Caption: pearl harbor and very specifically the

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:26.399
Caption: reference not michael bay but an attack

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.079
Caption: on critical infrastructure

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:32.479
Caption: but apparently

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:32.478
Caption: since 2013 it&#39;s been imminent

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:39.199
Caption: so i got quite you know watching this

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:41.359

Caption: these kind of challenging times

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.880

Caption: tendency

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:06.160
Caption: for us to look to leaders in challenging

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:08.880
Caption: times we look to someone else who might

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:12.720
Caption: have the answers to help us and we have

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.800
Caption: a tendency to give up our agency

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.679
Caption: we see this throughout history whether

00:07:14.799 --> 00:07:21.039

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:28.239
Caption: the answers who are strong figures

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.399
Caption: and we also see it in the movies

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:32.720

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.399
Caption: to a leader and it&#39;s at that point that

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:54.239
Caption: you see the democratic got to get this

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:58.720

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.799
Caption: okay so cyber security to me when i was

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:04.799
Caption: in those sessions hearing about the

00:08:02.799 --> 00:08:06.319
Caption: cyber pearl harbor and existential

00:08:04.799 --> 00:08:08.079
Caption: threats felt

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:10.319
Caption: this seems quite challenging

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:13.839
Caption: do we live in challenging times

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:16.239
Caption: do we ever um the last 12 months alone

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:17.839
Caption: have put humanity through its paces this

00:08:16.239 --> 00:08:19.839
Caption: is the stuff that the world has been

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:20.878
Caption: having to contend with

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:23.199
Caption: um

00:08:20.878 --> 00:08:25.039
Caption: and how do more than just me how does

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:27.440
Caption: more than just me feel about this if we

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:28.639
Caption: look at australians and say

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.239
Caption: do we

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:32.640
Caption: how do we react to to living in

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:34.799
Caption: challenging times australia talks does

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.000
Caption: this really great survey where they pull

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:38.398
Caption: us on

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Caption: aspects of our day-to-day life that are

00:08:38.398 --> 00:08:42.080
Caption: interesting and it&#39;s everything from how

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.679
Caption: frequently do you change your bed sheets

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.200
Caption: through to what are your thoughts about

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:47.278
Caption: restricting your personal freedom for

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.440
Caption: the greater good um so it&#39;s quite a

00:08:47.278 --> 00:08:53.518
Caption: broad section of questions that get

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.278
Caption: asked but we learned that in 2019 54 of

00:08:53.518 --> 00:08:57.838
Caption: us were comfortable with restricting our

00:08:55.278 --> 00:08:59.119
Caption: personal freedoms for the sake of of

00:08:57.838 --> 00:09:02.479
Caption: australia

00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:05.440
Caption: but in 2021 there is a swing a huge and

00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:08.239
Caption: rapid swing of 70 of us are comfortable

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.958
Caption: with giving up those personal freedoms

00:09:08.239 --> 00:09:14.320
Caption: and that to me is a massive shift in in

00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:16.640
Caption: a nation&#39;s thoughts and beliefs

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.518
Caption: so where to from here we have got cyber

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.119
Caption: crime increasing we&#39;ve got the no the

00:09:19.518 --> 00:09:23.359
Caption: notion that there could be a critical

00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:26.000
Caption: infrastructure attack and that could be

00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:28.958
Caption: absolutely major and catastrophic and

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.880
Caption: we&#39;ve got australian sentiment able to

00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:33.440
Caption: shift often rapidly and often

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:36.239
Caption: significantly and we notice that it has

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.080
Caption: shifted in in a way that&#39;s complementary

00:09:36.239 --> 00:09:40.159
Caption: with this tendency of humans to give

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.239
Caption: over our agency to someone who&#39;s got all

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:44.719
Caption: the answers and can help us and we&#39;re

00:09:42.239 --> 00:09:46.559
Caption: confounded by this media hype about

00:09:44.719 --> 00:09:49.838
Caption: being on the battlefield facing

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:52.000
Caption: existential threats and honestly it&#39;s

00:09:49.838 --> 00:09:55.200
Caption: quite overwhelming to me and you think

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.119
Caption: what on earth can one person do in the

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.760
Caption: face of the scale of the things that are

00:09:57.119 --> 00:09:59.760
Caption: facing us

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.159
Caption: so i was chatting to my husband thinking

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:06.159
Caption: i&#39;m feeling a bit frightened i&#39;m feeling

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:08.159
Caption: a bit uncertain about the future this

00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:10.479
Caption: this is like a big stuff that we&#39;re

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:12.479
Caption: going to have to wrestle with

00:10:10.479 --> 00:10:14.000
Caption: but i don&#39;t want to give up i think

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:16.398
Caption: we&#39;ve got to have

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.719
Caption: um belief and positive and focus and a

00:10:16.398 --> 00:10:20.799
Caption: way forward into the future and i was

00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:22.719
Caption: curious because he works in health and

00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:24.320
Caption: safety and the safety professionals have

00:10:22.719 --> 00:10:27.679
Caption: been dealing with industries that face

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.359
Caption: catastrophe for years so maybe i thought

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:30.838
Caption: there is something i could finally learn

00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:33.440
Caption: from

00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:36.799
Caption: him so the first thing he introduced me

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:39.119
Caption: to was the catastrophic theory of reform

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:41.919
Caption: which is where you see a catastrophe

00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:43.599
Caption: followed by outcry followed by lagging

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:46.159
Caption: regulation

00:10:43.599 --> 00:10:48.398
Caption: so on the board here going back to two

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:50.879
Caption: years before the first world war we&#39;ve

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:53.200
Caption: got the world&#39;s first global media event

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.679
Caption: which was the titanic

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.160
Caption: it made the newspapers in new york and

00:10:55.679 --> 00:11:01.200
Caption: london and that was the day after it had

00:10:58.159 --> 00:11:02.799
Caption: happened and it led to global outcry

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.880
Caption: after that there was a chunk of

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:07.760
Caption: regulation that landed and a majority of

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.000
Caption: that is actually still in force today

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.720
Caption: and we&#39;ve seen this repeated pattern of

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.119
Caption: a catastrophe followed by regulation

00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:16.159
Caption: all the way through to recent times

00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:18.398
Caption: some of the

00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:20.239
Caption: regulation has been exceptional and very

00:11:18.398 --> 00:11:22.398
Caption: valuable but some of the safety

00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:23.518
Caption: professionals will also question

00:11:22.398 --> 00:11:26.000
Caption: why

00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:27.838
Caption: in the face of aeroplane hijacking did

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.440
Caption: that lead to security regulation on

00:11:27.838 --> 00:11:31.760
Caption: board ships

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.078
Caption: was that more to quell the outcry or the

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.518
Caption: actual problems that were at hand at

00:11:34.078 --> 00:11:37.679
Caption: that time

00:11:35.518 --> 00:11:41.119
Caption: which is an interesting angle to explore

00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:42.398
Caption: does the media frenzy about um an

00:11:41.119 --> 00:11:45.200
Caption: incident

00:11:42.398 --> 00:11:47.679
Caption: kind of lead to regulation and can you

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.679
Caption: feed regulation into society through

00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:53.518
Caption: kind of pumping it through the media

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:56.078
Caption: do we have this trend in cyber security

00:11:53.518 --> 00:11:58.159
Caption: for sure yes we do so you may remember

00:11:56.078 --> 00:12:00.479
Caption: hopefully the colonial pipeline

00:11:58.159 --> 00:12:03.599
Caption: ransomware attack in may this year so

00:12:00.479 --> 00:12:06.239
Caption: that happened and within the month the

00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:08.078
Caption: transport security administration

00:12:06.239 --> 00:12:09.838
Caption: issued their first directive and then a

00:12:08.078 --> 00:12:11.838
Caption: month or so later they followed up with

00:12:09.838 --> 00:12:14.000
Caption: their second directive and it&#39;s pretty

00:12:11.838 --> 00:12:15.838
Caption: straightforward stuff it&#39;s targeted to

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.320
Caption: pipeline owners but it&#39;s things like do

00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:20.799
Caption: a security architecture review make sure

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.398
Caption: you have an emergency backup plan and

00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:25.278
Caption: have you considered mitigating some

00:12:22.398 --> 00:12:27.359
Caption: stuff to um you know lower your risk in

00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:29.679
Caption: the future attack on of ransomware

00:12:27.359 --> 00:12:29.679
Caption: attacks

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.160
Caption: so

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:33.440
Caption: question for us in the room is is this

00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:35.838
Caption: any of this stuff kind of likely to

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.239
Caption: happen to us here in wa

00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:40.159
Caption: well it&#39;s not for me to say how likely

00:12:38.239 --> 00:12:41.200
Caption: it is but to me i think it&#39;s very

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:43.518
Caption: credible

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.760
Caption: if you look at the the structure and the

00:12:43.518 --> 00:12:48.159
Caption: makeup of our area you&#39;ve got highly

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.320
Caption: interconnected critical infrastructure

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:52.000
Caption: you&#39;ve got pipelines

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.638
Caption: and you&#39;ve also got a very complex

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.119
Caption: supply chain and that unique geography

00:12:54.638 --> 00:13:00.000
Caption: where we connect across vast distances

00:12:57.119 --> 00:13:02.320
Caption: to points of technology and culture

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.398
Caption: it it&#39;s presenting a very interesting

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.320
Caption: challenge for us to keep stable secure

00:13:04.398 --> 00:13:07.919
Caption: and resilient and i don&#39;t think any

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.359
Caption: western australian is going to let you

00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:12.000
Caption: forget how much of an economic

00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:14.159
Caption: contribution we make to australia

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.039
Caption: and given that a huge amount of what we

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:18.638
Caption: do is export that&#39;s valuable insight for

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:20.799
Caption: someone who&#39;s trying to buy the thing

00:13:18.638 --> 00:13:21.679
Caption: that we&#39;re selling for them to know what

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:23.838
Caption: we are

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:25.278
Caption: running at cost and what the prices are

00:13:23.838 --> 00:13:26.638
Caption: that puts them in a very strong

00:13:25.278 --> 00:13:30.479
Caption: bargaining position when they&#39;re trying

00:13:26.638 --> 00:13:32.078
Caption: to negotiate with us for purchasing

00:13:30.479 --> 00:13:34.638
Caption: what else is happening to us here well

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:36.398
Caption: we are seeing regulation

00:13:34.638 --> 00:13:38.078
Caption: the australian government has produced a

00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:40.479
Caption: cyber security strategy that they

00:13:38.078 --> 00:13:43.359
Caption: launched last year we we see them

00:13:40.479 --> 00:13:45.039
Caption: bolstering law enforcement capability

00:13:43.359 --> 00:13:48.000
Caption: they are investing in specific

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:49.039
Caption: jurisdictions and trying to get them

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.518
Caption: better

00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:54.078
Caption: in a better position to share data and

00:13:51.518 --> 00:13:56.559
Caption: to collaborate and ultimately lift their

00:13:54.078 --> 00:13:58.559
Caption: own capabilities and responses

00:13:56.559 --> 00:14:01.119
Caption: we&#39;re seeing an investment in growth on

00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:03.039
Caption: cyber security skills even down to the

00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:05.198
Caption: six-year-olds in primary school learning

00:14:03.039 --> 00:14:07.039
Caption: the basics of cyber hygiene

00:14:05.198 --> 00:14:10.479
Caption: they&#39;re discussing a bill right now that

00:14:07.039 --> 00:14:14.320
Caption: proposes um anyone who is experiencing a

00:14:10.479 --> 00:14:17.278
Caption: ransomware attack must notify the acsc

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.958
Caption: prior to making any ransomware payments

00:14:17.278 --> 00:14:20.559
Caption: they&#39;re also dropping lots of

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:23.278
Caption: recommendations and guidelines and

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:25.838
Caption: regulations through things like the asd

00:14:23.278 --> 00:14:28.078
Caption: 37 the essential eight

00:14:25.838 --> 00:14:30.239
Caption: and they are focusing on critical

00:14:28.078 --> 00:14:32.479
Caption: infrastructure so they&#39;re making

00:14:30.239 --> 00:14:34.320
Caption: amendments to build that exist that

00:14:32.479 --> 00:14:36.958
Caption: expands the definition of a critical

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.958
Caption: infrastructure from four to eleven so

00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.958
Caption: now many smaller players suddenly find

00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:43.039
Caption: themselves part of the supply chain of a

00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:45.518
Caption: critical infrastructure industry and

00:14:43.039 --> 00:14:48.159
Caption: subject to that kind of regulation

00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:49.359
Caption: and also it allows the asd that&#39;s the

00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:52.159
Caption: spooks

00:14:49.359 --> 00:14:53.838
Caption: to come and lend their expertise when

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:55.838
Caption: you are going through a ransomware

00:14:53.838 --> 00:14:56.838
Caption: attack or a critical attack that has

00:14:55.838 --> 00:15:00.320
Caption: national

00:14:56.838 --> 00:15:02.000
Caption: significance so yeah regulation tick

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.799
Caption: we have a parallel between the cyber

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.078
Caption: security teams and domains and also the

00:15:04.799 --> 00:15:10.239
Caption: safety industry so what else

00:15:08.078 --> 00:15:12.320
Caption: maybe regulation is the way that we

00:15:10.239 --> 00:15:14.239
Caption: avoid the cyber pearl harbor or the

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.880
Caption: cyber titanic

00:15:14.239 --> 00:15:18.958
Caption: but if you look at the safety industry

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.799
Caption: whilst it has helped prevent some of the

00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:23.440
Caption: major catastrophes

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:24.320
Caption: events are still happening all the time

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.518
Caption: so

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.759
Caption: if regulation is the minimum expectation

00:15:27.518 --> 00:15:32.239
Caption: of what we should all be doing what does

00:15:29.758 --> 00:15:34.398
Caption: best practice look like what is our hope

00:15:32.239 --> 00:15:36.799
Caption: for the future

00:15:34.398 --> 00:15:38.638
Caption: um and bearing in mind uh hat tip to

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:40.880
Caption: devsecops we&#39;re sort of responsible for

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:43.278
Caption: everything as well right so this is

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.679
Caption: interesting for me i feel to explore

00:15:43.278 --> 00:15:48.078
Caption: what can we learn about cutting-edge

00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:48.078
Caption: thinking

00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:54.719
Caption: so my husband introduced me to human and

00:15:51.198 --> 00:15:57.838
Caption: organizational performance known as hop

00:15:54.719 --> 00:15:59.359
Caption: and essentially incidents become

00:15:57.838 --> 00:16:02.559
Caption: learning events

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:04.880
Caption: and the incidents are explored through

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:06.958
Caption: learning teams

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.799
Caption: and there are five core principles which

00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:11.039
Caption: you&#39;ll walk through now just to cement

00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:13.838
Caption: the foundation of this in your mind

00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:16.000
Caption: and if you leave this room today taking

00:16:13.838 --> 00:16:17.679
Caption: nothing away from what i&#39;ve said please

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.479
Caption: make sure that in your work and your

00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:22.958
Caption: companies from monday onwards if you

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:25.440
Caption: ever see anybody put root cause equals

00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:28.320
Caption: human error you challenge them and you

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:31.359
Caption: don&#39;t let that lie

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.199
Caption: so what is a principle number one humans

00:16:31.359 --> 00:16:36.320
Caption: people are fallible

00:16:33.198 --> 00:16:39.198
Caption: we make mistakes to er is human this is

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.518
Caption: a 300 year old quote it&#39;s not new it&#39;s

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:43.440
Caption: not controversial um we&#39;re always going

00:16:41.518 --> 00:16:45.119
Caption: to make mistakes we do them on average

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.599
Caption: seven times an hour which is why your

00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:48.559
Caption: backspace key is so shiny

00:16:47.599 --> 00:16:50.239
Caption: um

00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:53.278
Caption: human error just simply isn&#39;t

00:16:50.239 --> 00:16:55.198
Caption: interesting and we just really shouldn&#39;t

00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:57.440
Caption: be surprised when people are making

00:16:55.198 --> 00:17:00.159
Caption: mistakes

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.239
Caption: um what can we do as a community here

00:17:00.159 --> 00:17:03.919
Caption: well we can look at ways to remove the

00:17:02.239 --> 00:17:05.599
Caption: need for human involvement in the first

00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:08.078
Caption: place therefore reducing the chance of a

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:10.160
Caption: human error things like

00:17:08.078 --> 00:17:11.760
Caption: standardize your programming languages

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.838
Caption: to be ones that are compatible with the

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.919
Caption: security scanning systems

00:17:13.838 --> 00:17:17.520
Caption: use reference patterns use repeatable

00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:20.880
Caption: tried and tested approaches in your

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.078
Caption: designs automate all of the things all

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.719
Caption: of the time

00:17:22.078 --> 00:17:27.198
Caption: and use things like paved pathways with

00:17:24.719 --> 00:17:30.000
Caption: checkpoints and brake build and guard

00:17:27.198 --> 00:17:33.839
Caption: rails to help reduce the point of a

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.839
Caption: human decision or a human involvement

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:38.239
Caption: principle number two error likely

00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:39.439
Caption: conditions are in fact present

00:17:38.239 --> 00:17:41.439
Caption: predictable

00:17:39.439 --> 00:17:44.399
Caption: so although you don&#39;t necessarily know

00:17:41.439 --> 00:17:46.558
Caption: when an error is going to happen

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.919
Caption: you&#39;re actually quite good at figuring

00:17:46.558 --> 00:17:51.520
Caption: out where an error might happen

00:17:49.918 --> 00:17:54.079
Caption: so what we can start to do in our

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.679
Caption: workplace is learn to recognize what is

00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:57.678
Caption: an error likely condition

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.640
Caption: in pubs across the world irish pubs

00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:04.558
Caption: you&#39;ll see signs like this

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.280
Caption: how many of you know

00:18:04.558 --> 00:18:09.199
Caption: where you need to go to the restroom

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.440
Caption: when faced with that sign

00:18:09.199 --> 00:18:12.959
Caption: and how many of you would know after two

00:18:11.439 --> 00:18:16.000
Caption: or three guinnesses

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:18.558
Caption: this is an error likely situation

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.119
Caption: we can improve upon the design

00:18:18.558 --> 00:18:22.558
Caption: by adding a little bit more insight

00:18:21.119 --> 00:18:24.239
Caption: and just because you&#39;ve improved your

00:18:22.558 --> 00:18:26.399
Caption: design once doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t

00:18:24.239 --> 00:18:28.000
Caption: continue to improve and give people a

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.559
Caption: fighting chance to go where they really

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.119
Caption: mean to go

00:18:30.558 --> 00:18:33.839
Caption: um in the same place of

00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:36.079
Caption: of

00:18:33.839 --> 00:18:38.319
Caption: security that there are error likely

00:18:36.079 --> 00:18:40.880
Caption: situations everywhere this is the

00:18:38.319 --> 00:18:43.839
Caption: devsecops infinity loop with all the

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.199
Caption: security services that we could offer

00:18:43.839 --> 00:18:46.719
Caption: um and so

00:18:45.199 --> 00:18:48.159
Caption: knowing that people are likely to make

00:18:46.719 --> 00:18:49.918
Caption: mistakes in their planning phase we

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.919
Caption: offer the security architecture

00:18:49.918 --> 00:18:53.678
Caption: assessment and review knowing that

00:18:51.918 --> 00:18:56.558
Caption: people are likely to introduce errors

00:18:53.678 --> 00:18:58.880
Caption: into their code we do manual code review

00:18:56.558 --> 00:19:00.558
Caption: and knowing that secure code reviewers

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.199
Caption: are humans and are liable to make

00:19:00.558 --> 00:19:04.959
Caption: mistakes we do automated secure code

00:19:03.199 --> 00:19:06.798
Caption: reviews um

00:19:04.959 --> 00:19:08.479
Caption: i probably could stay on this slide for

00:19:06.798 --> 00:19:10.319
Caption: about four hours but noting we&#39;re

00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:11.520
Caption: running a little late i&#39;m going to scoot

00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:13.759
Caption: on to

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.640
Caption: number three which is that individual

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.558
Caption: behaviors are influenced

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:22.079
Caption: i think anyone who&#39;s ever sent their kid

00:19:18.558 --> 00:19:25.359
Caption: to daycare can really relate to this one

00:19:22.079 --> 00:19:26.640
Caption: behavior is a result of both beliefs and

00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:28.479
Caption: attitudes

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.479
Caption: and it&#39;s also formed by what we&#39;re

00:19:28.479 --> 00:19:32.798
Caption: getting exposed to

00:19:30.479 --> 00:19:34.400
Caption: so at an afl match

00:19:32.798 --> 00:19:36.079
Caption: most people would feel comfortable to

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.559
Caption: shout loudly

00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:40.479
Caption: but i suspect the majority of us would

00:19:38.558 --> 00:19:42.719
Caption: not feel comfortable to shout loudly in

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:44.079
Caption: a place of worship

00:19:42.719 --> 00:19:46.880
Caption: how do i translate this into the

00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:50.239
Caption: workplace well one of the most common

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.719
Caption: things that i see is presenteeism

00:19:50.239 --> 00:19:55.520
Caption: you are in your office everyone around

00:19:52.719 --> 00:19:56.640
Caption: you is working for 14 hours a day

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.400
Caption: you are going to feel a bit

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.719
Caption: uncomfortable trying to get up after

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.559
Caption: eight hours

00:20:00.719 --> 00:20:05.280
Caption: what is happening

00:20:02.558 --> 00:20:07.119
Caption: is because around you they&#39;ve normalized

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.880
Caption: the experience of staying in the office

00:20:07.119 --> 00:20:10.479
Caption: for long hours regardless of the fact

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.839
Caption: you all signed up for your eight hour

00:20:10.479 --> 00:20:14.400
Caption: contracts

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:16.719
Caption: you&#39;re drifting away from the expected

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:19.520
Caption: process

00:20:16.719 --> 00:20:21.038
Caption: and that&#39;s one of the key elements about

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.119
Caption: these human and organizational

00:20:21.038 --> 00:20:25.279
Caption: performance the hop principles and the

00:20:23.119 --> 00:20:27.280
Caption: process is looking for points where

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.000
Caption: you&#39;re you&#39;re drifting away from what

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.080
Caption: you&#39;re expected to do

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.880
Caption: so let&#39;s bring that to security

00:20:32.079 --> 00:20:36.798
Caption: i see many amazing developers disabling

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.918
Caption: their security scanning in their build

00:20:36.798 --> 00:20:41.199
Caption: pipelines

00:20:37.918 --> 00:20:43.439
Caption: um because arguably the security tests

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:44.959
Caption: apparently take too long to run and

00:20:43.439 --> 00:20:47.199
Caption: we&#39;ll probably find vulnerabilities

00:20:44.959 --> 00:20:49.678
Caption: which are going to take some time to fix

00:20:47.199 --> 00:20:52.319
Caption: so you see a behavior that is normalized

00:20:49.678 --> 00:20:53.839
Caption: of prioritizing ship to production as

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:56.399
Caption: fast and as quickly as possible

00:20:53.839 --> 00:20:58.558
Caption: regardless of the quality of the product

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.880
Caption: and when management repeatedly accepts

00:20:58.558 --> 00:21:03.439
Caption: the risk they&#39;re reinforcing this

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.520
Caption: behavior so the black line is what the

00:21:03.439 --> 00:21:07.599
Caption: security department thinks you&#39;re doing

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.520
Caption: the blue line is what you&#39;re actually

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:11.199
Caption: doing which will have all those points

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.558
Caption: of deviation which may have been

00:21:11.199 --> 00:21:16.319
Caption: normalized in your workplace and 99

00:21:14.558 --> 00:21:18.640
Caption: times out of 100 you&#39;re gonna get away

00:21:16.319 --> 00:21:20.798
Caption: with it because we converge at the end

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.799
Caption: but there is a lot of inherent risk in

00:21:20.798 --> 00:21:25.119
Caption: what has actually happened versus what

00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:27.678
Caption: the ivory tower security team believes

00:21:25.119 --> 00:21:27.678
Caption: is happening

00:21:28.159 --> 00:21:34.400
Caption: principle number four operational upsets

00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:37.119
Caption: can be avoided aka pearl harbor cyber

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:40.640
Caption: pearl harbor is not actually inevitable

00:21:37.119 --> 00:21:43.119
Caption: we can design resilient i.t systems

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:46.239
Caption: so we learn from our past events

00:21:43.119 --> 00:21:48.959
Caption: we model cyber security risks engage

00:21:46.239 --> 00:21:51.678
Caption: cyber security professionals

00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:54.319
Caption: and design your scenarios and your

00:21:51.678 --> 00:21:56.319
Caption: systems to have risk as low as

00:21:54.319 --> 00:21:57.439
Caption: reasonably practical

00:21:56.319 --> 00:21:59.759
Caption: so

00:21:57.439 --> 00:22:01.439
Caption: this family are off an adventure one

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.239
Caption: flat tire is not going to spoil their

00:22:01.439 --> 00:22:04.158
Caption: fun

00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:06.079
Caption: given where they&#39;re going they&#39;ve

00:22:04.159 --> 00:22:07.840
Caption: determined that having the second spare

00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:11.359
Caption: tire the cost benefit of that second

00:22:07.839 --> 00:22:13.760
Caption: spare tyre is reasonable and practical

00:22:11.359 --> 00:22:15.599
Caption: so what does it look like for us at work

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.199
Caption: well how many people here have got a

00:22:15.599 --> 00:22:19.038
Caption: magnet on their fridge that tells them

00:22:17.199 --> 00:22:22.239
Caption: who to phone when their child or family

00:22:19.038 --> 00:22:23.759
Caption: member gets sick or unwell

00:22:22.239 --> 00:22:25.918
Caption: how many of you got something that tells

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.678
Caption: you who to phone at work when you&#39;re

00:22:25.918 --> 00:22:29.599
Caption: working at home and your system has just

00:22:27.678 --> 00:22:31.678
Caption: got ransomware and you can&#39;t even log in

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:33.119
Caption: to figure out who the phone number to

00:22:31.678 --> 00:22:35.199
Caption: are

00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:37.359
Caption: we don&#39;t necessarily plan for the

00:22:35.199 --> 00:22:40.079
Caption: disaster scenario particularly well but

00:22:37.359 --> 00:22:41.599
Caption: the health and safety guys have brought

00:22:40.079 --> 00:22:43.038
Caption: that mindset through to the industries

00:22:41.599 --> 00:22:44.640
Caption: they work with

00:22:43.038 --> 00:22:47.519
Caption: so they will plan

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:50.479
Caption: for the emergency situation and it

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.479
Caption: allows them to contain and control it as

00:22:50.479 --> 00:22:55.918
Caption: much as they possibly can and reduce the

00:22:52.479 --> 00:23:00.079
Caption: potential scope of a catastrophe

00:22:55.918 --> 00:23:01.759
Caption: so they plan the emergency they document

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:04.000
Caption: every single step that every person

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.479
Caption: should follow in that situation

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.959
Caption: they print out and laminate copies of

00:23:06.479 --> 00:23:11.520
Caption: contact details and processes

00:23:08.959 --> 00:23:13.359
Caption: and they also run tabletop exercises to

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.679
Caption: increase familiarity

00:23:13.359 --> 00:23:17.918
Caption: we see so many times when we go into

00:23:15.678 --> 00:23:19.918
Caption: companies and there&#39;s been an incident

00:23:17.918 --> 00:23:22.158
Caption: the first thing that the human tries to

00:23:19.918 --> 00:23:23.759
Caption: do is is that oh god i&#39;ve got to fix

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:26.080
Caption: this and they try and restore and

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.199
Caption: recover and get services running for the

00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:29.119
Caption: customer

00:23:27.199 --> 00:23:31.359
Caption: um but actually one of the things that

00:23:29.119 --> 00:23:33.520
Caption: we really wish people would do is pause

00:23:31.359 --> 00:23:36.319
Caption: and take a forensic snapshot because

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:38.558
Caption: that can give you insight into maybe how

00:23:36.319 --> 00:23:40.558
Caption: you got compromised by the criminals and

00:23:38.558 --> 00:23:42.479
Caption: what they&#39;ve taken and i tell you

00:23:40.558 --> 00:23:44.399
Caption: knowing those two pieces of information

00:23:42.479 --> 00:23:48.400
Caption: will save you weeks of worry and

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.400
Caption: heartache and extra work downstream

00:23:48.719 --> 00:23:52.640
Caption: and our fifth principle which is

00:23:50.239 --> 00:23:55.439
Caption: management response to failure this

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.599
Caption: really matters responding negatively is

00:23:55.439 --> 00:24:00.000
Caption: going to lead to undesirable behaviors

00:23:57.599 --> 00:24:01.359
Caption: and it will hinder our ability to learn

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.719
Caption: and grow

00:24:01.359 --> 00:24:09.038
Caption: so you can blame and punish you can

00:24:04.719 --> 00:24:11.199
Caption: learn and improve but you cannot do both

00:24:09.038 --> 00:24:14.479
Caption: and management needs to recognize that

00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:17.038
Caption: learning is real work it&#39;s legitimate

00:24:14.479 --> 00:24:19.278
Caption: worthwhile use of our time

00:24:17.038 --> 00:24:21.439
Caption: and people need to be able to report and

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:23.679
Caption: feel that they&#39;re in a safe space no

00:24:21.439 --> 00:24:25.519
Caption: reprisal and discuss

00:24:23.678 --> 00:24:27.439
Caption: where maybe those points of drift have

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.719
Caption: occurred

00:24:27.439 --> 00:24:31.359
Caption: okay so

00:24:28.719 --> 00:24:33.199
Caption: those are the core principles of hop

00:24:31.359 --> 00:24:35.199
Caption: what do we do with that in our mind how

00:24:33.199 --> 00:24:38.079
Caption: do we maybe translate some of these

00:24:35.199 --> 00:24:40.558
Caption: security safety analogies into something

00:24:38.079 --> 00:24:42.479
Caption: that in cyber security we could run with

00:24:40.558 --> 00:24:44.640
Caption: from tomorrow

00:24:42.479 --> 00:24:47.678
Caption: we are going to look at the idea of a

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:51.119
Caption: learning team

00:24:47.678 --> 00:24:53.278
Caption: this is where events are explored based

00:24:51.119 --> 00:24:55.279
Caption: on their potential severity so the first

00:24:53.279 --> 00:24:57.039
Caption: thing the safety professionals recognize

00:24:55.279 --> 00:25:00.159
Caption: is that a near miss

00:24:57.038 --> 00:25:02.000
Caption: is as informative as the real deal and

00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:04.480
Caption: quite often the only difference between

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.159
Caption: a near miss and an event is just sheer

00:25:04.479 --> 00:25:08.158
Caption: bad luck

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:10.799
Caption: we&#39;ve actually got a lot to be learned

00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:12.480
Caption: from those potentially

00:25:10.798 --> 00:25:14.719
Caption: potential events with potential high

00:25:12.479 --> 00:25:16.400
Caption: severity and the other thing is it has

00:25:14.719 --> 00:25:18.400
Caption: to be key that there is something to

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.799
Caption: learn so you don&#39;t do it when it&#39;s

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:23.039
Caption: simple and obvious like

00:25:20.798 --> 00:25:26.000
Caption: why would you run a learning team for

00:25:23.038 --> 00:25:27.759
Caption: person clicks on sms scam

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.678
Caption: we&#39;ve got nothing to learn from the fact

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.440
Caption: that people are curious

00:25:29.678 --> 00:25:33.278
Caption: and intrigued and click on stuff they

00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:35.839
Caption: shouldn&#39;t like we figured that one out a

00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:38.080
Caption: long time ago what we could do is apply

00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:40.239
Caption: energies to stop the sms from reaching

00:25:38.079 --> 00:25:42.959
Caption: that person in the first place

00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:45.278
Caption: like the cleaner pipes initiative

00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:47.359
Caption: so we want to run a learning team when

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:49.919
Caption: there is a potentially high severity

00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:52.000
Caption: nature to the near miss or the event and

00:25:49.918 --> 00:25:53.359
Caption: also when we haven&#39;t figured out

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.880
Caption: everything about it we&#39;ve still got

00:25:53.359 --> 00:25:57.359
Caption: something to learn we&#39;re still confused

00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.000
Caption: by what&#39;s going on

00:25:57.359 --> 00:26:01.359
Caption: how do we run the learning teams well we

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.760
Caption: mentioned that management response to

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:05.760
Caption: failure is really critical management

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.520
Caption: buy-in to this kind of concept is also

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.839
Caption: really important because we&#39;re going to

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.919
Caption: need them to sponsor the event these

00:26:09.839 --> 00:26:13.599
Caption: things don&#39;t happen in the standard one

00:26:11.918 --> 00:26:15.359
Caption: and a half hours to two hours of your

00:26:13.599 --> 00:26:18.959
Caption: post-incident review meeting that you

00:26:15.359 --> 00:26:20.079
Caption: used to these things run on for two days

00:26:18.959 --> 00:26:22.079
Caption: and they run on for two days for a

00:26:20.079 --> 00:26:23.359
Caption: couple of reasons first of all is it

00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:25.678
Caption: gets you out of that rabbit in

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:27.839
Caption: headlights moment if you&#39;re in a pir and

00:26:25.678 --> 00:26:30.319
Caption: you&#39;re put on the spot to think and have

00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:32.959
Caption: all the answers and be creative there&#39;s

00:26:30.319 --> 00:26:34.880
Caption: that kind of panic or or frozen

00:26:32.959 --> 00:26:37.038
Caption: experience that you get and it&#39;s

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.279
Caption: preventing you from allowing the ideas

00:26:37.038 --> 00:26:40.798
Caption: to flow and the other one which i&#39;m sure

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:42.960
Caption: loads of you have experienced is that

00:26:40.798 --> 00:26:45.119
Caption: eureka moment where you step away from

00:26:42.959 --> 00:26:46.558
Caption: the situation or your desk and you

00:26:45.119 --> 00:26:47.918
Caption: you could be out for a walk it could be

00:26:46.558 --> 00:26:50.239
Caption: in the shower and it just suddenly that

00:26:47.918 --> 00:26:52.079
Caption: moment strikes you and you realize i

00:26:50.239 --> 00:26:53.520
Caption: know what i need to do i don&#39;t know if

00:26:52.079 --> 00:26:54.880
Caption: it&#39;s called soak time because you&#39;re in

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.599
Caption: the shower but

00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.079
Caption: there is that concept of taking time to

00:26:57.599 --> 00:27:02.158
Caption: experience something you can be even

00:27:00.079 --> 00:27:03.119
Caption: more creative and thoughtful

00:27:02.159 --> 00:27:04.640
Caption: so

00:27:03.119 --> 00:27:07.119
Caption: another part of how we learn the teams

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:09.119
Caption: is we get the right people into the room

00:27:07.119 --> 00:27:10.000
Caption: and we gather collected people who&#39;ve

00:27:09.119 --> 00:27:12.719
Caption: got

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.119
Caption: related and tangential and also direct

00:27:12.719 --> 00:27:16.880
Caption: experience of the processes and the

00:27:15.119 --> 00:27:18.399
Caption: systems that might have been involved

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.640
Caption: and on the screen here you&#39;ve got ted

00:27:18.399 --> 00:27:21.760
Caption: lasso&#39;s diamond dogs

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.279
Caption: actually that&#39;s the second thing you

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.119
Caption: need to take away from my presentation

00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:26.880
Caption: today go watch ted lasso it&#39;s the best

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:29.279
Caption: thing in the world

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.199
Caption: this is a fabulous learning team in

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:32.960
Caption: action they&#39;ve got a player they&#39;ve got

00:27:31.199 --> 00:27:34.880
Caption: a coach with related experience from a

00:27:32.959 --> 00:27:36.719
Caption: different sport they&#39;ve got an

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.399
Caption: operationals manager they&#39;ve got the

00:27:36.719 --> 00:27:41.038
Caption: locker room attendant and they&#39;ve got

00:27:38.399 --> 00:27:44.239
Caption: the remarkable ted lasso who creates a

00:27:41.038 --> 00:27:45.599
Caption: wonderful safe space for them to explore

00:27:44.239 --> 00:27:47.119
Caption: ideas

00:27:45.599 --> 00:27:49.119
Caption: and another thing is to have a third

00:27:47.119 --> 00:27:51.918
Caption: party facilitator so have someone in the

00:27:49.119 --> 00:27:53.918
Caption: room who has no bias

00:27:51.918 --> 00:27:55.759
Caption: what we find through the classic five

00:27:53.918 --> 00:27:57.839
Caption: wires of incident investigation is

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.919
Caption: humans tend to have a belief about what

00:27:57.839 --> 00:28:02.880
Caption: they think has happened and they will

00:27:59.918 --> 00:28:04.639
Caption: drill down to make sure it lands and

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.918
Caption: reconfirms their biased starting

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.599
Caption: position

00:28:05.918 --> 00:28:09.439
Caption: and that third-party external

00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:11.678
Caption: facilitator will help you

00:28:09.439 --> 00:28:12.479
Caption: to create that safe space by reducing

00:28:11.678 --> 00:28:15.519
Caption: this

00:28:12.479 --> 00:28:17.278
Caption: fear of blame and reprisal

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.279
Caption: and like i said scheduling these things

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:20.799
Caption: it&#39;s a two-day thing i mean i still

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:22.240
Caption: actually stand here on stage and say we

00:28:20.798 --> 00:28:24.000
Caption: should do this and struggle to believe

00:28:22.239 --> 00:28:27.199
Caption: that this is what we should do like who

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.199
Caption: gives up two days to anything in

00:28:27.199 --> 00:28:31.359
Caption: it&#39;s tricky right

00:28:29.199 --> 00:28:32.880
Caption: what would the two days start with so

00:28:31.359 --> 00:28:36.158
Caption: you&#39;d be on day one you&#39;d be talking

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.760
Caption: about anything except the actual event

00:28:36.159 --> 00:28:39.919
Caption: and one of the things you can do is to

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.839
Caption: open up the dialogue and ask people what

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:43.839
Caption: are you upset about right now

00:28:41.839 --> 00:28:45.839
Caption: get it off your chest just have a rant

00:28:43.839 --> 00:28:47.119
Caption: get on your soapbox go for gold and

00:28:45.839 --> 00:28:48.719
Caption: you&#39;ll get they don&#39;t approve my

00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:50.399
Caption: timesheets on time i hate the chocolate

00:28:48.719 --> 00:28:52.239
Caption: in the vending machine and another thing

00:28:50.399 --> 00:28:54.000
Caption: and another thing and once you&#39;ve got

00:28:52.239 --> 00:28:56.319
Caption: through that you&#39;ve created a safe space

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.479
Caption: where people where humans feel listened

00:28:56.319 --> 00:29:01.119
Caption: to and that their opinion counts

00:28:58.479 --> 00:29:03.038
Caption: they are so much more likely to feel

00:29:01.119 --> 00:29:05.520
Caption: that they can contribute and that their

00:29:03.038 --> 00:29:07.038
Caption: contribution is going to be valuable

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.558
Caption: and you take time to understand how

00:29:07.038 --> 00:29:11.119
Caption: their job is done

00:29:08.558 --> 00:29:12.479
Caption: remember the drift like that&#39;s how the

00:29:11.119 --> 00:29:14.558
Caption: job is done it doesn&#39;t matter what the

00:29:12.479 --> 00:29:16.959
Caption: process says it was at this stage we

00:29:14.558 --> 00:29:19.520
Caption: need to uncover the points of drift

00:29:16.959 --> 00:29:21.439
Caption: and i know we all do this avoid going

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.279
Caption: into your solution instant problem

00:29:21.439 --> 00:29:25.678
Caption: solving mode

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:28.240
Caption: and then on day two that&#39;s when you move

00:29:25.678 --> 00:29:31.199
Caption: the focus to the actual event itself so

00:29:28.239 --> 00:29:33.119
Caption: all of day one is is nothing that is

00:29:31.199 --> 00:29:35.599
Caption: focused on the thing that&#39;s caused you

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:38.079
Caption: even to convene this learning team

00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:40.319
Caption: and you&#39;re drilling down into how do you

00:29:38.079 --> 00:29:41.839
Caption: do what you do you cover the walls with

00:29:40.319 --> 00:29:44.079
Caption: whiteboard

00:29:41.839 --> 00:29:46.558
Caption: scribbles or post-it notes and you map

00:29:44.079 --> 00:29:48.880
Caption: out how each person does their job for

00:29:46.558 --> 00:29:50.239
Caption: real life

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.760
Caption: and what are the outcomes from a

00:29:50.239 --> 00:29:54.319
Caption: learning team

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:57.039
Caption: so you&#39;re looking at something that is

00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:58.959
Caption: identifying how the job is done and how

00:29:57.038 --> 00:30:01.038
Caption: it can be done better

00:29:58.959 --> 00:30:03.839
Caption: you are acknowledging that people will

00:30:01.038 --> 00:30:06.319
Caption: drift away from the defined process

00:30:03.839 --> 00:30:08.398
Caption: and that&#39;s often because the processes

00:30:06.319 --> 00:30:10.398
Caption: are just unrealistic they&#39;re just

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:12.000
Caption: unworkable but no one&#39;s managed to

00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:13.840
Caption: figure out how to communicate that to

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.479
Caption: the person that wrote the process

00:30:13.839 --> 00:30:18.319
Caption: and you find better ways to do the work

00:30:16.479 --> 00:30:20.398
Caption: and you share those learnings as widely

00:30:18.319 --> 00:30:23.839
Caption: as you can to

00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:25.520
Caption: reduce the likelihood of reoccurrence

00:30:23.839 --> 00:30:26.959
Caption: simple there you go to solve all the

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.399
Caption: problems

00:30:26.959 --> 00:30:31.199
Caption: in summary

00:30:28.399 --> 00:30:33.600
Caption: so we are on the battlefield we are

00:30:31.199 --> 00:30:35.599
Caption: facing existential threats

00:30:33.599 --> 00:30:37.278
Caption: we have got ransomware increasing at an

00:30:35.599 --> 00:30:39.119
Caption: alarming rate and you can buy it for a

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:42.000
Caption: couple of dollars and you don&#39;t need any

00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:46.479
Caption: technical skill to kick it into action

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.038
Caption: and a cyber pearl harbor is imminent

00:30:46.479 --> 00:30:51.359
Caption: we&#39;ve learned that humans will

00:30:49.038 --> 00:30:53.278
Caption: look for a leader and hand over their

00:30:51.359 --> 00:30:54.558
Caption: agency to someone who has all the

00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:56.799
Caption: answers

00:30:54.558 --> 00:30:59.518
Caption: we can see that right now australian

00:30:56.798 --> 00:31:02.398
Caption: sentiment has shifted complementary to

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:04.559
Caption: that and that 70 of us would be more

00:31:02.399 --> 00:31:07.200
Caption: comfortable doing that

00:31:04.558 --> 00:31:10.640
Caption: and we all know where that leads

00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:13.038
Caption: quite the thing to live in fear isn&#39;t it

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.279
Caption: but not wanting to give up hope

00:31:13.038 --> 00:31:16.879
Caption: we&#39;ve had a look at there may be a place

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:19.519
Caption: for regulation

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.079
Caption: and it has had some positive effects but

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:23.919
Caption: there&#39;s also examples of where

00:31:22.079 --> 00:31:27.678
Caption: maybe the regulation has been more for

00:31:23.918 --> 00:31:29.038
Caption: the outcry than the actual event itself

00:31:27.678 --> 00:31:31.760
Caption: and then we&#39;ve had a look at the world

00:31:29.038 --> 00:31:34.239
Caption: of human and organizational performance

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:36.000
Caption: we&#39;ve moved away from blaming and

00:31:34.239 --> 00:31:38.319
Caption: shaming and

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.640
Caption: human error as a root cause and incident

00:31:38.319 --> 00:31:43.439
Caption: investigations and the five wise which

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:45.440
Caption: is the blunt tool of blame and we&#39;ve had

00:31:43.439 --> 00:31:47.599
Caption: a look at maybe we changed the dialogue

00:31:45.439 --> 00:31:49.038
Caption: we accept that human make mistake it&#39;s

00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:50.959
Caption: not going to surprise us there&#39;s nothing

00:31:49.038 --> 00:31:53.518
Caption: new to learn from that

00:31:50.959 --> 00:31:56.239
Caption: we get people together we make a safe

00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:58.320
Caption: space inclusive multiple different

00:31:56.239 --> 00:32:01.519
Caption: diverse points of view are welcome and

00:31:58.319 --> 00:32:03.518
Caption: we run a learning team and we genuinely

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:05.679
Caption: are working on learning for the best

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:07.919
Caption: benefit of the whole

00:32:05.678 --> 00:32:10.079
Caption: and with that maybe we have this

00:32:07.918 --> 00:32:12.000
Caption: opportunity so please don&#39;t give over

00:32:10.079 --> 00:32:14.000
Caption: your agency just yet

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.359
Caption: come together create and promote those

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.079
Caption: safe spaces

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:22.000
Caption: work together following those principles

00:32:18.079 --> 00:32:24.000
Caption: and who knows maybe we&#39;ll survive or or

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.839
Caption: not even have to deal with a cyber pearl

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.079
Caption: harbor of our own

00:32:25.839 --> 00:32:29.079
Caption: thank you
