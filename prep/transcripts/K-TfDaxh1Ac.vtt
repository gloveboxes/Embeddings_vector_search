Caption: and dave is going to teach us all about

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.159

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:17.439
Caption: i love mobile update so i&#39;m really

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:21.840

Caption: so i&#39;m here today to talk to you about

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:32.159
Caption: mobile app development specifically

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:34.718
Caption: cross-platform development

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.000
Caption: what that is and why it can be useful a

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.440
Caption: quick bit of housekeeping i won&#39;t be

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.799
Caption: taking any questions due to the length

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:40.479
Caption: of the talk but feel free to approach

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:42.000
Caption: either myself or any of my adapter

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:43.200
Caption: colleagues who are all milling about at

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.639
Caption: the front here

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.159
Caption: and we can answer any questions later on

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:49.919
Caption: i&#39;d like to take a quick chance to thank

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.959
Caption: our sponsors without their support we

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:55.038
Caption: wouldn&#39;t all be here today

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:57.439
Caption: so i&#39;d like to ask you the audience a

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.120
Caption: few quick questions before we start

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:02.159
Caption: could you raise your hands in the air if

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:02.159
Caption: you&#39;ve got a mobile phone

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.880
Caption: md knock with our hand up could you keep

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:08.639
Caption: your hands up

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:11.199
Caption: if you&#39;ve ever used an application on

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:14.080
Caption: that phone

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:14.798
Caption: everyone keep your hands up still last

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.639
Caption: one

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.799
Caption: if you&#39;ve ever downloaded an app from an

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:21.919
Caption: app store

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.080
Caption: i think that&#39;s pretty much everyone

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:25.599
Caption: apps are part of everyday life now

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.560
Caption: whether it&#39;s photo editing

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:29.519
Caption: watching movies reading comic books

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:32.239
Caption: house hunting

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:33.679
Caption: vr or angry birds we all use them pretty

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:35.279
Caption: much every single day

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.360
Caption: they&#39;ve also become vital to many

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:39.519
Caption: businesses unfortunately

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.559
Caption: they can be expensive in terms of cost

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:42.639
Caption: and time

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:45.118
Caption: that&#39;s where cross-platform technology

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.119
Caption: can come in

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:48.319
Caption: so i&#39;m going to try and answer these

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.000
Caption: three questions today what is

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.239
Caption: cross-platform development

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.599
Caption: is it useful and which solution is for

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.199
Caption: me

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.879
Caption: but before i do that i&#39;m going to take a

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:59.360
Caption: short trip back in time

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:01.599
Caption: prior to 2007 smartphones looked like

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.599
Caption: this

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.360
Caption: not very pretty they tended to they had

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:08.160
Caption: hardware keyboards some used styluses a

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.679
Caption: few had

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.520
Caption: touch screens but they were slow and

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.160
Caption: unresponsive

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.598
Caption: the sdks weren&#39;t open you couldn&#39;t get

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.120
Caption: your apps onto these phones and there

00:02:15.598 --> 00:02:19.679
Caption: wasn&#39;t anything

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:21.199
Caption: even approaching an app store and then

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:24.159
Caption: january 2007

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:26.319
Caption: this happened steve jobs walked on stage

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.279
Caption: and announced the iphone

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.160
Caption: with its shiny shiny case its responsive

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.639
Caption: clear

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.319
Caption: colorful display and its clever

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.080
Caption: marketing the iphone caught the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.279
Caption: imagination of both the public and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.040
Caption: developers

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:41.360
Caption: sadly for developers at this point in

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:44.159
Caption: time there was no sdk for this phone

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.440
Caption: you couldn&#39;t get your apps onto it at

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.639
Caption: this point the only apps you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.559
Caption: had on it were the basic ones safari

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:53.919
Caption: email contacts pretty boring stuff

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:56.000
Caption: apple are the trick up the sleeves

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.479
Caption: though they were already using their own

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.720
Caption: language

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.399
Caption: objective c to build applications for

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.319
Caption: their mac platform

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:05.199
Caption: and they had their own ide to develop

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:09.199
Caption: this xcode

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:12.639
Caption: in march 2008 they really released xcode

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:14.479
Caption: with the ios sdk built in suddenly you

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.238
Caption: could start making apps for this amazing

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:17.679
Caption: new device

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:19.279
Caption: at the same time they launched the app

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:21.679
Caption: store the first of its kind

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:24.639
Caption: this allowed you to deploy your apps

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:26.559
Caption: worldwide with minimal effort

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.798
Caption: but the close of 2009 there were already

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:31.199
Caption: 50 000 applications in the app store

00:03:28.798 --> 00:03:34.319
Caption: today there are more than 2.2 million

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:36.798
Caption: ios applications

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.720
Caption: late 2008 these guys came along google

00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:40.639
Caption: released android which is based on the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.479
Caption: portable java language

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.679
Caption: at the same time they released their own

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:46.319
Caption: play store

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.518
Caption: very similar to the app store 2.6

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.518
Caption: million android apps

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:51.119
Caption: at the moment there were others such as

00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:52.479
Caption: blackberry and the ill-fated windows

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:53.759
Caption: phone but they were crushed under the

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.039
Caption: might of apple and google

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:57.598
Caption: and these two have been battling out

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:57.598
Caption: ever since

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.958
Caption: moving forward in 2014 apple released

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:02.479
Caption: swift

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.919
Caption: which was designed to be a cleaner

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.878
Caption: quicker and more modern programming

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.238
Caption: language

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:07.839
Caption: it was backwards compatible with

00:04:06.238 --> 00:04:09.438
Caption: objective c and at the same time they

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:10.238
Caption: released playgrounds which allowed you

00:04:09.438 --> 00:04:13.119
Caption: to do

00:04:10.238 --> 00:04:15.039
Caption: quick prototype development with swift

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:16.320
Caption: android still uses java to this day

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.078
Caption: however a lot of people have started

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.440
Caption: moving towards kotlin

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.519
Caption: kotlin was developed by the company

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.360
Caption: jetbrains and this was designed to be a

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.040
Caption: modern alternative to java with features

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:28.638
Caption: such as null safety

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.440
Caption: better generics and data classes

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.399
Caption: so this goes to where we are today two

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.639
Caption: platforms

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:36.959
Caption: both completely different clients often

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.479
Caption: ask us for a price for one platform

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:40.319
Caption: then it asks us for the price for the

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.040
Caption: second one and we say

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.839
Caption: it&#39;s the same as the first one and they

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.279
Caption: get sad faces

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.519
Caption: the reason for this is there&#39;s no

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:51.119
Caption: sharing between these platforms

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:52.479
Caption: completely different languages

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:53.199
Caption: completely different development

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.679
Caption: platforms

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.040
Caption: and two means of laying out the ux

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:58.720
Caption: that&#39;s before we actually get into the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.800
Caption: platform specific differences such as

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.119
Caption: differences in navigation how they treat

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:05.119
Caption: push notifications sensors screen

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:06.479
Caption: resolutions the list goes on

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:08.320
Caption: companies were forced to hire two

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.320
Caption: different teams to develop their apps

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.960
Caption: or try and find the mythical creature of

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.800
Caption: the dev who&#39;s good at both

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:16.479
Caption: we started looking ways to count cut

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:19.599
Caption: this cost and devs

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.959
Caption: started looking for shortcuts

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.039
Caption: one of the first solutions to this

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:26.959
Caption: was apache cordova previously known as

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.519
Caption: phonegap this is based upon web

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:31.039
Caption: technologies such as html5 css and

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:32.479
Caption: javascript

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.320
Caption: familiar to anybody who&#39;s built a

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.479
Caption: website

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.080
Caption: this allows you to run on pretty much

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.160
Caption: any device that&#39;s got a

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:43.758
Caption: a web browser as web to native layer

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.679
Caption: which allows you to access things such

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.839
Caption: as accelerometer camera and local

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:49.600
Caption: storage

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:51.440
Caption: later on other platforms are built on

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.000
Caption: top of this such as ionic which gave you

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.119
Caption: access to

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.880
Caption: angular and react again very familiar to

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:59.199
Caption: anybody who&#39;s done web development

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.559
Caption: this makes this platform really good for

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:04.399
Caption: teams that have already

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:05.919
Caption: web development capabilities

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:07.359
Caption: because you&#39;re building a browser you

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.959
Caption: can use hot reloading you can make

00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:10.319
Caption: changes to your application reload it

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:11.600
Caption: and instantly see your changes the

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.799
Caption: downside of that is that if you&#39;re

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.399
Caption: running a browser

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:17.839
Caption: you can&#39;t access the device um hardware

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:20.000
Caption: you have to run it on the actual device

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:21.440
Caption: to get that your performance isn&#39;t as

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.839
Caption: ever going to be as good as it is in

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.519
Caption: pure native because it&#39;s a web page

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.199
Caption: it also doesn&#39;t look and feel the same

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:30.479
Caption: as a web as a

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:32.319
Caption: natively rendered application

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.559
Caption: plus side of that your app will look

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.759
Caption: exactly the same on both platforms

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:37.919
Caption: that can be good if you get highly

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.559
Caption: stylized app if you want a native look

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.440
Caption: and feel

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:41.440
Caption: that&#39;s not so good

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.080
Caption: at adapter we use what we call parcel

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.839
Caption: solutions

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:51.519
Caption: these are a set of tools that we use to

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:51.519
Caption: do some of the heavy lifting up front

00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:56.239
Caption: swagger is a format that allows server

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:59.199
Caption: developers to define the shape of their

00:06:56.239 --> 00:07:01.598
Caption: api and how to communicate with that api

Caption: swagger code gen is an extension program

00:07:01.598 --> 00:07:03.839
Caption: for that which allows you to take that

Caption: definition

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:07.440
Caption: and render it into a variety of

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:09.279
Caption: languages

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.559
Caption: including java which is what we use it

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:12.399
Caption: for this gives us

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:14.959
Caption: our android model and how to communicate

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:17.440
Caption: with the api

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:18.239
Caption: we then take and we translate it with jt

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.239
Caption: objective c

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:22.399
Caption: this takes java code in splits our

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:25.440
Caption: objective c code at the other end

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:26.559
Caption: we have both our platforms we also use

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.519
Caption: squid db

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:30.639

00:07:33.598 --> 00:07:37.919
Caption: combination of these three

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.160
Caption: allows us to connect a web api download

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.919
Caption: the data perform business logic on it

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.440
Caption: and store it in a database and the

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:46.479
Caption: reverse process all across

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.080
Caption: platform in a nice clean way we still

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:49.839
Caption: have to build our ui and we still have

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:52.799
Caption: to do some of the business logic

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:55.440
Caption: and and the native site but it does a

00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:56.878
Caption: lot of the hard work for us

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.720
Caption: one of the most popular frameworks at

00:07:56.878 --> 00:08:00.160
Caption: the moment is react native it&#39;s a

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.119
Caption: javascript framework based on the

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.000
Caption: popular react

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:05.519
Caption: platform this was created by facebook

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.119
Caption: could previously been entirely web

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:08.239
Caption: focused and this was an attempt to catch

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:10.839
Caption: up with the native world

00:08:08.239 --> 00:08:12.399
Caption: powers apps such as skype instagram and

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:14.319
Caption: ubereats

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:15.759
Caption: react native differs from cordova style

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:18.239
Caption: apps that instead of rendering to a

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:22.000
Caption: webview it uses the native apis to

00:08:18.239 --> 00:08:24.959
Caption: render truly native front ends

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.239
Caption: let&#39;s take a look at how it does that

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:28.479
Caption: i&#39;m not sure how clearly this will be

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:30.239
Caption: from the back but it doesn&#39;t matter

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:32.479
Caption: react runs javascript in the background

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:34.799
Caption: thread to create a dom

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:37.200
Caption: differences in this dom are pushed up to

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:39.119
Caption: the react native bridge

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.320
Caption: this is all this all happens in c plus

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:42.559
Caption: plus so it&#39;s fast

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.479
Caption: and efficient at the other side of the

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:46.799
Caption: bridge this is passed on to the native

00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:50.639
Caption: layers so an objective c this is

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:54.080
Caption: this is in c and in java we use the

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.239
Caption: jdis to connect this allows us to

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.880
Caption: have native performance and native

00:08:56.239 --> 00:08:58.880
Caption: controls

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:05.599
Caption: other features uses the open source yoga

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:07.599
Caption: layout engine which implements a flavor

00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:09.039
Caption: of flexbox which again will be familiar

00:09:07.599 --> 00:09:12.239
Caption: to a lot of people who have done web

00:09:09.039 --> 00:09:14.799
Caption: development this is a lot simpler than

00:09:12.239 --> 00:09:16.640
Caption: either ios or android layouts a lot

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:18.719
Caption: easier to use

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.920
Caption: elements are defined in with jsx which

00:09:18.719 --> 00:09:22.719
Caption: allows us to

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:24.159
Caption: implement your layout inside your code

00:09:22.719 --> 00:09:26.319
Caption: the other major benefit is

00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:27.278
Caption: truly native controls you render an

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.679
Caption: alert

00:09:27.278 --> 00:09:31.838
Caption: on android that look like an android one

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:33.838
Caption: and on ios it will look like an ios one

00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:35.440
Caption: because it is

00:09:33.838 --> 00:09:37.119
Caption: now in order to demonstrate how much of

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.599
Caption: a time-saving cross-platform development

00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:41.278
Caption: can be

00:09:37.599 --> 00:09:43.838
Caption: i built an app about my cat feature and

00:09:41.278 --> 00:09:46.559
Caption: those are my cats

00:09:43.838 --> 00:09:47.440
Caption: so this demonstrates four parts of most

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:48.880
Caption: modern apps

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.039
Caption: there&#39;s user interaction in the shape of

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.919
Caption: a button it connects to

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:54.320
Caption: the net the internet and hits a web api

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:56.719
Caption: which

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.838
Caption: catches the service pack this returns a

00:09:56.719 --> 00:10:01.359
Caption: random

00:09:57.838 --> 00:10:01.838
Caption: json file which contains a url to a cat

00:10:01.359 --> 00:10:04.559
Caption: image

00:10:01.838 --> 00:10:06.559
Caption: we download that we download the image

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:08.719
Caption: and we display it

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:10.000
Caption: so first i wrote it in swift which looks

00:10:08.719 --> 00:10:12.559
Caption: a bit like this

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.838
Caption: 51 lines of code plus a storyboard for

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:17.039
Caption: the layout

00:10:13.838 --> 00:10:19.838
Caption: not an awful lot then on android

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:21.440
Caption: 107 lines of code plus the xml layout

00:10:19.838 --> 00:10:22.880
Caption: both these probably could have been

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.640
Caption: a bit shorter if you&#39;d use certain

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.239
Caption: libraries or whatever but it was a quick

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.640
Caption: example

00:10:26.239 --> 00:10:29.278
Caption: so running that looks like this android

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.398
Caption: and left

00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:35.599
Caption: ios on the right i then

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:38.398
Caption: built the same thing in react native

00:10:35.599 --> 00:10:39.278
Caption: that looks like this pretty much exactly

00:10:38.398 --> 00:10:40.719
Caption: the same

00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:42.719
Caption: the big difference is when we look at

00:10:40.719 --> 00:10:45.599
Caption: the code

00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:47.278
Caption: 52 lines of code this includes the style

00:10:45.599 --> 00:10:49.278
Caption: which is all seen in the bottom section

00:10:47.278 --> 00:10:52.719
Caption: the render section

00:10:49.278 --> 00:10:53.278
Caption: one code base no duplication a single

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:55.199
Caption: language

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:58.000
Caption: javascript you&#39;re not swapping between

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.320
Caption: storyboards or using xml or any of that

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.838
Caption: it&#39;s

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.760
Caption: everything is in javascript over a 50

00:11:01.838 --> 00:11:05.679
Caption: saving obviously that&#39;s not going to be

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.679
Caption: the case for every single application

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:09.760
Caption: but you&#39;re going to get some kind of

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:12.838
Caption: saving in that and you&#39;re not having to

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.040
Caption: go back and redo the same stuff over and

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:16.479
Caption: again

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:18.078
Caption: one of the new kids on the block is

00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:19.599
Caption: flutter and we had a really good talk

00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:21.119
Caption: about that earlier

00:11:19.599 --> 00:11:23.199
Caption: and this was developed by google using

00:11:21.119 --> 00:11:24.958
Caption: their own dart programming language

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.398
Caption: dart was designed through a simple fast

00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.599
Caption: predictable native language flutter is

00:11:28.398 --> 00:11:32.719
Caption: again slightly different

00:11:29.599 --> 00:11:36.159
Caption: and it renders its own components to

00:11:32.719 --> 00:11:37.759
Caption: a canvas this means it&#39;s very quick

00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:39.199
Caption: and it&#39;s because it&#39;s doing its own

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.880
Caption: drawing it doesn&#39;t need the bridge that

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.720
Caption: react native uses

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:46.640
Caption: however these widgets are its own design

00:11:44.719 --> 00:11:48.159
Caption: they make them look like the native ones

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.278
Caption: but they can there&#39;s a risk that can

00:11:48.159 --> 00:11:52.159
Caption: fall behind

00:11:49.278 --> 00:11:54.479
Caption: i saw an example just today whereas i uh

00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:56.319
Caption: ios 13 control has changed and it

00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:57.599
Caption: doesn&#39;t look right and flutter now

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.440
Caption: they&#39;re always going to be playing catch

00:11:57.599 --> 00:12:01.599
Caption: up so again it&#39;s

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.359
Caption: possibly good for a highly stylized app

00:12:01.599 --> 00:12:06.159
Caption: not necessarily great if you want pure

00:12:03.359 --> 00:12:08.880
Caption: native and you want cutting edge

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:10.159
Caption: uses reactive active programming as with

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.239
Caption: react native

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:13.599
Caption: it&#39;s got a quick entry it&#39;s very easy to

00:12:12.239 --> 00:12:17.518
Caption: use and very good

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:19.278
Caption: um startup it&#39;s a young community though

00:12:17.518 --> 00:12:21.039
Caption: and the support for it possibly isn&#39;t as

00:12:19.278 --> 00:12:22.719
Caption: good as some of the other platforms

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:24.159
Caption: and there&#39;s a lack of plug-in support

00:12:22.719 --> 00:12:25.759
Caption: for it at the moment

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:27.838
Caption: but google are really pushing this and

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.078
Caption: they&#39;re going to push it forward

00:12:27.838 --> 00:12:32.638
Caption: for the next their android replacement

00:12:30.078 --> 00:12:32.638
Caption: possibly

00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:37.440
Caption: last one progressive web apps there&#39;s

00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:40.958
Caption: claims that these are the best of the

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.958
Caption: web and best of native apps

00:12:41.599 --> 00:12:46.078
Caption: pwa is a website on steroids or that&#39;s

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:49.039
Caption: how it&#39;s been described

00:12:46.078 --> 00:12:50.799
Caption: works on every browser every device it&#39;s

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:54.479
Caption: always up to date and it&#39;s instantly

00:12:50.799 --> 00:12:56.880
Caption: available the same as a native app

00:12:54.479 --> 00:12:58.239
Caption: it&#39;s not a framework it&#39;s a set of

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.078
Caption: technologies that have been bundled

00:12:58.239 --> 00:13:02.638
Caption: together under this title

00:13:00.078 --> 00:13:04.479
Caption: the main main concern to be a pwa is

00:13:02.638 --> 00:13:06.398
Caption: that you pass google&#39;s lighthouse tests

00:13:04.479 --> 00:13:07.838
Caption: this sets out a group of standards such

00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:10.719
Caption: as being able to

00:13:07.838 --> 00:13:12.880
Caption: it has to be on https it has to be quick

00:13:10.719 --> 00:13:14.958
Caption: to download and respond

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.039
Caption: as to be able to respond if you don&#39;t

00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:20.479
Caption: have javascript enabled

00:13:17.039 --> 00:13:22.479
Caption: all of these concerns make it a pwa

00:13:20.479 --> 00:13:24.320
Caption: it also has to be downloadable which

00:13:22.479 --> 00:13:24.799
Caption: means it has a description that tells

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.799
Caption: the

00:13:24.799 --> 00:13:29.919
Caption: browser how to download it package it

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:31.838
Caption: and put it onto your device

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:35.838
Caption: this means they bypass the app store you

00:13:31.838 --> 00:13:35.838
Caption: simply go to the website and download it

00:13:38.398 --> 00:13:41.518
Caption: pwas are bound by what you can do on the

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.440
Caption: web

00:13:41.518 --> 00:13:45.838
Caption: so you can use push notification you can

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.599
Caption: use bluetooth you can access gps

00:13:45.838 --> 00:13:49.518
Caption: you can&#39;t access certain other features

00:13:47.599 --> 00:13:52.479
Caption: such as contacts nfc and

00:13:49.518 --> 00:13:54.239
Caption: sms but this is changing all the time

00:13:52.479 --> 00:13:57.599
Caption: previously you couldn&#39;t do payments but

00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:57.599
Caption: that&#39;s coming very soon

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.119
Caption: again low data requirements and one of

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.320
Caption: the other things lacking at the moment

00:14:01.119 --> 00:14:04.320
Caption: is cross-platform

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.838
Caption: login so you can&#39;t use things such as

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.838
Caption: twitter or facebook logins

00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:13.518
Caption: so back to my original questions what is

00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:15.278
Caption: cross-platform development

00:14:13.518 --> 00:14:17.039
Caption: cross-platform development is a set of

00:14:15.278 --> 00:14:18.559
Caption: tools or frameworks which reduce the

00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:20.719
Caption: overhead of writing from multiple

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:22.880
Caption: platforms

00:14:20.719 --> 00:14:25.518
Caption: is it useful well it can be if it

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:28.078
Caption: delivers what you&#39;re looking for

00:14:25.518 --> 00:14:29.518
Caption: and provides a saving if you don&#39;t get

00:14:28.078 --> 00:14:30.000
Caption: the performance you don&#39;t get what

00:14:29.518 --> 00:14:32.239
Caption: you&#39;re looking

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.119
Caption: for it but then it&#39;s probably not worth

00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:35.599
Caption: it but

00:14:33.119 --> 00:14:37.359
Caption: for an awful lot of standard type apps

00:14:35.599 --> 00:14:37.919
Caption: it probably is a good thing to do if

00:14:37.359 --> 00:14:41.518
Caption: you&#39;re going to

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:42.320
Caption: deploy to both platforms which solution

00:14:41.518 --> 00:14:44.719
Caption: is for me

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.078
Caption: well we&#39;ve gone through a bunch of them

00:14:44.719 --> 00:14:47.198
Caption: if you want cutting edge and you want

00:14:46.078 --> 00:14:49.359
Caption: the best performance

00:14:47.198 --> 00:14:50.479
Caption: pure native for still still a great

00:14:49.359 --> 00:14:52.398
Caption: choice

00:14:50.479 --> 00:14:54.398
Caption: specifically if you&#39;re trying to use

00:14:52.398 --> 00:14:57.440
Caption: newer technologies such as vr

00:14:54.398 --> 00:14:58.958
Caption: wearables the support just isn&#39;t quite

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.159
Caption: there for some of the other platforms

00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.919
Caption: and they&#39;re always going to be a step

00:15:00.159 --> 00:15:03.679
Caption: behind

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:05.440
Caption: parcel solutions i talked about if

00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:06.880
Caption: you&#39;re already building native apps then

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.239
Caption: these can help do some of the heavy

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.440
Caption: lifting for you and leave you to

00:15:08.239 --> 00:15:13.359
Caption: concentrate on the front end

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.799
Caption: if you&#39;ve got a web-based team already

00:15:13.359 --> 00:15:15.119
Caption: then one of the web-based frameworks

00:15:14.799 --> 00:15:18.398
Caption: such

00:15:15.119 --> 00:15:20.479
Caption: as flutter sorry react native or cordova

00:15:18.398 --> 00:15:21.760
Caption: might be your answer

00:15:20.479 --> 00:15:23.440
Caption: if you want a leading edge and you&#39;re

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.479
Caption: looking to the future then flutter might

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.000
Caption: be the choice

00:15:24.479 --> 00:15:29.958
Caption: but you run those risks there are others

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.440
Caption: xamarin which is great if you&#39;ve got a

00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.278
Caption: c-sharp.net team

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.398
Caption: it&#39;s got great performance as well

00:15:33.278 --> 00:15:37.838
Caption: because it compiles down to native code

00:15:36.398 --> 00:15:39.838
Caption: if you want a quick and easy solution

00:15:37.838 --> 00:15:41.198
Caption: you&#39;ve already got a website and pwas

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:42.479
Caption: might be your answer but that&#39;s never

00:15:41.198 --> 00:15:43.758
Caption: going to be a native it&#39;s an

00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:46.320
Caption: app it&#39;s never going to look like a

00:15:43.758 --> 00:15:46.319
Caption: native app

00:15:48.398 --> 00:15:52.000
Caption: so the answer is really in figuring out

00:15:50.398 --> 00:15:52.799
Caption: what&#39;s important to you and matching

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.880
Caption: with this

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:55.838
Caption: solution that fits your specific use

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.198
Caption: case

00:15:55.838 --> 00:15:59.198
Caption: that&#39;s not to say that the

00:15:57.198 --> 00:15:59.919
Caption: cross-platform development is always the

00:15:59.198 --> 00:16:02.479
Caption: answer

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:03.758
Caption: and give an example of where it can be

00:16:02.479 --> 00:16:05.919
Caption: difficult we had a

00:16:03.758 --> 00:16:07.440
Caption: project where we had to render two maps

00:16:05.919 --> 00:16:10.159
Caption: on a single screen

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.599
Caption: was working perfectly in ios on android

00:16:10.159 --> 00:16:13.359
Caption: the second screen wasn&#39;t rendering

00:16:11.599 --> 00:16:15.359
Caption: correctly either wouldn&#39;t appear or the

00:16:13.359 --> 00:16:16.958
Caption: map points wouldn&#39;t appear on it

00:16:15.359 --> 00:16:18.559
Caption: we ended up having to delve down to the

00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:21.679
Caption: native code

00:16:18.559 --> 00:16:25.119
Caption: tweak that submit a pro request to

00:16:21.679 --> 00:16:28.479
Caption: react native um

00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:30.320
Caption: source code um if you don&#39;t have

00:16:28.479 --> 00:16:32.159
Caption: those skills you wouldn&#39;t be able to do

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.838
Caption: that if you&#39;re relying on as a web

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:36.000
Caption: developer as your solution to get

00:16:33.838 --> 00:16:38.958
Caption: on a native platform then you can hit

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.958
Caption: those kind of issues

00:16:41.278 --> 00:16:45.119
Caption: as i mentioned i won&#39;t be taking any

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.119
Caption: questions however um

00:16:45.119 --> 00:16:48.719
Caption: i will be putting this up as a blog post

00:16:47.119 --> 00:16:50.159
Caption: shortly on our website and

00:16:48.719 --> 00:16:52.799
Caption: as i say i&#39;ll be here for the rest of

00:16:50.159 --> 00:16:54.000
Caption: the day and you can push myself or any

00:16:52.799 --> 00:17:00.000
Caption: of my colleagues

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Caption: thank you
