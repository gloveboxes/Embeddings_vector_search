WEBVTT

00:00:00.718 --> 00:00:05.940
Caption: good morning everyone thanks so much for

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:08.279
Caption: coming it&#39;s my absolute pleasure to

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.360
Caption: introduce Macklin uh Hartley to you

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:15.178
Caption: today he is a full stack engineer who&#39;s

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:18.239
Caption: been in the industry for nearly 10 years

00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:21.118
Caption: so a fair bit of experience there and he

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:24.358
Caption: speaks about a range of topics including

00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:27.420
Caption: accessibility queuing Theory continuous

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:29.819
Caption: delivery and feature toggling and this

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.679
Caption: is his third speaking engagement at DDD

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:35.279
Caption: and he&#39;s going to be talking to you

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.770
Caption: about how fast is your website really so

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:42.238
Caption: please Round of Applause for Macklin

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.340
Caption: [Applause]

00:00:42.238 --> 00:00:45.959
Caption: thank you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.180
Caption: is this working

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:49.799
Caption: yep all right so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.659
Caption: how fast is your website really that&#39;s

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:55.078
Caption: the question I&#39;m going to ask today how

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:57.659
Caption: many people build fast websites

00:00:55.078 --> 00:00:58.919
Caption: so you all build slow websites that&#39;s

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.379
Caption: probably why you&#39;re here I guess right

00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:03.238
Caption: cool

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.519
Caption: um how do you know if your website&#39;s

00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:06.720
Caption: fast though I kind of was built built

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:08.039
Caption: this slide under the assumption that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.119
Caption: everyone will put their hands up but

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.279
Caption: that&#39;s okay

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.900
Caption: um how do we even know that&#39;s probably

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.919
Caption: the question that we need to ask at the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.200
Caption: moment

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:18.839
Caption: so spoiler alert this is how you know

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:21.298
Caption: this is this is the answer you need to

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:22.978
Caption: have user-centric performance metrics

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.200
Caption: you need to capture those metrics from

00:01:22.978 --> 00:01:27.000
Caption: real devices and you need to have

00:01:25.199 --> 00:01:29.099
Caption: continuous observability over those

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.540
Caption: metrics so that&#39;s that&#39;s the whole talk

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:32.279
Caption: right

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.479
Caption: um no that&#39;s that&#39;s the that&#39;s the end

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:34.739
Caption: of the talk I&#39;m going to get to that

00:01:33.478 --> 00:01:37.199
Caption: point but we&#39;ve got to figure out how to

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:39.360
Caption: get there right

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:41.158
Caption: um just before I continue on one thing

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.439
Caption: that this talk is not going to be is how

00:01:41.158 --> 00:01:46.139
Caption: to actually tune for better performance

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.880
Caption: how to do web Performance Tuning that&#39;s

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:50.099
Caption: probably a whole other talk in itself

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:52.019
Caption: and actually there&#39;s tons of tips like

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.059
Caption: Google will give you heaps of tips on

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:55.919
Caption: how to do that so we&#39;ll separate that

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:57.118
Caption: out of this talk we&#39;re just going to

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:57.898
Caption: figure out how to actually measure it

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.500
Caption: first

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.840
Caption: uh and then we&#39;ll go from there

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.579
Caption: so let&#39;s start by forgetting everything

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:08.160
Caption: we actually know about web performance

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.839
Caption: monitoring we&#39;ll start from scratch I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.940
Caption: like the idea of starting somewhere

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:14.098
Caption: really naive and then kind of building

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.139
Caption: up building up from there so what we&#39;re

00:02:14.098 --> 00:02:17.940
Caption: going to do is do the simplest thing

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:21.119
Caption: that I can probably think of which is

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.619
Caption: just on on that page load event this is

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.539
Caption: an event that&#39;s available to you in the

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:26.458
Caption: browser we&#39;re just going to track our

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.679
Caption: performance there so this would be code

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:31.919
Caption: that you can actually run and we can see

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:34.859
Caption: our page took 729 milliseconds to load

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:36.598
Caption: so that&#39;s nice except that kind of falls

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.580
Caption: apart because the moment we look in the

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:40.619
Caption: performance inspector which is a tool

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.018
Caption: that&#39;s available inside Chrome you can

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:44.339
Caption: see the the red L there that&#39;s your page

00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:45.958
Caption: load event and you can actually see that

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.339
Caption: stuff&#39;s happening on either side of that

00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.500
Caption: event and actually most of it&#39;s

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:51.779
Caption: happening on the wrong side so that&#39;s

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.279
Caption: not telling us anything useful basically

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.500
Caption: more of the stuff is happening after

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:58.819
Caption: that event

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.819
Caption: so we&#39;ve got to try and fix that

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:04.259
Caption: one thing we could do is we could use

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:05.580
Caption: the new navigation timing API so it&#39;s a

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.639
Caption: bit more modern than just sort of

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.619
Caption: running a page load event

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.360
Caption: that is okay but really that&#39;s just

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.979
Caption: giving us a whole lot of numbers that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.598
Caption: are about as meaningless as the page

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:18.958
Caption: load event now it&#39;s not telling us

00:03:15.598 --> 00:03:21.658
Caption: anything useful when I get Dom content

00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:23.639
Caption: loaded event end what does that mean

00:03:21.658 --> 00:03:26.238
Caption: what does that mean for the user what

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.238
Caption: does that look like

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:32.399
Caption: so a bunch of smart big brain people

00:03:29.458 --> 00:03:33.958
Caption: have gotten together and actually uh

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:36.779
Caption: all realize that we all have the same

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:39.000
Caption: problem and they put together the w3c

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:40.440
Caption: web performance working group

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.238
Caption: and this group

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.400
Caption: came together and came up with a the

00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:46.619
Caption: Kinder term called user-centric

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:47.699
Caption: performance or user-centric performance

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:49.378
Caption: metrics

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.940
Caption: so what are those

00:03:49.378 --> 00:03:52.279
Caption: they&#39;re centered around a couple of

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.500
Caption: different things

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:57.958
Caption: you&#39;ve got perceived load speed it&#39;s as

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.878
Caption: perceived as in as best as we can

00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.259
Caption: represent the load speed perceived by

00:03:59.878 --> 00:04:04.018
Caption: the user

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:07.080
Caption: load responsiveness which is just how

00:04:04.018 --> 00:04:09.119
Caption: fast that that process goes for

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.000
Caption: runtime responsiveness which is after

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:13.438
Caption: it&#39;s loaded how fast is your website and

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.539
Caption: then two other things visual stability

00:04:13.438 --> 00:04:18.660
Caption: and smoothness which are less about

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:21.839
Caption: performance but still really important

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.959
Caption: and out of that who&#39;s seen these before

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:27.660
Caption: these metrics yeah web vitals a number

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:29.000
Caption: of metrics with abbreviations that are

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.619
Caption: sometimes hard to remember

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.019
Caption: that are the key metrics for measuring

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:35.459
Caption: web performance really handy

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:37.198
Caption: I&#39;m going to go through all of these

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:38.699
Caption: really quickly I know a lot of you

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.559
Caption: people put your hands up saying that

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.059
Caption: they&#39;ve seen these before so I won&#39;t

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:43.440
Caption: spend too long on them but we&#39;re going

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:45.779
Caption: to go through what each one of these

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.639
Caption: means just quickly so time to First Bite

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.019
Caption: is the time between when the browser

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.240
Caption: requests the page and when it receives

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:52.859
Caption: the first byte of information back and

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:56.339
Caption: it&#39;s kind of just all of the stuff

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:57.839
Caption: that&#39;s happening before your page loads

00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:00.299
Caption: um there&#39;s actually quite a lot of it

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:03.000
Caption: usually a lot of this happens very very

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:04.918
Caption: quickly so it&#39;s almost imperceptible but

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.899
Caption: a number of things can actually affect

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.940
Caption: how long this process takes

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:10.940
Caption: so it&#39;s really important to measure that

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:15.899
Caption: Google

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.179
Caption: who I guess are big and heavily involved

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:20.699
Caption: in the w3c working web performance

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:23.039
Caption: working group suggest that time to First

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.720
Caption: Bite should be under 800 milliseconds

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.059
Caption: that&#39;s a good score but anything over

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.100
Caption: 1.8 seconds is poor and needs

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:31.859
Caption: Improvement

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.899
Caption: next up we have first content for paint

00:05:31.859 --> 00:05:36.239
Caption: this is the time from when the page

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:37.859
Caption: starts loading to any any part of the

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:40.079
Caption: page is rendered on the screen so this

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:41.879
Caption: is going from a white box in your

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:44.519
Caption: browser to the first time anything

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.380
Caption: appears on the screen

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:49.500
Caption: it looks a bit like this

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.059
Caption: so we can see we captured FCP when that

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.720
Caption: first part of the result comes up on the

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:52.919
Caption: top

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.059
Caption: um Google&#39;s really convenient for

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.399
Caption: testing this stuff because they stream

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:57.479
Caption: these results back to you so you slow it

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:58.619
Caption: down slightly and you can actually

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.600
Caption: capture this

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:03.559
Caption: now we can see at the top there fcp&#39;s

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.559
Caption: 0.5 seconds

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.519
Caption: SCP should be anywhere between uh should

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.160
Caption: be below 1.8 seconds if you can help it

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:13.500
Caption: anything above three seconds is too long

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.600
Caption: and it needs Improvement

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.679
Caption: next up you have LCP or largest content

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.959
Caption: for paint

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:21.359
Caption: this is tracking how many seconds it

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:24.559
Caption: takes for the largest item or the

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:27.359
Caption: largest data most most data intensive

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:29.660
Caption: element above the fault element takes to

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:29.659
Caption: load

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.799
Caption: so it looks like this we can actually

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:38.039
Caption: see it shifts as this page loads and

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:40.379
Caption: we&#39;re looking at the the largest uh

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:42.360
Caption: we&#39;re we&#39;re stretching oops we&#39;re

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.239
Caption: tracking the largest element on the page

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:47.638
Caption: at a given time

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:49.579
Caption: pick that up

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.839
Caption: so you can see

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:53.579
Caption: LCP shifts from from sort of the top of

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:56.339
Caption: the bottom of the page is actually the

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:58.019
Caption: FCP at the very beginning but then as

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:00.179
Caption: the the largest as we kind of uncover

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:01.440
Caption: the largest element as we go that FCP

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:04.759
Caption: score changes and at the end we

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.759
Caption: calculate it at 1.6 seconds

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:08.880
Caption: largest content for paint should be

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:12.559
Caption: under 2.5 seconds if you can help it and

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.559
Caption: anything over four seconds is too long

00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:18.299
Caption: then you have some other metrics as well

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:20.220
Caption: less associated with load times but

00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:22.259
Caption: still really important this one&#39;s called

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.880
Caption: first input delay it&#39;s the time for the

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:25.019
Caption: first interaction on the page and the

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.660
Caption: first time your user clicks anything

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:29.819
Caption: Google targeted the first time the user

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.380
Caption: clicks anything because quite often

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:33.479
Caption: while your page is loading it&#39;s quite a

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.179
Caption: data intensive CPU intensive exercise

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:38.220
Caption: and if your user clicks anything while

00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:40.259
Caption: that&#39;s happening you are likely to see

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.739
Caption: some sort of delay or incur some sort of

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:46.440
Caption: sort of uh less than ideal experience so

00:07:43.739 --> 00:07:48.119
Caption: they focused on that first input

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.279
Caption: it looks a little bit like this um

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:52.259
Caption: usually it&#39;s quite imperceptible that

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:54.839
Caption: the target scores are very low so this

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:55.979
Caption: is a bit more of a contrived example but

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:57.598
Caption: you can click that button and then

00:07:55.979 --> 00:08:00.019
Caption: there&#39;s an input delay there and we

00:07:57.598 --> 00:08:00.019
Caption: track that

00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:05.519
Caption: like I was saying quite quite low Target

00:08:03.059 --> 00:08:07.819
Caption: scores there usually imperceptible like

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:10.440
Caption: 100 milliseconds is quite imperceptible

00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:13.619
Caption: a good score is 100 milliseconds

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.419
Caption: anything over 300 is too long

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:16.919
Caption: next up this is a fairly new metric

00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:18.479
Caption: called interaction to next paint and the

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:20.759
Caption: way to think about this one is its first

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:22.559
Caption: input delay calculated slightly

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:24.479
Caption: differently but over the course of the

00:08:22.559 --> 00:08:26.339
Caption: entire interaction with the page so not

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:27.779
Caption: just the first interaction but every

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:30.959
Caption: interaction on the page every button you

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:33.440
Caption: click every Carousel you scroll and

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:33.440
Caption: stuff like that

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:37.080
Caption: interactions the next plane should be

00:08:35.338 --> 00:08:37.940
Caption: under 200 milliseconds if you can help

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.398
Caption: it

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:43.739
Caption: anything of a every anything over half a

00:08:41.398 --> 00:08:45.479
Caption: second is too long

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:47.458
Caption: now there&#39;s a slide missing there but

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:50.278
Caption: that&#39;s all right cumulative layout shift

00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:51.599
Caption: is the last one uh this one is a little

00:08:50.278 --> 00:08:52.679
Caption: bit a little bit different but I think

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:54.179
Caption: it&#39;s still a really important metric

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:57.419
Caption: it&#39;s not so much about web performance

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:59.278
Caption: as as much as as much it is about sort

00:08:57.419 --> 00:09:02.219
Caption: of visual stability

00:08:59.278 --> 00:09:04.799
Caption: um the way we can perceive

00:09:02.219 --> 00:09:05.398
Caption: cumulative layout shift this is why I

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:07.200
Caption: think it&#39;s really important because

00:09:05.398 --> 00:09:10.159
Caption: these are really annoying and they suck

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.380
Caption: and no user likes this when this happens

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:14.518
Caption: this is maybe a less disastrous example

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.859
Caption: but

00:09:14.518 --> 00:09:17.639
Caption: no missing a slide there too cool

00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:19.380
Caption: um

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.838
Caption: there was a I think there was a famous

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:25.080
Caption: example where there was a layout shift

00:09:21.838 --> 00:09:26.820
Caption: on a on a page with a nuclear missile

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.500
Caption: alert test system and they clicked the

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.778
Caption: wrong one that&#39;s that&#39;s the picture I

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.940
Caption: had but it&#39;s gone so

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:34.859
Caption: this is a score between zero and one so

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.119
Caption: sort of a calculated score I think of it

00:09:34.859 --> 00:09:37.500
Caption: more of like a percentage I don&#39;t know

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:40.260
Caption: if that&#39;s actually what it&#39;s meant to

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:45.239
Caption: represent but anything below 0.1 or 10

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:47.220
Caption: is good uh anything over 25 or 0.25

00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:48.539
Caption: probably needs some work it&#39;s probably

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:50.278
Caption: got too many of those shifting

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:53.059
Caption: components that are getting in the way

00:09:50.278 --> 00:09:53.059
Caption: annoying your users

00:09:53.338 --> 00:09:58.619
Caption: so a number of these metrics not all of

00:09:56.159 --> 00:09:59.879
Caption: them make up what Google called The Core

00:09:58.619 --> 00:10:02.278
Caption: web vitals

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.898
Caption: you can see here largest contentful

00:10:02.278 --> 00:10:06.659
Caption: paint and first input delay and

00:10:03.898 --> 00:10:09.778
Caption: cumulative layout shift they make up

00:10:06.659 --> 00:10:12.479
Caption: actually what Google uses to decide

00:10:09.778 --> 00:10:16.440
Caption: whether where your search engine ranking

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:18.898
Caption: is if you have uh if you&#39;re somewhere on

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.059
Caption: a search engine page typically you can

00:10:18.898 --> 00:10:23.880
Caption: move up that search engine page and

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:26.278
Caption: result if you have a faster website so

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:29.039
Caption: there&#39;s actually material benefit here a

00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:30.778
Caption: commercial benefit in that if you

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:33.059
Caption: improve the performance of your site you

00:10:30.778 --> 00:10:35.159
Caption: actually get get improved performance

00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:36.958
Caption: sort of in your externalities for

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:38.639
Caption: example

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:41.518
Caption: um I want to talk about largest tent for

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.380
Caption: pain why did they choose that one

00:10:41.518 --> 00:10:45.898
Caption: it&#39;s because these metrics aren&#39;t they

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.099
Caption: don&#39;t have atomicity so you might have

00:10:45.898 --> 00:10:48.778
Caption: noticed when we went through our

00:10:47.099 --> 00:10:50.819
Caption: examples before

00:10:48.778 --> 00:10:52.739
Caption: um time to first by time to first by the

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.778
Caption: way it&#39;s calculated usually means um

00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:56.578
Caption: you&#39;ll get a score that is below first

00:10:54.778 --> 00:10:57.958
Caption: content for pain and a score that is

00:10:56.578 --> 00:10:59.940
Caption: below your largest contentful pain

00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.260
Caption: sometimes the first contentful and

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.898
Caption: largest contentful paint will be the

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.820
Caption: same that&#39;s probably a good thing

00:11:02.898 --> 00:11:08.119
Caption: but what this means is tracking all of

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:10.320
Caption: these three together

00:11:08.119 --> 00:11:12.000
Caption: we can actually sort of look at the

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.100
Caption: differences between them and identify

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.679
Caption: which one is having the most impact on

00:11:14.099 --> 00:11:19.199
Caption: your web performance so for example if

00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:20.640
Caption: you have a high very high number for

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.518
Caption: time to First buy that&#39;s usually an

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.200
Caption: indicator that your user is very far

00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:27.179
Caption: away from where your web page is being

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.859
Caption: served from you can improve that by

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:31.679
Caption: bringing them closer together

00:11:28.859 --> 00:11:33.539
Caption: now whereas if for example if your time

00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:35.219
Caption: to First byte is really good

00:11:33.539 --> 00:11:37.139
Caption: um but you&#39;ve got a kind of a larger Gap

00:11:35.219 --> 00:11:38.939
Caption: to First contentful paint sort of in

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.859
Caption: this case here and then a very large gap

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.619
Caption: to largest condent for paint

00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:45.838
Caption: um we&#39;re able to transfer the JavaScript

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:47.760
Caption: and the HTML onto the page very very

00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:49.619
Caption: quickly but it takes a long time to

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.179
Caption: process that past the JavaScript and

00:11:49.619 --> 00:11:54.320
Caption: render it so that&#39;s where you&#39;d probably

00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:54.320
Caption: want to set your focus

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.660
Caption: and setting a focus on stuff like this

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.760
Caption: is really good like we have case studies

00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:04.518
Caption: that actually prove that there is

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.380
Caption: commercial benefit to doing this

00:12:04.518 --> 00:12:08.458
Caption: vodafone&#39;s a really good example

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.859
Caption: vodafone&#39;s huge so eight percent of

00:12:08.458 --> 00:12:12.958
Caption: sales is an astronomically High number

00:12:10.859 --> 00:12:15.000
Caption: but eight percent more sales when they

00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:17.659
Caption: increase their performance on largest

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.659
Caption: contentful pain

00:12:18.778 --> 00:12:22.559
Caption: so I think we know how to get

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.660
Caption: user-centric performance metrics now we

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:26.278
Caption: know what they are at least so we can

00:12:24.659 --> 00:12:27.898
Caption: tick that box

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:30.898
Caption: let&#39;s figure out now how to actually

00:12:27.898 --> 00:12:32.338
Caption: capture these metrics

00:12:30.898 --> 00:12:34.619
Caption: so there&#39;s a couple of different ways

00:12:32.338 --> 00:12:37.200
Caption: that we can capture them you&#39;ve got ad

00:12:34.619 --> 00:12:39.059
Caption: hoc testing synthetic monitoring and

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.820
Caption: then real user monitoring so I&#39;m going

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:44.338
Caption: to go into each one of those

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.138
Caption: ad hoc testing who&#39;s used Lighthouse for

00:12:44.338 --> 00:12:48.898
Caption: Google Chrome before

00:12:46.138 --> 00:12:51.380
Caption: nice this this side of the room

00:12:48.898 --> 00:12:54.479
Caption: I&#39;ll Focus my attention this way then

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:56.720
Caption: so Lighthouse for Google Chrome is a

00:12:54.479 --> 00:12:59.518
Caption: tool built-in built into Google Chrome

00:12:56.719 --> 00:13:01.739
Caption: that allows you to test any web page

00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:04.200
Caption: probably more likely your own the one

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:06.778
Caption: that you manage and it will give you

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.458
Caption: back those those web vital scores you

00:13:06.778 --> 00:13:10.859
Caption: can see them it&#39;s probably kind of small

00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:12.059
Caption: but those numbers in the bottom right

00:13:10.859 --> 00:13:14.760
Caption: corner

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:16.380
Caption: it&#39;s tracked first contentful paint

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.600
Caption: largest kind of content will paint all

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:21.239
Caption: of those other metrics

00:13:18.599 --> 00:13:22.559
Caption: um this is really handy it&#39;s obviously a

00:13:21.239 --> 00:13:24.599
Caption: free tool

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:26.219
Caption: um that you obviously a free tool that

00:13:24.599 --> 00:13:27.958
Caption: you can like everyone already has so

00:13:26.219 --> 00:13:30.119
Caption: really good to start using that

00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:32.820
Caption: um but perhaps a better example is this

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:33.719
Caption: tool here also provided by Google this

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.518
Caption: will run

00:13:33.719 --> 00:13:41.159
Caption: uh lighthouse on your behalf on a device

00:13:37.518 --> 00:13:43.200
Caption: that is not a desktop computer so this

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:45.000
Caption: makes a huge difference because the

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.880
Caption: performance profile of the mobile device

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.219
Caption: which is what this will run on

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.778
Caption: it makes a significant difference to the

00:13:50.219 --> 00:13:54.179
Caption: score and it&#39;s actually probably more

00:13:51.778 --> 00:13:55.979
Caption: realistic and representative of real

00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:57.898
Caption: world traffic most of your users are

00:13:55.979 --> 00:13:59.479
Caption: going to come from mobile devices the

00:13:57.898 --> 00:14:01.859
Caption: other interesting thing about this is

00:13:59.479 --> 00:14:03.719
Caption: this will run in a data center in the

00:14:01.859 --> 00:14:06.539
Caption: United States so if the majority of your

00:14:03.719 --> 00:14:07.979
Caption: customers are there and not here this is

00:14:06.539 --> 00:14:10.159
Caption: going to be more representative of that

00:14:07.979 --> 00:14:10.159
Caption: too

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:15.359
Caption: so this ad hoc testing this is really

00:14:12.778 --> 00:14:17.518
Caption: great it&#39;s free anyone can do this and I

00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:19.679
Caption: suggest and recommend that people do

00:14:17.518 --> 00:14:21.179
Caption: this when you&#39;ve got if you&#39;ve got a

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:22.559
Caption: website you should be kind of testing

00:14:21.179 --> 00:14:24.778
Caption: the performance and tracking all of this

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:26.638
Caption: stuff there&#39;s no setup required everyone

00:14:24.778 --> 00:14:30.059
Caption: has Google Chrome even if you don&#39;t use

00:14:26.638 --> 00:14:32.338
Caption: it you&#39;ve probably got it uh but these

00:14:30.059 --> 00:14:34.078
Caption: are only good for once off manual tests

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:36.599
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s clicking around testing stuff

00:14:34.078 --> 00:14:39.599
Caption: we don&#39;t have any automation here and

00:14:36.599 --> 00:14:42.778
Caption: they&#39;re also even though uh the the web

00:14:39.599 --> 00:14:46.078
Caption: performance uh the the web.dev measure

00:14:42.778 --> 00:14:47.698
Caption: that Tool uh runs in a US data center on

00:14:46.078 --> 00:14:49.859
Caption: a mobile device they still don&#39;t really

00:14:47.698 --> 00:14:52.619
Caption: represent real world traffic

00:14:49.859 --> 00:14:54.719
Caption: I&#39;ll get back to that in a minute

00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:56.278
Caption: one of our other options is synthetic

00:14:54.719 --> 00:14:58.619
Caption: monitoring so this is an example of one

00:14:56.278 --> 00:15:00.198
Caption: tool um these are really cool people to

00:14:58.619 --> 00:15:02.099
Caption: build this they&#39;re based in Australia

00:15:00.198 --> 00:15:04.619
Caption: caliber and what we&#39;re actually looking

00:15:02.099 --> 00:15:07.319
Caption: at here is a pull request a comment on a

00:15:04.619 --> 00:15:09.359
Caption: pull request so the way this tool is set

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:13.138
Caption: up is every time you create a pull

00:15:09.359 --> 00:15:15.559
Caption: request you can set it up to uh

00:15:13.138 --> 00:15:18.778
Caption: on a deployed version of of this change

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:20.880
Caption: uh run run a web web vitals test I think

00:15:18.778 --> 00:15:22.979
Caption: it runs it just runs Lighthouse but on

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.419
Caption: your behalf it will run on multiple

00:15:22.979 --> 00:15:27.539
Caption: different devices so we&#39;ll run on

00:15:24.419 --> 00:15:29.638
Caption: desktops but multiple different Android

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:31.559
Caption: and iOS devices for you as well we&#39;ll

00:15:29.638 --> 00:15:33.059
Caption: check that and it can you can choose all

00:15:31.559 --> 00:15:34.500
Caption: the locations and stuff like that that

00:15:33.059 --> 00:15:36.299
Caption: you run on so it&#39;s a bit more

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.778
Caption: representative of your real world

00:15:36.299 --> 00:15:38.778
Caption: traffic again

00:15:39.179 --> 00:15:41.698
Caption: so this is this is probably a better

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:43.500
Caption: tool

00:15:41.698 --> 00:15:45.719
Caption: um if you want to sort of take the next

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.338
Caption: step you&#39;ve got your continuous

00:15:45.719 --> 00:15:49.078
Caption: integration continuous delivery

00:15:47.338 --> 00:15:50.458
Caption: automation through those pull request

00:15:49.078 --> 00:15:52.979
Caption: checks

00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:54.599
Caption: so that allows you if you&#39;re doing your

00:15:52.979 --> 00:15:55.979
Caption: regular pull request to monitor change

00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:57.778
Caption: over time

00:15:55.979 --> 00:16:00.599
Caption: unfortunately this Tool&#39;s not free you&#39;d

00:15:57.778 --> 00:16:02.458
Caption: have to pay a little bit to use it and

00:16:00.599 --> 00:16:04.500
Caption: it&#39;s still not representative of real

00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:05.638
Caption: world traffic so we&#39;ve got more devices

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.778
Caption: now

00:16:05.638 --> 00:16:08.278
Caption: um but at the end of the day those

00:16:06.778 --> 00:16:10.559
Caption: devices are still running in data

00:16:08.278 --> 00:16:12.179
Caption: centers and we&#39;re kind of

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:13.500
Caption: assuming that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to behave

00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:17.239
Caption: on the real world but it&#39;s still not the

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.239
Caption: real world like I think we can do better

00:16:18.838 --> 00:16:24.119
Caption: why do I think this is important so

00:16:21.599 --> 00:16:25.799
Caption: if we look at browser engines we might

00:16:24.119 --> 00:16:27.778
Caption: be mistaken into thinking that there&#39;s

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:30.659
Caption: not a whole lot of diversity there so

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:33.719
Caption: you&#39;ve got a webkit-based devices this

00:16:30.659 --> 00:16:36.000
Caption: is uh traffic from a website that I I

00:16:33.719 --> 00:16:38.398
Caption: currently kind of maintain so don&#39;t know

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.578
Caption: this is 100 accurate to like Global

00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:43.198
Caption: statistics but if we look at browser

00:16:41.578 --> 00:16:46.198
Caption: engines you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got web kits

00:16:43.198 --> 00:16:49.619
Caption: so every single iOS device as well as

00:16:46.198 --> 00:16:52.380
Caption: some Mac OS desktop devices will be

00:16:49.619 --> 00:16:54.479
Caption: running webkit I say every single iOS

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.759
Caption: device if you&#39;ve got Google Chrome on

00:16:54.479 --> 00:16:59.039
Caption: your iPhone it&#39;s actually webkit it&#39;s

00:16:56.758 --> 00:17:01.919
Caption: not Google Chrome and then the rest of

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:03.898
Caption: it is Blink so same same browser engine

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:05.938
Caption: as Google Chrome if you&#39;re running

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:09.178
Caption: Microsoft Edge you&#39;ve got that so not a

00:17:05.938 --> 00:17:11.279
Caption: whole lot of diversity there

00:17:09.178 --> 00:17:13.198
Caption: same with form factor we&#39;re down to sort

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.838
Caption: of a two-speed World you&#39;ve got desktop

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:18.119
Caption: devices and mobile devices you&#39;ve got a

00:17:15.838 --> 00:17:20.958
Caption: small sliver there for TVs or something

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.958
Caption: tablets right

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:24.958
Caption: but I think this is probably a naive way

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.059
Caption: to look at it so you might look at these

00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:30.000
Caption: and go I really only need to test on an

00:17:27.058 --> 00:17:32.520
Caption: iPhone and maybe one Android device and

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.880
Caption: a Windows desktop maybe that should be

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:39.119
Caption: enough I don&#39;t think that&#39;s good enough

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:41.880
Caption: let&#39;s have a look at this is a a graph

00:17:39.119 --> 00:17:45.178
Caption: showing the the single core scores of

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:47.039
Caption: devices a wide range of devices mobile

00:17:45.178 --> 00:17:50.760
Caption: devices

00:17:47.038 --> 00:17:52.500
Caption: um it goes up to 2020 so I think there&#39;s

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.719
Caption: been some shifts as well but the really

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.298
Caption: interesting thing this is telling us is

00:17:54.719 --> 00:17:59.699
Caption: there&#39;s a huge like massive difference

00:17:57.298 --> 00:18:01.979
Caption: in performance between top-end devices

00:17:59.699 --> 00:18:04.380
Caption: and low end devices and the problem here

00:18:01.979 --> 00:18:06.239
Caption: is the majority of your users aren&#39;t

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.579
Caption: running those top end devices this is

00:18:06.239 --> 00:18:11.160
Caption: like if you&#39;re um who here has an iPhone

00:18:08.579 --> 00:18:13.260
Caption: and is running tests on it regularly

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.400
Caption: caught one person

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260
Caption: um

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.000
Caption: this one person I can tell you that baby

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.039
Caption: what you&#39;re doing is not representative

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.939
Caption: of what the majority of your users are

00:18:20.038 --> 00:18:22.939
Caption: experiencing so

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.359
Caption: to put it another way and this is

00:18:25.859 --> 00:18:28.678
Caption: obviously with old data we&#39;ve got a new

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:30.900
Caption: iPhone that&#39;s just come out so this is

00:18:28.678 --> 00:18:33.119
Caption: going to change again the difference in

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:36.960
Caption: performance between those two devices is

00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:39.119
Caption: so significant that uh like this we&#39;ve

00:18:36.959 --> 00:18:40.260
Caption: got a coin we&#39;ve got a term that&#39;s been

00:18:39.119 --> 00:18:42.538
Caption: coined for this it&#39;s called the

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.558
Caption: performance inequality Gap

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:45.599
Caption: um

00:18:43.558 --> 00:18:46.739
Caption: yeah that that&#39;s a that&#39;s a big

00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:48.298
Caption: difference there

00:18:46.739 --> 00:18:49.619
Caption: um that was actually coined by by this

00:18:48.298 --> 00:18:50.880
Caption: guy he&#39;s uh he does some really

00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:52.678
Caption: interesting talks on that I&#39;ve got some

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.178
Caption: links at the end to the talks that this

00:18:52.678 --> 00:18:54.899
Caption: guy&#39;s done before

00:18:54.178 --> 00:18:57.538
Caption: um

00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:00.179
Caption: he he has a really interesting part on

00:18:57.538 --> 00:19:02.099
Caption: his talk where uh he&#39;s running these

00:19:00.178 --> 00:19:04.500
Caption: performance but uh performance

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:07.619
Caption: benchmarks on these devices

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:11.699
Caption: um and just to sort of add to this as

00:19:07.619 --> 00:19:13.079
Caption: well um he&#39;s got a Nexus 5x he&#39;s tested

00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:14.159
Caption: it once and then he puts it on top of a

00:19:13.079 --> 00:19:16.380
Caption: block of ice

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.700
Caption: um and that that device now performs 15

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.260
Caption: faster

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:21.359
Caption: so that&#39;s really interesting this now

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.640
Caption: means that environment the environment

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:25.918
Caption: in which you run your your website and

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.900
Caption: and these benchmarks are working in also

00:19:25.918 --> 00:19:29.639
Caption: changes performance so that that score

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.640
Caption: that you had before that could be 15

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.140
Caption: higher or 15 percent lower

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.280
Caption: um and this isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t just sort

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.140
Caption: of like no one&#39;s actually running their

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.900
Caption: devices on a block of ice but if you&#39;re

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.579
Caption: outside on a 40 degree day in Perth you

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.460
Caption: could actually have users that are

00:19:41.579 --> 00:19:45.659
Caption: experiencing your your site with 15 less

00:19:44.459 --> 00:19:47.219
Caption: performance

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.599
Caption: um so this is this is a real thing that

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:50.520
Caption: um does come up when we&#39;re talking about

00:19:48.599 --> 00:19:52.918
Caption: uh real world sort of metrics and real

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.479
Caption: world tracking

00:19:52.918 --> 00:19:57.119
Caption: another thing that&#39;s really important is

00:19:54.479 --> 00:20:00.599
Caption: I think a lot of us uh work under the

00:19:57.119 --> 00:20:02.400
Caption: assumption that um networks are widely

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:04.619
Caption: widely a lot faster and a lot more

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:07.320
Caption: capable than they&#39;ve ever been um 4G

00:20:04.619 --> 00:20:09.119
Caption: itself is very widely available that&#39;s

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:12.119
Caption: great that&#39;s a bit of a miracle actually

00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:13.558
Caption: because it&#39;s pulling us forward we have

00:20:12.119 --> 00:20:16.439
Caption: a significant

00:20:13.558 --> 00:20:18.239
Caption: um uh reduction in in the use of like

00:20:16.439 --> 00:20:20.099
Caption: our sort of four second budget four

00:20:18.239 --> 00:20:22.859
Caption: seconds is for LCP

00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:25.619
Caption: um we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve made huge strides and

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:28.020
Caption: and all sites are generally a lot better

00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:29.819
Caption: performing for this but that only works

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.459
Caption: under the assumption that 4G networks

00:20:29.819 --> 00:20:34.619
Caption: are evenly distributed which they&#39;re not

00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:38.219
Caption: if we look at the sort of variance

00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:40.199
Caption: within wa in 4G network speeds at the

00:20:38.219 --> 00:20:42.058
Caption: low end you&#39;ve got about 18 megabytes

00:20:40.199 --> 00:20:45.959
Caption: per second and at the high end you&#39;re

00:20:42.058 --> 00:20:48.178
Caption: talking almost 10 times higher than that

00:20:45.959 --> 00:20:50.699
Caption: same goes for latency

00:20:48.178 --> 00:20:53.399
Caption: latency can differ very significantly

00:20:50.699 --> 00:20:55.918
Caption: particularly on 4G networks 4G by the

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.200
Caption: way networks the majority of devices are

00:20:55.918 --> 00:21:00.298
Caption: browsing on as well so

00:20:58.199 --> 00:21:01.739
Caption: um that that is where you&#39;re going to

00:21:00.298 --> 00:21:03.479
Caption: see the majority of your devices and the

00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:05.038
Caption: majority of of your users with their

00:21:03.479 --> 00:21:08.959
Caption: devices are going to be experiencing

00:21:05.038 --> 00:21:08.959
Caption: this sort of variance in performance

00:21:09.058 --> 00:21:12.178
Caption: so hopefully that tells you that we

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:14.760
Caption: probably need to actually start

00:21:12.178 --> 00:21:17.099
Caption: monitoring on real devices so that we

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.260
Caption: can account for environmental factors

00:21:17.099 --> 00:21:21.719
Caption: different 4G networks and different

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:25.520
Caption: temperatures as it turns out as well as

00:21:21.719 --> 00:21:25.520
Caption: different CPU performance on devices

00:21:26.099 --> 00:21:29.819
Caption: so what is real user monitoring

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.500
Caption: real user monitoring is capturing

00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:33.178
Caption: performance metrics directly from

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.939
Caption: devices so that we can observe

00:21:33.178 --> 00:21:38.959
Caption: differences in functionality reliability

00:21:35.939 --> 00:21:38.959
Caption: and responsiveness

00:21:39.058 --> 00:21:44.640
Caption: so an example of how to do

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:47.819
Caption: real user monitoring might be the Chrome

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:50.219
Caption: user experience reform so I think we all

00:21:47.819 --> 00:21:51.599
Caption: know that Chrome while you&#39;re browsing

00:21:50.219 --> 00:21:53.699
Caption: the internet is doing all sorts of

00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:55.319
Caption: tracking um some of it&#39;s good some of

00:21:53.699 --> 00:21:56.339
Caption: it&#39;s not so good this is maybe one of

00:21:55.319 --> 00:21:58.739
Caption: the

00:21:56.339 --> 00:21:59.520
Caption: the gooder ones I&#39;d say

00:21:58.739 --> 00:22:01.859
Caption: um

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.020
Caption: every single website you visit Google is

00:22:01.859 --> 00:22:05.699
Caption: sending uh it&#39;s it&#39;s anonymizing and

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:09.058
Caption: then sending um

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:11.760
Caption: web vitals metrics to itself it collates

00:22:09.058 --> 00:22:14.399
Caption: all of those metrics and makes this data

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.959
Caption: set completely free and available to you

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.059
Caption: so you can pull down this data set now

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:19.859
Caption: for a site that you manage and you can

00:22:18.058 --> 00:22:23.719
Caption: see how it&#39;s performing on real world

00:22:19.859 --> 00:22:23.719
Caption: devices across the internet

00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:29.939
Caption: the Chrome user experience report is

00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:31.918
Caption: great because it&#39;s free you can see I

00:22:29.939 --> 00:22:33.719
Caption: can go and see the Chrome user

00:22:31.918 --> 00:22:36.359
Caption: experience report for google.com or

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:38.939
Caption: facebook.com it&#39;s widely available

00:22:36.359 --> 00:22:40.558
Caption: it does do real user monitoring so cool

00:22:38.939 --> 00:22:43.319
Caption: ticks that box

00:22:40.558 --> 00:22:44.939
Caption: the one downside is that it doesn&#39;t give

00:22:43.319 --> 00:22:47.819
Caption: you these metrics in real time so you

00:22:44.939 --> 00:22:49.678
Caption: can pull this report once a month

00:22:47.819 --> 00:22:51.599
Caption: um that&#39;s that&#39;s a bit unfortunate

00:22:49.678 --> 00:22:53.038
Caption: because if we wanted to if we made a

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:55.678
Caption: change and we were worried about the

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:56.399
Caption: performance that feedback loop is too

00:22:55.678 --> 00:22:58.859
Caption: long

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.479
Caption: uh what happens there is uh you might

00:22:58.859 --> 00:23:03.359
Caption: make a sort of a performance regression

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:04.859
Caption: you incur the cost of that performance

00:23:03.359 --> 00:23:06.658
Caption: regression for an entire month before

00:23:04.859 --> 00:23:07.979
Caption: knowing that you&#39;ve done that and then

00:23:06.659 --> 00:23:10.320
Caption: then you have to go and try and figure

00:23:07.979 --> 00:23:12.298
Caption: out what caused that a month later so

00:23:10.319 --> 00:23:14.038
Caption: that&#39;s not ideal the other thing is this

00:23:12.298 --> 00:23:16.199
Caption: only profiles Google Chrome devices so

00:23:14.038 --> 00:23:18.058
Caption: you don&#39;t get realistic real user

00:23:16.199 --> 00:23:19.439
Caption: monitoring for iOS devices based on

00:23:18.058 --> 00:23:22.020
Caption: webkit and actually not even all Chrome

00:23:19.439 --> 00:23:24.239
Caption: devices just Google Chrome so not like

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.979
Caption: blink Microsoft Edge or anything like

00:23:24.239 --> 00:23:27.719
Caption: that they&#39;re not sending data to Google

00:23:25.979 --> 00:23:31.219
Caption: for you

00:23:27.719 --> 00:23:31.219
Caption: um so it&#39;s not representing everyone

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:37.320
Caption: here&#39;s another tool um this kind of

00:23:33.959 --> 00:23:38.399
Caption: fixes the uh with the Google Chrome user

00:23:37.319 --> 00:23:39.839
Caption: experience report

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.799
Caption: um there&#39;s a couple of Hoops you have to

00:23:39.839 --> 00:23:42.359
Caption: jump through you have to get a Google

00:23:40.798 --> 00:23:43.380
Caption: account and then use this data Studio

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:45.000
Caption: thing

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.140
Caption: um set it up this kind of just makes

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.400
Caption: this a whole lot easier you don&#39;t have

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.320
Caption: to create an account or anything like

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.479
Caption: that you can just plug in a site right

00:23:49.319 --> 00:23:53.158
Caption: now anyone here could just do this in

00:23:51.479 --> 00:23:55.199
Caption: about two seconds it&#39;s made by the

00:23:53.159 --> 00:23:57.179
Caption: caliber people too

00:23:55.199 --> 00:23:59.038
Caption: and

00:23:57.178 --> 00:24:00.599
Caption: I&#39;ve been told to put the sponsor slide

00:23:59.038 --> 00:24:02.279
Caption: either at the beginning or the end so

00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:03.538
Caption: the DDD people are probably panicking

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.159
Caption: now because I&#39;m about halfway through

00:24:03.538 --> 00:24:07.139
Caption: and I&#39;ve got the slide here like an easy

00:24:05.159 --> 00:24:09.120
Caption: finish now

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.440
Caption: um I&#39;ve decided to do something probably

00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:12.538
Caption: that might get me a little bit in

00:24:10.439 --> 00:24:13.678
Caption: trouble but I&#39;m going to do a sponsor

00:24:12.538 --> 00:24:15.959
Caption: leaderboard so I&#39;m going to go through

00:24:13.678 --> 00:24:18.859
Caption: all of the sponsors to tell you how fast

00:24:15.959 --> 00:24:18.859
Caption: your sites are going to perform

00:24:21.319 --> 00:24:26.279
Caption: yeah yeah all right so um just some

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.239
Caption: ground rules when we start um this is

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.619
Caption: how I&#39;m going to run the tour I&#39;m going

00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:30.119
Caption: to run it across the whole domain you

00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:31.439
Caption: tend to get better results um it&#39;s more

00:24:30.119 --> 00:24:32.579
Caption: representative of everything that&#39;s

00:24:31.439 --> 00:24:35.879
Caption: going on

00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:37.079
Caption: um as well as uh there are some sites

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.359
Caption: that aren&#39;t going to have enough traffic

00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:42.239
Caption: so you need I think at least a thousand

00:24:39.359 --> 00:24:43.199
Caption: visits on Google Chrome per month um so

00:24:42.239 --> 00:24:44.760
Caption: some of them are going to get missed out

00:24:43.199 --> 00:24:47.699
Caption: there and the other thing is I&#39;m going

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:50.579
Caption: to order this dashboard in descending

00:24:47.699 --> 00:24:52.319
Caption: order from uh at the LCP metric because

00:24:50.579 --> 00:24:54.899
Caption: I think that one&#39;s most important we

00:24:52.319 --> 00:24:57.298
Caption: touched on that before the case study

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:59.580
Caption: for Vodafone that tends to be the one

00:24:57.298 --> 00:25:02.099
Caption: that&#39;s tied to commercial benefit so

00:24:59.579 --> 00:25:03.899
Caption: we&#39;re going to go that one

00:25:02.099 --> 00:25:07.439
Caption: so a couple of people got off the hook

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:09.539
Caption: didn&#39;t get enough traffic so

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:12.379
Caption: good for them

00:25:09.538 --> 00:25:12.379
Caption: maybe next year

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.859
Caption: and this one&#39;s a little bit embarrassing

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.080
Caption: so I I work for one of these companies

00:25:16.859 --> 00:25:21.119
Caption: it&#39;s the one on number 20 there so what

00:25:19.079 --> 00:25:23.038
Caption: happened there um I can I can explain

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:25.319
Caption: that and I think I will

00:25:23.038 --> 00:25:27.658
Caption: um that website there is more more so a

00:25:25.319 --> 00:25:29.939
Caption: recruitment tool than it is the website

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:33.659
Caption: that we derived commercial benefit from

00:25:29.939 --> 00:25:35.219
Caption: so that&#39;s why that&#39;s like that also I

00:25:33.659 --> 00:25:38.039
Caption: have nothing to do with that one so

00:25:35.219 --> 00:25:39.599
Caption: that&#39;s probably why it&#39;s like that

00:25:38.038 --> 00:25:41.819
Caption: um some other interesting scores here we

00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:44.278
Caption: have the lower score obviously for FCP

00:25:41.819 --> 00:25:46.079
Caption: and LCP on this on this dashboard really

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:47.159
Caption: interesting though that for insight not

00:25:46.079 --> 00:25:48.000
Caption: sure what happened

00:25:47.159 --> 00:25:50.820
Caption: um

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.959
Caption: the FCP is larger than the LCP so a bit

00:25:50.819 --> 00:25:54.239
Caption: confusing I don&#39;t think that&#39;s actually

00:25:51.959 --> 00:25:56.699
Caption: possible maybe that&#39;s a dud result scrub

00:25:54.239 --> 00:25:58.558
Caption: that off now we&#39;re last great there&#39;s

00:25:56.699 --> 00:26:00.359
Caption: also a zero score for cumulative layout

00:25:58.558 --> 00:26:01.979
Caption: shift here so good good on family zone

00:26:00.359 --> 00:26:03.839
Caption: for doing that

00:26:01.979 --> 00:26:06.058
Caption: let&#39;s move up the board here

00:26:03.839 --> 00:26:07.380
Caption: some more interesting results uh what

00:26:06.058 --> 00:26:09.599
Caption: have we got

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:12.119
Caption: um Planet testing has a interesting

00:26:09.599 --> 00:26:14.579
Caption: score for cumulative layout shift of one

00:26:12.119 --> 00:26:16.619
Caption: I&#39;m not sure what to make of that that&#39;s

00:26:14.579 --> 00:26:18.298
Caption: a bit odd to me maybe that&#39;s just a bad

00:26:16.619 --> 00:26:19.558
Caption: result as well

00:26:18.298 --> 00:26:22.260
Caption: um we&#39;ve got Bunnings along the middle

00:26:19.558 --> 00:26:24.418
Caption: there um I should say that uh when I&#39;m

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:27.479
Caption: identifying this stuff obviously this is

00:26:24.418 --> 00:26:28.739
Caption: this could be taken or construed as a

00:26:27.479 --> 00:26:30.359
Caption: bit of a roast

00:26:28.739 --> 00:26:32.099
Caption: um but I also say this is an opportunity

00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:33.058
Caption: for improvement until you see something

00:26:32.099 --> 00:26:35.699
Caption: like this

00:26:33.058 --> 00:26:38.038
Caption: um anyone work for Bunnings

00:26:35.699 --> 00:26:39.418
Caption: cool add the back this is a really uh

00:26:38.038 --> 00:26:40.979
Caption: there&#39;s probably something really simple

00:26:39.418 --> 00:26:42.239
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s causing something like

00:26:40.979 --> 00:26:44.400
Caption: this especially if it&#39;s right across the

00:26:42.239 --> 00:26:47.099
Caption: board so there might be opportunity for

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.839
Caption: improvement uh here have a quick look at

00:26:47.099 --> 00:26:52.319
Caption: it uh it might sort of highlight

00:26:48.839 --> 00:26:55.020
Caption: something that you hadn&#39;t seen before

00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:56.639
Caption: uh We&#39;ve also got the best score for

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:59.400
Caption: first input Delay from Telstra purple

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.839
Caption: here so good for them and I I&#39;ve got an

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.239
Caption: interesting result here as well so

00:27:00.839 --> 00:27:04.918
Caption: Bankwest best score for time to First

00:27:03.239 --> 00:27:08.880
Caption: buy awesome

00:27:04.918 --> 00:27:12.479
Caption: better than AWS so global

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:15.058
Caption: globally redundant uh massive Network

00:27:12.479 --> 00:27:18.000
Caption: probably the largest single Network in

00:27:15.058 --> 00:27:19.678
Caption: in history ever made and Bankwest dingy

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.239
Caption: little Bank from Perth better time to

00:27:19.678 --> 00:27:22.439
Caption: First buy it so whatever whatever the

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:25.038
Caption: Bankwest people are doing is probably

00:27:22.439 --> 00:27:25.038
Caption: pretty good

00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:29.038
Caption: yeah yeah so actually that is a good

00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:30.778
Caption: point um Data Center and customers

00:27:29.038 --> 00:27:32.099
Caption: majority in Perth so

00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:34.320
Caption: um that&#39;s probably where that&#39;s coming

00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:36.119
Caption: from obviously AWS much more distributed

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:38.759
Caption: so

00:27:36.119 --> 00:27:40.678
Caption: now and here&#39;s the final result so

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.298
Caption: who saw that one coming uh TD Perth

00:27:40.678 --> 00:27:43.619
Caption: number two there&#39;s obviously some really

00:27:42.298 --> 00:27:45.899
Caption: smart people putting that one together

00:27:43.619 --> 00:27:48.359
Caption: the only green across the board score

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:50.880
Caption: was Versant so good job to them and then

00:27:48.359 --> 00:27:52.260
Caption: number one score is GitHub

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.839
Caption: um anyone have any theories about like

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:58.520
Caption: github&#39;s number one aside from massive

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:58.520
Caption: investment in web performance

00:27:58.739 --> 00:28:01.278
Caption: race

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.099
Caption: yep

00:28:06.058 --> 00:28:09.899
Caption: so for anyone who didn&#39;t hear yeah

00:28:08.099 --> 00:28:11.880
Caption: Reese&#39;s mum doesn&#39;t use GitHub as it

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.260
Caption: turns out I kind of I kind of assumed

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.039
Caption: she did but

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.339
Caption: um

00:28:14.038 --> 00:28:19.798
Caption: also yeah uh desktop devices majority of

00:28:17.339 --> 00:28:21.538
Caption: people with like high-powered devices uh

00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:23.099
Caption: largely text based pretty much all

00:28:21.538 --> 00:28:25.379
Caption: textbooks as well that tends to help so

00:28:23.099 --> 00:28:27.119
Caption: largest contentful pain if you&#39;ve got

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.739
Caption: images on the page you&#39;ll be impacted by

00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:31.140
Caption: that so some some of these scores as

00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:32.520
Caption: well should be mentioned that um take

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.020
Caption: them with a bit of a grain of salt it&#39;s

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.880
Caption: like it&#39;s not that GitHub is doing

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.979
Caption: something particularly special sometimes

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.479
Caption: it&#39;s actually more more the user base

00:28:37.979 --> 00:28:41.099
Caption: themselves

00:28:39.479 --> 00:28:42.359
Caption: um but again yeah plenty of opportunity

00:28:41.099 --> 00:28:43.918
Caption: for improvement here as well

00:28:42.359 --> 00:28:45.298
Caption: particularly if you&#39;ve got some of the

00:28:43.918 --> 00:28:46.859
Caption: results on this sort of part of the

00:28:45.298 --> 00:28:48.058
Caption: board as well there might be something

00:28:46.859 --> 00:28:49.439
Caption: really simple

00:28:48.058 --> 00:28:50.699
Caption: I&#39;m not going to talk about that in this

00:28:49.439 --> 00:28:53.158
Caption: talk though that that&#39;s probably the

00:28:50.699 --> 00:28:54.599
Caption: next one see you next year

00:28:53.159 --> 00:28:56.220
Caption: all right so we figured out how to

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:57.839
Caption: capture metrics from end user devices

00:28:56.219 --> 00:28:59.459
Caption: there&#39;s a number of really easy ways to

00:28:57.839 --> 00:29:01.140
Caption: do it

00:28:59.459 --> 00:29:03.119
Caption: but we&#39;re still missing continuous

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.979
Caption: observability so we&#39;ve got our Chrome

00:29:03.119 --> 00:29:07.798
Caption: user experience report we can get these

00:29:04.979 --> 00:29:08.939
Caption: we can get this data but we can get it

00:29:07.798 --> 00:29:10.019
Caption: once a month so that&#39;s not really good

00:29:08.939 --> 00:29:13.038
Caption: enough we need to be able to see this

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.039
Caption: data at real time

00:29:14.038 --> 00:29:18.418
Caption: uh here&#39;s a bit of a our progress as we

00:29:16.558 --> 00:29:20.219
Caption: go here so you can see

00:29:18.418 --> 00:29:21.599
Caption: um we we&#39;re improving along the way

00:29:20.219 --> 00:29:23.219
Caption: there but we don&#39;t currently have that

00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:26.239
Caption: solution that gives us all three we

00:29:23.219 --> 00:29:26.239
Caption: haven&#39;t quite worked that out yet

00:29:27.178 --> 00:29:31.859
Caption: so if we if we can&#39;t find an off shelf

00:29:29.699 --> 00:29:34.139
Caption: that&#39;s off the shelf tool

00:29:31.859 --> 00:29:35.880
Caption: um why don&#39;t we just ask ourselves is it

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.799
Caption: really that hard to build yourself an

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.479
Caption: analytic service can we build it

00:29:37.798 --> 00:29:41.278
Caption: ourselves we might as well have a try

00:29:39.479 --> 00:29:42.959
Caption: we&#39;ve been through all the tools nothing

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:44.039
Caption: seems to be quite hitting the mark on

00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:45.719
Caption: all three

00:29:44.038 --> 00:29:46.979
Caption: uh actually does that it&#39;s really easy

00:29:45.719 --> 00:29:48.898
Caption: so

00:29:46.979 --> 00:29:51.418
Caption: um you can grab this Library this is the

00:29:48.899 --> 00:29:53.220
Caption: web vitals Library it&#39;s the same library

00:29:51.418 --> 00:29:54.719
Caption: that I guess they built into Google

00:29:53.219 --> 00:29:56.760
Caption: Chrome it can give you the same scores

00:29:54.719 --> 00:29:59.339
Caption: but you can run JavaScript you can pull

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:01.979
Caption: that down and um it looks a bit a little

00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:04.558
Caption: bit like this you can just import a

00:30:01.979 --> 00:30:06.839
Caption: bunch of functions you can add callbacks

00:30:04.558 --> 00:30:09.000
Caption: to them that&#39;s send to analytics

00:30:06.839 --> 00:30:10.500
Caption: function I&#39;ll get to that in a sec but

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.640
Caption: um we can also while we&#39;re here if we&#39;re

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.319
Caption: going to send something to our little

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.659
Caption: analytics service we can capture some

00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:18.479
Caption: other stuff as well so JavaScript errors

00:30:15.659 --> 00:30:20.760
Caption: content security policy violations we

00:30:18.479 --> 00:30:22.739
Caption: can send all of that stuff down there

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.558
Caption: that Center analytics function looks

00:30:22.739 --> 00:30:27.119
Caption: like this it maybe looks a little I&#39;ve

00:30:25.558 --> 00:30:29.099
Caption: got I&#39;ve got prettier run over this so

00:30:27.119 --> 00:30:31.979
Caption: maybe looks a little bit hard to read

00:30:29.099 --> 00:30:33.839
Caption: um it just sends a sends a request down

00:30:31.979 --> 00:30:36.538
Caption: to a server so we can start reporting

00:30:33.839 --> 00:30:38.278
Caption: these metrics that navigator.send Beacon

00:30:36.538 --> 00:30:40.979
Caption: way is it better to better way to send

00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:44.220
Caption: metrics like this because it can finish

00:30:40.979 --> 00:30:46.500
Caption: the request after your or somewhat after

00:30:44.219 --> 00:30:47.939
Caption: your page unloads and goes to the next

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.260
Caption: page so if your user clicks on on

00:30:47.939 --> 00:30:51.000
Caption: something and you really want to quickly

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.260
Caption: report a metric there or an error or

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.819
Caption: something like that that&#39;s more likely

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:56.579
Caption: to capture it but let&#39;s fall back to

00:30:53.819 --> 00:30:59.519
Caption: fetch just in case

00:30:56.579 --> 00:31:01.439
Caption: and of doing a bit of like I&#39;m doing a

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.179
Caption: bit of code golf here so I&#39;ve tried to

00:31:01.439 --> 00:31:05.099
Caption: compress it all into one page but this

00:31:03.178 --> 00:31:06.658
Caption: is the entire server this is the whole

00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:09.479
Caption: thing

00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:11.220
Caption: um so really 24 lines of code is all it

00:31:09.479 --> 00:31:13.199
Caption: took we can see here that we&#39;re

00:31:11.219 --> 00:31:14.939
Caption: importing this prom client Library which

00:31:13.199 --> 00:31:16.678
Caption: is the Prometheus Library we&#39;ll get to

00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:19.379
Caption: that in a minute we can set up our

00:31:16.678 --> 00:31:21.599
Caption: metrics like this we&#39;re using summary

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.399
Caption: metrics so that allows us to observe uh

00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:24.898
Caption: time distributions

00:31:23.399 --> 00:31:26.880
Caption: and then that&#39;s the service just an

00:31:24.899 --> 00:31:29.460
Caption: Express web server depending on which

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:32.000
Caption: metric we get back we&#39;ll just observe

00:31:29.459 --> 00:31:32.000
Caption: each one of those

00:31:32.279 --> 00:31:36.720
Caption: so then moving on from there we&#39;ve got

00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:39.538
Caption: our analytics server in the middle and

00:31:36.719 --> 00:31:41.699
Caption: then because it&#39;s just a really simple

00:31:39.538 --> 00:31:43.918
Caption: web server we don&#39;t have

00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:45.418
Caption: um it&#39;s not sort of paired with the

00:31:43.918 --> 00:31:46.619
Caption: database there&#39;s no persistence or

00:31:45.418 --> 00:31:48.959
Caption: anything like that we can keep our

00:31:46.619 --> 00:31:51.178
Caption: metrics in memory um the way of doing

00:31:48.959 --> 00:31:53.880
Caption: this with Prometheus is it&#39;s pull based

00:31:51.178 --> 00:31:55.558
Caption: so that&#39;s polling on a continuous basis

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.298
Caption: our analytics service for the latest

00:31:55.558 --> 00:31:59.520
Caption: version of the metrics keeping track of

00:31:57.298 --> 00:32:01.079
Caption: that and then we&#39;ve got grafana slapped

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.399
Caption: on top of that because grafana has

00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:04.140
Caption: really nice pretty graphs which we&#39;ll

00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:05.760
Caption: show in a minute

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:08.339
Caption: um but this is dead simple and because

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.079
Caption: we&#39;ve rolled our own analytics service

00:32:08.339 --> 00:32:11.640
Caption: I&#39;m not going to tell you all to use

00:32:10.079 --> 00:32:13.019
Caption: Prometheus and grafana that&#39;s what I use

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:15.659
Caption: but there&#39;s nothing stopping you from

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:17.219
Caption: hooking this up to Honeycomb or sending

00:32:15.659 --> 00:32:18.899
Caption: this data to New Relic if you wanted to

00:32:17.219 --> 00:32:20.760
Caption: there&#39;s about a million different

00:32:18.899 --> 00:32:21.840
Caption: options for for this and you can send it

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.880
Caption: wherever you want and because you&#39;ve

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:26.658
Caption: written your own code for this that is

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.659
Caption: completely up to you

00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:31.500
Caption: so here&#39;s another example where we might

00:32:29.038 --> 00:32:32.819
Caption: want to store a metrics for more

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.279
Caption: long-term use

00:32:32.819 --> 00:32:38.038
Caption: so you&#39;ve got Amazon Kinesis firehose

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:40.200
Caption: and S3 and then you can use snowflake to

00:32:38.038 --> 00:32:42.959
Caption: run queries over that data

00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:44.278
Caption: um dead simple also there&#39;s probably 15

00:32:42.959 --> 00:32:46.979
Caption: 000 different ways to do this as well

00:32:44.279 --> 00:32:49.619
Caption: this is just one example I don&#39;t I don&#39;t

00:32:46.979 --> 00:32:50.819
Caption: we don&#39;t do this yet but um yeah I can I

00:32:49.619 --> 00:32:52.619
Caption: can see there being value and sort of

00:32:50.819 --> 00:32:54.058
Caption: having a long long term trends for those

00:32:52.619 --> 00:32:56.339
Caption: metrics rather than something that lives

00:32:54.058 --> 00:32:58.319
Caption: in memory so as soon as those uh

00:32:56.339 --> 00:33:00.619
Caption: containers are dead then you have to

00:32:58.319 --> 00:33:00.619
Caption: start again

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:06.719
Caption: and this is what we end up with so this

00:33:03.178 --> 00:33:08.640
Caption: is grafana a quick video from grafana

00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:11.699
Caption: we&#39;re tracking all of those metrics

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.919
Caption: we&#39;ve got an instant instantaneous score

00:33:11.699 --> 00:33:15.839
Caption: so that&#39;s really helpful for

00:33:13.918 --> 00:33:16.979
Caption: um if we&#39;ve made a quick change we can

00:33:15.839 --> 00:33:18.719
Caption: just look at that and see if that

00:33:16.979 --> 00:33:20.760
Caption: number&#39;s gone up we can observe Trends

00:33:18.719 --> 00:33:24.719
Caption: over time I&#39;ve got heat Maps there so

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:26.399
Caption: I&#39;ve got a um a histogram type metric as

00:33:24.719 --> 00:33:28.918
Caption: well and that allows us to sort of see

00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:30.600
Caption: that distribution over time and we can

00:33:28.918 --> 00:33:32.219
Caption: kind of observe any of those Trends

00:33:30.599 --> 00:33:34.439
Caption: there so that&#39;s really useful I really

00:33:32.219 --> 00:33:36.538
Caption: like the one in the the bottom right as

00:33:34.439 --> 00:33:38.459
Caption: well those are tied to the actual

00:33:36.538 --> 00:33:41.278
Caption: performance scores

00:33:38.459 --> 00:33:43.439
Caption: um that I showed you before so green is

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:45.539
Caption: in that good space and then anything

00:33:43.439 --> 00:33:46.918
Caption: above that is red

00:33:45.538 --> 00:33:48.719
Caption: um we can see how often we&#39;re going into

00:33:46.918 --> 00:33:51.119
Caption: that red there so that&#39;s really really

00:33:48.719 --> 00:33:53.880
Caption: helpful too

00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:56.399
Caption: if you remember we also sent some other

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.959
Caption: stuff to our analytics service so now

00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:59.159
Caption: that we&#39;ve got this this server we can

00:33:57.959 --> 00:34:01.260
Caption: kind of start reporting on everything

00:33:59.159 --> 00:34:03.779
Caption: that&#39;s going on as well so I&#39;ve got some

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:06.058
Caption: geolocation stuff in there which devices

00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:07.860
Caption: uh people are using because we have our

00:34:06.058 --> 00:34:09.838
Caption: own analytics server it&#39;s really easy to

00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:12.239
Caption: just keep adding more to it

00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:15.060
Caption: this is where I got the device data from

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:18.479
Caption: as well from the previous slides

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:20.339
Caption: so yeah to recap

00:34:18.479 --> 00:34:22.320
Caption: best way to do web performance

00:34:20.339 --> 00:34:24.000
Caption: monitoring is to do three things you

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.040
Caption: need user-centric performance metrics

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.439
Caption: you need to capture those performance

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.479
Caption: metrics from Real World devices

00:34:28.439 --> 00:34:31.918
Caption: and you need to be able to continuously

00:34:30.479 --> 00:34:34.020
Caption: observe those so we need to be able to

00:34:31.918 --> 00:34:37.739
Caption: see the advantage of being able to

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:39.719
Caption: continuously observe is we can capture a

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:41.580
Caption: quick regression we can have a PR that

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:43.560
Caption: gets merged everything starts running oh

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.359
Caption: look it&#39;s something&#39;s gone wrong the the

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:47.099
Caption: performance profile has changed in the

00:34:45.358 --> 00:34:48.539
Caption: wrong way we can roll that back very

00:34:47.099 --> 00:34:49.980
Caption: quickly

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:52.139
Caption: um yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s all of it that&#39;s

00:34:49.979 --> 00:34:53.040
Caption: that&#39;s the three the three goals we did

00:34:52.138 --> 00:34:55.699
Caption: it

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.699
Caption: thanks everyone

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.339
Caption: that&#39;s me if you want to if you want to

00:35:03.419 --> 00:35:07.739
Caption: like attack me on Twitter for uh

00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:09.119
Caption: roasting the the place where you work so

00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:10.320
Caption: uh that&#39;s that&#39;s how you do that if you

00:35:09.118 --> 00:35:13.019
Caption: want to know

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.940
Caption: um I&#39;ve also got all the resources here

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:16.979
Caption: um you can find my slides

00:35:14.939 --> 00:35:19.319
Caption: um using using any of those links there

00:35:16.979 --> 00:35:20.838
Caption: I&#39;ll share them out so all the resources

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:24.060
Caption: everything I talked about is there

00:35:20.839 --> 00:35:26.640
Caption: here&#39;s how to learn about all of those

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:29.459
Caption: metrics as well more than just the 10

00:35:26.639 --> 00:35:30.899
Caption: seconds I gave them on stage here&#39;s some

00:35:29.459 --> 00:35:34.260
Caption: really useful tools so all the tools I

00:35:30.899 --> 00:35:36.838
Caption: covered versus some other stuff as well

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.760
Caption: has anyone got any questions

00:35:36.839 --> 00:35:41.099
Caption: race

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.500
Caption: making me nervous man

00:35:41.099 --> 00:35:44.760
Caption: um no I just wanted to get your opinion

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.839
Caption: so those

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:50.399
Caption: um Google had those kind of green to Red

00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:52.500
Caption: not so good good

00:35:50.399 --> 00:35:54.479
Caption: um I was kind of surprised that the

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.820
Caption: numbers nowadays are still quite High I

00:35:54.479 --> 00:35:58.919
Caption: think you said 1.8 seconds her first

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.739
Caption: contentful paint

00:35:58.919 --> 00:36:04.020
Caption: like I shut it 1.8 seconds oh my God

00:36:01.739 --> 00:36:05.040
Caption: what are we doing like you know what are

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.439
Caption: your feelings on that am I being

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.359
Caption: ridiculous or is what&#39;s good for Macklin

00:36:07.439 --> 00:36:10.379
Caption: what do you think is good what are you

00:36:09.358 --> 00:36:12.299
Caption: aiming for

00:36:10.379 --> 00:36:13.679
Caption: I think you might be surprised um like

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.760
Caption: if we go back to I&#39;m not going to go

00:36:13.679 --> 00:36:16.139
Caption: back to the leaderboards you guys don&#39;t

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.300
Caption: need to see that again but if you go

00:36:16.139 --> 00:36:19.858
Caption: back to the leaderboards um quite a lot

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.660
Caption: of first content for pain I don&#39;t think

00:36:19.858 --> 00:36:23.819
Caption: anyone got less than a second

00:36:21.659 --> 00:36:25.078
Caption: um less than a second uh sounds really

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.920
Caption: good that sounds like what you&#39;d want

00:36:25.079 --> 00:36:27.780
Caption: but

00:36:25.919 --> 00:36:29.520
Caption: um it is actually pretty hard to get to

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.320
Caption: that to that score

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.500
Caption: um and I think Google has said it in

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:36.839
Caption: such a way that I think it accounts for

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:38.699
Caption: uh accounts for that variability so not

00:36:36.839 --> 00:36:40.980
Caption: everyone has a device that&#39;s going to

00:36:38.699 --> 00:36:43.260
Caption: ensure that we can get it in 1.8 seconds

00:36:40.979 --> 00:36:45.540
Caption: the majority of people have devices that

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:48.000
Caption: are significantly slower than the device

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.400
Caption: you and I probably use it&#39;s accounting

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.540
Caption: for that&#39;s accounting for people in in

00:36:50.399 --> 00:36:54.000
Caption: uh

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:56.599
Caption: jurisdictions like geolocations like

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.099
Caption: rural Australia or

00:36:56.599 --> 00:37:00.480
Caption: parts of India and stuff like that where

00:36:59.099 --> 00:37:02.040
Caption: they are going to not actually be able

00:37:00.479 --> 00:37:04.219
Caption: to attain that level of performance as

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.219
Caption: well

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.979
Caption: um one of the 4G providers was 10 times

00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:19.098
Caption: faster than the others do you know who

00:37:16.979 --> 00:37:21.719
Caption: that was so I can switch my mobile plan

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:23.760
Caption: so the question was one of the one of

00:37:21.719 --> 00:37:26.338
Caption: the 4G providers was really fast it was

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.560
Caption: actually based on location so

00:37:26.339 --> 00:37:31.800
Caption: um and and it wasn&#39;t Perth either so

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:33.540
Caption: that that that that that shot that slide

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.520
Caption: was um

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.839
Caption: uh across wa

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:40.679
Caption: um you actually tend to find you get

00:37:36.839 --> 00:37:42.359
Caption: better performance in some rural but not

00:37:40.679 --> 00:37:44.459
Caption: very rural town so I think that might

00:37:42.358 --> 00:37:46.399
Caption: have been something like kalbari

00:37:44.459 --> 00:37:49.739
Caption: um they&#39;ve got a tower there it serves

00:37:46.399 --> 00:37:51.419
Caption: uh comparatively less people than it

00:37:49.739 --> 00:37:52.739
Caption: does in Perth so some Perth suburbs

00:37:51.419 --> 00:37:54.838
Caption: mostly sort of sit around the middle

00:37:52.739 --> 00:37:57.739
Caption: there and then very rural places will

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:57.739
Caption: have those lower scores

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:05.640
Caption: awesome talk man I love the uh sponsor

00:38:03.899 --> 00:38:06.199
Caption: comparison

00:38:05.639 --> 00:38:09.358
Caption: um

00:38:06.199 --> 00:38:12.179
Caption: we also at my company were using the

00:38:09.358 --> 00:38:14.519
Caption: Google library to send the analytics to

00:38:12.179 --> 00:38:17.040
Caption: in our case New Relic

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.959
Caption: um and New Relic also monitor that

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.520
Caption: through their own mechanism and we found

00:38:18.959 --> 00:38:22.560
Caption: that the numbers were different

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:25.739
Caption: and I just wondered if you&#39;d come across

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:28.439
Caption: different values for the core web vitals

00:38:25.739 --> 00:38:30.000
Caption: with different tooling

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:31.078
Caption: that&#39;s really interesting

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.679
Caption: um

00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:37.140
Caption: yeah I I they vary a lot and like um uh

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:39.179
Caption: if you just run two Google Lighthouse

00:38:37.139 --> 00:38:41.000
Caption: scores back to back you&#39;re not going to

00:38:39.179 --> 00:38:43.139
Caption: get the same results as well

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.179
Caption: but yeah even if we&#39;re kind of looking

00:38:43.139 --> 00:38:46.799
Caption: at exactly the same data I&#39;m not sure

00:38:45.179 --> 00:38:49.078
Caption: the difference there the one thing I

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:52.140
Caption: could probably say is maybe that web

00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:53.880
Caption: vitals Library it has to run sort of in

00:38:52.139 --> 00:38:56.279
Caption: JavaScript space JavaScript runtime

00:38:53.879 --> 00:38:57.838
Caption: whereas um the one that&#39;s built into

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.280
Caption: Google Chrome as much as they try and

00:38:57.839 --> 00:39:00.839
Caption: keep that the same maybe they can kind

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.159
Caption: of detect different things in in the

00:39:00.839 --> 00:39:04.020
Caption: browser and they come up with different

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:05.819
Caption: scores I&#39;d imagine they keep it as close

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.500
Caption: as they possibly can

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:09.420
Caption: um but yeah that&#39;s some sort of

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:12.419
Caption: variability in there how how much

00:39:09.419 --> 00:39:15.358
Caption: different was it out for you

00:39:12.419 --> 00:39:18.179
Caption: it was uh mostly around the CLS scores

00:39:15.358 --> 00:39:21.000
Caption: so like the New Relic one was very

00:39:18.179 --> 00:39:23.040
Caption: positive but the Google one was a bit it

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.139
Caption: felt more realistic so we sort of

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:27.540
Caption: trusted the Google JavaScript library

00:39:25.139 --> 00:39:29.639
Caption: more than new relics at the time

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:31.859
Caption: yeah that&#39;s interesting um

00:39:29.639 --> 00:39:33.299
Caption: I I don&#39;t know how nearly can put that

00:39:31.858 --> 00:39:36.539
Caption: together as well I imagine there&#39;s a

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:38.280
Caption: guide for how to put it together maybe

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.919
Caption: um I know that that web vitals library

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.659
Caption: is largely something that supports

00:39:40.919 --> 00:39:44.639
Caption: Chrome more than other browsers maybe

00:39:42.659 --> 00:39:46.618
Caption: New Relic went and rewrote it themselves

00:39:44.639 --> 00:39:49.858
Caption: and figured out how to get it to work in

00:39:46.618 --> 00:39:51.598
Caption: webkit and and Firefox I can&#39;t speculate

00:39:49.858 --> 00:39:55.039
Caption: on that but there could actually be

00:39:51.599 --> 00:39:55.040
Caption: different codes sort of detecting that

00:39:55.339 --> 00:39:59.339
Caption: thank you so much Macklin if everyone

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:03.260
Caption: could just give him another round for

00:39:59.339 --> 00:40:03.260
Caption: pros for that amazing talk

00:40:03.949 --> 00:40:07.149
Caption: [Applause]
