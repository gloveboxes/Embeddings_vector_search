Caption: machine learning you can do a tutorial

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.369

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:32.709
Caption: have a look a common misunderstanding is

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:35.500
Caption: that if we save all the poor children

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:38.500
Caption: the world will become overpopulated

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:42.579
Caption: this may sound logical but it&#39;s wrong

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:45.878

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:48.878

00:06:45.878 --> 00:06:52.329

Caption: children in the next generation

00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:05.859

00:07:03.338 --> 00:07:08.168
Caption: fast among the poorest this is the

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:13.538
Caption: average family in the worst of places

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:15.789

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:18.220
Caption: child mortality is highest

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:21.459
Caption: that&#39;s where population is growing

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.860
Caption: faster than anywhere else how many

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:26.709

Caption: in rural Mexico large cities in Africa

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:04.480
Caption: today in most population children just

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:06.820
Caption: replace parents and the size of

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:10.660
Caption: generations are no longer increasing

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:15.070
Caption: this means the population will stop

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:18.190
Caption: growing how did so many people end up

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:21.399
Caption: with smaller families when their

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:24.220
Caption: children stopped dying as they left

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:27.220

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.860

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.468
Caption: child death by having many babies and a

00:08:29.859 --> 00:08:35.079

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:48.489
Caption: have a small family so by saving the

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:52.179
Caption: lives of poor children and helping the

00:08:48.489 --> 00:08:56.109
Caption: last two billion out of poverty these

00:08:52.179 --> 00:09:05.500
Caption: parents will also decide to have fewer

00:08:56.109 --> 00:09:09.309

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:12.099

00:09:09.309 --> 00:09:15.039
Caption: you and family size forecast up to the

00:09:12.099 --> 00:09:18.029
Caption: end of the century then the world

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:22.509
Caption: population is expected to stop growing

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:25.480
Caption: before it stops another four billion

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:29.799
Caption: people will be added to the world

00:09:25.479 --> 00:09:30.409
Caption: population four billion more that&#39;s a

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:36.229
Caption: lot of

00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:39.979
Caption: people but the longer poor children

00:09:36.229 --> 00:09:46.778
Caption: keeps dying and this change is delayed

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:50.359
Caption: the more billions will be added so

00:09:46.778 --> 00:09:57.349

00:09:50.359 --> 00:10:00.708

Caption: put it into something tangible

00:10:19.388 --> 00:10:24.948
Caption: you need a framework you need to start

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.409
Caption: with a couple of steps where two data

00:10:24.948 --> 00:10:29.448
Caption: scientists so we see every problem as a

00:10:27.409 --> 00:10:32.869
Caption: data problem so we&#39;re gonna propose the

00:10:29.448 --> 00:10:35.049
Caption: data science framework so this is what

00:10:32.869 --> 00:10:38.000
Caption: it looks like you start with an idea

00:10:35.049 --> 00:10:39.888
Caption: something that sounds doesn&#39;t sound

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.679
Caption: right something you care about and you

00:10:39.888 --> 00:10:45.859
Caption: gotta care about a lot because you have

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:49.489
Caption: to put a lot of hours next we need to

00:10:45.859 --> 00:10:51.948
Caption: express it as a hypothesis this is one

00:10:49.489 --> 00:10:54.258
Caption: of the hardest steps take an idea take a

00:10:51.948 --> 00:10:57.198
Caption: feeling and express it in a testable

00:10:54.258 --> 00:10:59.208
Caption: hypothesis next depending on sort of

00:10:57.198 --> 00:11:01.188
Caption: data that you possess and types of

00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:03.948
Caption: questions you want to answer you have

00:11:01.189 --> 00:11:07.730
Caption: three data avenues or we propose 3.11

00:11:03.948 --> 00:11:09.859
Caption: use number one visualization so you can

00:11:07.729 --> 00:11:11.630
Caption: explore it that I understand it and

00:11:09.859 --> 00:11:14.058
Caption: change someone&#39;s mind or provide

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.619
Caption: insights for this one you need I could

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:18.550
Caption: get it data you can get it from the

00:11:15.619 --> 00:11:20.688
Caption: World Bank or UN or Hospital Records

00:11:18.549 --> 00:11:23.688
Caption: just like hands raw Singh and his

00:11:20.689 --> 00:11:27.050
Caption: foundation do next Avenue is simulations

00:11:23.689 --> 00:11:29.149
Caption: the current computer power allows us to

00:11:27.049 --> 00:11:31.909
Caption: simulate multiple predictions or

00:11:29.148 --> 00:11:34.188
Caption: multiple scenarios as they pan out so if

00:11:31.909 --> 00:11:39.469
Caption: you into this sort of stuff you need

00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:41.630
Caption: data based assumptions then we have

00:11:39.469 --> 00:11:43.489
Caption: predictive modeling you can forecast

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.299
Caption: things like for example the spread of a

00:11:43.489 --> 00:11:46.130
Caption: disease

00:11:44.299 --> 00:11:48.830
Caption: for this one you need very particular

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:51.679
Caption: data you need granular data and

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.929
Caption: hopefully labeled okay once you have

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:57.169
Caption: that once you chose your path there&#39;s a

00:11:53.929 --> 00:11:59.359
Caption: lot of hard work and experimentation

00:11:57.169 --> 00:12:01.639
Caption: going in you along the way you learn new

00:11:59.359 --> 00:12:04.459
Caption: skills pick up new tools and what&#39;s the

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:07.369
Caption: reward the reward is that you share

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.679
Caption: community and you have an opinion that

00:12:07.369 --> 00:12:14.169
Caption: is based on something rather than just

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:14.169
Caption: an anecdotal evidence or a media report

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:24.190
Caption: take it away d okay so let&#39;s start with

00:12:18.979 --> 00:12:27.349
Caption: visualizations we have a question if

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:32.479
Caption: 2018 do we produce and consume our food

00:12:27.349 --> 00:12:35.630
Caption: efficiently is food waste a worldwide

00:12:32.479 --> 00:12:39.679
Caption: problem surely has decreased we know

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:41.780
Caption: more about it it&#39;s everywhere well we

00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:44.899
Caption: took data from the Food and Agriculture

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:47.330
Caption: Organization of the UN use toggle public

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.610
Caption: which is a free tool and then plotted

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.770
Caption: some of their numbers what we can see

00:12:49.609 --> 00:12:56.299
Caption: here is that population has been

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:58.429
Caption: increasing slowly we&#39;re almost 8 billion

00:12:56.299 --> 00:13:03.349
Caption: already and waste has been discrete

00:12:58.429 --> 00:13:05.570
Caption: increasing as well as steadily numbers

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:09.649
Caption: so what about if we look at average

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:12.950
Caption: waste per capita it has been increasing

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:16.280
Caption: as well quite steadily and up there what

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:19.250
Caption: we can do is look at countries and their

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.320
Caption: average waste per person this allows us

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.299
Caption: to compare countries with totally

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:27.289
Caption: different populations so let&#39;s say you

00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:30.019
Caption: want to compare China Haiti is it

00:13:27.289 --> 00:13:46.229
Caption: Kazakhstan here yeah where is Bharat

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:49.690
Caption: looking ok what about in Australia so

00:13:46.229 --> 00:13:52.449
Caption: okay okay so in Australia were in a very

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:54.309
Caption: specific situation eighty to ninety

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:57.609
Caption: percent of the food that we consume is

00:13:54.309 --> 00:14:00.789
Caption: produced nationally but a big chunk is

00:13:57.609 --> 00:14:03.250
Caption: not getting to the supermarkets twenty

00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:05.769
Caption: percent gets wasted before it reaches

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:08.770
Caption: the shelves why because we have consumer

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:11.080
Caption: standards we have beauty standards for

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:13.540
Caption: our fruits and veggies we don&#39;t like

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:19.900
Caption: them to be ugly or to brown or too

00:14:13.539 --> 00:14:22.959
Caption: skinny this is the distribution of upon

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:25.180
Caption: royal gala from a supermarket is the

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.190
Caption: pink one and the blue one is what you

00:14:25.179 --> 00:14:29.760
Caption: would expect from nature so it&#39;s totally

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:32.650
Caption: truncated the one from that supermarket

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:36.630
Caption: if we only accepting those kind of

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.630
Caption: eyeballs we don&#39;t want the rest of them

00:14:36.719 --> 00:14:41.199
Caption: what about home we do the grocery

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:46.300
Caption: shopping then we take the food and we

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:50.049
Caption: cook we we are wasting one third of our

00:14:46.299 --> 00:14:52.209
Caption: food at home the Australian government

00:14:50.049 --> 00:14:53.890
Caption: spent a lot of money in a research they

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:56.860
Caption: asked people to go through the Europeans

00:14:53.890 --> 00:15:00.910
Caption: and categorize the waste and what they

00:14:56.859 --> 00:15:04.390
Caption: found was that almost 40% of the food

00:15:00.909 --> 00:15:07.989
Caption: that&#39;s being wasted is fresh food a big

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:10.210
Caption: chunk is well 25 percent leftovers what

00:15:07.989 --> 00:15:12.520
Caption: it is telling us we&#39;re buying too much

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.250
Caption: we&#39;re cooking too much we&#39;re not eating

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.559
Caption: a lot

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:20.950
Caption: so our takeaways if you&#39;re buying more

00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:23.520
Caption: than 10 kilos per person per week you&#39;re

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.520
Caption: buying too much

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:36.159
Caption: sorry okay you go thank you very much

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:38.740
Caption: dear and now I know I can&#39;t really lift

00:15:36.159 --> 00:15:41.969
Caption: 10 kgs over my head oh no I can but I

00:15:38.739 --> 00:15:45.760
Caption: cannot lift my groceries above my head

00:15:41.969 --> 00:15:48.189
Caption: simulations this is a topic that I find

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.710
Caption: absolutely fascinating so there

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:52.330
Caption: Montecarlo situation simulations or

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:55.119
Caption: there are other simulations I

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:58.420
Caption: particularly like agent-based modeling

00:15:55.119 --> 00:16:00.520
Caption: what is it it is a type of modeling that

00:15:58.419 --> 00:16:03.549
Caption: allows you to observe the behavior of

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.890
Caption: the whole system by setting very simple

00:16:03.549 --> 00:16:09.130
Caption: rules of individual agents in this

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:12.359
Caption: simulation the poster child of

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:15.460
Caption: simulation agent-based modeling is

00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:17.559
Caption: Schelling&#39;s segregation model let&#39;s have

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:20.530
Caption: a look at it so this is our agent our

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:24.039
Caption: citizen blue he lives on this checkered

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:27.340
Caption: board he has the sameness threshold he

00:16:24.039 --> 00:16:30.880
Caption: is going to be happy only if at least

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.300
Caption: three neighbors around him ah as blue as

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.520
Caption: he is

00:16:31.299 --> 00:16:36.419
Caption: and these blueness can be anything it

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.190
Caption: could be income level it could be race

00:16:36.419 --> 00:16:41.889
Caption: so there you go that&#39;s his eight

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:44.500
Caption: neighbors and only two of them are the

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:49.570
Caption: same as him his threshold tells him to

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:53.469
Caption: move out when you replicate this simple

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:55.809
Caption: behavior over the majority of agents

00:16:53.469 --> 00:16:58.689
Caption: that populate the same chessboard you

00:16:55.809 --> 00:17:04.420
Caption: see very interesting patterns starting

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:07.359
Caption: to emerge let&#39;s have a look so what I

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:10.119
Caption: did here I set up a pretty tolerable

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:14.770
Caption: threshold for I only want half of my

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:16.959
Caption: neighbors to be like me then I kick off

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:19.989
Caption: the popular the simulation and what we

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:22.599
Caption: see that slowly but surely a pattern

00:17:19.989 --> 00:17:24.910
Caption: becomes to emerge all the Reds go to one

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:27.489
Caption: corner and all the Blues go to another

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:29.830
Caption: corner and below here we see a number of

00:17:27.489 --> 00:17:32.890
Caption: happy agents so once I&#39;m happy I settle

00:17:29.829 --> 00:17:35.709
Caption: down and not only its segregated look at

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:38.560
Caption: the gaps so this shows us how mild

00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:39.669
Caption: individual preferences can result in a

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:45.730
Caption: vast listing

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:47.950
Caption: societies well simulations are great but

00:17:45.729 --> 00:17:50.049
Caption: are they really true like there&#39;s so

00:17:47.949 --> 00:17:51.639
Caption: many reasons why someone might choose to

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:54.730
Caption: move out or move in in a particular

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.440
Caption: neighborhood but the funny thing about

00:17:54.729 --> 00:17:59.169
Caption: this one is that we actually see this in

00:17:56.439 --> 00:18:02.229
Caption: reality so for example this is Melbourne

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:04.480
Caption: and different levels of color here are

00:18:02.229 --> 00:18:06.160
Caption: the income levels so throughout the

00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:09.579
Caption: years they reach a neighborhood and

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:12.720
Caption: they&#39;re not so rich neighborhood and we

00:18:09.579 --> 00:18:19.019
Caption: can see the segregation very clearly

00:18:12.719 --> 00:18:21.520
Caption: this is census map of Chicago blue dots

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.250
Caption: households that identify as black and

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.050
Caption: red is the household that identify as

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:28.390
Caption: white and there are other races

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:30.600
Caption: presented as well but this is the most

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:34.630
Caption: interesting one census map of Detroit

00:18:30.599 --> 00:18:35.589
Caption: 2010 do you see that clear separation

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.290
Caption: line over there

00:18:35.589 --> 00:18:45.130
Caption: Eminem fans in the room do you know what

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:47.680
Caption: it is it is the famous 8 Mile Road ok so

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:50.410
Caption: I thought how can I put this to work

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:53.220
Caption: there is one thing that really really

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:55.359
Caption: doesn&#39;t sound right to me and this is

00:18:53.219 --> 00:18:57.609
Caption: sensitive topic everyone has their own

00:18:55.359 --> 00:19:00.549
Caption: opinion but this is what doesn&#39;t sound

00:18:57.609 --> 00:19:04.390
Caption: right to me why there are people who not

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:06.850
Caption: welcome refugees out of fear that they

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:10.599
Caption: will somehow instill their culture and

00:19:06.849 --> 00:19:13.390
Caption: turn our country into their country

00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:15.819
Caption: that&#39;s all right here sometimes ok this

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:19.209
Caption: is a grand idea but how do you express

00:19:15.819 --> 00:19:21.909
Caption: it as a hypothesis so with agent-based

00:19:19.209 --> 00:19:25.859
Caption: modeling what fraction of agents of

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:28.900
Caption: guest culture can a host nation absorb

00:19:25.859 --> 00:19:32.679
Caption: without turning into the guest culture

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:36.430
Caption: and I need some assumptions to make this

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:40.180
Caption: simulation work so here&#39;s our hosts and

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:43.210
Caption: guests and first assumption is

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:46.990
Caption: assimilation rate so we know that the

00:19:43.209 --> 00:19:49.299
Caption: more integrated is refugee the more

00:19:46.989 --> 00:19:51.160
Caption: assimilated they become the faster they

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:53.770
Caption: learned language the faster they will

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.599
Caption: embrace local culture

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:57.880
Caption: so overtime you&#39;ve given enough

00:19:55.599 --> 00:20:02.520
Caption: neighbors of host culture around them

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:06.390
Caption: they turn into one of the host culture

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:13.150
Caption: agency another assumption is replica

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:14.950
Caption: recreation rate so agents see enough see

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.479
Caption: a suitable candidate around them and

00:20:14.949 --> 00:20:18.189
Caption: they get married and they have children

00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:20.229
Caption: you see my games didn&#39;t change for the

00:20:18.189 --> 00:20:24.699
Caption: last thirty years so this can be a lot

00:20:20.229 --> 00:20:27.369
Caption: of fun next while I was working on this

00:20:24.699 --> 00:20:29.349
Caption: I dispelled my own myths so I find I

00:20:27.369 --> 00:20:32.290
Caption: think this is success already I was

00:20:29.349 --> 00:20:34.660
Caption: trying so hard to find some data that

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:37.390
Caption: shows different procreation rates for

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:39.849
Caption: different cultures of course they just

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:41.890
Caption: check just age and some abstracts but

00:20:39.849 --> 00:20:44.410
Caption: what was on my mind is Syrian refugee

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:45.940
Caption: crisis and the Western world so yeah

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.260
Caption: well we all know it&#39;s kind of common

00:20:45.939 --> 00:20:49.839
Caption: sense they have bigger families I

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:53.500
Caption: couldn&#39;t find anything there is no such

00:20:49.839 --> 00:20:55.479
Caption: data as Hans Rosling already told us in

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.880
Caption: the beginning it has nothing to do with

00:20:55.479 --> 00:20:59.949
Caption: religion or culture it has everything to

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:03.369
Caption: do with income level so the moment

00:20:59.949 --> 00:21:07.329
Caption: family grows out of extreme poverty they

00:21:03.369 --> 00:21:10.589
Caption: decide to have less children so these

00:21:07.329 --> 00:21:13.380
Caption: are my assumptions how do i model this i

00:21:10.589 --> 00:21:16.419
Caption: model is based on already existing

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:18.969
Caption: algorithm such as shelling segregation

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.859
Caption: model and wolf ship predation and I use

00:21:18.969 --> 00:21:24.039
Caption: Meza price and framework because I want

00:21:20.859 --> 00:21:27.489
Caption: to learn a bit about Python and get

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:29.950
Caption: better this programming language so I

00:21:27.489 --> 00:21:33.099
Caption: want to show you one scenario and how it

00:21:29.949 --> 00:21:36.279
Caption: pans out I set it to 243 which is

00:21:33.099 --> 00:21:39.160
Caption: roughly about Australian population site

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:41.559
Caption: 24 million and then I said number of

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.869
Caption: guests to 73 say seven million seven

00:21:41.558 --> 00:21:46.599
Caption: minutes huge number then I simulate this

00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:50.500
Caption: and you see agents moving around getting

00:21:46.599 --> 00:21:52.449
Caption: married having children and then with

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:56.199
Caption: this particular scenario I can see that

00:21:52.449 --> 00:21:59.439
Caption: the population is in balance well I&#39;m

00:21:56.199 --> 00:22:02.829
Caption: not going to defend a PhD thesis with

00:21:59.439 --> 00:22:04.239
Caption: this just yet so what is the action

00:22:02.829 --> 00:22:06.909
Caption: point what&#39;s the point of all this room

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:07.459
Caption: one well the point for me is to be an

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.679
Caption: advocate

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:11.719
Caption: it next time I have a kitchen

00:22:09.678 --> 00:22:14.058
Caption: conversation with someone of a

00:22:11.719 --> 00:22:16.520
Caption: completely different view I will have

00:22:14.058 --> 00:22:20.119
Caption: not find my belly I will have an opinion

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:21.890
Caption: that I can defend and will change the

00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:25.130
Caption: world one kitchen conversation one

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:27.020
Caption: person at the time thank you

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.909
Caption: so let&#39;s move to machine learning

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.190
Caption: machine learning is changing the world

00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:32.779
Caption: but what is it is the ability for

00:22:31.189 --> 00:22:38.449
Caption: computers to learn without being

00:22:32.779 --> 00:22:42.080
Caption: explicitly programmed interesting so

00:22:38.449 --> 00:22:44.569
Caption: this is an idea firm that&#39;s taxpayers

00:22:42.079 --> 00:22:47.058
Caption: money around the world go to welfare

00:22:44.569 --> 00:22:49.069
Caption: programs right but how do we know that

00:22:47.058 --> 00:22:53.750
Caption: those who need it the most are getting

00:22:49.069 --> 00:22:56.989
Caption: it how do you know if a household is

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:58.939
Caption: poor you&#39;ll say well you just asked them

00:22:56.989 --> 00:23:01.699
Caption: to complete a form look at the tax

00:22:58.939 --> 00:23:04.398
Caption: returns well this is not a possibility

00:23:01.699 --> 00:23:06.079
Caption: in a lot of developing countries they

00:23:04.399 --> 00:23:07.659
Caption: don&#39;t have the infrastructure there are

00:23:06.079 --> 00:23:12.250
Caption: problems like corruption

00:23:07.659 --> 00:23:17.120
Caption: for example the Costa Rican government

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:19.250
Caption: wants to take all the power of machine

00:23:17.119 --> 00:23:22.760
Caption: learning to be able to correctly

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:25.010
Caption: classify houses for are they extremely

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.829
Caption: poor do they need a system or they do

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:29.630
Caption: not need assistance they have also

00:23:27.829 --> 00:23:31.219
Caption: engaged the community they have asked

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.959
Caption: people like you that want to use data

00:23:31.219 --> 00:23:36.319
Caption: science for good to help them be to

00:23:32.959 --> 00:23:39.949
Caption: build the model so why are they asking

00:23:36.319 --> 00:23:42.259
Caption: for we have a hundred and forty two

00:23:39.949 --> 00:23:43.969
Caption: features of a house so someone has gone

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.779
Caption: there to the house look at everything

00:23:43.969 --> 00:23:50.928
Caption: and then they have labeled them as

00:23:46.779 --> 00:23:52.850
Caption: extremely poor North the features are

00:23:50.928 --> 00:23:55.729
Caption: like for example piso de madera do they

00:23:52.849 --> 00:23:57.798
Caption: have wooden floors or heavy or HEPA is

00:23:55.729 --> 00:24:02.209
Caption: the main provider male or female

00:23:57.798 --> 00:24:05.569
Caption: computer or no computer a computer once

00:24:02.209 --> 00:24:08.239
Caption: we have all of those features then the

00:24:05.569 --> 00:24:10.428
Caption: next time they get an application for

00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:12.678
Caption: assistance someone doesn&#39;t have to go

00:24:10.428 --> 00:24:14.298
Caption: there and look at the house the computer

00:24:12.678 --> 00:24:17.199
Caption: will tell you the model will say yes

00:24:14.298 --> 00:24:19.819
Caption: they do need assistance or no they told

00:24:17.199 --> 00:24:21.380
Caption: so that that sounds really interesting

00:24:19.819 --> 00:24:27.109
Caption: this is something I want to get into

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:29.329
Caption: but we also cheated here we did not know

00:24:27.109 --> 00:24:31.790
Caption: I didn&#39;t want to go through data

00:24:29.329 --> 00:24:34.279
Caption: collection and data cleaning problem so

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:37.400
Caption: we joined a competition on cargo this is

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:39.710
Caption: a platform because you know what we

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.619
Caption: saved ourselves about 80 percent of time

00:24:39.709 --> 00:24:46.729
Caption: like that there is not so sexy side of

00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:50.689
Caption: data science about 80 percent of time we

00:24:46.729 --> 00:24:53.449
Caption: spend cleaning gating data creating

00:24:50.689 --> 00:24:57.529
Caption: features polishing than looking for

00:24:53.449 --> 00:25:00.889
Caption: leakages and only then in a 20% of time

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:02.750
Caption: that remains we can apply ml machine

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:05.540
Caption: learning magic and machine learning is

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:07.790
Caption: no magic one of the biggest aha moments

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.560
Caption: for me when I just started I&#39;m still a

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:13.460
Caption: beginner but one of the biggest aha

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:17.210
Caption: moments was is that machine learning is

00:25:13.459 --> 00:25:19.969
Caption: no magic if the one of the one of the

00:25:17.209 --> 00:25:21.739
Caption: best indicators of the quality of your

00:25:19.969 --> 00:25:24.739
Caption: machine learning prediction is human

00:25:21.739 --> 00:25:28.670
Caption: expert given enough time and a quiet

00:25:24.739 --> 00:25:31.309
Caption: room and enough data if they start to

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:32.810
Caption: see the signal in the data if they with

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.430
Caption: the domain knowledge start to understand

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.590
Caption: what&#39;s about to happen then there&#39;s a

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:39.770
Caption: hope that machine learning algorithm can

00:25:36.589 --> 00:25:42.349
Caption: also pick up the signal in this noise

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:45.619
Caption: what was your ha moment II know answer

00:25:42.349 --> 00:25:47.059
Caption: moment is rubbish in rubbish out if you

00:25:45.619 --> 00:25:48.439
Caption: have no idea where you get into the

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.990
Caption: model you have no idea what you&#39;re

00:25:48.439 --> 00:25:53.869
Caption: getting so get close to your data get

00:25:50.989 --> 00:25:57.050
Caption: personal no it doesn&#39;t have missing

00:25:53.869 --> 00:25:59.869
Caption: values why does he have correlations do

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:01.520
Caption: we need to transform the data then you

00:25:59.869 --> 00:26:04.699
Caption: will be able to do a really good model

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.440
Caption: you can plot it it will tell you how the

00:26:04.699 --> 00:26:08.539
Caption: distributions look they have

00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:11.179
Caption: correlations do you need some feature

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:12.460
Caption: engineering for example we can see there

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.630
Caption: is a strong correlation between

00:26:12.459 --> 00:26:15.949
Caption: overcrowding and the house size not a

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:19.069
Caption: surprise but it could give you some

00:26:15.949 --> 00:26:20.119
Caption: clues or way to start and now that I

00:26:19.069 --> 00:26:23.209
Caption: know my data

00:26:20.119 --> 00:26:24.790
Caption: there were best buddies then you can

00:26:23.209 --> 00:26:27.260
Caption: apply the model

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:29.239
Caption: alright and there are many ways on

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:31.310
Caption: algorithm to go search for this signal

00:26:29.239 --> 00:26:33.739
Caption: in your data there mind maps like this

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.669
Caption: one from scikit-learn that exist where

00:26:33.739 --> 00:26:36.469
Caption: you can just

00:26:34.668 --> 00:26:38.689
Caption: based on the type of question you trying

00:26:36.469 --> 00:26:40.969
Caption: to answer based on the value you trying

00:26:38.689 --> 00:26:43.069
Caption: to predict and based on the number of

00:26:40.969 --> 00:26:44.928
Caption: observation you possess you can choose

00:26:43.069 --> 00:26:49.118
Caption: an algorithm to start at least a

00:26:44.928 --> 00:26:52.099
Caption: starting point and here is one catch

00:26:49.119 --> 00:26:55.489
Caption: I&#39;m ready to save the world I made

00:26:52.099 --> 00:26:57.469
Caption: myself some tea I sit down I can&#39;t even

00:26:55.489 --> 00:27:01.009
Caption: install the library like this is a

00:26:57.469 --> 00:27:04.099
Caption: massive turnoff how we need a lowest

00:27:01.009 --> 00:27:06.979
Caption: point of entry as low as we can so for

00:27:04.099 --> 00:27:08.509
Caption: this I thought out of my personal

00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:10.939
Caption: experience there&#39;s one tool that I

00:27:08.509 --> 00:27:13.309
Caption: particularly like it&#39;s so visual it&#39;s

00:27:10.939 --> 00:27:14.719
Caption: gonna with your interest it will it&#39;s a

00:27:13.308 --> 00:27:17.359
Caption: cheese it will show you what&#39;s possible

00:27:14.719 --> 00:27:20.329
Caption: and then you can get get back to the

00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:22.070
Caption: real tools Python dinar and make the job

00:27:20.329 --> 00:27:25.939
Caption: done but let&#39;s have a look at this

00:27:22.069 --> 00:27:29.408
Caption: cheese a tool it&#39;s called big amount big

00:27:25.939 --> 00:27:32.388
Caption: machine learning they&#39;re they&#39;re free

00:27:29.409 --> 00:27:34.789
Caption: versions available but let&#39;s just have a

00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:37.580
Caption: quick look we have about 10 minutes left

00:27:34.788 --> 00:27:42.108
Caption: our talk so this is me I upload our

00:27:37.579 --> 00:27:43.969
Caption: Costa Rica train and the test set so the

00:27:42.109 --> 00:27:47.509
Caption: ID in data science you take your data

00:27:43.969 --> 00:27:49.219
Caption: then you split it usually 820 don&#39;t you

00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:52.009
Caption: train you algorithm on the 80 and you

00:27:49.219 --> 00:27:55.219
Caption: use the rest to check the results well

00:27:52.009 --> 00:27:58.369
Caption: this is all done in one click here next

00:27:55.219 --> 00:28:02.298
Caption: I can go and I click on a model that I

00:27:58.369 --> 00:28:04.779
Caption: want to build again so for example for

00:28:02.298 --> 00:28:07.939
Caption: this one average build random forests

00:28:04.779 --> 00:28:10.700
Caption: random forest decision tree neural net

00:28:07.939 --> 00:28:12.918
Caption: and some proprietary algorithm that they

00:28:10.699 --> 00:28:15.969
Caption: possess so how about we have a look at

00:28:12.918 --> 00:28:15.969
Caption: one of the models

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:26.560
Caption: because it&#39;s a classification problem

00:28:22.479 --> 00:28:29.169
Caption: and what this algorithm is trying to do

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.900
Caption: is to make a decision based on multiple

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:33.730
Caption: features what target should we assign to

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.109
Caption: this household we can see it straight

00:28:33.729 --> 00:28:37.660
Caption: away that some features are more

00:28:35.109 --> 00:28:39.760
Caption: important than others hogar Nino

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:44.349
Caption: that&#39;s number of children but as we know

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:48.550
Caption: the relationship between relationship

00:28:44.349 --> 00:28:51.160
Caption: with reason and the outcome is not it&#39;s

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:53.590
Caption: not like that it&#39;s not because they have

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:58.180
Caption: more children household is poor it&#39;s

00:28:53.589 --> 00:29:00.339
Caption: quite the other way around and once we

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:04.510
Caption: have this decision tree we can evaluate

00:29:00.339 --> 00:29:08.640
Caption: the model this is the part when I took

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:13.380
Caption: the rest of the data the 20% unseen and

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:15.910
Caption: I come up our algorithm comes up with a

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:18.280
Caption: with the labels and then we just simply

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.050
Caption: compare them to what we already see in

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.390
Caption: the data

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:24.670
Caption: so in this like I just like how it shows

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:27.849
Caption: you in a very visual way the confusion

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:29.859
Caption: matrix the false positives that the true

00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:33.069
Caption: positives the false negatives this

00:29:29.859 --> 00:29:34.660
Caption: becomes much easier to understand and it

00:29:33.069 --> 00:29:37.029
Caption: gives you idea what you should be even

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:39.580
Caption: looking for so for example for this

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:42.910
Caption: particular problem we probably don&#39;t

00:29:39.579 --> 00:29:45.099
Caption: want to miss those household that really

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:48.340
Caption: really need help so those with label one

00:29:45.099 --> 00:29:50.289
Caption: right so it&#39;s okay if we miss label some

00:29:48.339 --> 00:29:52.510
Caption: of the other households and as those

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:55.540
Caption: that need assistance but we don&#39;t want

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:58.869
Caption: to miss those so this means that we need

00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:04.210
Caption: a high recall algorithm and lower

00:29:58.869 --> 00:30:08.050
Caption: precision next once the algorithm is

00:30:04.209 --> 00:30:13.449
Caption: prepared we can go ahead and even come

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:18.610
Caption: up and even test it so say I&#39;m a Costa

00:30:13.449 --> 00:30:24.149
Caption: Rica government official and what I want

00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:24.150
Caption: to do this is my

00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:35.289
Caption: yeah and then I can set an unseen a new

00:30:32.859 --> 00:30:37.058
Caption: application comes in I set up the

00:30:35.288 --> 00:30:39.158
Caption: outcome how many children do they have

00:30:37.058 --> 00:30:41.709
Caption: do they have my valve on what&#39;s the

00:30:39.159 --> 00:30:43.990
Caption: education level and obviously I

00:30:41.709 --> 00:30:46.268
Caption: understand the Spanish so I would be

00:30:43.989 --> 00:30:50.739
Caption: much more fish than this and it will

00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:53.889
Caption: give me with with a probability of 56%

00:30:50.739 --> 00:30:57.038
Caption: and outcome this is a house of the label

00:30:53.889 --> 00:31:02.529
Caption: too so that&#39;s not support moderate

00:30:57.038 --> 00:31:05.109
Caption: poverty so once you have an idea of how

00:31:02.529 --> 00:31:09.100
Caption: this works and what to look for you can

00:31:05.109 --> 00:31:11.648
Caption: go back to the Orthodox all tools like

00:31:09.099 --> 00:31:14.408
Caption: Python LR and create your own machine

00:31:11.649 --> 00:31:16.600
Caption: learning algorithm and this is what we

00:31:14.409 --> 00:31:18.580
Caption: do with it yes so we have made a

00:31:16.599 --> 00:31:22.239
Caption: submission in Catalan we&#39;re competing on

00:31:18.579 --> 00:31:24.008
Caption: this lowly climbing the ladder and the

00:31:22.239 --> 00:31:26.019
Caption: cattle for those of you who don&#39;t know

00:31:24.009 --> 00:31:28.629
Caption: it&#39;s a data science competition it&#39;s a

00:31:26.019 --> 00:31:32.080
Caption: worldwide competition where governments

00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:34.389
Caption: and other organizations set out a

00:31:32.079 --> 00:31:36.128
Caption: problem for community to solve we

00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:37.690
Caption: encourage you if you want to get into a

00:31:36.129 --> 00:31:38.979
Caption: machine learning or the other science

00:31:37.689 --> 00:31:42.038
Caption: join one of them

00:31:38.979 --> 00:31:43.439
Caption: Cargill driven data there&#39;s two

00:31:42.038 --> 00:31:49.808
Caption: platforms that have a lot of

00:31:43.439 --> 00:31:51.998
Caption: competitions for social good well so

00:31:49.808 --> 00:31:55.089
Caption: what we tried there are 15 global

00:31:51.999 --> 00:31:57.309
Caption: challenges so with visualization we try

00:31:55.089 --> 00:31:59.109
Caption: to have a stab at this one how can

00:31:57.308 --> 00:32:01.689
Caption: population growth and resources be

00:31:59.109 --> 00:32:04.689
Caption: brought into balance with simulations we

00:32:01.689 --> 00:32:07.658
Caption: try to have a go at this one how can

00:32:04.689 --> 00:32:10.748
Caption: shared values reduce ethnic conflicts

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:13.690
Caption: and terrorism and finally with the

00:32:10.749 --> 00:32:15.609
Caption: predictive modeling we try to answer

00:32:13.689 --> 00:32:17.408
Caption: this question how can a thecal market

00:32:15.609 --> 00:32:21.158
Caption: economies be encouraged to help reduce

00:32:17.409 --> 00:32:23.619
Caption: the gap between rich and poor and now

00:32:21.159 --> 00:32:27.700
Caption: it&#39;s back to you ladies and gentlemen

00:32:23.619 --> 00:32:31.049
Caption: what really inspires you what what keeps

00:32:27.699 --> 00:32:35.229
Caption: you awake at night which one of those

00:32:31.048 --> 00:32:37.359
Caption: problems you will find interesting

00:32:35.229 --> 00:32:40.349
Caption: enough and inspiring enough to spend

00:32:37.359 --> 00:32:40.349
Caption: your weekends on

00:32:41.369 --> 00:32:46.930
Caption: we have made a github page so you can go

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:49.479
Caption: and see there&#39;s links to the tutorials

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:51.700
Caption: to competitions to examples an

00:32:49.479 --> 00:32:53.380
Caption: explanation of the challenges if you&#39;re

00:32:51.699 --> 00:32:56.949
Caption: interested there&#39;s a lot of resources

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:59.589
Caption: you can go and look for and another

00:32:56.949 --> 00:33:01.739
Caption: teaser for you because we did got in

00:32:59.589 --> 00:33:05.949
Caption: touch with the founders of millennium

00:33:01.739 --> 00:33:08.589
Caption: foundation and also UN they are thinking

00:33:05.949 --> 00:33:12.309
Caption: of organizing a hackathon in Perth next

00:33:08.589 --> 00:33:14.349
Caption: year and will help to make it happen so

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:16.270
Caption: hopefully if you feel inspired or this

00:33:14.349 --> 00:33:17.739
Caption: is some some thought that&#39;s gonna be

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:21.250
Caption: buzzing on the back of your mind

00:33:17.739 --> 00:33:22.000
Caption: from now until 2019 hopefully we&#39;ll see

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:24.280
Caption: you there

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:32.910
Caption: thank you very much thank you
