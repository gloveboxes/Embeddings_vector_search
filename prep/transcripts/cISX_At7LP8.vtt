Caption: projects as well trying to make oversaw

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.260
Caption: sustainable so I think yeah there&#39;s

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:19.540
Caption: definitely the massive backlash from

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:27.429
Caption: just expectations so it&#39;s repeats come

00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:27.429
Caption: we have time for Wars limit or topic

00:16:31.849 --> 00:16:35.630
Caption: [Laughter]

00:16:44.510 --> 00:17:17.089
Caption: but we are our codes let me see just

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:26.450
Caption: used like the defaults oh no just like

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:39.770
Caption: anyway so how it&#39;s cooked

00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:39.769
Caption: there&#39;s nothing actually

00:17:42.189 --> 00:17:47.250
Caption: for my debts to turn around and so we

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:53.430
Caption: need to think the screen

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:53.430
Caption: release sorry I will agree with effect

00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:57.779
Caption: delivery that is

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.140
Caption: [Laughter]

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:30.339
Caption: I&#39;d actually disagree with that I&#39;d say

00:18:28.359 --> 00:18:32.979
Caption: that it would have been up to be

00:18:30.339 --> 00:18:40.359
Caption: experienced designer to tell them that

00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:41.739
Caption: nation apart those guns of the users you

00:18:40.359 --> 00:18:53.619
Caption: know the people that actually use the

00:18:41.739 --> 00:18:59.619
Caption: system which goes back to add it&#39;s

00:18:53.619 --> 00:19:01.979
Caption: someone else&#39;s honing just somebody

00:18:59.619 --> 00:19:01.979
Caption: else&#39;s

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:17.210
Caption: what happens if a release is zero cost

00:19:14.569 --> 00:19:18.459
Caption: or approximate it&#39;s zero cost is that a

00:19:17.209 --> 00:19:21.319
Caption: problem

00:19:18.459 --> 00:19:23.748
Caption: what happens if the hard-coded values

00:19:21.319 --> 00:19:26.298
Caption: are at what I would call like the root

00:19:23.749 --> 00:19:31.489
Caption: or the entry point of the application so

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:32.988
Caption: set point so they&#39;re all they&#39;re all

00:19:31.489 --> 00:19:41.139
Caption: hard-coded but they&#39;re all right there

00:19:32.989 --> 00:19:41.139
Caption: as I ground speed 30.9 and release

00:19:53.569 --> 00:20:29.928
Caption: so yeah you&#39;re right when I was right

00:20:27.199 --> 00:20:37.579
Caption: right or just by a medium right they get

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:55.878
Caption: the boys we never said this was going to

00:20:37.579 --> 00:20:59.329
Caption: be favored move on to round 2 so this is

00:20:55.879 --> 00:21:01.580

Caption: product you might either really love it

00:21:01.579 --> 00:21:07.699

Caption: outside to challenge and often someone

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:04.040
