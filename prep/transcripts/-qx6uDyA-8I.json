  "description": "Writing tests is one of the best ways to build confidence in releasing our software. It\u0027s so useful that many people advocate for test-driven development (TDD) where you write the tests before writing any code. So why would I suggest not writing tests at all?\\n\\nThe tests we write now aren\u0027t good enough -- we miss things or make mistakes, so for the same reason we\u0027ve automated so many other processes, it\u0027s better to let a computer do it. In this talk we will go over some ways to use formal methods like finite state machines that allow tests to be generated, rather than hand-written and how that will save you time and result in better tests and more confidence in your releases.\\n\\n--\\nBen is a consultant at Telstra Purple, where he helps teams solve their business problems. He is interested in all aspects of web development, and how we can learn from other industries to build better software. He has presented on various topics, from TypeScript to reactive programming to web authentication."
