Caption: um I&#39;ve got a really long bio Jamie

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:11.399
Caption: Butler is a lead consultant at Telstra

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:15.079
Caption: purple that&#39;s all you get

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:15.079
Caption: without further Ado here&#39;s Jamie

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.180
Caption: all right just make sure you can hear me

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.500
Caption: fantastic I think you can because I can

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.880
Caption: hear me

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.618
Caption: um welcome welcome thank you for coming

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.959
Caption: to my talk lessons from the video game

00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:29.778
Caption: industry I am Jamie Butler the

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:32.939
Caption: consultant at purple as you just heard

00:00:29.778 --> 00:00:34.738
Caption: what does that mean it means I&#39;m quite a

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:37.019
Caption: generalist so Consulting I&#39;m on

00:00:34.738 --> 00:00:39.119
Caption: different gigs every three six months

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.159
Caption: and that&#39;s different Tech Stacks that&#39;s

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:42.540
Caption: different corporate environments that&#39;s

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.939
Caption: different this that and the other thing

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.559
Caption: and within that space I do all sorts as

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:50.398
Caption: well do Agile coaching discovering

00:00:48.558 --> 00:00:53.639
Caption: requirements building the actual

00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:54.718
Caption: software testing deploying Ops just a

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:57.299
Caption: little bit of everything so the point

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.199
Caption: that I&#39;m making there is I&#39;m a

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:03.018
Caption: generalist but I also love video games

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.939
Caption: uh and so I wanted to talk to you about

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.119
Caption: GDC the game developer conference housed

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.799
Caption: in San Francisco yearly

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.139
Caption: and I think I hit on this one because I

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.140
Caption: love video games and two because I&#39;m

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:18.180
Caption: such a generalist and and there is just

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:21.000
Caption: so much going on with these conferences

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.919
Caption: people are delivering lessons on

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.599
Caption: leadership they&#39;re delivering lessons on

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:28.019
Caption: building a business from scratch they&#39;re

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:29.699
Caption: develop delivering lessons on cool ux

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:31.258
Caption: development techniques and software

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:32.399
Caption: development techniques so there&#39;s a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.979
Caption: little bit of something there for

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.639
Caption: everybody and for a general generalist

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:41.279
Caption: like me there&#39;s tons for me to consume

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:43.699
Caption: so the goal here is really just to

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:46.739
Caption: illuminate you to the

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:48.360
Caption: high high value of this resource get you

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:50.398
Caption: consuming it and the way I&#39;m going to do

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.619
Caption: that is just share with you a handful of

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.100
Caption: lessons that I personally learned just

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.159
Caption: from watching these GDC conference talks

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:04.078
Caption: um and yeah and see what we discover so

00:01:59.158 --> 00:02:06.118
Caption: first off we have cursed problems the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.759
Caption: idea of a cursed problem is something

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.979
Caption: that Alex Jack from Riot games kind of

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.619
Caption: put together over the last few years and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.139
Caption: he gave a talk about it it&#39;s the idea of

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:17.699
Caption: your in a product development setting or

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.958
Caption: he thinks of it as a game development

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.878
Caption: setting but really it&#39;s a product

00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.860
Caption: development setting where you&#39;ve hit a

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:25.080
Caption: design problem you literally can&#39;t solve

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.180
Caption: and what you really need to do is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.819
Caption: identify that it is an unsolvable

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:33.079
Caption: problem as early as you possibly can so

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.639
Caption: you don&#39;t drag your team of 10 1500

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.619
Caption: people in your company along for the

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:41.819
Caption: ride

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:44.518
Caption: so curse problem as he puts it is a core

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.098
Caption: conflict between the promises of your

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:50.039
Caption: product and it&#39;s important to note here

00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:51.779
Caption: that the promises might be intended or

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.939
Caption: explicit like this is what I built my

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:57.119
Caption: product to do that&#39;s the point of it or

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.339
Caption: they might be derived by your users your

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:01.679
Caption: users might get your hand their hands on

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:03.660
Caption: your product and go oh this is what this

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:06.419
Caption: product is for not actually what you

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.878
Caption: intended for it to be and if those but

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.738
Caption: come into conflict with each other then

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:12.238
Caption: you cannot proceed with the design that

00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:15.300
Caption: you&#39;ve got you need a pretty

00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:16.800
Caption: fundamentally changed the design

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.419
Caption: um and while I won&#39;t go into it Alex

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.878
Caption: provides a whole bunch of techniques for

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.559
Caption: identifying these curse problems and for

00:03:20.878 --> 00:03:24.119
Caption: offering ways to you know make those

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.940
Caption: fundamental shifts that you need to make

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:28.679
Caption: if you end up in that situation and the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.479
Caption: example of a curse problem that he gives

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:33.179
Caption: I give several but the one that I really

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:35.759
Caption: liked is you can see tucked away there

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:39.719
Caption: um if you&#39;re familiar with Diablo 3 at

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:43.679
Caption: all the Diablo 3 option house so Diablo

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.180
Caption: 3 is a looter game you use cool spells

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.639
Caption: or swinging ax and kill a whole bunch of

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:49.139
Caption: enemies and you get cool Loot and every

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.518
Caption: time you do you&#39;re like what&#39;d I just

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.958
Caption: get you know is it better than what I

00:03:50.518 --> 00:03:55.378
Caption: have before is it really awesome

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:57.779
Caption: legendary is it amazing and they added

00:03:55.378 --> 00:03:58.679
Caption: this idea of an auction house where you

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:01.080
Caption: can

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:03.779
Caption: sell the loot that you&#39;ve got and by

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.639
Caption: loot that you really want and what

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:07.619
Caption: happens there is you get this conflict

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.559
Caption: of the whole kind of core premise of

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:11.699
Caption: your game in one aspect it&#39;s a looter

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:13.080
Caption: and you should be looking forward to

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.938
Caption: that moment of finding the cool thing

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.559
Caption: that you really want be able to add an

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:19.380
Caption: auction house suddenly it&#39;s just

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:21.238
Caption: everything that I get is just something

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.679
Caption: I&#39;m going to sell so I can save up and

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.139
Caption: buy the thing I really want and those

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:27.299
Caption: are fundamentally

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.820
Caption: contradictory experiences and the

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:31.198
Caption: solution for Diablo 3 once they realize

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.759
Caption: that they are in this position was to

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.679
Caption: just kill it they got rid of the auction

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.940
Caption: house because they they wanted to keep

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:41.160
Caption: was that core looter experience

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.600
Caption: and my example when I think can try and

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.820
Caption: translate it more to what I do in

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.119
Caption: product development I had to think about

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.100
Caption: um Tumblr So Tumblr was originally built

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:51.600
Caption: as like a blogging platform a really

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.339
Caption: simple blotting blogging platform

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.899
Caption: signing with an email suddenly you&#39;ve

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:55.919
Caption: got a blogging platform it&#39;s really easy

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:58.679
Caption: to use

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.419
Caption: but what the implied promise seemed to

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:02.519
Caption: be from the user&#39;s perspective there&#39;s a

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.419
Caption: cool debating platform where they can

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:08.220
Caption: debate the fundamentals of society and

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.440
Caption: those two things are not the same one is

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.000
Caption: all about broadcasting your opinions and

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.820
Caption: one is about having a healthy back and

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.399
Caption: forth with somebody else and or in an

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.259
Caption: open forum and the way that Tumblr dealt

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:21.059
Caption: with that was just to kind of go oh well

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.799
Caption: this is really taking off we&#39;re going to

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:24.959
Caption: focus on this we&#39;re going to focus on

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:27.599
Caption: this back and forth and chaining blog

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:30.479
Caption: posts onto each other to create kind of

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.240
Caption: uh chained argument not like just a

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.979
Caption: blogging platform so there are multiple

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:38.579
Caption: different ways to solve a curse problem

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:41.279
Caption: but that&#39;s the way that Tumblr took

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:43.918
Caption: so next so that that&#39;s kind of a bit of

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:46.019
Caption: a design lesson that we can learn

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.320
Caption: um moving over a little bit to the tech

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:52.799
Caption: side we have uh we went from curses to

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.179
Caption: cursing weather are your tests by Kevin

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:59.039
Caption: Dill of cathera AI uh this guy works on

00:05:56.179 --> 00:06:01.500
Caption: traversal program uh traversal AI so

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.320
Caption: Bots moving around a world like think

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.880
Caption: cyberpunk 2077 and all the people moving

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.699
Caption: around in it

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.800
Caption: um and this talk was pretty much just a

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.500
Caption: straight up evangelizing of unit tests

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:15.000
Caption: uh mentality and testing mentality which

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.799
Caption: apparently the game industry is not very

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.359
Caption: maturing they don&#39;t you know feel the

00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:20.459
Caption: need to write automated tests all the

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:23.099
Caption: time so it&#39;s pretty straightforward in

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:25.259
Caption: that regard but the Nugget lesson that I

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.759
Caption: pulled out of this one was

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.799
Caption: um when Kevin started talking about

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:31.619
Caption: tests that they have to write that are

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:35.039
Caption: just going to take like 30 seconds or 45

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:36.600
Caption: seconds to run and those are kind of

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.000
Caption: annoying right they bloat your test

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.020
Caption: Suites runtime horrifically especially

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.279
Caption: you know if you&#39;re going to write one

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:43.739
Caption: test really what you&#39;re going to do is

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:45.660
Caption: write like a permutation of that test

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:46.918
Caption: 700 eight different versions of that

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.519
Caption: test and suddenly

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:52.380
Caption: just in one set of tests you&#39;ve got a

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:53.779
Caption: four minute test Suite running and

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.520
Caption: that&#39;s kind of yuck

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:58.739
Caption: so the Nugget that I got from him is to

00:06:56.519 --> 00:07:01.399
Caption: just tag those and many different

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:03.779
Caption: testing libraries like jest and

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:05.940
Caption: unit and C sharp and what have you we&#39;ll

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:08.279
Caption: let you tag your tests and just only run

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.299
Caption: those slow tests overnight don&#39;t run

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:11.279
Caption: them when you&#39;re doing your regular

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:14.459
Caption: building when you&#39;re doing your mergers

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:17.220
Caption: into master or what have you run them

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:19.039
Caption: overnight or just before deployment to

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.239
Caption: production whichever comes first

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.459
Caption: and that way you will come in in the

00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:24.899
Caption: morning all that really slow testing is

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:26.880
Caption: done you can spot a problem if it&#39;s

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:29.039
Caption: there and deal with it and you get the

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.959
Caption: value of those slow tests which might be

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:32.339
Caption: they might need to be slow because

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:34.440
Caption: you&#39;re testing something that should

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:36.179
Caption: take a long time or they might just be

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.639
Caption: slow because you know it&#39;s a really

00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:41.098
Caption: meaty process that you test it but yeah

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:42.740
Caption: a little uh Tech a bit of wisdom that I

00:07:41.098 --> 00:07:46.019
Caption: got from that

00:07:42.739 --> 00:07:47.819
Caption: uh next up we have something more along

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:49.079
Caption: the design lines so

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:50.160
Caption: this is going to be a common theme

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:51.720
Caption: you&#39;re going to keep hearing me say

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.919
Caption: there are lessons coming from every

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.399
Caption: discipline

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:58.319
Caption: um in GDC and this one was critiquing

00:07:56.399 --> 00:08:01.679
Caption: game visuals common problems and how to

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:04.679
Caption: solve them by Ali Overton of spryfox

00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:08.039
Caption: um and the core of the talk was just uh

00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:09.598
Caption: figuring out how you can critique a

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:11.160
Caption: visual design figure out what needs to

00:08:09.598 --> 00:08:14.098
Caption: be improved about it and then make those

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.679
Caption: improvements but I loved this talk

00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:18.859
Caption: because I tell you what I am so bad at

00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:21.720
Caption: this it&#39;s unreal

00:08:18.859 --> 00:08:23.638
Caption: any time I work on a piece of software

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.979
Caption: myself and there isn&#39;t a designer

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:29.460
Caption: involved somebody&#39;s poor eyes will

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:31.259
Caption: probably bleed and I have tried to solve

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:33.059
Caption: this for myself many times I&#39;ve just

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:35.338
Caption: like got a blog post and I&#39;ve gone to

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:37.320
Caption: you know learning material to figure out

00:08:35.338 --> 00:08:39.838
Caption: color theory I&#39;ve studied color theory

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.479
Caption: got color theory down it still makes

00:08:39.838 --> 00:08:46.320
Caption: people&#39;s eyes bleed what&#39;s going on and

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:48.179
Caption: this video finally got through to me and

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.160
Caption: I&#39;m sure it would be different for

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:52.260
Caption: everybody but for me it was just like

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:54.119
Caption: the I just wasn&#39;t taking saturation into

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.040
Caption: consideration I didn&#39;t even really

00:08:54.119 --> 00:08:57.359
Caption: understand what saturation was trying it

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:58.979
Caption: was getting at

00:08:57.359 --> 00:09:01.320
Caption: um and everything I ever designed was

00:08:58.979 --> 00:09:03.299
Caption: just like full saturation all the time

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.398
Caption: and that&#39;s why the eyes were bleeding

00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:07.440
Caption: and now I know

00:09:05.398 --> 00:09:09.539
Caption: um so very happy for that I mean you got

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.820
Caption: an example here of one of the little

00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:14.699
Caption: bits that she took us through and you

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:17.100
Caption: can just see that the one on the left is

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.200
Caption: um really like pretty evenly desaturated

00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:20.880
Caption: and you have to work hard to decide

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.338
Caption: what&#39;s important in that image but the

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.039
Caption: one on the right there&#39;s a bit more um

00:09:23.338 --> 00:09:27.659
Caption: value contrast and saturation contrast

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:29.940
Caption: and you can see that the little man with

00:09:27.659 --> 00:09:32.278
Caption: the sword is important maybe the tree is

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:35.419
Caption: important but lots of little lessons

00:09:32.278 --> 00:09:35.419
Caption: like that stacked in there

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:41.760
Caption: um and now we come to war of a bit of a

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:43.559
Caption: leadership bit of a cultivating culture

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.479
Caption: in your business

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:47.278
Caption: um kind of lesson so this one was from

00:09:45.479 --> 00:09:49.320
Caption: Victoria Tran of in a sloth the guys

00:09:47.278 --> 00:09:50.580
Caption: that make Among Us

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.239
Caption: um Talk was called Charming your

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.940
Caption: communities and she took us through a

00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:58.799
Caption: whole bunch of

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:00.898
Caption: lessons on how to create a really

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:04.260
Caption: positive culture and she was always

00:10:00.898 --> 00:10:06.719
Caption: framing it in terms of the community

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.119
Caption: that is playing her game and interacting

00:10:06.719 --> 00:10:11.338
Caption: so on socials and interacting with each

00:10:09.119 --> 00:10:13.018
Caption: other in the game but every single

00:10:11.338 --> 00:10:15.179
Caption: lesson that she went through I was

00:10:13.018 --> 00:10:16.739
Caption: realizing could be applied equally well

00:10:15.179 --> 00:10:18.419
Caption: to building the culture within your

00:10:16.739 --> 00:10:21.239
Caption: company or within your team if you&#39;re

00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:22.919
Caption: just like a lead developer in a team you

00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:24.419
Caption: can use these skills to make sure that

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:27.719
Caption: your team is happy and healthy and

00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:29.338
Caption: functionally engaged if you&#39;re a CEO you

00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:30.599
Caption: can be exercising these techniques as

00:10:29.338 --> 00:10:33.539
Caption: well

00:10:30.599 --> 00:10:36.239
Caption: um pretty sure she got a lot of this

00:10:33.539 --> 00:10:38.039
Caption: stuff from a book called The Power of

00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:41.458
Caption: moments which if you have heard of it is

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:42.958
Caption: it worth a read but the the key things

00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:45.898
Caption: I&#39;ll just quickly mention that she

00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:48.119
Caption: talked about were having moments of

00:10:45.898 --> 00:10:49.859
Caption: surprise and levity so if you&#39;re always

00:10:48.119 --> 00:10:52.140
Caption: having to deliver the same kind of dry

00:10:49.859 --> 00:10:54.419
Caption: email once a week of like oh here&#39;s

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.940
Caption: what&#39;s changed in our Apple release

00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:58.440
Caption: notes or what have you insert jokes

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.720
Caption: insert little moments that people can

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.338
Caption: relate to and have a good time with

00:11:00.719 --> 00:11:04.439
Caption: um especially the more unexpected the

00:11:02.338 --> 00:11:07.260
Caption: better the more it will catch people and

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:10.679
Caption: go oh that was interesting

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:13.799
Caption: um moments of connectivity and empathy

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:16.859
Caption: so uh best example that I really enjoyed

00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:19.018
Caption: was paying attention if somebody&#39;s

00:11:16.859 --> 00:11:20.518
Caption: mentioned something that&#39;s going on in

00:11:19.018 --> 00:11:22.979
Caption: their life or something they&#39;re really

00:11:20.518 --> 00:11:24.179
Caption: really passionate about and you come

00:11:22.979 --> 00:11:25.859
Caption: across them or you&#39;re chatting to them

00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:28.440
Caption: two weeks later completely without

00:11:25.859 --> 00:11:31.018
Caption: provocation just bring it up shows that

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.599
Caption: you&#39;re listening that you care that you

00:11:31.018 --> 00:11:35.458
Caption: think about that person and they&#39;ll feel

00:11:33.599 --> 00:11:38.458
Caption: connected to you and that will breed

00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:41.059
Caption: this really positive warm relationship

00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:44.518
Caption: a bit of just Rapport building really

00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:46.200
Caption: and yeah there&#39;s one that I&#39;ve forgotten

00:11:44.518 --> 00:11:48.739
Caption: and I don&#39;t want to refer to my net so

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.739
Caption: we&#39;ll move on

00:11:49.018 --> 00:11:52.260
Caption: um

00:11:49.919 --> 00:11:54.739
Caption: next up we have Isabel mccard David

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:57.179
Caption: Richard of behavior interactive

00:11:54.739 --> 00:11:59.760
Caption: I wanted to include this one because

00:11:57.179 --> 00:12:01.859
Caption: there&#39;s

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.838
Caption: at least from my perspective as a

00:12:01.859 --> 00:12:05.398
Caption: developer

00:12:02.838 --> 00:12:08.578
Caption: I don&#39;t like to think too much about the

00:12:05.398 --> 00:12:10.859
Caption: money or the the financial strategy of

00:12:08.578 --> 00:12:13.078
Caption: things but you can learn those lessons

00:12:10.859 --> 00:12:16.700
Caption: if you go and have a look at GDC so

00:12:13.078 --> 00:12:21.260
Caption: Isabel mccard and David Richard were the

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:23.760
Caption: CFO and the head designer or director

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:26.640
Caption: from Behavior Interactive

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.040
Caption: and these guys are responsible for dead

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.559
Caption: by daylight which is uh online

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:33.659
Caption: multiplayer game it&#39;s free one character

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:36.000
Caption: one person plays a monster and another

00:12:33.659 --> 00:12:38.759
Caption: handful of people play survivors as a

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.679
Caption: asymmetrical

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.838
Caption: um competitive game

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:44.760
Caption: but it&#39;s run with macro transactions

00:12:42.838 --> 00:12:47.578
Caption: that&#39;s their profit model is monetizing

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.278
Caption: through buying skins and stuff like that

00:12:47.578 --> 00:12:52.500
Caption: um the talk is all about

00:12:50.278 --> 00:12:55.760
Caption: um respecting your users

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:58.320
Caption: being really careful to not exploit them

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.059
Caption: trying to run that business model which

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.039
Caption: is really kind of in a lot of ways

00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:03.539
Caption: unpopular there&#39;s a lot of assumptions

00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:05.338
Caption: baked into it that you&#39;re just kind of

00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:08.099
Caption: going to get a crap product unless you

00:13:05.338 --> 00:13:09.838
Caption: shill out all the time uh doing that in

00:13:08.099 --> 00:13:12.299
Caption: a really respectful way and they come up

00:13:09.838 --> 00:13:14.940
Caption: with a lot of techniques a lot of core

00:13:12.299 --> 00:13:15.958
Caption: kind of vision statements about for

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.679
Caption: example

00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:19.799
Caption: um

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:22.380
Caption: the the core product or by itself needs

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:24.958
Caption: to be completely playable enjoyable on

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:27.000
Caption: its own uh things that cost money should

00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:29.638
Caption: really only add kind of aesthetic value

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.559
Caption: or Vibe shouldn&#39;t really change the core

00:13:29.638 --> 00:13:34.199
Caption: mechanics of your product and I feel

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:36.059
Caption: like that&#39;s very applicable to

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.739
Caption: um you know just software as a service

00:13:36.059 --> 00:13:39.419
Caption: products that we sell maybe we&#39;re

00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:41.219
Caption: providing advertising or what have you

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:44.099
Caption: but just to do it in a respectful way

00:13:41.219 --> 00:13:46.078
Caption: but the key quote that um Dave Richard

00:13:44.099 --> 00:13:47.338
Caption: came out with that I latched on to and

00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:49.979
Caption: the lesson that I really took from this

00:13:47.338 --> 00:13:52.018
Caption: mostly was a respectful monetization

00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:54.778
Caption: design helps to get buy-in from our Dev

00:13:52.018 --> 00:13:57.838
Caption: team and when I heard that what I really

00:13:54.778 --> 00:14:00.419
Caption: heard was running an ethical respectful

00:13:57.838 --> 00:14:02.398
Caption: business gets team members on board and

00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:05.219
Caption: giving it their best so

00:14:02.398 --> 00:14:08.578
Caption: I&#39;m sure we&#39;d all love to be working in

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:10.919
Caption: really socially forward businesses like

00:14:08.578 --> 00:14:13.099
Caption: carbon offsetting businesses and

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:16.739
Caption: environmentally positive businesses

00:14:13.099 --> 00:14:18.539
Caption: businesses that help guys doing it tough

00:14:16.739 --> 00:14:20.820
Caption: that kind of thing

00:14:18.539 --> 00:14:22.979
Caption: but even if you&#39;re not even if you&#39;re in

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.559
Caption: resources or you&#39;re just working on an

00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:27.000
Caption: entertaining product or just tech for

00:14:25.559 --> 00:14:28.159
Caption: the sake of tech and helping people do

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.200
Caption: Tech better

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:34.259
Caption: as long as you&#39;re operating that

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.179
Caption: business ethically respectfully caring

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.679
Caption: about your users and caring about the

00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:39.838
Caption: impacts that your business is having

00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:42.479
Caption: that&#39;s the key thing and I think if you

00:14:39.838 --> 00:14:44.219
Caption: do that people will get on board they&#39;ll

00:14:42.479 --> 00:14:45.958
Caption: work their hardest they&#39;ll be engaged

00:14:44.219 --> 00:14:49.259
Caption: you won&#39;t have team members that are

00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:50.698
Caption: kind of maybe looking out the door

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.380
Caption: um and that&#39;s the lesson that I took

00:14:50.698 --> 00:14:53.940
Caption: from that particular talk and also it

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.578
Caption: was just really interesting learning

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:58.018
Caption: more about monetization strategies and

00:14:56.578 --> 00:15:01.260
Caption: what you&#39;ve seen
