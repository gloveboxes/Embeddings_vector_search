00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:26.309
Caption: to tell you a little bit of story I

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.040
Caption: guess about why I feel that way and and

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:34.110
Caption: something that&#39;s shaped my life

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:36.539
Caption: so I was 17 years old and I was at a

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.309
Caption: shopping center and my lunch break and I

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.989
Caption: looked at my watch and I was like crap

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:41.660
Caption: I&#39;m running late again to get back to

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.680
Caption: work for those of you that know me

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.100
Caption: nothing much has changed I&#39;m always

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:48.750
Caption: running late for everything so I run

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.180
Caption: towards I raced towards the traffic

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.429
Caption: lights don&#39;t run I walk because I still

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:55.919
Caption: don&#39;t run I walk so walk as quickly as I

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:56.519
Caption: can towards a traffic light and I look

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.619
Caption: at the lights

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.020
Caption: it&#39;s a six-lane highway my works just

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:03.809
Caption: across the road and there&#39;s a little red

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.520
Caption: man and I&#39;m like I don&#39;t have time to

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:06.089
Caption: wait for the green man who waits for the

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.300
Caption: green man

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:16.829
Caption: so look left look right and I run the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.790
Caption: next thing I remember is an intensely

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.048
Caption: loud sound of cars zooming past me and I

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.119
Caption: couldn&#39;t see anything but I could just

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.610
Caption: hear this zoom

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:28.829
Caption: zooom and it was so intensely loud and i

00:04:26.609 --> 00:04:30.388
Caption: remember being afraid because i was like

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:32.879
Caption: oh my god a car&#39;s gonna hit me and I

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.010
Caption: tried to try to roll up my legs because

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.050
Caption: I think at that point I was laying down

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:42.900
Caption: and I couldn&#39;t move the next thing I

00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:45.299
Caption: remember was the sound of my friends and

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:47.009
Caption: colleagues voice Leanne and she said to

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:51.989
Caption: me you in an ambulance Donna

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:54.570
Caption: everything&#39;s gonna be okay the next

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:57.119
Caption: thing I remember was the sound of a

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.970
Caption: voice saying we can&#39;t move her we&#39;ve got

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:01.529
Caption: a need to cut off her clothes and I must

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.579
Caption: have started I must have been starting

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.440
Caption: to come around a little bit by this

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:06.478
Caption: stage because all I could think was oh

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.760
Caption: my god please don&#39;t cut off my clothes I

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.300
Caption: had a work uniform on and it accussed me

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.070
Caption: 120 dollars and at 17 years old only 75%

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:19.049
Caption: of the adult wage so I was like a whole

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.429
Caption: week&#39;s salary but they did anyway the

00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:23.099
Caption: next thing I remember was actually

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:25.250
Caption: waking up and I was in a hospital and my

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.510
Caption: family were there and there was a doctor

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.459
Caption: showing through some x-rays telling me

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.320
Caption: that everything was okay and I didn&#39;t

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:34.069
Caption: have any broken bones or any injuries

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.740
Caption: other than a few scratches on my fingers

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:40.289
Caption: what I found out later and this was by

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:41.759
Caption: talking to the driver obviously you

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.489
Caption: probably figured out I got hit by a car

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.229
Caption: and talking to the lady who was driving

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:48.750
Caption: the car who was way more traumatized by

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.160
Caption: the whole event than me she said that

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.869
Caption: she saw me standing on the side of the

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.149
Caption: road and she thought I looked directly

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:55.709
Caption: at her and then I just ran straight in

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:57.660
Caption: front of her and she was going 60

00:05:55.709 --> 00:06:00.359
Caption: kilometers an hour and she didn&#39;t have

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.160
Caption: time to even put on her brakes so I

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:03.779
Caption: rolled onto the carb on it

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.789
Caption: I smashed the windscreen broke up with

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.098
Caption: my head my head was pretty sore for a

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:11.549
Caption: while after that and landed on the

00:06:08.098 --> 00:06:14.579
Caption: ground on the other side of the car so

00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:16.649
Caption: that whole experience for me was an

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:19.500
Caption: incredible experience because it really

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:23.369
Caption: made me realize that I could have been

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.989
Caption: gone my life could have been over and I

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:27.359
Caption: wouldn&#39;t have had any morning I didn&#39;t

00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:30.239
Caption: see the car I had no idea I was

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:31.500
Caption: unconscious for hours and it just could

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:33.059
Caption: have been over I wouldn&#39;t have had a

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.209
Caption: chance to take things off my bucket list

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:37.470
Caption: or have regrets it just would have been

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:39.479
Caption: gone

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.100
Caption: so for me that experience has really

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.610
Caption: shaped the whole way that I live my life

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.830
Caption: I believe that life is too short and you

00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:49.589
Caption: can be gone tomorrow so make today count

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:58.139
Caption: and do what you want to do and do what

00:06:49.589 --> 00:07:00.209
Caption: you enjoy doing and on that we have the

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.640
Caption: power to choose we have the power to

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:05.459
Caption: choose how we live a life where we work

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.990
Caption: what we do every day what goals to set

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:09.630
Caption: and how we make a difference in this

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:10.859
Caption: world and the talk earlier today on

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.070
Caption: making a difference in the world was

00:07:10.859 --> 00:07:16.919
Caption: amazing and you know we all have that

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.929
Caption: choice now some of us don&#39;t know what we

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.080
Caption: want to do we don&#39;t know what we enjoy

00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:24.179
Caption: we don&#39;t know what our passion is so if

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:25.889
Caption: you don&#39;t know that&#39;s okay but there&#39;s

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:28.320
Caption: tools that there are out there to help

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:31.530
Caption: figure that out I&#39;m a big fan of simon

Caption: Sinek and his model of the Golden Circle

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:35.220
Caption: and we&#39;ll had that in his talk earlier

00:07:33.929 --> 00:07:36.660
Caption: as well I feel like there&#39;s going to be

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.809
Caption: quite a few things that Will&#39;s already

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:42.690
Caption: covered but that&#39;s good

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:44.010
Caption: but in his book how to find your why it

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.440
Caption: really talks you through some practical

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:48.450
Caption: steps of how to figure out what those

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.980
Caption: passion areas are and what it is that

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.930
Caption: you enjoy and what it is that you should

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.390
Caption: be doing with your life so I&#39;d highly

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:57.449
Caption: recommend it the other technique that

00:07:54.390 --> 00:08:00.630
Caption: I&#39;ve used before and and I recommend is

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:02.370
Caption: to think about if you unload like we all

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.559
Caption: think about oh my god like what if I

00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:05.000
Caption: want a lotto but actually think it

00:08:04.559 --> 00:08:08.910
Caption: through

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.380
Caption: so think about sure I might travel the

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.570
Caption: world for 12 months or do some crazy

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.520
Caption: stuff for 12 months but then after that

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:17.010
Caption: when that stuff starts to get a little

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:19.049
Caption: boring how do you feel your time what

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:21.150
Caption: does your life look like and if you

00:08:19.049 --> 00:08:22.529
Caption: really reflect on that you know then you

00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:24.179
Caption: can start thinking about well how can I

00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:26.660
Caption: turn that into something that I can make

00:08:24.179 --> 00:08:29.160
Caption: money out of and it can be my job and

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.989
Caption: you know what this is trial and error so

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.390
Caption: don&#39;t be afraid to fail

00:08:30.989 --> 00:08:37.440
Caption: I&#39;ve had lots of different careers from

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:39.690
Caption: childcare to recruitment to HR to

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.549

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:45.719
Caption: whatever it is that you enjoy and a

00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:47.279
Caption: passionate about look for the comments

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:48.329
Caption: look for sideways moves within your

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.760
Caption: company if you want to try out different

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.200
Caption: roles

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.580
Caption: and look for sideways moves to other

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.239
Caption: companies if you want to try out new

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:58.309
Caption: companies one of the other great things

00:08:56.239 --> 00:09:01.399
Caption: that I read recently was the book the

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:02.690
Caption: subtle art of not giving a Fu CK and I

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.580
Caption: am getting recorded so I don&#39;t think I

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:06.890
Caption: can say that word but it&#39;s an awesome

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.470
Caption: book and one of the best tips out of

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:12.049
Caption: that book was that our brains love

00:09:09.469 --> 00:09:14.029
Caption: solving problems so if we solve all of

00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:17.239
Caption: the problems our brain will create more

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:18.920
Caption: problems for us so when you&#39;re living

00:09:17.239 --> 00:09:21.229
Caption: your life and when you&#39;re looking at

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:23.089

Caption: just gonna need to keep continuously

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:29.150
Caption: solving them because that&#39;s what our

00:09:25.789 --> 00:09:30.979
Caption: brains love doing so that was a really

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.930
Caption: big Segway into building best place to

00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:35.419
Caption: work culture but there were two main

00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:37.339
Caption: points that I wanted to make one is that

00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:39.889
Caption: it&#39;s no one else&#39;s job a responsibility

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.830
Caption: to make you happy at work only you have

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.989
Caption: that power

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:46.400
Caption: Patrick&#39;s talk was great and just then

00:09:44.989 --> 00:09:48.529
Caption: for anyone that heard in on toxic

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.900
Caption: developers and one of the things around

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:53.660
Caption: that is internal versus external locus

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.010
Caption: of control and if people haven&#39;t read up

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:56.959
Caption: on locus of control as most of you

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.250
Caption: probably have but have a bit of a rate

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.950
Caption: of it because if you&#39;re not sure whether

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.869
Caption: maybe you are a toxic developer external

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.480
Caption: locus of control is generally where they

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:08.029
Caption: focus you internal locus of control

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:10.339
Caption: means that you have that have the power

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:13.250
Caption: to control your actions how you react

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:18.650
Caption: your behaviors how you reframe things we

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:20.090
Caption: have that power ourselves and the other

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.130
Caption: thing is that all of us as employees

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:24.470
Caption: have the power to help make the place we

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.780
Caption: work a best place to work it will happen

00:10:24.469 --> 00:10:28.989
Caption: a lot quicker if you don&#39;t rely on HR or

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.310
Caption: managers to do it for you

00:10:28.989 --> 00:10:33.649
Caption: one of my consultants recently came up

00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:36.380
Caption: to me and told me about some issues that

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.760
Caption: he saw with the grad program and he

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.010
Caption: asked me whether he could have some time

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.540
Caption: dedicated to owning it and running it

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:44.929
Caption: and I&#39;m putting in place some of these

00:10:41.539 --> 00:10:46.880
Caption: solutions I was like hell yes so if you

Caption: the solution and you want to own it and

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:55.909
Caption: drive it most leaders are gonna say yes

00:10:50.599 --> 00:10:58.789
Caption: but if you don&#39;t ask you don&#39;t get so

00:10:55.909 --> 00:11:01.009

Caption: award on to all of that marketing

00:11:38.659 --> 00:11:42.169
Caption: material and your employer branding it

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.030
Caption: straight away it gives candidates

00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:45.739
Caption: something a bit more tangible and they

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.000
Caption: can go you know what this company must

00:11:45.739 --> 00:11:48.380
Caption: be a great place to work because they&#39;ve

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.239
Caption: been awarded something they&#39;ve gone

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.609
Caption: through a process and they&#39;ve been given

00:11:50.239 --> 00:11:57.950
Caption: an award so it&#39;s a really really good

00:11:52.609 --> 00:12:00.469
Caption: tool and I guess a specific example of

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:03.049
Caption: how this worked for me as someone

00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:04.729
Caption: recruiting staff previously I don&#39;t know

00:12:03.049 --> 00:12:06.349
Caption: if anyone&#39;s use LinkedIn to recruit

00:12:04.729 --> 00:12:08.059
Caption: staff but they have a program they have

00:12:06.349 --> 00:12:10.009
Caption: in mails so you can send emails to

00:12:08.059 --> 00:12:11.570
Caption: people that you don&#39;t know and and

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:13.340
Caption: approach them and try and connect with

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:16.669
Caption: them to get them to come through your

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:18.860
Caption: interview recruitment process are in

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:21.409
Caption: male response rate the acceptance rate

00:12:18.859 --> 00:12:23.719
Caption: went up by over 25% after we had an

00:12:21.409 --> 00:12:26.029
Caption: award just by writing on that email

00:12:23.719 --> 00:12:27.529
Caption: we&#39;re number eight best place to work or

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:31.010
Caption: we&#39;re number six best place to work

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:32.840
Caption: 25% increase in acceptance which is huge

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.690
Caption: I think the average acceptance rate is

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:41.330
Caption: about 8% of in mouth it&#39;s super super

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:42.710
Caption: low so how do I actually win one with

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.049
Caption: the brw award there&#39;s two main

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:47.809
Caption: components the first one is a culture

00:12:45.049 --> 00:12:50.500
Caption: survey so a great place to work send out

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:53.029
Caption: an anonymous survey to all of your staff

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.590
Caption: the main tip here is that it&#39;s a really

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.600
Caption: high completion rate that you need it&#39;s

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.790
Caption: about 95 percent so you do need to let

00:12:56.599 --> 00:13:00.409
Caption: your staff know that there is a survey

00:12:58.789 --> 00:13:02.299
Caption: coming and please can you fill it out

00:13:00.409 --> 00:13:02.899
Caption: and obviously you want to hope that

00:13:02.299 --> 00:13:05.750
Caption: they&#39;re going to say good things

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:08.300
Caption: otherwise there&#39;s no point the second

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:10.280
Caption: part is a document where they ask you a

00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:14.119
Caption: whole heap of questions about how you do

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.530
Caption: things and I guess the main thing I want

00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:16.940
Caption: to make clear here is they&#39;re not

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:19.850
Caption: looking for

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:21.229
Caption: policies procedures blah blah blah

00:13:19.849 --> 00:13:22.579
Caption: although you know if you&#39;ve got some of

00:13:21.229 --> 00:13:24.559
Caption: those you can add them but they&#39;re

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.929
Caption: looking for real-life examples they&#39;re

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:28.400
Caption: looking for pictures they&#39;re looking for

00:13:26.929 --> 00:13:30.080
Caption: quotes from your employees they&#39;re

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.230
Caption: looking for stories about your employees

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.869
Caption: they actually want real pictures our

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:37.130
Caption: second for our second submission for a

00:13:35.869 --> 00:13:38.270
Caption: further mission we had some marketing

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.410
Caption: help because we&#39;ve never done it before

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.660
Caption: and we didn&#39;t know where to start

00:13:39.409 --> 00:13:43.459
Caption: for our second submission based on the

00:13:41.659 --> 00:13:46.250
Caption: feedback we&#39;ve gotten I just wrote it

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:48.050
Caption: myself because they don&#39;t care about it

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:50.270
Caption: being all schmack and amazing they just

00:13:48.049 --> 00:13:52.489
Caption: want to know the real stories so if

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.140
Caption: you&#39;ve got great stories and you can get

00:13:52.489 --> 00:13:55.909
Caption: your people to tell them and put that

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.390
Caption: into a document that&#39;s what they&#39;re

00:13:55.909 --> 00:13:59.599
Caption: looking for

00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:01.220
Caption: so specifically how you drive things

00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:03.769
Caption: like communication across the company

00:14:01.219 --> 00:14:06.129
Caption: how you thank your employees how you

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:08.480
Caption: make them feel welcome when they join

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.700
Caption: how you&#39;re transparent across your

00:14:08.479 --> 00:14:12.829
Caption: organization is a big one how you enable

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:17.419
Caption: career progression and then real life

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:19.040
Caption: stories for all of those things so in

00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:21.529
Caption: terms of what actually makes a great

00:14:19.039 --> 00:14:25.239
Caption: place to work in my experience it&#39;s

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.240
Caption: these six main areas

00:14:33.229 --> 00:14:40.630
Caption: so a best place to work is all about

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:43.309
Caption: culture and what is culture culture is

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:45.650
Caption: values beliefs and behaviors that are

00:14:43.309 --> 00:14:47.960
Caption: shared and demonstrated across your

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:51.980
Caption: company there&#39;s some common themes in

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.480
Caption: text in turkey around values around the

00:14:51.979 --> 00:14:55.429
Caption: Facebook&#39;s the Amazons the googles of

00:14:53.479 --> 00:14:57.679
Caption: the world and they&#39;re around ownership

00:14:55.429 --> 00:14:58.940
Caption: collaboration learning and innovation so

00:14:57.679 --> 00:15:01.940
Caption: there&#39;s some of the key ones that come

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:03.349
Caption: up again and again and again ideally

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.119
Caption: though you want to involve your team&#39;s

00:15:03.349 --> 00:15:07.819
Caption: collaboratively when you come up with

00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:09.289
Caption: these values or beliefs because I think

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.910
Caption: we all know one person doesn&#39;t make a

00:15:09.289 --> 00:15:13.369
Caption: culture every single person in your

00:15:10.909 --> 00:15:14.599
Caption: organization do so ensuring that you&#39;re

00:15:13.369 --> 00:15:16.190
Caption: picking the right ones

00:15:14.599 --> 00:15:18.079
Caption: and that everyone&#39;s on board with them

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:21.470
Caption: is really important otherwise they won&#39;t

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:24.619
Caption: be shared values and your company does

00:15:21.469 --> 00:15:27.500
Caption: that need to be a startup to do this you

00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:30.049
Caption: can do this with an existing company at

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.719
Caption: ratify for example Rob Moore led the

00:15:30.049 --> 00:15:34.880
Caption: charge to create some core beliefs that

00:15:32.719 --> 00:15:37.459
Caption: you see up here today and this was only

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.869
Caption: 12 months ago so he did this with a

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.210
Caption: group of people and they did it on

00:15:38.869 --> 00:15:43.279
Caption: Yammer completely transparently and

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.570
Caption: collaboratively I made got engagement

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.490
Caption: from people they&#39;ve got people to talk

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.200
Caption: about what they wanted their beliefs to

00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:50.719
Caption: be what they thought our culture was

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.910
Caption: what we wanted this to look like and by

00:15:50.719 --> 00:15:54.739
Caption: choosing these collaboratively it means

00:15:52.909 --> 00:15:58.399
Caption: that people have really bought into them

00:15:54.739 --> 00:16:00.229
Caption: and owning them and drive them when I

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.930
Caption: first joined my previous company igneel

00:16:00.229 --> 00:16:04.940
Caption: we had about 25 people at the time and

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:07.549
Caption: they hadn&#39;t gone through that process of

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:10.729
Caption: creating shared values so it was easy so

00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:12.589
Caption: I reached out to all of the staff I got

00:16:10.729 --> 00:16:14.449
Caption: everybody involved in it was a bit old

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:16.190
Caption: school email and phone and stuff you

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:18.830
Caption: know back in the day quite a few years

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.970
Caption: ago now and I got people to talk to me

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.730
Caption: about you know what they thought I

00:16:19.969 --> 00:16:24.559
Caption: culture was they wanted it to be I got

00:16:22.729 --> 00:16:26.659
Caption: them to send me pictures or words or

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:28.429
Caption: stories to describe what they wanted it

00:16:26.659 --> 00:16:31.759
Caption: to look like and we came up with our

00:16:28.429 --> 00:16:33.380
Caption: values collaboratively and that was one

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.570
Caption: of the key reasons that helped us to

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.400
Caption: double in size over 12 months and to win

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:41.000
Caption: at s place to work award so it&#39;s a

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:43.820
Caption: really important part the other major

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.809
Caption: component of shared values is rewarding

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.419
Caption: the behavior that you want to encourage

00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:50.849
Caption: and also thinking about the stories that

00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:54.508
Caption: you tell as well around the behavior you

00:16:50.849 --> 00:16:56.518
Caption: want to encourage I was at an event a

00:16:54.508 --> 00:16:58.258
Caption: few weeks ago now and it was quite a

00:16:56.518 --> 00:17:01.859
Caption: high-profile person who was speaking and

00:16:58.258 --> 00:17:03.479
Caption: she was talking about telling stories to

00:17:01.859 --> 00:17:05.609
Caption: drive your culture and behavior and I

00:17:03.479 --> 00:17:08.068
Caption: was like yeah ton of percent totally

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:09.750
Caption: agree anyway she was talking about in

00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:11.938
Caption: the interview process so instead of in

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.678
Caption: an interview saying this is the criteria

00:17:11.938 --> 00:17:16.890
Caption: we want these are our expectations

00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:18.750
Caption: telling the candidate a story about your

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:21.510
Caption: culture and about people in your

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:23.400
Caption: organization who you&#39;re you&#39;re rewarding

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.708
Caption: and our examples of the behavior that

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:30.299
Caption: you want to portray and she told this

00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:32.189
Caption: story about a graduate and there was a

00:17:30.298 --> 00:17:34.558
Caption: graduate working on a team project and

00:17:32.189 --> 00:17:36.058
Caption: the project was due on Monday and the

00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:38.158
Caption: graduate came in has spent the entire

00:17:36.058 --> 00:17:40.109
Caption: weekend working on this project to

00:17:38.159 --> 00:17:41.549
Caption: really take it to the next level so that

00:17:40.109 --> 00:17:43.530
Caption: on the Monday when they delivered this

00:17:41.548 --> 00:17:45.298
Caption: this project to the customer the

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.400
Caption: customer was absolutely blown away it

00:17:45.298 --> 00:17:48.928
Caption: was fantastic and she was talking about

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.030
Caption: you know how awesome this grad was

00:17:48.928 --> 00:17:52.500
Caption: because they went above and beyond and

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:57.030
Caption: they really you know made this produce

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:59.729
Caption: project a success and for me I was

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:02.039
Caption: thinking about it and I was like do I

00:17:59.729 --> 00:18:05.538
Caption: want my graduate on my staff to come in

00:18:02.038 --> 00:18:08.279
Caption: and work or weekend on a project know

00:18:05.538 --> 00:18:09.928
Caption: you know do I want the hero complex of

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.460
Caption: one person coming in and putting in a

00:18:09.928 --> 00:18:13.819
Caption: whole heap of hours to make something

00:18:11.459 --> 00:18:16.770
Caption: awesome instead of working with a team

00:18:13.819 --> 00:18:19.408
Caption: know so for me when I thought about that

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:22.080
Caption: story it displayed a culture that I

00:18:19.409 --> 00:18:24.030
Caption: wouldn&#39;t want for my company so you need

00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:26.308
Caption: to be really careful about these stories

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:31.080
Caption: that you tell because that&#39;s what

00:18:26.308 --> 00:18:33.239
Caption: actually drives your culture this is a

00:18:31.079 --> 00:18:34.589
Caption: huge area and definitely one of the most

00:18:33.239 --> 00:18:35.250
Caption: important although I probably say that

00:18:34.589 --> 00:18:37.168
Caption: about all of them

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.359
Caption: but everyone knows you don&#39;t leave

00:18:37.168 --> 00:18:41.158
Caption: companies right you leave managers so

00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:44.398
Caption: how about instead of having managers we

00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:46.350
Caption: have leaders and I want to make it clear

00:18:44.399 --> 00:18:48.239
Caption: that anyone can be a leader you don&#39;t

00:18:46.349 --> 00:18:50.130
Caption: need to have a manager title or being a

00:18:48.239 --> 00:18:52.798
Caption: senior position to act like a leader

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.750
Caption: I&#39;ve been upwards managing and leading

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:57.918
Caption: for much much longer than having a

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:59.699
Caption: specific manager title title can help

00:18:57.918 --> 00:19:02.278
Caption: absolutely but it&#39;s not

00:18:59.699 --> 00:19:04.829
Caption: necessary people follow great leaders

00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:08.100
Caption: and so the title will come if you

00:19:04.829 --> 00:19:09.298
Caption: actually behave like a leader so if you

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:12.298
Caption: do want to win the best place to work

00:19:09.298 --> 00:19:13.768
Caption: award you need to have good leaders if

00:19:12.298 --> 00:19:15.689
Caption: they have gaps provide them with

00:19:13.769 --> 00:19:17.730
Caption: training there&#39;s so much great

00:19:15.689 --> 00:19:20.489
Caption: leadership training out there we

00:19:17.729 --> 00:19:24.359
Caption: recently had a session with a consultant

00:19:20.489 --> 00:19:25.889
Caption: from Sydney named Georgia emerge and it

00:19:24.359 --> 00:19:27.630
Caption: was around specifically communication

00:19:25.889 --> 00:19:29.880
Caption: for leaders and one of the best tips she

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:32.849
Caption: gave was nip it in the bud

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:35.010
Caption: nip things in the bud so if you see

00:19:32.849 --> 00:19:37.500
Caption: something that&#39;s a bit of an issue jump

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:39.928
Caption: on it quickly before it escalates and

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.279
Caption: things will be a lot easier and I think

00:19:39.928 --> 00:19:42.839
Caption: some of that resonates you know with

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:44.909
Caption: perhaps to talk again about toxic

00:19:42.839 --> 00:19:47.969
Caption: developers if you see little issues jump

00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:50.010
Caption: on them quickly in early illuminate

00:19:47.969 --> 00:19:51.449
Caption: group is the local W a company and they

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:53.579
Caption: do some awesome training around

00:19:51.449 --> 00:19:56.069
Caption: innovation and also general leadership

00:19:53.579 --> 00:19:57.928
Caption: courses they also have a course that&#39;s

00:19:56.069 --> 00:19:59.849
Caption: run through the department training so

00:19:57.928 --> 00:20:02.250
Caption: it&#39;s family subsidized by the government

00:19:59.849 --> 00:20:02.819
Caption: which means that it&#39;s cost effective and

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.579
Caption: it&#39;s awesome

00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:07.949
Caption: win-win so there&#39;s there&#39;s really no

00:20:05.579 --> 00:20:09.989
Caption: shortage available I&#39;m also I also work

00:20:07.949 --> 00:20:11.668
Caption: with a company called coach connect so

00:20:09.989 --> 00:20:13.829
Caption: it&#39;s kind of the same principle as an

00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:15.329
Caption: EAP offering to your staff but it&#39;s

00:20:13.829 --> 00:20:18.028
Caption: actually coaching so it&#39;s the self

00:20:15.329 --> 00:20:19.168
Caption: development and self improvement so if

00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:21.360
Caption: you&#39;re interested in any type of

00:20:19.168 --> 00:20:22.798
Caption: training always happy to talk about that

00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:24.168
Caption: stuff and connect you with anybody that

00:20:22.798 --> 00:20:26.668
Caption: I know later on

00:20:24.168 --> 00:20:29.579
Caption: so some of the main areas as a

00:20:26.668 --> 00:20:33.479
Caption: leadership team that the leadership team

00:20:29.579 --> 00:20:36.268
Caption: needs to focus on is autonomy mastery

00:20:33.479 --> 00:20:39.058
Caption: and purpose and once again we&#39;ll cover

00:20:36.269 --> 00:20:41.700
Caption: this you know Dan pink in his talk as

00:20:39.058 --> 00:20:44.819
Caption: well the leadership team needs to set

00:20:41.699 --> 00:20:47.819
Caption: the vision where are we going and why

00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:49.979
Caption: and then provide the empowerment in the

00:20:47.819 --> 00:20:50.880
Caption: ownership for the team to figure out how

00:20:49.979 --> 00:20:52.619
Caption: we get there

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.839
Caption: and obviously the leadership teams there

00:20:52.619 --> 00:20:57.269
Caption: to support them but let your team be

00:20:54.839 --> 00:21:01.260
Caption: empowered to own it and come up with the

00:20:57.269 --> 00:21:03.899
Caption: how task driven environments are gone or

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.130
Caption: going firstly task driven jobs are the

00:21:03.899 --> 00:21:06.989
Caption: first ones getting replaced and

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.639
Caption: automated and secondly younger

00:21:06.989 --> 00:21:09.719
Caption: generations aren&#39;t interested in task

00:21:08.639 --> 00:21:12.149
Caption: driven jobs anymore

00:21:09.719 --> 00:21:13.469
Caption: there&#39;s no fulfillment in them so it

00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:15.330
Caption: needs to be more than that

00:21:13.469 --> 00:21:17.130
Caption: the other benefit with providing

00:21:15.329 --> 00:21:18.808
Caption: ownership and empowerment is that

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.849
Caption: flexibility doesn&#39;t become an issue

00:21:18.808 --> 00:21:22.109
Caption: anymore because it doesn&#39;t matter when

00:21:20.849 --> 00:21:23.760
Caption: or where people are working because

00:21:22.109 --> 00:21:25.770
Caption: they&#39;ve got things that they own and

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.849
Caption: that they&#39;re accountable to deliver so

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:29.849
Caption: you don&#39;t have to worry about that

00:21:26.849 --> 00:21:31.048
Caption: flexibility conversation anymore there&#39;s

00:21:29.849 --> 00:21:32.280
Caption: heaps and starts to show you that

00:21:31.048 --> 00:21:34.979
Caption: people&#39;s primary reason for coming to

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.900
Caption: work isn&#39;t money so leaders need to give

00:21:34.979 --> 00:21:40.770
Caption: them more than that they need to inspire

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:41.880
Caption: and set a vision the other key area is

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.169
Caption: transparency

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.030
Caption: once again that&#39;s been touched on

00:21:43.168 --> 00:21:50.339
Caption: already transparency and clear

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:53.039
Caption: expectations what equals success and how

00:21:50.339 --> 00:21:54.839
Caption: a decisions made one of the things that

00:21:53.038 --> 00:21:57.089
Caption: I&#39;ve been very impressed with are

00:21:54.839 --> 00:22:00.298
Caption: working at ratify is the level of

00:21:57.089 --> 00:22:02.339
Caption: transparency so our intranet can be

00:22:00.298 --> 00:22:05.699
Caption: edited by anyone across the organization

00:22:02.339 --> 00:22:08.099
Caption: and it contains literally everything it

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:10.139
Caption: hooks up to power bi which reports on

00:22:08.099 --> 00:22:11.908
Caption: all of our revenue across the

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.469
Caption: organization how much what are all of

00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:15.630
Caption: the rates are the charge out rates for

00:22:13.469 --> 00:22:17.548
Caption: consultants like literally anything to

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:19.829
Caption: do with financials are all completely

00:22:17.548 --> 00:22:21.658
Caption: transparent all of our targets as well

00:22:19.829 --> 00:22:24.109
Caption: are all completely transparent for

00:22:21.659 --> 00:22:27.000
Caption: everyone across the organization

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:29.099
Caption: decision making Yammer Yammer is used

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.780
Caption: for probably 95 percent of the

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:33.089
Caption: decision-making and it&#39;s completely

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.340
Caption: collaborative and open so leaders and

00:22:33.089 --> 00:22:37.168
Caption: and anybody can post something on Yama I

00:22:35.339 --> 00:22:38.969
Caption: think we should do this looking at a new

00:22:37.168 --> 00:22:41.788
Caption: initiative and everybody can just jump

00:22:38.969 --> 00:22:45.079
Caption: on give their opinion and and implement

00:22:41.788 --> 00:22:45.079
Caption: something if it all goes well

00:22:45.229 --> 00:22:49.918
Caption: another thing is flatter structures so a

00:22:48.089 --> 00:22:51.599
Caption: ratify instead of having a state manager

00:22:49.918 --> 00:22:53.489
Caption: we have a leadership group and that

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:56.130
Caption: leadership group collaboratively makes

00:22:53.489 --> 00:22:59.038
Caption: decisions and set strategies and for the

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:00.390
Caption: state so slotter structure is something

00:22:59.038 --> 00:23:02.069
Caption: that again and again is coming up that

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:06.989
Caption: people are looking for now in new

00:23:02.069 --> 00:23:09.719
Caption: company design another key area is

00:23:06.989 --> 00:23:12.000
Caption: empathy and emotional intelligence now

00:23:09.719 --> 00:23:14.699
Caption: in my opinion you can&#39;t be a leader if

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.520
Caption: you don&#39;t have these might be harsh but

00:23:14.699 --> 00:23:19.019
Caption: that&#39;s my opinion I&#39;ve seen so many tech

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.729
Caption: people promoted in the past because

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.399
Caption: they&#39;re a subject matter expert in what

00:23:20.729 --> 00:23:25.419
Caption: they do and the only way to move up to

00:23:23.399 --> 00:23:28.239
Caption: the next role was to be a manager

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.920
Caption: leader but they have a hater because

00:23:28.239 --> 00:23:31.329
Caption: they actually don&#39;t enjoy the role

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.070
Caption: because it&#39;s not what they want to do

00:23:31.329 --> 00:23:34.750
Caption: well they&#39;re just really terrible at it

00:23:33.069 --> 00:23:40.029
Caption: because they&#39;re not interested in

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:41.949
Caption: getting to know people replacing

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:44.469
Caption: yourself great leaders look to replace

00:23:41.949 --> 00:23:46.750
Caption: themselves we&#39;re moving to a very

00:23:44.469 --> 00:23:48.280
Caption: different way of working in job design

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:50.500
Caption: now you know back in the day there was

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.000
Caption: this linear career pathway so you had to

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.949
Caption: really protect your role because only

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.510
Caption: you could have that role and there was

00:23:53.949 --> 00:23:56.859
Caption: only one way to go and you want it to

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:59.500
Caption: protect it so that you could get that

00:23:56.859 --> 00:24:02.140
Caption: job it&#39;s not like that anymore so as a

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.880
Caption: leader if you can mentor and upskill

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.369
Caption: people around you to replace yourself

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.650
Caption: there&#39;s so many new jobs getting created

00:24:06.369 --> 00:24:11.520
Caption: every day that you can move into so you

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:13.630
Caption: don&#39;t have to have that fear anymore and

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.089
Caption: this one was definitely covered already

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:19.719
Caption: is leading by example and practicing

00:24:16.089 --> 00:24:21.250

Caption: inspired them throughout their career

00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:38.139
Caption: the quickest way to build trust and

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:41.020
Caption: respect is getting hands-on with your

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:43.450

Caption: leaders they don&#39;t do this but it&#39;s such

00:24:46.599 --> 00:24:50.199
Caption: a simple thing do what you say you would

00:24:48.489 --> 00:24:52.359
Caption: do if you say you&#39;ll be somewhere at a

00:24:50.199 --> 00:24:54.279

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:04.510

Caption: don&#39;t rock up for a meeting and you&#39;ve

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:09.010
Caption: rescheduled things to be there and they

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.109
Caption: don&#39;t see that you&#39;re valuable enough or

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:14.890
Caption: important enough to attend it&#39;s just a

00:25:11.109 --> 00:25:16.510

00:25:58.359 --> 00:26:02.678

00:26:13.869 --> 00:26:19.690

Caption: giving people training around hiring

00:26:50.339 --> 00:26:55.359
Caption: people just hire people like themselves

00:26:52.869 --> 00:26:56.679
Caption: we just default to hiring people who we

00:26:55.359 --> 00:27:00.099
Caption: get along with and who are the same as

00:26:56.678 --> 00:27:02.199
Caption: us hiring for culture fit can just be an

00:27:00.099 --> 00:27:05.109
Caption: excuse for this to hire people that you

00:27:02.199 --> 00:27:06.849
Caption: like and that you get along with so you

00:27:05.109 --> 00:27:09.969
Caption: need to create some structure and some

00:27:06.849 --> 00:27:11.558
Caption: real interview questions that are around

00:27:09.969 --> 00:27:15.069
Caption: your values and your beliefs so they&#39;re

00:27:11.558 --> 00:27:16.739
Caption: not about this gray culture they&#39;re

00:27:15.069 --> 00:27:18.658
Caption: about your values and your beliefs

00:27:16.739 --> 00:27:23.109

00:27:25.629 --> 00:27:29.649

Caption: been afraid to promote their people

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:12.520
Caption: because they might leave it&#39;s the

00:28:10.479 --> 00:28:14.949
Caption: opposite if you give you people that

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.420
Caption: that help and you know you pay for them

00:28:14.949 --> 00:28:17.859

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:02.440

00:30:05.719 --> 00:30:11.058

00:30:08.629 --> 00:30:13.070
Caption: companies were 15% more likely to be

00:30:11.058 --> 00:30:17.418
Caption: above the medium financial returns if

00:30:13.069 --> 00:30:19.428

00:30:17.418 --> 00:30:21.109
Caption: likely to be above financial return

00:30:19.428 --> 00:30:23.418
Caption: performance with racial and ethnic

00:30:21.109 --> 00:30:25.250
Caption: diversity so it&#39;s a huge conversation

00:30:23.418 --> 00:30:27.319
Caption: and it shouldn&#39;t be a conversation it

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:29.000
Caption: just is it&#39;s just factual we just need

00:30:27.319 --> 00:30:30.888
Caption: to have companies that have diversity

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.229
Caption: and we need to hire for diversity and

00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:35.269
Caption: what we were saying about team makeup

00:30:33.229 --> 00:30:37.009

00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:38.869

00:30:37.009 --> 00:30:41.029

00:30:38.869 --> 00:30:42.678

00:30:42.678 --> 00:30:48.439
Caption: diversity were in the bottom 25% and

00:30:45.109 --> 00:30:51.408
Caption: that&#39;s huge so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a no-brainer

00:30:48.439 --> 00:30:53.239
Caption: so educate your teams on the benefits of

00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:56.450
Caption: diversity and provide unconscious bias

00:30:53.239 --> 00:30:58.609

00:31:07.369 --> 00:31:12.529

00:31:18.798 --> 00:31:21.258
Caption: she will do this and I was like oh

00:31:20.298 --> 00:31:24.168

00:31:21.259 --> 00:31:26.629

00:31:31.308 --> 00:31:34.638
Caption: unconscious biases that we&#39;re so used to

00:31:32.989 --> 00:31:36.408

Caption: anonymous survey around terminologies so

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:28.940
Caption: using female as opposed to woman and

00:32:26.558 --> 00:32:31.209

00:32:28.939 --> 00:32:34.099

Caption: she wouldn&#39;t mind having answering some

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:43.190
Caption: questions and having a bit of a chat

00:32:40.849 --> 00:32:46.819
Caption: because I hadn&#39;t really worked with

00:32:43.189 --> 00:32:48.769

Caption: terminology and if females a real

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:58.099
Caption: biological term so transgender women

00:32:55.788 --> 00:33:00.109
Caption: prefer women woman as opposed to female

00:32:58.099 --> 00:33:03.260
Caption: but all these little things that I just

00:33:00.109 --> 00:33:05.329
Caption: would have never thought about so people

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:07.039
Caption: will be happy to educate you if you&#39;re

00:33:05.329 --> 00:33:08.719
Caption: genuine and you actually want to learn

00:33:07.038 --> 00:33:10.639
Caption: and want to improve and want to create

00:33:08.719 --> 00:33:13.038
Caption: an inclusive environment so don&#39;t be

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:16.339
Caption: afraid to ask what may be silly

00:33:13.038 --> 00:33:19.579
Caption: questions love silly questions also

00:33:16.339 --> 00:33:21.650

Caption: those types of considerations that we

00:33:28.038 --> 00:33:31.519
Caption: may not make because it doesn&#39;t affect

00:33:29.449 --> 00:33:33.380
Caption: us think about who&#39;s in your

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.690
Caption: organization think about who might be

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:38.479
Caption: joining and then create an inclusive

00:33:39.798 --> 00:33:44.899
Caption: become a norm which is amazing and also

00:33:43.038 --> 00:33:47.689
Caption: paid superannuation while on leave is

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.489
Caption: also starting to become a norm a bit of

00:33:47.689 --> 00:33:51.109
Caption: a shout out to a work 180 I think

00:33:49.489 --> 00:33:52.459
Caption: they&#39;ve done an incredible job there

00:33:51.109 --> 00:33:54.558

00:33:52.459 --> 00:33:56.538
Caption: a great job of targeting diversity

00:33:54.558 --> 00:34:01.058

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.889
Caption: agency there&#39;s a free application and

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:15.020
Caption: accreditation you can get that is

00:34:12.888 --> 00:34:16.608
Caption: another part of becoming a best place to

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:19.280
Caption: work having those sorts of things under

00:34:16.608 --> 00:34:22.638
Caption: your belt and lastly on this one

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.500
Caption: flexibility for everyone not just women

00:34:22.638 --> 00:34:26.270
Caption: or parents let&#39;s create an environment

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:29.358
Caption: where flexibility and diversity is just

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:31.790
Caption: the way that we work there&#39;s nothing

00:34:29.358 --> 00:34:32.928
Caption: special about it it&#39;s just the norm and

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:33.750
Caption: the sooner this happens the better for

00:34:32.928 --> 00:34:36.418
Caption: all of us

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:38.520
Caption: women and men I&#39;ve worked with quite a

00:34:36.418 --> 00:34:40.368
Caption: few men and women who both work who will

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.418
Caption: work part time not because I have kids

00:34:40.368 --> 00:34:43.739
Caption: but because they have passions and

00:34:42.418 --> 00:34:46.229
Caption: hobbies outside of work and they want to

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:47.668
Caption: have time to do those and that&#39;s awesome

00:34:46.229 --> 00:34:50.340
Caption: there&#39;s nothing wrong with that so let&#39;s

00:34:47.668 --> 00:34:52.878
Caption: just embrace the general flexibility

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.879
Caption: conversation

00:34:53.868 --> 00:35:00.029
Caption: honestly Career Development I think

00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:02.010
Caption: needs a complete redesign through our

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:04.199
Caption: workplaces of the future but that is

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:05.639
Caption: much longer conversation and a whole

00:35:04.199 --> 00:35:06.989
Caption: talk in itself and I don&#39;t know all the

00:35:05.639 --> 00:35:08.539
Caption: answers but I think there&#39;s a huge

00:35:06.989 --> 00:35:11.189
Caption: amount of work that we need to do here

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:13.530
Caption: in the meantime though in order to be a

00:35:11.189 --> 00:35:15.439
Caption: best place to work you do need to have

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:17.760
Caption: clear transparent and objective

00:35:15.439 --> 00:35:21.300
Caption: processes so that people can have

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.380
Caption: control over their own career paths you

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.390
Caption: also need to make the salary

00:35:22.379 --> 00:35:27.419
Caption: conversations easier and more structured

00:35:24.389 --> 00:35:29.339
Caption: in a previous company we used to do

00:35:27.419 --> 00:35:30.719
Caption: reviews behind the scenes so we&#39;d have a

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.550
Caption: look at people&#39;s salaries and if there

00:35:30.719 --> 00:35:36.030
Caption: was people outside of market raid or

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:38.489
Caption: vans we would proactively contact them

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:39.810
Caption: and give them a salary review but what

00:35:38.489 --> 00:35:41.790
Caption: this man is if people weren&#39;t outside

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:44.459
Caption: the band&#39;s they didn&#39;t get a review

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.570
Caption: unless they come and asked us and we all

00:35:44.459 --> 00:35:47.729
Caption: know there&#39;s lots of stats that show

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:50.820
Caption: that women are less inclined to ask for

00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:52.260
Caption: salary reviews but in my experience a

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.760
Caption: lot of men that I&#39;ve worked with as well

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.649
Caption: especially you know if you might be a

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.810
Caption: little bit more introverted also don&#39;t

00:35:55.649 --> 00:36:01.469
Caption: like asking for those conversations so

00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:02.910
Caption: as a as a best place employer create an

00:36:01.469 --> 00:36:04.530
Caption: opportunity where everyone can have a

00:36:02.909 --> 00:36:06.209
Caption: conversation they know what&#39;s going to

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:07.890
Caption: happen and know when it can happen and

00:36:06.209 --> 00:36:09.479
Caption: make the conversation as easy as

00:36:07.889 --> 00:36:11.608
Caption: possible if you can provide them with

00:36:09.479 --> 00:36:13.108
Caption: you know some salary bans or some

00:36:11.608 --> 00:36:15.449
Caption: information to help them with the

00:36:13.108 --> 00:36:19.979
Caption: conversation make it easy for people and

00:36:15.449 --> 00:36:22.348
Caption: make it fair and it&#39;s not always about

00:36:19.979 --> 00:36:24.659
Caption: promotions it&#39;s often not about

00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:27.720
Caption: promotions actually it&#39;s about growing

00:36:24.659 --> 00:36:29.189
Caption: and developing so think about the way

00:36:27.719 --> 00:36:31.139
Caption: that you do performance reviews and

00:36:29.189 --> 00:36:34.108
Caption: rather than old-school meaningless

00:36:31.139 --> 00:36:37.260
Caption: performance reviews modernize it at

00:36:34.108 --> 00:36:39.209
Caption: ratify we use the retro process so most

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.399
Caption: of you have probably worked in agile and

00:36:39.209 --> 00:36:42.750
Caption: and know what retros are if you haven&#39;t

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:45.989
Caption: feel free to come and talk to anyone at

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:47.639
Caption: ratify or bank Quest or probably anyone

00:36:45.989 --> 00:36:50.829
Caption: or our

00:36:47.639 --> 00:36:53.889
Caption: so retro they&#39;re all about improving and

00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:55.900
Caption: learning and feedback so mate so we

00:36:53.889 --> 00:36:57.548
Caption: don&#39;t have a once-a-year performance

00:36:55.899 --> 00:36:58.959
Caption: review we just have retros as often as

00:36:57.549 --> 00:37:00.699
Caption: people want to do them so some people do

00:36:58.959 --> 00:37:02.469
Caption: them quarterly some people do them every

00:37:00.699 --> 00:37:09.639
Caption: six months and it&#39;s all about learning

00:37:02.469 --> 00:37:11.979
Caption: and improving and setting goals the last

00:37:09.639 --> 00:37:14.078
Caption: sort of main area from a leadership

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:40.390

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:42.010

Caption: well so it&#39;s a win-win for all of us and

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.219
Caption: then the last bit is creating a culture

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:59.530
Caption: of gratitude and shouting out great work

00:40:57.219 --> 00:41:01.300

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:03.189

Caption: quarterly or an annual award but more

00:41:08.229 --> 00:41:14.080
Caption: than that it needs to be more regular so

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.580
Caption: ratify we use a shout out wall

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:18.160
Caption: this is just a really easy way where

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:19.930
Caption: people can jump on and they can call out

00:41:18.159 --> 00:41:21.389

Caption: recognize teams as well and then it also

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:31.540
Caption: ties into an awards program and then we

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:33.040
Caption: can choose how often we give tangible

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:35.500
Caption: rewards out of that as the leadership

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:39.010
