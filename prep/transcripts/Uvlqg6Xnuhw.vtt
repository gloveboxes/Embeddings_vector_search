Caption: it&#39;s not necessarily anything that that

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:42.959
Caption: they&#39;ve done right but you still have

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.440
Caption: that experience your nervous system has

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:49.319
Caption: felt it you have the memory you see it

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.839
Caption: in your eye in your mind&#39;s eye right or

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.119
Caption: who&#39;s had this happen before

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:55.979
Caption: you&#39;re sitting around with your family

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:58.259
Caption: and you&#39;re telling a story

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.540
Caption: I do this four kids in my family so you

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.759
Caption: know we got lots of stories we get

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.559
Caption: together we start telling the story and

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.259
Caption: you&#39;re talking about how oh you know

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:09.419
Caption: remember that one time when mom sent me

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.160
Caption: down to the corner store and I had the

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.899
Caption: money in my hand and I was riding my

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.639
Caption: bike and I was going and then I fell off

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:17.339
Caption: the curb and like the coins went

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.899
Caption: everywhere and your brother goes hold on

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:21.419
Caption: that was me

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:23.699
Caption: I was the one who was with the money mom

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.979
Caption: sent me to the corner store I have the

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.600
Caption: scar on my knee to prove it like that&#39;s

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.639
Caption: that wasn&#39;t even you

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.639
Caption: right who&#39;s done that before

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:40.559
Caption: sometimes

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:44.279
Caption: we lock into these memories right we can

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:46.380
Caption: feel these stories we can drive this

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:49.199
Caption: narrative that&#39;s never even really

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.000
Caption: happened to us but we have this

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.940
Caption: experience

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.799
Caption: and so oftentimes our memories they&#39;ll

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.839
Caption: they&#39;ll drive a narrative to which we

00:05:55.799 --> 00:06:00.179
Caption: become emotionally attached and

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:02.639
Caption: sometimes these emotional attachments

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:05.519
Caption: they can hold us back

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.259
Caption: and when stressed we lock into the way

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:09.418
Caption: that we feel

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:13.259
Caption: starts to become supportive of that

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:16.380
Caption: stress more and more and more and the

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:18.839
Caption: more we reinforce that feeling the

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.820
Caption: deeper those memories they get locked

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:22.079
Caption: into our neural Pathways and we&#39;ll talk

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.779
Caption: a little bit more about that process

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:27.839
Caption: later but you know with lots of help

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:31.399
Caption: from highly trained professionals

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:34.859
Caption: I&#39;ve been able to learn how to navigate

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:37.739
Caption: stressful triggers by processing my

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:39.179
Caption: memories better and releasing emotional

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:42.500
Caption: attachments that are holding me back

00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:44.059
Caption: I&#39;ve learned to change the narrative

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.179
Caption: and

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:50.819
Caption: I&#39;ve learned to understand when my

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:54.660
Caption: memory is reliable when my memory is not

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:57.059
Caption: reliable and how it serves me regardless

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.500
Caption: of the accuracy so today I want to share

00:06:57.059 --> 00:07:01.319
Caption: some of that stuff that I&#39;ve learned

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.539
Caption: about improving brain performance and as

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:05.339

Caption: experience overcoming trauma and I&#39;m not

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:17.399
Caption: going to be talking about any of that

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.919
Caption: today but I&#39;ve come to realize that the

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:22.739
Caption: stories that I&#39;ve tell myself and others

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:26.098
Caption: they can either be the chains that bind

00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:28.679
Caption: me or they can be the keys that Release

00:07:26.098 --> 00:07:31.160

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:31.160

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:09.479
Caption: grew up in a teeny tiny little town in

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:11.399
Caption: the Midwest and in Michigan and I never

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:13.739
Caption: ever thought that I&#39;d be able to travel

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:15.839
Caption: to Australia in fact I dreamed about

00:08:13.739 --> 00:08:18.119
Caption: traveling to Australia when I was a kid

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:20.940
Caption: because it is the farthest way directly

00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:23.699
Caption: on the other side of the planet from

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.559
Caption: where I grew up and so this is amazing

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:28.020
Caption: to me to be delivering the opening

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:29.759
Caption: keynote at DDD Perth and I just want to

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:31.859

Caption: so

00:08:34.859 --> 00:08:39.958
Caption: so what

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:42.598
Caption: our memories they hold the key to better

00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:46.440
Caption: communication to emotional intelligence

00:08:42.598 --> 00:08:49.260
Caption: to being more open to the viewpoints of

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.838
Caption: others and for setting healthy

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.458
Caption: boundaries I just realized I&#39;m doing a

00:08:51.838 --> 00:08:55.278
Caption: lot of poses I&#39;m going to stand here for

00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:59.239
Caption: the rest of my talk because

00:08:55.278 --> 00:08:59.239
Caption: nobody&#39;s winning bingo today

00:08:59.359 --> 00:09:04.919
Caption: but you could see how as a brand

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.660
Caption: strategy consultant

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:09.599
Caption: um you know I&#39;m always looking for ways

00:09:06.659 --> 00:09:12.179
Caption: to connect products and services in

00:09:09.599 --> 00:09:14.039
Caption: meaningful ways to our end users and and

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:16.200
Caption: to our customers you can see how this

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:18.299
Caption: stuff would be important to me when I&#39;m

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.820
Caption: creating marketing funnels that have

00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:22.679
Caption: emotional triggers attached to them so

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.838
Caption: what is memory

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:26.458
Caption: it&#39;s a faculty by which the mine stores

00:09:24.838 --> 00:09:29.640
Caption: and remembers information something

00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:32.159
Caption: remembered from the past it is a

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.920
Caption: recollection which is really a way to

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:41.000
Caption: say you know memory is the process that

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:41.000
Caption: we use to encode store and retrieve data

00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:46.679
Caption: this affects our cognition that&#39;s how we

00:09:44.518 --> 00:09:50.579
Caption: think about things and also it affects

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:54.479
Caption: our Behavior how we respond our

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:57.360
Caption: observable responses and so our brains

00:09:54.479 --> 00:09:59.940
Caption: are constantly taking in data both

00:09:57.359 --> 00:10:02.398
Caption: internal and external we have all of

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.039
Caption: these stimuli and we&#39;re processing data

00:10:02.398 --> 00:10:06.299
Caption: in real time

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:08.759
Caption: based on all the new information that we

00:10:06.299 --> 00:10:11.338
Caption: take in mixed with the information

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.500
Caption: that&#39;s already in there right and so

00:10:11.338 --> 00:10:16.799
Caption: these days what we know as memory is

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:19.260
Caption: actually it&#39;s an interconnected group of

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:21.419
Caption: memory subsystems right we used to think

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:24.479
Caption: that there&#39;s left brain and right brain

00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:26.880
Caption: that&#39;s actually not how our brains work

00:10:24.479 --> 00:10:29.278
Caption: and these multiple memory systems

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.220
Caption: they&#39;re constantly processing data and

00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:35.239
Caption: they&#39;re able to function together or

00:10:32.219 --> 00:10:37.979
Caption: independently of each other

00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:40.739
Caption: so memories are weird

00:10:37.979 --> 00:10:43.380
Caption: memories can be compressed

00:10:40.739 --> 00:10:45.539
Caption: our brain has this quality where you

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.660
Caption: know if the stimulus is the same over

00:10:45.539 --> 00:10:49.979
Caption: and over again our memories will just

00:10:48.659 --> 00:10:52.739
Caption: compress it because it&#39;s the same day

00:10:49.979 --> 00:10:55.500
Caption: who&#39;s done this recently when you said I

00:10:52.739 --> 00:10:57.479
Caption: do this oh yeah last time you were over

00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:00.059
Caption: my house for dinner six months ago and

00:10:57.479 --> 00:11:02.578
Caption: we did board games and we did

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:03.958
Caption: no Christina that was a year and six

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:06.179
Caption: months ago

00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:09.059
Caption: because everybody&#39;s living been living

00:11:06.179 --> 00:11:12.059
Caption: the same day over and over and over and

00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:14.039
Caption: over again because of covid and so our

00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:16.500
Caption: brain has this quality for efficiency

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:19.380
Caption: that it just compresses the memories

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:23.099
Caption: right and so remember it&#39;s our emotions

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:25.018
Caption: that that drive that narrative for our

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:27.359
Caption: memories and so even though we can&#39;t

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:29.458
Caption: give our brain more processing power

00:11:27.359 --> 00:11:32.099
Caption: like like we can for our machines we can

00:11:29.458 --> 00:11:34.018
Caption: just insert some more processing power

00:11:32.099 --> 00:11:36.359
Caption: into our computers we can&#39;t do that for

00:11:34.018 --> 00:11:39.059
Caption: our brains but we can

00:11:36.359 --> 00:11:41.039
Caption: we can look for unconscious biases we

00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:43.320
Caption: can look for inefficient processes in

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:44.479
Caption: our brains and we can actually with

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.338
Caption: practice

00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:49.919
Caption: improve our brain performance so I&#39;m

00:11:47.338 --> 00:11:52.140
Caption: going to uh share with you some of the

00:11:49.919 --> 00:11:54.838
Caption: ways that our brains might fail us and

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.220
Caption: ways that we can improve our memories

00:11:54.838 --> 00:11:58.619
Caption: today and I&#39;m not saying that you know

00:11:56.219 --> 00:12:02.039
Caption: you can completely forget things or

00:11:58.619 --> 00:12:04.320
Caption: that&#39;ll Erase Away things but we can

00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:06.359
Caption: improve how we process things this has

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.398
Caption: especially been helpful for my mentees

00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:10.739
Caption: for my coaching clients who are going

00:12:08.398 --> 00:12:12.659
Caption: through long covid right who&#39;s been

00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:15.000
Caption: experiencing a lot of brain fog in the

00:12:12.659 --> 00:12:18.778
Caption: past couple of years that is a real

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.119
Caption: issue and so if you can just focus on

00:12:18.778 --> 00:12:23.099
Caption: one of these techniques for three months

00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:25.260
Caption: and then move on to the next one then

00:12:23.099 --> 00:12:26.338
Caption: okay cool I&#39;m going to share with you a

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.500
Caption: whole lot of techniques that I&#39;ve

00:12:26.338 --> 00:12:31.320
Caption: learned and been practicing in the last

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:34.219
Caption: four years it&#39;s been really cool

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.220
Caption: check this out

00:12:34.619 --> 00:12:39.239
Caption: So today we&#39;re going to talk about these

00:12:36.359 --> 00:12:41.760
Caption: types of memory systems we&#39;re going to

00:12:39.239 --> 00:12:45.059
Caption: talk about the biological storage about

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:48.778
Caption: improving daily performance about your

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:51.659
Caption: confidence so for an example if you are

00:12:48.778 --> 00:12:53.820
Caption: if you are if you&#39;re starting for a new

00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:56.940
Caption: job right if you&#39;re starting a new job

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:59.458
Caption: and you get to introduce yourself to

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.880
Caption: people around the office you want people

00:12:59.458 --> 00:13:04.440
Caption: to observe you

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.440
Caption: recognizing other people&#39;s names and

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:09.119
Caption: having that memory and holding on to

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.338
Caption: other people&#39;s names because then you

00:13:09.119 --> 00:13:12.539
Caption: appear more confident and so that is a

00:13:11.338 --> 00:13:14.458
Caption: quality that&#39;s going to be more

00:13:12.539 --> 00:13:16.138
Caption: beneficial to you right

00:13:14.458 --> 00:13:17.458
Caption: emotional intelligence we&#39;re going to

00:13:16.138 --> 00:13:19.018
Caption: talk about that a little bit I could

00:13:17.458 --> 00:13:21.419
Caption: talk about that all day but we don&#39;t

00:13:19.018 --> 00:13:24.479
Caption: have all day and then you know conflict

00:13:21.419 --> 00:13:27.479
Caption: conflict is inevitable and so there is a

00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:29.159
Caption: one-way a extreme way to respond to a

00:13:27.479 --> 00:13:32.638
Caption: situation and there&#39;s another extreme

00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:35.039
Caption: way to respond to a situation I kind of

00:13:32.638 --> 00:13:38.278
Caption: try to waver around the middle so that

00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:39.898
Caption: when we have informed choices to choose

00:13:38.278 --> 00:13:42.719
Caption: from then we&#39;re going to pick the best

00:13:39.898 --> 00:13:46.200
Caption: possible response to get the best

00:13:42.719 --> 00:13:48.059
Caption: possible results in a situation

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.160
Caption: so by Rick and ebbinghaus they&#39;re the

00:13:48.059 --> 00:13:52.440
Caption: ones who conducted This research in 1984

00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:54.539
Caption: and they found that most of the

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.979
Caption: forgetting happens between the ages of

00:13:54.539 --> 00:13:58.440
Caption: four to five that&#39;s when our memory

00:13:55.979 --> 00:14:00.419
Caption: subsystems start to develop and we have

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.458
Caption: two of them declarative and

00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:05.039
Caption: non-declarative so we have a different

00:14:02.458 --> 00:14:08.278
Caption: memory subsystem for for memorializing

00:14:05.039 --> 00:14:10.259
Caption: like algebraic formulas for example or

00:14:08.278 --> 00:14:12.958
Caption: or a different memory subsystem for

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.578
Caption: doing on the spot math right in fact

00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.679
Caption: there&#39;s this quality called memory

00:14:14.578 --> 00:14:20.159
Caption: consolidation who&#39;s heard of that before

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:24.119
Caption: memory consolidation it&#39;s when you go to

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:26.699
Caption: sleep right and you get the benefit of

00:14:24.119 --> 00:14:29.398
Caption: consolidating your memories and and it

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.919
Caption: really strengthens those neural Pathways

00:14:29.398 --> 00:14:34.619
Caption: and synaptic connections between the

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:38.179
Caption: neurons structurally and chemically that

00:14:34.619 --> 00:14:38.179
Caption: is called memory consolidation

00:14:38.518 --> 00:14:43.078
Caption: our declarative memory

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:45.359
Caption: it&#39;s your conscious memory

00:14:43.078 --> 00:14:47.638
Caption: it involves effort involves intention

00:14:45.359 --> 00:14:50.099
Caption: and so we can use intentional techniques

00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:53.518
Caption: we do tests we do aptitude tests we do

00:14:50.099 --> 00:14:54.198
Caption: the LSAT for attorneys we we do certain

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:56.880
Caption: um

00:14:54.198 --> 00:14:59.338
Caption: mnemonics or repetition right and

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.500
Caption: biologically it&#39;s the hippocampus that

00:14:59.338 --> 00:15:03.419
Caption: and the frontal lobes that manage this

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.518
Caption: part of our memory the declarative

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:07.979
Caption: memory system it can be measured with

00:15:05.518 --> 00:15:09.539
Caption: those explicit tests so check this out

00:15:07.979 --> 00:15:11.278
Caption: these are the three different types that

00:15:09.539 --> 00:15:13.919
Caption: we have we have working memory and

00:15:11.278 --> 00:15:16.518
Caption: people who struggle with ADHD usually

00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:19.320
Caption: this is the type of memory subsystem

00:15:16.518 --> 00:15:22.859
Caption: that is challenged most for them because

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:25.500
Caption: you only have two to 18 seconds for the

00:15:22.859 --> 00:15:27.599
Caption: old information to collide with the new

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.479
Caption: information and then you process it

00:15:27.599 --> 00:15:31.619
Caption: right the the biological part of your

00:15:30.479 --> 00:15:34.859
Caption: brain

00:15:31.619 --> 00:15:38.099
Caption: uh vasopressin is the ability to to help

00:15:34.859 --> 00:15:39.958
Caption: you take in that new information and

00:15:38.099 --> 00:15:42.479
Caption: then we have episodic memory episodic

00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:43.679
Caption: memory this is our long-term memory

00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:45.958
Caption: system

00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:49.198
Caption: um but it&#39;s about specific life events

00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:52.739
Caption: right this is where we we store our our

00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:54.719
Caption: wedding day memories that one time when

00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:57.778
Caption: Christina all done gave an amazing

00:15:54.719 --> 00:16:00.599
Caption: keynote at DDD Perth wow right these

00:15:57.778 --> 00:16:02.338
Caption: episodic memories when you&#39;re riding

00:16:00.599 --> 00:16:04.380
Caption: your bike and you&#39;re holding on to the

00:16:02.338 --> 00:16:06.440
Caption: coins and then your bike falls and the

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:09.119
Caption: coins go everywhere

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.979
Caption: episodic memory subsystem is where that

00:16:09.119 --> 00:16:13.559
Caption: is stored and then we have our semantic

00:16:10.979 --> 00:16:16.260
Caption: memory subsystem and you know this is

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:19.260
Caption: general knowledge this is two plus two

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:22.559
Caption: is four right the capital of loss of

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:26.160
Caption: Nevada is Carson City the the factual

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:30.179
Caption: general knowledge if I have a red ball

00:16:26.159 --> 00:16:32.159
Caption: in my hand and I decide to fulling it

00:16:30.179 --> 00:16:36.479
Caption: all the way to the back of the room take

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:38.940
Caption: that speaker pose bingo I have the Red

00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:42.119
Caption: Bull and maybe for your semantic memory

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:45.299
Caption: maybe you see it okay did she throw it

00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:47.758
Caption: yes was the ball red General factual

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:50.338
Caption: information there&#39;s no narrative or

00:16:47.758 --> 00:16:53.458
Caption: emotion attached to it what happens when

00:16:50.338 --> 00:16:56.039
Caption: we start attaching a memory to it that&#39;s

00:16:53.458 --> 00:16:57.000
Caption: a a narrative to it that&#39;s a little bit

00:16:56.039 --> 00:16:59.518
Caption: different

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.559
Caption: oh my gosh did you see Christina Wing

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:04.678
Caption: that ball right past my head she almost

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:06.958
Caption: hit me what a jerk right that&#39;s a

00:17:04.678 --> 00:17:09.539
Caption: totally different memory subsystem

00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:12.178
Caption: semantic memory only works with the

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:14.280
Caption: general knowledge

00:17:12.178 --> 00:17:16.438
Caption: then there&#39;s non-declarative memory this

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.660
Caption: is your unconscious memory it is

00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:22.198
Caption: inherently there it&#39;s automatically

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:24.660
Caption: there your biases instantly are there

00:17:22.198 --> 00:17:27.359
Caption: and it requires zero effort it&#39;s

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:29.400
Caption: unintentional right biologically this is

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:32.640
Caption: our cortical areas of our brain the

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:35.219
Caption: cerebellum the basal ganglia they&#39;re the

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.859
Caption: ones that govern the non-declarative

00:17:35.219 --> 00:17:40.199
Caption: memory subsystem and so this is really

00:17:37.859 --> 00:17:42.839
Caption: imperative for forming new memories

00:17:40.199 --> 00:17:43.979
Caption: you&#39;ll see if people have amnesia and

00:17:42.839 --> 00:17:45.719
Caption: they&#39;re they&#39;re struggling with that

00:17:43.979 --> 00:17:47.579
Caption: usually they have maybe damage to their

00:17:45.719 --> 00:17:51.780
Caption: cerebellum or something like that and so

00:17:47.579 --> 00:17:54.000
Caption: people can can improve by even you know

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.739
Caption: focusing on activities that are going to

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.479
Caption: stimulate the basal ganglia the cortical

00:17:55.739 --> 00:18:00.418
Caption: areas the cerebellum and now of course

00:17:57.479 --> 00:18:02.520
Caption: there are three different memory

00:18:00.418 --> 00:18:05.819
Caption: subsystems priming our memory we can

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:07.320
Caption: prime our memory by repetition there are

00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:10.199
Caption: certain things like

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:12.899
Caption: um you can prime your memory with a

00:18:10.199 --> 00:18:16.319
Caption: perfume right you&#39;re at you&#39;re at the

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:18.719
Caption: grocery and you go walk by little old

00:18:16.319 --> 00:18:19.859
Caption: grandma comes by and oh she smells like

00:18:18.719 --> 00:18:22.020
Caption: your little grandma because she&#39;s

00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:24.719
Caption: wearing that same perfume we can prime

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.959
Caption: our memory with those kinds of things

00:18:24.719 --> 00:18:30.119
Caption: and then we also have conditioning

00:18:26.959 --> 00:18:32.099
Caption: conditioning is like Pavlov&#39;s dog

00:18:30.119 --> 00:18:34.918
Caption: who&#39;s heard of Pablo&#39;s dog here most

00:18:32.099 --> 00:18:37.500
Caption: everybody right he rang the bell he fed

00:18:34.918 --> 00:18:40.019
Caption: the dog the dog would salivate ring the

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.780
Caption: bell feed the dog dog would salivate

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:45.000
Caption: pretty soon all he had to do is

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:48.000
Caption: ring the bell that&#39;s it and the dog

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.699
Caption: would salivate exactly and so we can

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.099
Caption: condition our brain patterns through

00:18:50.699 --> 00:18:56.399
Caption: things like neuro-linguistic programming

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:59.280
Caption: or through hypnosis certain techniques

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.260
Caption: that will help improve your condition

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.739
Caption: brain and then we have our motor

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:06.119
Caption: procedural memory this is a physical

00:19:03.739 --> 00:19:08.699
Caption: repetition over and over and over again

00:19:06.119 --> 00:19:12.058
Caption: hitting a baseball hitting a golf ball

00:19:08.699 --> 00:19:17.099
Caption: dribbling a basketball these are motor

00:19:12.058 --> 00:19:21.359
Caption: procedural memory subsystem stimuli

00:19:17.099 --> 00:19:23.640
Caption: so when these different subsystems are

00:19:21.359 --> 00:19:27.058
Caption: stimulated right they start encoding

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:29.339
Caption: storing and retrieving data together and

00:19:27.058 --> 00:19:31.619
Caption: sometimes not together sometimes a

00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:33.239
Caption: memory subsystem will be isolated from

00:19:31.619 --> 00:19:35.099
Caption: the other one and it won&#39;t be activated

00:19:33.239 --> 00:19:38.660
Caption: so for example it&#39;s taking it let&#39;s say

00:19:35.099 --> 00:19:38.660
Caption: you&#39;re taking a math final hmm

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.440
Caption: all right we&#39;ve learned semantic memory

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:47.099
Caption: is going to store that formula right

00:19:43.439 --> 00:19:49.079
Caption: General factual knowledge cool all right

00:19:47.099 --> 00:19:54.900
Caption: but then you sit down to take your math

00:19:49.079 --> 00:19:54.899
Caption: final and your brain goes uh

00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:00.959
Caption: somehow your short-term memory there is

00:19:58.619 --> 00:20:03.599
Caption: not giving you access either maybe you

00:20:00.959 --> 00:20:05.038
Caption: have an amygdala hijack and you&#39;re just

00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:06.599
Caption: like panicking and you&#39;re freaking out

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:08.459
Caption: because you&#39;re not a person who takes

00:20:06.599 --> 00:20:11.880
Caption: tests really well maybe like I said

00:20:08.459 --> 00:20:13.798
Caption: maybe you have uh ADHD right and so that

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.359
Caption: that new information is colliding with

00:20:13.798 --> 00:20:17.399
Caption: the old information and it&#39;s just

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:20.459
Caption: they&#39;re hitting a wall and it&#39;s not

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.260
Caption: happening right and so maybe

00:20:20.459 --> 00:20:24.058
Caption: um this this is you&#39;re having a panic

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.979
Caption: attack this is this is a real thing for

00:20:24.058 --> 00:20:28.140
Caption: a lot of people right

00:20:25.979 --> 00:20:29.880
Caption: um and then on top of that maybe you&#39;re

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:33.058
Caption: suffering from the effects of of long

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:35.699
Caption: covid or maybe you&#39;re more of an

00:20:33.058 --> 00:20:38.279
Caption: auditory learner and processor when it

00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:40.639
Caption: comes to math maybe you&#39;re more of a

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:44.160
Caption: visual learner and process

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:46.799
Caption: visual uh cues when it comes to math

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:49.140
Caption: maybe you&#39;re more of an associative

00:20:46.798 --> 00:20:50.760
Caption: learner right maybe you got to have your

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.678
Caption: favorite conference hoodie when you do

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:54.719
Caption: your math test because guess what it&#39;s

00:20:52.678 --> 00:20:57.119
Caption: my lucky hoodie and we see this with

00:20:54.719 --> 00:20:58.798
Caption: sport hurts people right we see this all

00:20:57.119 --> 00:21:01.439
Caption: the time everybody&#39;s got to have their

00:20:58.798 --> 00:21:03.418
Caption: lucky hoodie they&#39;re not going to shave

00:21:01.439 --> 00:21:05.219
Caption: my beard because it&#39;s lucky I&#39;m not

00:21:03.418 --> 00:21:07.979
Caption: going to cut my hair whatever that is

00:21:05.219 --> 00:21:11.400
Caption: but they&#39;re more associative and so

00:21:07.979 --> 00:21:12.900
Caption: that&#39;s how they perform best

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.099
Caption: right

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:17.039
Caption: there are a lot of different Pro

00:21:14.099 --> 00:21:20.520
Caption: approaches and the goal is to get your

00:21:17.038 --> 00:21:23.699
Caption: brain to organize it information in a

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.619
Caption: way that is Optimum for you and guess

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:27.659
Caption: what there are 7.9 billion different

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:30.658
Caption: ways to do that ladies and gentlemen so

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.979
Caption: it&#39;s amazing that anything gets done at

00:21:30.659 --> 00:21:34.460
Caption: all in fact we were talking about that

00:21:31.979 --> 00:21:34.459
Caption: last night

00:21:35.339 --> 00:21:41.819
Caption: but here&#39;s the thing brains they lie

00:21:39.479 --> 00:21:44.339
Caption: right brains Lies We heard in the

00:21:41.819 --> 00:21:48.058
Caption: beginning of of my talk brains light and

00:21:44.339 --> 00:21:51.779
Caption: the more rigid our beliefs are the more

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:54.779
Caption: distracted we are the more our brains

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:58.859
Caption: are going to lie and if you talk to

00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:01.739
Caption: police at a scene they will say that

00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:04.199
Caption: eyewitness accounts are not accurate

00:22:01.739 --> 00:22:06.178
Caption: they can interview 20 different people

00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:09.178
Caption: who are all right there and you&#39;re going

00:22:06.178 --> 00:22:11.760
Caption: to get 20 different answers because

00:22:09.178 --> 00:22:13.859
Caption: again there&#39;s 7.9 billion different ways

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.780
Caption: to process those data and that

00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:17.780
Caption: information right so for example

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:23.760
Caption: our brains can create false memories if

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:26.580
Caption: you are a person who struggles with

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.678
Caption: connecting with others and I mean

00:22:26.579 --> 00:22:32.219
Caption: I mean this is a real thing for a lot of

00:22:28.678 --> 00:22:34.380
Caption: people they deeply want connection and

00:22:32.219 --> 00:22:35.699
Caption: crave connection but are unable to for

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.579
Caption: whatever reason

00:22:35.699 --> 00:22:41.099
Caption: find it maybe you&#39;re sitting at home and

00:22:38.579 --> 00:22:44.939
Caption: you&#39;re thinking about that

00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:46.918
Caption: maybe you start ruminating a little bit

00:22:44.939 --> 00:22:49.558
Caption: maybe you start feeling a little bit

00:22:46.918 --> 00:22:53.819
Caption: from a victim mindset

00:22:49.558 --> 00:22:56.699
Caption: maybe you start recalling past memories

00:22:53.819 --> 00:22:59.038
Caption: through that victim mindset you can

00:22:56.699 --> 00:23:01.500
Caption: actually create

00:22:59.038 --> 00:23:05.759
Caption: false memories from that

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:09.538
Caption: and that narrative starts to drive how

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:12.599
Caption: you operate that narrative starts to

00:23:09.538 --> 00:23:15.239
Caption: really shift how you see the world and

00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:17.158
Caption: create these false memories and you know

00:23:15.239 --> 00:23:20.400
Caption: our brains are totally capable of this

00:23:17.159 --> 00:23:22.740
Caption: in cases of extreme trauma even your

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.359
Caption: brain might dissociate from the memories

00:23:22.739 --> 00:23:26.339
Caption: altogether

00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:28.859
Caption: so here&#39;s a perfect example let&#39;s say

00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:30.779
Caption: you went to go see the new Avengers

00:23:28.859 --> 00:23:33.538
Caption: movie I guess it&#39;s the doctor strange

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.500
Caption: one is that the ones come on

00:23:33.538 --> 00:23:36.058
Caption: um

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.479
Caption: you go to see the new adventures movie

00:23:36.058 --> 00:23:40.859

Caption: had such a great time there were

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:06.780
Caption: explosions the whole multi-universe

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:08.640
Caption: thing I mean it was so awesome enjoy

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:11.219
Caption: sitting there going

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.780
Caption: you&#39;re kidding right

00:24:11.219 --> 00:24:15.239
Caption: it was me

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.979
Caption: I was there I was there with you and

00:24:15.239 --> 00:24:19.678
Caption: here&#39;s the thing it&#39;s not that you did

00:24:16.979 --> 00:24:22.439
Caption: it on purpose right gosh I love joy I

00:24:19.678 --> 00:24:24.719
Caption: love John like we&#39;re all friends no it&#39;s

00:24:22.439 --> 00:24:27.119
Caption: just that your focus

00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:29.760
Caption: was on the movie itself and so your

00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:31.380
Caption: brain just kind of fills in the the

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.479
Caption: friend spot I&#39;ve totally done this

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.619
Caption: before by the way it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not

00:24:33.479 --> 00:24:36.959
Caption: awesome

00:24:34.619 --> 00:24:39.239
Caption: um but the you can you could totally

00:24:36.959 --> 00:24:41.520
Caption: create these these false memories your

00:24:39.239 --> 00:24:42.959
Caption: brain is is perfectly capable about that

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.640
Caption: of that

00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:45.959
Caption: interruptions I want to say a quick

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.099
Caption: thing about interruptions because we

00:24:45.959 --> 00:24:50.099
Caption: have retroactive and proactive

00:24:47.099 --> 00:24:52.380
Caption: interference and I use this as a tool so

00:24:50.099 --> 00:24:53.819
Caption: interruptions I work from home I am a

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.859
Caption: consultant when my kids come running

00:24:53.819 --> 00:24:59.579
Caption: into my office they go hey Mom can I run

00:24:55.859 --> 00:25:01.260
Caption: today I go just a minute

00:24:59.579 --> 00:25:03.418
Caption: I give them one of those right because

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:05.219
Caption: interruptions are the number one reason

00:25:03.418 --> 00:25:07.380
Caption: that we forget and it&#39;s the same thing

00:25:05.219 --> 00:25:09.780
Caption: when we work in big open offices it&#39;s

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:12.058
Caption: the same thing when somebody runs in now

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.520
Caption: there&#39;s nothing wrong with this what

00:25:12.058 --> 00:25:16.678
Caption: this does is it gives you a pause to

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.260
Caption: finish up the email to finish up the

00:25:16.678 --> 00:25:21.839
Caption: thing to finish up the text thread hold

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:24.000
Caption: on get in line you&#39;re number three let

00:25:21.839 --> 00:25:26.219
Caption: me just wrap these up right

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.159
Caption: in fact if you communicate with people

00:25:26.219 --> 00:25:30.599
Caption: it&#39;s they&#39;re going to actually

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:32.220
Caption: appreciate and respect your boundaries

00:25:30.599 --> 00:25:35.219
Caption: and they&#39;re not going to start running

00:25:32.219 --> 00:25:36.538
Caption: into your office as much so and you

00:25:35.219 --> 00:25:38.640
Caption: could you could just you know just one

00:25:36.538 --> 00:25:40.139
Caption: let me just finish this up real quick I

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.959
Caption: have a thought let me finish it up

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:45.058
Caption: because you know what if you don&#39;t

00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:47.520
Caption: it&#39;s gone

00:25:45.058 --> 00:25:50.158
Caption: the interruption has to be significant

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:53.099
Caption: enough in order for you to forget it

00:25:50.159 --> 00:25:54.360
Caption: though so if it&#39;s really fast and my

00:25:53.099 --> 00:25:56.099

Caption: you&#39;re not going to lose that because

00:26:30.538 --> 00:26:36.239
Caption: interruptions are the number one reason

00:26:32.819 --> 00:26:40.439
Caption: why we forget take the look here look at

00:26:36.239 --> 00:26:42.000
Caption: this what you see is not always what you

00:26:40.439 --> 00:26:43.918
Caption: get

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.260
Caption: what you see is not always what you get

00:26:43.918 --> 00:26:49.019
Caption: remember what I said eyewitness accounts

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:51.119
Caption: are not accurate they are not dependable

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.919
Caption: and if you ask 20 different people that

00:26:51.119 --> 00:26:54.959
Caption: have seen you&#39;re going to get 20

00:26:52.918 --> 00:26:56.639
Caption: different answers this has been proved

00:26:54.959 --> 00:26:58.439
Caption: over and over again replicated in

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.020
Caption: Laboratories and research all over the

00:26:58.439 --> 00:27:02.298
Caption: planet that we cannot always trust our

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.859
Caption: memories because

00:27:02.298 --> 00:27:07.079
Caption: brains lie so how can we improve our

00:27:04.859 --> 00:27:08.880
Caption: memory it&#39;s totally possible we can

00:27:07.079 --> 00:27:11.819
Caption: improve our memory we can improve our

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:14.760
Caption: capacity for Learning and we can improve

00:27:11.819 --> 00:27:17.579
Caption: our ability to encode store and retrieve

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.678
Caption: data this is how we do it we used to

00:27:17.579 --> 00:27:21.178
Caption: think that our brains were so much more

00:27:19.678 --> 00:27:23.158
Caption: limited

00:27:21.178 --> 00:27:24.538
Caption: eight nine ten years ago we didn&#39;t know

00:27:23.159 --> 00:27:27.299
Caption: anything about the brain we used to say

00:27:24.538 --> 00:27:29.339
Caption: you can&#39;t teach an old dog new tricks

00:27:27.298 --> 00:27:31.678
Caption: who said that before

00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:33.658
Caption: stop saying that

00:27:31.678 --> 00:27:35.819
Caption: it&#39;s not true

00:27:33.659 --> 00:27:37.740
Caption: in fact you can teach an old dog new

00:27:35.819 --> 00:27:41.158
Caption: tricks in fact you can start creating

00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:44.640
Caption: new neural Pathways as early as five to

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:47.039
Caption: six hours your brain will start rewiring

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.919
Caption: it&#39;s pretty cool if the stimulus is

00:27:47.038 --> 00:27:53.339
Caption: strong enough or repetitive enough

00:27:49.918 --> 00:27:55.979
Caption: we can rewire our brain I know this I am

00:27:53.339 --> 00:27:57.839
Caption: a living proof of this as somebody who

00:27:55.979 --> 00:28:00.119
Caption: has overcome trauma as somebody who at

00:27:57.839 --> 00:28:03.058
Caption: one point was even catatonic for nine

00:28:00.119 --> 00:28:05.640
Caption: days straight I did not speak

00:28:03.058 --> 00:28:08.819
Caption: these are the ways that I have learned

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.859
Caption: to improve my brain performance and I

00:28:08.819 --> 00:28:14.099
Caption: use it with my mentees my Consultants my

00:28:10.859 --> 00:28:16.020
Caption: coaching clients everybody and it&#39;s

00:28:14.099 --> 00:28:19.500
Caption: really really cool so this is

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:21.539
Caption: neuroplasticity in action right so if we

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.819
Caption: strengthen that neural pathway and we

00:28:21.538 --> 00:28:26.519
Caption: stimulate it over and over and over

00:28:23.819 --> 00:28:27.719
Caption: again then we start to learn things if

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:33.058
Caption: the stimulus is strong enough or

00:28:27.719 --> 00:28:33.058
Caption: repetitive enough it will stick also

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:42.600
Caption: if we stop the stimulus

00:28:39.178 --> 00:28:43.918
Caption: those neural Pathways will dissolve

00:28:42.599 --> 00:28:46.140
Caption: right

00:28:43.918 --> 00:28:47.639
Caption: so think about it it makes sense that

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.279
Caption: just reading a book about emotional

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:52.619
Caption: intelligence or memory it&#39;s it&#39;s not

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:54.960
Caption: going to instantly improve you have to

00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:57.959
Caption: actually practice these things over and

00:28:54.959 --> 00:28:59.939
Caption: over and over again or the stimulus has

00:28:57.959 --> 00:29:02.939
Caption: to be strong enough ladies and gentlemen

00:28:59.939 --> 00:29:06.000
Caption: imagine teeny tiny little Christina I

00:29:02.939 --> 00:29:08.038
Caption: take you back you know 40 some years ago

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.959
Caption: crawling around the floor of my

00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:12.599
Caption: grandmother&#39;s house and in the US we

00:29:09.959 --> 00:29:14.640
Caption: have um we have won 10 volts but you

00:29:12.599 --> 00:29:17.579
Caption: know what this this I I think you get

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.440
Caption: the picture we are uh looking at me

00:29:17.579 --> 00:29:20.880
Caption: crawling around my grandmother&#39;s house

00:29:19.439 --> 00:29:22.379
Caption: and I pick up one of those metal

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.899
Caption: hairpins

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:28.039
Caption: and it happens to be the perfect size

00:29:24.899 --> 00:29:28.039
Caption: for just

00:29:28.619 --> 00:29:34.558
Caption: crying and crying oh my gosh

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.000
Caption: it bit me it bit me right my mom had no

00:29:34.558 --> 00:29:38.038
Caption: idea what bitter because we didn&#39;t have

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.880
Caption: dogs we didn&#39;t like what was it what bit

00:29:38.038 --> 00:29:43.500
Caption: her I had no no it bit me and then she

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:47.940
Caption: realized that I&#39;d stick the bobby pin

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:49.798
Caption: into the socket how many times do you

00:29:47.939 --> 00:29:51.918
Caption: think I stimulated that neural pathway

00:29:49.798 --> 00:29:53.459
Caption: in my life

00:29:51.918 --> 00:29:56.519
Caption: once

00:29:53.459 --> 00:29:58.558
Caption: once that was all that was needed for me

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:01.500
Caption: to learn the lesson if the stimulus is

00:29:58.558 --> 00:30:04.158
Caption: strong enough or repetitive enough you

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:06.359
Caption: will remember it and also

00:30:04.159 --> 00:30:09.899
Caption: neuroplasticity just as we will remember

00:30:06.359 --> 00:30:12.178
Caption: it we can forget it so my French teacher

00:30:09.899 --> 00:30:13.919
Caption: used to say if you don&#39;t use it

00:30:12.178 --> 00:30:16.019
Caption: you lose it

00:30:13.918 --> 00:30:18.798
Caption: that&#39;s why the only thing I can say in

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.799
Caption: French is

00:30:19.859 --> 00:30:26.418
Caption: are you a tie

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.418
Caption: it&#39;s completely useless I don&#39;t know

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:32.880
Caption: three years of French it&#39;s unbelievable

00:30:29.159 --> 00:30:36.539
Caption: and so we we went through the different

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:39.298
Caption: kinds of memory subsystems we we talked

00:30:36.538 --> 00:30:41.819
Caption: about the the value of neuroplasticity

00:30:39.298 --> 00:30:43.918
Caption: we talked about how

00:30:41.819 --> 00:30:46.859
Caption: um memories can be false let&#39;s talk a

00:30:43.918 --> 00:30:49.019
Caption: little bit about how we can process our

00:30:46.859 --> 00:30:51.658
Caption: memories

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:54.058
Caption: we have shallow processing superficial

00:30:51.659 --> 00:30:56.700
Caption: or deep where we have that purpose

00:30:54.058 --> 00:30:58.739
Caption: attached to the data when we have

00:30:56.699 --> 00:31:01.019
Caption: something that&#39;s meaningful to us now

00:30:58.739 --> 00:31:02.699
Caption: remember there are 7.9 billion different

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.859
Caption: ways to do this and that means

00:31:02.699 --> 00:31:07.079
Caption: introverts and extroverts are going to

00:31:04.859 --> 00:31:10.020
Caption: respond to the same stimuli in a

00:31:07.079 --> 00:31:12.058
Caption: different way if you are in teams we

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.279
Caption: need to understand this and we need to

00:31:12.058 --> 00:31:16.678
Caption: take this into consideration uh

00:31:14.279 --> 00:31:19.440
Caption: devnikima put up a really great Twitter

00:31:16.678 --> 00:31:21.000
Caption: post that she said I could use as we

00:31:19.439 --> 00:31:23.699
Caption: were putting as I was putting my talk

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.739
Caption: together front load the data

00:31:23.699 --> 00:31:28.260
Caption: front load me with information give me

00:31:25.739 --> 00:31:30.899
Caption: time to process and respond I&#39;m not an

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:32.880
Caption: on-the-spot thinker but give me time to

00:31:30.899 --> 00:31:34.799
Caption: be thoughtful and it&#39;s worth the wait

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:37.440
Caption: give me reference material make

00:31:34.798 --> 00:31:39.239
Caption: asynchronous collaboration possible my

00:31:37.439 --> 00:31:42.719
Caption: brain&#39;s not always lit up and ready for

00:31:39.239 --> 00:31:44.760
Caption: output allow me to communicate in text

00:31:42.719 --> 00:31:46.619
Caption: that&#39;s a big one for me that&#39;s a really

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.058
Caption: big one for me because is anybody else

00:31:46.619 --> 00:31:51.359
Caption: really good like you go home and you&#39;re

00:31:48.058 --> 00:31:53.579
Caption: like oh I should have totally said this

00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:55.079
Caption: oh that&#39;s smart ass I should have gave

00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:56.939
Caption: him that dig and I would have really

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:59.880
Caption: right

00:31:56.939 --> 00:32:01.739
Caption: oh I had the perfect response four days

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.000
Caption: later like the other person&#39;s not even

00:32:01.739 --> 00:32:04.739
Caption: thinking about the conversation anymore

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.779
Caption: you know

00:32:04.739 --> 00:32:09.599
Caption: real-time meetings are allowed to

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:11.520
Caption: process at once and I&#39;m already short on

00:32:09.599 --> 00:32:13.319
Caption: working memory I&#39;m probably bored and

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.520
Caption: it&#39;s taking everything I have just to

00:32:13.319 --> 00:32:16.558
Caption: stay focused and listen for

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.799
Caption: understanding this is especially true

00:32:16.558 --> 00:32:23.398
Caption: during covid times here is a summary of

00:32:19.798 --> 00:32:25.619
Caption: what dev nakima has to say

00:32:23.399 --> 00:32:28.799
Caption: understanding this it helps us support

00:32:25.619 --> 00:32:31.678
Caption: everyone on the team so that everyone

00:32:28.798 --> 00:32:34.079
Caption: can perform better on the job if you are

00:32:31.678 --> 00:32:36.719
Caption: going to come right out of the gate hey

00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:38.459
Caption: everybody all right let&#39;s go let&#39;s get

00:32:36.719 --> 00:32:40.979
Caption: this meeting started right extroverts

00:32:38.459 --> 00:32:42.119
Caption: are going to go yeah let&#39;s go this is

00:32:40.979 --> 00:32:44.398
Caption: awesome

00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:46.380
Caption: I got ideas we&#39;re gonna start talking

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:48.000
Caption: over each other oh I got some creative

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:50.339
Caption: things let&#39;s go and all of those

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.659
Caption: introverts are gonna go

00:32:50.339 --> 00:32:54.500
Caption: yes it&#39;s going to be one of those

00:32:51.659 --> 00:32:54.500
Caption: meetings again

00:32:56.719 --> 00:33:02.339
Caption: I&#39;m gonna check out

00:33:00.119 --> 00:33:06.260
Caption: I&#39;m gonna sit back

00:33:02.339 --> 00:33:06.260
Caption: and quietly resent you

00:33:06.779 --> 00:33:11.760
Caption: and they&#39;re gonna wait for the big

00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:15.299
Caption: moment two months later when the poop

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:18.178
Caption: hits the fan and they&#39;re gonna say

00:33:15.298 --> 00:33:21.119
Caption: I told you so

00:33:18.178 --> 00:33:23.459
Caption: I told you two months ago

00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:25.558
Caption: right because they respond to the same

00:33:23.459 --> 00:33:27.359
Caption: exact stimuli in different ways and we

00:33:25.558 --> 00:33:29.099
Caption: need to understand this and this is why

00:33:27.359 --> 00:33:31.739
Caption: we have to have all types of

00:33:29.099 --> 00:33:33.839
Caption: communication and and facilitation

00:33:31.739 --> 00:33:36.239
Caption: during during our meeting so

00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:38.339
Caption: let&#39;s talk about encoding memories ways

00:33:36.239 --> 00:33:40.739
Caption: that we encode

00:33:38.339 --> 00:33:42.778
Caption: our memories

00:33:40.739 --> 00:33:45.178
Caption: our Focus right you could train your

00:33:42.779 --> 00:33:48.179
Caption: brain to recognize patterns for example

00:33:45.178 --> 00:33:50.278
Caption: you might want to think about trying to

00:33:48.178 --> 00:33:52.500
Caption: recognize somebody in a happy cheerful

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:54.360
Caption: moment and then the next day two happy

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.279
Caption: cheerful moments and then the next day

00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:58.380
Caption: three happy cheerful moments and then

00:33:56.279 --> 00:33:59.640
Caption: the next day four happy cheerful moments

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.619
Caption: because you know what we are really good

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.779
Caption: at finding the not so good moments we

00:34:01.619 --> 00:34:06.658
Caption: don&#39;t need that that&#39;s already implicit

00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:08.520
Caption: in our brain looking and scanning for

00:34:06.659 --> 00:34:12.300
Caption: threats so think about what your focus

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:13.979
Caption: is remember the popcorn eating while

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.599
Caption: watching the movie and eating popcorn

00:34:13.979 --> 00:34:18.959
Caption: with your friend and then you&#39;re like oh

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:22.560
Caption: sorry Joy but what&#39;s your focus

00:34:18.959 --> 00:34:26.239
Caption: next you can also train your brain with

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:29.399
Caption: a Slow and Low

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:31.699
Caption: let&#39;s try it right now ready Slow and

00:34:29.398 --> 00:34:31.699
Caption: Low

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:42.060
Caption: so these small intentional changes

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:44.459
Caption: that&#39;s how big changes are made and when

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:46.040
Caption: we have a relaxed nervous system we are

00:34:44.459 --> 00:34:49.020
Caption: going to be able to take in information

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:54.800
Caption: a whole lot better we can create our own

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:54.800
Caption: opportunities we can create our own luck

00:34:55.439 --> 00:35:00.959
Caption: we can improve our encoding

00:34:58.858 --> 00:35:03.118
Caption: through a technique

00:35:00.959 --> 00:35:05.338
Caption: that&#39;s called the memory card technique

00:35:03.118 --> 00:35:08.519
Caption: I&#39;m from Las Vegas we love to play cards

00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:10.260
Caption: in Vegas so you take some cards you lay

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.239
Caption: them all out and you can try to remember

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.880
Caption: them you can do things like try to

00:35:12.239 --> 00:35:16.800
Caption: remember the order of the 52 deck of

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:18.899
Caption: cards you can do things like try to

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.359
Caption: remember all of the cards that have a

00:35:18.899 --> 00:35:23.939
Caption: white background you can remember all of

00:35:21.358 --> 00:35:25.979
Caption: the black cards all of the red cards and

00:35:23.939 --> 00:35:27.060
Caption: after you do this over and over and over

00:35:25.979 --> 00:35:29.760
Caption: again what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:32.280
Caption: training your brain to encode data

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:35.219
Caption: better and faster

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:37.679
Caption: you can also do this through action this

00:35:35.219 --> 00:35:40.078
Caption: boosts our episodic memory encoding

00:35:37.679 --> 00:35:42.739
Caption: because it releases noradrenaline and so

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:45.660
Caption: if you&#39;ve got a wobbly kid like me right

00:35:42.739 --> 00:35:47.520
Caption: when they&#39;re studying give them a wobble

00:35:45.659 --> 00:35:50.760
Caption: cushion because they&#39;re going to wiggle

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.919
Caption: at school and so wiggle this is how we

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:55.260
Caption: get a lot of like um Active Learning

00:35:52.919 --> 00:35:57.419
Caption: right and and different types of seats

00:35:55.260 --> 00:36:00.239
Caption: in classrooms that the teachers these

00:35:57.419 --> 00:36:03.000
Caption: days uh are always advocating for right

00:36:00.239 --> 00:36:04.800
Caption: a more experiential Active Learning

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.899
Caption: environment is going to be a lot more

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.300
Caption: helpful for many Learners here&#39;s a new

00:36:06.899 --> 00:36:11.520
Caption: one this is in you can improve your

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:13.260
Caption: coding by the shoot the thumb technique

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.140
Caption: who has heard of this one shoot the

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.579
Caption: thumb technique is awesome and I&#39;m going

00:36:16.139 --> 00:36:20.219
Caption: to really embarrass myself okay here we

00:36:17.579 --> 00:36:23.640
Caption: go uh shoot the thumb technique you

00:36:20.219 --> 00:36:25.439
Caption: gotta shoot your thumb here we go all

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:26.959
Caption: right I got it okay I&#39;m gonna shoot my

00:36:25.439 --> 00:36:31.260
Caption: thumb all right so you shoot your thumb

00:36:26.959 --> 00:36:33.300
Caption: while you are holding on to a memory and

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:35.339
Caption: the cool part about this is is you get

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:38.880
Caption: bilateral stimulation of both

00:36:35.339 --> 00:36:41.660
Caption: hemispheres of your brain and as this

00:36:38.879 --> 00:36:44.879
Caption: information goes across your brain

00:36:41.659 --> 00:36:48.118
Caption: bilateral across your hemispheres you

00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:50.578
Caption: are oh look I&#39;m talking in it okay

00:36:48.118 --> 00:36:53.338
Caption: um you can

00:36:50.579 --> 00:36:55.739
Caption: have other data transfer across those

00:36:53.339 --> 00:36:58.739
Caption: neural Pathways it&#39;s not just that one

00:36:55.739 --> 00:37:00.959
Caption: memory that&#39;s held and so it&#39;s a really

00:36:58.739 --> 00:37:06.439
Caption: effective teaching strategy

00:37:00.959 --> 00:37:06.439
Caption: um for for helping to improve encoding

00:37:06.659 --> 00:37:11.039
Caption: um

00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:15.060
Caption: let&#39;s see shoot the thumb transmitting

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:17.099
Caption: data yes oh spacing effect the spacing

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:19.680
Caption: effect is one that I use for my for my

00:37:17.099 --> 00:37:21.960
Caption: pubconf talks any of my ignite talks

00:37:19.679 --> 00:37:23.819
Caption: those five minute super fast talk I did

00:37:21.959 --> 00:37:25.560
Caption: this with my tedx talk when I did that

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:28.440
Caption: one you can

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:31.560
Caption: um read your talk or your list

00:37:28.439 --> 00:37:32.939
Caption: and then say it out loud when you&#39;re

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.979
Caption: saying it out loud you&#39;re feeling your

00:37:32.939 --> 00:37:37.439
Caption: vocal cords you&#39;re hearing it yourself

00:37:34.979 --> 00:37:39.118
Caption: do it you&#39;re feeling you&#39;re writing it

00:37:37.439 --> 00:37:42.179
Caption: on the paper not just typing it out

00:37:39.118 --> 00:37:43.679
Caption: right and then read your list again or

00:37:42.179 --> 00:37:46.559
Caption: your talk again

00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:48.598
Caption: go to sleep you get take advantage of

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.979
Caption: that that memory consolidation technique

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:52.020
Caption: that we talked about earlier right

00:37:49.979 --> 00:37:53.820
Caption: remember and then when you wake up and

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:56.099
Caption: you repeat it the next day you&#39;re going

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.900
Caption: to significantly remember that

00:37:56.099 --> 00:38:00.119
Caption: information this is a very very

00:37:57.899 --> 00:38:03.059
Caption: effective technique

00:38:00.118 --> 00:38:04.679
Caption: the other thing you can do is relax you

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:07.680
Caption: can improve your memory according but

00:38:04.679 --> 00:38:10.139
Caption: encoding by relaxing again this allows a

00:38:07.679 --> 00:38:11.699
Caption: neurotransmitter vasopressin to be

00:38:10.139 --> 00:38:15.000
Caption: released and that makes us much more

00:38:11.699 --> 00:38:19.439
Caption: open to receiving information right so

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:23.579
Caption: you can take a nice big breath and you

00:38:19.439 --> 00:38:25.560
Caption: can relax so here is a summary of how we

00:38:23.579 --> 00:38:27.660
Caption: can improve in coding if you just take

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.640
Caption: one of these techniques and practice it

00:38:27.659 --> 00:38:31.739
Caption: every single day for three months I

00:38:29.639 --> 00:38:34.279
Caption: promise you you will improve your memory

00:38:31.739 --> 00:38:34.280
Caption: encoding

00:38:34.858 --> 00:38:41.279
Caption: let&#39;s talk about storing our memories

00:38:38.339 --> 00:38:43.619
Caption: we can use our senses sight sound smell

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.119
Caption: touch taste we have a sense of agency we

00:38:43.618 --> 00:38:49.679
Caption: have a sense of blushing a sense of

00:38:45.118 --> 00:38:52.618
Caption: hunger a sense of time the more that we

00:38:49.679 --> 00:38:53.939
Caption: can incorporate those the more we&#39;re

00:38:52.618 --> 00:38:56.118
Caption: going to remember it right so for

00:38:53.939 --> 00:38:58.800
Caption: example think about you you have songs

00:38:56.118 --> 00:39:01.379
Caption: that put you right back into that moment

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.760
Caption: right I think about uh uh the Rolling

00:39:01.379 --> 00:39:04.618
Caption: Stones I think about I Can&#39;t Get No

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:08.040
Caption: Satisfaction it takes me right back to

00:39:04.618 --> 00:39:09.959
Caption: that time like cruising in the car with

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:13.079
Caption: the windows down and the hair and I was

00:39:09.959 --> 00:39:15.419
Caption: like so young right like we all have

00:39:13.079 --> 00:39:18.900
Caption: certain songs

00:39:15.419 --> 00:39:21.299
Caption: that means something to us because of

00:39:18.899 --> 00:39:24.059
Caption: the way that we&#39;ve stored those memories

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:27.479
Caption: here&#39;s the thing about senses

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:29.520
Caption: they can be tricked right you add a

00:39:27.479 --> 00:39:33.300
Caption: shadow and suddenly it creates an

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:36.199
Caption: illusion so you can&#39;t depend just on one

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.199
Caption: of your senses

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:43.260
Caption: storytelling storytelling is another way

00:39:39.239 --> 00:39:45.598
Caption: that we can really remember things are

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:48.060
Caption: as humans we love stories we love

00:39:45.599 --> 00:39:49.920
Caption: stories I grew up in the midwest on the

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:52.320
Caption: shores of Lake Superior and my uncles

00:39:49.919 --> 00:39:54.118
Caption: they used to tell the grandest stories

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.760
Caption: of that fish they caught

00:39:54.118 --> 00:39:58.578
Caption: and every time they told the story The

00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:01.500
Caption: the fish would get a little bit bigger

00:39:58.579 --> 00:40:02.880
Caption: and a little bit bigger and a little bit

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.280
Caption: bigger and before you know I&#39;d be like

00:40:02.879 --> 00:40:07.439
Caption: hey remember that time when you caught

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.060
Caption: that big fish yeah and then everybody

00:40:07.439 --> 00:40:11.939
Caption: knows the story and we&#39;ve all heard it

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:16.260
Caption: so many times so storytelling is another

00:40:11.939 --> 00:40:19.260
Caption: way to help with your memory storage our

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:21.959
Caption: hippocampus is the way is the place in

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:24.419
Caption: our brain that that stores it and of

00:40:21.959 --> 00:40:26.219
Caption: course you know any of that bilateral

00:40:24.419 --> 00:40:28.679
Caption: thinking

00:40:26.219 --> 00:40:31.139
Caption: is going to help any of that bilateral

00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:33.659
Caption: stuff because what we know is that our

00:40:31.139 --> 00:40:37.618
Caption: brains store things in chunks we love

00:40:33.659 --> 00:40:39.479
Caption: chunks this is why we do things like uh

00:40:37.618 --> 00:40:40.260
Caption: we do phone numbers who&#39;s done this

00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:42.540
Caption: before

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:43.979
Caption: okay yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s trade numbers cool

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:45.179
Caption: all right yeah all right you get your

00:40:43.979 --> 00:40:46.739
Caption: paper out

00:40:45.179 --> 00:40:50.239
Caption: you get your pen you&#39;re ready to go okay

00:40:46.739 --> 00:40:53.239
Caption: go ahead I&#39;m I&#39;m ready all right it&#39;s

00:40:50.239 --> 00:40:56.699
Caption: 172 to

00:40:53.239 --> 00:40:58.320
Caption: 21 20 wait wait wait wait wait okay no

00:40:56.699 --> 00:41:00.540
Caption: your phone number yeah that is my phone

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:04.079
Caption: number okay it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:07.919
Caption: one seven hundred and two two two two

00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:10.320
Caption: two and then we&#39;re gonna do a 15 no just

00:41:07.919 --> 00:41:12.118
Caption: give it to me like a human and not a

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.699
Caption: psychopath okay would that be all right

00:41:12.118 --> 00:41:19.379
Caption: with you listen it&#39;s the Cadence it&#39;s

00:41:14.699 --> 00:41:22.979
Caption: the tone we like to chunk data it&#39;s one

00:41:19.379 --> 00:41:26.279
Caption: seven zero two two two two one five one

00:41:22.979 --> 00:41:29.338
Caption: five everybody knows you like the chunks

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:31.199
Caption: right we like chunks of data and so that

00:41:29.339 --> 00:41:34.619
Caption: is how you can improve your memory

00:41:31.199 --> 00:41:37.139
Caption: storage some basic influencing factors

00:41:34.618 --> 00:41:38.459
Caption: and so we could do things like uh

00:41:37.139 --> 00:41:41.039
Caption: meditate

00:41:38.459 --> 00:41:43.320
Caption: right I meditated this morning sat down

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.199
Caption: and did a little

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:47.760
Caption: um just before we got on because I like

00:41:46.199 --> 00:41:50.939
Caption: to be nice and relaxed it&#39;s going to

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:53.639
Caption: help us improve our learning our our

00:41:50.939 --> 00:41:57.419
Caption: capacity for empathy and our memory

00:41:53.639 --> 00:41:59.219
Caption: after just eight weeks of meditating

00:41:57.419 --> 00:42:02.280
Caption: even if you&#39;ve never even meditated

00:41:59.219 --> 00:42:04.560
Caption: before our brains will have more gray

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:06.839
Caption: matter and development in those areas

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.719
Caption: the other thing that we can do

00:42:06.839 --> 00:42:11.820
Caption: is get in touch with our feelings

00:42:09.719 --> 00:42:13.618
Caption: if we get in touch with our feelings and

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:15.660
Caption: our emotions we&#39;re going to remember

00:42:13.618 --> 00:42:19.039
Caption: more remember emotions are what drive

00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:22.078
Caption: that narrative and so that is going to

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:25.079
Caption: have a positive or it can have a

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:27.920
Caption: negative right effect on inhib

00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:30.599
Caption: inhibiting or prohibiting those

00:42:27.919 --> 00:42:33.838
Caption: neurotransmitters to Accurate activate

00:42:30.599 --> 00:42:37.320
Caption: parts of our brain so taken to the

00:42:33.839 --> 00:42:38.760
Caption: extreme if you&#39;re too emotional then you

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.380
Caption: might need to work a little bit on your

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.060
Caption: your psychological boundaries with

00:42:40.379 --> 00:42:44.219
Caption: people right so get in touch with your

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.780
Caption: feelings

00:42:44.219 --> 00:42:48.540
Caption: here&#39;s the other thing you can do is

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:51.179
Caption: Association for example putting on your

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:52.800
Caption: favorite hoodie or or or attaching that

00:42:51.179 --> 00:42:54.659
Caption: new information to something that&#39;s

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.219
Caption: already in there I do a workshop about

00:42:54.659 --> 00:42:59.219
Caption: this where we actually do practice

00:42:56.219 --> 00:43:01.618
Caption: things and we build a Memory Palace and

00:42:59.219 --> 00:43:05.159
Caption: I show you exactly how to associate

00:43:01.618 --> 00:43:08.578
Caption: certain memories with certain things and

00:43:05.159 --> 00:43:10.318
Caption: and that&#39;s already being retained

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:13.500
Caption: the other thing we can do is we can

00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:16.880
Caption: create chaos and you can break habits

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:19.219
Caption: where you&#39;re not really actually

00:43:16.879 --> 00:43:22.618
Caption: they&#39;re not actually serving you anymore

00:43:19.219 --> 00:43:24.719
Caption: instead you know sometimes we just have

00:43:22.618 --> 00:43:27.479
Caption: information in there and we just do it

00:43:24.719 --> 00:43:29.819
Caption: just because so there&#39;s the the story of

00:43:27.479 --> 00:43:31.439
Caption: the the Thanksgiving dinner or the

00:43:29.819 --> 00:43:33.479
Caption: Christmas dinner and then the mom is

00:43:31.439 --> 00:43:35.040
Caption: preparing it she&#39;s showing her daughter

00:43:33.479 --> 00:43:36.959
Caption: how to how to make the ham and how to

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.400
Caption: cook it okay cool so she takes in she

00:43:36.959 --> 00:43:40.739
Caption: puts all the seasonings on it and she

00:43:38.399 --> 00:43:42.539
Caption: she sets it down and she whacks it in

00:43:40.739 --> 00:43:44.579
Caption: half and she puts it in two pans and

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:46.979
Caption: then she puts it in the oven the

00:43:44.579 --> 00:43:49.260
Caption: daughter goes that&#39;s great mom but why

00:43:46.979 --> 00:43:50.459
Caption: do we whack it in half like what&#39;s she

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.139
Caption: said I don&#39;t know that&#39;s just the recipe

00:43:50.459 --> 00:43:54.000
Caption: that&#39;s how our family does it that&#39;s

00:43:52.139 --> 00:43:55.379
Caption: what grandma always said and she goes to

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.540
Caption: Grandma and she says hey

00:43:55.379 --> 00:44:00.659
Caption: how can we cut the ham in half what&#39;s

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:04.260
Caption: what and she said oh well we just never

00:44:00.659 --> 00:44:06.239
Caption: had a pan big enough so yes

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.219
Caption: so think about why you&#39;re doing things

00:44:06.239 --> 00:44:10.260
Caption: don&#39;t just put things onto autopilot

00:44:08.219 --> 00:44:12.179
Caption: over and over again we can improve our

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.800
Caption: storage through repetition remember if

00:44:12.179 --> 00:44:16.139
Caption: the stimulus is strong enough or

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.939
Caption: repetitive enough right you can

00:44:16.139 --> 00:44:19.919
Caption: strengthen those neural Pathways you get

00:44:17.939 --> 00:44:22.679
Caption: more protein synthesis the myelinated

00:44:19.919 --> 00:44:25.439
Caption: sheaths get bigger we get more bundles

00:44:22.679 --> 00:44:29.879
Caption: more neural Pathways in fact

00:44:25.439 --> 00:44:31.379
Caption: um through that memory subsystem and so

00:44:29.879 --> 00:44:33.059
Caption: um it&#39;s estimated in marketing and

00:44:31.379 --> 00:44:35.939
Caption: advertising in my world that somebody

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:40.319
Caption: needs to see something 21 times before

00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:42.358
Caption: before it sticks into our skulls and so

00:44:40.319 --> 00:44:44.520
Caption: you know we&#39;re exposed to that same

00:44:42.358 --> 00:44:46.379
Caption: messaging over and over and over again

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.780
Caption: you could see how this would be positive

00:44:46.379 --> 00:44:50.519
Caption: you could see also how this might be be

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:52.500
Caption: harmful as well

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.479
Caption: we can improve storage by better

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:58.379
Caption: documentation we see this in Tech right

00:44:54.479 --> 00:45:01.020
Caption: we can make documentation about why

00:44:58.379 --> 00:45:04.799
Caption: choices are made and also why not

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:07.380
Caption: choices were made because if we right

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:10.260
Caption: now say we&#39;re not this isn&#39;t going to

00:45:07.379 --> 00:45:11.699
Caption: work for us if we write y two years down

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:14.699
Caption: the road funding might become available

00:45:11.699 --> 00:45:16.919
Caption: right so maybe we can change that

00:45:14.699 --> 00:45:19.260
Caption: decision and it&#39;s documented right there

00:45:16.919 --> 00:45:21.598
Caption: instead of everybody going hmm now why

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:23.939
Caption: did we do this why didn&#39;t we do that I&#39;m

00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:26.040
Caption: not sure the project manager&#39;s gone

00:45:23.939 --> 00:45:29.219
Caption: sales team&#39;s long gone and nobody really

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:31.679
Caption: understands why those those choices and

00:45:29.219 --> 00:45:34.979
Caption: decisions were made we can also improve

00:45:31.679 --> 00:45:38.520
Caption: our storage by facilitating our meetings

00:45:34.979 --> 00:45:40.500
Caption: better remember somebody if if they

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.540
Caption: bring an idea to the table for example

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:44.280
Caption: and then two months later somebody

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.900
Caption: brings up that same idea and they go hey

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.179
Caption: let&#39;s do this

00:45:45.899 --> 00:45:50.279
Caption: yeah I I think that was a great idea

00:45:48.179 --> 00:45:52.078
Caption: that it was a great idea two months ago

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:56.459
Caption: when I brought it up

00:45:52.079 --> 00:45:58.920
Caption: but your focus wasn&#39;t on the who because

00:45:56.459 --> 00:46:01.858
Caption: instead you were focused on on the what

00:45:58.919 --> 00:46:04.679
Caption: so we can improve storage by you know

00:46:01.858 --> 00:46:06.179
Caption: having a better facilitated meetings

00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:08.659
Caption: and the last thing for improving storage

00:46:06.179 --> 00:46:11.280
Caption: I must mention is the Von restorf effect

00:46:08.659 --> 00:46:14.338
Caption: this is

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:16.319
Caption: the things that are unique are going to

00:46:14.339 --> 00:46:19.140
Caption: stand out and be remembered the most so

00:46:16.319 --> 00:46:21.359
Caption: I worked in a hotel during my uh college

00:46:19.139 --> 00:46:23.699
Caption: Years in the summer and there was a

00:46:21.358 --> 00:46:25.559
Caption: police officer there with his dog

00:46:23.699 --> 00:46:28.439
Caption: partner and they were they were training

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:29.939
Caption: and he was staying in the hotel and he

00:46:28.439 --> 00:46:31.739
Caption: and another officer were sitting there

00:46:29.939 --> 00:46:33.179
Caption: in the lobby one night and we were all

00:46:31.739 --> 00:46:34.618
Caption: talking and they were making fun of me

00:46:33.179 --> 00:46:37.318
Caption: because they&#39;re like oh yeah your white

00:46:34.618 --> 00:46:40.139
Caption: car you you better stop speeding because

00:46:37.319 --> 00:46:41.760
Caption: I I see white cars better right and the

00:46:40.139 --> 00:46:43.858
Caption: other police officer who&#39;s like no I

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:47.699
Caption: actually see red cars better because

00:46:43.858 --> 00:46:49.858
Caption: they stand out to me more and so he gave

00:46:47.699 --> 00:46:52.858
Caption: more tickets to to cars that were red

00:46:49.858 --> 00:46:54.779
Caption: cars as opposed to any other color of

00:46:52.858 --> 00:46:57.299
Caption: cars and and that&#39;s the Rand van

00:46:54.780 --> 00:47:00.119
Caption: restorff effect so we can take advantage

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:01.920
Caption: of things that maybe are a little bit

00:47:00.118 --> 00:47:04.199
Caption: more unique and they&#39;re you&#39;re going to

00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:08.659
Caption: uniquely stand out

00:47:04.199 --> 00:47:08.659
Caption: here is a summary of that

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:14.880
Caption: and so the last one

00:47:12.239 --> 00:47:16.618
Caption: I want to talk about how we retrieve our

00:47:14.879 --> 00:47:19.078
Caption: memories and so

00:47:16.618 --> 00:47:21.838
Caption: um something that influences uh that you

00:47:19.079 --> 00:47:23.880
Caption: know is tolving he&#39;s the one who

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:26.040
Caption: he proposed that that forgetting

00:47:23.879 --> 00:47:30.179
Caption: oftentimes is just a matter of memory

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:33.000
Caption: retrieval and so I think this was 1983

00:47:30.179 --> 00:47:35.639
Caption: yeah so this is when like

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.979
Caption: um you have that actor&#39;s name on the tip

00:47:35.639 --> 00:47:40.199
Caption: of your tongue and it&#39;s right there and

00:47:37.979 --> 00:47:42.239
Caption: you know he&#39;s that guy with the head the

00:47:40.199 --> 00:47:45.118
Caption: two worms he was in that show with the

00:47:42.239 --> 00:47:47.339
Caption: with the person right that&#39;s that&#39;s what

00:47:45.118 --> 00:47:49.799
Caption: the he&#39;s referring to when we start

00:47:47.339 --> 00:47:52.260
Caption: talking about memory retrieval and so

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:54.560
Caption: another example I do this I walk into my

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:58.260
Caption: kitchen and I go

00:47:54.560 --> 00:48:00.540
Caption: hmm now what the hell I come in here for

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:04.260
Caption: like what am I right and so what do we

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:07.079
Caption: do we backtrack we associate what we

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:09.000
Caption: were thinking and and how so we can

00:48:07.079 --> 00:48:11.460
Caption: retrieve those memories give it a cue

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.159
Caption: give it a prompt and then we can move

00:48:11.459 --> 00:48:16.618
Caption: forward so one way that we can improve

00:48:14.159 --> 00:48:17.939
Caption: our memory retrieval is we can use the

00:48:16.618 --> 00:48:20.399
Caption: same method

00:48:17.939 --> 00:48:23.520
Caption: so different cues help us manage our

00:48:20.399 --> 00:48:25.799
Caption: mindset and so uh we can improve our

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:28.739
Caption: memory retrieval by matching and

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:30.540
Caption: encoding uh the the matching the

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:33.358
Caption: encoding and the retrieval cues right

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:35.040
Caption: and if you use that same method every

00:48:33.358 --> 00:48:37.559
Caption: single time like sometimes people will

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:38.959
Caption: say all right I use the same method for

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.459
Caption: creating a password

00:48:38.959 --> 00:48:43.979
Caption: then it helps you remember the password

00:48:41.459 --> 00:48:45.959
Caption: without even having to remember 4 000

00:48:43.979 --> 00:48:48.780
Caption: passwords all the time and it also helps

00:48:45.959 --> 00:48:52.260
Caption: you as you change those passwords right

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:55.260
Caption: you can also do intentional recall your

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:57.179
Caption: mood and other biases you know there

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:59.699
Caption: whatever is in that moment they&#39;re going

00:48:57.179 --> 00:49:02.098
Caption: to influence the information that you

00:48:59.699 --> 00:49:03.598
Caption: recall so if you want to improve your

00:49:02.099 --> 00:49:06.060
Caption: memory retrieval

00:49:03.599 --> 00:49:08.760
Caption: consider that mindset that you&#39;re that

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:12.239
Caption: you&#39;re in and then you know move forward

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:15.359
Caption: with intentional recall intentional

00:49:12.239 --> 00:49:18.839
Caption: recall is then how we teach that

00:49:15.358 --> 00:49:21.239
Caption: information to people right if we

00:49:18.839 --> 00:49:23.520
Caption: feed it back to somebody this is what I

00:49:21.239 --> 00:49:27.540
Caption: learned then we are going to be much

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:30.599
Caption: more able to retrieve memories in the

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:33.959
Caption: future we&#39;re training our brain to think

00:49:30.599 --> 00:49:35.640
Caption: that way so consider maybe how the

00:49:33.959 --> 00:49:37.078
Caption: information could be applied to your

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:39.899
Caption: work that you&#39;ve learned in the

00:49:37.079 --> 00:49:41.640
Caption: conference this uh this afternoon right

00:49:39.899 --> 00:49:46.739
Caption: think about

00:49:41.639 --> 00:49:48.659
Caption: um how maybe you are going to long-term

00:49:46.739 --> 00:49:50.699
Caption: store something through Association

00:49:48.659 --> 00:49:54.299
Caption: that&#39;s also going to help imprint it

00:49:50.699 --> 00:49:56.399
Caption: into those neural pathways

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:58.199
Caption: the other thing you can do is stay

00:49:56.399 --> 00:50:01.379
Caption: healthy surprisingly or not

00:49:58.199 --> 00:50:05.399
Caption: unsurprisingly right sleep

00:50:01.379 --> 00:50:07.979
Caption: eating safety discomfort stress these

00:50:05.399 --> 00:50:10.260
Caption: things really affect your memory

00:50:07.979 --> 00:50:13.858
Caption: retrieval and then the last one is to

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:16.079
Caption: observe mindlessness right memories they

00:50:13.858 --> 00:50:18.118
Caption: can be malleable and so it&#39;s really

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:19.859
Caption: important to to bring your observation

00:50:18.118 --> 00:50:21.719
Caption: skills to the table maybe you want to

00:50:19.858 --> 00:50:24.358
Caption: take a different route to work or a

00:50:21.719 --> 00:50:25.919
Caption: different route home and just observe

00:50:24.358 --> 00:50:29.039
Caption: the things around you instead of

00:50:25.919 --> 00:50:31.919
Caption: normally maybe you drive and you arrive

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:33.839
Caption: at your destination and you go hmm I

00:50:31.919 --> 00:50:35.879
Caption: didn&#39;t really I guess I was kind of on

00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:38.579
Caption: autopilot right you kind of dissociate

00:50:35.879 --> 00:50:40.919
Caption: from the experience and so maybe it&#39;s

00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:43.560
Caption: time to sharpen the edges of your foggy

00:50:40.919 --> 00:50:45.899
Caption: mind in some of those places so take a

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:48.359
Caption: look here this is the ways that we can

00:50:45.899 --> 00:50:50.000
Caption: improve our memory retrieval

00:50:48.358 --> 00:50:52.379
Caption: the methodology

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.379
Caption: managing your mindset intentional

00:50:52.379 --> 00:50:57.419
Caption: recalls staying healthy and observing

00:50:55.379 --> 00:50:58.979
Caption: mindlessness so

00:50:57.419 --> 00:51:01.818
Caption: those are the mem the ways you can

00:50:58.979 --> 00:51:01.819
Caption: improve retrieval

00:51:02.099 --> 00:51:04.500
Caption: as you go through the rest of the

00:51:03.179 --> 00:51:05.520
Caption: conference

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.439
Caption: I want you to think about these

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:10.319
Caption: questions okay I want you to think about

00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:12.838
Caption: what you are remembering from the talks

00:51:10.319 --> 00:51:14.940
Caption: that you&#39;re seeing is there a pattern of

00:51:12.839 --> 00:51:16.859

00:52:21.719 --> 00:52:25.679
Caption: things

00:52:23.339 --> 00:52:27.680

Caption: all forget and as we&#39;ve learned today

00:52:27.679 --> 00:52:35.939

Caption: not be able to retrieve the the data

00:52:38.159 --> 00:52:42.780
Caption: that we already know and you don&#39;t have

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:44.699

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:47.579
Caption: ability to think think creatively

00:52:44.699 --> 00:52:49.739
Caption: through a solution that&#39;s where our

00:52:47.579 --> 00:52:52.079

00:52:49.739 --> 00:52:54.419

00:53:00.118 --> 00:53:05.519

Caption: our kids teaching them to just blindly

00:53:13.618 --> 00:53:18.679
Caption: follow things and memorize things

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:21.839

00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:25.140

Caption: inner child inside of all of us how well

00:53:37.739 --> 00:53:44.040

00:53:40.979 --> 00:53:46.618
Caption: defines our intellect it&#39;s how we apply

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:49.140

00:54:17.699 --> 00:54:23.399
Caption: remember what our focus is on and what

00:54:21.059 --> 00:54:25.979
Caption: we are taking away from all of these

00:54:23.399 --> 00:54:28.500
Caption: talks because every single person is

00:54:25.979 --> 00:54:31.020

00:54:34.979 --> 00:54:38.899
Caption: information together so thank you very
