00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:06.899
Caption: screen

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.300
Caption: I&#39;ll introduce you to Damien he runs the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.399
Caption: developer advocacy at GitHub and loves

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.319
Caption: all things devops formerly a cloud

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:16.260
Caption: Advocate at Microsoft for four years and

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:19.079
Caption: prior to that a devot octopus deploy and

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.459
Caption: and Microsoft MVP Damien has 20 plus

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.319
Caption: year background in software development

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:24.959
Caption: and Consulting in a broad range of

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:27.858
Caption: Industries he regularly speaks at

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:30.299
Caption: conferences just like this

00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:31.979
Caption: user groups and other events around the

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:35.279
Caption: world sorry that was mean

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:38.479
Caption: this is not this is not his fault just

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:38.479
Caption: just like this actually

00:00:55.439 --> 00:01:01.578
Caption: so let&#39;s give Damien a big long welcome

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:01.578
Caption: as he sets himself up

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:07.739
Caption: this is going well

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:09.539
Caption: um

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:11.158
Caption: I&#39;m going to skip all my slides because

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.419
Caption: that&#39;s a boring bit anyway

00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:13.559
Caption: um and I&#39;m just going to go straight to

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:16.379
Caption: demo so

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:19.379
Caption: my name is Damian Brady I work at GitHub

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:21.599
Caption: I lead our developer advocacy team

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:23.758
Caption: um I came from Microsoft I&#39;ve talked

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:25.258
Caption: about devops for years

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.500
Caption: um this time I&#39;m going to be talking

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.900
Caption: about devops in terms of doing it all on

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.759
Caption: codes on sorry on GitHub

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.500
Caption: right so we&#39;re going to be going from

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.000
Caption: planning and tracking all the way

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.500
Caption: through to the inner loop like actually

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.500
Caption: writing code in the cloud on code spaces

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.298
Caption: and then actions to deploy like with a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.540
Caption: CI CD pipeline all the way through to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.700
Caption: the end all right now

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.619
Caption: I started about 15 minutes late so let&#39;s

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:54.298
Caption: see how quickly we can do this if I skip

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.340
Caption: over stuff and you&#39;re like I really want

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.619
Caption: to know more about that we have all of

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:59.938
Caption: this demo stuff at the GitHub Booth as

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.200
Caption: well so come and have a look the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.100
Caption: difference in the GitHub Booth though is

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:03.919
Caption: that everything&#39;s running off a

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.419
Caption: Raspberry Pi so I&#39;m doing

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:08.098
Caption: multi-container development debugging

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:10.199
Caption: and stuff but my Dev machines this

00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:12.179
Caption: Raspberry Pi hanging from a carabiner

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.279
Caption: next to the TV

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.958
Caption: we&#39;ll see some of that in a sec not the

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:18.958
Caption: Raspberry Pi but the code spaces right

00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:21.899
Caption: so devops you&#39;ve all seen that kind of

00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:23.759
Caption: uh sideways eight like the infinity

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:27.119
Caption: symbol that we talk about with devops

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:29.699
Caption: where we do plan you know build deploy

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:31.080
Caption: and then learn from that the idea with

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:33.779
Caption: devops being that you can get through

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.279
Caption: that whole like infinity symbol as

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:37.020
Caption: quickly as possible so get stuff out to

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.699
Caption: production as quickly as possible so you

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.458
Caption: can learn from it and work out what

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:43.259
Caption: needs to be done next right

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:45.059
Caption: um what I&#39;m going to focus on today is

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.799
Caption: everything from the plan bit all the way

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.539
Caption: through to production right we&#39;re not

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.160
Caption: really going to talk so much about the

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:53.098
Caption: learning from it

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.958
Caption: um GitHub doesn&#39;t have a product for for

00:02:53.098 --> 00:02:56.639
Caption: you know looking at metrics of things

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.860
Caption: that are going on in production we do

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.899
Caption: have awesome kind of tooling around

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.399
Caption: discussions with your communities and of

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:05.339
Caption: course there&#39;s GitHub issues that can be

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:06.958
Caption: open so the community can contribute as

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:09.179
Caption: well or your customers can contribute as

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.738
Caption: well to what you&#39;re doing but we&#39;re not

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:12.899
Caption: going to really cover that that part so

00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:14.580
Caption: much Beyond just issues

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:16.860
Caption: all right I&#39;m already talking too much

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.759
Caption: let&#39;s go and have a look you can see a

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.680
Caption: little bit about some of the security

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:22.139
Caption: stuff that&#39;s built in here as well

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:24.238
Caption: um dependabot has told me that my code

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.339
Caption: has security vulnerabilities

00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:27.658
Caption: which is deliberate I promise

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:30.238
Caption: um I&#39;m just going to ignore them at the

00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:31.979
Caption: moment which is also deliberate oh this

00:03:30.238 --> 00:03:35.419
Caption: is going to be fun your scroll things

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.419
Caption: reverse of what I usually use

00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:43.259
Caption: yeah I&#39;m playing in hard mode all right

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:46.199
Caption: who who&#39;s familiar with GitHub issues

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:48.238
Caption: yep okay cool if you&#39;re not GitHub

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:51.958
Caption: issues is kind of the way that we track

00:03:48.238 --> 00:03:54.059
Caption: a piece of work so issues the word issue

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:56.098
Caption: as we use it is a thing that we need to

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.179
Caption: care about ultimately it&#39;s fine I&#39;ll

00:03:56.098 --> 00:03:58.259
Caption: work it out

00:03:57.179 --> 00:04:00.298
Caption: um

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.679
Caption: okay oh yeah

00:04:00.298 --> 00:04:04.798
Caption: um it&#39;s it&#39;s a thing we need to care

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:06.059
Caption: about right it&#39;s not uh a bug it&#39;s not a

00:04:04.798 --> 00:04:07.619
Caption: synonym for a bug although you can

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:10.319
Caption: absolutely track your bugs using GitHub

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:13.139
Caption: issues we use issues internally for

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.839
Caption: everything at GitHub so we in our devrel

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:18.119
Caption: organization we have a repository that

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:19.619
Caption: has very little code in it but it we use

00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:21.958
Caption: issues to track all of the work that

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:23.279
Caption: everybody is doing the whole way through

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.600
Caption: and you&#39;ll see some of the planning and

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.759
Caption: tracking tools and why it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.080
Caption: valuable to do that regardless of

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.959
Caption: whether they&#39;re actual pieces of code

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:33.478
Caption: that you need to change or not so the

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:35.759
Caption: GitHub issues um UI when you go to the

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.199
Caption: issues tab in GitHub you&#39;ll just get

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.639
Caption: this list of all of the issues that are

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.959
Caption: in there you know categorized by open

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.580
Caption: and closed you can do some great

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:44.279
Caption: searching and filtering and stuff like

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:46.799
Caption: that apply labels all that kind of thing

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:48.239
Caption: um and so the the experience with

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:50.638
Caption: actually creating issues and using

00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:52.559
Caption: issues is pretty good too so if we

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.520
Caption: create an issue

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.679
Caption: um

00:04:53.519 --> 00:05:00.359
Caption: you know you can give it a title uh

00:04:55.679 --> 00:05:02.220
Caption: what&#39;s a title fix that laptop output

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:04.619
Caption: which is a good one

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.179
Caption: um and then you can you know put a whole

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:06.779
Caption: lot of detail about

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:09.119
Caption: um

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:11.579
Caption: stuff what&#39;s the screenshotting Windows

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:13.320
Caption: Windows shift s

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:15.299
Caption: yeah

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.139
Caption: yeah I&#39;m a pro

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:19.019
Caption: um

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.800
Caption: you can even do things like paste images

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:24.539
Caption: uh wrong Keys uh you can even like copy

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:27.299
Caption: and paste images so I just took a

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.059
Caption: screenshot and then

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:33.119
Caption: the preview can see that screenshot that

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:36.539
Caption: I just took so you can copy paste images

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:38.039
Caption: you can do rich markdown formatting all

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.559
Caption: that kind of stuff there&#39;s some really

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.539
Caption: good features around task lists too so

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:44.779
Caption: you can set a list of you know things

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.880
Caption: you need to do

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:50.279
Caption: second thing and then

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.559
Caption: when you save or submit that issue just

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:54.000
Caption: get rid of that last one

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.459
Caption: you can see that there&#39;s a task list

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.799
Caption: attached to this issue as well

00:05:56.459 --> 00:06:01.679
Caption: and we can see that there are two tasks

00:05:58.799 --> 00:06:03.720
Caption: for that issue that need to be done and

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:06.059
Caption: maybe I want to say I&#39;ve done the first

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.059
Caption: thing but maybe the second thing needs a

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:13.079
Caption: little bit more work and so I can just

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:15.959
Caption: need to refresh ah wrong buttons F5

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:18.359
Caption: no that&#39;s all right see this is why I

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:21.419
Caption: have a desktop PC at home and a Macbook

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:22.978
Caption: so I know both of them anyway so the

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.300
Caption: second one maybe I want to actually

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.800
Caption: convert that to an issue because it

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:28.019
Caption: needs some more expansion notes and more

00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:30.000
Caption: details when I do that it&#39;ll create an

00:06:28.019 --> 00:06:32.279
Caption: issue from that second thing and if I

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.199
Caption: drill into that issue we can see that

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:36.059
Caption: that is tracked in one of the previous

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.580
Caption: issues so we have this kind of hierarchy

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:40.619
Caption: the hierarchy stuff in GitHub issues is

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:43.500
Caption: still kind of being built out it&#39;ll be a

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:45.600
Caption: lot richer in the future right now we we

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.819
Caption: kind of do have this hierarchy between

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.259
Caption: and you can go down as deep as you want

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.639
Caption: if I did a task list in this and

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:52.799
Caption: converted them to issues you can see

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.660
Caption: that it&#39;s tracked in those ones as well

00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:56.638
Caption: that stuff will start surfacing a bit

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.800
Caption: more soon

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:00.419
Caption: so we&#39;ve got our issues we can do real

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:02.698
Caption: really rich markdown we can even do like

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:05.520
Caption: mathematical formulas and we use um

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.020
Caption: tooling to do flow charts and stuff like

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:09.179
Caption: that you can put in there in markdown

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:11.940
Caption: it&#39;s this GitHub flavored markdown that

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:14.039
Caption: we have which is a little bit richer

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.139
Caption: but this probably isn&#39;t the best way to

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:17.819
Caption: like manage all of your issues you might

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.740
Caption: have thousands of issues

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.959
Caption: you can&#39;t really run a Sprint just by

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:23.699
Caption: what you can run a Sprint by just

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:25.440
Caption: applying a label to that issue for

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.940
Caption: Sprint one and then just filtering to

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.660
Caption: those labels it&#39;s not the best way to

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.580
Caption: work

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.819
Caption: so we&#39;ve got issues sorry we&#39;ve got

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:34.198
Caption: GitHub projects now GitHub projects is

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:36.720
Caption: new

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:38.819
Caption: um if you have used GitHub projects in

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.559
Caption: the past you might have used the the

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:42.720
Caption: Legacy projects which we&#39;ve now

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:44.819
Caption: deprecated there is a really nice

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.220
Caption: migration path from the old projects to

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:48.179
Caption: the new projects

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.500
Caption: Mitch just did a video on that really

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:52.859
Caption: recently I don&#39;t know how where we&#39;ve

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.160
Caption: probably published it on YouTube

00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:57.119
Caption: on Instagram today there we go

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.679
Caption: and so I&#39;m going to create a new project

00:07:57.119 --> 00:08:00.419
Caption: uh

00:07:58.679 --> 00:08:02.880
Caption: I&#39;m going to go to the organization to

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:04.020
Caption: create a project

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.000
Caption: uh

00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:09.359
Caption: new project

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.279
Caption: I would call it DDD Perth now I can

00:08:09.359 --> 00:08:13.019
Caption: choose one of the templates for these

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:15.059
Caption: projects or I can just go from scratch

00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:17.160
Caption: I&#39;m just going to go from scratch just

00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:19.739
Caption: to show you how powerful this is

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.839
Caption: and I&#39;m going to add the issues from my

00:08:19.739 --> 00:08:23.279
Caption: repository so to do that

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:24.899
Caption: by the way we&#39;re looking at the table

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:27.899
Caption: View at the moment

00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:32.158
Caption: to add an issue I choose my repository

00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:35.039
Caption: uh it&#39;s haikus for code spaces and then

00:08:32.158 --> 00:08:37.140
Caption: I&#39;m just gonna choose

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:39.539
Caption: yeah that one

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:42.718
Caption: so now I have that issue in there

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:43.559
Caption: this thing&#39;s hurting me

00:08:42.718 --> 00:08:45.659
Caption: um

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:48.500
Caption: and I can add

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:48.500
Caption: left click

00:08:50.278 --> 00:08:54.179
Caption: we&#39;ve also made this quite like keyboard

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.039
Caption: friendly so I&#39;m just kind of hitting

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:58.320
Caption: enter and it&#39;s taking the top one each

00:08:56.039 --> 00:09:01.739
Caption: time just to fill them out

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.479
Caption: and we&#39;ve now got this list of you know

00:09:01.739 --> 00:09:05.039
Caption: issues that we&#39;re working with we&#39;ve got

00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:06.778
Caption: our columns we&#39;ve got assignees we&#39;ve

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:09.059
Caption: got the status of those issues as well

00:09:06.778 --> 00:09:11.659
Caption: now status is something that belongs to

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:11.659
Caption: the board

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:16.440
Caption: um so by default you get to do in

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.179
Caption: progress and done but I can change those

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.398
Caption: statuses I can have whatever statuses I

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:21.239
Caption: want but I can also have custom fields

00:09:20.398 --> 00:09:24.000
Caption: in here

00:09:21.239 --> 00:09:25.679
Caption: so I can say I want to see the labels

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.619
Caption: that&#39;s great that&#39;s pretty useful but I

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:32.419
Caption: want a new field for an estimate

00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:32.419
Caption: and then that field type is a number

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.600
Caption: and now we have this estimate column as

00:09:34.739 --> 00:09:38.219
Caption: well so I&#39;m just going to go and put

00:09:36.599 --> 00:09:40.139
Caption: some

00:09:38.219 --> 00:09:42.719
Caption: random numbers in that estimate column

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.278
Caption: if I can work things

00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:45.898
Caption: I&#39;m putting random numbers in because

00:09:44.278 --> 00:09:48.659
Caption: this is like a real life demo where

00:09:45.898 --> 00:09:49.739
Caption: estimates are totally random anyway

00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:51.239
Caption: um

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:53.760
Caption: and then I can obviously do things like

00:09:51.239 --> 00:09:56.278
Caption: filter and say I only want to see the

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:00.059
Caption: estimates that are greater than five oh

00:09:56.278 --> 00:10:02.760
Caption: keyboard shortcuts up the opposite so

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:06.179
Caption: Ctrl K on windows by the way no come not

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.559
Caption: Windows K and I can filter by

00:10:06.179 --> 00:10:08.458
Caption: you know

00:10:07.559 --> 00:10:10.919
Caption: um

00:10:08.458 --> 00:10:12.898
Caption: what do we go estimate and just say it

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:14.940
Caption: has to be greater than five and it&#39;ll

00:10:12.898 --> 00:10:18.299
Caption: filter based on those so we can do that

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:21.720
Caption: we can Group by the statuses grouped by

00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:25.099
Caption: the labels uh let&#39;s Group by actually we

00:10:21.719 --> 00:10:25.099
Caption: need another field here for

00:10:25.619 --> 00:10:31.940
Caption: um Sprint

00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:31.940
Caption: and this is actually a iteration type

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.559
Caption: and it starts today iterations go for

00:10:35.398 --> 00:10:39.539
Caption: two weeks so in the background it&#39;s

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:42.059
Caption: created some iterations for me based on

00:10:39.539 --> 00:10:46.338
Caption: every two weeks and I can assign these

00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:46.338
Caption: to these Sprints as we go as well so

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.720
Caption: yeah let&#39;s do that

00:10:52.859 --> 00:10:57.659
Caption: and then we&#39;ll

00:10:54.778 --> 00:10:59.940
Caption: grouped by these

00:10:57.659 --> 00:11:01.559
Caption: so now we&#39;ve got all of our Sprint one

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.260
Caption: Sprint two Sprint three and then the

00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:06.898
Caption: ones that haven&#39;t been

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:08.700
Caption: haven&#39;t been done yet

00:11:06.898 --> 00:11:11.039
Caption: so we got this like nice little table

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.079
Caption: view the other thing we might want to do

00:11:11.039 --> 00:11:15.838
Caption: though is have like a Sprint board right

00:11:13.078 --> 00:11:18.419
Caption: so let&#39;s create a new view

00:11:15.838 --> 00:11:20.039
Caption: and this view is going to be

00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:22.018
Caption: a board View

00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:24.299
Caption: and so now we have our

00:11:22.018 --> 00:11:25.979
Caption: board for all the ones with no status so

00:11:24.299 --> 00:11:28.979
Caption: by default it&#39;s kind of given me the

00:11:25.979 --> 00:11:31.199
Caption: status so to do doing done none of these

00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:32.880
Caption: have a status so I obviously want some

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.100
Caption: of them over here

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.458
Caption: but actually this is my Sprint board so

00:11:35.099 --> 00:11:41.159
Caption: I&#39;m gonna filter by

00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:44.119
Caption: filter by

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:44.119
Caption: Sprint

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:47.179
Caption: and then just say

00:11:48.119 --> 00:11:51.838
Caption: the current Sprint

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:53.099
Caption: so you can say you know this is the

00:11:51.838 --> 00:11:54.299
Caption: current Sprint or the previous Sprint or

00:11:53.099 --> 00:11:57.119
Caption: the next Sprint you can even say current

00:11:54.299 --> 00:11:58.500
Caption: plus two or previous minus one or

00:11:57.119 --> 00:12:00.838
Caption: something like that which is pretty

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.159
Caption: handy and then you can work with these

00:12:00.838 --> 00:12:04.018
Caption: these Sprint boards as well you can

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:07.259
Caption: change what&#39;s on the cards

00:12:04.018 --> 00:12:10.078
Caption: I mean this is a demo that I could spend

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.398
Caption: hours and hours on if I could work the

00:12:10.078 --> 00:12:13.919
Caption: mouse

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:15.958
Caption: um one thing to note as well is that

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:18.539
Caption: these projects are

00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:20.518
Caption: at the organization level

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:21.838
Caption: so we understand that you might have

00:12:20.518 --> 00:12:22.979
Caption: issues across a number of different

00:12:21.838 --> 00:12:25.078
Caption: repos

00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:27.419
Caption: for a project especially if you have a

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:28.679
Caption: microservices situation where you have a

00:12:27.419 --> 00:12:30.778
Caption: different repo for your different

00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:32.278
Caption: services but you want this roll-up view

00:12:30.778 --> 00:12:33.539
Caption: of all of the things that are going on

00:12:32.278 --> 00:12:35.700
Caption: at the moment

00:12:33.539 --> 00:12:37.739
Caption: so at the org level you have a project

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.299
Caption: and you pull in the issues that you care

00:12:37.739 --> 00:12:41.700
Caption: about for that project across the

00:12:39.299 --> 00:12:43.138
Caption: different repositories or maybe pull in

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.880
Caption: the pull requests because you care about

00:12:43.138 --> 00:12:46.799
Caption: them as well so issues and pull requests

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.638
Caption: can appear here

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:49.979
Caption: um

00:12:47.638 --> 00:12:51.898
Caption: you can also have the same issue in

00:12:49.979 --> 00:12:54.000
Caption: multiple projects and those projects can

00:12:51.898 --> 00:12:55.500
Caption: have different custom Fields so here

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.838
Caption: I&#39;ve got a bunch of work that&#39;s going on

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.440
Caption: maybe my managers want a different view

00:12:57.838 --> 00:13:03.599
Caption: of all of the epics in my organization

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.159
Caption: across multiple projects and they also

00:13:03.599 --> 00:13:07.380
Caption: have some Fields they want to track like

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:10.319
Caption: maybe they just want a current status of

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:13.320
Caption: red green and yellow or something like

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:16.320
Caption: that that extra field belongs to that

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.700
Caption: project and the issue can set you know

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.838
Caption: that value on the project so you can

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.700
Caption: have different views of the same

00:13:18.838 --> 00:13:22.440
Caption: information the great thing about this

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.958
Caption: though is you can absolutely customize

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.659
Caption: this for however you want you don&#39;t need

00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:29.578
Caption: to you know you&#39;re not stuck in the way

00:13:27.659 --> 00:13:32.518
Caption: that GitHub thinks you should run a

00:13:29.578 --> 00:13:34.018
Caption: project you can do it any way you want

00:13:32.518 --> 00:13:36.239
Caption: the one thing I didn&#39;t show you in this

00:13:34.018 --> 00:13:39.659
Caption: which I love is that you can also put in

00:13:36.239 --> 00:13:40.679
Caption: draft issues so I can add one here to

00:13:39.659 --> 00:13:43.319
Caption: say

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:45.239
Caption: um I don&#39;t know get a new laptop

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.880
Caption: there&#39;s a theme for these issues by the

00:13:45.239 --> 00:13:49.500
Caption: way and this is a draft issue because it

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.479
Caption: doesn&#39;t belong to a repository yet it

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:55.078
Caption: just belongs to this project

00:13:51.479 --> 00:13:58.138
Caption: we have teams in GitHub who use

00:13:55.078 --> 00:14:00.179
Caption: basically nothing but draft issues they

00:13:58.138 --> 00:14:01.679
Caption: do everything as draft issues and it&#39;s

00:14:00.179 --> 00:14:05.219
Caption: only when they actually need to do the

00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:07.018
Caption: work that they will convert to an issue

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:08.458
Caption: and then it will ask you what repository

00:14:07.018 --> 00:14:11.398
Caption: you want that issue in because it has to

00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:13.380
Caption: belong to a repository at that stage

00:14:11.398 --> 00:14:15.239
Caption: so look I could I could go on and on

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.578
Caption: about all of this sort of stuff

00:14:15.239 --> 00:14:19.440
Caption: um before I move on to kind of moving on

00:14:17.578 --> 00:14:22.799
Caption: from the planning any questions about

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.739
Caption: stuff that I haven&#39;t shown you on here

00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:28.320
Caption: anyone want to give me a laptop

00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:31.260
Caption: and staying down okay

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.880
Caption: so look this is also free for everybody

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.799
Caption: um we don&#39;t charge anything for GitHub

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.138
Caption: projects so your own repositories you

00:14:34.799 --> 00:14:38.700
Caption: can do it or your own organizations your

00:14:37.138 --> 00:14:40.979
Caption: own accounts you can have projects as

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.720
Caption: well anything you anything you like

00:14:40.979 --> 00:14:43.919
Caption: there&#39;s no extra money for this there&#39;s

00:14:42.719 --> 00:14:46.619
Caption: some other features that I didn&#39;t show

00:14:43.919 --> 00:14:51.000
Caption: you as well to do with like workflows

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:52.619
Caption: um so when a an issue sorry when an

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.299
Caption: issue gets dragged into the done column

00:14:52.619 --> 00:14:55.739
Caption: then market is closed in the repo and

00:14:54.299 --> 00:14:56.940
Caption: things like that I&#39;m sorry other way

00:14:55.739 --> 00:14:58.559
Caption: around

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.539
Caption: um a bunch of things like that there&#39;s

00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:03.179
Caption: more coming to workflows as well there&#39;s

00:15:00.539 --> 00:15:04.018
Caption: also insights that is I don&#39;t know if

00:15:03.179 --> 00:15:06.659
Caption: it&#39;s

00:15:04.018 --> 00:15:09.359
Caption: public preview yet I think it&#39;s in the

00:15:06.659 --> 00:15:12.179
Caption: public beta insights so you can do your

00:15:09.359 --> 00:15:14.518
Caption: burn down charts or burn up accumulative

00:15:12.179 --> 00:15:16.919
Caption: flow diagrams or the management manager

00:15:14.518 --> 00:15:18.778
Caption: stuff as well

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:19.979
Caption: somebody from GitHub in the back is

00:15:18.778 --> 00:15:22.458
Caption: looking at me like I don&#39;t know if

00:15:19.979 --> 00:15:22.458
Caption: that&#39;s public

00:15:23.338 --> 00:15:26.359
Caption: Johnson&#39;s dog

00:15:29.338 --> 00:15:32.940
Caption: yeah

00:15:30.078 --> 00:15:34.440
Caption: so at org level for the oh yeah okay

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.479
Caption: there we go so the burn up charts and

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.880
Caption: stuff are at the

00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:41.539
Caption: um Enterprise right or Global burn up

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.539
Caption: chance yeah

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.299
Caption: cool

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:46.859
Caption: awesome all right let&#39;s go back to this

00:15:45.299 --> 00:15:50.039
Caption: code and we&#39;re going to do some of this

00:15:46.859 --> 00:15:51.479
Caption: work all right so uh I don&#39;t know if

00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:53.578
Caption: anybody here had the same experience as

00:15:51.479 --> 00:15:55.679
Caption: me with my first Dev job is it took

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:57.179
Caption: literally about a month before I could

00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:59.458
Caption: actually write code on the code base

00:15:57.179 --> 00:16:01.440
Caption: because they had to find me a computer

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:02.760
Caption: and then I had to set that computer up

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.380
Caption: with the standard operating environment

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.820
Caption: and then the project I was on had these

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:08.039
Caption: other dependencies that I needed in

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.838
Caption: there as well so you know time to

00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:12.239
Caption: actually writing the first code or

00:16:09.838 --> 00:16:15.119
Caption: making the first commit was long right

00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:17.099
Caption: which is a problem especially if you are

00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:18.898
Caption: on multiple projects I don&#39;t know if

00:16:17.099 --> 00:16:21.239
Caption: anybody&#39;s skipped from one project to

00:16:18.898 --> 00:16:22.559
Caption: another and there&#39;s this period of how

00:16:21.239 --> 00:16:23.698
Caption: do I get all this stuff working they&#39;re

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:25.679
Caption: using different versions of the

00:16:23.698 --> 00:16:29.099
Caption: dependencies all that kind of stuff

00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:31.739
Caption: it&#39;s also bad for open source and for

00:16:29.099 --> 00:16:33.059
Caption: contributing to other projects inner

00:16:31.739 --> 00:16:35.880
Caption: source is a problem as well so I know

00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:37.320
Caption: when I worked at Microsoft everyone at

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.078
Caption: Microsoft every engineer at Microsoft

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.699
Caption: has access to almost every repository

00:16:40.078 --> 00:16:44.099
Caption: every code base

00:16:41.698 --> 00:16:45.419
Caption: and you&#39;re encouraged if you find

00:16:44.099 --> 00:16:46.919
Caption: something that you need in somebody

00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:48.898
Caption: else&#39;s code base to submit a pull

00:16:46.919 --> 00:16:50.458
Caption: request like to to actually go and

00:16:48.898 --> 00:16:52.799
Caption: change it look at their code see how it

00:16:50.458 --> 00:16:54.539
Caption: works which is great except I can&#39;t

00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:57.059
Caption: debug that because they&#39;ve got this huge

00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:59.219
Caption: list of dependencies I can&#39;t get that

00:16:57.059 --> 00:17:00.359
Caption: working it&#39;s not worth my time so I just

00:16:59.219 --> 00:17:03.958
Caption: don&#39;t do it

00:17:00.359 --> 00:17:06.000
Caption: enter code spaces so code spaces is a

00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:08.640
Caption: Dev environment in the cloud that&#39;s

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.318
Caption: targeted at a specific repository so you

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.318
Caption: basically have the definition of what&#39;s

00:17:10.318 --> 00:17:14.578
Caption: required to write code for a project

00:17:12.318 --> 00:17:16.739
Caption: defined alongside the code for that

00:17:14.578 --> 00:17:19.198
Caption: project

00:17:16.739 --> 00:17:20.698
Caption: um before before code space as well if

00:17:19.198 --> 00:17:21.900
Caption: you just want to make a small change you

00:17:20.698 --> 00:17:23.280
Caption: don&#39;t need to do any debugging or

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.698
Caption: anything like that just in case anybody

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.679
Caption: hasn&#39;t seen this before this is in every

00:17:26.698 --> 00:17:30.839
Caption: repository if you hit the dot button

00:17:28.678 --> 00:17:33.839
Caption: presuming it&#39;s the same on a different

00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:36.000
Caption: laptop the full stop button dot button

00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:38.459
Caption: period whatever you want to call it

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.418
Caption: on any GitHub repo even if it&#39;s not

00:17:38.459 --> 00:17:43.260
Caption: yours

00:17:39.418 --> 00:17:46.319
Caption: it&#39;ll open the web editor which is

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:48.839
Caption: basically Visual Studio code running in

00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:50.038
Caption: your browser so there&#39;s no compute on

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:52.140
Caption: the back end in this case it&#39;s just

00:17:50.038 --> 00:17:54.779
Caption: running inside your browser

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:57.839
Caption: and

00:17:54.780 --> 00:18:01.799
Caption: you can make changes to the code you can

00:17:57.839 --> 00:18:03.900
Caption: not debug but you can submit a code

00:18:01.798 --> 00:18:06.418
Caption: change you can submit a pull request you

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.440
Caption: can do all of that kind of stuff

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:10.319
Caption: um

00:18:07.439 --> 00:18:12.119
Caption: yeah so you can make small changes I

00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:13.739
Caption: actually use this constantly like if I

00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:16.199
Caption: need to make a small change to a readme

00:18:13.739 --> 00:18:17.699
Caption: or something like that I&#39;ll just hit dot

00:18:16.199 --> 00:18:20.699
Caption: open it up in here

00:18:17.699 --> 00:18:22.380
Caption: this is also really really good for code

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:24.479
Caption: reviews so if somebody submits a pull

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:26.880
Caption: request and you go to the pull request

00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:29.038
Caption: page and hit the dot you&#39;re brought to

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.359
Caption: visual studio code to the web editor or

00:18:29.038 --> 00:18:32.519
Caption: web-based editor

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:33.780
Caption: uh in the context of looking at that

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.700
Caption: pull request

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:38.640
Caption: so you can see the changes you can see

00:18:35.699 --> 00:18:40.439
Caption: what was committed uh the files that are

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.780
Caption: different and you can leave comments and

00:18:40.439 --> 00:18:44.099
Caption: say this looks good if you have

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.400
Caption: permissions you can even merge those

00:18:44.099 --> 00:18:50.099
Caption: pull requests in the context of a visual

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.660
Caption: studio code instance so you can see the

00:18:50.099 --> 00:18:53.760
Caption: library as you can see all the files you

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.320
Caption: can see everything like that

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.699
Caption: but like I said what you can&#39;t do here

00:18:55.319 --> 00:18:58.139
Caption: unfortunately

00:18:56.699 --> 00:19:01.139
Caption: is

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.140
Caption: debug

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.940
Caption: especially if you don&#39;t know the

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.140
Caption: shortcut keys so there&#39;s no terminal

00:19:05.939 --> 00:19:10.139
Caption: because there&#39;s no compute in the

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.700
Caption: background I can&#39;t do any run and debug

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.320
Caption: stuff because there&#39;s no compute in the

00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:15.359
Caption: background

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:18.239
Caption: um and obviously in the real world you

00:19:15.359 --> 00:19:21.660
Caption: need to do that stuff so code spaces is

00:19:18.239 --> 00:19:23.819
Caption: basically the same as this except it has

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.679
Caption: compute it&#39;s a cloud-based Dev

00:19:23.819 --> 00:19:27.058
Caption: environment

00:19:25.678 --> 00:19:28.739
Caption: um now because we&#39;re short on time

00:19:27.058 --> 00:19:31.619
Caption: normally I&#39;d create a new one to show

00:19:28.739 --> 00:19:33.479
Caption: you how how quickly this works but if

00:19:31.619 --> 00:19:35.239
Caption: you go to the code button here and then

00:19:33.479 --> 00:19:38.579
Caption: go to code spaces

00:19:35.239 --> 00:19:40.739
Caption: uh and I&#39;ve got one here which is not

00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:42.000
Caption: clean that&#39;s great

00:19:40.739 --> 00:19:43.739
Caption: you know what I&#39;m just going to create a

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.020
Caption: new code space

00:19:43.739 --> 00:19:46.979
Caption: so you can see how fast it is

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.020
Caption: um

00:19:46.979 --> 00:19:50.640
Caption: so what it is doing is it&#39;s spinning up

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:54.599
Caption: a container in the cloud that&#39;s running

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.919
Caption: on a machine that has whatever resources

00:19:54.599 --> 00:19:58.199
Caption: I need to give it there are a number of

00:19:55.918 --> 00:20:00.719
Caption: sizes for these code spaces as well so

00:19:58.199 --> 00:20:03.119
Caption: you can do you know two core machines up

00:20:00.719 --> 00:20:05.099
Caption: to I think it&#39;s 32 core if you ask us

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:07.079
Caption: nicely

00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:10.558
Caption: um I think by default you can do

00:20:07.079 --> 00:20:11.538
Caption: anything up to 32 core machines I

00:20:10.558 --> 00:20:14.159
Caption: believe

00:20:11.538 --> 00:20:16.678
Caption: and they get charged basically per

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.539
Caption: minute like so they get charged based on

00:20:16.678 --> 00:20:20.339
Caption: usage

00:20:18.538 --> 00:20:22.979
Caption: um the good thing as well is if you

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:24.119
Caption: leave them uh like you you log out and

00:20:22.979 --> 00:20:26.038
Caption: you don&#39;t do anything you don&#39;t stop

00:20:24.119 --> 00:20:27.780
Caption: them they&#39;ll stop themselves after a

00:20:26.038 --> 00:20:30.479
Caption: period of time I think by default it&#39;s

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.700
Caption: 20 or 30 minutes it&#39;ll stop itself we

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:35.699
Caption: did an internal survey because fun story

00:20:32.699 --> 00:20:38.899
Caption: GitHub GitHub so github.com which is a

00:20:35.699 --> 00:20:43.678
Caption: mono repo which is about 11 gig of code

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:45.539
Caption: we do github.com entirely in codespaces

00:20:43.678 --> 00:20:48.659
Caption: so we use this internally for our own

00:20:45.538 --> 00:20:51.359
Caption: gigantic repo using some features like

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.200
Caption: pre-builds so we can that&#39;s good

00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:56.400
Caption: um

00:20:52.199 --> 00:20:58.979
Caption: so using some features like pre-builds

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:02.580
Caption: we can get the speed of like starting a

00:20:58.979 --> 00:21:04.199
Caption: new code space up sorry down to really

00:21:02.579 --> 00:21:08.519
Caption: really small

00:21:04.199 --> 00:21:10.859
Caption: um small numbers so if this works

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:13.859
Caption: um I&#39;ll show you that in a sec but

00:21:10.859 --> 00:21:17.579
Caption: for github.com 11 gig code base about 23

00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:20.160
Caption: gig on disk if you do a deep clone it

00:21:17.579 --> 00:21:22.798
Caption: takes about I think it&#39;s about 10

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.960
Caption: seconds 10 12 seconds to go from

00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:27.538
Caption: clicking the button to being able to

00:21:24.959 --> 00:21:29.699
Caption: debug the code with multiple containers

00:21:27.538 --> 00:21:32.399
Caption: running different services in a

00:21:29.699 --> 00:21:34.619
Caption: debugging environment and you can commit

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.599
Caption: code and do that work straight away it&#39;s

00:21:34.619 --> 00:21:38.400
Caption: super powerful and it also means if

00:21:36.599 --> 00:21:39.780
Caption: somebody new joins the team they&#39;re just

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.940
Caption: create a new code space and they can

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.619
Caption: write code immediately if you start

00:21:41.939 --> 00:21:45.839
Caption: working on a different project

00:21:43.619 --> 00:21:48.839
Caption: and they have code spaces set up there

00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:50.219
Caption: you can go to that other project start a

00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:51.538
Caption: code space and now you have this brand

00:21:50.219 --> 00:21:53.400
Caption: new Dev machine that&#39;s targeted

00:21:51.538 --> 00:21:55.379
Caption: specifically at

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.280
Caption: um at that repository and at that code

00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:00.558
Caption: base

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.559
Caption: so here we go uh we are in

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:06.780
Caption: and this is my little application uh

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:10.140
Caption: let&#39;s see if I can run it in debug

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:12.659
Caption: it&#39;s a node app so I&#39;ll choose node

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:14.339
Caption: and remember this is all running just

00:22:12.659 --> 00:22:16.080
Caption: um through my browser I don&#39;t have this

00:22:14.339 --> 00:22:18.479
Caption: code base on this machine on this laptop

00:22:16.079 --> 00:22:20.939
Caption: at all not just

00:22:18.479 --> 00:22:22.739
Caption: yeah not just for the obvious reasons uh

00:22:20.939 --> 00:22:24.359
Caption: that it&#39;s not my laptop

00:22:22.739 --> 00:22:26.099
Caption: this actually makes the demo kind of

00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:27.959
Caption: cool right

00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:30.599
Caption: um you know I don&#39;t have the code on

00:22:27.959 --> 00:22:33.178
Caption: here because it&#39;s not my machine but I&#39;m

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:35.099
Caption: still able to to you know do the work to

00:22:33.178 --> 00:22:36.719
Caption: write the code so this is what the

00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:39.479
Caption: application looks like

00:22:36.719 --> 00:22:42.479
Caption: if I go back into my code space again in

00:22:39.479 --> 00:22:47.520
Caption: the browser and I find

00:22:42.479 --> 00:22:47.520
Caption: file let&#39;s find index.js

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:53.359
Caption: get rid of that and then I&#39;ll put a

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.359
Caption: break point on that render

00:22:53.579 --> 00:22:57.658
Caption: and refresh

00:22:55.558 --> 00:22:59.158
Caption: and in my other browser tab I&#39;ve hit

00:22:57.659 --> 00:23:00.960
Caption: this breakpoint and you get all of the

00:22:59.159 --> 00:23:04.020
Caption: nice stuff that you would normally get

00:23:00.959 --> 00:23:06.178
Caption: debugging in a vs code instance

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:09.780
Caption: um on somebody else&#39;s computer or on a

00:23:06.178 --> 00:23:12.359
Caption: Raspberry Pi wherever you are right

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.979
Caption: so pretty cool pretty cool stuff I was

00:23:12.359 --> 00:23:16.079
Caption: going to do a tiny little co-pilot demo

00:23:13.979 --> 00:23:19.500
Caption: but instead you should go and go to Mrs

00:23:16.079 --> 00:23:22.380
Caption: talk uh at 3 15 I think where she&#39;s

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:24.359
Caption: going to do co-pilot entirely but I was

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.219
Caption: going to like randomize those haikus but

00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:28.678
Caption: I don&#39;t remember how to do it so I would

00:23:26.219 --> 00:23:30.839
Caption: do something like yeah I need to install

00:23:28.678 --> 00:23:32.519
Caption: copilot so I&#39;m not going to do it just

00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:34.979
Caption: ask copilot to tell me how to randomize

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:37.558
Caption: in node because I don&#39;t know

00:23:34.979 --> 00:23:39.839
Caption: right so that&#39;s code spaces it&#39;s super

00:23:37.558 --> 00:23:41.640
Caption: powerful you can also connect remotely

00:23:39.839 --> 00:23:44.158
Caption: from a visual studio code instance on

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.320
Caption: your local machine if you want to

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:49.380
Caption: um you can stop them start them

00:23:46.319 --> 00:23:50.658
Caption: disconnect and have multiple running at

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.400
Caption: the same time

00:23:50.659 --> 00:23:55.679
Caption: so if you are doing some work for one

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.359
Caption: particular branch of your code you can

00:23:55.678 --> 00:23:59.880
Caption: have a code space open for that and

00:23:57.359 --> 00:24:03.418
Caption: another one for the main one and so on

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.099
Caption: um and as I said Dev stop themselves if

00:24:03.418 --> 00:24:07.380
Caption: you&#39;re not using them we did a little

00:24:05.099 --> 00:24:09.298
Caption: survey internally for GitHub GitHub to

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.440
Caption: find out how often people

00:24:09.298 --> 00:24:12.538
Caption: um

00:24:10.439 --> 00:24:14.279
Caption: how often people actually stopped the

00:24:12.538 --> 00:24:15.178
Caption: code spaces themselves or how often they

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.739
Caption: just like

00:24:15.178 --> 00:24:19.739
Caption: turn their computer off and waited for

00:24:16.739 --> 00:24:21.479
Caption: it to stop itself and it was uh

00:24:19.739 --> 00:24:23.520
Caption: approximately there might be a little

00:24:21.479 --> 00:24:24.959
Caption: bit of counting error approximately a

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.280
Caption: hundred percent of people didn&#39;t turn it

00:24:24.959 --> 00:24:28.279
Caption: off they just let it expire

00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:31.739
Caption: yeah

00:24:29.339 --> 00:24:33.119
Caption: yeah so one yeah that&#39;s a very good

00:24:31.739 --> 00:24:34.260
Caption: point I overheard there which is that&#39;s

00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:37.079
Caption: because they work at GitHub and they

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:38.159
Caption: don&#39;t pay for these which is true I did

00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:39.599
Caption: a little back of the envelope

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:42.900
Caption: calculation and if you&#39;re running I

00:24:39.599 --> 00:24:44.158
Caption: think it&#39;s a 16 core machine or

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.760
Caption: something like that and you&#39;re working

00:24:44.159 --> 00:24:49.260
Caption: eight hours a day of 50 weeks a year or

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.380
Caption: 48 weeks a year or something like that

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:54.479
Caption: it&#39;s about equivalent to buying a new

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:56.280
Caption: laptop every two years or something like

00:24:54.479 --> 00:24:58.020
Caption: that but remember you&#39;ve got these code

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.820
Caption: spaces that you can have

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.859
Caption: in all of these different environments

00:24:59.819 --> 00:25:03.658
Caption: and they just don&#39;t charge you for usage

00:25:01.859 --> 00:25:05.280
Caption: when they&#39;re shut down so you could have

00:25:03.659 --> 00:25:07.200
Caption: 30 projects that you&#39;re working on with

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.599
Caption: 30 different code spaces that you can

00:25:07.199 --> 00:25:11.339
Caption: start working on immediately from any

00:25:09.599 --> 00:25:13.558
Caption: laptop you have it doesn&#39;t need to be

00:25:11.339 --> 00:25:15.719
Caption: new you should definitely have the

00:25:13.558 --> 00:25:16.558
Caption: newest best laptop though that&#39;s a good

00:25:15.719 --> 00:25:18.178
Caption: idea

00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:20.339
Caption: yeah

00:25:18.178 --> 00:25:22.439
Caption: so uh

00:25:20.339 --> 00:25:23.880
Caption: I&#39;m running low on time as well so we&#39;re

00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:25.859
Caption: going to move very quickly to the next

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.659
Caption: bit so that&#39;s kind of our inner loop

00:25:25.859 --> 00:25:29.400
Caption: that&#39;s a Dev environment that means that

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:32.220
Caption: I can write my code really quickly I can

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.539
Caption: get started on new projects and I don&#39;t

00:25:32.219 --> 00:25:35.158
Caption: have to worry so much about the hardware

00:25:33.538 --> 00:25:37.199
Caption: or the dependencies running on my local

00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:38.640
Caption: machine super powerful but then when I

00:25:37.199 --> 00:25:40.859
Caption: have made the change how do I get that

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.359
Caption: into production and this is one of the

00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:44.278
Caption: probably better known features I guess

00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:46.319
Caption: of GitHub which is GitHub actions who

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:48.900
Caption: who uses GitHub actions

00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:50.579
Caption: okay probably about half the room who&#39;s

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.099
Caption: heard of GitHub actions like who&#39;s aware

00:25:50.579 --> 00:25:54.959
Caption: of it the same people

00:25:53.099 --> 00:25:56.339
Caption: um

00:25:54.959 --> 00:25:57.658
Caption: well now the rest of you have heard

00:25:56.339 --> 00:25:59.400
Caption: about it so you can move into the next

00:25:57.659 --> 00:26:01.020
Caption: column of using it

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.159
Caption: um rather than actually run one of these

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.239
Caption: I&#39;m going to show you one I&#39;ve run

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:05.460
Caption: before

00:26:03.239 --> 00:26:07.020
Caption: so uh the great thing about GitHub

00:26:05.459 --> 00:26:08.880
Caption: actions is the definition of how to

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:11.700
Caption: build your application and how to deploy

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.979
Caption: your application is defined in a yaml

00:26:11.699 --> 00:26:15.899
Caption: file that sits alongside your code

00:26:13.979 --> 00:26:17.939
Caption: so when somebody clones or Forks your

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.679
Caption: repository they know not just what the

00:26:17.939 --> 00:26:21.538
Caption: code looks like but what the build

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:24.178
Caption: situation is and what the deployment

00:26:21.538 --> 00:26:26.058
Caption: situation is they can see all of that if

00:26:24.178 --> 00:26:28.678
Caption: you&#39;ve got a specific code space

00:26:26.058 --> 00:26:31.199
Caption: definition set up so you can customize

00:26:28.678 --> 00:26:33.058
Caption: those code spaces in huge ways they also

00:26:31.199 --> 00:26:35.579
Caption: know what the dev machine needs to look

00:26:33.058 --> 00:26:37.640
Caption: like as well whether you&#39;re using Code

00:26:35.579 --> 00:26:40.019
Caption: spaces or Dev containers just locally

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.880
Caption: you know what it you know everything

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.260
Caption: about that project you have the code you

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.418
Caption: have the definition of how you&#39;re going

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:47.339
Caption: to like write code against it like what

00:26:45.418 --> 00:26:48.839
Caption: dependencies you need and then you have

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:50.400
Caption: the definition of how you build it and

00:26:48.839 --> 00:26:52.739
Caption: how you deploy it and it&#39;s just all

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.919
Caption: there in your Repository

00:26:52.739 --> 00:26:57.719
Caption: uh this is kind of a more mature looking

00:26:55.918 --> 00:27:00.178
Caption: pipeline we&#39;ve got three stages here I&#39;m

00:26:57.719 --> 00:27:02.939
Caption: going to try and zoom in a bit I don&#39;t

00:27:00.178 --> 00:27:04.678
Caption: think this seems great here there we go

00:27:02.939 --> 00:27:07.259
Caption: we&#39;ve got three stages here

00:27:04.678 --> 00:27:09.899
Caption: we&#39;ve got a build stage which does my

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:12.959
Caption: compilation and we have a deployment

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:15.059
Caption: stage which deploys to Azure in this

00:27:12.959 --> 00:27:16.619
Caption: case and then we have a production stage

00:27:15.058 --> 00:27:18.239
Caption: now the thing that I&#39;ve set up with

00:27:16.619 --> 00:27:19.979
Caption: production is it knows the production

00:27:18.239 --> 00:27:21.239
Caption: environment needs approvals before it

00:27:19.979 --> 00:27:23.219
Caption: goes to production

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:25.260
Caption: so by saying in that definition I am

00:27:23.219 --> 00:27:27.538
Caption: deploying to production you get this

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.859
Caption: protection where it has to pass a bunch

00:27:27.538 --> 00:27:32.038
Caption: of rules before it&#39;s allowed to go into

00:27:28.859 --> 00:27:33.599
Caption: production in this case that rule is I

00:27:32.038 --> 00:27:35.038
Caption: need to approve that before it goes into

00:27:33.599 --> 00:27:36.719
Caption: production

00:27:35.038 --> 00:27:39.239
Caption: you can put other rules in there like

00:27:36.719 --> 00:27:42.000
Caption: you can only deploy to this environment

00:27:39.239 --> 00:27:44.400
Caption: from these branches of your repository

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.439
Caption: so maybe you&#39;re doing a branching

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.479
Caption: strategy where it&#39;s a trunk-based

00:27:46.439 --> 00:27:50.278
Caption: development and people do feature

00:27:48.479 --> 00:27:51.900
Caption: branches but then they merge back into

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:53.520
Caption: your main branch before it goes out to

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.140
Caption: production you want to make sure nobody

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.820
Caption: deploys to production from a feature

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.558
Caption: Branch right so you can put that

00:27:56.819 --> 00:27:59.699
Caption: protection on it as well and nobody can

00:27:58.558 --> 00:28:01.199
Caption: actually approve that to go to

00:27:59.699 --> 00:28:03.599
Caption: production

00:28:01.199 --> 00:28:06.000
Caption: so this went to the staging site it went

00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:08.760
Caption: to the production site we&#39;ve got a track

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.279
Caption: of the deployments like the reviews

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.419
Caption: sorry who did a review and then we&#39;ve

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:14.100
Caption: even got the artifacts that were

00:28:12.418 --> 00:28:16.019
Caption: produced as well so part of the build

00:28:14.099 --> 00:28:18.058
Caption: was packaging everything up and then

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:20.219
Caption: uploading it so the subsequent jobs

00:28:18.058 --> 00:28:21.899
Caption: could pull that down and do the work

00:28:20.219 --> 00:28:24.359
Caption: actually deployed them as well

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.460
Caption: the way these actually physically run is

00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:29.339
Caption: on these ones are on GitHub hosted

00:28:26.459 --> 00:28:32.219
Caption: Runners so these are agents that

00:28:29.339 --> 00:28:34.979
Caption: basically spin up when you when there&#39;s

00:28:32.219 --> 00:28:36.599
Caption: a job to do it&#39;ll download the code or

00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:38.880
Caption: do whatever you want it to do

00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:40.859
Caption: and then when it&#39;s finished it&#39;ll tear

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.959
Caption: itself down entirely so they&#39;re on

00:28:40.859 --> 00:28:45.538
Caption: demand kind of hosted Runners you can

00:28:42.959 --> 00:28:47.158
Caption: also self-host Runners if you want you

00:28:45.538 --> 00:28:49.859
Caption: can run the running the runner

00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:52.140
Caption: executable on pretty much any machine

00:28:49.859 --> 00:28:54.000
Caption: I&#39;ve run them on Raspberry Piers too so

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.859
Caption: you can actually build your application

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.599
Caption: on a Raspberry Pi if you really want to

00:28:55.859 --> 00:28:59.400
Caption: don&#39;t do that

00:28:57.599 --> 00:29:01.500
Caption: um or you can do the GitHub host at ones

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.839
Caption: really new to GitHub hosted Runners as

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.699
Caption: well is the larger sizes of GitHub

00:29:03.839 --> 00:29:07.319
Caption: hosted Runners so for for a very long

00:29:05.699 --> 00:29:08.880
Caption: time you didn&#39;t get to choose how big

00:29:07.319 --> 00:29:12.058
Caption: those Runners were the only way to

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:14.039
Caption: choose how much RAM and all that kind of

00:29:12.058 --> 00:29:17.459
Caption: stuff was to do your self-hosted ones

00:29:14.038 --> 00:29:21.139
Caption: now for GitHub team I believe and GitHub

00:29:17.459 --> 00:29:24.178
Caption: Enterprise Cloud you can set up

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:27.479
Caption: larger hosted Runners to say I want you

00:29:24.178 --> 00:29:28.619
Caption: know one with 32 cores and gpus and all

00:29:27.479 --> 00:29:32.278
Caption: sorts of stuff

00:29:28.619 --> 00:29:34.020
Caption: so uh yeah long-running builds or ones

00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:35.700
Caption: that are a bit slow uh you can do use

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.839
Caption: hosted Runners for those

00:29:35.699 --> 00:29:38.760
Caption: now

00:29:36.839 --> 00:29:41.520
Caption: there is a lot that I didn&#39;t cover in

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:43.380
Caption: this for several reasons

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.080
Caption: um if you want to see any of this stuff

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.579
Caption: in a little bit more detail we&#39;ve got

00:29:46.079 --> 00:29:49.619
Caption: demos at the booth we&#39;ve got an awesome

00:29:47.579 --> 00:29:52.380
Caption: demo that was actually written by Aaron

00:29:49.619 --> 00:29:55.260
Caption: Powell who is probably in that room

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:57.418
Caption: um which has a code space with multiple

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.880
Caption: containers that get run and debug at the

00:29:57.418 --> 00:30:02.278
Caption: same time with Azure Cosmos DB emulators

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.839
Caption: running in them and the actual device

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:05.460
Caption: that I&#39;ve the keyboard and mouse is

00:30:03.839 --> 00:30:08.278
Caption: connected to is this little Raspberry Pi

00:30:05.459 --> 00:30:10.619
Caption: but it&#39;s running 32 cores in the

00:30:08.279 --> 00:30:12.720
Caption: background and 32 gigs of ram in code

00:30:10.619 --> 00:30:15.599
Caption: spaces and things like that we use

00:30:12.719 --> 00:30:17.158
Caption: GitHub issues for our prize draw as well

00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:18.898
Caption: if you haven&#39;t signed up for that so if

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:20.399
Caption: you go to a particular GitHub issue you

00:30:18.899 --> 00:30:22.320
Caption: can leave a comment and then we use

00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:24.659
Caption: GitHub actions to pull the names from

00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:27.000
Caption: the names of the people who commented on

00:30:24.659 --> 00:30:28.500
Caption: that issue put them in a file and do

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.659
Caption: that as part of the deployment to GitHub

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.459
Caption: pages that I also didn&#39;t mention which

00:30:30.659 --> 00:30:34.980
Caption: is a way you can host your own static

00:30:32.459 --> 00:30:36.658
Caption: websites in GitHub so the whole thing

00:30:34.979 --> 00:30:38.579
Caption: like kind of fits together until you get

00:30:36.659 --> 00:30:40.260
Caption: this end-to-end scenario

00:30:38.579 --> 00:30:42.959
Caption: so planning and tracking with GitHub

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:44.279
Caption: issues and GitHub projects code spaces

00:30:42.959 --> 00:30:46.020
Caption: for that inner loop of actually doing

00:30:44.279 --> 00:30:48.299
Caption: development really quickly and really

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:50.520
Caption: efficiently especially for new people to

00:30:48.298 --> 00:30:52.619
Caption: the team and then GitHub actions which

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:55.679
Caption: is an automation platform that kind of

00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:57.359
Caption: lets you do your CI CD or kind of any

00:30:55.678 --> 00:30:59.640
Caption: other automation as well but

00:30:57.359 --> 00:31:01.739
Caption: fantastic for CI CD and we&#39;ve got most

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.058
Caption: of the way around there until we get

00:31:01.739 --> 00:31:04.678
Caption: back to issues again which is the

00:31:03.058 --> 00:31:06.959
Caption: learning from what&#39;s in production

00:31:04.678 --> 00:31:08.219
Caption: as I said tons of stuff I didn&#39;t see I

00:31:06.959 --> 00:31:10.678
Caption: didn&#39;t tell you about

00:31:08.219 --> 00:31:12.058
Caption: um come over to the booth and ask some

00:31:10.678 --> 00:31:14.038
Caption: of us for some demos of the stuff that&#39;s

00:31:12.058 --> 00:31:16.278
Caption: there and otherwise thanks so much for

00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:16.278
Caption: your time

00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:26.699
Caption: and thanks Mish for the laptop

00:31:24.239 --> 00:31:30.058
Caption: thanks Damian that was really cool

00:31:26.699 --> 00:31:31.859
Caption: um so it&#39;s off to lunch now everybody uh

00:31:30.058 --> 00:31:34.699
Caption: so there&#39;s lunchtime sessions commencing

00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:34.699
Caption: at 2 35
