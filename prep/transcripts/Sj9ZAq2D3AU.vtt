00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:22.110
Caption: everyone so if anyone doesn&#39;t know me my

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.669
Caption: name is Michelle Sanford I work at

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:30.659
Caption: Microsoft and I am also the chairman of

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.399
Caption: their ACS in Wi if you don&#39;t know what

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.279
Caption: that is you should come and talk to me

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:39.569
Caption: afterwards or George who is my vice

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:42.148
Caption: chair or in fact Rebecca who is chairman

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:47.130
Caption: of DD deep earth and is also vice chair

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:51.719
Caption: I would say thanks to our amazing

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:54.659
Caption: sponsors of which Microsoft is one of

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.510
Caption: them and so is ace yes but we couldn&#39;t

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.810
Caption: really 1 DDD worth if it wasn&#39;t for all

00:00:57.509 --> 00:01:03.359
Caption: of them but it has doubled in numbers

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.149
Caption: every single year it&#39;s it&#39;s so exciting

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.250
Caption: and I&#39;m hoping next year it will be at

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.990
Caption: house and because there were eight

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:18.229
Caption: hundreds of trying to register for this

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:22.559
Caption: one today okay so I started this journey

00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:25.728
Caption: by seeing something about the hundred

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:30.599
Caption: days of Cade challenge and I thought

00:01:25.728 --> 00:01:33.258
Caption: could I raise a robot army if I had no

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:36.328
Caption: instruction and no prior knowledge and

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:41.130
Caption: the only thing that I knew was I needed

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:47.539
Caption: to spend an hour a day in the code this

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:53.429
Caption: is my this is the story how possible is

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:57.329
Caption: so I I did the first thing I asked the

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:59.069
Caption: internet how to do it it turns out that

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.420
Caption: I am not the only one asking the

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:06.749
Caption: internet that and also the cheapest way

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:09.149
Caption: to raise a robot army is to just pay

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:11.250
Caption: like a couple hundred dollars and you

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.490
Caption: can get an army of Russian bots to help

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.610
Caption: you they go over the world

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:21.559
Caption: so that&#39;s one way I didn&#39;t go with that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.768
Caption: well we&#39;ll go with what I went with

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:28.500
Caption: so with Fight Club

00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:31.529
Caption: the first rule of Fight Club is you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.598
Caption: don&#39;t talk about Fight Club and the

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:36.750
Caption: second rule of Fight Club is that you

00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:39.208
Caption: don&#39;t talk about Fight Club that is not

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.268
Caption: the case with hundred days of code there

00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:45.720
Caption: are only two rules but they are kind of

00:02:42.268 --> 00:02:47.970
Caption: the opposite to that so what that means

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:53.009
Caption: is you have a lot of freedom to do

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.798
Caption: everyone with your hundred days a lot of

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:58.378
Caption: people were scared of the hundred days

00:02:55.798 --> 00:03:01.789
Caption: of code website and it will point them

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:05.369
Caption: at free code camp and so you can start

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:07.048
Caption: just following those tutorials and at

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:09.449
Caption: the end of your hundred days you will be

00:03:07.048 --> 00:03:14.339
Caption: a phone and web developer which is a

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:16.798
Caption: pretty good outcome but I kind of

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:20.970
Caption: thought I want to do I want to do

00:03:16.798 --> 00:03:24.149
Caption: something with BOTS and I want to do

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.190
Caption: something with Python so that was all I

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:29.479
Caption: really had in my mind at the start of

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.279
Caption: hundred days um

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:34.078
Caption: you don&#39;t need a lot to get started

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:36.958
Caption: there were a lot of tools out there that

00:03:34.078 --> 00:03:40.979
Caption: will help you just code in a web browser

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:42.660
Caption: and will give you a sandbox and you can

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:45.449
Caption: do all sorts of tutorials without

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.480
Caption: setting anything up at all but if you

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:52.259
Caption: want to really do something these are

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:55.559
Caption: kind of what I found is the the basis so

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:58.918
Caption: I need to get hub Visual Studio code and

00:03:55.559 --> 00:04:01.410
Caption: Heroku there&#39;s all free so you have to

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:05.930
Caption: pay anything then you do not have to use

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:09.510
Caption: those particular ones but they are

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:11.128
Caption: probably the most common but you know

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:13.828
Caption: there are a lot of the options out there

00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:20.070
Caption: these are what I what I really liked and

00:04:13.828 --> 00:04:22.470
Caption: what I used so the first rule of hundred

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.710
Caption: a decade is you have to spend an hour a

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.610
Caption: day in the code and initially when I was

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:32.039
Caption: pretty new to coding I thought how am I

00:04:29.609 --> 00:04:33.779
Caption: going to spend an hour in the code is

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.209
Caption: going to be too long

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:37.889
Caption: and I thought well I&#39;d better find

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:40.319
Caption: something that will help me track

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.360
Caption: whether I&#39;ve spent an hour so I built

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.660
Caption: this little thing and it just tells me

00:04:42.359 --> 00:04:50.299
Caption: the key coding until an hour of gotten

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.300
Caption: and then at the end it says stop coding

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.220
Caption: it&#39;s not super accurate so you know

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:03.150
Caption: you&#39;d probably be better looking at your

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:05.309
Caption: watch but if you let it go like this you

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:09.299
Caption: will definitely have done more than an

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:12.869
Caption: hour in the code because it will it will

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:20.159
Caption: probably sort of pause more than it will

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:23.609
Caption: speed up like you won&#39;t speed up the

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:28.290
Caption: second rule is that you should tweet

00:05:23.609 --> 00:05:30.149
Caption: your progress every day so in the

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.950
Caption: beginning you kind of feel stupid

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:34.380
Caption: because you think I haven&#39;t done

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.590
Caption: anything or what I&#39;ve done is all gone

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.290
Caption: wrong or what I&#39;ve done make no sense or

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:42.209
Caption: you know all of that stuff and you&#39;re

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.420
Caption: just kind of you&#39;re tweeting out and

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:48.410
Caption: you&#39;re just thinking but the hub

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:53.250
Caption: community is really very supportive and

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.690
Caption: they will you will get many retweets for

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.929
Caption: those things that have the hashtag

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.690
Caption: hundred days okay dinner and you will

00:05:57.929 --> 00:06:03.119
Caption: get some people to eating back at you

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.410
Caption: saying keep at it well done you know

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:10.859
Caption: keep going which is really nice I think

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:13.380
Caption: as I went on I found that the more

00:06:10.859 --> 00:06:15.479
Caption: useful thing to do would be to if you

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.600
Caption: make mistakes you should share those

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.050
Caption: mistakes so that people don&#39;t feel like

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.709
Caption: when they look at your Instagram feel

00:06:21.049 --> 00:06:27.690
Caption: Instagram feed it&#39;s just a beautiful

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:32.609
Caption: perfect life where all your coding is

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:34.709
Caption: glorious but you should also when you do

00:06:32.609 --> 00:06:36.239
Caption: have glorious code you should also tweet

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:38.970
Caption: about that too because you want to

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:41.509
Caption: celebrate successes as well as laughs

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:45.029
Caption: for your own mistakes

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:47.489
Caption: so there are only two rules and hundred

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:52.079
Caption: ISO code but there are some more things

00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:55.408
Caption: that are not exactly rules um give

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:58.079
Caption: before shoutouts is one of them so when

00:06:55.408 --> 00:06:59.459
Caption: someone has helped you of something or

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:03.299
Caption: when you&#39;ve seen something that you

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:06.149
Caption: think is really good then he should you

00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:09.269
Caption: should read about that too so I learned

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:12.299
Caption: a lot about Python from Nina she brought

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:14.279
Caption: up her from and they she put up her

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:17.009
Caption: iPhone courses fundamentals and

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:21.359
Caption: intermediate on front-end masters for

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:24.690
Caption: free for I don&#39;t know how long like 14

00:07:21.359 --> 00:07:27.119
Caption: days or something so I got through most

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.919
Caption: of those before the free period ran out

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:30.989
Caption: and then by the time it was into the

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.690
Caption: free period I thought I&#39;m gonna buy a

00:07:30.989 --> 00:07:36.869
Caption: subscription the front landmasses

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:38.309
Caption: because her courses were so good and you

00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:40.109
Caption: want to know if you&#39;re going to invest

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:41.699
Caption: in yourselves you want to know that the

00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:43.918
Caption: training you&#39;re investing in is worth

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:46.619
Caption: something so if you find something like

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:53.339
Caption: that then share that and say that you

00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:56.429
Caption: think it&#39;s good so there are only two

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:59.519
Caption: rules in a hundred rules of a hit but

00:07:56.429 --> 00:08:02.519
Caption: there are more things the first thing I

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:05.158
Caption: discovered is that you really need to

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:07.138
Caption: have a plan because otherwise you start

00:08:05.158 --> 00:08:10.079
Caption: on day one and you don&#39;t know what you

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:12.080
Caption: do at all it bit me like the whole day

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:16.619
Caption: the whole day Saturday to just download

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:19.758
Caption: Python and all of the libraries and all

00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:22.408
Caption: of the extra things that you needed and

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:25.049
Caption: yes I thought I&#39;m not going to record

00:08:22.408 --> 00:08:28.559
Caption: that as day one or recorder as day zero

00:08:25.049 --> 00:08:31.039
Caption: and and then later on I realized that

00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:39.270
Caption: recording it as Daisy reg was a more

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:41.429
Caption: programmatic thing to do um I mentioned

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.890
Caption: using gear up earlier and when I first

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:45.659
Caption: started using github I didn&#39;t really

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.940
Caption: know what it was apart from it seemed

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:50.159
Caption: like a really cool thing to me and I

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:53.388
Caption: knew that Microsoft had bought it so

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:56.398
Caption: but it&#39;s probably worth something um

00:08:53.388 --> 00:08:59.250
Caption: luckily when you don&#39;t know how to use

00:08:56.398 --> 00:09:01.768
Caption: github they have a bot that will teach

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.969
Caption: you how to use github and I thought well

00:09:01.768 --> 00:09:04.739
Caption: this is good because I want to learn

00:09:02.969 --> 00:09:08.338
Caption: about books and the body is gonna teach

00:09:04.739 --> 00:09:10.739
Caption: me do so he will teach you for free and

00:09:08.338 --> 00:09:13.378
Caption: then after you have learnt how to use

00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:16.258
Caption: github from the but you could actually

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:20.399
Caption: learn how to build a bot of your own

00:09:16.258 --> 00:09:23.128
Caption: using github as well so I did the first

00:09:20.398 --> 00:09:26.549
Caption: ones I learned were at github bots that

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:32.009
Caption: sort of reply to comments and things

00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:35.789
Caption: like that it&#39;s pretty cool oh yeah that

00:09:32.008 --> 00:09:39.179
Caption: whole the repo and commit the look

00:09:35.789 --> 00:09:42.148
Caption: thing yeah that was that was like a

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:44.338
Caption: foreign language first of all when I

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:47.250
Caption: heard someone&#39;s like that where they

00:09:44.338 --> 00:09:48.838
Caption: just go into github and walk my repo and

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:56.880
Caption: then you&#39;ll be fine and I was just like

00:09:48.838 --> 00:10:00.919
Caption: what yeah I mean it&#39;s super easy I do

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.919
Caption: that idea the forking all the time now

00:10:04.429 --> 00:10:10.528
Caption: yeah I wrote a thing about this because

00:10:07.528 --> 00:10:12.479
Caption: this is this is important so is it

00:10:10.528 --> 00:10:14.938
Caption: developed for its best practice not only

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:17.489
Caption: to anticipate what also to prepare for

00:10:14.939 --> 00:10:19.500
Caption: errors so we&#39;re not usually done through

00:10:17.489 --> 00:10:21.599
Caption: some sort of mechanism typically called

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.489
Caption: a fallback and most programming

00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:26.250
Caption: languages have some sort of key word

00:10:23.489 --> 00:10:28.648
Caption: along the lines of try and catch so the

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.750
Caption: logic being dry some code and if that

00:10:28.648 --> 00:10:33.568
Caption: doesn&#39;t work ouch the error and then

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:36.000
Caption: handle it for your user so you&#39;re you

00:10:33.568 --> 00:10:40.799
Caption: fall back to that error handling case um

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.068
Caption: I wanted to have a fun full back a from

00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:46.438
Caption: default in case I got home from work and

00:10:44.068 --> 00:10:49.258
Caption: fell exhausted and like I didn&#39;t want to

00:10:46.439 --> 00:10:53.130
Caption: spend an hour in a code and that was

00:10:49.258 --> 00:10:57.969
Caption: very often the case

00:10:53.130 --> 00:11:01.750
Caption: so what we have here is Kate combats how

00:10:57.969 --> 00:11:06.398
Caption: many of you have played this not many

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:09.429
Caption: how many of you have kids well all of

00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:11.349
Caption: you that kids definitely play this and

00:11:09.429 --> 00:11:16.898
Caption: all of you that don&#39;t have kids should

00:11:11.349 --> 00:11:19.838
Caption: definitely play this is a platformer it

00:11:16.898 --> 00:11:22.630
Caption: doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s not an app it&#39;s a web

00:11:19.838 --> 00:11:24.130
Caption: thing so you can&#39;t really do it from

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:27.309
Caption: your phone but you can do it from your

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:32.020
Caption: laptop you can do it for free first of

00:11:27.309 --> 00:11:35.830
Caption: all for a lot levels I paid the $99

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:38.588
Caption: lifetime subscription because it has

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:41.049
Caption: hundreds and hundreds of apples and four

00:11:38.588 --> 00:11:43.750
Caption: different worlds and you can go through

00:11:41.049 --> 00:11:46.000
Caption: the whole thing to learn Python and then

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.739
Caption: you can wipe it and go back to the start

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.809
Caption: and learn the whole thing in JavaScript

00:11:47.739 --> 00:11:55.270
Caption: so it&#39;s definitely worth it it teaches

00:11:52.809 --> 00:11:57.760
Caption: you to code by playing a game so like

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.920
Caption: first one that you try is just like one

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.109
Caption: line and then it&#39;s two lines of code and

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:07.690
Caption: then it&#39;s three lines of code this is

00:12:02.109 --> 00:12:10.328
Caption: obviously a very simple code but like

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:13.929
Caption: really really long and as you progress

00:12:10.328 --> 00:12:16.359
Caption: it incentivizes you to shut down your

00:12:13.929 --> 00:12:19.328
Caption: code so that instead of it being like 20

00:12:16.359 --> 00:12:21.369
Caption: or 30 lines there if you could do it in

00:12:19.328 --> 00:12:22.059
Caption: five lines that would give you a high

00:12:21.369 --> 00:12:23.950
Caption: reward

00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:26.049
Caption: but it doesn&#39;t expect you to do that at

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:29.290
Caption: the beginning so it&#39;s it&#39;s very nice and

00:12:26.049 --> 00:12:32.708
Caption: it sort of wines on your brain other one

00:12:29.289 --> 00:12:35.588
Caption: is solar learn that is an app you can

00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:37.599
Caption: get on your phone and you can play that

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:39.398
Caption: you know when you&#39;re walking along the

00:12:37.599 --> 00:12:43.059
Caption: street when you&#39;re on your commute not

00:12:39.398 --> 00:12:44.890
Caption: if you&#39;re the driver but if you only

00:12:43.059 --> 00:12:48.130
Caption: really know something other passenger

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:51.278
Caption: and it&#39;s not as much fun as Kade combat

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:53.500
Caption: but it is it does have like little tests

00:12:51.278 --> 00:12:58.778
Caption: and challenges and things so it teaches

00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:03.750
Caption: you basics this one I did have it

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:03.750
Caption: playing the beautiful music

00:13:03.789 --> 00:13:15.199
Caption: what&#39;s it from gravity my children&#39;s

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:19.160
Caption: wicked from wicked yeah but it&#39;s not

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:22.730
Caption: playing it for us now but anyway yeah

00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:25.639
Caption: why did I choose Python is this because

00:13:22.729 --> 00:13:29.209
Caption: it&#39;s magic is one of the reasons because

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:32.690
Caption: it&#39;s symbol because it&#39;s fun because it

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:35.200
Caption: comes with batteries included so that&#39;s

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:37.970
Caption: like they they say to sort of summarize

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.830
Caption: it has a little libraries built in so

00:13:37.969 --> 00:13:43.159
Caption: that you can do stuff without actually

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:46.369
Caption: writing all the code for it and also it

00:13:43.159 --> 00:13:48.949
Caption: has hidden easter s in it so this one of

00:13:46.369 --> 00:13:52.460
Caption: the easter eggs if you type in port and

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:58.250
Caption: gravity from the command line it brings

00:13:52.460 --> 00:14:00.350
Caption: up this little cartoon there what I

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:03.320
Caption: learned was that there were pretty much

00:14:00.349 --> 00:14:06.169
Caption: two kinds of jackpot that you could

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.570
Caption: build there&#39;s one that sort of rules

00:14:06.169 --> 00:14:11.269
Caption: based and it follows the rules those

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:13.640
Caption: rules can get like complex or it can be

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:20.119
Caption: very simple and then there&#39;s ones that

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:22.369
Caption: will learn for themselves so I started

00:14:20.119 --> 00:14:25.429
Caption: from the very beginning weird scratch

00:14:22.369 --> 00:14:26.989
Caption: which is what kids learn from when

00:14:25.429 --> 00:14:30.229
Caption: you&#39;re seven years of age you could

00:14:26.989 --> 00:14:32.149
Caption: learn scratch and I thought I should

00:14:30.229 --> 00:14:36.889
Caption: learn how to make a look at what in that

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:41.510
Caption: the the blocks teach kids the logic of

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:44.150
Caption: coding and so it&#39;s sort of a when

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:47.179
Caption: someone clicks this then you do that

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:51.860
Caption: when someone says this then you do that

00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:53.929
Caption: and just sing the blocks clarifies in

00:14:51.859 --> 00:14:56.359
Caption: their mind how coding really works and

00:14:53.929 --> 00:14:58.760
Caption: they can move straight from scratch into

00:14:56.359 --> 00:15:06.469
Caption: Python which is what I wanted to go so I

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:10.369
Caption: thought I&#39;ll start there so this is a

00:15:06.469 --> 00:15:12.319
Caption: Snickers playing with Cody blocky

00:15:10.369 --> 00:15:15.559
Caption: I thought I should have a actual

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:19.609
Caption: physical but in order to really

00:15:15.559 --> 00:15:21.909
Caption: satisfies the robot army thing so I

00:15:19.609 --> 00:15:24.409
Caption: brought Cody blocky on the internet and

00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:29.149
Caption: it is something that you can program

00:15:24.409 --> 00:15:31.399
Caption: with again these Cody blocks or you can

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:34.070
Caption: also then switch over to Python and

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:38.450
Caption: teach it to do more complex stuff using

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:40.910
Caption: that Snickers was pressing the button

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:44.540
Caption: there and when she presses the button it

00:15:40.909 --> 00:15:46.639
Caption: when&#39;s the gate she was doing that

00:15:44.539 --> 00:15:55.039
Caption: pretty old there but later on my hand

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:57.470
Caption: are just chewing the bar which so I made

00:15:55.039 --> 00:16:01.039
Caption: a thicker box which is modeled on

00:15:57.469 --> 00:16:05.329
Caption: Snickers if you how many of you have to

00:16:01.039 --> 00:16:10.789
Caption: go if you find her on Twitter right now

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:14.900
Caption: you could tweet her so her thing is at

00:16:10.789 --> 00:16:19.969
Caption: BOTS liquor and if you tweet her using

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:23.690
Caption: either the hashtag DDD Perth or what&#39;s

00:16:19.969 --> 00:16:26.029
Caption: rising then she should reply to you if

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:28.820
Caption: you do not have the hashtags in there

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:31.880
Caption: she will not reply to you if you put

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:34.039
Caption: both of them in there that would be okay

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:38.239
Caption: it doesn&#39;t drive her crazy I have tested

00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:40.759
Caption: that this morning if you reply on one of

00:16:38.239 --> 00:16:43.070
Caption: the relies or one of the tweets that

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:48.109
Caption: also doesn&#39;t drive her crazy we&#39;re

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:52.400
Caption: totally fine so yeah feel free to tweet

00:16:48.109 --> 00:16:54.979
Caption: and she will hopefully tweet back all

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:59.960
Caption: going well she does sometimes go rogue

00:16:54.979 --> 00:17:02.750
Caption: but generally generally not today I hope

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:05.300
Caption: because I didn&#39;t want our scattering

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:07.939
Caption: work so I didn&#39;t leave her just running

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:12.100
Caption: generically in the cloud I have earned

00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:12.099
Caption: my control right here I

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:21.380
Caption: so I initially got the basic paid for

00:17:17.448 --> 00:17:23.359
Caption: that buy from this guy he has a really

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:28.670
Caption: nice video that taught me how to build

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:30.530
Caption: my first Twitter bot and yeah it&#39;s a

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:32.540
Caption: really nice video and its really clear

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:35.030
Caption: and its really explicit and even though

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:38.869
Caption: I think it&#39;s more than a year old it

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:41.119
Caption: still works which is a problem with code

00:17:38.869 --> 00:17:43.400
Caption: and with cloud a lot of stuff that you

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:46.369
Caption: follow in tutorials is out of date in

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:51.049
Caption: about five seconds but this one&#39;s good

00:17:46.369 --> 00:17:53.750
Caption: one so this is their code

00:17:51.048 --> 00:17:57.319
Caption: that pretty much the code that I used

00:17:53.750 --> 00:18:00.890
Caption: and no in fact that is the whole program

00:17:57.319 --> 00:18:04.880
Caption: so it doesn&#39;t need any more than that to

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:06.979
Caption: run that Twitter bot so all it does here

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:11.109
Caption: is when you tweet to it

00:18:06.979 --> 00:18:14.239
Caption: she will reply with hi your Twitter name

00:18:11.109 --> 00:18:20.719
Caption: meister tweet you or just you know one

00:18:14.239 --> 00:18:23.418
Caption: little sentence the keys for the Twitter

00:18:20.719 --> 00:18:30.020
Caption: bot are in the code those are not my

00:18:23.418 --> 00:18:31.519
Caption: keys there&#39;s some police that was one of

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.900
Caption: the things I found really confusing in

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.239
Caption: the beginning because people would put

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.460
Caption: you know insert your keys here and I was

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:40.280
Caption: like does that include the quote marks

00:18:37.459 --> 00:18:42.260
Caption: around it how do I know

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.500
Caption: does the keys look like this is this

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:47.510
Caption: what its effecting anyway they look like

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.849
Caption: that they look exactly like that but

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:54.469
Caption: different you know because that&#39;s not

00:18:49.849 --> 00:18:56.178
Caption: like those times at the top import TWiki

00:18:54.469 --> 00:18:59.959
Caption: and in poor time those are the two

00:18:56.178 --> 00:19:01.909
Caption: libraries that it uses so 3p kind that

00:18:59.959 --> 00:19:06.260
Caption: tells it how to do the stuff with

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:08.359
Caption: Twitter and time is literally for this

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:11.209
Caption: one little bit at the bottom where it

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:14.928
Caption: says hold off for 15 seconds because if

00:19:11.209 --> 00:19:17.079
Caption: your bot tweets rapidly Twitter will

00:19:14.928 --> 00:19:21.260
Caption: shut you

00:19:17.079 --> 00:19:23.029
Caption: so you have to make her pause so all

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.190
Caption: it&#39;s doing really atop its saying

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:28.190
Caption: there&#39;s the there&#39;s the keys he

00:19:25.189 --> 00:19:30.679
Caption: authenticated gainst Twitter it didn&#39;t

00:19:28.189 --> 00:19:32.449
Caption: used to do that so there&#39;s a lot of

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:35.270
Caption: tutorials that don&#39;t explain the

00:19:32.449 --> 00:19:36.739
Caption: authentication part and then of course

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:40.580
Caption: you can&#39;t get anything working if he

00:19:36.739 --> 00:19:46.429
Caption: don&#39;t have that in and then but last no

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:48.319
Caption: ID that is to stop it going crazy like

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.840
Caption: she often does when she&#39;s in the loud

00:19:48.319 --> 00:19:52.789
Caption: and just forgetting that she&#39;s already

00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:56.869
Caption: replied to your tweet and replying to

00:19:52.790 --> 00:20:00.920
Caption: your same tweet like 50 times more so it

00:19:56.869 --> 00:20:03.380
Caption: should take the ID of the last week that

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.869
Caption: it saw store that in a file and then

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:10.040
Caption: check that before sending a reply to a

00:20:05.869 --> 00:20:13.400
Caption: tweet and then in this there it is just

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:16.850
Caption: saying look for the hashtag when you see

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:20.020
Caption: so here it&#39;s hashtag Snickers respond

00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:24.619
Caption: back with hi at and then nice to tweet

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:28.580
Caption: so it&#39;s it really pretty simple if

00:20:24.619 --> 00:20:30.949
Caption: anyone is worried that about following

00:20:28.579 --> 00:20:33.079
Caption: the tutorials I do have they get help

00:20:30.949 --> 00:20:37.399
Caption: with the instructions on there so you

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:39.409
Caption: don&#39;t really need to make any notes okay

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.239
Caption: so then after I&#39;ve done that I thought I

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.910
Caption: will learn how to get it running through

00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:46.339
Caption: the cloud because otherwise it&#39;s just

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:48.530
Caption: running on your your desktop and when

00:20:46.339 --> 00:20:52.819
Caption: your desktop is down and you&#39;re good

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:54.920
Caption: about is down so I initially looked at

00:20:52.819 --> 00:21:00.049
Caption: Azure because I&#39;m working at Microsoft

00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:03.140
Caption: and you know use Azure there are a lot

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:05.060
Caption: of choices in there a lot of things you

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:07.849
Caption: can do there&#39;s a lot of traces and when

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:10.580
Caption: you are in your first 30 days of code

00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:15.229
Caption: you will be confused by all of the

00:21:10.579 --> 00:21:19.219
Caption: options you have so I found then who oq

00:21:15.229 --> 00:21:21.469
Caption: is the path system which will then all

00:21:19.219 --> 00:21:23.000
Caption: you need to do in Heroku is sort of

00:21:21.469 --> 00:21:24.558
Caption: click on the button that says create new

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.099
Caption: app and

00:21:24.558 --> 00:21:32.658
Caption: then attach or load your code into it

00:21:28.099 --> 00:21:35.359
Caption: and that&#39;s pretty much it so it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:21:32.659 --> 00:21:37.700
Caption: super super easy live with no traces oh

00:21:35.359 --> 00:21:44.359
Caption: yeah there are other clouds available of

00:21:37.699 --> 00:21:45.949
Caption: course however after I was more than 30

00:21:44.359 --> 00:21:49.749
Caption: days and I did go back

00:21:45.949 --> 00:21:52.758
Caption: Asya to see what else I could do and

00:21:49.749 --> 00:21:54.950
Caption: there&#39;s a yeah there&#39;s really a lot of a

00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:57.169
Caption: lot of fun things you can do in there

00:21:54.949 --> 00:22:00.498
Caption: that you can&#39;t do just on your own weave

00:21:57.168 --> 00:22:02.479
Caption: code and with a path system and here

00:22:00.499 --> 00:22:04.309
Caption: what I was looking at is connecting the

00:22:02.479 --> 00:22:07.099
Caption: different channels so yeah you can

00:22:04.308 --> 00:22:12.319
Caption: connect it to Facebook or to Skype or to

00:22:07.099 --> 00:22:14.869
Caption: teams or yeah Twilio or like a million

00:22:12.319 --> 00:22:19.428
Caption: other things and more of those will

00:22:14.869 --> 00:22:21.529
Caption: probably appear over time I only learn

00:22:19.428 --> 00:22:23.778
Caption: so you connect it to Facebook quite

00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:28.039
Caption: recently but I was very impressed with

00:22:23.779 --> 00:22:30.409
Caption: myself and I did what you can see down

00:22:28.038 --> 00:22:32.329
Caption: this side all of these resources were

00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:36.799
Caption: all the other things I was learning to

00:22:32.329 --> 00:22:38.808
Caption: do with the bots so I did some stuff

00:22:36.798 --> 00:22:41.349
Caption: we&#39;re sort of facial recognition and

00:22:38.808 --> 00:22:44.089
Caption: cognitive services back it could

00:22:41.349 --> 00:22:46.339
Caption: recognize my dogs and it could sort of

00:22:44.089 --> 00:22:50.689
Caption: recognize are they a shih tzu or are

00:22:46.339 --> 00:22:54.589
Caption: they not ETSU I&#39;ve had a very a dog

00:22:50.689 --> 00:22:55.998
Caption: still or not a dog I&#39;m specifically are

00:22:54.589 --> 00:22:59.388
Caption: they leo

00:22:55.999 --> 00:23:02.330
Caption: Snickers or shoo shoo or are they some

00:22:59.389 --> 00:23:04.789
Caption: other dog and I did put some of their

00:23:02.329 --> 00:23:06.709
Caption: friends and that kind of like Alsatians

00:23:04.788 --> 00:23:09.439
Caption: and kelpies that are completely

00:23:06.709 --> 00:23:12.229
Caption: different from small fluffy dogs and it

00:23:09.439 --> 00:23:14.298
Caption: could pick those out too so that was

00:23:12.229 --> 00:23:16.668
Caption: yeah that&#39;s pretty cool there&#39;s once

00:23:14.298 --> 00:23:18.739
Caption: you&#39;re confident with what you&#39;re doing

00:23:16.668 --> 00:23:24.558
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of fun stuff that you can

00:23:18.739 --> 00:23:28.339
Caption: plug into it if some of those are the

00:23:24.558 --> 00:23:30.398
Caption: lowest stuff as well so these bots that

00:23:28.339 --> 00:23:34.908
Caption: I&#39;m showing you today are all kind of

00:23:30.399 --> 00:23:39.809
Caption: dumbots but you can make a smart

00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:41.519
Caption: by using the language stuff oh I did

00:23:39.808 --> 00:23:43.890
Caption: have some really funny videos me just

00:23:41.519 --> 00:23:47.669
Caption: making faces at the camera where I was

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:50.190
Caption: using sentiment analysis so yeah there&#39;s

00:23:47.668 --> 00:23:53.869
Caption: really a lot of cool things you can do

00:23:50.189 --> 00:23:58.319
Caption: once she start learning about the bots

00:23:53.869 --> 00:24:02.489
Caption: so back to the snica bots this was kind

00:23:58.319 --> 00:24:07.009
Caption: of a better bot so she&#39;s a little bit

00:24:02.489 --> 00:24:09.599
Caption: better than the initial Cinco bot is

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:12.649
Caption: this one the first thing that I was

00:24:09.599 --> 00:24:17.819
Caption: super pleased with myself about was not

00:24:12.649 --> 00:24:20.309
Caption: having the keys in the code so the first

00:24:17.819 --> 00:24:22.018
Caption: step after having keys in the code is

00:24:20.308 --> 00:24:25.528
Caption: actually putting the keys in a different

00:24:22.019 --> 00:24:28.409
Caption: file and then having git ignore those

00:24:25.529 --> 00:24:32.010
Caption: keys so that it doesn&#39;t publish them on

00:24:28.409 --> 00:24:34.110
Caption: github and this is the next step after

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:37.889
Caption: that where you don&#39;t have the key in the

00:24:34.109 --> 00:24:40.048
Caption: code at all you tell it to look in the

00:24:37.889 --> 00:24:42.989
Caption: cloud system that you&#39;re running it

00:24:40.048 --> 00:24:46.918
Caption: through so you load them in as operating

00:24:42.989 --> 00:24:48.658
Caption: system environment variables and it&#39;s

00:24:46.918 --> 00:24:51.239
Caption: kind of like it&#39;s just a space in there

00:24:48.659 --> 00:24:54.720
Caption: where you fill those in and then there

00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:56.849
Caption: that tells it to look for there but that

00:24:54.719 --> 00:24:59.459
Caption: means that you need more lines at the

00:24:56.849 --> 00:25:01.589
Caption: top so where it says import to be in

00:24:59.459 --> 00:25:04.678
Caption: port time that we had before you also

00:25:01.589 --> 00:25:07.859
Caption: need import OS and the OS is the thing

00:25:04.678 --> 00:25:11.849
Caption: that&#39;s going to know about those

00:25:07.859 --> 00:25:15.678
Caption: operating system variables and then I

00:25:11.849 --> 00:25:18.750
Caption: have import random because I&#39;m gonna

00:25:15.678 --> 00:25:21.928
Caption: have it if you random access to your

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:26.279
Caption: tweets so from a file called messages

00:25:21.928 --> 00:25:28.439
Caption: that I have created separately so then

00:25:26.279 --> 00:25:31.440
Caption: it does pretty much the same thing as it

00:25:28.439 --> 00:25:34.829
Caption: did before but depending on what hashtag

00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:40.319
Caption: you use it does a different thing so if

00:25:34.829 --> 00:25:43.169
Caption: you do if you do DDD perf it will give

00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:45.849
Caption: you answer from one vial and if you do

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:48.700
Caption: rising robots it will give you an answer

00:25:45.849 --> 00:25:50.559
Caption: from another file and it will if you do

00:25:48.699 --> 00:25:53.380
Caption: Snickers I don&#39;t kill all just do the

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:56.370
Caption: same one-liner that it was doing

00:25:53.380 --> 00:26:00.449
Caption: previously if it&#39;s kind of using if

00:25:56.369 --> 00:26:03.459
Caption: statements and early statements and just

00:26:00.449 --> 00:26:05.439
Caption: before I figured out that if I put some

00:26:03.459 --> 00:26:08.649
Caption: breaks in there then it wouldn&#39;t go

00:26:05.439 --> 00:26:14.049
Caption: crazy when when it found unexpected

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:17.050
Caption: stuff that is pretty happy with that so

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:19.660
Caption: then this is this the next one I found

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:22.480
Caption: really useful this one is a blog on the

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:25.090
Caption: Twilio website and from there I used how

00:26:22.479 --> 00:26:33.069
Caption: to make the bots into a Facebook but

00:26:25.089 --> 00:26:37.289
Caption: instead of a Twitter BOTS so it&#39;s not I

00:26:33.069 --> 00:26:41.649
Caption: can&#39;t figure out how to make Facebook

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:46.710
Caption: make the bots public they just keep

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:53.460
Caption: rejecting I bought but it doesn&#39;t for me

00:26:46.709 --> 00:27:08.279
Caption: so I&#39;m typing in blue and it&#39;s sending

00:26:53.459 --> 00:27:10.989
Caption: responses there this one it eases yeah I

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:19.119
Caption: should have had my glasses on I can&#39;t

00:27:10.989 --> 00:27:21.130
Caption: see what what I used there oh yeah

00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:24.160
Caption: that&#39;s using flask so this is using

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:27.810
Caption: flask which is a slightly different web

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:30.989
Caption: front-end the night breeze least and

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:36.340
Caption: yeah all that stuff in the middle is

00:27:30.989 --> 00:27:40.559
Caption: related to the Facebook thing and it is

00:27:36.339 --> 00:27:46.479
Caption: getting these so it also has similar a

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:48.970
Caption: similar kind of messages file that it

00:27:46.479 --> 00:27:51.640
Caption: takes this off on but the one that he

00:27:48.969 --> 00:27:53.079
Caption: had written in the tutorial he said

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.479
Caption: would just be a

00:27:53.079 --> 00:27:59.299
Caption: like a like a nice but the goal was for

00:27:56.479 --> 00:28:01.309
Caption: it to just weed out nice things from it

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:05.720
Caption: and that was what I used for my template

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:09.170
Caption: for this one then I thought I would like

00:28:05.719 --> 00:28:13.130
Caption: to be a little bit spotter so I tried

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:17.330
Caption: this as your tutorial this one only

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:20.329
Caption: takes 45 minutes 48 minutes to do and it

00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:23.569
Caption: uses Q&amp;A maker so what I liked about

00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:25.909
Caption: this is that you could load up a whole

00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:27.380
Caption: bunch of information like from wiki or

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.150
Caption: something like that

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:32.060
Caption: so if you were running a helpdesk you

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:34.700
Caption: could when they&#39;re like you could run

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:38.930
Caption: your know your have the scripts through

00:28:34.699 --> 00:28:41.569
Caption: it but it would also learn so from the

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:43.240
Caption: fact that you are having questions and

00:28:41.569 --> 00:28:47.809
Caption: answers with it it will then from those

00:28:43.239 --> 00:28:52.250
Caption: so and can train it within their the Q&amp;A

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:54.770
Caption: maker thing after that you could then go

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:56.359
Caption: in and incorporate some Louis stuff in

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:58.400
Caption: it as well so it could look at your

00:28:56.359 --> 00:29:01.309
Caption: intense and it could try and form

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:07.550
Caption: answers based on what it thought we&#39;re

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:12.650
Caption: trying to ask so this is so built in

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:15.050
Caption: Asia and that&#39;s the web test there but

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:17.900
Caption: then in order different and I learn it

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:21.950
Caption: again through the same facebook

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:24.170
Caption: messenger thing and so this one it asks

00:29:21.949 --> 00:29:25.819
Caption: it knows about bots and you can ask it

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:29.600
Caption: questions about bots and will answer

00:29:25.819 --> 00:29:30.409
Caption: questions about bots but if you ask you

00:29:29.599 --> 00:29:33.169
Caption: something else

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:36.260
Caption: that is not about what it will still

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:39.220
Caption: answer and there were things in there

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:41.690
Caption: that I didn&#39;t put in there that it

00:29:39.219 --> 00:29:43.579
Caption: answered but I only really notice them

00:29:41.689 --> 00:29:46.029
Caption: other people were playing with it

00:29:43.579 --> 00:29:49.099
Caption: because obviously in my head I knew once

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:50.840
Caption: questions to ask it and then I asked my

00:29:49.099 --> 00:29:54.289
Caption: husband have a look and he said what is

00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:56.059
Caption: your name oh god I never thought anyone

00:29:54.290 --> 00:30:00.200
Caption: would ask it what his name is when I

00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:02.980
Caption: said a skit about BOTS but it said what

00:30:00.199 --> 00:30:02.979
Caption: is in a name

00:30:03.749 --> 00:30:11.279
Caption: and I felt that&#39;s very philosophical it

00:30:08.798 --> 00:30:15.099
Caption: had to see surprising answers like that

00:30:11.279 --> 00:30:24.100
Caption: so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a fun thing to do

00:30:15.099 --> 00:30:26.619
Caption: play with so Waveland this is the from

00:30:24.099 --> 00:30:28.388
Caption: the tutorial on the trio website and it

00:30:26.619 --> 00:30:31.299
Caption: said if you want to create a

00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:33.700
Caption: requirements document requirements mile

00:30:31.298 --> 00:30:36.758
Caption: you can just type pip three freeze

00:30:33.699 --> 00:30:37.928
Caption: greater than requirements text and you

00:30:36.759 --> 00:30:41.229
Caption: will have a file that looks like this

00:30:37.928 --> 00:30:47.709
Caption: and then my file look like that

00:30:41.229 --> 00:30:48.759
Caption: I might&#39;ve but it turned out that&#39;s

00:30:47.709 --> 00:30:50.558
Caption: totally fine

00:30:48.759 --> 00:30:52.989
Caption: it&#39;s the reason it&#39;s like that is

00:30:50.558 --> 00:30:56.859
Caption: because I have you know installed

00:30:52.989 --> 00:30:58.629
Caption: everything in world because I didn&#39;t

00:30:56.859 --> 00:31:00.928
Caption: know what I might meet and I might not

00:30:58.629 --> 00:31:03.509
Caption: meet and all of these things look good

00:31:00.928 --> 00:31:07.148
Caption: so yeah there&#39;s more than I need there

00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:10.989
Caption: you can cut them out as well so if you

00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:13.539
Caption: know that your your code is only using

00:31:10.989 --> 00:31:16.690
Caption: flask and it&#39;s not using Django as well

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:18.939
Caption: which obviously it wouldn&#39;t be you can

00:31:16.689 --> 00:31:22.868
Caption: take out all of the stuff and just put

00:31:18.939 --> 00:31:24.579
Caption: things in its definitely needing the

00:31:22.869 --> 00:31:26.859
Caption: advantage of having those in the

00:31:24.579 --> 00:31:28.898
Caption: requirements file is that when you try

00:31:26.859 --> 00:31:31.119
Caption: to write in the cloud it will learn

00:31:28.899 --> 00:31:36.580
Caption: correctly on white versions and it won&#39;t

00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:38.859
Caption: you know era that there&#39;s a lot of free

00:31:36.579 --> 00:31:41.229
Caption: tutorials out there that was one of the

00:31:38.859 --> 00:31:43.509
Caption: things I don&#39;t go did you know I bought

00:31:41.229 --> 00:31:46.119
Caption: some they brought front and web masses

00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:50.619
Caption: which was really good and I bought the

00:31:46.119 --> 00:31:52.179
Caption: code combat thing but also a lot of

00:31:50.619 --> 00:31:53.919
Caption: things that I follow for free were

00:31:52.178 --> 00:31:57.099
Caption: really really good as well I do

00:31:53.918 --> 00:32:00.099
Caption: recommend that will year one because not

00:31:57.099 --> 00:32:02.979
Caption: just the great logs but the learn how to

00:32:00.099 --> 00:32:05.408
Caption: use it by playing a game thing really

00:32:02.979 --> 00:32:06.489
Caption: appeals to me as a gamers in the

00:32:05.409 --> 00:32:11.380
Caption: audience

00:32:06.489 --> 00:32:15.428
Caption: a few yeah it&#39;s super fun they&#39;ve just

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:17.500
Caption: released a like a full game version on

00:32:15.428 --> 00:32:24.308
Caption: early access which I&#39;m completely

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:27.280
Caption: addicted to already ah also learn that

00:32:24.308 --> 00:32:29.558
Caption: if you don&#39;t know what to do you can

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:31.390
Caption: just ask you can ask the community you

00:32:29.558 --> 00:32:33.729
Caption: can tweet it out and people will tweet

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:37.178
Caption: back at you and tell you what the answer

00:32:33.729 --> 00:32:40.209
Caption: is Phil gave me a lot of answers and

00:32:37.178 --> 00:32:43.239
Caption: didn&#39;t make me feel stupid at all and

00:32:40.209 --> 00:32:44.979
Caption: not just feel like a lot of people when

00:32:43.239 --> 00:32:46.510
Caption: when something goes wrong and you just

00:32:44.979 --> 00:32:51.040
Caption: can&#39;t figure it out and you&#39;re about to

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:52.690

Caption: says that was a stupid question or if

Caption: the wrong place don&#39;t follow those

00:33:01.569 --> 00:33:11.558
Caption: people anymore look away from them this

00:33:06.339 --> 00:33:14.260
Caption: is morbid advice from Nina in that you

00:33:11.558 --> 00:33:16.359
Caption: don&#39;t feel it it was at the start of

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:18.880
Caption: your hundred days of code you really

00:33:16.359 --> 00:33:20.890
Caption: feel like you don&#39;t know anything but I

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.839
Caption: should go on you start to feel like you

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:24.640
Caption: really know and the stuff that was so

00:33:22.839 --> 00:33:28.209
Caption: hard at the beginning becomes really

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.790
Caption: obvious but it is practice it isn&#39;t an

00:33:28.209 --> 00:33:37.619
Caption: innate talent that was born in in the

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:41.710
Caption: developer guts it&#39;s lil again helping me

00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:43.719
Caption: sometimes it really isn&#39;t anything so a

00:33:41.709 --> 00:33:46.599
Caption: lot of the times it was a stupid syntax

00:33:43.719 --> 00:33:48.250
Caption: error in your code but sometimes you do

00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:49.449
Caption: just turn it off and on again and

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:53.229
Caption: suddenly it works

00:33:49.449 --> 00:33:58.029
Caption: and feels that that happens to him all

00:33:53.229 --> 00:34:02.530
Caption: the time too so here is where I have

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:05.559
Caption: documented the tutorial so it is a

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:10.148
Caption: github repository called rise of the

00:34:05.558 --> 00:34:12.699
Caption: robots and in there&#39;s a code directory

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:16.598
Caption: in that way you can get code and there

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:23.558
Caption: is also a Doc&#39;s directory where I have

00:34:16.599 --> 00:34:26.319
Caption: this first document it&#39;s not yeah it&#39;s

00:34:23.559 --> 00:34:29.109
Caption: not yet perfect in that I see that I

00:34:26.319 --> 00:34:31.539
Caption: just said you know go to the go with the

00:34:29.108 --> 00:34:35.738
Caption: Twitter app developer paid and just fill

00:34:31.539 --> 00:34:37.839
Caption: that stuff in that isn&#39;t enough if it&#39;s

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:39.428
Caption: your first time to Twitter app developer

00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:40.839
Caption: page because you&#39;re looking all the

00:34:39.428 --> 00:34:43.148
Caption: things to fill in and you&#39;re thinking

00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:46.269
Caption: what do I bring there so I will put a

00:34:43.148 --> 00:34:48.788
Caption: screenshot of what that looks like so

00:34:46.269 --> 00:34:50.918
Caption: that people can see it it&#39;s just that

00:34:48.789 --> 00:34:58.839
Caption: when you try to make the documentation

00:34:50.918 --> 00:35:01.209
Caption: it&#39;s super boring from the good

00:34:58.839 --> 00:35:04.749
Caption: documentation I followed I realized that

00:35:01.209 --> 00:35:07.059
Caption: the most explicit documentation is the

00:35:04.749 --> 00:35:08.739
Caption: best documentation and so the best thing

00:35:07.059 --> 00:35:11.049
Caption: that I can do for those that come after

00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:13.749
Caption: me it&#39;s like really explicit

00:35:11.049 --> 00:35:16.390
Caption: documentation I will improve it

00:35:13.749 --> 00:35:20.079
Caption: however it would also like to help me do

00:35:16.389 --> 00:35:27.209
Caption: that do you feel free to you know

00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:30.609
Caption: that we pay and make up all requests

00:35:27.209 --> 00:35:33.429
Caption: yeah now add more in there as I carry on

00:35:30.608 --> 00:35:35.078
Caption: because I will not stop at the hundred

00:35:33.429 --> 00:35:38.649
Caption: days I think there&#39;s still so much more

00:35:35.079 --> 00:35:42.249
Caption: to learn and so many so many things I

00:35:38.649 --> 00:35:45.038
Caption: was distracted by a long way so yeah I

00:35:42.249 --> 00:35:48.489
Caption: don&#39;t have up a robot on me I only have

00:35:45.039 --> 00:35:50.680
Caption: to be robots currently of maybe four and

00:35:48.489 --> 00:35:53.139
Caption: it&#39;s not enough to take over the world

00:35:50.679 --> 00:35:57.098
Caption: so I don&#39;t have to keep going beyond the

00:35:53.139 --> 00:35:59.409
Caption: hundred days those your eyes wait close

00:35:57.099 --> 00:36:06.759
Caption: your eyes close your eyes close your

00:35:59.409 --> 00:36:09.669
Caption: eyes and I&#39;ll just read you the poem so

00:36:06.759 --> 00:36:13.390
Caption: beautiful is better than ugly explicit

00:36:09.669 --> 00:36:16.389
Caption: is better than implicit symbol is better

00:36:13.389 --> 00:36:19.959
Caption: than complex complex is better than

00:36:16.389 --> 00:36:22.959
Caption: complicated what is better than nested

00:36:19.959 --> 00:36:26.439
Caption: sparse is better than dense readability

00:36:22.959 --> 00:36:28.449
Caption: counts special cases aren&#39;t special

00:36:26.439 --> 00:36:32.199
Caption: enough to break the rules

00:36:28.449 --> 00:36:34.510
Caption: although practicality beats purity Alice

00:36:32.199 --> 00:36:37.570
Caption: should never have silently unless

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:40.389
Caption: explicitly silenced in the face of

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:43.150
Caption: ambiguity refuse the temptation gasps

00:36:40.389 --> 00:36:46.089
Caption: there should be one and probably only

00:36:43.149 --> 00:36:48.459
Caption: one obvious way to do it or there that

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:51.790
Caption: way may not be obvious at first

00:36:48.459 --> 00:36:52.330
Caption: unless you&#39;re Dutch now is better than

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:54.219
Caption: ever

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:55.390
Caption: although never is often better than

00:36:54.219 --> 00:36:58.209
Caption: right now

00:36:55.389 --> 00:37:01.209
Caption: if implementation is hard to explain

00:36:58.209 --> 00:37:04.589
Caption: it&#39;s a bad idea if the implementation is

00:37:01.209 --> 00:37:07.689
Caption: easy to explain it may be a good idea

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:11.920
Caption: namespaces are one honking great idea

00:37:07.689 --> 00:37:15.219
Caption: let&#39;s do more of those so it can open

00:37:11.919 --> 00:37:18.609
Caption: eyes is one of the other eat Easter eggs

00:37:15.219 --> 00:37:21.849
Caption: from Python so when you type import this

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:27.780
Caption: it brings up this poem which is known as

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:30.489
Caption: the Zen of Python and it is a relief

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:33.790
Caption: when you code like this you code

00:37:30.489 --> 00:37:37.600
Caption: pythonic Lee is is what they say so I

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:40.120
Caption: really like it because it&#39;s though all

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:43.720
Caption: these beautiful little tricks but if you

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:45.850
Caption: type it again import this it won&#39;t bring

00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:51.790
Caption: it up a second line it&#39;ll bring it up

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:53.940
Caption: only the first time okay and then we&#39;re

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:53.939
Caption: done

00:37:59.889 --> 00:38:01.949
Caption: you
