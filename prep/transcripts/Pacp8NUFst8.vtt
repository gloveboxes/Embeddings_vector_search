Caption: straight in so I want to talk to you

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:38.520
Caption: today about feature trees and that&#39;s

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:41.040
Caption: what this entire talk is about before we

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.319
Caption: do um if we just mentioned this is my

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.379

Caption: amazing so thanks for learning with me

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:00.898
Caption: I&#39;m learning about this topic as well so

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.340
Caption: yeah just again I&#39;m going to say this a

00:01:00.898 --> 00:01:03.479
Caption: few times thank you for allowing me to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.239
Caption: share today

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.400
Caption: so I have a bone to pick with you

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:10.199
Caption: you did this you voted for this talk so

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.639
Caption: you know like why are we here that kind

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:14.639
Caption: of thing so this is in place of the

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:16.260
Caption: agenda slide so what&#39;s all this thing so

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:19.080
Caption: today I want to take you through first

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.000
Caption: of all what is a feature tree why I use

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.459
Caption: it in my workflow when I&#39;m designing and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.259
Caption: building products and why sort of a

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.059
Caption: central artifact for teams to Rally

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.400
Caption: around and then also I&#39;m going to share

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:31.618
Caption: some tips and tricks from how you create

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.659
Caption: them and you&#39;ll also hear today a few

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.579
Caption: cornellisms I don&#39;t write scripts for my

00:01:33.658 --> 00:01:37.379
Caption: talks it&#39;s just incompatible with my

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.840
Caption: nerves so I&#39;m just gonna wig it but

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:43.319
Caption: within reason of course so let&#39;s um Jump

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:45.959
Caption: Right In for me the gold standard of a

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.059
Caption: featured tree is that of up so up is a

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.079
Caption: digital bank quick show of hands anyone

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:50.519
Caption: with up

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.380
Caption: yeah they&#39;re pretty cool I probably

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:54.658
Caption: should change to them so let&#39;s imagine

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:56.339
Caption: up that app in your pocket that is the

00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:58.860
Caption: product I&#39;m going to use a lot of sort

00:01:56.339 --> 00:02:00.419
Caption: of agile product service design kind of

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.860
Caption: language here today so if you hear some

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:03.779
Caption: of that language that&#39;s where that comes

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.939
Caption: from but up that is the product the

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:07.739
Caption: product is the tree the thing that your

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.360
Caption: users see so that&#39;s the end goal

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:12.059
Caption: visualizing the product

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.098
Caption: next up we&#39;ve got a set of features

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:16.199
Caption: that&#39;s the functionality everything

00:02:14.098 --> 00:02:19.199
Caption: that&#39;s built that the user can interact

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:20.878
Caption: with what&#39;s built they sum to the tree

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:23.580
Caption: so that&#39;s where the Roots come from the

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:26.458
Caption: tree pretty simple concept and then we

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.500
Caption: go into the detail of a specific feature

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:30.479
Caption: so here we&#39;ve got for example the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.160
Caption: feature of a payment and on the bottom

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.019
Caption: right you&#39;ll see a key so you&#39;ve got

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.819
Caption: stuff like what&#39;s being built or what&#39;s

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.220
Caption: in progress what have we already done

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.779
Caption: what&#39;s coming up or what have we pruned

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.660
Caption: what are we not building sometimes it&#39;s

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:44.899
Caption: nice to visualize that so for example in

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.098
Caption: this very specific example we&#39;ve got

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.419
Caption: making a payment of course it&#39;s a

00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:50.639
Caption: payment app you want to be able to make

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:52.500
Caption: a payment what&#39;s next oh you might want

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.059
Caption: to schedule the payment and then what&#39;s

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.919
Caption: next you might want to do multiple of

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:58.080
Caption: those and you want them to recur so

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.940
Caption: that&#39;s just a way for users and whoever

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.619
Caption: interacts with this feature tree to go

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.238
Caption: that&#39;s a pretty simple way of me

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:05.339
Caption: understanding what are all the things I

00:03:03.238 --> 00:03:07.259
Caption: can do in this product and you stagger

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:09.238
Caption: those features and you&#39;ll see some of

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:11.639
Caption: them connect they can get pretty curly

00:03:09.238 --> 00:03:13.979
Caption: pretty quickly but it&#39;s it&#39;s intended to

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.679
Caption: be a simple communication artifact

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:20.279
Caption: so if we Zoom all the way out you&#39;ll see

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:23.039
Caption: this long complicated map of features if

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:26.339
Caption: you will so divided by columns sometimes

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:28.199
Caption: even by priority or by rows the order in

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.699
Caption: which it&#39;s been delivered but it may

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.378
Caption: look like a really sophisticated

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.779
Caption: complicated map

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:35.819
Caption: and you might think this is a bank it&#39;s

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:38.339
Caption: a public facing product why are they

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.720
Caption: making this sort of that transparent I

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:41.699
Caption: think it&#39;s pretty cool for products to

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.680
Caption: be so radically out there and say these

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.360
Caption: are the things I&#39;ve done so the firstly

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.798
Caption: allows people to navigate that map and

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.319
Caption: see these are all the cool things I can

00:03:46.798 --> 00:03:51.298
Caption: do for example you want the API to hook

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.098
Caption: in to get all your payment data you want

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:55.080
Caption: to do some fancy graphs with it you can

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:56.699
Caption: do that because it&#39;s lower down on the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.378
Caption: feature tree and you can see that that&#39;s

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:00.899
Caption: only for some obsessive people not like

00:03:58.378 --> 00:04:02.158
Caption: me but it can also see what&#39;s up next

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:05.399
Caption: for example

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:07.319
Caption: so having that accountability publishing

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:10.018
Caption: this online this is a fully interactive

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.399
Caption: website super high fidelity I&#39;m not here

00:04:10.018 --> 00:04:12.779
Caption: today to tell you this is what we&#39;re

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:15.238
Caption: aspiring to when we&#39;re doing feature

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:17.760
Caption: trees but it exposes a concept to me at

00:04:15.238 --> 00:04:19.859
Caption: least pretty beautifully so if you&#39;re

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.260
Caption: thinking this is super complicated it&#39;s

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.899
Caption: very messy it&#39;s a lot of detailed it&#39;s

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.320
Caption: actually in my estimation just supposed

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:31.139
Caption: to be a really well organized list so I

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.479
Caption: want to play a quick game by a show of

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.240
Caption: hands a common list we all use which is

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.699
Caption: our shopping lists right so

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:41.160
Caption: it&#39;s a game so put your hand up for me

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.500
Caption: if you before you go grocery shopping if

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.019
Caption: you even make a list

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.459
Caption: okay good you all then just go rock up

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:48.720
Caption: then opportunistic please keep your

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:51.479
Caption: hands up for me

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.119
Caption: so now keep your hand up for me if you

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.100
Caption: organize that list somehow

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:58.440
Caption: a few hands might drop okay we got some

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.300
Caption: people they love it okay now next

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.419
Caption: question keep your hand up again for me

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:07.440
Caption: if you organize that list by the floor

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.720
Caption: plan of your favorite grocery store

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.399
Caption: okay here we go okay so you&#39;re kind of

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.019
Caption: using your shopping list as a bit of a

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:15.059
Caption: map right so that helps you navigate

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:17.279
Caption: your grocery store final question for

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:20.399
Caption: now then I can let you put your arms

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:21.839
Caption: down so keep your hands up again and one

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:23.039
Caption: or two people might actually put their

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.559
Caption: hands up again

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.660
Caption: keep your hands up if you organize your

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:29.100
Caption: shopping list deliberately the keyword

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.880
Caption: is deliberately so that it can be used

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.380
Caption: in any grocery store

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.360
Caption: purple is hiring so come chat to us

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.800
Caption: afterwards that&#39;ll be great no so the

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:39.599
Caption: only concept I wanted to explore there

00:05:37.799 --> 00:05:42.299
Caption: is you might then be using your shopping

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.800
Caption: list as a compass something that allows

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:45.478
Caption: you to navigate or respond to the

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:47.039
Caption: environment you&#39;re in so we&#39;re going to

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.800
Caption: live a little bit in metaphor territory

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.479
Caption: what is a feature tree is it a map is it

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:54.299
Caption: a compass I&#39;m here to tell you why not

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:57.300
Caption: both so typically when we see a feature

00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:59.819
Caption: tree a list a very simple well-organized

00:05:57.299 --> 00:06:02.519
Caption: list I see one of those old school maps

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.679
Caption: that you fold out it&#39;s a static fixed

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:06.720
Caption: environment you think at least at that

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:08.880
Caption: point in time you know your environment

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.519
Caption: that is just your articulation I guess

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.500
Caption: of what we know now and what we&#39;ve built

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:16.079
Caption: what we&#39;re currently building and what&#39;s

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.179
Caption: up next sometimes even just arriving at

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:19.258
Caption: that is sort of the destination that

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:22.380
Caption: process

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.299
Caption: but is it a compass how does a featured

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.660
Caption: tree act as a compass to help us

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:29.879
Caption: navigate the the colorful you know Seas

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.779
Caption: or world that is navigating this product

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.179
Caption: space

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:35.699
Caption: and that is if you&#39;ve got that Baseline

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:38.039
Caption: that document that setup that allows you

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.380
Caption: to say right this is my product these

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:42.600
Caption: are the features these are all the the

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.119
Caption: functionality that exist if for example

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.100
Caption: introducing new functionality you&#39;ve got

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:49.380
Caption: that visual artifact that allows you to

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.300
Caption: negotiate a little bit if I have this I

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.759
Caption: won&#39;t be getting this or that fits in

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:55.198
Caption: here or these things relate especially

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.600
Caption: when there&#39;s multiple teams

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:00.059
Caption: communicating around for example a

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.580
Caption: product backlog and that you have that

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:04.199
Caption: summary piece that accompanies it so it

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:06.239
Caption: might sound a little bit like apologetic

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:08.580
Caption: this is not to like the most crazy outer

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:10.799
Caption: topic ever but it&#39;s such a nice way of

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:13.079
Caption: just surfacing coming up for air from a

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:15.659
Caption: product backlog so I mentioned product

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:17.939
Caption: backlog let&#39;s look at one so this is a

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.699
Caption: common backlog what you don&#39;t have to do

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.679
Caption: today is critique the user stories here

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:25.739
Caption: you can I didn&#39;t write them so I&#39;ll join

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:27.779
Caption: you so um this is just an example of

00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:29.699
Caption: user stories in a backlog that

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:32.160
Caption: developers would commonly use to build

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:34.020
Caption: certain functionality on the right this

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.880
Caption: is the product called jira I like the

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:37.918
Caption: example here because it at least

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.380
Caption: visually color codes all that green

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:42.360
Caption: stories on the right I think they relate

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.940
Caption: to one another and they form a feature

00:07:42.359 --> 00:07:47.159
Caption: set you can&#39;t scroll here but I can so

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.779
Caption: for example when I scrolled down you can

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.339
Caption: see okay there&#39;s multiple stories here

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:52.079
Caption: so we&#39;re working on a piece of

00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:54.539
Caption: functionality for that feature here here

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:57.359
Caption: so it does go into that space but

00:07:54.539 --> 00:08:00.299
Caption: sometimes it&#39;s not as visual so this is

00:07:57.359 --> 00:08:02.698
Caption: another deliberately sort of small

00:08:00.299 --> 00:08:05.339
Caption: um a screenshot here let&#39;s just for

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:07.559
Caption: example say that first one to seven

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:09.660
Caption: stories here if you understand this

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:12.598
Caption: product it&#39;s all in the realm of like I

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.459
Caption: get it it&#39;s maybe a value on a page and

00:08:12.598 --> 00:08:16.399
Caption: when was it last updated things like

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:19.079
Caption: that so this back to the shopping

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:21.179
Caption: experience is for example I&#39;m in the

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:22.799
Caption: Woolworths in Palmyra I&#39;m there I&#39;ll

00:08:21.179 --> 00:08:24.959
Caption: just grab a basket I know I need bread

00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:27.119
Caption: and eggs I think I know what needs to

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:29.220
Caption: happen Story one two seven all of a

00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:31.199
Caption: sudden shout out to my partner Jeff she

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.119
Caption: calls me I&#39;ve got a basket by the the

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:36.119
Caption: way can you buy eight watermelons for me

00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:38.398
Caption: and I&#39;m like I don&#39;t have hashtag scope

00:08:36.119 --> 00:08:40.799
Caption: for eight watermelons in my basket it&#39;s

00:08:38.398 --> 00:08:43.080
Caption: gonna smash the bread I&#39;m wearing a mask

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:45.778
Caption: I&#39;m gonna sneeze straight up a bad time

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:49.559
Caption: no one likes that kind of a surprise

00:08:45.778 --> 00:08:51.898
Caption: if we had a feature tree you could say

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:54.179
Caption: for example that is a really high effort

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:56.518
Caption: or high value feature visualized that

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:58.619
Caption: way you&#39;re gonna run through a quick you

00:08:56.518 --> 00:09:00.359
Caption: know quick fire of stories over here but

00:08:58.619 --> 00:09:02.219
Caption: there is that big thing coming our way

00:09:00.359 --> 00:09:04.440
Caption: that story in this example was just

00:09:02.219 --> 00:09:07.619
Caption: casually create an iOS version of the

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:10.080
Caption: app and we were like okay cool cool cool

00:09:07.619 --> 00:09:11.880
Caption: um so here&#39;s another example I say does

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.760
Caption: it hurt yet I&#39;m humoring designers

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.859
Caption: sometimes we&#39;re asked to just hand over

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.080
Caption: a um

00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:20.278
Caption: all of the research we&#39;ve done so just

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.739
Caption: quickly give me all the business

00:09:20.278 --> 00:09:25.619
Caption: requirements and we&#39;ll build it detail

00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:28.619
Caption: has a home I absolutely love detail but

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:30.479
Caption: this is not that if you pull me into a

00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:32.640
Caption: meeting with no notice what have you

00:09:30.479 --> 00:09:34.799
Caption: done where are we at what are we

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.920
Caption: building this does not give you that so

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:40.278
Caption: all I&#39;m saying is this has a place

00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:43.018
Caption: especially when it comes to the Tactical

00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:45.659
Caption: strategic or Vision or system level

00:09:43.018 --> 00:09:47.820
Caption: transformation that detail for me lives

00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:50.159
Caption: all the way in the Tactical don&#39;t you

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.898
Caption: dare this over discover things that are

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:54.059
Caption: three four five years away because it&#39;s

00:09:51.898 --> 00:09:56.820
Caption: gonna go stale so what a feature tree

00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:59.398
Caption: does really well for me is

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:02.580
Caption: um support this the detail that we&#39;ve

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:05.518
Caption: discovered and then it visualizes that

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:07.860
Caption: neatly where it fits in and it supports

00:10:05.518 --> 00:10:09.958
Caption: the delivery of the backlog so it

00:10:07.859 --> 00:10:12.119
Caption: represents the work it&#39;s the sum of

00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:14.880
Caption: what&#39;s in the backlog in a more visual

00:10:12.119 --> 00:10:17.398
Caption: way so that&#39;s kind of the theory bit

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.898
Caption: over I guess so introducing you to what

00:10:17.398 --> 00:10:21.479
Caption: it is let&#39;s go into why I think it&#39;s

00:10:18.898 --> 00:10:23.039
Caption: awesome it&#39;s good for me to give a get a

00:10:21.479 --> 00:10:25.380
Caption: layer of the land like who is here in

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:27.359
Caption: the room so I might ask you or online

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.220
Caption: with my mom in South Africa is watching

00:10:27.359 --> 00:10:32.700
Caption: hello Melinda

00:10:29.219 --> 00:10:34.559
Caption: um so we&#39;ve got four groups here crudely

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.940
Caption: summarized right crudely summarized if

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:37.919
Caption: you&#39;re not in one of these groups pick

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.979
Caption: one but I just want a quick show of

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:43.018
Caption: hands so designers

00:10:40.979 --> 00:10:45.838
Caption: um my fan club over there thank you

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:48.000
Caption: awesome okay so Developers

00:10:45.838 --> 00:10:50.398
Caption: that could be data there&#39;s really well

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.200
Caption: represented awesome and product owners

00:10:50.398 --> 00:10:54.479
Caption: or product people anyone in that space

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.179
Caption: awesome and then projects stakeholders

00:10:54.479 --> 00:10:59.639
Caption: whatever that means awesome colorful

00:10:57.179 --> 00:11:02.039
Caption: okay so I&#39;ll try and skew towards the

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.320
Caption: dev side of things if my you know

00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:06.179
Caption: abilities allow so I want to take you

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.278
Caption: through my experience of exposing or

00:11:06.179 --> 00:11:09.479
Caption: introducing this as an artifact to these

00:11:08.278 --> 00:11:11.338
Caption: four groups

00:11:09.479 --> 00:11:13.199
Caption: what changes I brought about or what

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:14.760
Caption: kinds of problems does it solve I&#39;ll

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.260
Caption: also on the right of each of these

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.720
Caption: slides to show you some of the examples

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.640
Caption: that I&#39;ve worked on I may have had a

00:11:18.719 --> 00:11:22.439
Caption: direct hand in some of them or my team

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.700
Caption: the fan club over there may have created

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.739
Caption: some of it so if you&#39;ve got any

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.958
Caption: questions yeah if you love them let me

00:11:25.739 --> 00:11:29.940
Caption: know if you don&#39;t

00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:31.619
Caption: so let&#39;s jump into why designers love it

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.059
Caption: you can all read the bullets as well so

00:11:31.619 --> 00:11:35.278
Caption: I&#39;ll do some storytelling around the

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:38.099
Caption: bullets but the first thing we do is

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:39.898
Caption: often when we are introduced I work in a

00:11:38.099 --> 00:11:41.819
Caption: Consulting capacity so

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:43.919
Caption: when we&#39;re introduced to a new problem

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.660
Caption: you might go through some rapid research

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:47.700
Caption: or my favorite is the research has been

00:11:45.659 --> 00:11:49.379
Caption: done can you just make it look pretty so

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.940
Caption: we might end up for example with a

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.338
Caption: pretty prototype it&#39;s clickable it&#39;s

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.119
Caption: real it feels good the designer smashed

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:56.219
Caption: it

00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:58.320
Caption: but there&#39;s so much more value about

00:11:56.219 --> 00:12:00.599
Caption: going through that process sincerely and

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.700
Caption: in depth you gain a lot of context so

00:12:00.599 --> 00:12:05.159
Caption: the first bullet there is it allows us

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:07.500
Caption: to share the context far beyond just the

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:09.898
Caption: pretty pictures because the second we

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.700
Caption: ask some of the questions is that system

00:12:09.898 --> 00:12:13.739
Caption: ready to give us the data we think we

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.838
Caption: need for that feature day one no it&#39;s

00:12:13.739 --> 00:12:18.898
Caption: not okay is it still a valuable problem

00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:21.359
Caption: to solve yes okay well we might untangle

00:12:18.898 --> 00:12:23.099
Caption: the Prototype ever so slightly and that

00:12:21.359 --> 00:12:25.018
Caption: might be represented by the order in

00:12:23.099 --> 00:12:27.000
Caption: which we organize our thought so again

00:12:25.018 --> 00:12:29.219
Caption: pretty simple content but it is nice for

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.078
Caption: us to at least then go if I just want to

00:12:29.219 --> 00:12:33.179
Caption: do the right thing for the users and for

00:12:31.078 --> 00:12:34.919
Caption: the products owners and stackers that

00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:36.359
Caption: kind of thing you want to be able to at

00:12:34.919 --> 00:12:38.278
Caption: least organize your thought in a way

00:12:36.359 --> 00:12:39.958
Caption: where you can systematically feel like

00:12:38.278 --> 00:12:42.239
Caption: the goal posts are not moving you at

00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:44.398
Caption: least just slowly summing to that

00:12:42.239 --> 00:12:46.739
Caption: experience perfect example of when

00:12:44.398 --> 00:12:49.078
Caption: things change you can adjust it allows

00:12:46.739 --> 00:12:51.719
Caption: you to find Discovery gaps so my

00:12:49.078 --> 00:12:54.659
Caption: favorite is go Tada I&#39;m done and then a

00:12:51.719 --> 00:12:56.398
Caption: developer will be like well I okay

00:12:54.659 --> 00:12:58.199
Caption: you&#39;re close but not so have you thought

00:12:56.398 --> 00:13:00.239
Caption: about that that way does this go where

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.338
Caption: does bat go and all that stuff so that&#39;s

00:13:00.239 --> 00:13:03.898
Caption: a really good example for me where I can

00:13:02.338 --> 00:13:06.359
Caption: then go back and say

00:13:03.898 --> 00:13:08.458
Caption: cool let me add that to my future Trio

00:13:06.359 --> 00:13:11.398
Caption: story on that feature tree if you will

00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:14.159
Caption: and go I&#39;ll go back and I&#39;ll go

00:13:11.398 --> 00:13:15.539
Caption: um do some Discovery and lastly like

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:17.338
Caption: I&#39;ve probably already mentioned it gives

00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:18.898
Caption: us a bit of a seat at the strategy chat

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:20.700
Caption: so I&#39;m being lazy with the wording

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:22.559
Caption: strategy chats but when you&#39;ve

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.540
Caption: discovered stuff you understand user

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:26.760
Caption: problems you might think that the

00:13:24.539 --> 00:13:28.380
Caption: roadmap that was agreed to six months

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:31.018
Caption: ago is still up to date it&#39;s probably

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.760
Caption: not it allows us to give some input in

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:34.979
Caption: that reprioritization of work because

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.440
Caption: we&#39;ve done some of that discovery

00:13:34.979 --> 00:13:38.760
Caption: so from a development perspective should

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.440
Caption: be no surprise to you I&#39;m not a

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.179
Caption: developer so I&#39;ll try but this is what

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.458
Caption: my colleagues at Telstra purple have

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:46.979
Caption: mentioned it&#39;s helpful for so especially

00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:48.419
Caption: when you&#39;re a say for example it&#39;s a

00:13:46.979 --> 00:13:50.820
Caption: really long development gig it&#39;s a

00:13:48.419 --> 00:13:53.099
Caption: really established product onboarding a

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.200
Caption: new team member it&#39;s awesome so the

00:13:53.099 --> 00:13:56.819
Caption: example here on the right would be lots

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.440
Caption: of different features of a product I&#39;m

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.660
Caption: sure you can put together who it&#39;s for

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.578
Caption: and what it is so let&#39;s assume some of

00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:04.739
Caption: those features that could for example

00:14:02.578 --> 00:14:06.479
Caption: say you see that feature you know the

00:14:04.739 --> 00:14:09.059
Caption: second one from the left I&#39;ve worked on

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:11.039
Caption: that feature all of these Green Dots I

00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:12.958
Caption: built that with my own bare hands and My

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:14.278
Caption: Blood Sweat and Tears and this is what

00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.778
Caption: I&#39;ve learned when I did that oh you&#39;re

00:14:14.278 --> 00:14:18.119
Caption: going to join me working on that feature

00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:20.278
Caption: fantastic ignore the rest for now but if

00:14:18.119 --> 00:14:22.559
Caption: you ever encounter something go look for

00:14:20.278 --> 00:14:24.359
Caption: it find it in it at least at the very

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:26.458
Caption: least it allows you to navigate a bit of

00:14:24.359 --> 00:14:28.559
Caption: that uncertainty because I don&#39;t think a

00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:30.239
Caption: product backlog if you want to run some

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:32.099
Caption: fancy report of all the stories that

00:14:30.239 --> 00:14:33.838
Caption: were done where all the high story

00:14:32.099 --> 00:14:36.179
Caption: pointers which are the ones that dragged

00:14:33.838 --> 00:14:38.099
Caption: on six prints longer than of that kind

00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:40.500
Caption: of drama in a backlog maybe it doesn&#39;t

00:14:38.099 --> 00:14:42.239
Caption: give that story but at least this helps

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.679
Caption: you to come up for air and tell that

00:14:42.239 --> 00:14:46.198
Caption: story a little bit

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:47.458
Caption: so it visualizes the elastic scope and

00:14:46.198 --> 00:14:49.440
Caption: progress

00:14:47.458 --> 00:14:51.898
Caption: so we&#39;ll get into how we even get to

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.119
Caption: this point but again often taking a

00:14:51.898 --> 00:14:56.099
Caption: backlog and trying organizing it in a

00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:57.299
Caption: way that does conveniently over

00:14:56.099 --> 00:14:58.799
Caption: summarize always use that word

00:14:57.299 --> 00:15:00.419
Caption: conveniently because someone is just

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:03.059
Caption: just tell me what I need to know like

00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:05.458
Caption: but there&#39;s so much leader so if the

00:15:03.059 --> 00:15:07.260
Caption: point of getting here if your backlog is

00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:09.659
Caption: in a bit of a state because sometimes it

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.220
Caption: is and again teams like things the way

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:13.018
Caption: that they like them so if you&#39;re

00:15:11.219 --> 00:15:14.698
Caption: changing teams onboarded a new team

00:15:13.018 --> 00:15:16.320
Caption: member and you want to sort of reflect

00:15:14.698 --> 00:15:19.440
Caption: to how that team likes to work and

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.119
Caption: organize themselves then if the backlog

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.760
Caption: is a mess your feature tree will be a

00:15:21.119 --> 00:15:25.619
Caption: mess but yeah call me toxically positive

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.139
Caption: but that&#39;s an opportunity for a feature

00:15:25.619 --> 00:15:31.440
Caption: tree so you can reorganize that work

00:15:28.138 --> 00:15:33.299
Caption: then so that for the most bit for the

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.179
Caption: almost everyone working on this product

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:37.979
Caption: or an example of up if you want to so so

00:15:36.179 --> 00:15:40.078
Caption: radically put yourself out there and

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:42.778
Caption: make it that ultimate accountability of

00:15:40.078 --> 00:15:44.940
Caption: here&#39;s what I&#39;m doing it visualizes that

00:15:42.778 --> 00:15:46.260
Caption: and it just allows you to say this is

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.940
Caption: what I&#39;ve done this is what I&#39;m doing

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.338
Caption: and this is what&#39;s coming up next

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:52.018
Caption: the last bullet here empowers autonomy

00:15:50.338 --> 00:15:53.518
Caption: is a bit like what a designer feels like

00:15:52.018 --> 00:15:55.440
Caption: but I&#39;ve got input to give into the

00:15:53.518 --> 00:15:57.299
Caption: order because users want this more than

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.778
Caption: what you think they wanted there or

00:15:57.299 --> 00:16:02.698
Caption: months ago similar story here in that if

00:16:00.778 --> 00:16:04.739
Caption: we&#39;ve got a specific feature especially

00:16:02.698 --> 00:16:06.838
Caption: things that are two or three or four

00:16:04.739 --> 00:16:09.119
Caption: Sprints ahead and we say this is a bit

00:16:06.838 --> 00:16:12.359
Caption: of functionality that we want to develop

00:16:09.119 --> 00:16:14.638
Caption: but a product owner had a brilliant idea

00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:16.619
Caption: overnight or promised some functionality

00:16:14.638 --> 00:16:18.599
Caption: at a pub last night whatever story it

00:16:16.619 --> 00:16:21.719
Caption: rings through then you want to introduce

00:16:18.599 --> 00:16:23.759
Caption: new functionality then or immediately a

00:16:21.719 --> 00:16:25.979
Caption: developer would say for example with a

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.778
Caption: feature tree okay you see all of this

00:16:25.979 --> 00:16:29.278
Caption: functionality we&#39;ve got over here I

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:31.198
Caption: don&#39;t think we&#39;ve got time or the

00:16:29.278 --> 00:16:33.958
Caption: Technical Resources for example to get

00:16:31.198 --> 00:16:35.698
Caption: any of that if we introduce that and it

00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.859
Caption: just facilitates that needful

00:16:35.698 --> 00:16:40.500
Caption: conversation about always you know

00:16:37.859 --> 00:16:42.659
Caption: keeping the what&#39;s next in Focus so that

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:45.599
Caption: you can you can focus on that while

00:16:42.659 --> 00:16:47.099
Caption: having a plan for what&#39;s to come so

00:16:45.599 --> 00:16:48.419
Caption: that&#39;s why I like them in that context

00:16:47.099 --> 00:16:51.778
Caption: as well

00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:53.278
Caption: so let&#39;s keep the head there why product

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:55.078
Caption: owners love it they&#39;re not not just

00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:57.299
Caption: product owners it&#39;s people working on

00:16:55.078 --> 00:16:59.398
Caption: products in that product since in its

00:16:57.299 --> 00:17:01.979
Caption: broadest possible colorful meaning

00:16:59.398 --> 00:17:04.678
Caption: if it&#39;s multiple trees is it a feature

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:07.260
Caption: Forest who knows so this could be

00:17:04.678 --> 00:17:09.119
Caption: multiple feature trees and what we do

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.640
Caption: here for example again not my project

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:14.520
Caption: but it was used to affect the air more

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:17.880
Caption: in the map context let&#39;s just visualize

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.859
Caption: what we&#39;re doing a big big stream of

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.540
Caption: work with multiple teams working on

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:23.698
Caption: multiple things so it can get complex

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:26.640
Caption: quite quickly but what we&#39;re trying to

00:17:23.698 --> 00:17:28.198
Caption: do is get a lay or visualize it this is

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.839
Caption: an online whiteboarding tool doesn&#39;t

00:17:28.198 --> 00:17:32.579
Caption: always have to be presentation ready if

00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:34.439
Caption: you will but it doesn&#39;t even it can even

00:17:32.579 --> 00:17:35.880
Caption: be a scribble but just have a

00:17:34.439 --> 00:17:37.199
Caption: visualization of everything we&#39;re

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.239
Caption: working on and that&#39;s where the color

00:17:37.199 --> 00:17:41.519
Caption: coding here comes in we&#39;ve built all of

00:17:39.239 --> 00:17:43.380
Caption: this stuff this is getting for example

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.419
Caption: data from a platform that we&#39;re retiring

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.699
Caption: in six months we&#39;re gonna have holes

00:17:45.418 --> 00:17:49.619
Caption: here and this is what&#39;s coming up and

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:51.678
Caption: what that also allows people to do for

00:17:49.619 --> 00:17:55.260
Caption: example is budget Cycles

00:17:51.678 --> 00:17:57.000
Caption: but they exist so how much casola do you

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.280
Caption: need for the next 12 months okay cool

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.280
Caption: let&#39;s do a very cursory estimate I think

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.719
Caption: will focus on this section let&#39;s see if

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.539
Caption: we&#39;ve got the right people the right

00:18:03.719 --> 00:18:08.400
Caption: skill sets the right time allotted and

00:18:06.538 --> 00:18:10.678
Caption: things like that and then you can do an

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.900
Caption: estimate on something like this so if

00:18:10.678 --> 00:18:15.178
Caption: you&#39;re a product owner working on

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.520
Caption: multiple products think of a way that at

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:19.380
Caption: least we can dive into the detail from

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.940
Caption: here or come up for air and at least

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.160
Caption: depending on which direction in your

00:18:20.939 --> 00:18:24.659
Caption: organization you kind of tell the story

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.119
Caption: of your product

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.739
Caption: and then why project people are again I

00:18:27.119 --> 00:18:30.719
Caption: refuse the words they go to the sound so

00:18:28.739 --> 00:18:32.939
Caption: clunky but then here&#39;s me again cross

00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:35.520
Caption: capability streams of work anyway so

00:18:32.939 --> 00:18:37.079
Caption: cross capability streams of work

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.640
Caption: um if you&#39;ve got multiple teams again

00:18:37.079 --> 00:18:41.099
Caption: with multiple skill sets there might be

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.780
Caption: a team for example here in Perth say if

00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:44.160
Caption: we&#39;ve got a team over East and they&#39;re

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.020
Caption: working on a piece of functionality

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.640
Caption: maybe their own team wants their own

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.320
Caption: backlog you might actually separate

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.479
Caption: different backlogs for things like this

00:18:49.319 --> 00:18:53.699
Caption: but you&#39;re at least able to organize

00:18:51.479 --> 00:18:56.400
Caption: work in the way that you want and then

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:57.899
Caption: visualize it accordingly so very easily

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.539
Caption: we could say that column on the far

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.280
Caption: right that&#39;s actually you know the team

00:19:00.538 --> 00:19:03.959
Caption: in Sydney that one is the team in

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.400
Caption: Melbourne this is the Perth team for

00:19:03.959 --> 00:19:08.099
Caption: example you could do things like that as

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.780
Caption: well I&#39;ve mentioned the color coding a

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:11.459
Caption: few times now it&#39;s just a simple

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.380
Caption: artifact think of it as like a traffic

00:19:11.459 --> 00:19:16.319
Caption: sort of light system

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:18.058
Caption: it sets expectations in a way as well in

00:19:16.319 --> 00:19:19.979
Caption: public facing products so for example

00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:21.659
Caption: there&#39;s a new piece of functionality we

00:19:19.979 --> 00:19:23.520
Caption: want to get the marketing team involved

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.559
Caption: to celebrate the the launch of something

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.539
Caption: for example they need to know when they

00:19:25.558 --> 00:19:30.119
Caption: need to get ready that kind of thing so

00:19:27.538 --> 00:19:32.879
Caption: you could for example have ready to

00:19:30.119 --> 00:19:34.500
Caption: launch and then that team could say okay

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.418
Caption: they&#39;ll change the color once there

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.038
Caption: things are in order but this is very

00:19:36.418 --> 00:19:40.319
Caption: much focused on the development of the

00:19:38.038 --> 00:19:42.659
Caption: product and what&#39;s live for a user today

00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:44.459
Caption: and then a small underrated feature as

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.979
Caption: well you&#39;ll probably discover some other

00:19:44.459 --> 00:19:49.260
Caption: ones as well but it can link directly to

00:19:46.979 --> 00:19:51.719
Caption: a product backlog as well I don&#39;t know

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.520
Caption: how many organizations allow the people

00:19:51.719 --> 00:19:55.199
Caption: to come in and leave notes on user

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.940
Caption: stories and stuff like that depending on

00:19:55.199 --> 00:19:58.558
Caption: your culture depending on where you are

00:19:56.939 --> 00:20:00.359
Caption: but people can always ask questions

00:19:58.558 --> 00:20:02.880
Caption: especially if they&#39;ve got helpful input

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:04.798
Caption: so that one little random dot over there

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.260
Caption: that looks interesting what&#39;s that about

00:20:04.798 --> 00:20:09.359
Caption: you can just sort of put brackets at the

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.760
Caption: end put the user Story ID they usually

00:20:09.359 --> 00:20:14.520
Caption: have numbers hyperlink that you click on

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:17.640
Caption: that it opens if you not been blocked

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:19.919
Caption: from the project so it should open so

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.320
Caption: that&#39;s sort of how these different user

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:24.298
Caption: groups have benefit from there you&#39;ll

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:26.459
Caption: also see one column there again not my

00:20:24.298 --> 00:20:28.380
Caption: specific project or feature tree but in

00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:30.839
Caption: this instance arriving at this

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:34.140
Caption: complicated feature tree was a great way

00:20:30.839 --> 00:20:36.959
Caption: of just visualizing the sheer volume of

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.700
Caption: work we think we&#39;ve committed to but the

00:20:36.959 --> 00:20:41.099
Caption: spoilers none of this can always happen

00:20:38.699 --> 00:20:42.779
Caption: before say August that year so there was

00:20:41.099 --> 00:20:45.178
Caption: a column an entire feature where they

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:47.820
Caption: said if we want something that is

00:20:45.178 --> 00:20:49.678
Caption: polished end-to-end vertically slides

00:20:47.819 --> 00:20:52.019
Caption: it&#39;s got the full real piece of

00:20:49.678 --> 00:20:53.880
Caption: functionality let&#39;s de-prioritize some

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.619
Caption: functionality on the right so that was

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:58.520
Caption: my understanding how this was of impact

00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:58.520
Caption: for that specific product

00:20:58.798 --> 00:21:03.599
Caption: when do we plant feature trees I love

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.400
Caption: these metaphors so you can either in a

00:21:03.599 --> 00:21:07.500
Caption: Consulting context often there&#39;s a need

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.299
Caption: for one so we we work with an existing

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.339
Caption: product again even the process of

00:21:09.298 --> 00:21:13.558
Caption: onboarding an entirely new team to a

00:21:11.339 --> 00:21:15.298
Caption: product they may want just to use it as

00:21:13.558 --> 00:21:18.479
Caption: part of their intuition building phase

00:21:15.298 --> 00:21:20.159
Caption: you know any two three four Sprints at

00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:22.319
Caption: time you will need to build intuition

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.359
Caption: about a product spoilers make a feature

00:21:22.319 --> 00:21:25.798
Caption: tree because you could organize your own

00:21:24.359 --> 00:21:27.298
Caption: thought you can replay your

00:21:25.798 --> 00:21:29.459
Caption: understanding to someone that&#39;s been on

00:21:27.298 --> 00:21:30.779
Caption: the project for a long while it&#39;s going

00:21:29.459 --> 00:21:32.579
Caption: to have to iterate a few times but

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.260
Caption: there&#39;s that magic point of like oh okay

00:21:32.579 --> 00:21:35.880
Caption: we see it the same way and that&#39;s really

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.619
Caption: a good point where people can start

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.359
Caption: becoming autonomous in their decisions

00:21:37.619 --> 00:21:41.579
Caption: and things like that

00:21:39.359 --> 00:21:42.839
Caption: but spoilers is usually about this at

00:21:41.579 --> 00:21:44.519
Caption: least from some of our experiences

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:47.400
Caption: that&#39;s why I use the fire extinguisher

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.900
Caption: on the right I use the knife for me when

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.400
Caption: you&#39;ve done a polished I mentioned

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.020
Caption: before we&#39;ve done this polished

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.940
Caption: prototype it looks beautiful it&#39;s

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.739
Caption: awesome now we need to answer those

00:21:53.939 --> 00:21:57.658
Caption: difficult questions of how do we make it

00:21:55.739 --> 00:21:59.880
Caption: real how do we cut pieces of

00:21:57.659 --> 00:22:02.100
Caption: functionality and that&#39;s why I like the

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:05.400
Caption: knife so we call it story slicing so

00:22:02.099 --> 00:22:07.140
Caption: let&#39;s go into the first example

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.000
Caption: of how you grow one when you&#39;re working

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:10.739
Caption: with an existing backlog so you&#39;ve got

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.079
Caption: your backlog hopefully it might be a two

00:22:10.739 --> 00:22:16.079
Caption: like jira or Azure devops you might use

00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:18.439
Caption: like a kanban style thing like Trello

00:22:16.079 --> 00:22:20.699
Caption: for example if you&#39;re using this in a

00:22:18.439 --> 00:22:22.500
Caption: non-product space just to organize your

00:22:20.699 --> 00:22:25.439
Caption: shopping lists for example some of you

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:27.479
Caption: so um if you you take your list whatever

00:22:25.439 --> 00:22:30.119
Caption: list you have it&#39;s probably in a tool

00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:32.819
Caption: somewhere command or control I export

00:22:30.119 --> 00:22:34.739
Caption: CSV get it in a workable format so now

00:22:32.819 --> 00:22:36.959
Caption: at least you&#39;re not distracted by what

00:22:34.739 --> 00:22:37.918
Caption: it is you just have a clean list of what

00:22:36.959 --> 00:22:39.959
Caption: it is

00:22:37.918 --> 00:22:42.058
Caption: now you can probably make a decision do

00:22:39.959 --> 00:22:43.859
Caption: you work in a physical copy or a digital

00:22:42.058 --> 00:22:44.939
Caption: copy so there&#39;s lots of awesome digital

00:22:43.859 --> 00:22:47.158
Caption: tools

00:22:44.939 --> 00:22:49.139
Caption: if your team if you sense we&#39;re not

00:22:47.159 --> 00:22:51.299
Caption: aligned we can&#39;t talk about the backlog

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.678
Caption: in the same way as in you cringe when

00:22:51.298 --> 00:22:54.599
Caption: people think they mentioned the

00:22:52.678 --> 00:22:57.359
Caption: priorities in a little bit of do this

00:22:54.599 --> 00:22:59.939
Caption: together but do it in person so I would

00:22:57.359 --> 00:23:02.280
Caption: recommend you know those nice 3M the

00:22:59.939 --> 00:23:05.879
Caption: ones with the nice glue use physical

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:08.640
Caption: Post-it notes and then write one Post-It

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.440
Caption: note per user story so you&#39;ve got your

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.719
Caption: backlog with a long list of user stories

00:23:10.439 --> 00:23:14.399
Caption: I&#39;ve seen six seven eight hundred long

00:23:12.719 --> 00:23:16.319
Caption: story backlogs

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.239
Caption: you did this to yourself write it all

00:23:16.319 --> 00:23:20.158
Caption: out okay so now we&#39;ve got Post-it notes

00:23:18.239 --> 00:23:22.140
Caption: of all of our user stories

00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:23.880
Caption: in the world of user research there&#39;s

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.640
Caption: this activity we like to call card

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.319
Caption: sorting it&#39;s typically used to sort the

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.760
Caption: information architecture or the way that

00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:32.038
Caption: users navigate it&#39;s just what people

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.780
Caption: commonly associate with for example

00:23:32.038 --> 00:23:35.759
Caption: features or Pages or things like that

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.919
Caption: and it&#39;s essentially like playing snap

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.079
Caption: with your inside so what you want to do

00:23:37.918 --> 00:23:41.880
Caption: is I&#39;ve got you just start sequentially

00:23:40.079 --> 00:23:43.678
Caption: maybe even hand a couple of Post-it

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.959
Caption: notes out to the team do this sort of in

00:23:43.678 --> 00:23:48.000
Caption: a workshop format and say right you&#39;ve

00:23:45.959 --> 00:23:50.279
Caption: got a Post-It note there read it out

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.260
Caption: that&#39;s that one you go next is it the

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.580
Caption: same or is it different if you&#39;re

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.979
Caption: working from your product backlog

00:23:53.579 --> 00:23:57.779
Caption: sequentially first story to last it

00:23:55.979 --> 00:24:00.178
Caption: might be clear in the beginning but it

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.039
Caption: might unravel towards the end so trick

00:24:00.178 --> 00:24:03.599
Caption: shuffle them up and then start fresh so

00:24:02.038 --> 00:24:05.699
Caption: we&#39;re not anchored by the thought that

00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:07.739
Caption: went into it but if if it&#39;s good load

00:24:05.699 --> 00:24:09.719
Caption: keep it work from the top so just do

00:24:07.739 --> 00:24:11.339
Caption: what&#39;s right for your team but over time

00:24:09.719 --> 00:24:14.400
Caption: what&#39;s going to emerge are these

00:24:11.339 --> 00:24:17.939
Caption: hopefully organic hopefully intuitive

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:20.640
Caption: groups of sets of features and that&#39;s

00:24:17.939 --> 00:24:22.979
Caption: what can start forming the headers of

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:25.020
Caption: your feature tree so my biggest tip I

00:24:22.979 --> 00:24:28.079
Caption: can give you as well steal from what&#39;s

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:29.700
Caption: real yo so you&#39;ve got if it&#39;s an

00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:31.439
Caption: existing product you can probably

00:24:29.699 --> 00:24:34.139
Caption: already navigate through it so it&#39;s got

00:24:31.439 --> 00:24:36.298
Caption: a home page it&#39;s got in the up example a

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.339
Caption: payments page an information section

00:24:36.298 --> 00:24:40.678
Caption: it&#39;s got all of that already if you&#39;re

00:24:38.339 --> 00:24:42.058
Caption: struggling to synthesize that&#39;s the word

00:24:40.678 --> 00:24:43.558
Caption: we use to gather thought if you&#39;re

00:24:42.058 --> 00:24:46.619
Caption: struggling to synthesize all of these

00:24:43.558 --> 00:24:48.599
Caption: Post-it notes into Mass sort of adopted

00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:50.819
Caption: or intuitive headings just take from

00:24:48.599 --> 00:24:52.619
Caption: what you have it&#39;s it&#39;s perfectly fine

00:24:50.819 --> 00:24:53.939
Caption: if you&#39;re designing a more internal

00:24:52.619 --> 00:24:56.520
Caption: facing product and it&#39;s a business

00:24:53.939 --> 00:24:58.199
Caption: process like a Nifty little payroll

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.940
Caption: chatbot or one of those cool ideas

00:24:58.199 --> 00:25:01.439
Caption: people come up with all the time you

00:24:59.939 --> 00:25:03.599
Caption: might just have steps to your approval

00:25:01.439 --> 00:25:06.479
Caption: process just leverage what&#39;s real start

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:10.798
Caption: there and over time allow your tree to

00:25:06.479 --> 00:25:12.959
Caption: grow so we&#39;ve got the next one Focus now

00:25:10.798 --> 00:25:14.639
Caption: specifically for example on the pile of

00:25:12.959 --> 00:25:16.439
Caption: the green Post-it notes that&#39;s just an

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.359
Caption: arbitrary visual example but we&#39;ve got a

00:25:16.439 --> 00:25:22.319
Caption: set this is a feature we&#39;re focusing on

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:24.418
Caption: that feature now is the good time to ask

00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:26.459
Caption: does this actually make sense so we&#39;ve

00:25:24.418 --> 00:25:27.899
Caption: got a feature let&#39;s use the app example

00:25:26.459 --> 00:25:29.760
Caption: again payments

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:32.099
Caption: they may want to integrate in future

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.079
Caption: with more payment platforms add new

00:25:32.099 --> 00:25:35.760
Caption: stories it&#39;s not detailed stories I&#39;m

00:25:34.079 --> 00:25:38.640
Caption: not talking about all of the requirement

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.320
Caption: Gatherings I&#39;m just mentioning a mental

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.459
Caption: placeholder for all the things you still

00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:42.959
Caption: want to add to that feature because

00:25:41.459 --> 00:25:45.119
Caption: that&#39;s a bit more representative of what

00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:47.520
Caption: you want to do in that space and at the

00:25:45.119 --> 00:25:48.298
Caption: same time if there&#39;s Monkey Business in

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.400
Caption: there

00:25:48.298 --> 00:25:52.319
Caption: cut it just get rid of it it&#39;s probably

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.719
Caption: the hardest thing to do for people to

00:25:52.319 --> 00:25:56.519
Caption: separate with just this Legacy things

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:58.079
Caption: that every new team there&#39;s just that

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.419
Caption: bottom of the style bottom of the

00:25:58.079 --> 00:26:02.880
Caption: backlog just get rid of it if you&#39;re not

00:26:00.418 --> 00:26:04.798
Caption: comfortable crashing it completely put

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.599
Caption: it in a section like de-prioritized

00:26:04.798 --> 00:26:08.219
Caption: maybe there is going to be that

00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:10.140
Caption: investment that&#39;s going to unlock a new

00:26:08.219 --> 00:26:12.178
Caption: platform that allows that feature to

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:14.159
Caption: then become prioritize hold on to it

00:26:12.178 --> 00:26:15.839
Caption: especially if there is some usable

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:17.580
Caption: Discovery that&#39;s been done on it or

00:26:15.839 --> 00:26:21.058
Caption: prototypes or things like that hold on

00:26:17.579 --> 00:26:22.918
Caption: to it you can do that again with your

00:26:21.058 --> 00:26:25.500
Caption: entire team present I would highly

00:26:22.918 --> 00:26:26.880
Caption: recommend at least representatives of

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.918
Caption: all those groups that I&#39;ve mentioned

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.500
Caption: before because then we can start that

00:26:28.918 --> 00:26:33.839
Caption: conversation but what it does it builds

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:36.119
Caption: context of the content in the backlog

00:26:33.839 --> 00:26:37.798
Caption: really nicely it could take a bit of

00:26:36.119 --> 00:26:40.079
Caption: time if you&#39;ve got a really really big

00:26:37.798 --> 00:26:42.178
Caption: product but stagger it maybe have a

00:26:40.079 --> 00:26:44.699
Caption: focus session for each of these features

00:26:42.178 --> 00:26:47.339
Caption: so you stagger them out and lastly now

00:26:44.699 --> 00:26:50.099
Caption: pull it together simple right easy so

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:52.140
Caption: this is not a talk about prioritization

00:26:50.099 --> 00:26:54.538
Caption: that&#39;s a whole separate talk so how we

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.279
Caption: go about prioritizing stories but let&#39;s

00:26:54.538 --> 00:26:58.558
Caption: look at the output of prioritization

00:26:56.279 --> 00:27:01.559
Caption: that is the order in which we&#39;re doing

00:26:58.558 --> 00:27:03.778
Caption: things per feature so that&#39;s where the

00:27:01.558 --> 00:27:05.939
Caption: order of the feature streets feature

00:27:03.779 --> 00:27:08.520
Caption: Tree starts coming in what are we doing

00:27:05.939 --> 00:27:10.439
Caption: first from a specific feature organize

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.659
Caption: that top to bottom and then left to

00:27:10.439 --> 00:27:15.000
Caption: right on your feature that could be in

00:27:12.659 --> 00:27:17.159
Caption: onto the user Journey it could be hinged

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.779
Caption: under the highest value features or the

00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:20.760
Caption: features that have the only earliest

00:27:18.779 --> 00:27:22.080
Caption: Milestone date whatever order makes

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.760
Caption: sense for you so we&#39;ve got all of our

00:27:22.079 --> 00:27:25.678
Caption: green Post-it notes and we order them

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.959
Caption: and all of our other buckets everyone

00:27:25.678 --> 00:27:30.058
Caption: loves sort of a junk drawer have an

00:27:27.959 --> 00:27:31.678
Caption: other bucket be kind to yourself

00:27:30.058 --> 00:27:33.899
Caption: when you&#39;re pulling this together that

00:27:31.678 --> 00:27:35.699
Caption: little asterisk if you spotted it

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.799
Caption: that&#39;s the things to keep in mind so

00:27:35.699 --> 00:27:40.678
Caption: lots of words on a slide here sorry not

00:27:37.798 --> 00:27:42.239
Caption: sorry so the first thing to do is who is

00:27:40.678 --> 00:27:45.298
Caption: your audience of your featured tree

00:27:42.239 --> 00:27:46.859
Caption: don&#39;t be too ambitious because that puts

00:27:45.298 --> 00:27:48.658
Caption: pressure of making something like this

00:27:46.859 --> 00:27:50.819
Caption: I&#39;ll acknowledge that it is a bit of

00:27:48.659 --> 00:27:53.520
Caption: manual effort to get started at first

00:27:50.819 --> 00:27:55.259
Caption: this is 2022 who knows maybe it&#39;s the

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:57.239
Caption: next feature for them to work on saying

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.798
Caption: jira to have the ability if you sort

00:27:57.239 --> 00:28:00.658
Caption: your stories right to automate something

00:27:58.798 --> 00:28:01.678
Caption: like this wouldn&#39;t this be awesome so

00:28:00.659 --> 00:28:03.179
Caption: we&#39;re going to look back at this talk

00:28:01.678 --> 00:28:06.538
Caption: and be like oh that&#39;s the cassette tape

00:28:03.178 --> 00:28:08.158
Caption: or the floppy disk of 2022 so um but

00:28:06.538 --> 00:28:10.139
Caption: this side who is the audience of your

00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:11.760
Caption: feature Tree in apps case they went bold

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.260
Caption: they said it&#39;s the public we want to

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.239
Caption: keep ourselves accountable to that

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.279
Caption: that&#39;s the kind of product centered or

00:28:15.239 --> 00:28:20.400
Caption: culture that we want to drive for but if

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:22.020
Caption: you&#39;ve got a leave a leave booking chat

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.719
Caption: Bots you probably won&#39;t do that so just

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:27.000
Caption: start small be humble be you know begin

00:28:24.719 --> 00:28:30.058
Caption: small and then answer the next question

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.859
Caption: is it at the right level of detail we&#39;ve

00:28:30.058 --> 00:28:33.719
Caption: got on your feature tree typically it&#39;s

00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:36.658
Caption: the product you might want to go epics

00:28:33.719 --> 00:28:39.178
Caption: and in a list of features a branch for

00:28:36.659 --> 00:28:40.860
Caption: each story or we&#39;ve got even a lower

00:28:39.178 --> 00:28:43.140
Caption: level of detail to a story could be

00:28:40.859 --> 00:28:45.778
Caption: something like a task depending on what

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:47.880
Caption: structure if this test steps you might

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:50.159
Caption: sometimes use as a task in your Azure

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.900
Caption: backlog for example decide what&#39;s right

00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:54.600
Caption: for the team

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:56.159
Caption: don&#39;t start too detailed we love detail

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:57.778
Caption: when we start something because we just

00:28:56.159 --> 00:29:00.240
Caption: want that confidence that it is in there

00:28:57.779 --> 00:29:02.039
Caption: but if we are engaged in the process

00:29:00.239 --> 00:29:04.199
Caption: it&#39;s okay to drop some of the detail off

00:29:02.038 --> 00:29:05.099
Caption: and just visualize it so then we need to

00:29:04.199 --> 00:29:07.859
Caption: answer

00:29:05.099 --> 00:29:09.719
Caption: what format is Right designers in the

00:29:07.859 --> 00:29:11.459
Caption: room don&#39;t do it in illustrator because

00:29:09.719 --> 00:29:12.719
Caption: then you automatically become the owner

00:29:11.459 --> 00:29:14.939
Caption: because you&#39;re the only one that can

00:29:12.719 --> 00:29:17.699
Caption: edit it use a tool that is easily

00:29:14.939 --> 00:29:20.639
Caption: editable so like a mural of the world or

00:29:17.699 --> 00:29:22.139
Caption: I say Miro you say Miro or fig Jam

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.640
Caption: there&#39;s lots of online whiteboarding

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.159
Caption: tools that&#39;s actually quite accessible

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:29.039
Caption: to use it&#39;s shareable with the URL you

00:29:26.159 --> 00:29:30.539
Caption: can make it sort of semi public and you

00:29:29.038 --> 00:29:33.298
Caption: can just change the Post-it notes as

00:29:30.538 --> 00:29:35.278
Caption: they go the last two is also related to

00:29:33.298 --> 00:29:37.139
Caption: one another is who will own it you might

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:38.880
Caption: think that it&#39;s intuitive for a single

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.279
Caption: person to own it like a product owner

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.619
Caption: you own a product unit you own it you

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:46.140
Caption: update it it&#39;s a lot of work if you not

00:29:43.619 --> 00:29:48.418
Caption: maintaining it so if it&#39;s just a map if

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.739
Caption: it&#39;s just a point in time document you

00:29:48.418 --> 00:29:52.079
Caption: can probably go a bit detailed but

00:29:49.739 --> 00:29:54.119
Caption: acknowledge that Simon has a PDF don&#39;t

00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:55.439
Caption: even tempt people to think it&#39;s quickly

00:29:54.119 --> 00:29:57.599
Caption: editable because there is a lot of

00:29:55.439 --> 00:29:58.918
Caption: detail on it I will acknowledge but if

00:29:57.599 --> 00:30:01.380
Caption: it is something that you&#39;re embedding

00:29:58.918 --> 00:30:03.178
Caption: for example in your agile ceremonies so

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.159
Caption: for example a common two-week Sprint

00:30:03.178 --> 00:30:07.140
Caption: structure at the end you might have a

00:30:05.159 --> 00:30:09.659
Caption: bit of a showcase that ah these are all

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.520
Caption: the stuff we did we thought we would do

00:30:09.659 --> 00:30:13.559
Caption: we didn&#39;t get through it&#39;s at that point

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.880
Caption: in time if it&#39;s hopefully set up in a

00:30:13.558 --> 00:30:16.979
Caption: format where you can just quickly change

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.719
Caption: the colors of the Post-it notes maybe

00:30:16.979 --> 00:30:21.178
Caption: once a month move the order if things

00:30:18.719 --> 00:30:23.278
Caption: change but if we embed it in our agile

00:30:21.178 --> 00:30:25.140
Caption: ceremonies it&#39;s a really nice way to

00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:26.760
Caption: start a Sprint showcase especially if

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.678
Caption: there are broader stakeholders in that

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:31.140
Caption: group I said the word so if there&#39;s

00:30:28.678 --> 00:30:33.479
Caption: other people in a showcase that might

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.880
Caption: not have the lowest level of detail oh

00:30:33.479 --> 00:30:37.678
Caption: so where are we on the chatbot and then

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.839
Caption: you could say cool we&#39;ve started that

00:30:37.678 --> 00:30:42.239
Caption: for example visually and then go into

00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:44.219
Caption: the more detail which is yeah sharing

00:30:42.239 --> 00:30:47.579
Caption: some of that so I&#39;ll speed up a bit so

00:30:44.219 --> 00:30:49.619
Caption: now we&#39;re working with a new backlog a

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:52.739
Caption: new product we&#39;ve just done Discovery

00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:54.599
Caption: there is a brand new shiny prototype how

00:30:52.739 --> 00:30:55.979
Caption: do we stare at a blank screen and go

00:30:54.599 --> 00:30:58.979
Caption: where do we start that&#39;s very

00:30:55.979 --> 00:31:02.158
Caption: intimidating I&#39;ll admit even for me so

00:30:58.979 --> 00:31:03.898
Caption: the five E&#39;s of service design like if

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:05.460
Caption: this is an educational talk this is a

00:31:03.899 --> 00:31:07.860
Caption: thing I might expose you to who knows

00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:09.719
Caption: but the five ease of service design is

00:31:07.859 --> 00:31:12.119
Caption: just a construct that service designers

00:31:09.719 --> 00:31:14.219
Caption: like myself use to navigate a user

00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:16.140
Caption: journey and spoilers it&#39;s so simple so

00:31:14.219 --> 00:31:19.079
Caption: hopefully you can use some of it before

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:21.058
Caption: I jump into what they are and we again

00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:22.739
Caption: you map out the user journey and how to

00:31:21.058 --> 00:31:24.239
Caption: translate that to a backlog I just want

00:31:22.739 --> 00:31:26.339
Caption: to share an example

00:31:24.239 --> 00:31:28.140
Caption: I want to say again deliberately low

00:31:26.339 --> 00:31:29.880
Caption: quality but I didn&#39;t have access to this

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:32.159
Caption: anymore so I just took a screenshot of

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:35.099
Caption: what I have but here what we&#39;ll see is a

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:37.980
Caption: problem that we solved for a wi insurer

00:31:35.099 --> 00:31:39.719
Caption: so what they were trying to do is

00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:41.880
Caption: um release functionality so that their

00:31:39.719 --> 00:31:44.880
Caption: users can cancel their insurance policy

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:47.699
Caption: online now questions asked go in press

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.020
Caption: cancel it&#39;s done instant refund in our

00:31:47.699 --> 00:31:50.760
Caption: research what was really awesome is

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.260
Caption: there&#39;s no other insurer to our

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.779
Caption: knowledge that allows you to do that in

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.039
Caption: Australia so represent wa which is

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:57.960
Caption: awesome

00:31:56.038 --> 00:31:59.819
Caption: um but we needed to design for an

00:31:57.959 --> 00:32:02.459
Caption: experience here and after we had our

00:31:59.819 --> 00:32:03.839
Caption: prototype we were able to arrive semi at

00:32:02.459 --> 00:32:05.640
Caption: this point so I&#39;ll set you through some

00:32:03.839 --> 00:32:07.678
Caption: of the detail and then I&#39;ll get to the

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.119
Caption: five is how you can remember the

00:32:07.678 --> 00:32:10.678
Caption: structure for yourself if you&#39;re trying

00:32:09.119 --> 00:32:13.439
Caption: to do something like this

00:32:10.678 --> 00:32:15.599
Caption: so on the left that first feature this

00:32:13.439 --> 00:32:16.918
Caption: is a working draft the early days the

00:32:15.599 --> 00:32:18.479
Caption: ugly version of a feature tree and

00:32:16.918 --> 00:32:20.398
Caption: that&#39;s okay I don&#39;t even think we

00:32:18.479 --> 00:32:22.020
Caption: iterated the Fidelity after this we kind

00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:23.039
Caption: of just kept it kind of there it served

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:25.979
Caption: its purpose

00:32:23.038 --> 00:32:27.839
Caption: access how do users get into this

00:32:25.979 --> 00:32:30.599
Caption: experience let&#39;s talk about it as a form

00:32:27.839 --> 00:32:32.459
Caption: so how do users access this cancellation

00:32:30.599 --> 00:32:34.500
Caption: form so these are all the things we&#39;re

00:32:32.459 --> 00:32:36.959
Caption: considering today they&#39;ve got a platform

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:39.359
Caption: a portal you can log into let&#39;s leverage

00:32:36.959 --> 00:32:41.038
Caption: a cancel button there lots of cool ideas

00:32:39.359 --> 00:32:43.558
Caption: we have in the future but we stagger

00:32:41.038 --> 00:32:46.379
Caption: them out focus on Priority First the

00:32:43.558 --> 00:32:47.880
Caption: next four so the view policy details of

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.558
Caption: course you want to be sure you&#39;re

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:51.659
Caption: canceling the right policy so let&#39;s pull

00:32:49.558 --> 00:32:53.278
Caption: up that information that&#39;s where the

00:32:51.659 --> 00:32:54.659
Caption: interesting stuff starts presenting

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:55.980
Caption: information in a simple way that&#39;s

00:32:54.659 --> 00:32:57.840
Caption: relevant to that place you&#39;ve just

00:32:55.979 --> 00:33:00.000
Caption: clicked from you want to select the

00:32:57.839 --> 00:33:01.798
Caption: cancellation reason this is not just an

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.719
Caption: information grab it depends on the

00:33:01.798 --> 00:33:05.459
Caption: reason you&#39;re canceling depends on your

00:33:03.719 --> 00:33:07.380
Caption: refund and the terms and conditions and

00:33:05.459 --> 00:33:09.479
Caption: stuff like that it also helps the

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.760
Caption: customer service of course then there&#39;s

00:33:09.479 --> 00:33:13.260
Caption: the date and the refund so we want to

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.298
Caption: know when are you can select from

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:18.239
Caption: depending on your reason there&#39;s some

00:33:15.298 --> 00:33:19.979
Caption: rules and depending on what um what kind

00:33:18.239 --> 00:33:21.538
Caption: of policy you have your refund amount

00:33:19.979 --> 00:33:23.819
Caption: might look different shout out to my

00:33:21.538 --> 00:33:26.038
Caption: Boomers some of them pay cash once a

00:33:23.819 --> 00:33:29.278
Caption: year that&#39;s a whole other refund Journey

00:33:26.038 --> 00:33:30.719
Caption: than the online credit card ones so for

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:32.159
Caption: example these are all the things we

00:33:30.719 --> 00:33:33.839
Caption: needed to navigate and we&#39;re like right

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:35.760
Caption: there&#39;s you know lots of different user

00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:37.918
Caption: groups and things like that editing your

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.019
Caption: details might as well you&#39;re there and

00:33:37.918 --> 00:33:42.538
Caption: in the confirmation so what I&#39;m taking

00:33:40.019 --> 00:33:44.640
Caption: you through is the user journey of for

00:33:42.538 --> 00:33:47.759
Caption: example the end result of our Discovery

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:50.099
Caption: and that&#39;s how we chunked it up for our

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:52.140
Caption: backlog so if you want the ability to

00:33:50.099 --> 00:33:53.278
Caption: recall or replicate something like this

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.140
Caption: for yourself

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:57.000
Caption: this is where the five ease of service

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.558
Caption: design come in I&#39;m not starting at the

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.839
Caption: first one I&#39;ll tell you in a second why

00:33:58.558 --> 00:34:03.418
Caption: but let&#39;s go with that second one enter

00:34:00.839 --> 00:34:06.119
Caption: every Journey starts somewhere right our

00:34:03.418 --> 00:34:08.398
Caption: first pillar was purely this is a user

00:34:06.119 --> 00:34:10.739
Caption: based or user journey-based feature tree

00:34:08.398 --> 00:34:12.719
Caption: how do we access our experience what&#39;s

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:15.239
Caption: that entry point and we already said

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:17.280
Caption: there&#39;s existing portal our initial

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:18.598
Caption: release the minimum viable product hate

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:20.760
Caption: that word

00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:21.899
Caption: um is we&#39;re just pressing a button and

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.118
Caption: we&#39;re entering that experience and

00:34:21.898 --> 00:34:26.338
Caption: that&#39;s why it&#39;s at the top enter

00:34:24.118 --> 00:34:29.158
Caption: the next four like I mentioned that&#39;s

00:34:26.339 --> 00:34:30.780
Caption: engage so any user Journey again that

00:34:29.158 --> 00:34:32.459
Caption: you&#39;ll go through in life has these

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:33.780
Caption: characters engaged that&#39;s the core of it

00:34:32.459 --> 00:34:35.520
Caption: so you&#39;ll probably have quite a few

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.280
Caption: features in that if it&#39;s a form it&#39;s the

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:40.439
Caption: pages of the form if it&#39;s a leave

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.359
Caption: booking chatbot it&#39;s the approval stage

00:34:40.439 --> 00:34:44.819
Caption: Gates whatever you need like I&#39;ve

00:34:42.358 --> 00:34:46.858
Caption: already mentioned every feature that

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:49.139
Caption: exists has stories associated with it

00:34:46.858 --> 00:34:51.658
Caption: and then finally your confirmations your

00:34:49.138 --> 00:34:54.418
Caption: exits beginning middle end

00:34:51.658 --> 00:34:56.819
Caption: um and enter and guide X so those three

00:34:54.418 --> 00:34:58.439
Caption: is there the core so I like to think of

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:00.900
Caption: the exits as your planned and your

00:34:58.439 --> 00:35:03.000
Caption: unplanned successes and failures so

00:35:00.899 --> 00:35:04.739
Caption: what&#39;s your plan success oh that&#39;s just

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.080
Caption: a confirmation message you&#39;re getting

00:35:04.739 --> 00:35:08.760
Caption: almost all of your money back in seven

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:11.520
Caption: days awesome you get the text message

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.320
Caption: for reinsurance fantastic or the

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.179
Caption: unplanned failures could be your error

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.040
Caption: messages you need that to go live of

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:19.020
Caption: course day one but there&#39;s other cool

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.060
Caption: things later down the line office in

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.800
Caption: service design we find a little bit of

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.839
Caption: back of house manual stuff we&#39;re willing

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.400
Caption: to cope with to release this to test if

00:35:24.839 --> 00:35:28.320
Caption: people actually want to use it and over

00:35:26.399 --> 00:35:30.539
Caption: time we might invest in automating some

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.660
Caption: of that and that&#39;s where the book ends

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:35.880
Caption: come in and ties and extend don&#39;t like

00:35:33.659 --> 00:35:37.500
Caption: to start at entice an extent because

00:35:35.879 --> 00:35:39.598
Caption: that&#39;s usually when the big picture

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.399
Caption: thinkers get really excited what are all

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:43.440
Caption: the cool ways we can attract users to

00:35:41.399 --> 00:35:44.939
Caption: these features and extend what are all

00:35:43.439 --> 00:35:46.679
Caption: the ways that we can make a linear

00:35:44.939 --> 00:35:48.598
Caption: Journey or a product Journey circular

00:35:46.679 --> 00:35:51.179
Caption: and things like that don&#39;t start there

00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:53.400
Caption: but acknowledge that these are typically

00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:55.439
Caption: from my experience at least lower down

00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:57.479
Caption: the priority list when we&#39;re launching

00:35:55.439 --> 00:35:59.639
Caption: new functionality constantly

00:35:57.479 --> 00:36:01.739
Caption: re-prioritized but in ties how do we get

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:04.078
Caption: more users to that journey and extend

00:36:01.739 --> 00:36:05.879
Caption: now what do we want to automate more

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:06.780
Caption: what does this unlock that kind of

00:36:05.879 --> 00:36:08.279
Caption: thinking

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:11.400
Caption: so just

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:13.260
Caption: teaching by sheer repetition the five

00:36:11.399 --> 00:36:15.899
Caption: ease of service designs start in that

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.339
Caption: metal beginning middle and end then I

00:36:15.899 --> 00:36:20.338
Caption: would say answer those questions what

00:36:17.339 --> 00:36:22.739
Caption: comes before and what comes after so if

00:36:20.339 --> 00:36:25.500
Caption: we&#39;ve got a user Journey that is usually

00:36:22.739 --> 00:36:28.020
Caption: how we can look at our prototype

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:30.060
Caption: now cut slice that&#39;s where the knife

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.679
Caption: comes in slice the prototype in that

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.119
Caption: user Journey how does it answer that

00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:34.979
Caption: question and then we look at the

00:36:33.118 --> 00:36:36.118
Caption: experience and do the story breakdown

00:36:34.979 --> 00:36:37.919
Caption: from there

00:36:36.118 --> 00:36:39.479
Caption: so what we&#39;re looking at here like I&#39;ve

00:36:37.919 --> 00:36:41.159
Caption: mentioned already is at the beginning of

00:36:39.479 --> 00:36:42.959
Caption: a feature tree all of the smaller

00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:44.578
Caption: Post-it notes they&#39;re color coded for

00:36:42.959 --> 00:36:46.078
Caption: various reasons like still needs

00:36:44.579 --> 00:36:48.119
Caption: Discovery that&#39;s a different team that&#39;s

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:50.339
Caption: where we blocked by a platform but at

00:36:48.118 --> 00:36:52.019
Caption: the very least and this is the other way

00:36:50.339 --> 00:36:54.720
Caption: it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve tried this so

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:56.880
Caption: bonus cornalism for you why not road map

00:36:54.719 --> 00:36:58.439
Caption: it so we mapped out this is the core

00:36:56.879 --> 00:37:00.539
Caption: piece of functionality we&#39;re going to go

00:36:58.439 --> 00:37:02.760
Caption: live with day one what does the second

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.800
Caption: release look like you want more but yeah

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.599
Caption: second release or the phase after that

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.119
Caption: and where we discovered where is our

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:11.160
Caption: save for later bucket and that&#39;s how we

00:37:09.118 --> 00:37:13.260
Caption: use the feature tree to give that

00:37:11.159 --> 00:37:16.139
Caption: product vision and then we can create

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:18.179
Caption: the backlog from here and then we&#39;ve got

00:37:16.139 --> 00:37:20.219
Caption: structure in a backlog you can tag your

00:37:18.179 --> 00:37:22.500
Caption: backlog then with your feature Flags or

00:37:20.219 --> 00:37:24.540
Caption: things like that and color coded and

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:26.339
Caption: these artifacts will continue if you

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:28.560
Caption: update your feature tree they live

00:37:26.339 --> 00:37:29.880
Caption: together you update the feature tree you

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.500
Caption: update your backlog you update your

00:37:29.879 --> 00:37:34.679
Caption: backlog you update your feature tree so

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.479
Caption: in high periods of change pause the one

00:37:34.679 --> 00:37:38.040
Caption: definitely sort the house out the

00:37:36.479 --> 00:37:39.838
Caption: backlog out or sort the feature tree out

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.979
Caption: which one you&#39;re more dominant in and

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:42.839
Caption: then make sure that the other one

00:37:40.979 --> 00:37:44.459
Caption: reflects this change because then we can

00:37:42.839 --> 00:37:47.460
Caption: navigate between the two

00:37:44.459 --> 00:37:49.500
Caption: so I made you all a template so this is

00:37:47.459 --> 00:37:51.419
Caption: just a basic PowerPoint template a lot

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.040
Caption: of what you saw today is um just

00:37:51.419 --> 00:37:55.379
Caption: PowerPoint templates it&#39;s not overly

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:57.179
Caption: fancy so I&#39;ve created one hopefully this

00:37:55.379 --> 00:37:59.279
Caption: QR code still works from overnight I&#39;ve

00:37:57.179 --> 00:38:00.899
Caption: not tested it this morning and this QR

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.219
Caption: code is only going to be live today so

00:38:00.899 --> 00:38:05.098
Caption: shout out to the future if you&#39;re

00:38:02.219 --> 00:38:06.719
Caption: watching this it&#39;s not going to work so

00:38:05.099 --> 00:38:08.880
Caption: um I&#39;ll send you a couple of resources

00:38:06.719 --> 00:38:10.858
Caption: I&#39;ll send you that how to make one slide

00:38:08.879 --> 00:38:12.179
Caption: and if the five E&#39;s of service design in

00:38:10.858 --> 00:38:14.519
Caption: this PowerPoint

00:38:12.179 --> 00:38:15.838
Caption: um template that I&#39;ve made it&#39;s also on

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.060
Caption: the next slide so I&#39;m going to move on

00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:20.339
Caption: I&#39;ve I&#39;ve been given my five minute time

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:22.140
Caption: warning sorry if I went a bit over but

00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:24.480
Caption: at this point I might say thank you

00:38:22.139 --> 00:38:26.039
Caption: again for the 900th time and ask if

00:38:24.479 --> 00:38:28.020
Caption: you&#39;ve got any questions and hopefully

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.579
Caption: we can navigate that or I&#39;ll be probably

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:32.339
Caption: throughout today at the Telstra purple

00:38:29.579 --> 00:38:35.700
Caption: Booth if you want to have a chat so

00:38:32.339 --> 00:38:39.320
Caption: any questions any opportunities

00:38:35.699 --> 00:38:39.320
Caption: it&#39;s all good we&#39;ve got a question here

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:47.339
Caption: what is my favorite tool to work in for

00:38:44.399 --> 00:38:49.799
Caption: feature trees it really depends on the

00:38:47.339 --> 00:38:51.720
Caption: project Story Time the most recent

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.280
Caption: feature to you I&#39;ve created was in Excel

00:38:51.719 --> 00:38:55.919
Caption: because our product owner absolutely

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.739
Caption: loved Excel so it has the ability to

00:38:55.919 --> 00:39:00.780
Caption: filter and sort and give details and if

00:38:58.739 --> 00:39:03.179
Caption: you export a backlog so for example in

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.859
Caption: our case Azure devops it already is in a

00:39:03.179 --> 00:39:07.379
Caption: similar format so you can manipulate

00:39:04.858 --> 00:39:09.598
Caption: that CSV for that run reporting off of

00:39:07.379 --> 00:39:11.519
Caption: it it intimidates some team members

00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:13.380
Caption: because they&#39;re allergic to Excel and

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.959
Caption: that&#39;s okay so then at that point my

00:39:13.379 --> 00:39:17.939
Caption: experiences you make the trade-off I

00:39:15.959 --> 00:39:20.159
Caption: love the online whiteboarding tools I

00:39:17.939 --> 00:39:22.379
Caption: work from home so for me it&#39;s an easy

00:39:20.159 --> 00:39:24.539
Caption: place if you can convince someone to

00:39:22.379 --> 00:39:27.118
Caption: just go in and use it it&#39;s usually just

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.979
Caption: show me how you do it then they&#39;ll get

00:39:27.118 --> 00:39:30.239
Caption: into it and see how easy it is and if

00:39:28.979 --> 00:39:31.560
Caption: they&#39;re convinced that it&#39;s that easy

00:39:30.239 --> 00:39:32.760
Caption: then they will but if you tell them

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:35.339
Caption: you&#39;re going to use a new tool they

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.719
Caption: might be a bit antsy but luckily for us

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:39.239
Caption: I guess in our process it&#39;s already

00:39:36.719 --> 00:39:40.739
Caption: embedded that specific tool if you can

00:39:39.239 --> 00:39:42.839
Caption: work online but

00:39:40.739 --> 00:39:45.719
Caption: almost flipping the question don&#39;t let

00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:47.520
Caption: the tool block you so an Excel can be a

00:39:45.719 --> 00:39:48.959
Caption: bit oh sorry a PowerPoint can be quite

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.880
Caption: fidgety if you&#39;re moving a lot of

00:39:48.959 --> 00:39:53.879
Caption: grouped boxes around no one&#39;s favorite

00:39:50.879 --> 00:39:55.858
Caption: and choose an easy tool like a the

00:39:53.879 --> 00:39:59.338
Caption: mirrors of the world or they&#39;re quite

00:39:55.858 --> 00:40:00.419
Caption: easy I I find

00:39:59.339 --> 00:40:01.980
Caption: awesome

00:40:00.419 --> 00:40:03.239
Caption: there&#39;s a sorry I want to also mention

00:40:01.979 --> 00:40:05.280
Caption: on that no

00:40:03.239 --> 00:40:07.439
Caption: if you take an Excel spreadsheet and you

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.479
Caption: copy all the cells you have two windows

00:40:07.439 --> 00:40:11.219
Caption: and you drag the Excel cells over to

00:40:09.479 --> 00:40:13.199
Caption: mirror it just creates Post-it notes for

00:40:11.219 --> 00:40:14.399
Caption: you it&#39;s a wickedly fast feature you&#39;ll

00:40:13.199 --> 00:40:16.199
Caption: probably only believe it if you see it

00:40:14.399 --> 00:40:18.539
Caption: but it&#39;s that quick it&#39;s actually really

00:40:16.199 --> 00:40:20.159
Caption: cool so try it next time drag your

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.719
Caption: stories into these whiteboarding tools

00:40:20.159 --> 00:40:23.639
Caption: do you have time for one more question

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:26.520
Caption: for one more

00:40:23.639 --> 00:40:28.799
Caption: all good if not

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:31.140
Caption: there will be morning tea if there&#39;s no

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.479
Caption: more questions whether that influences

00:40:31.139 --> 00:40:36.179
Caption: your decision to ask

00:40:33.479 --> 00:40:38.459
Caption: awesome so that&#39;s me thanks first DDD

00:40:36.179 --> 00:40:39.780
Caption: talk down

00:40:38.459 --> 00:40:47.318
Caption: thank you everyone

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:47.319
Caption: [Applause]
