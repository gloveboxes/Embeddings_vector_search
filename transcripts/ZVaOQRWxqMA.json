  "description": "Stringly-typed code. It lurks inside quotation marks in source code, opaque to most to IDE tools, waiting for the unwary developer to rename or refactor something in their codebase. Everything builds and the app is deployed, only to throw runtime errors about references to non-existing HTTP endpoints, CSS classes, database tables, or asset files.\\n\\nIn this talk, we\u0027ll look at the dangers of stringly-typed code. We\u0027ll see how it saps confidence in code changes, making codebases brittle. We\u0027ll look for solutions to these issues, using TypeScript to turn opaque strings into well-checked values that can be refactored with confidence.\\n\\n--\\nTroy is a software engineer with broad industry experience, currently developing games at VGW. He also maintains and contributes to several open-source projects, and is a mentor at CoderDojo. Troy is interested in what makes software great, not just for the user, but also for the team maintaining it."
