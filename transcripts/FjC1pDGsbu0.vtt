WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.178
Caption: to be focused on today

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.159
Caption: and the one I&#39;m personally most

00:00:03.178 --> 00:00:06.539
Caption: passionate about is the system design

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:09.239
Caption: interview

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:11.300
Caption: so when we say certain design

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:14.039
Caption: a lot of people think we mean

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.319
Caption: architecture we&#39;re going to put up a

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:19.520
Caption: nice flow chart with you know database

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:19.520
Caption: here load balance here

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:23.819
Caption: and that&#39;s enough

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.920
Caption: there&#39;s actually a lot that goes into

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.180
Caption: certain design

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.979
Caption: and we&#39;re today we&#39;re going to walk

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.979
Caption: through a lot of these key Concepts

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.639
Caption: alongside that

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:37.020
Caption: we&#39;re also gonna go through the sponsors

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:38.459
Caption: which make a great conference like this

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.899
Caption: possible

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:42.479
Caption: so

00:00:39.898 --> 00:00:43.799
Caption: thank you very much for the uh sponsor

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.779
Caption: today who helped make all of this

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:47.939
Caption: possible

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:49.619
Caption: bit of a disclaimer I haven&#39;t worked at

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:51.119
Caption: Google myself

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:54.058
Caption: what I&#39;m going to be going through today

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:56.398
Caption: is based off my time and my experience

00:00:54.058 --> 00:00:58.799
Caption: going through a lot of these concepts

00:00:56.398 --> 00:01:02.218
Caption: with Google tech leads

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:05.099
Caption: and my own experience as an interviewer

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.599
Caption: this is the first time I&#39;ve done a DDD

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:09.360
Caption: talk so I&#39;m sure there&#39;s going to be

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:10.860
Caption: mistakes please bear with me

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.959
Caption: so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.459
Caption: today

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:15.720
Caption: there&#39;s going to be kind of three parts

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:17.279
Caption: of this story

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.619
Caption: the first thing

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:21.540
Caption: we&#39;re going to go through is what a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.780
Caption: interviewer is like

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.599
Caption: I assume well I assume some of you would

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:30.000
Caption: have done at least one interview

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:32.400
Caption: it&#39;s going to be going through kind of a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.158
Caption: common pitfalls people make in system

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.959
Caption: design to views

00:01:35.158 --> 00:01:39.360
Caption: we&#39;re then going to kind of distill that

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.339
Caption: down to I think the key point of the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.860
Caption: talk which is the

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:45.599
Caption: the big reason people kind of fall down

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.739
Caption: not just at these interviews but

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.139
Caption: actually day to day when you&#39;re

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:51.720
Caption: designing your own systems

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:52.978
Caption: from there we&#39;re going to move into a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.439
Caption: walk through

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:58.339
Caption: of how to really approach system design

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.340
Caption: in a structured way

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.220
Caption: I want to stress this isn&#39;t just going

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:03.899
Caption: to help you with interviews it really is

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.099
Caption: going to help you in your day-to-day

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.599
Caption: certain design

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.360
Caption: and I think if you&#39;re really paying

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:14.000
Caption: attention it&#39;s going to help mold how

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.000
Caption: you approach problem solving as well

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.720
Caption: so for our interview today we&#39;ve got our

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.580
Caption: main characters we&#39;ve got our

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.458
Caption: interviewer our system design

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.720
Caption: interviewer from tech company X

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:30.860
Caption: and us

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.860
Caption: the hopeful interviewee

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.220
Caption: so it&#39;s interview day

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:39.598
Caption: you&#39;re a bit nervous you&#39;re going to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.040
Caption: skip breakfast

00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:42.839
Caption: you&#39;re going to crack open your laptop

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:45.179
Caption: early in the morning and you&#39;re going to

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:47.160
Caption: check when your interview is

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:49.439
Caption: it&#39;s in about 15 minutes

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.760
Caption: you&#39;re going to want to join early don&#39;t

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.500
Caption: want to be late kind of make sure you

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:55.039
Caption: don&#39;t have any issues joining me tour

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.039
Caption: Zoom or whatever

00:02:56.098 --> 00:03:01.619
Caption: the interviewer signs on right on time

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.120
Caption: and introduces herself

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.139
Caption: she asks you to introduce yourself as

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.419
Caption: well

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.458
Caption: and you kind of chit chat back and forth

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.800
Caption: a little bit

00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:13.139
Caption: eventually she asks are you ready for

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.300
Caption: the actual interview

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.279
Caption: you say yes

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.339
Caption: she&#39;s then going to give you a prompt

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:22.919
Caption: what&#39;s the problem we&#39;re trying to solve

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:24.000
Caption: I want you to design a social media

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.979
Caption: application

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.539
Caption: where users can share messages with

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.800
Caption: their friends

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.878
Caption: so

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.878
Caption: think something like Twitter

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.699
Caption: luckily you&#39;re prepared for all this

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:38.039
Caption: you&#39;ve done systems designing your

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.179
Caption: day-to-day you&#39;ve done architecture

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:41.699
Caption: so

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:43.919
Caption: you end up with something like this

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.238
Caption: it&#39;s pretty standard looking I assume

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.220
Caption: most of you will have seen something

00:03:45.238 --> 00:03:48.839
Caption: similar to this

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.699
Caption: nothing wrong with this kind of Stack

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:53.039
Caption: you know you&#39;ve got a high availability

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:55.798
Caption: setup here you&#39;ve got a database

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:58.500
Caption: and you start a gas tester behind a CDN

00:03:55.798 --> 00:04:01.639
Caption: lots of best practice here

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.639
Caption: no big issues I think

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.940
Caption: can we handle more traffic

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:10.018
Caption: absolutely

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:12.298
Caption: sprinkle bit of cashing onto it

00:04:10.018 --> 00:04:13.979
Caption: sprinkle casing everywhere

00:04:12.298 --> 00:04:16.139
Caption: for those of you who haven&#39;t used red as

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:19.139
Caption: before it&#39;s an in-memory database that&#39;s

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.119
Caption: usually used as a cache so that sounds

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.759
Caption: good more performance

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:25.380
Caption: and I have seen all of these

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.399
Caption: configurations in my time as an

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.020
Caption: interviewer

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:29.820
Caption: we&#39;re going to add redis to absolutely

00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:31.259
Caption: everything

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.940
Caption: and I&#39;m going to talk a lot about

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:35.519
Caption: trade-offs today

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.320
Caption: but good thing is

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:38.879
Caption: everything&#39;s cached everything is going

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.440
Caption: to be way faster

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.080
Caption: one of the trails we make for this

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.059
Caption: performance is this is impossible

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:46.679
Caption: you can&#39;t do this

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:49.440
Caption: the only way you can connect redis up

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:50.519
Caption: here is to the service where it says

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.919
Caption: compute

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:56.039
Caption: sadly that&#39;s the least common way I&#39;ve

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.720
Caption: seen reddest attached

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.220
Caption: so

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.500
Caption: your interview is going to call this out

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.239
Caption: that&#39;s really interesting but I don&#39;t

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.639
Caption: think that&#39;s quite possible

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:06.959
Caption: what other options do we have what else

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.800
Caption: do we see quite commonly when we&#39;re

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:09.799
Caption: doing these interviews

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.660
Caption: we&#39;ll throw kubernetes at it I&#39;m not

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.459
Caption: entirely sure how that helps in any way

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.559
Caption: we&#39;re also going to go with cockroach at

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:21.660
Caption: it because it&#39;s new and because their

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:23.940
Caption: marketing team have done a fantastic job

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.179
Caption: it&#39;s like postgres but better in every

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.179
Caption: way

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.080
Caption: And I stress today we&#39;re really going to

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:33.839
Caption: talk a lot about

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:35.579
Caption: different approaches what the trade-offs

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.899
Caption: are and far far less about the

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:39.119
Caption: technology

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:40.619
Caption: one really common Pitfall is just

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:42.720
Caption: reading the front page of these

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:45.419
Caption: Technologies Dynamo is another one that

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.220
Caption: comes up you gigabyte Kafka whatever

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.660
Caption: they&#39;re going to pitch to you all these

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.639
Caption: great benefits

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.259
Caption: and they&#39;re going to say it&#39;s so

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.339
Caption: flexible it&#39;s useful in all of these

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:55.139
Caption: cases

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:57.179
Caption: you&#39;re really gonna have to dig for some

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.399
Caption: of those trade-offs

00:05:57.179 --> 00:06:01.019
Caption: if you don&#39;t understand this well if you

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:01.979
Caption: don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:03.299
Caption: solve

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.380
Caption: you&#39;re going to end up in a bit of hot

00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:06.720
Caption: water

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.100
Caption: you&#39;re going to end up with a

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.339
Caption: delayed

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.779
Caption: or incomplete solution

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:14.759
Caption: we haven&#39;t really gone through the

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.199
Caption: requirements so who knows what we&#39;re

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.559
Caption: really building

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.959
Caption: if we&#39;ve if we&#39;re going to have a

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:24.299
Caption: lot of back and forth of product

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:26.220
Caption: after we&#39;ve already already done a lot

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:28.138
Caption: of upfront design there&#39;s going to be

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.399
Caption: delays it&#39;s going to be oh but I thought

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.020
Caption: we were going to build it this way not

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:32.699
Caption: that way

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:34.138
Caption: if you don&#39;t talk to product at all

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.000
Caption: they&#39;re going to think you&#39;re building

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:37.319
Caption: one thing and you&#39;re going to have built

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.199
Caption: another thing

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.419
Caption: Your solution is going to be incomplete

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:45.239
Caption: it&#39;s also going to be expensive

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:47.279
Caption: you haven&#39;t really done much to look at

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:49.739
Caption: where your data is going look at what

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:50.940
Caption: compute you&#39;re going to need so you&#39;re

00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:52.259
Caption: going to end up throwing a lot of

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.299
Caption: hardware at it which is going to come at

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.580
Caption: a lot of cost

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:58.739
Caption: it&#39;s also going to be unreliable

00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:00.000
Caption: we&#39;ve put up design up there

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:01.440
Caption: but

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.720
Caption: how much throughput are we actually

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.580
Caption: trying to handle how much load

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.940
Caption: do we need does our system need to be

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:07.939
Caption: able to support

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:12.000
Caption: and of course it&#39;s going to be buggy as

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:13.799
Caption: well

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.739
Caption: especially if you&#39;re going to go with

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:18.720
Caption: those hot new databases with a lot of

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:21.179
Caption: eventual consistency well we&#39;re going to

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.639
Caption: go through that later

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:26.880
Caption: so your interview is very nice very

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:28.860
Caption: professional very polite she&#39;s gonna

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.539
Caption: let you down gently and just say I don&#39;t

00:07:28.859 --> 00:07:32.038
Caption: have any more questions

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:33.899
Caption: why should she

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:36.959
Caption: we haven&#39;t really demonstrated our

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:40.399
Caption: ability to explain our decisions so

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:40.399
Caption: she&#39;s going to save everyone time

00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:45.719
Caption: as I mentioned at the start

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:46.919
Caption: we&#39;ve made a few different mistakes here

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.259
Caption: but I&#39;m going to take a shot at

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:51.300
Caption: distilling it down into one

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:54.419
Caption: really

00:07:51.299 --> 00:07:56.638
Caption: what I think is a common cause

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:57.539
Caption: and giving it away a bit early but I

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:00.300
Caption: really think the mistake is

00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:02.519
Caption: unintentional design

00:08:00.299 --> 00:08:05.339
Caption: what I mean by that is we can get very

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:07.918
Caption: caught up in applying best practice

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:10.199
Caption: the best the newest technology the one

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:12.119
Caption: with the most performed at purported

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:14.160
Caption: benefits

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:16.500
Caption: the problem with that is when we&#39;re

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.839
Caption: asked to explain these decisions why do

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.239
Caption: we pick this and not something else

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:22.500
Caption: we might not be able to explain that

00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:24.479
Caption: and that&#39;s kind of what I mean by

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.619
Caption: unintentional if it was an intentional

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:27.959
Caption: design

00:08:25.619 --> 00:08:30.299
Caption: we&#39;d much better be able to say yes this

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:32.398
Caption: is why we chose it

00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:33.958
Caption: what we&#39;ve actually done is really

00:08:32.398 --> 00:08:36.239
Caption: sidestepped thinking about the problem

00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:38.458
Caption: and just gone for a lot of shortcut

00:08:36.239 --> 00:08:41.458
Caption: heuristics right which

00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:43.079
Caption: I think best practices can be sometimes

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:44.458
Caption: so let&#39;s try this whole process again

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.320
Caption: but this time we&#39;ll do it with a bit

00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:49.579
Caption: more intention

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.580
Caption: so let&#39;s wind back the clock

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:56.100
Caption: we or what is system design and I just

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.320
Caption: copied this straight from Wikipedia

00:08:56.099 --> 00:08:59.759
Caption: it&#39;s defined at the architecture well

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.320
Caption: we&#39;ve got a diagram so I guess we have

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.140
Caption: an architecture

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.660
Caption: we have product design

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.880
Caption: actually no we don&#39;t have product design

00:09:05.659 --> 00:09:10.319
Caption: modules interfaces data we ain&#39;t got

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.619
Caption: that we haven&#39;t really talked about it

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.539
Caption: we don&#39;t have requirements to start with

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:17.880
Caption: now the product design part is easy

00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:19.559
Caption: we&#39;re just going to blame product we&#39;ll

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:23.660
Caption: just Stonewall them off

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:23.659
Caption: divular solution and then fall over

00:09:24.359 --> 00:09:29.219
Caption: what we actually want to do is really

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.500
Caption: collaborate with our with product or

00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:33.619
Caption: your interviewer or just your team in

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.619
Caption: general

00:09:35.398 --> 00:09:38.119
Caption: I think

00:09:38.398 --> 00:09:42.719
Caption: this works both ways

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:44.159
Caption: product May some may simply throw

00:09:42.719 --> 00:09:46.259
Caption: requirements over the wall and not

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:48.239
Caption: really want questions so you can do this

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.160
Caption: one in Reverse as well you deliver a

00:09:48.239 --> 00:09:52.200
Caption: solution and blame engineering

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:54.059
Caption: if your company is particularly low on

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.260
Caption: funds you can blame each other much as

00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:57.479
Caption: you want while you&#39;re packing all your

00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:00.320
Caption: things into your boxes because

00:09:57.479 --> 00:10:00.320
Caption: um we fail to Launch

00:10:00.838 --> 00:10:04.440
Caption: so

00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:06.359
Caption: on to the walkthrough

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.039
Caption: how we&#39;re going to get ourselves out of

00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:10.919
Caption: this mess where we&#39;ve thrown together a

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:12.659
Caption: really unintentional design

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:14.940
Caption: the first place to start

00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:17.159
Caption: is function requirements

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.580
Caption: what are we actually trying to build

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:23.639
Caption: when we have a discussion with products

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.799
Caption: what are we going to talk about

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.940
Caption: uh we want to have a common

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:28.919
Caption: understanding of what we&#39;re trying to

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.359
Caption: build

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:32.219
Caption: so

00:10:30.359 --> 00:10:34.979
Caption: winding back the clock

00:10:32.219 --> 00:10:37.679
Caption: we want to talk about sorry we want to

00:10:34.979 --> 00:10:39.299
Caption: design a social media application where

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:40.440
Caption: users can share messages with their

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:41.880
Caption: friends

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.440
Caption: so

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.299
Caption: what&#39;s the what are the key features

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.380
Caption: what things do we need to provide so

00:10:45.299 --> 00:10:48.380
Caption: that customers can do that

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.820
Caption: the first thing

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.898
Caption: users do need to be able to post

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.359
Caption: messages

00:11:00.898 --> 00:11:05.640
Caption: that&#39;s an important one

00:11:03.359 --> 00:11:08.578
Caption: we also want to make sure that people

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.760
Caption: can share these messages with their

00:11:08.578 --> 00:11:10.760
Caption: friends

00:11:10.859 --> 00:11:14.700
Caption: how they&#39;re going to do that is by

00:11:12.299 --> 00:11:16.140
Caption: following each other

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.820
Caption: and we also want to make sure that

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.540
Caption: you&#39;ve got a nice feed of what all your

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.539
Caption: friends are saying

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.040
Caption: I think we can focus on these three

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.720
Caption: what I want to stress is that you don&#39;t

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:30.119
Caption: have to design every part of your

00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:32.819
Caption: application here

00:11:30.119 --> 00:11:35.578
Caption: you want to spend most of your time most

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:38.578
Caption: of your effort looking at areas or

00:11:35.578 --> 00:11:40.320
Caption: features where either your product has a

00:11:38.578 --> 00:11:41.578
Caption: lot of risk around it a lot of risk

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.140
Caption: around that feature

00:11:41.578 --> 00:11:45.599
Caption: or where you&#39;re really going to extract

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:48.239
Caption: a lot of competitive advantage

00:11:45.599 --> 00:11:50.159
Caption: and I think if we get these things right

00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:52.200
Caption: at the very least we do actually have a

00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:53.759
Caption: social media platform

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.859
Caption: so what about those things we left by

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.059
Caption: the side let&#39;s say authentication for

00:11:55.859 --> 00:11:59.338
Caption: example

00:11:57.059 --> 00:12:01.440
Caption: we can talk through that so for

00:11:59.338 --> 00:12:03.539
Caption: authentication there&#39;s a lot of nice

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.559
Caption: patterns for doing this I want to say

00:12:03.539 --> 00:12:06.559
Caption: it&#39;s a largely solved problem

00:12:07.619 --> 00:12:12.479
Caption: I&#39;m going to tell my interview with that

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.679
Caption: they&#39;re going to be okay with it and

00:12:12.479 --> 00:12:15.000
Caption: we&#39;re going to move on

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:18.059
Caption: if they&#39;re not okay with it of course

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.200
Caption: you can have a bit of a chat about it

00:12:18.059 --> 00:12:23.518
Caption: so we&#39;ve made some progress here

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.200
Caption: just by refining the function

00:12:23.518 --> 00:12:27.539
Caption: requirements we at least know what we&#39;re

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.500
Caption: going to build what our product is going

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:29.820
Caption: to look like

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.859
Caption: it&#39;s

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.000
Caption: there&#39;s less risk of your solution being

00:12:31.859 --> 00:12:34.200
Caption: delayed

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.099
Caption: or

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.100
Caption: incomplete

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.679
Caption: you still have all these other problems

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.220
Caption: though how are we going to deliver these

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:45.179
Caption: users cases to our to our users

00:12:44.219 --> 00:12:46.679
Caption: so we&#39;re going to move on to

00:12:45.179 --> 00:12:48.898
Caption: non-functional requirements the things

00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:50.219
Caption: that aren&#39;t features well we really need

00:12:48.898 --> 00:12:51.539
Caption: to think through

00:12:50.219 --> 00:12:53.898
Caption: and I think this is where it gets really

00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:53.898
Caption: interesting

00:12:56.458 --> 00:12:59.159
Caption: actually I will expand a bit more on

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.100
Caption: that

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:05.159
Caption: to be clear these are going to be things

00:13:02.099 --> 00:13:07.919
Caption: that our application needs to support

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:09.239
Caption: it just isn&#39;t a feature users aren&#39;t

00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:12.500
Caption: going to be too aware of it and you&#39;re

00:13:09.239 --> 00:13:12.500
Caption: not going to put it up on your website

00:13:12.778 --> 00:13:16.799
Caption: so

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.600
Caption: throughput

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:20.898
Caption: how much traffic does your site need to

00:13:18.599 --> 00:13:20.898
Caption: handle

00:13:21.479 --> 00:13:27.299
Caption: there&#39;s two major ways this gets split

00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:28.739
Caption: up read throughput so reading against

00:13:27.299 --> 00:13:30.838
Caption: your data stores reading against your

00:13:28.739 --> 00:13:33.838
Caption: services it&#39;s usually pretty easy to

00:13:30.838 --> 00:13:36.359
Caption: scale and scale horizontally too

00:13:33.838 --> 00:13:38.099
Caption: write the report is a lot tougher and

00:13:36.359 --> 00:13:41.219
Caption: comes a lot of trade-offs

00:13:38.099 --> 00:13:44.278
Caption: which we&#39;re going to discuss later

00:13:41.219 --> 00:13:46.439
Caption: so do we need to go away for a few weeks

00:13:44.278 --> 00:13:49.559
Caption: and talk to our data team and really get

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:52.200
Caption: an exact picture of how much traffic we

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:53.578
Caption: are handling how many users we have or

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.898
Caption: we haven&#39;t launched it how many users

00:13:53.578 --> 00:13:57.239
Caption: we&#39;re going to have

00:13:54.898 --> 00:13:58.559
Caption: not really we can be pretty rough about

00:13:57.239 --> 00:14:01.138
Caption: it we just want to get a rough picture

00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:02.820
Caption: of is it a lot of throughput is it a

00:14:01.138 --> 00:14:04.018
Caption: little bit of throughput

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.578
Caption: so we&#39;re gonna start with some napkin

00:14:04.018 --> 00:14:07.619
Caption: math

00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:09.958
Caption: a pretty standard prompt for this we can

00:14:07.619 --> 00:14:12.778
Caption: just ask hey how many users are we

00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:14.700
Caption: expecting to have

00:14:12.778 --> 00:14:16.500
Caption: we&#39;re going to get back a number and

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.419
Caption: this is something collaborate product or

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.458
Caption: if it&#39;s an interviewer they&#39;ll likely

00:14:18.419 --> 00:14:23.838
Caption: just hand it over to you let&#39;s just say

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:23.838
Caption: we have 100 million users

00:14:24.659 --> 00:14:28.018
Caption: from that we can start to build a

00:14:26.578 --> 00:14:30.179
Caption: picture we also need to know what

00:14:28.018 --> 00:14:32.099
Caption: they&#39;re going to do in a day right we

00:14:30.179 --> 00:14:33.778
Caption: want to know what is going to be hitting

00:14:32.099 --> 00:14:36.239
Caption: our services

00:14:33.778 --> 00:14:39.000
Caption: so

00:14:36.239 --> 00:14:41.398
Caption: we can kind of go with our gut fear here

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.219
Caption: we&#39;re going to say oh an average user is

00:14:41.398 --> 00:14:45.299
Caption: going to post up five messages a day uh

00:14:44.219 --> 00:14:46.259
Caption: they&#39;re going to follow one of their

00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:48.119
Caption: friends

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:53.220
Caption: and I&#39;m going to Doom scroll a little

00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:55.559
Caption: bit I have 20 views per user per day

00:14:53.219 --> 00:14:58.799
Caption: sure

00:14:55.559 --> 00:15:01.500
Caption: so we can start against some rough maths

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:03.659
Caption: if we have 100 million Daily Apple users

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.359
Caption: and we have five messages a day that&#39;s

00:15:03.659 --> 00:15:08.278
Caption: 500 million messages a day or about 6

00:15:06.359 --> 00:15:10.138
Caption: 000 requests a second

00:15:08.278 --> 00:15:12.838
Caption: if our users are following one other

00:15:10.138 --> 00:15:16.278
Caption: user a day 100 million follows a day

00:15:12.838 --> 00:15:16.278
Caption: 1200 requests a second

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.160
Caption: those are both right ones

00:15:18.299 --> 00:15:21.659
Caption: those are both right throughputs that&#39;s

00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:23.578
Caption: how many write requests we&#39;re going to

00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:26.278
Caption: need to handle

00:15:23.578 --> 00:15:28.320
Caption: look it&#39;s kind of around the mid-range

00:15:26.278 --> 00:15:30.539
Caption: the last one is reads

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.518
Caption: we&#39;re gonna have to do 2 billion

00:15:30.539 --> 00:15:34.979
Caption: reads a day

00:15:32.518 --> 00:15:37.619
Caption: 20

00:15:34.979 --> 00:15:40.078
Caption: feed 20 users requesting their feed

00:15:37.619 --> 00:15:42.419
Caption: every day

00:15:40.078 --> 00:15:44.760
Caption: per user per day

00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:45.958
Caption: it&#39;s a 24 000 requests read requests a

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.600
Caption: second

00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:50.219
Caption: it&#39;s getting up there

00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:51.539
Caption: we&#39;ll make a note of that I&#39;ll come back

00:15:50.219 --> 00:15:54.018
Caption: to that later that&#39;s going to help guide

00:15:51.539 --> 00:15:54.018
Caption: our design

00:15:55.619 --> 00:15:58.198
Caption: we also need to take stock of

00:15:57.059 --> 00:16:00.898
Caption: availability

00:15:58.198 --> 00:16:04.259
Caption: so availability is our system&#39;s ability

00:16:00.898 --> 00:16:06.059
Caption: to fulfill a functional requirement

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.799
Caption: it needs to succeed within a certain

00:16:06.059 --> 00:16:10.739
Caption: span of time

00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:13.559
Caption: why is that important

00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:15.898
Caption: if users on our app try to send a

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:18.059
Caption: message and they keep getting errors or

00:16:15.898 --> 00:16:20.338
Caption: it takes 30 seconds every time you post

00:16:18.059 --> 00:16:23.958
Caption: a message to get a confirmation it&#39;s

00:16:20.338 --> 00:16:23.958
Caption: going to be a pretty crummy experience

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:28.799
Caption: again

00:16:27.059 --> 00:16:30.898
Caption: and I&#39;m gonna Hammer this in so much

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:33.138
Caption: it&#39;s in collaboration with your product

00:16:30.898 --> 00:16:33.138
Caption: team

00:16:33.539 --> 00:16:37.578
Caption: well with with your wider team really

00:16:38.278 --> 00:16:41.398
Caption: we&#39;re going to say

00:16:39.719 --> 00:16:43.198
Caption: our users

00:16:41.398 --> 00:16:45.479
Caption: most of the time

00:16:43.198 --> 00:16:47.338
Caption: get a response within half a second when

00:16:45.479 --> 00:16:49.559
Caption: they try to send a message

00:16:47.338 --> 00:16:51.059
Caption: it feels about right again we can kind

00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:52.739
Caption: of use our gut as long as we&#39;re sending

00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:54.778
Caption: these products at these expectations

00:16:52.739 --> 00:16:56.458
Caption: with product

00:16:54.778 --> 00:16:59.039
Caption: we can follow another when we go to

00:16:56.458 --> 00:17:00.599
Caption: click follow on another user it succeeds

00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:02.820
Caption: most of the time within about two

00:17:00.599 --> 00:17:04.918
Caption: seconds

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.078
Caption: it&#39;s done less often and users will kind

00:17:04.918 --> 00:17:08.938
Caption: of just accept it that&#39;s what we think

00:17:07.078 --> 00:17:10.678
Caption: anyway we don&#39;t have to get it perfectly

00:17:08.938 --> 00:17:13.260
Caption: right we can always refine these things

00:17:10.678 --> 00:17:15.659
Caption: tune our solution after we launch as

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.880
Caption: long as we&#39;ve set our expectations with

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.280
Caption: product

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.958
Caption: the last one is really important for our

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.359
Caption: product

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:26.338
Caption: we want to encourage

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:29.280
Caption: why it&#39;s engagement right we really want

00:17:26.338 --> 00:17:31.020
Caption: users to get stuck in that Loop of just

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.179
Caption: scrolling and reviewing a lot of their

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:35.580
Caption: friends posts so that really needs to be

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:37.199
Caption: really quite reliable and happen pretty

00:17:35.579 --> 00:17:39.538
Caption: quickly you don&#39;t want them waiting or

00:17:37.199 --> 00:17:43.099
Caption: if they get an error screen

00:17:39.538 --> 00:17:43.099
Caption: they could very well leave right

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.558
Caption: we&#39;ll make a note of that and come back

00:17:47.579 --> 00:17:51.178
Caption: to that later

00:17:49.558 --> 00:17:52.199
Caption: consistency is a really interesting one

00:17:51.178 --> 00:17:55.140
Caption: as well

00:17:52.199 --> 00:17:56.459
Caption: consistency deals with guarantees

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.280
Caption: so

00:17:56.459 --> 00:18:02.880
Caption: what what are the characteristics of our

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.859
Caption: system when we write data and read data

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.020
Caption: back from it

00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:10.099
Caption: it&#39;s a whole huge topic all by itself

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.099
Caption: that I&#39;m not going to go into

00:18:10.199 --> 00:18:13.500
Caption: but

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.419
Caption: we can think we&#39;re going to use two

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.959
Caption: major models to categorize it for today

00:18:15.418 --> 00:18:22.439
Caption: we have strong consistency where all of

00:18:18.959 --> 00:18:25.079
Caption: your accesses are seen in sequence

00:18:22.439 --> 00:18:27.359
Caption: that maybe sounds a bit bubbly

00:18:25.079 --> 00:18:29.219
Caption: the important thing is this also means

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:31.439
Caption: when we write data to our stores or

00:18:29.219 --> 00:18:33.058
Caption: write down to our services as soon as we

00:18:31.439 --> 00:18:35.219
Caption: try to read it we&#39;re going to get the

00:18:33.058 --> 00:18:37.699
Caption: latest date back it&#39;s strongly

00:18:35.219 --> 00:18:37.699
Caption: consistent

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.359
Caption: on the other end of the scale and I

00:18:40.439 --> 00:18:44.459
Caption: promise we&#39;ll get something for this is

00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:46.500
Caption: eventual consistency

00:18:44.459 --> 00:18:49.798
Caption: so

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.298
Caption: with eventually consistent systems

00:18:49.798 --> 00:18:52.500
Caption: you&#39;re going to have all these updates

00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:55.619
Caption: coming in

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.178
Caption: but when you go to read at any time they

00:18:55.619 --> 00:18:59.880
Caption: might have said yeah we&#39;ve accepted this

00:18:57.178 --> 00:19:02.760
Caption: right we&#39;ve accepted this new data

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.619
Caption: but you might not get the latest data

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.579
Caption: the only guarantee this gives you is

00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:07.558
Caption: that

00:19:05.579 --> 00:19:10.760
Caption: if rights stop coming in we&#39;ll

00:19:07.558 --> 00:19:10.760
Caption: eventually get the latest date

00:19:11.038 --> 00:19:14.939
Caption: let&#39;s take an ordering out for example

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:18.059
Caption: Amazon or something

00:19:14.939 --> 00:19:20.159
Caption: when we go and order a new book

00:19:18.058 --> 00:19:22.439
Caption: with a strongly consistent system when

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.660
Caption: we got our order history we&#39;re going to

00:19:22.439 --> 00:19:27.418
Caption: see oh the new book we&#39;ve ordered

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:29.760
Caption: cool easy

00:19:27.418 --> 00:19:32.699
Caption: if we have an eventually consistent

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:35.400
Caption: backend what we might see is we purchase

00:19:32.699 --> 00:19:37.859
Caption: a book we go to the order history

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:40.200
Caption: and there&#39;s nothing there

00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:42.058
Caption: that sounds really bad in that case how

00:19:40.199 --> 00:19:44.479
Caption: can eventually eventual consistency be

00:19:42.058 --> 00:19:44.479
Caption: feasible

00:19:44.819 --> 00:19:47.639
Caption: there&#39;s actually a lot of ways around

00:19:46.199 --> 00:19:49.798
Caption: this

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.058
Caption: but most almost all of them will add

00:19:49.798 --> 00:19:53.159
Caption: complexity

00:19:51.058 --> 00:19:55.199
Caption: or otherwise impact the user flow for

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.700
Caption: example you might just say hey if you

00:19:55.199 --> 00:19:59.219
Caption: bought in the past 15 minutes it might

00:19:56.699 --> 00:20:00.779
Caption: not show up here

00:19:59.219 --> 00:20:02.038
Caption: you might also just choose to show a

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.539
Caption: spinner or something

00:20:02.038 --> 00:20:05.639
Caption: rather than

00:20:03.538 --> 00:20:07.319
Caption: show a stale state to put the customer

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.719
Caption: at ease

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:12.298
Caption: either way

00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:13.439
Caption: you&#39;re adding complexity application

00:20:12.298 --> 00:20:14.760
Caption: and

00:20:13.439 --> 00:20:16.379
Caption: I did promise we&#39;ll get something in

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.900
Caption: return

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.880
Caption: with strong consistency we get these

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.460
Caption: nice consistent views

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.798
Caption: it&#39;s very easy to use Easy to debug

00:20:23.459 --> 00:20:28.880
Caption: easier to reason about easier to write

00:20:25.798 --> 00:20:28.880
Caption: it&#39;s very nice

00:20:30.239 --> 00:20:34.798
Caption: one thing we can do

00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:37.558
Caption: with eventually consistent systems is

00:20:34.798 --> 00:20:39.178
Caption: really scale out our rights

00:20:37.558 --> 00:20:41.038
Caption: with a lot of these strongly consistent

00:20:39.178 --> 00:20:44.640
Caption: stores

00:20:41.038 --> 00:20:46.500
Caption: it&#39;s difficult to scale to descale these

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.178
Caption: rights horizontally we can&#39;t really have

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.979
Caption: a cluster of right nodes that&#39;s not how

00:20:48.178 --> 00:20:51.479
Caption: it works

00:20:49.979 --> 00:20:53.939
Caption: instead

00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:56.699
Caption: let&#39;s say we have our big SQL Server

00:20:53.939 --> 00:20:58.439
Caption: database all we can really do is scale

00:20:56.699 --> 00:21:00.719
Caption: it up and up and up

00:20:58.439 --> 00:21:02.219
Caption: you&#39;re going to hit limits there and

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:04.380
Caption: what you can

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:07.939
Caption: actually provide

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.940
Caption: and it&#39;s going to be awfully expensive

00:21:09.239 --> 00:21:14.038
Caption: with eventually consistent systems

00:21:12.178 --> 00:21:15.659
Caption: we&#39;re basically accepting hey I don&#39;t

00:21:14.038 --> 00:21:19.759
Caption: mind if this system returns a stale

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.760
Caption: result I&#39;d rather be more available

00:21:20.699 --> 00:21:26.399
Caption: this also means

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.260
Caption: we get a lot of

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.820
Caption: there&#39;s a lot of techniques that now

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.298
Caption: become available to us to improve right

00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:32.298
Caption: throughput

00:21:35.099 --> 00:21:40.038
Caption: a lot of those hinge on things like

00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:40.038
Caption: asynchronous replication

00:21:40.558 --> 00:21:47.699
Caption: making sure that we a

00:21:44.579 --> 00:21:49.739
Caption: you know a log of our transactions

00:21:47.699 --> 00:21:51.178
Caption: can be sensibly replicated to all of the

00:21:49.739 --> 00:21:53.099
Caption: other nodes in our cluster which are

00:21:51.178 --> 00:21:55.519
Caption: handling a little slice of our right

00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:55.520
Caption: throughput

00:21:56.099 --> 00:21:59.099
Caption: so that&#39;s consistency we&#39;ll actually

00:21:57.538 --> 00:22:00.418
Caption: come back a little bit on that when we

00:21:59.099 --> 00:22:04.280
Caption: go and talk about

00:22:00.418 --> 00:22:04.279
Caption: talk a little bit more about databases

00:22:04.439 --> 00:22:07.079
Caption: so how&#39;s it actually matter for

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.619
Caption: application

00:22:07.079 --> 00:22:13.619
Caption: is it okay if a users feed doesn&#39;t show

00:22:10.619 --> 00:22:15.479
Caption: a message that they&#39;ve just posted

00:22:13.619 --> 00:22:17.579
Caption: potentially

00:22:15.479 --> 00:22:18.959
Caption: it&#39;s not nice but we know we want to

00:22:17.579 --> 00:22:21.000
Caption: handle quite a bit of throughput here

00:22:18.959 --> 00:22:22.319
Caption: and for interest sake we&#39;re going to say

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.599
Caption: yeah we want to make that eventually

00:22:22.319 --> 00:22:27.798
Caption: consistent we&#39;ll accept a bit of

00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:27.798
Caption: complexity to our application

00:22:27.839 --> 00:22:33.178
Caption: with follows it&#39;s a bit more hazy if you

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.919
Caption: follow another user do you necessarily

00:22:33.178 --> 00:22:36.658
Caption: expect to see all their messages in your

00:22:34.918 --> 00:22:38.279
Caption: feed right away

00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:40.559
Caption: I think that&#39;s a bit more of a gray area

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.880
Caption: You could argue that hey if I&#39;m

00:22:40.558 --> 00:22:43.380
Caption: interested in what this person has to

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.298
Caption: say I want to get their messages right

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.819
Caption: now

00:22:45.298 --> 00:22:49.678
Caption: but there could also be a case made that

00:22:47.819 --> 00:22:51.178
Caption: we wanted to have that extra performance

00:22:49.678 --> 00:22:52.979
Caption: so we don&#39;t mind if it takes a little

00:22:51.178 --> 00:22:55.158
Caption: while for those friends messages to show

00:22:52.979 --> 00:22:55.158
Caption: up

00:22:56.339 --> 00:23:01.260
Caption: with viewing our feed

00:22:58.619 --> 00:23:03.538
Caption: I&#39;d argue it&#39;s much the other way

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:05.099
Caption: we can accept if one of your friends

00:23:03.538 --> 00:23:06.899
Caption: posts a new message

00:23:05.099 --> 00:23:08.699
Caption: you&#39;re not going to see it right away it

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.500
Caption: could be five ten seconds it could be a

00:23:08.699 --> 00:23:12.479
Caption: minute

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.538
Caption: again one of those things you really

00:23:12.479 --> 00:23:17.099
Caption: want to drive with product as long as

00:23:15.538 --> 00:23:19.699
Caption: the expectations are aligned I think are

00:23:17.099 --> 00:23:19.699
Caption: in a good place

00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:29.400
Caption: so let&#39;s discuss that with our friend

00:23:27.119 --> 00:23:31.859
Caption: our interviewer is it okay if the feed

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.659
Caption: sometimes out of date sure thing Andrew

00:23:31.859 --> 00:23:36.260
Caption: is very nice he just says yes to

00:23:33.659 --> 00:23:36.260
Caption: whatever we say

00:23:36.599 --> 00:23:40.140
Caption: the last one here a little bit more

00:23:38.939 --> 00:23:42.959
Caption: routine

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.640
Caption: where&#39;s this all this data where is all

00:23:42.959 --> 00:23:46.439
Caption: this user data going to go

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.419
Caption: if we&#39;ve got terabytes and terabytes and

00:23:46.439 --> 00:23:50.819
Caption: terabytes we need to store it somewhere

00:23:48.418 --> 00:23:52.500
Caption: we don&#39;t want to go and run out of

00:23:50.819 --> 00:23:55.979
Caption: disk spares in our database halfway

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:57.599
Caption: through or run out of some other store

00:23:55.979 --> 00:23:59.819
Caption: another one that we&#39;re not going to go

00:23:57.599 --> 00:24:01.979
Caption: too much into is the durability of your

00:23:59.819 --> 00:24:03.479
Caption: data don&#39;t always assume you need to

00:24:01.979 --> 00:24:05.699
Caption: store all of your data

00:24:03.479 --> 00:24:07.319
Caption: there&#39;s actually many cases where you&#39;re

00:24:05.699 --> 00:24:09.178
Caption: going to receive user data and you&#39;re

00:24:07.319 --> 00:24:10.798
Caption: either going to store it temporarily

00:24:09.178 --> 00:24:12.899
Caption: or you&#39;re going to store up somewhere

00:24:10.798 --> 00:24:14.880
Caption: transient you don&#39;t care if that machine

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:17.280
Caption: crashes and that data goes away it&#39;s

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.380
Caption: it&#39;s nice to have

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.659
Caption: so similar to what we did for throughput

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:25.339
Caption: let&#39;s do a little bit of napkin math

00:24:21.659 --> 00:24:25.340
Caption: to see how much data we need to store

00:24:25.439 --> 00:24:28.619
Caption: we&#39;re going to put up a little bit of a

00:24:27.178 --> 00:24:30.899
Caption: simple skimmer here I hope it&#39;s not too

00:24:28.619 --> 00:24:32.640
Caption: controversial just a unique identifier

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.799
Caption: for the message

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.299
Caption: when it was created will generate that

00:24:34.798 --> 00:24:37.918
Caption: server side

00:24:36.298 --> 00:24:39.658
Caption: a message

00:24:37.918 --> 00:24:41.339
Caption: and a little bit of metadata around it

00:24:39.659 --> 00:24:43.020
Caption: the metadata give us a bit of

00:24:41.339 --> 00:24:44.459
Caption: flexibility maybe we want to stuff

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.619
Caption: something in there later

00:24:44.459 --> 00:24:49.020
Caption: that&#39;s not the point the point is we&#39;ve

00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:51.239
Caption: got about 250 bytes of data here

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:54.419
Caption: per row

00:24:51.239 --> 00:24:56.579
Caption: we already know we&#39;ve we&#39;ve done the

00:24:54.418 --> 00:24:58.918
Caption: we&#39;ve gone asked how many users we have

00:24:56.579 --> 00:25:01.519
Caption: how many messages we expect users to

00:24:58.918 --> 00:25:01.519
Caption: post each day

00:25:01.619 --> 00:25:05.699
Caption: and I hope my math is right here that

00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:08.219
Caption: should be 125 gigs a day

00:25:05.699 --> 00:25:10.439
Caption: or 40 terabytes a year

00:25:08.219 --> 00:25:13.020
Caption: this does matter

00:25:10.439 --> 00:25:14.158
Caption: I use postgres Aurora a lot my

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.919
Caption: day-to-day

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:18.480
Caption: that has a database name of 128

00:25:16.918 --> 00:25:20.759
Caption: terabytes

00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:22.619
Caption: that means within a few years we&#39;re

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.178
Caption: going to start to have to eat this we&#39;re

00:25:22.619 --> 00:25:26.400
Caption: going to get stuff we&#39;re going to have

00:25:24.178 --> 00:25:28.619
Caption: to start deleting data

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.580
Caption: or we can have a look at an archiving

00:25:28.619 --> 00:25:31.579
Caption: process up front

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:37.678
Caption: on the other hand be careful other

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:40.320
Caption: limits as well we just ran to a problem

00:25:37.678 --> 00:25:41.939
Caption: where one of our tables is starting to

00:25:40.319 --> 00:25:44.459
Caption: exceed it&#39;s it&#39;s getting really close to

00:25:41.939 --> 00:25:46.500
Caption: its limit projects has a limit of 32

00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:49.399
Caption: terabytes

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.400
Caption: know your technology

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:53.839
Caption: so

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:57.900
Caption: now that we&#39;ve gone through what are

00:25:56.038 --> 00:25:59.639
Caption: abnis has poured both from a functional

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.739
Caption: and non-functional sense

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:05.039
Caption: we&#39;re going to go with something uh

00:26:01.739 --> 00:26:06.778
Caption: a tiny bit more esoteric

00:26:05.038 --> 00:26:08.219
Caption: is the schema

00:26:06.779 --> 00:26:11.419
Caption: how are we going to send this

00:26:08.219 --> 00:26:11.418
Caption: information around our system

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.479
Caption: we don&#39;t need to talk about it in too

00:26:13.739 --> 00:26:18.839
Caption: much detail just enough for us to reason

00:26:15.479 --> 00:26:21.058
Caption: about the parts of our system

00:26:18.839 --> 00:26:23.219
Caption: remember our three use cases

00:26:21.058 --> 00:26:26.520
Caption: want to be able to post a message

00:26:23.219 --> 00:26:29.778
Caption: we want to be able to follow other users

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.779
Caption: and we want to be able to view

00:26:29.819 --> 00:26:33.538
Caption: other uses feeds

00:26:32.219 --> 00:26:35.339
Caption: you can see this is missing a whole

00:26:33.538 --> 00:26:37.079
Caption: bunch of stuff but we&#39;ve got the key

00:26:35.339 --> 00:26:39.298
Caption: points here you want to post a message

00:26:37.079 --> 00:26:42.359
Caption: include your message and I&#39;ll follow

00:26:39.298 --> 00:26:44.278
Caption: user you include the user ID

00:26:42.359 --> 00:26:46.260
Caption: you want to view the feed you&#39;re going

00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:47.580
Caption: to just send a request and you&#39;re

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.940
Caption: hopefully going to get back a big list

00:26:47.579 --> 00:26:49.939
Caption: of messages

00:26:51.719 --> 00:26:55.979
Caption: the last part

00:26:54.359 --> 00:26:57.778
Caption: ties it all together but I think it&#39;s

00:26:55.979 --> 00:27:00.418
Caption: actually the probably the least juicy

00:26:57.779 --> 00:27:03.299
Caption: part so if we go back to the very

00:27:00.418 --> 00:27:05.939
Caption: standard looking stack we had before

00:27:03.298 --> 00:27:08.880
Caption: how are we actually going to talk to

00:27:05.939 --> 00:27:10.739
Caption: our services from our client I think we

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.199
Caption: what I&#39;ve seen a lot is people are going

00:27:10.739 --> 00:27:16.140
Caption: to generate default to rest

00:27:13.199 --> 00:27:18.599
Caption: and that&#39;s what I really want to

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.520
Caption: hammer down on or push back on

00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:22.439
Caption: we don&#39;t want to be in the habit of

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.700
Caption: defaulting to certain Technologies and

00:27:22.439 --> 00:27:25.139
Caption: it&#39;s our Instinct because we develop

00:27:23.699 --> 00:27:27.899
Caption: expertise with these specific

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:30.719
Caption: Technologies same with our database

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.099
Caption: a lot of time a lot of time it&#39;s okay

00:27:30.719 --> 00:27:34.079
Caption: but I&#39;d like us to be a bit more

00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:35.880
Caption: intentional about how we design these

00:27:34.079 --> 00:27:37.678
Caption: instead instead of saying we&#39;ll just use

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:41.058
Caption: SQL Server because we have that we have

00:27:37.678 --> 00:27:41.058
Caption: that there I know how to use it

00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:45.900
Caption: a quick overview of some of the other

00:27:43.918 --> 00:27:48.119
Caption: things out there that aren&#39;t rest I&#39;m

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:51.659
Caption: not going to go too much into rest I

00:27:48.119 --> 00:27:54.658
Caption: think most of us are pretty aware of

00:27:51.659 --> 00:27:56.340
Caption: how to use a user a lot now day to day

00:27:54.659 --> 00:27:58.679
Caption: it&#39;s mature

00:27:56.339 --> 00:28:01.439
Caption: it&#39;s battle tested

00:27:58.678 --> 00:28:03.538
Caption: Acacia is really nicely too

00:28:01.439 --> 00:28:05.538
Caption: but what about the other stuff

00:28:03.538 --> 00:28:08.219
Caption: should we hop straight to graphql

00:28:05.538 --> 00:28:10.019
Caption: graphql is really cool right we can do a

00:28:08.219 --> 00:28:11.579
Caption: declarative query instead of have it

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.700
Caption: being beholden to different endpoints we

00:28:11.579 --> 00:28:17.038
Caption: can say hey I just want this data

00:28:14.699 --> 00:28:19.979
Caption: I want to get you know these messages

00:28:17.038 --> 00:28:22.558
Caption: and

00:28:19.979 --> 00:28:25.439
Caption: from these users it&#39;s really nice for

00:28:22.558 --> 00:28:27.000
Caption: the front-end teams also cuts a bit cuts

00:28:25.439 --> 00:28:28.439
Caption: down a bit on how much dead we need to

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.699
Caption: fetch with your rest endpoints you

00:28:28.439 --> 00:28:32.038
Caption: generally get the whole resource back

00:28:29.699 --> 00:28:34.519
Caption: with graph you&#39;re only going to get what

00:28:32.038 --> 00:28:34.519
Caption: you asked for

00:28:35.159 --> 00:28:38.159
Caption: grpc

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:42.659
Caption: it&#39;s fancy

00:28:39.839 --> 00:28:44.459
Caption: super fast to deserialize and serialize

00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:47.640
Caption: data because it&#39;s just going to send

00:28:44.459 --> 00:28:49.739
Caption: binary representations Over The Wire

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.779
Caption: why don&#39;t we just use that instead

00:28:49.739 --> 00:28:54.178
Caption: well browsers don&#39;t have very good

00:28:51.779 --> 00:28:55.200
Caption: support for it so if you want to use it

00:28:54.178 --> 00:28:58.619
Caption: for

00:28:55.199 --> 00:29:00.959
Caption: users to send requests to your server

00:28:58.619 --> 00:29:03.479
Caption: you&#39;re going to need a proxy in between

00:29:00.959 --> 00:29:05.339
Caption: so adding complexity there it is however

00:29:03.479 --> 00:29:06.538
Caption: very very nice for server to server

00:29:05.339 --> 00:29:08.819
Caption: comes

00:29:06.538 --> 00:29:11.399
Caption: there&#39;s Traders with that

00:29:08.819 --> 00:29:12.418
Caption: but if you have massive scale these

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.339
Caption: these are things that are going to save

00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:17.839
Caption: you a whole lot of money really going to

00:29:14.339 --> 00:29:17.839
Caption: cut down on how much compute you need

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.339
Caption: I promise to talk a little about

00:29:22.079 --> 00:29:25.979
Caption: databases

00:29:23.339 --> 00:29:27.599
Caption: where we&#39;re going to put our data

00:29:25.979 --> 00:29:29.760
Caption: a lot of the time we&#39;re going to default

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:31.319
Caption: to the one of these right

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.119
Caption: we&#39;re going to default to postgres I

00:29:31.319 --> 00:29:35.719
Caption: love postgres I love SQL Server I love

00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:35.719
Caption: MySQL

00:29:35.819 --> 00:29:40.500
Caption: these have a three things in common that

00:29:37.979 --> 00:29:42.359
Caption: run off a relational model a model

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.399
Caption: and they&#39;re going to generally have one

00:29:42.359 --> 00:29:45.658
Caption: writer node and support for read

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:48.179
Caption: replicas and I know there&#39;s plugins

00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:51.679
Caption: which let you do may let you do more

00:29:48.178 --> 00:29:51.678
Caption: replicationally shining around that

00:29:52.439 --> 00:29:56.519
Caption: generally

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.200
Caption: I think all of these are going to be

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.640
Caption: strongly consistent they just have that

00:29:58.199 --> 00:30:02.219
Caption: one writer node

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.140
Caption: if is in a case where I can&#39;t send you

00:30:02.219 --> 00:30:06.898
Caption: up-to-date data it&#39;s going to fail

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.700
Caption: instead the system will become

00:30:06.899 --> 00:30:10.440
Caption: unavailable and you&#39;re going to get

00:30:08.699 --> 00:30:12.778
Caption: nothing

00:30:10.439 --> 00:30:15.000
Caption: the benefit of this is of course is much

00:30:12.779 --> 00:30:17.399
Caption: easier

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.418
Caption: to design your applications you you

00:30:17.399 --> 00:30:19.919
Caption: don&#39;t have to deal with a lot of that

00:30:18.418 --> 00:30:21.658
Caption: eventual consistency

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:23.759
Caption: which you&#39;re going to have to deal with

00:30:21.659 --> 00:30:27.080
Caption: a lot in

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.079
Caption: nosql databases

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:31.440
Caption: a lot of these will

00:30:29.339 --> 00:30:32.939
Caption: say they provide strongly consistent

00:30:31.439 --> 00:30:34.439
Caption: reads

00:30:32.939 --> 00:30:37.439
Caption: but there&#39;s going to be a lot of

00:30:34.439 --> 00:30:39.719
Caption: asterisks around that

00:30:37.439 --> 00:30:42.199
Caption: once we release ourselves from that

00:30:39.719 --> 00:30:42.199
Caption: requirement

00:30:42.298 --> 00:30:47.519
Caption: to have always up-to-date information

00:30:44.939 --> 00:30:49.798
Caption: like I said before a lot of techno a lot

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:52.080
Caption: of techniques become available to you to

00:30:49.798 --> 00:30:53.880
Caption: support more availability and more

00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:55.558
Caption: throughput even semantically you&#39;re

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.479
Caption: going to get more availability simply

00:30:55.558 --> 00:31:00.839
Caption: because the system will say it&#39;s finer

00:30:57.479 --> 00:31:03.239
Caption: I&#39;m out of date here&#39;s your data

00:31:00.839 --> 00:31:04.739
Caption: so that&#39;s that big trade-off

00:31:03.239 --> 00:31:06.359
Caption: are you willing to accept eventual

00:31:04.739 --> 00:31:07.439
Caption: consistency

00:31:06.359 --> 00:31:10.880
Caption: if you&#39;re going to get a lot of

00:31:07.439 --> 00:31:10.879
Caption: throughpoint availability out of it

00:31:10.979 --> 00:31:14.699
Caption: there are ways you&#39;re going to get more

00:31:13.199 --> 00:31:16.319
Caption: complexity in your system and your

00:31:14.699 --> 00:31:19.439
Caption: applications

00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:21.859
Caption: or you&#39;re going to affect the user flow

00:31:19.439 --> 00:31:21.859
Caption: in some way

00:31:24.959 --> 00:31:28.260
Caption: we also want to talk about

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.239
Caption: data flows

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:33.479
Caption: so how

00:31:30.239 --> 00:31:35.520
Caption: data flows through our system

00:31:33.479 --> 00:31:37.140
Caption: now that we&#39;ve got our bit of our schema

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.159
Caption: we can have a think about okay these

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.159
Caption: requests are coming in

00:31:40.199 --> 00:31:45.239
Caption: can we do some pre-computation so that

00:31:42.719 --> 00:31:48.058
Caption: when the user goes to fetch a certain

00:31:45.239 --> 00:31:51.599
Caption: piece of data it&#39;s already there hot in

00:31:48.058 --> 00:31:53.219
Caption: the case or in a service somewhere

00:31:51.599 --> 00:31:54.898
Caption: as a little bit of Flip Side you have

00:31:53.219 --> 00:31:56.880
Caption: caching

00:31:54.899 --> 00:31:58.619
Caption: once you&#39;ve done a bit of work to

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.359
Caption: compute something maybe someone&#39;s feed

00:31:58.619 --> 00:32:01.979
Caption: or something like that

00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:03.359
Caption: why not just save it somewhere so if

00:32:01.979 --> 00:32:04.798
Caption: they ask again for it we can bring it

00:32:03.359 --> 00:32:07.558
Caption: back quickly we don&#39;t have to do all

00:32:04.798 --> 00:32:10.439
Caption: that work of looking up

00:32:07.558 --> 00:32:14.038
Caption: who you know who are their friends

00:32:10.439 --> 00:32:15.538
Caption: what messages have their friends sent to

00:32:14.038 --> 00:32:17.898
Caption: build up that picture every time it&#39;s a

00:32:15.538 --> 00:32:17.898
Caption: lot of work

00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:23.640
Caption: there&#39;s concerns around this as well

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:25.319
Caption: your caching layer can fail

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.579
Caption: you don&#39;t want your application to come

00:32:25.319 --> 00:32:28.678
Caption: unavailable so there&#39;s there&#39;s

00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:30.538
Caption: complexity here again

00:32:28.678 --> 00:32:33.558
Caption: for performance

00:32:30.538 --> 00:32:33.558
Caption: it&#39;s common theme right

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:38.640
Caption: so I&#39;m actually going to give you

00:32:36.178 --> 00:32:40.798
Caption: something that&#39;s not particularly it&#39;s

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.119
Caption: not a perfect architecture or even a

00:32:40.798 --> 00:32:45.298
Caption: great architecture

00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:46.739
Caption: but it&#39;s something that I can back up is

00:32:45.298 --> 00:32:49.500
Caption: something where if you ask me questions

00:32:46.739 --> 00:32:51.298
Caption: about it I can at least give you some

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.219
Caption: amount of explanation about why I&#39;ve

00:32:51.298 --> 00:32:56.459
Caption: done things a certain way

00:32:53.219 --> 00:32:58.979
Caption: I&#39;ve cut out the static assets part

00:32:56.459 --> 00:33:01.199
Caption: that&#39;s a bit less interesting

00:32:58.979 --> 00:33:03.719
Caption: we&#39;ve got our three main requests

00:33:01.199 --> 00:33:06.239
Caption: posting a message

00:33:03.719 --> 00:33:08.099
Caption: following another user

00:33:06.239 --> 00:33:10.619
Caption: and getting a feedback of what our

00:33:08.099 --> 00:33:12.778
Caption: friends have said

00:33:10.619 --> 00:33:15.239
Caption: so

00:33:12.779 --> 00:33:17.700
Caption: going back to talking about

00:33:15.239 --> 00:33:20.099
Caption: picking the right technology

00:33:17.699 --> 00:33:22.278
Caption: and I&#39;ll add some caveats into this

00:33:20.099 --> 00:33:22.278
Caption: later

00:33:22.558 --> 00:33:28.678
Caption: we&#39;ve put in a graph DB for our so uh

00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:30.899
Caption: for our social graph service

00:33:28.678 --> 00:33:36.119
Caption: we&#39;ve got something optimized to help us

00:33:30.899 --> 00:33:38.340
Caption: get a list of friends faster and user

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:39.839
Caption: graph databases are pretty cool they

00:33:38.339 --> 00:33:42.479
Caption: store relationships as a first class

00:33:39.839 --> 00:33:44.298
Caption: thing not the element themselves

00:33:42.479 --> 00:33:47.699
Caption: that means when you&#39;re looking for

00:33:44.298 --> 00:33:49.319
Caption: relationships based off a certain node

00:33:47.699 --> 00:33:51.429
Caption: it&#39;s going to be much faster than doing

00:33:49.319 --> 00:33:53.219
Caption: the same on a relational database

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:54.779
Caption: [Music]

00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:56.158
Caption: and a lot a lot of these are eventually

00:33:54.779 --> 00:33:57.720
Caption: consistent

00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:59.039
Caption: but as we said before we&#39;re going to go

00:33:57.719 --> 00:34:01.018
Caption: accept that we&#39;ve discussed that with

00:33:59.038 --> 00:34:02.278
Caption: product it&#39;s it&#39;s okay you&#39;re not going

00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:04.880
Caption: to get your friend&#39;s latest messages

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:04.880
Caption: right away

00:34:05.459 --> 00:34:09.658
Caption: similar when we post a message so we can

00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:10.979
Caption: do a bit of pre-computation here we

00:34:09.658 --> 00:34:12.658
Caption: don&#39;t want to lose these messages that

00:34:10.979 --> 00:34:15.239
Caption: would be bad if everyone just you know

00:34:12.658 --> 00:34:17.219
Caption: you post all these messages and you want

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:18.118
Caption: to see them later reminisce about what

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:19.560
Caption: you and your friends have been talking

00:34:18.118 --> 00:34:21.539
Caption: about so we&#39;ll

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:25.639
Caption: put a database up there somewhere

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:25.639
Caption: could be postgres could be

00:34:25.678 --> 00:34:28.459
Caption: they both work

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:33.060
Caption: but we&#39;re also going to send something

00:34:29.939 --> 00:34:35.098
Caption: to an asynchronous worker a feed updater

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:38.760
Caption: so when we know that a message has come

00:34:35.099 --> 00:34:40.919
Caption: in we&#39;re going to go up and update

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.780
Caption: your people who are following you we&#39;re

00:34:40.918 --> 00:34:45.678
Caption: going to inject this new message into

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.678
Caption: all of those feeds

00:34:46.439 --> 00:34:50.158
Caption: that means

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:52.619
Caption: if we&#39;ve done a good job keeping our

00:34:50.158 --> 00:34:53.939
Caption: caching layer consistent when requests

00:34:52.618 --> 00:34:55.739
Caption: come in

00:34:53.939 --> 00:34:56.939
Caption: a lot of users especially for the active

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:59.520
Caption: users you&#39;re going to get your feed

00:34:56.939 --> 00:35:01.319
Caption: right away our service hat can do a

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:04.760
Caption: whole lot less work in

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.760
Caption: generating users feeds

00:35:06.719 --> 00:35:12.300
Caption: so

00:35:09.239 --> 00:35:14.219
Caption: it&#39;s in considering things like that

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.500
Caption: I think we get a lot of value

00:35:14.219 --> 00:35:18.118
Caption: you can explain your decisions

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:21.439
Caption: you&#39;re explaining why using something

00:35:18.118 --> 00:35:21.439
Caption: and not something else

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:26.839
Caption: you&#39;re picking the right technology

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.540
Caption: there&#39;s next steps there&#39;s things I

00:35:32.099 --> 00:35:36.079
Caption: haven&#39;t covered

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.079
Caption: so

00:35:36.239 --> 00:35:38.879
Caption: moving forwards doing a bit better than

00:35:37.858 --> 00:35:40.379
Caption: this

00:35:38.879 --> 00:35:42.779
Caption: you want to find ways where you can deal

00:35:40.379 --> 00:35:44.759
Caption: with less data

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.939
Caption: and that&#39;s where we kind of talked about

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.919
Caption: can we pre-compute something

00:35:47.939 --> 00:35:51.540
Caption: can we case something just so we have

00:35:49.919 --> 00:35:53.699
Caption: less

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:57.320
Caption: data that needs to be computed on the

00:35:53.699 --> 00:35:57.320
Caption: Fly Center here and there

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:04.560
Caption: picking the right tool

00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:08.098
Caption: so really reasoning about what

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:10.260
Caption: I&#39;m using this technology because this

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:11.339
Caption: I know it&#39;s got these cons but that&#39;s

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.839
Caption: okay

00:36:11.339 --> 00:36:15.079
Caption: and we&#39;re all in love with product about

00:36:12.839 --> 00:36:15.079
Caption: that

00:36:15.358 --> 00:36:20.358
Caption: I&#39;ve also haven&#39;t talked about some of

00:36:17.879 --> 00:36:20.358
Caption: the more

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.300
Caption: um

00:36:21.659 --> 00:36:27.059
Caption: for example sharding it&#39;s going to

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:28.699
Caption: improve your right throughput but

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:31.619
Caption: that&#39;s kind of a whole Topic in itself

00:36:28.699 --> 00:36:33.179
Caption: there&#39;s more complexity there how are

00:36:31.618 --> 00:36:35.699
Caption: you going to split your data up among

00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:38.459
Caption: different shards things like that

00:36:35.699 --> 00:36:39.598
Caption: few edge cases as well

00:36:38.459 --> 00:36:41.280
Caption: like

00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:45.180
Caption: sorry

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:47.099
Caption: while our solution works well for

00:36:45.179 --> 00:36:49.459
Caption: cases where users don&#39;t have a lot of

00:36:47.099 --> 00:36:49.460
Caption: followers

00:36:49.919 --> 00:36:53.639
Caption: because that little async worker is

00:36:51.719 --> 00:36:56.040
Caption: going to go and update people&#39;s feeds

00:36:53.639 --> 00:36:58.078
Caption: if we have Lady Gaga come in with a 30

00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:01.020
Caption: million followers and post a message

00:36:58.079 --> 00:37:02.640
Caption: that&#39;s going to be massive ride volume

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:05.239
Caption: these are the kind of edge cases that

00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:05.239
Caption: you want to think about

00:37:06.419 --> 00:37:12.118
Caption: there&#39;s a cautionary tale here as well

00:37:09.959 --> 00:37:13.379
Caption: you don&#39;t want to be when you&#39;re picking

00:37:12.118 --> 00:37:15.059
Caption: the right tool

00:37:13.379 --> 00:37:16.199
Caption: you also want to think about your team&#39;s

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.640
Caption: skill set

00:37:16.199 --> 00:37:20.159
Caption: there&#39;s

00:37:17.639 --> 00:37:22.919
Caption: not much reason to adapt a technology

00:37:20.159 --> 00:37:24.118
Caption: there&#39;s a few ways you can approach it

00:37:22.919 --> 00:37:25.858
Caption: either

00:37:24.118 --> 00:37:29.578
Caption: you

00:37:25.858 --> 00:37:33.299
Caption: tend to shy away from using a technology

00:37:29.579 --> 00:37:34.440
Caption: that your team doesn&#39;t know how to use

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.260
Caption: or that you think you&#39;re going to have

00:37:34.439 --> 00:37:39.479
Caption: difficulty hiring for

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:42.479
Caption: another way and this takes a lot of

00:37:39.479 --> 00:37:44.399
Caption: effort is to drive consensus

00:37:42.479 --> 00:37:46.919
Caption: among your wider engineering team about

00:37:44.399 --> 00:37:49.919
Caption: adopting a technology because it allows

00:37:46.919 --> 00:37:52.260
Caption: us to do XYZ and I can&#39;t stress how much

00:37:49.919 --> 00:37:56.399
Caption: effort and how exhausting that can be

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.399
Caption: even in the best run organizations

00:37:56.459 --> 00:37:59.699
Caption: you&#39;ll want to look at procurement as

00:37:57.959 --> 00:38:00.780
Caption: well there&#39;s going to be a lot of people

00:37:59.699 --> 00:38:02.578
Caption: in the company who are going to be

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:05.339
Caption: pretty unhappy if you&#39;re like I want to

00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:07.800
Caption: grab this technology uh

00:38:05.339 --> 00:38:09.839
Caption: going to grab you know cockroach here

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:12.540
Caption: and I like this from AWS and I like this

00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:15.180
Caption: from Azure and I like this from gcp

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:16.260
Caption: it&#39;s going to be a real headache there&#39;s

00:38:15.179 --> 00:38:19.319
Caption: contracts here that need to be

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:21.179
Caption: negotiated there&#39;s money

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.060
Caption: it&#39;s a lot work more work than it might

00:38:21.179 --> 00:38:26.040
Caption: appear at first thought

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.719
Caption: and there&#39;s always you aren&#39;t going to

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.900
Caption: need it

00:38:27.719 --> 00:38:32.639
Caption: I think we have a natural tendency to

00:38:30.899 --> 00:38:36.919
Caption: want to avoid

00:38:32.639 --> 00:38:36.919
Caption: maybe future uncertainty or future risk

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.380
Caption: so

00:38:38.699 --> 00:38:41.399
Caption: we can end up over engineering our

00:38:40.379 --> 00:38:43.559
Caption: systems

00:38:41.399 --> 00:38:46.199
Caption: we&#39;ll put this big eventually consistent

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:48.599
Caption: system in place

00:38:46.199 --> 00:38:50.338
Caption: and spend a lot more time

00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:52.920
Caption: working around the complexities of that

00:38:50.339 --> 00:38:55.380
Caption: then building out our core system

00:38:52.919 --> 00:38:57.239
Caption: so please please please there&#39;s a lot of

00:38:55.379 --> 00:38:58.919
Caption: you aren&#39;t going to need it

00:38:57.239 --> 00:39:00.358
Caption: you can apply here

00:38:58.919 --> 00:39:03.179
Caption: remember what your competitive

00:39:00.358 --> 00:39:05.939
Caption: advantages and focus on that

00:39:03.179 --> 00:39:07.559
Caption: there generally is time to

00:39:05.939 --> 00:39:10.858
Caption: scale up later to a bit of

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:13.619
Caption: re-architecturing if you&#39;re doing well

00:39:10.858 --> 00:39:16.319
Caption: so with this we&#39;re doing a bit better

00:39:13.618 --> 00:39:18.358
Caption: we&#39;ve maybe adopted grpc for our service

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:20.280
Caption: to service comms

00:39:18.358 --> 00:39:22.500
Caption: we know what sort of throughput we need

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.919
Caption: to handle and we have a plan in place

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.919
Caption: for it

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:29.640
Caption: and product isn&#39;t getting any nasty

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:31.199
Caption: surprises we&#39;ve reasoned about

00:39:29.639 --> 00:39:34.379
Caption: how

00:39:31.199 --> 00:39:37.199
Caption: our system is going to perform it&#39;s how

00:39:34.379 --> 00:39:38.819
Caption: it&#39;s going to behave for customers

00:39:37.199 --> 00:39:40.679
Caption: it&#39;s always going to be buggy I don&#39;t

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:43.199
Caption: think we can solve that one that&#39;s a

00:39:40.679 --> 00:39:44.578
Caption: tell for a different day

00:39:43.199 --> 00:39:47.399
Caption: the point is we&#39;re not trying to

00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:48.540
Caption: completely avoid failure here we&#39;re just

00:39:47.399 --> 00:39:51.118
Caption: trying to make sure we do our due

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:53.520
Caption: diligence and we&#39;ve reasoned about our

00:39:51.118 --> 00:39:55.739
Caption: system sensibly

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.899
Caption: so

00:39:55.739 --> 00:40:00.300
Caption: the key takeaway is just quickly please

00:39:57.899 --> 00:40:03.659
Caption: please please talk to products ask lots

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:06.119
Caption: of questions we need to stop this habit

00:40:03.659 --> 00:40:07.919
Caption: I still see of waiting for product to

00:40:06.118 --> 00:40:09.419
Caption: give us our requirements or product just

00:40:07.919 --> 00:40:12.059
Caption: giving the engineering team requirements

00:40:09.419 --> 00:40:13.559
Caption: and not really expecting any questions

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.739
Caption: we can get a lot of value out of just

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.739
Caption: talking

00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:20.280
Caption: again designed with intent explain why

00:40:18.899 --> 00:40:24.078
Caption: you&#39;ve chosen something

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.079
Caption: and why you haven&#39;t chosen something

00:40:26.099 --> 00:40:29.300
Caption: design often

00:40:29.459 --> 00:40:33.060
Caption: you&#39;re going to do this a lot at your

00:40:31.139 --> 00:40:35.219
Caption: workplace if you get into this good

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.540
Caption: habit you&#39;re going to get a lot of very

00:40:35.219 --> 00:40:38.219
Caption: you&#39;re going to build a lot of

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:39.959
Caption: experience assistant design is something

00:40:38.219 --> 00:40:41.280
Caption: that does take a lot of experience but

00:40:39.959 --> 00:40:43.020
Caption: if you get in the habit of thinking

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.520
Caption: about it the right way

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:46.739
Caption: it&#39;s really going to improve your

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:48.179
Caption: ability to

00:40:46.739 --> 00:40:51.959
Caption: reason

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:53.578
Caption: design makes sense right practice

00:40:51.959 --> 00:40:55.618
Caption: on the side there&#39;s so much great

00:40:53.579 --> 00:40:58.560
Caption: information about their white papers

00:40:55.618 --> 00:41:00.299
Caption: Tech blogs videos go and do your study

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.800
Caption: look at how Twitter&#39;s built there&#39;s lots

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.560
Caption: of stuff out there Instagram Netflix

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.540
Caption: there&#39;s so much free material out there

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.760
Caption: you can kind of run through why they did

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:12.179
Caption: a certain way and then take a step back

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:16.409
Caption: and try to design it yourself

00:41:12.179 --> 00:41:24.300
Caption: cool uh thank you very much

00:41:16.409 --> 00:41:26.459
Caption: [Applause]

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:29.099
Caption: Nick that was a great talk so to get a

00:41:26.459 --> 00:41:32.280
Caption: job at Google I don&#39;t follow the recipe

00:41:29.099 --> 00:41:35.180
Caption: I just follow that recipe and innovate

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.179
Caption: yes

00:41:35.579 --> 00:41:38.760
Caption: um

00:41:36.659 --> 00:41:40.379
Caption: at the interview itself you just want to

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:43.800
Caption: follow in a structured way and this was

00:41:40.379 --> 00:41:45.419
Caption: actually something that

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.179
Caption: we

00:41:45.419 --> 00:41:49.020
Caption: really agreed was a really nice

00:41:48.179 --> 00:41:50.699
Caption: structured way of doing it

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:53.699
Caption: non-functional requirements function

00:41:50.699 --> 00:41:55.020
Caption: requirements like how much how much

00:41:53.699 --> 00:41:57.780
Caption: traffic your servers are going to need

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:59.219
Caption: to handle schema stuff like that you

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.479
Caption: just want to be able to explain these

00:41:59.219 --> 00:42:02.459
Caption: things and it&#39;s so important when you&#39;re

00:42:00.479 --> 00:42:04.560
Caption: talking to stakeholders or senior

00:42:02.459 --> 00:42:06.780
Caption: engineering leadership as well so I can

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.479
Caption: use that throughout my working life

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:11.520
Caption: really absolutely perfect okay so I&#39;m

00:42:09.479 --> 00:42:13.560
Caption: going to open up the floor for a q a

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.599
Caption: session uh does anyone have a question

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:19.400
Caption: for Nick

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:19.400
Caption: okay this man over here please

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:25.380
Caption: hey

00:42:23.879 --> 00:42:27.719
Caption: working yeah

00:42:25.379 --> 00:42:30.239
Caption: uh well thanks for excellent talk

00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:32.280
Caption: um so you you mentioned you know uh

00:42:30.239 --> 00:42:34.379
Caption: always reason about why you choose one

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.880
Caption: tag over the other and it&#39;s built on

00:42:34.379 --> 00:42:39.059
Caption: assumption that you know all the tech

00:42:35.879 --> 00:42:40.259
Caption: and you pretty much and you know you

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.839
Caption: know what&#39;s out there you know

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:45.118
Caption: Alternatives you know pros and cons

00:42:41.839 --> 00:42:47.220
Caption: what&#39;s like the the best behavior if you

00:42:45.118 --> 00:42:48.959
Caption: deal with some systems that you don&#39;t

00:42:47.219 --> 00:42:51.739
Caption: know much about like I don&#39;t know

00:42:48.959 --> 00:42:54.780
Caption: someone told you to design time series

00:42:51.739 --> 00:42:57.118
Caption: heavy application and you don&#39;t have a

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:59.280
Caption: previous experience so how would you

00:42:57.118 --> 00:43:00.959
Caption: you know operate in these kind of

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.119
Caption: situations yeah that&#39;s a really good

00:43:00.959 --> 00:43:04.858
Caption: question if someone approached me and

00:43:03.118 --> 00:43:07.318
Caption: said hey I&#39;d like to build this with a

00:43:04.858 --> 00:43:10.019
Caption: Time series database

00:43:07.319 --> 00:43:11.400
Caption: I&#39;d basically say why the first thing

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.479
Caption: you want to ask is what are we trying to

00:43:11.399 --> 00:43:14.159
Caption: solve

00:43:12.479 --> 00:43:17.159
Caption: what are we

00:43:14.159 --> 00:43:18.899
Caption: what is the problem that needs a Time

00:43:17.159 --> 00:43:21.500
Caption: series database for example if it&#39;s

00:43:18.899 --> 00:43:21.500
Caption: something like

00:43:21.659 --> 00:43:27.179
Caption: obviously time based right like a lot of

00:43:24.899 --> 00:43:28.260
Caption: observability metrics something like

00:43:27.179 --> 00:43:29.818
Caption: that

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:31.919
Caption: then

00:43:29.819 --> 00:43:33.719
Caption: sure

00:43:31.919 --> 00:43:34.979
Caption: it&#39;s not something I&#39;d probably

00:43:33.719 --> 00:43:36.179
Caption: discourage people from trying to Deep

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:37.800
Caption: dive into everything that&#39;s not

00:43:36.179 --> 00:43:39.540
Caption: something you can do

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.920
Caption: instead you want to have awareness of

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.719
Caption: the different classes of database so

00:43:40.919 --> 00:43:44.159
Caption: you&#39;ve got your like you know why column

00:43:42.719 --> 00:43:46.260
Caption: stores like Cassandra or your time

00:43:44.159 --> 00:43:47.818
Caption: series database like you mentioned graph

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:50.280
Caption: database and so on

00:43:47.819 --> 00:43:52.140
Caption: as long as you have an awareness of it

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:55.020
Caption: then you could you can go back and say

00:43:52.139 --> 00:43:56.338
Caption: Hey Okay after our discussion looks like

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:58.500
Caption: the time series database is the right

00:43:56.339 --> 00:44:00.359
Caption: way to go I don&#39;t have much experience

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.800
Caption: on this I&#39;m going to have to do a bit of

00:44:00.358 --> 00:44:04.559
Caption: a deep dive on it and I think that&#39;s

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:08.119
Caption: that&#39;s a plenty reasonable path forwards

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.119
Caption: does that kind of ask the question yeah

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:29.819
Caption: I think there&#39;s a

00:44:26.459 --> 00:44:31.318
Caption: Indian views so what can happen is if

00:44:29.819 --> 00:44:33.119
Caption: you thrive technology you aren&#39;t very

00:44:31.319 --> 00:44:35.219
Caption: confident about it can really fall apart

00:44:33.118 --> 00:44:37.260
Caption: and that&#39;s why stress is so important to

00:44:35.219 --> 00:44:39.419
Caption: learn about the underlying concepts of

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:41.040
Caption: how these things work instead rather

00:44:39.419 --> 00:44:42.780
Caption: than saying I need to know I need

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.000
Caption: to know SQL

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.880
Caption: you want to learn about how these how

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.739
Caption: SQL databases operate right so at the

00:44:47.879 --> 00:44:51.598
Caption: lowest level they&#39;ve got these logs that

00:44:49.739 --> 00:44:54.000
Caption: they need to make durable and from that

00:44:51.599 --> 00:44:54.720
Caption: they&#39;ll kind of project some data out of

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.239
Caption: it

00:44:54.719 --> 00:44:59.098
Caption: with eventually consistent systems

00:44:57.239 --> 00:45:01.679
Caption: you&#39;ve got

00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:03.359
Caption: distributed rights

00:45:01.679 --> 00:45:05.459
Caption: and then there&#39;s some work there around

00:45:03.358 --> 00:45:07.379
Caption: gaining consensus around what what data

00:45:05.459 --> 00:45:10.199
Caption: is there that kind of stuff so my best

00:45:07.379 --> 00:45:11.639
Caption: advice is to really focus on the

00:45:10.199 --> 00:45:13.500
Caption: concepts that power these Technologies

00:45:11.639 --> 00:45:15.838
Caption: don&#39;t focus on Technologies themselves

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:19.079
Caption: too much if you do this well you can

00:45:15.839 --> 00:45:21.119
Caption: actually look at what benefits a new

00:45:19.079 --> 00:45:22.560
Caption: product proposes and say I reckon they

00:45:21.118 --> 00:45:24.118
Caption: did it this way

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.739
Caption: and if you&#39;re getting that right often

00:45:24.118 --> 00:45:27.239
Caption: and if you if you&#39;re able to say I

00:45:25.739 --> 00:45:28.739
Caption: reckon cockroach does things this way

00:45:27.239 --> 00:45:30.659
Caption: that&#39;s how they got these Secret Sauce

00:45:28.739 --> 00:45:32.219
Caption: but I reckon it&#39;s something like this if

00:45:30.659 --> 00:45:35.899
Caption: you can start looking at that level

00:45:32.219 --> 00:45:35.899
Caption: you&#39;re really on the right track I think

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:41.839
Caption: thank you

00:45:38.639 --> 00:45:41.838
Caption: yes t

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.660
Caption: you mentioned about a tip if you have

00:45:48.839 --> 00:45:53.700
Caption: how you go about startup that discussion

00:45:51.659 --> 00:45:55.379
Caption: with products how do you actually drive

00:45:53.699 --> 00:45:57.959
Caption: that I think that was a great takeaway

00:45:55.379 --> 00:46:00.719
Caption: for me yeah thank you yeah

00:45:57.959 --> 00:46:03.300
Caption: um so that&#39;s a good question

00:46:00.719 --> 00:46:04.858
Caption: it&#39;s it depends on your organization a

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:06.060
Caption: lot if it&#39;s a very hierarchical one and

00:46:04.858 --> 00:46:09.118
Caption: you&#39;re just getting tickets over the

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:12.180
Caption: fence it&#39;s a lot of work to go and reach

00:46:09.118 --> 00:46:14.779
Caption: that Gap but I think

00:46:12.179 --> 00:46:14.780
Caption: generally

00:46:14.939 --> 00:46:19.439
Caption: you just acting good faith for example

00:46:17.939 --> 00:46:21.659
Caption: if you go

00:46:19.439 --> 00:46:23.098
Caption: to a product person to someone who&#39;s a

00:46:21.659 --> 00:46:25.739
Caption: real decision maker and you say hey

00:46:23.099 --> 00:46:27.480
Caption: here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been asked to build

00:46:25.739 --> 00:46:30.060
Caption: I&#39;d like to know what the problems are

00:46:27.479 --> 00:46:31.260
Caption: trying to solve are and really get some

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.380
Caption: consensus on what we&#39;re trying to

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.380
Caption: deliver

00:46:33.419 --> 00:46:37.260
Caption: I think most people will be very open to

00:46:35.219 --> 00:46:38.819
Caption: that I think a lot of

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.679
Caption: non-engineering people would take to

00:46:38.819 --> 00:46:43.079
