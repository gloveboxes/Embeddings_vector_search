00:51:06.879 --> 00:51:12.799

00:51:10.079 --> 00:51:15.920
Caption: your nervous system has felt it you have

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:18.400
Caption: the memory you see it in your eye in

00:51:15.919 --> 00:51:20.479

00:51:18.399 --> 00:51:22.799
Caption: happen before

00:51:20.479 --> 00:51:24.639

00:51:24.639 --> 00:51:28.639
Caption: i do this for kids in my family so you

00:51:26.639 --> 00:51:30.399
Caption: know we got lots of stories

00:51:28.639 --> 00:51:32.799
Caption: we get together we start telling the

00:51:30.399 --> 00:51:34.879
Caption: story and you&#39;re talking about how oh

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.559
Caption: you know remember that one time

00:51:34.879 --> 00:51:38.879
Caption: when mom sent me down to the corner

00:51:36.559 --> 00:51:40.640
Caption: store and i had the money in my hand and

00:51:38.879 --> 00:51:42.879
Caption: i was riding my bike and i was going and

00:51:40.639 --> 00:51:44.399
Caption: then it fell off the curb and the coins

00:51:42.879 --> 00:51:46.000
Caption: went everywhere and your brother goes

00:51:44.399 --> 00:51:47.520
Caption: hold on

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.839
Caption: that was me

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:51.439
Caption: i was the one who was with the money mom

00:51:49.839 --> 00:51:54.000
Caption: sent me to the corner

00:51:51.439 --> 00:51:56.318
Caption: i have the scar on my knee to prove it

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.199
Caption: like that&#39;s that wasn&#39;t even you

00:51:56.319 --> 00:52:00.160
Caption: right

00:51:57.199 --> 00:52:00.159
Caption: who&#39;s done that before

00:52:00.879 --> 00:52:05.759
Caption: sometimes

00:52:03.358 --> 00:52:06.639
Caption: we lock into these memories

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:09.118
Caption: right

00:52:06.639 --> 00:52:09.118
Caption: we can

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:15.040
Caption: feel these stories we can drive this

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:17.199
Caption: narrative that&#39;s never even really

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.599
Caption: happened to us but we have

00:52:17.199 --> 00:52:22.479
Caption: this experience

00:52:19.599 --> 00:52:24.240
Caption: and so oftentimes our memories they&#39;ll

00:52:22.479 --> 00:52:26.159
Caption: they&#39;ll drive a narrative to which we

00:52:24.239 --> 00:52:29.040
Caption: become emotionally attached and

00:52:26.159 --> 00:52:31.280
Caption: sometimes these emotional attachments

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:33.839
Caption: they can hold us back

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.679
Caption: and when stressed we lock into the way

00:52:33.839 --> 00:52:37.839
Caption: that we feel

00:52:35.679 --> 00:52:38.879
Caption: it starts to become supportive of that

00:52:37.839 --> 00:52:39.839
Caption: stress

00:52:38.879 --> 00:52:40.959
Caption: more

00:52:39.839 --> 00:52:43.440
Caption: and more

00:52:40.959 --> 00:52:44.479
Caption: and more and the more we reinforce that

00:52:43.439 --> 00:52:46.719
Caption: feeling

00:52:44.479 --> 00:52:48.800
Caption: the deeper those memories

00:52:46.719 --> 00:52:49.919
Caption: they get locked into our neural pathways

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.199
Caption: and we&#39;ll talk a little bit more about

00:52:49.919 --> 00:52:53.358
Caption: that process

00:52:51.199 --> 00:52:56.558
Caption: later but you know with lots of help

00:52:53.358 --> 00:52:58.318
Caption: from uh highly trained professionals

00:52:56.559 --> 00:53:01.359
Caption: i&#39;ve been able to

00:52:58.319 --> 00:53:04.880
Caption: learn how to navigate stressful triggers

00:53:01.358 --> 00:53:07.039
Caption: by processing my memories better and

00:53:04.879 --> 00:53:09.679
Caption: releasing emotional attachments that are

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:11.199
Caption: holding me back i&#39;ve learned to change

00:53:09.679 --> 00:53:11.530
Caption: the narrative

00:53:11.199 --> 00:53:13.040

Caption: memory is reliable when my memory is not

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:25.119
Caption: reliable and how it serves me

00:53:22.719 --> 00:53:26.559
Caption: regardless of the accuracy so today i

00:53:25.118 --> 00:53:28.000
Caption: want to share some of that stuff that

00:53:26.559 --> 00:53:31.119
Caption: i&#39;ve learned about improving brain

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.559
Caption: performance and as always please just

00:53:31.118 --> 00:53:34.399

Caption: and i&#39;m not going to be talking about

00:53:43.679 --> 00:53:46.879
Caption: any of that today but i&#39;ve come to

00:53:45.199 --> 00:53:50.000
Caption: realize that the stories that i&#39;ve tell

00:53:46.879 --> 00:53:51.919
Caption: myself and others they can either be the

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.280
Caption: chains that bind me

00:53:51.919 --> 00:53:59.679
Caption: or they can be the keys that release me

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.679
Caption: from that trauma that i aim to overcome

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:05.439

00:54:49.118 --> 00:54:53.679

00:54:51.679 --> 00:54:56.159
Caption: amazing to me to be delivering the

00:54:53.679 --> 00:54:58.159

00:54:56.159 --> 00:55:00.159
Caption: want to say thanks so much to all of the

00:54:58.159 --> 00:55:02.078
Caption: organizers and volunteers and the

00:55:00.159 --> 00:55:03.520
Caption: sponsors for bringing us together today

00:55:02.079 --> 00:55:05.440
Caption: so

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:08.000
Caption: so what

00:55:05.439 --> 00:55:10.318
Caption: our memories they hold the key

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.399
Caption: to better communication to emotional

00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:14.960
Caption: intelligence to

00:55:12.399 --> 00:55:17.760
Caption: being more open to the viewpoints of

00:55:14.959 --> 00:55:20.239
Caption: others and for setting healthy

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:21.919
Caption: boundaries i just realized i&#39;m doing a

00:55:20.239 --> 00:55:24.239
Caption: lot of poses i&#39;m going to stand here for

00:55:21.919 --> 00:55:27.919
Caption: the rest of my talk like this

00:55:24.239 --> 00:55:27.919
Caption: nobody&#39;s winning bingo today

00:55:28.479 --> 00:55:33.439
Caption: but you could see how as a brand

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.280
Caption: strategy consultant

00:55:33.439 --> 00:55:38.000
Caption: you know i&#39;m always looking for ways to

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:40.640
Caption: connect products and services in

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.399
Caption: meaningful ways to our end users and and

00:55:40.639 --> 00:55:44.639
Caption: to our customers you can see how this

00:55:42.399 --> 00:55:46.959
Caption: stuff would be important to me when i&#39;m

00:55:44.639 --> 00:55:49.279
Caption: creating marketing funnels that have

00:55:46.959 --> 00:55:51.280
Caption: emotional triggers attached to them so

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:53.359
Caption: what is memory

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.959
Caption: it&#39;s a faculty by which the mind stores

00:55:53.358 --> 00:55:56.879
Caption: remembers information something

00:55:54.959 --> 00:56:00.078
Caption: remembered from the past

00:55:56.879 --> 00:56:02.479
Caption: it is a recollection which is really a

00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:06.239
Caption: way to say you know memory is the

00:56:02.479 --> 00:56:09.439
Caption: process that we use to encode store and

00:56:06.239 --> 00:56:09.439
Caption: retrieve data

00:56:10.639 --> 00:56:15.118
Caption: this affects our cognition that&#39;s how we

00:56:12.959 --> 00:56:17.520
Caption: think about things and also it affects

00:56:15.118 --> 00:56:21.439
Caption: our behavior how

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:24.880
Caption: we respond our observable responses and

00:56:21.439 --> 00:56:28.000
Caption: so our brains are constantly taking in

00:56:24.879 --> 00:56:29.759
Caption: data both internal and external we have

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.118
Caption: all of these stimuli and we&#39;re

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:34.719
Caption: processing data in real time um

00:56:33.118 --> 00:56:35.760
Caption: based on all the new information that we

00:56:34.719 --> 00:56:37.679
Caption: take in

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:40.239
Caption: mixed with the information that&#39;s

00:56:37.679 --> 00:56:42.879
Caption: already in there right and so these days

00:56:40.239 --> 00:56:45.679
Caption: what we know as memory is actually it&#39;s

00:56:42.879 --> 00:56:48.000
Caption: an interconnected group of memory

00:56:45.679 --> 00:56:50.318
Caption: subsystems right we used to think that

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.280
Caption: there&#39;s left brain and right brain

00:56:50.319 --> 00:56:55.599
Caption: that&#39;s actually not how our brains work

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.679
Caption: and these multiple memory systems

00:56:55.599 --> 00:57:00.640
Caption: they&#39;re constantly processing data and

00:56:57.679 --> 00:57:04.479
Caption: they&#39;re able to function together or

00:57:00.639 --> 00:57:06.719
Caption: independently of each other

00:57:04.479 --> 00:57:09.439
Caption: so memories are weird

00:57:06.719 --> 00:57:11.760
Caption: memories can be compressed

00:57:09.439 --> 00:57:14.239
Caption: our brain has this quality where you

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.839
Caption: know if the stimulus is the same over

00:57:14.239 --> 00:57:17.679
Caption: and over again

00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:19.440
Caption: our memories will just compress it

00:57:17.679 --> 00:57:22.318
Caption: because it&#39;s the same day who&#39;s done

00:57:19.439 --> 00:57:24.399
Caption: this recently when you said i do this

00:57:22.319 --> 00:57:26.319
Caption: oh yeah last time you were over my house

00:57:24.399 --> 00:57:28.719
Caption: for dinner six months ago and we did

00:57:26.319 --> 00:57:31.040
Caption: board games and we did

00:57:28.719 --> 00:57:32.639
Caption: no christina that was a year and six

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:34.640
Caption: months ago

00:57:32.639 --> 00:57:37.598
Caption: because everybody&#39;s living been living

00:57:34.639 --> 00:57:40.479
Caption: the same day over and over and over and

00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:43.040
Caption: over again because of covid and so our

00:57:40.479 --> 00:57:45.520
Caption: brain has this quality for efficiency

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:48.079
Caption: that it just compresses the memories

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:51.760
Caption: right and so remember it&#39;s our emotions

00:57:48.079 --> 00:57:53.599
Caption: that that drive that narrative for our

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:56.000
Caption: memories and so even though we can&#39;t

00:57:53.599 --> 00:57:57.920
Caption: give our brain more processing power

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.599
Caption: like like we can for our machines we can

00:57:57.919 --> 00:58:01.598
Caption: just insert some

00:57:59.599 --> 00:58:03.520
Caption: more processing power into our computers

00:58:01.599 --> 00:58:04.960
Caption: we can&#39;t do that for our brains but we

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:07.359
Caption: can

00:58:04.959 --> 00:58:09.358
Caption: we can look for unconscious biases we

00:58:07.358 --> 00:58:11.679
Caption: can look for inefficient processes in

00:58:09.358 --> 00:58:13.358
Caption: our brains and we can actually with

00:58:11.679 --> 00:58:15.760
Caption: practice

00:58:13.358 --> 00:58:18.318
Caption: improve our brain performance so i&#39;m

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:20.719
Caption: going to uh share with you some of the

00:58:18.319 --> 00:58:23.359
Caption: ways that our brains might fail us and

00:58:20.719 --> 00:58:24.799
Caption: ways that we can improve our memories

00:58:23.358 --> 00:58:27.199
Caption: today and i&#39;m not saying that you know

00:58:24.799 --> 00:58:30.559
Caption: you can completely forget things or

00:58:27.199 --> 00:58:32.719
Caption: that&#39;ll erase away things but we can

00:58:30.559 --> 00:58:34.959
Caption: improve how we process things this has

00:58:32.719 --> 00:58:36.879
Caption: especially been helpful for my mentees

00:58:34.959 --> 00:58:39.118
Caption: for my coaching clients who are going

00:58:36.879 --> 00:58:40.959
Caption: through long covid right who&#39;s been

00:58:39.118 --> 00:58:43.598
Caption: experiencing a lot of brain fog in the

00:58:40.959 --> 00:58:45.598
Caption: past couple of years that is a real

00:58:43.599 --> 00:58:47.680
Caption: issue and so

00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:50.160
Caption: if you can just focus on one of these

00:58:47.679 --> 00:58:52.078
Caption: techniques for three months and then

00:58:50.159 --> 00:58:54.000
Caption: move on to the next one then okay cool

00:58:52.079 --> 00:58:55.280
Caption: i&#39;m gonna share with you a whole lot of

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.399
Caption: techniques that i&#39;ve learned and been

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.719
Caption: practicing

00:58:56.399 --> 00:59:00.000
Caption: in the last four years it&#39;s been really

00:58:58.719 --> 00:59:02.639
Caption: cool

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.639
Caption: check this out

00:59:03.199 --> 00:59:07.358
Caption: so today we&#39;re going to talk about these

00:59:05.118 --> 00:59:09.039
Caption: types of memory systems

00:59:07.358 --> 00:59:11.279
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk about the biological

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:14.479
Caption: storage about improving daily

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:17.520
Caption: performance about your confidence so for

00:59:14.479 --> 00:59:19.118
Caption: an example if you are

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.959
Caption: if you are

00:59:19.118 --> 00:59:23.439
Caption: if you&#39;re starting for a new job

00:59:20.959 --> 00:59:25.679
Caption: right you&#39;re starting a new job and you

00:59:23.439 --> 00:59:27.199
Caption: get to introduce yourself to people

00:59:25.679 --> 00:59:30.558
Caption: around the office

00:59:27.199 --> 00:59:32.719
Caption: you want people to observe you

00:59:30.559 --> 00:59:35.839
Caption: recognizing other people&#39;s names and

00:59:32.719 --> 00:59:37.520
Caption: having that memory and holding on to

00:59:35.839 --> 00:59:39.680
Caption: other people&#39;s names because then you

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:40.959
Caption: appear more confident and so that is a

00:59:39.679 --> 00:59:43.199
Caption: quality that&#39;s going to be more

00:59:40.959 --> 00:59:44.559
Caption: beneficial to you right

00:59:43.199 --> 00:59:46.000
Caption: emotional intelligence we&#39;re going to

00:59:44.559 --> 00:59:47.440
Caption: talk about that a little bit i could

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.719
Caption: talk about that all day but we don&#39;t

00:59:47.439 --> 00:59:50.719
Caption: have all day

00:59:48.719 --> 00:59:54.000
Caption: and then you know conflict conflict is

00:59:50.719 --> 00:59:56.399
Caption: inevitable and so there is a one-way

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.159
Caption: extreme way to respond to a situation

00:59:56.399 --> 01:00:01.520
Caption: and there&#39;s another extreme way to

00:59:58.159 --> 01:00:04.078
Caption: respond to a situation i kind of try to

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:07.040
Caption: waver around the middle so that when we

01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:08.640
Caption: have informed choices to choose from

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:11.439
Caption: then we&#39;re going to pick the best

01:00:08.639 --> 01:00:14.798
Caption: possible response to get the best

01:00:11.439 --> 01:00:16.318
Caption: possible results in a situation

01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:18.880
Caption: so barrick and ebbinghaus they&#39;re the

01:00:16.319 --> 01:00:20.799
Caption: ones who conducted this research in 1984

01:00:18.879 --> 01:00:22.959
Caption: and they found that most of the

01:00:20.799 --> 01:00:24.400
Caption: forgetting happens between the ages of

01:00:22.959 --> 01:00:26.959
Caption: four to five that&#39;s when our memory

01:00:24.399 --> 01:00:28.879
Caption: subsystems start to develop and we have

01:00:26.959 --> 01:00:31.040
Caption: two of them declarative and

01:00:28.879 --> 01:00:33.679
Caption: non-declarative so we have a different

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:36.799
Caption: memory subsystem for for memorializing

01:00:33.679 --> 01:00:38.798
Caption: like algebraic formulas for example or

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:41.599
Caption: or a different memory subsystem for

01:00:38.799 --> 01:00:43.040
Caption: doing on-the-spot math right in fact

01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:45.359
Caption: there&#39;s this quality called memory

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:48.559
Caption: consolidation who&#39;s heard of that before

01:00:45.358 --> 01:00:52.479
Caption: memory consolidation it&#39;s when you go to

01:00:48.559 --> 01:00:55.040
Caption: sleep right and you get the benefit of

01:00:52.479 --> 01:00:56.399
Caption: consolidating your memories and and it

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.119
Caption: really strengthens

01:00:56.399 --> 01:01:00.798
Caption: those neural pathways and synaptic

01:00:59.118 --> 01:01:03.199
Caption: connections between the neurons

01:01:00.799 --> 01:01:06.719
Caption: structurally and chemically that is

01:01:03.199 --> 01:01:06.719
Caption: called memory consolidation

01:01:07.118 --> 01:01:11.598
Caption: our declarative memory

01:01:08.879 --> 01:01:14.239
Caption: it&#39;s your conscious memory

01:01:11.599 --> 01:01:16.160
Caption: it involves effort involves intention

01:01:14.239 --> 01:01:18.559
Caption: and so we can use intentional techniques

01:01:16.159 --> 01:01:21.679
Caption: we do tests we do aptitude tests we do

01:01:18.559 --> 01:01:23.119
Caption: the lsat for attorneys we we do certain

01:01:21.679 --> 01:01:25.280
Caption: um

01:01:23.118 --> 01:01:27.838
Caption: mnemonics or repetition right and

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.919
Caption: biologically it&#39;s the hippocampus that

01:01:27.839 --> 01:01:31.839
Caption: and the frontal lobes that manage this

01:01:29.919 --> 01:01:34.000
Caption: part of our memory the declarative

01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:36.480
Caption: memory system it can be measured with

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Caption: those explicit tests so check this out

01:01:36.479 --> 01:01:39.760
Caption: these are the three different types that

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.479
Caption: we have we have working memory and

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:45.520
Caption: people who struggle with adhd usually

01:01:42.479 --> 01:01:47.838
Caption: this is the type of memory subsystem

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:51.199
Caption: that is challenged most for them because

01:01:47.839 --> 01:01:52.480
Caption: you only have two to 18 seconds for the

01:01:51.199 --> 01:01:55.040
Caption: old information

01:01:52.479 --> 01:01:57.199
Caption: to collide with the new information and

01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:00.319
Caption: then you process it right the the

01:01:57.199 --> 01:02:02.959
Caption: biological uh part of your brain

01:02:00.319 --> 01:02:06.319
Caption: uh that&#39;s a present is the ability to to

01:02:02.959 --> 01:02:07.838
Caption: help you take in that new information

01:02:06.319 --> 01:02:10.479
Caption: and then we have episodic memory

01:02:07.839 --> 01:02:13.760
Caption: episodic memory this is our long-term

01:02:10.479 --> 01:02:16.399
Caption: memory system um but it&#39;s about specific

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:19.599
Caption: life events right this is where we we

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:20.479
Caption: store our our wedding day memories

01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:22.319
Caption: that

01:02:20.479 --> 01:02:25.760
Caption: one time and christina aldan gave an

01:02:22.319 --> 01:02:28.640
Caption: amazing keynote at ddd perth wow right

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.479
Caption: these episodic memories when you&#39;re

01:02:28.639 --> 01:02:32.479
Caption: riding your bike and you&#39;re holding on

01:02:30.479 --> 01:02:34.879
Caption: to the coins and then your bike falls

01:02:32.479 --> 01:02:37.439
Caption: and the coins go everywhere

01:02:34.879 --> 01:02:39.439
Caption: episodic memory subsystem is where that

01:02:37.439 --> 01:02:42.159
Caption: is stored and then we have our semantic

01:02:39.439 --> 01:02:44.879
Caption: memory subsystem and you know this is

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:48.239
Caption: general knowledge this is two plus two

01:02:44.879 --> 01:02:52.318
Caption: is four right the capital loss of nevada

01:02:48.239 --> 01:02:55.199
Caption: is carson city the the factual general

01:02:52.319 --> 01:02:56.239
Caption: knowledge if i have a red ball in my

01:02:55.199 --> 01:02:57.838
Caption: hand

01:02:56.239 --> 01:02:59.598
Caption: and i decide to

01:02:57.839 --> 01:03:03.119
Caption: fling it all the way to the back of the

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:03.920
Caption: room take that speaker pose bingo

01:03:03.118 --> 01:03:06.399
Caption: i

01:03:03.919 --> 01:03:09.679
Caption: have the red bull and maybe for your

01:03:06.399 --> 01:03:12.639
Caption: semantic memory maybe you see it okay

01:03:09.679 --> 01:03:15.439
Caption: did she throw it yes was the ball read

01:03:12.639 --> 01:03:18.159
Caption: general factual information there&#39;s no

01:03:15.439 --> 01:03:20.959
Caption: narrative or emotion attached to it what

01:03:18.159 --> 01:03:24.000
Caption: happens when we start attaching a memory

01:03:20.959 --> 01:03:25.679
Caption: to it that&#39;s a a narrative to it that&#39;s

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.760
Caption: a little bit different

01:03:25.679 --> 01:03:30.159
Caption: oh my gosh did you see christina winged

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:32.880
Caption: that ball right past my head she almost

01:03:30.159 --> 01:03:33.919
Caption: hit me what a jerk right that&#39;s a

01:03:32.879 --> 01:03:36.078
Caption: totally

01:03:33.919 --> 01:03:38.318
Caption: different memory subsystem semantic

01:03:36.079 --> 01:03:40.799
Caption: memory only works with the general

01:03:38.319 --> 01:03:42.719
Caption: knowledge

01:03:40.799 --> 01:03:44.959
Caption: then there&#39;s non-declarative memory this

01:03:42.719 --> 01:03:47.199
Caption: is your unconscious mind memory it is

01:03:44.959 --> 01:03:50.879
Caption: inherently there it&#39;s automatically

01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:53.118
Caption: there your biases uh instantly are there

01:03:50.879 --> 01:03:55.838
Caption: and it requires zero effort it&#39;s

01:03:53.118 --> 01:03:57.838
Caption: unintentional right biologically this is

01:03:55.839 --> 01:04:00.720
Caption: our cortical areas of our brain the

01:03:57.839 --> 01:04:02.799
Caption: cerebellum the basal ganglia

01:04:00.719 --> 01:04:05.598
Caption: they&#39;re the ones that govern the

01:04:02.799 --> 01:04:08.000
Caption: non-declarative memory subsystem and so

01:04:05.599 --> 01:04:10.480
Caption: this is really imperative for forming

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.479
Caption: new memories you&#39;ll see if people have

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:14.159
Caption: amnesia and they&#39;re struggling with that

01:04:12.479 --> 01:04:16.079
Caption: usually they have maybe damage to their

01:04:14.159 --> 01:04:20.000
Caption: cerebellum or something like that and so

01:04:16.079 --> 01:04:22.160
Caption: people um can can improve by even you

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.839
Caption: know focusing on activities that are

01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:25.679
Caption: going to stimulate the basal ganglia the

01:04:23.839 --> 01:04:27.359
Caption: cortical areas the cerebellum and of

01:04:25.679 --> 01:04:28.558
Caption: course there are three

01:04:27.358 --> 01:04:30.798
Caption: different

01:04:28.559 --> 01:04:33.119
Caption: memory subsystems priming our memory we

01:04:30.799 --> 01:04:35.199
Caption: can prime our memory by

01:04:33.118 --> 01:04:36.159
Caption: repetition there are certain things like

01:04:35.199 --> 01:04:38.159
Caption: um

01:04:36.159 --> 01:04:40.959
Caption: you can prime your memory

01:04:38.159 --> 01:04:44.159
Caption: with a perfume right you&#39;re at you&#39;re at

01:04:40.959 --> 01:04:46.318
Caption: the grocery and you go walk by and

01:04:44.159 --> 01:04:48.078
Caption: little grandma comes by and oh she

01:04:46.319 --> 01:04:50.079
Caption: smells like your little grandma because

01:04:48.079 --> 01:04:53.039
Caption: she&#39;s wearing that same perfume we can

01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:54.239
Caption: prime our memory with those kinds of

01:04:53.039 --> 01:04:55.599
Caption: things and then we also have

01:04:54.239 --> 01:04:58.639
Caption: conditioning

01:04:55.599 --> 01:05:00.720
Caption: conditioning is like pablob&#39;s dog

01:04:58.639 --> 01:05:03.439
Caption: who&#39;s heard of pablob&#39;s dog here most

01:05:00.719 --> 01:05:05.919
Caption: everybody right he rang the bell he fed

01:05:03.439 --> 01:05:08.479
Caption: the dog the dog would salivate ring the

01:05:05.919 --> 01:05:11.439
Caption: bell feed the dog dog would salivate

01:05:08.479 --> 01:05:13.358
Caption: pretty soon all he had to do is

01:05:11.439 --> 01:05:16.399
Caption: ring the bell that&#39;s it and the dog

01:05:13.358 --> 01:05:19.279
Caption: would salivate exactly and so we can

01:05:16.399 --> 01:05:21.679
Caption: condition our brain patterns through

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:24.880
Caption: things like neuro-linguistic programming

01:05:21.679 --> 01:05:27.358
Caption: or through hypnosis certain techniques

01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:29.519
Caption: that will help improve your

01:05:27.358 --> 01:05:31.759
Caption: condition brain and then we have our

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:34.239
Caption: motor procedural memory this is a

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.639
Caption: physical repetition over and over and

01:05:34.239 --> 01:05:39.199
Caption: over again hitting a baseball hitting a

01:05:36.639 --> 01:05:43.279
Caption: golf ball dribbling a basketball these

01:05:39.199 --> 01:05:45.838
Caption: are a motor procedural memory subsystem

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.880
Caption: stimuli

01:05:45.839 --> 01:05:48.720
Caption: so

01:05:46.879 --> 01:05:51.038
Caption: when these different

01:05:48.719 --> 01:05:54.559
Caption: subsystems are stimulated right they

01:05:51.039 --> 01:05:57.199
Caption: start encoding storing and retrieving

01:05:54.559 --> 01:05:58.959
Caption: data together and sometimes not together

01:05:57.199 --> 01:06:01.118
Caption: sometimes a memory subsystem will be

01:05:58.959 --> 01:06:03.039
Caption: isolated from the other one and it won&#39;t

01:06:01.118 --> 01:06:06.639
Caption: be activated so for example let&#39;s taking

01:06:03.039 --> 01:06:06.640
Caption: it let&#39;s say you&#39;re taking a math final

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:12.399
Caption: all right we&#39;ve learned semantic memory

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.760
Caption: is going to store that formula right

01:06:12.399 --> 01:06:17.598
Caption: general factual knowledge cool all right

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:19.520
Caption: but then you sit down to take your math

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:22.240
Caption: final and

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.239
Caption: your brain goes

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:29.038
Caption: somehow your short-term memory there

01:06:26.639 --> 01:06:30.159
Caption: is not giving you access either maybe

01:06:29.039 --> 01:06:32.160
Caption: you have

01:06:30.159 --> 01:06:33.439
Caption: an amygdala hijack and you&#39;re just like

01:06:32.159 --> 01:06:35.118
Caption: panicking and you&#39;re freaking out

01:06:33.439 --> 01:06:36.959
Caption: because you&#39;re not a person who takes

01:06:35.118 --> 01:06:40.239
Caption: tests really well maybe like i said

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:42.159
Caption: maybe you have uh adhd right and so that

01:06:40.239 --> 01:06:44.000
Caption: that new information&#39;s colliding with

01:06:42.159 --> 01:06:45.838
Caption: the old information and it&#39;s just

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.439
Caption: they&#39;re hitting a wall and it&#39;s not

01:06:45.839 --> 01:06:51.039
Caption: happening right and so maybe um this

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:52.719
Caption: this is you&#39;re having a panic attack

01:06:51.039 --> 01:06:55.199
Caption: this is this is a real thing for a lot

01:06:52.719 --> 01:06:57.280
Caption: of people right um and then on top of

01:06:55.199 --> 01:06:59.598
Caption: that maybe you&#39;re suffering from the

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:02.479
Caption: effects of of long covid

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:04.559
Caption: or maybe you&#39;re more of an auditory

01:07:02.479 --> 01:07:07.358
Caption: learner and processor when it comes to

01:07:04.559 --> 01:07:09.599
Caption: math maybe you&#39;re more of a visual

01:07:07.358 --> 01:07:10.959
Caption: learner and process

01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:13.680
Caption: visual

01:07:10.959 --> 01:07:16.159
Caption: cues when it comes to math maybe you&#39;re

01:07:13.679 --> 01:07:17.838
Caption: more of an associative learner right

01:07:16.159 --> 01:07:19.598
Caption: maybe you got to have your favorite

01:07:17.839 --> 01:07:21.599
Caption: conference hoodie when you do your math

01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:22.559
Caption: test because guess what it&#39;s my lucky

01:07:21.599 --> 01:07:24.880
Caption: hoodie

01:07:22.559 --> 01:07:26.479
Caption: we see this with sports people right we

01:07:24.879 --> 01:07:27.439
Caption: see this all the time everybody&#39;s got to

01:07:26.479 --> 01:07:30.000
Caption: have their

01:07:27.439 --> 01:07:32.000
Caption: lucky hoodie they&#39;re not gonna shave my

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.319
Caption: beard because it&#39;s lucky i&#39;m not gonna

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.319
Caption: cut my hair whatever that is but they&#39;re

01:07:34.319 --> 01:07:40.079
Caption: more associative and so that&#39;s how they

01:07:38.319 --> 01:07:41.520
Caption: perform best

01:07:40.079 --> 01:07:42.640
Caption: right

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:45.359
Caption: there are a lot of different pro

01:07:42.639 --> 01:07:46.318
Caption: approaches and the goal is to get your

01:07:45.358 --> 01:07:49.679
Caption: brain

01:07:46.319 --> 01:07:52.400
Caption: to organize information in a way

01:07:49.679 --> 01:07:54.558
Caption: that is optimum for you and guess what

01:07:52.399 --> 01:07:56.558
Caption: there are 7.9 billion different ways to

01:07:54.559 --> 01:07:59.280
Caption: do that ladies and gentlemen so it&#39;s

01:07:56.559 --> 01:08:00.719
Caption: amazing that anything gets done at all

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.959
Caption: in fact we were talking about that last

01:08:00.719 --> 01:08:02.959
Caption: night

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:10.159
Caption: but here&#39;s the thing brains they lie

01:08:08.159 --> 01:08:12.879
Caption: right brains lies we heard in the

01:08:10.159 --> 01:08:16.080
Caption: beginning of my talk brains lie and the

01:08:12.879 --> 01:08:19.758
Caption: more rigid our beliefs are

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:23.040
Caption: the more distracted we are the more our

01:08:19.758 --> 01:08:24.798
Caption: brains are going to lie and if you talk

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.919
Caption: to police

01:08:24.798 --> 01:08:30.399
Caption: at a scene they will say that eyewitness

01:08:27.919 --> 01:08:31.758
Caption: accounts are not accurate

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:33.838
Caption: they can interview

01:08:31.758 --> 01:08:35.439
Caption: 20 different people who are all right

01:08:33.838 --> 01:08:36.560
Caption: there and you&#39;re going to get 20

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:39.278
Caption: different

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.120
Caption: answers because again there&#39;s 7.9

01:08:39.278 --> 01:08:43.838
Caption: billion different ways to process those

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.239
Caption: data and that information right so for

01:08:43.838 --> 01:08:46.238
Caption: example

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:52.479
Caption: our brains can create false memories if

01:08:50.238 --> 01:08:55.198
Caption: you are a person who struggles with

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:57.278
Caption: connecting with others and i mean

01:08:55.199 --> 01:08:58.319
Caption: i mean this is a real thing for a lot of

01:08:57.278 --> 01:09:00.959
Caption: people

01:08:58.318 --> 01:09:02.798
Caption: they deeply want connection and crave

01:09:00.959 --> 01:09:04.399
Caption: connection but are unable to for

01:09:02.798 --> 01:09:05.758
Caption: whatever reason

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:07.198
Caption: find it

01:09:05.758 --> 01:09:09.838
Caption: maybe you&#39;re sitting at home and you&#39;re

01:09:07.199 --> 01:09:13.520
Caption: thinking about that

01:09:09.838 --> 01:09:15.439
Caption: maybe you start ruminating a little bit

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:18.318
Caption: maybe you start feeling a little bit

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:19.520
Caption: from a victim mindset

01:09:18.318 --> 01:09:22.479
Caption: maybe

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:25.120
Caption: you start recalling past memories

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:27.679
Caption: through that victim mindset you can

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.159
Caption: actually create

01:09:27.679 --> 01:09:31.199
Caption: false memories from that

01:09:30.159 --> 01:09:34.400
Caption: and

01:09:31.199 --> 01:09:38.080
Caption: that narrative starts to drive how you

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:40.959
Caption: operate that narrative starts to

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:43.759
Caption: really shift how you see the world and

01:09:40.959 --> 01:09:45.600
Caption: create these false memories and you know

01:09:43.758 --> 01:09:48.718
Caption: our brains are totally capable of this

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:51.279
Caption: in cases of extreme trauma even your

01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:52.960
Caption: brain might dissociate from the memories

01:09:51.278 --> 01:09:54.799
Caption: altogether

01:09:52.959 --> 01:09:57.520
Caption: so here&#39;s a perfect example let&#39;s say

01:09:54.799 --> 01:09:59.279
Caption: you went to go see the new avengers

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.890
Caption: movie i guess it&#39;s the doctor strange

01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:03.119

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:07.760
Caption: you go to see the new adventures move

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.439
Caption: and you&#39;re like hey this is such a great

01:10:07.759 --> 01:10:10.559

Caption: thing i mean it was so awesome enjoy

01:10:35.279 --> 01:10:39.759
Caption: sitting there going

01:10:37.279 --> 01:10:41.359
Caption: you&#39;re kidding right

01:10:39.759 --> 01:10:43.519
Caption: it was me

01:10:41.359 --> 01:10:45.439
Caption: i was there i was there with you and

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:48.319
Caption: here&#39;s the thing it&#39;s not that you did

01:10:45.439 --> 01:10:50.238

Caption: john like we&#39;re all friends

01:10:50.238 --> 01:10:55.519
Caption: no it&#39;s just that your focus

01:10:53.439 --> 01:10:56.959
Caption: was on the movie itself and so your

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.120
Caption: brain just kind of

01:10:56.959 --> 01:11:01.279
Caption: fills in the the friend spot i&#39;ve

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:04.080
Caption: totally done this before by the way it&#39;s

01:11:01.279 --> 01:11:06.000
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s not awesome um but

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.320
Caption: you you can you could totally create

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.600
Caption: these these false memories your brain is

01:11:08.319 --> 01:11:13.040
Caption: is perfectly capable about that of that

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.239
Caption: interruptions i want to say a quick

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.679
Caption: thing about interruptions because we

01:11:14.238 --> 01:11:18.879
Caption: have retroactive and proactive

01:11:15.679 --> 01:11:20.640
Caption: interference and i use this as a tool so

01:11:18.879 --> 01:11:22.319
Caption: interruptions i work from home i am a

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.320
Caption: consultant when my kids come running

01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:28.158
Caption: into my office they go hey mom can i run

01:11:24.319 --> 01:11:29.839
Caption: today i go just a minute

01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:32.000
Caption: i give him one of those right because

01:11:29.839 --> 01:11:33.678
Caption: interruptions are the number one reason

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.839
Caption: that we forget and it&#39;s the same thing

01:11:33.679 --> 01:11:38.800
Caption: when we work in big open offices it&#39;s

01:11:35.839 --> 01:11:40.399
Caption: the same thing when somebody runs in now

01:11:38.799 --> 01:11:42.959
Caption: there&#39;s nothing wrong with this what

01:11:40.399 --> 01:11:45.040
Caption: this does is it gives you a pause to

01:11:42.959 --> 01:11:46.319
Caption: finish up the email to finish up the

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:48.640
Caption: thing to

01:11:46.319 --> 01:11:50.718
Caption: finish up the text thread hold on get in

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:52.719
Caption: line you&#39;re number three let me just

01:11:50.719 --> 01:11:55.120
Caption: wrap these up right

01:11:52.719 --> 01:11:56.800
Caption: in fact if you communicate with people

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:59.120
Caption: it&#39;s they&#39;re going to actually

01:11:56.799 --> 01:12:00.799
Caption: appreciate and respect your boundaries

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.679
Caption: and they&#39;re not going to start running

01:12:00.799 --> 01:12:05.599
Caption: into your office as much so um you could

01:12:03.679 --> 01:12:07.600
Caption: you could just you know just one let me

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.120
Caption: just finish this up real quick i have a

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.600
Caption: thought let me finish it up because you

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:14.080
Caption: know what if you don&#39;t

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.159
Caption: it&#39;s gone

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.199
Caption: the interruption has to be significant

01:12:16.159 --> 01:12:19.360
Caption: enough

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:22.000
Caption: in order for you to forget it though so

01:12:19.359 --> 01:12:23.279
Caption: if it&#39;s really fast and my kids are just

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.839
Caption: coming in hey can i have a glass of milk

01:12:23.279 --> 01:12:27.919
Caption: yes go ahead i can keep going no problem

01:12:25.839 --> 01:12:30.080
Caption: i&#39;m not going to drop the balls that i&#39;m

01:12:27.919 --> 01:12:32.238
Caption: juggling right however if they come in

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.199
Caption: and they go mom mom

01:12:36.159 --> 01:12:38.880
Caption: what

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.120
Caption: right

01:12:38.879 --> 01:12:42.718
Caption: or who&#39;s had this uh hey can i ask you a

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.199
Caption: quick question real quick just just take

01:12:42.719 --> 01:12:45.199
Caption: five minutes

01:12:48.839 --> 01:12:52.799
Caption: nope

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:54.399
Caption: give him one of these right

01:12:52.799 --> 01:12:55.919
Caption: just a moment let me finish this thought

01:12:54.399 --> 01:12:57.520
Caption: let me finish this email it&#39;s gonna be a

01:12:55.919 --> 01:12:59.678
Caption: really powerful tool and then you&#39;re not

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:03.040
Caption: going to lose that because interruptions

01:12:59.679 --> 01:13:05.280
Caption: are the number one reason why we forget

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:06.640
Caption: take the look here look at this

01:13:05.279 --> 01:13:10.639
Caption: what you see

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:12.320
Caption: is not always what you get

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.800
Caption: what you see is not always what you get

01:13:12.319 --> 01:13:17.678
Caption: remember what i said eyewitness accounts

01:13:14.799 --> 01:13:19.599
Caption: are not accurate they are not dependable

01:13:17.679 --> 01:13:22.320
Caption: and if you ask 20 different people at a

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:23.840
Caption: scene you&#39;re going to get 20 different

01:13:22.319 --> 01:13:25.678
Caption: answers this has been proved over and

01:13:23.839 --> 01:13:27.919
Caption: over again replicated in laboratories

01:13:25.679 --> 01:13:31.120
Caption: and research all over the planet that we

01:13:27.919 --> 01:13:33.279
Caption: cannot always trust our memories because

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.520
Caption: brains lie so how can we improve our

01:13:33.279 --> 01:13:37.279
Caption: memory it&#39;s totally possible we can

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:40.399
Caption: improve our memory we can improve our

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:43.520
Caption: capacity for learning and we can improve

01:13:40.399 --> 01:13:46.000
Caption: our ability to encode store and retrieve

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.879
Caption: data this is how we do it we used to

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.159
Caption: think

01:13:46.879 --> 01:13:49.839
Caption: that our brains were so much more

01:13:48.159 --> 01:13:51.520
Caption: limited

01:13:49.839 --> 01:13:53.198
Caption: eight nine ten years ago we didn&#39;t know

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:56.080
Caption: anything about the brain we used to say

01:13:53.199 --> 01:13:57.840
Caption: you can&#39;t teach an old dog new tricks

01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:02.320
Caption: who said that before

01:13:57.839 --> 01:14:04.319
Caption: stop saying that it&#39;s not true

01:14:02.319 --> 01:14:06.399
Caption: in fact you can teach an old dog new

01:14:04.319 --> 01:14:09.439
Caption: tricks in fact you can start creating

01:14:06.399 --> 01:14:11.439
Caption: neuro neural pathways as early as five

01:14:09.439 --> 01:14:13.120
Caption: to six hours your brain will start

01:14:11.439 --> 01:14:15.439
Caption: rewiring

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:18.560
Caption: it&#39;s pretty cool if the stimulus is

01:14:15.439 --> 01:14:21.919
Caption: strong enough or repetitive enough

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:24.479
Caption: we can rewire our brain i know this i am

01:14:21.919 --> 01:14:26.399
Caption: living proof of this as somebody who has

01:14:24.479 --> 01:14:28.959
Caption: overcome trauma as somebody who at one

01:14:26.399 --> 01:14:31.839
Caption: point was even catatonic for nine days

01:14:28.959 --> 01:14:34.319
Caption: straight i did not speak

01:14:31.839 --> 01:14:37.198
Caption: these are the ways that i have learned

01:14:34.319 --> 01:14:39.198
Caption: to improve my brain performance and i

01:14:37.199 --> 01:14:41.280
Caption: use it with my mentees my consultants my

01:14:39.199 --> 01:14:44.080
Caption: coaching clients

01:14:41.279 --> 01:14:47.359
Caption: everybody and it&#39;s really really cool so

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:49.679
Caption: this is neuroplasticity in action right

01:14:47.359 --> 01:14:52.080
Caption: so if we strengthen that neural pathway

01:14:49.679 --> 01:14:54.640
Caption: and we stimulate it over and over and

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.080
Caption: over again then we start to learn things

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:59.280
Caption: if the stimulus is strong enough or

01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.760
Caption: repetitive enough it will stick

01:14:59.279 --> 01:15:01.759
Caption: also

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.839
Caption: if we stop the stimulus

01:15:07.919 --> 01:15:12.479
Caption: those neural pathways will dissolve

01:15:11.279 --> 01:15:14.559
Caption: right

01:15:12.479 --> 01:15:16.080
Caption: so think about it it makes sense that

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.959
Caption: just reading a book about emotional

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:21.439
Caption: intelligence or memory it&#39;s not going to

01:15:18.959 --> 01:15:24.080
Caption: instantly improve you have to actually

01:15:21.439 --> 01:15:26.799
Caption: practice these things over and over and

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.800
Caption: over again or the stimulus has to be

01:15:26.799 --> 01:15:31.359
Caption: strong enough ladies and gentlemen

01:15:28.799 --> 01:15:32.559
Caption: imagine teeny tiny little christina i

01:15:31.359 --> 01:15:34.879
Caption: take you back

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:36.959
Caption: you know 40 some years ago crawling

01:15:34.879 --> 01:15:39.520
Caption: around the floor of my grandmother&#39;s

01:15:36.959 --> 01:15:42.399
Caption: house and in the u.s we have um we have

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:45.120
Caption: 110 volts but you know what this this i

01:15:42.399 --> 01:15:47.198
Caption: i think you get the picture we are uh

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:48.719
Caption: looking at me crawling around my

01:15:47.199 --> 01:15:51.120
Caption: grandmother&#39;s house and i pick up one of

01:15:48.719 --> 01:15:53.440
Caption: those metal hairpins

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.600
Caption: and it happens to be the perfect size

01:15:53.439 --> 01:15:55.600
Caption: for

01:15:57.199 --> 01:16:01.199
Caption: crying crying oh my gosh

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.439
Caption: it bit me

01:16:01.199 --> 01:16:05.199
Caption: it bit me right my mom had no idea what

01:16:03.439 --> 01:16:07.040
Caption: bitter because we didn&#39;t have dogs we

01:16:05.199 --> 01:16:08.719
Caption: didn&#39;t like what was it what bit her i

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.120
Caption: had no no

01:16:08.719 --> 01:16:13.679
Caption: it bit me and then she realized that i&#39;d

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:16.719
Caption: stick the bobby pin into

01:16:13.679 --> 01:16:18.560
Caption: the socket how many times do you think i

01:16:16.719 --> 01:16:20.640
Caption: stimulated that narrow pathway in my

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.239
Caption: life

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.880
Caption: once

01:16:22.238 --> 01:16:26.879
Caption: once that was all that was needed for me

01:16:24.879 --> 01:16:29.120
Caption: to learn the lesson if the stimulus is

01:16:26.879 --> 01:16:30.718
Caption: strong enough or repetitive enough

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.840
Caption: you will

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:36.800
Caption: remember it and also neuroplasticity

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:38.799
Caption: just as we will remember it we can

01:16:36.799 --> 01:16:40.799
Caption: forget it so my french teacher used to

01:16:38.799 --> 01:16:42.559
Caption: say if you don&#39;t use it

01:16:40.799 --> 01:16:44.479
Caption: you lose it

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:48.560
Caption: that&#39;s why the only thing i can say in

01:16:44.479 --> 01:16:51.040
Caption: french is escotu uncravat

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:54.800
Caption: are you a thai

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.799
Caption: it&#39;s completely useless i don&#39;t know

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:01.439
Caption: three years of french it&#39;s unbelievable

01:16:58.238 --> 01:17:02.799
Caption: and so we we went through the different

01:17:01.439 --> 01:17:05.759
Caption: kinds of

01:17:02.799 --> 01:17:08.319
Caption: memory subsystems we we talked about the

01:17:05.759 --> 01:17:10.479
Caption: the value of neuroplasticity we talked

01:17:08.319 --> 01:17:12.319
Caption: about how

01:17:10.479 --> 01:17:15.199
Caption: memories can be false let&#39;s talk a

01:17:12.319 --> 01:17:17.678
Caption: little bit about how we can process our

01:17:15.199 --> 01:17:20.159
Caption: memories

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:22.719
Caption: we have shallow processing superficial

01:17:20.159 --> 01:17:25.120
Caption: or deep where we have that purpose

01:17:22.719 --> 01:17:27.199
Caption: attached to the data when we have

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:29.520
Caption: something that&#39;s meaningful to us now

01:17:27.199 --> 01:17:31.280
Caption: remember there are 7.9 billion different

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:33.359
Caption: ways to do this and that means

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:35.439
Caption: introverts and extroverts are going to

01:17:33.359 --> 01:17:36.799
Caption: respond to the same stimuli in a

01:17:35.439 --> 01:17:38.799
Caption: different way

01:17:36.799 --> 01:17:40.879
Caption: if you are in teams we need to

01:17:38.799 --> 01:17:44.079
Caption: understand this and we need to take this

01:17:40.879 --> 01:17:46.639
Caption: into consideration uh devnekema put up a

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.959
Caption: really great twitter post that she said

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.800
Caption: i could use as i was putting as i was

01:17:48.959 --> 01:17:52.319
Caption: putting my talk together front load the

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:54.158
Caption: data

01:17:52.319 --> 01:17:56.639
Caption: front load me with information give me

01:17:54.159 --> 01:17:59.120
Caption: time to process and respond i&#39;m not an

01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:01.600
Caption: on the spot thinker but give me time

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.320
Caption: to be thoughtful and it&#39;s worth the wait

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.840
Caption: give me reference material make

01:18:03.319 --> 01:18:07.759
Caption: asynchronous collaboration possible my

01:18:05.839 --> 01:18:08.799
Caption: brain&#39;s not always lit up and ready for

01:18:07.759 --> 01:18:11.599
Caption: output

01:18:08.799 --> 01:18:13.599
Caption: allow me to communicate in text that&#39;s a

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.359
Caption: big one for me that&#39;s a really big one

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.959
Caption: for me because is anybody else really

01:18:15.359 --> 01:18:20.080
Caption: good like you go home and like oh i

01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:21.919

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.919
Caption: oh that&#39;s smart ass i should have gave

01:18:21.919 --> 01:18:25.600

Caption: right

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:30.159
Caption: oh i had the perfect response four days

01:18:28.399 --> 01:18:31.839
Caption: later like the other person&#39;s not even

01:18:30.159 --> 01:18:33.439
Caption: thinking about the conversation anymore

01:18:31.839 --> 01:18:35.279
Caption: you know

01:18:33.439 --> 01:18:38.080
Caption: real-time meetings are allowed to

01:18:35.279 --> 01:18:40.079
Caption: process at once and i&#39;m already short on

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.679
Caption: working memory i&#39;m probably bored and

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.959
Caption: it&#39;s taking everything i have just to

01:18:41.679 --> 01:18:45.120
Caption: stay focused and listen for

01:18:42.959 --> 01:18:48.159
Caption: understanding this is especially true

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:51.840
Caption: during covid times here is a summary of

01:18:48.159 --> 01:18:51.840
Caption: what devnekema has to say

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:55.520
Caption: understanding this it helps us support

01:18:54.319 --> 01:18:58.319
Caption: everyone

01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.799
Caption: on the team so that everyone can perform

01:18:58.319 --> 01:19:02.319
Caption: better on the job if you are going to

01:19:00.799 --> 01:19:04.959
Caption: come right out of the gate and be like

01:19:02.319 --> 01:19:06.399
Caption: hey everybody all right let&#39;s go let&#39;s

01:19:04.959 --> 01:19:08.959
Caption: get this meeting started right

01:19:06.399 --> 01:19:10.799
Caption: extroverts are gonna go yeah let&#39;s go

01:19:08.959 --> 01:19:12.879
Caption: this is awesome

01:19:10.799 --> 01:19:14.799
Caption: i got ideas we&#39;re gonna start talking

01:19:12.879 --> 01:19:16.399
Caption: over each other oh i got some creative

01:19:14.799 --> 01:19:18.718
Caption: things let&#39;s go and all of the

01:19:16.399 --> 01:19:20.158
Caption: introverts are gonna go

01:19:18.719 --> 01:19:23.640
Caption: i guess it&#39;s gonna be one of those

01:19:20.159 --> 01:19:23.640
Caption: meetings again

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:30.959
Caption: they&#39;re going to check out

01:19:28.719 --> 01:19:34.719
Caption: they&#39;re going to sit back

01:19:30.959 --> 01:19:34.718
Caption: and quietly resent you

01:19:35.439 --> 01:19:39.120
Caption: and they&#39;re gonna wait for the big

01:19:36.959 --> 01:19:42.080
Caption: moment two months later

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:43.919
Caption: when the poop hits the fan

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:46.800
Caption: and they&#39;re gonna say

01:19:43.919 --> 01:19:50.560
Caption: i told you so

01:19:46.799 --> 01:19:52.238
Caption: i told you two months ago

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:54.479
Caption: because they respond to the same exact

01:19:52.238 --> 01:19:56.079
Caption: stimuli in different ways and we need to

01:19:54.479 --> 01:19:59.040
Caption: understand this and this is why we have

01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:01.199
Caption: to have all types of communication and

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:02.399
Caption: and facilitation during during our

01:20:01.199 --> 01:20:04.400
Caption: meeting so

01:20:02.399 --> 01:20:06.959
Caption: let&#39;s talk about encoding memories

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:09.439
Caption: ways that we encode

01:20:06.959 --> 01:20:11.679
Caption: our memories

01:20:09.439 --> 01:20:13.919
Caption: our focus right you train your brain to

01:20:11.679 --> 01:20:16.239
Caption: recognize patterns for example you might

01:20:13.919 --> 01:20:18.399
Caption: want to think about

01:20:16.238 --> 01:20:20.479
Caption: trying to recognize somebody in a happy

01:20:18.399 --> 01:20:22.319
Caption: cheerful moment and then the next day

01:20:20.479 --> 01:20:24.399
Caption: two happy cheerful moments and then the

01:20:22.319 --> 01:20:26.079
Caption: next day three happy cheerful moments

01:20:24.399 --> 01:20:27.279
Caption: and then the next day four happy

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:29.120
Caption: cheerful moments because you know what

01:20:27.279 --> 01:20:30.718
Caption: we are really good at finding the not so

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:34.000
Caption: good moments we don&#39;t need that that&#39;s

01:20:30.719 --> 01:20:36.159
Caption: already implicit in our brain looking

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.279
Caption: and scanning for threats so think about

01:20:36.159 --> 01:20:40.560
Caption: what your focus is remember the popcorn

01:20:39.279 --> 01:20:42.000
Caption: eating

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.600
Caption: while watching the movie and eating

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.080
Caption: popcorn was your friend and then you&#39;re

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:47.760
Caption: like oh sorry joy um but what&#39;s your

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:50.560
Caption: focus

01:20:47.759 --> 01:20:53.759
Caption: next you can also train your brain um

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:55.359
Caption: with a slow and low

01:20:53.759 --> 01:20:57.519
Caption: oh

01:20:55.359 --> 01:20:59.759
Caption: let&#39;s try it right now right slow and

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.760
Caption: low

01:21:05.679 --> 01:21:10.479
Caption: so these small intentional changes

01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:12.880
Caption: that&#39;s how big changes are made and when

01:21:10.479 --> 01:21:15.199
Caption: we have a relaxed nervous system we are

01:21:12.879 --> 01:21:17.520
Caption: going to be able to take in information

01:21:15.199 --> 01:21:20.960
Caption: a whole lot better we can create our own

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:23.279
Caption: opportunities we can create our own

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:23.279
Caption: luck

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:29.600
Caption: we can improve our encoding

01:21:27.359 --> 01:21:31.600
Caption: through a technique

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:33.840
Caption: that&#39;s called the memory card technique

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:36.959
Caption: i&#39;m from las vegas we love to play cards

01:21:33.839 --> 01:21:38.959
Caption: in vegas so you take some cards you lay

01:21:36.959 --> 01:21:40.718
Caption: them all out and you can try to remember

01:21:38.959 --> 01:21:43.439
Caption: them you can do things like try to

01:21:40.719 --> 01:21:45.199
Caption: remember the order of the 52 deck of

01:21:43.439 --> 01:21:47.359
Caption: cards you can do things like try to

01:21:45.199 --> 01:21:49.760
Caption: remember all of the cards that have a

01:21:47.359 --> 01:21:52.399
Caption: white background you can remember all of

01:21:49.759 --> 01:21:54.479
Caption: the black cards all of the red cards and

01:21:52.399 --> 01:21:55.520
Caption: as you do this over and over and over

01:21:54.479 --> 01:21:56.399
Caption: again what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.520
Caption: training

01:21:56.399 --> 01:22:00.959
Caption: your brain to encode data better and

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:03.600
Caption: faster

01:22:00.959 --> 01:22:06.319
Caption: you can also do this through action this

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:08.479
Caption: boosts our episodic memory encoding

01:22:06.319 --> 01:22:10.799
Caption: because it releases noradrenaline and so

01:22:08.479 --> 01:22:11.759
Caption: if you&#39;ve got a wobbly kid like me

01:22:10.799 --> 01:22:14.158
Caption: right

01:22:11.759 --> 01:22:15.039
Caption: when they&#39;re studying give them a wobble

01:22:14.159 --> 01:22:16.159
Caption: cushion

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.199
Caption: because they&#39;re going to wiggle at

01:22:16.159 --> 01:22:19.920
Caption: school

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:22.400
Caption: and so we&#39;ll this is how we get a lot of

01:22:19.919 --> 01:22:24.718
Caption: like active learning right and and

01:22:22.399 --> 01:22:27.120
Caption: different types of seats in classrooms

01:22:24.719 --> 01:22:29.360
Caption: that the teachers these days uh are

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:32.159
Caption: always advocating for right a more

01:22:29.359 --> 01:22:34.080
Caption: experiential active learning environment

01:22:32.159 --> 01:22:36.320
Caption: is going to be a lot more helpful for

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:38.959
Caption: many learners here&#39;s a new one this is

01:22:36.319 --> 01:22:40.479
Caption: in you can improve your coding by the

01:22:38.959 --> 01:22:42.959
Caption: shoot the thumb technique who has heard

01:22:40.479 --> 01:22:45.120
Caption: of this one shoot the thumb technique is

01:22:42.959 --> 01:22:47.279
Caption: awesome and i&#39;m gonna really embarrass

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:49.840
Caption: myself okay here we go uh shoot the

01:22:47.279 --> 01:22:51.119
Caption: thumb technique you gotta shoot

01:22:49.839 --> 01:22:53.359
Caption: your thumb

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:54.639
Caption: here we go all right i got it okay i&#39;m

01:22:53.359 --> 01:22:55.919
Caption: gonna shoot my thumb all right so you

01:22:54.639 --> 01:22:59.600
Caption: shoot your thumb

01:22:55.919 --> 01:23:01.600
Caption: while you are holding on to a memory and

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:03.760
Caption: the cool part about this is you get

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:07.280
Caption: bilateral stimulation of both

01:23:03.759 --> 01:23:10.559
Caption: hemispheres of your brain and as this

01:23:07.279 --> 01:23:13.839
Caption: information goes across your brain by

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:16.879
Caption: lateral across your hemispheres you are

01:23:13.839 --> 01:23:19.279
Caption: oh look i&#39;m talking okay

01:23:16.879 --> 01:23:21.839
Caption: you can

01:23:19.279 --> 01:23:24.238
Caption: have other data transfer across those

01:23:21.839 --> 01:23:27.198
Caption: neural pathways it&#39;s not just that one

01:23:24.238 --> 01:23:30.000
Caption: memory that&#39;s held and so it&#39;s a really

01:23:27.199 --> 01:23:34.400
Caption: effective teaching strategy um

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Caption: for for helping to improve encoding

01:23:34.399 --> 01:23:37.678
Caption: um

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.679
Caption: let&#39;s see

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:44.159
Caption: shoot the thumb transmitting data yes oh

01:23:41.679 --> 01:23:46.639
Caption: spacing effect the spacing effect is one

01:23:44.159 --> 01:23:48.719
Caption: that i use for my for my pub conf talks

01:23:46.639 --> 01:23:50.800
Caption: any of my ignite talks those five

01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:53.600
Caption: minutes super fast talk i did this with

01:23:50.799 --> 01:23:57.119
Caption: my tedx talk when i did that one you can

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:58.560
Caption: um read your talk or your list

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.320
Caption: and then

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:02.000
Caption: say it out loud when you&#39;re saying it

01:24:00.319 --> 01:24:04.479
Caption: out loud you&#39;re feeling your vocal cords

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.479
Caption: you&#39;re hearing yourself do it you&#39;re

01:24:04.479 --> 01:24:09.520
Caption: feeling you&#39;re writing it on the paper

01:24:06.479 --> 01:24:12.399
Caption: not just typing it out right and then

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:14.879
Caption: read your list again or you talk again

01:24:12.399 --> 01:24:17.040
Caption: go to sleep you get take advantage of

01:24:14.879 --> 01:24:18.479
Caption: that that memory consolidation technique

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.399
Caption: that we talked about earlier right

01:24:18.479 --> 01:24:22.159
Caption: remember and then when you wake up and

01:24:20.399 --> 01:24:24.560
Caption: you repeat it the next day you&#39;re going

01:24:22.159 --> 01:24:26.560
Caption: to significantly remember that

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:28.719
Caption: information this is a very very

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:31.439
Caption: effective technique

01:24:28.719 --> 01:24:33.440
Caption: the other thing you can do is relax you

01:24:31.439 --> 01:24:35.919
Caption: can improve your memory recording by

01:24:33.439 --> 01:24:38.399
Caption: encoding by relaxing again this allows

01:24:35.919 --> 01:24:40.158
Caption: the neurotransmitter vasopressin um to

01:24:38.399 --> 01:24:42.080
Caption: be released and that makes us much more

01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:45.040
Caption: open to receiving

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:49.679
Caption: information right so you can take a nice

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:53.040
Caption: big breath and you can relax so here is

01:24:49.679 --> 01:24:54.880
Caption: a summary of how we can improve in

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:56.639
Caption: coding if you just take one of these

01:24:54.879 --> 01:24:58.959
Caption: techniques and practice it every single

01:24:56.639 --> 01:25:02.719
Caption: day for three months i promise you you

01:24:58.959 --> 01:25:02.718
Caption: will improve your memory encoding

01:25:03.439 --> 01:25:09.919
Caption: let&#39;s talk about storing our memories

01:25:06.799 --> 01:25:12.000
Caption: we can use our senses sight sound smell

01:25:09.919 --> 01:25:13.600
Caption: touch taste we have a sense of agency we

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.639
Caption: have a sense of blushing a sense of

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:16.639
Caption: hunger

01:25:14.639 --> 01:25:18.959
Caption: a sense of time

01:25:16.639 --> 01:25:21.280
Caption: the more that we can

01:25:18.959 --> 01:25:22.718
Caption: incorporate those the more we&#39;re going

01:25:21.279 --> 01:25:25.279
Caption: to remember it right so for example

01:25:22.719 --> 01:25:27.360
Caption: think about you you have songs

01:25:25.279 --> 01:25:29.279
Caption: that put you right back into that moment

01:25:27.359 --> 01:25:30.799
Caption: right i think about uh

01:25:29.279 --> 01:25:32.638
Caption: the rolling stones i think about i can&#39;t

01:25:30.799 --> 01:25:34.399
Caption: get no satisfaction it takes me right

01:25:32.639 --> 01:25:36.560
Caption: back to that time

01:25:34.399 --> 01:25:38.718
Caption: like cruising in the car with the

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:41.520
Caption: windows down and the hair i was like so

01:25:38.719 --> 01:25:44.080
Caption: young and free right like we all have

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:47.439
Caption: certain songs

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:49.839
Caption: that mean something to us because of the

01:25:47.439 --> 01:25:52.718
Caption: way that we&#39;ve stored those memories

01:25:49.839 --> 01:25:54.638
Caption: here&#39;s the thing about senses

01:25:52.719 --> 01:25:57.360
Caption: they can be tricked

01:25:54.639 --> 01:26:00.719
Caption: right you add a shadow and suddenly it

01:25:57.359 --> 01:26:04.718
Caption: creates an illusion so you can&#39;t depend

01:26:00.719 --> 01:26:04.719
Caption: just on one of your senses

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:11.840
Caption: storytelling storytelling is another way

01:26:07.679 --> 01:26:14.080
Caption: that we can really remember things our

01:26:11.839 --> 01:26:16.560
Caption: as humans we love stories we love

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:18.719
Caption: stories i grew up in the midwest on the

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:20.879
Caption: shores of lake superior and my uncles

01:26:18.719 --> 01:26:22.719
Caption: they used to tell the grandest stories

01:26:20.879 --> 01:26:25.198
Caption: of that fish they caught

01:26:22.719 --> 01:26:27.600
Caption: and every time they told the story the

01:26:25.199 --> 01:26:29.920
Caption: the fish would get a little bit bigger

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:31.359
Caption: and a little bit bigger and a little bit

01:26:29.919 --> 01:26:32.238
Caption: bigger and before you know it&#39;d be like

01:26:31.359 --> 01:26:34.080
Caption: hey

01:26:32.238 --> 01:26:36.238
Caption: remember that time when you caught that

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:38.000
Caption: big fish yeah and then everybody knows

01:26:36.238 --> 01:26:41.439
Caption: the story and we&#39;ve all heard it so many

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:44.639
Caption: times so storytelling is another way to

01:26:41.439 --> 01:26:46.959
Caption: help with your memory storage our

01:26:44.639 --> 01:26:49.679
Caption: hippocampus is the way

01:26:46.959 --> 01:26:52.000
Caption: is the place in our brain that stores it

01:26:49.679 --> 01:26:53.440
Caption: and of course you know any of that

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.959
Caption: bilateral

01:26:53.439 --> 01:26:57.198
Caption: thinking

01:26:54.959 --> 01:26:59.439
Caption: is going to help any of that bilateral

01:26:57.199 --> 01:27:02.560
Caption: stuff because what we know is that our

01:26:59.439 --> 01:27:06.238
Caption: brains store things in chunks we love

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:08.000
Caption: chunks this is why we do things like uh

01:27:06.238 --> 01:27:08.879
Caption: we do phone numbers who&#39;s done this

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.120
Caption: before

01:27:08.879 --> 01:27:12.399
Caption: okay yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s trade numbers cool

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.679
Caption: all right yeah all right you get your

01:27:12.399 --> 01:27:15.359
Caption: paper out

01:27:13.679 --> 01:27:18.239
Caption: you get your pen you&#39;re ready to go okay

01:27:15.359 --> 01:27:20.560
Caption: go ahead i&#39;m i&#39;m ready all right it&#39;s

01:27:18.238 --> 01:27:22.399
Caption: 172

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:25.439
Caption: 2 2 2

01:27:22.399 --> 01:27:26.718
Caption: 21 20 wait wait wait wait wait okay no

01:27:25.439 --> 01:27:29.279
Caption: your phone number yeah that is my phone

01:27:26.719 --> 01:27:31.090
Caption: number okay it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s

01:27:29.279 --> 01:27:33.439
Caption: 1722

01:27:31.089 --> 01:27:36.319
Caption: [Music]

01:27:33.439 --> 01:27:38.639
Caption: and then we&#39;re going to do oh 15 no just

01:27:36.319 --> 01:27:40.560
Caption: give it to me like a human and not a

01:27:38.639 --> 01:27:43.199
Caption: psychopath okay would that be all right

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:48.159
Caption: with you listen it&#39;s the cadence it&#39;s

01:27:43.199 --> 01:27:51.520
Caption: the tone we like to chunk data it&#39;s one

01:27:48.159 --> 01:27:53.679
Caption: seven zero two two two two one five one

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:56.319
Caption: five everybody knows

01:27:53.679 --> 01:27:58.719
Caption: you like the chunks right we like chunks

01:27:56.319 --> 01:28:01.678
Caption: of data and so that is how you can

01:27:58.719 --> 01:28:04.400
Caption: improve your memory storage some basic

01:28:01.679 --> 01:28:07.199
Caption: influencing factors and so we could do

01:28:04.399 --> 01:28:09.600
Caption: things like uh meditate

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:12.239
Caption: right i meditated this morning sat down

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:12.239
Caption: and did a little

01:28:12.319 --> 01:28:16.158
Caption: just before we got on because i&#39;d like

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:19.359
Caption: to be nice and relaxed it&#39;s going to

01:28:16.159 --> 01:28:21.360
Caption: help us improve our learning our our

01:28:19.359 --> 01:28:24.080
Caption: capacity for empathy

01:28:21.359 --> 01:28:27.040
Caption: and our memory after just eight

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:29.919
Caption: weeks of meditating even if you&#39;ve never

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:32.239
Caption: even meditated before our brains will

01:28:29.919 --> 01:28:34.319
Caption: have more gray matter and development in

01:28:32.238 --> 01:28:35.519
Caption: those areas the other thing that we can

01:28:34.319 --> 01:28:38.399
Caption: do

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.159
Caption: is get in touch with our feelings

01:28:38.399 --> 01:28:42.158
Caption: if we get in touch with our feelings and

01:28:40.159 --> 01:28:44.080
Caption: our emotions we&#39;re going to remember

01:28:42.159 --> 01:28:47.040
Caption: more remember emotions are what drive

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:48.080
Caption: that narrative and so that is going to

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.399
Caption: uh

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:53.679
Caption: have a positive or it can have a

01:28:50.399 --> 01:28:55.198
Caption: negative right effect on inhib

01:28:53.679 --> 01:28:57.920
Caption: inhibiting or

01:28:55.199 --> 01:29:01.600
Caption: prohibiting those neurotransmitters to

01:28:57.919 --> 01:29:03.759
Caption: accurate activate parts of our brain so

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:04.959
Caption: taken to the extreme if you&#39;re too

01:29:03.759 --> 01:29:06.799
Caption: emotional

01:29:04.959 --> 01:29:08.639
Caption: then you might need to work a little bit

01:29:06.799 --> 01:29:10.238
Caption: on your your psychological boundaries

01:29:08.639 --> 01:29:12.800
Caption: with people right so get in touch with

01:29:10.238 --> 01:29:14.158
Caption: your feelings

01:29:12.799 --> 01:29:16.799
Caption: here&#39;s the other thing you can do is

01:29:14.159 --> 01:29:19.520
Caption: association for example putting on your

01:29:16.799 --> 01:29:21.198
Caption: favorite hoodie or or or attaching that

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.199
Caption: new information to something that&#39;s

01:29:21.199 --> 01:29:24.880
Caption: already in there i do a workshop about

01:29:23.199 --> 01:29:27.679
Caption: this where we actually do practice

01:29:24.879 --> 01:29:30.158
Caption: things and we build a memory palace and

01:29:27.679 --> 01:29:33.600
Caption: i show you exactly how to associate

01:29:30.159 --> 01:29:37.120
Caption: certain memories with certain things in

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:38.719
Caption: in that&#39;s already being retained

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:42.239
Caption: the other thing we can do is we can

01:29:38.719 --> 01:29:45.760
Caption: create chaos and you can break habits

01:29:42.238 --> 01:29:47.359
Caption: where you&#39;re not really actually

01:29:45.759 --> 01:29:50.158
Caption: uh they&#39;re not actually serving you

01:29:47.359 --> 01:29:52.560
Caption: anymore instead you know sometimes we

01:29:50.159 --> 01:29:55.199
Caption: just have information in there and we

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:57.839
Caption: just do it just because so there&#39;s the

01:29:55.199 --> 01:29:59.840
Caption: the story of the the thanksgiving dinner

01:29:57.839 --> 01:30:01.919
Caption: or the christmas dinner and the mom is

01:29:59.839 --> 01:30:03.359
Caption: preparing it she&#39;s showing her daughter

01:30:01.919 --> 01:30:05.279
Caption: how to how to make the ham and how to

01:30:03.359 --> 01:30:07.040
Caption: cook it okay cool so she takes it she

01:30:05.279 --> 01:30:09.039
Caption: puts all the seasonings on it and she

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:10.879
Caption: she sets it down and she whacks it in

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:12.799
Caption: half and she puts it in two pans and

01:30:10.879 --> 01:30:14.080
Caption: then she puts it in the oven

01:30:12.799 --> 01:30:16.079
Caption: the daughter goes

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:18.320
Caption: that&#39;s great mama why do we whack it in

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.839
Caption: half like what&#39;s she i don&#39;t know that&#39;s

01:30:18.319 --> 01:30:21.759
Caption: just the recipe that&#39;s how our family

01:30:19.839 --> 01:30:23.919
Caption: does it that&#39;s what grandma always said

01:30:21.759 --> 01:30:26.000
Caption: and she goes to grandma and she says hey

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:29.040
Caption: how come we cut the ham in half what&#39;s

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.719
Caption: what and she said oh well we just never

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:32.719
Caption: had a pan big enough so yes

01:30:32.879 --> 01:30:36.799
Caption: so think about why you&#39;re doing things

01:30:34.719 --> 01:30:38.719
Caption: don&#39;t just put things onto autopilot

01:30:36.799 --> 01:30:40.559
Caption: over and over again we can improve our

01:30:38.719 --> 01:30:42.239
Caption: storage through repetition remember if

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.760
Caption: the stimulus is strong enough or

01:30:42.238 --> 01:30:45.599
Caption: repetitive enough

01:30:43.759 --> 01:30:47.759
Caption: right you can strengthen those neural

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:50.159
Caption: pathways you get more protein synthesis

01:30:47.759 --> 01:30:52.638
Caption: the myelinated sheaths get bigger

01:30:50.159 --> 01:30:54.959
Caption: we get more bundles more narrow pathways

01:30:52.639 --> 01:30:58.400
Caption: in fact um through

01:30:54.959 --> 01:30:59.759
Caption: that uh memory subsystem and so

01:30:58.399 --> 01:31:01.520
Caption: it&#39;s estimated in marketing and

01:30:59.759 --> 01:31:04.559
Caption: advertising in my world that somebody

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:08.479
Caption: needs to see something 21 times before

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:10.800
Caption: it before it sticks into our skulls and

01:31:08.479 --> 01:31:13.279
Caption: so you know we&#39;re exposed to that same

01:31:10.799 --> 01:31:14.879
Caption: messaging over and over and over again

01:31:13.279 --> 01:31:17.279
Caption: you could see how this would be positive

01:31:14.879 --> 01:31:19.120
Caption: you could see also how this might be be

01:31:17.279 --> 01:31:20.959
Caption: harmful as well

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:23.199
Caption: we can improve storage by better

01:31:20.959 --> 01:31:24.879
Caption: documentation we see this in tech right

01:31:23.199 --> 01:31:27.760
Caption: we can make

01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:31.198
Caption: documentation about why choices are made

01:31:27.759 --> 01:31:34.238
Caption: and also why not choices were made

01:31:31.199 --> 01:31:36.000
Caption: because if we right now

01:31:34.238 --> 01:31:38.158
Caption: say we&#39;re not this isn&#39;t going to work

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.600
Caption: for us if we write why

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:42.479
Caption: two years down the road funding might

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:44.959
Caption: become available right so maybe we can

01:31:42.479 --> 01:31:46.399
Caption: change that decision and it&#39;s documented

01:31:44.959 --> 01:31:49.198
Caption: right there instead of everybody going

01:31:46.399 --> 01:31:51.120
Caption: hmm now why did we do this why didn&#39;t we

01:31:49.199 --> 01:31:53.120
Caption: do that i&#39;m not sure

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:55.520
Caption: the project manager&#39;s gone sales team is

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:57.040
Caption: long gone and nobody really understands

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:59.359
Caption: why those those

01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:02.799
Caption: choices and decisions were made we can

01:31:59.359 --> 01:32:05.279
Caption: also improve our storage by facilitating

01:32:02.799 --> 01:32:06.238
Caption: our meetings better remember

01:32:05.279 --> 01:32:08.638
Caption: somebody

01:32:06.238 --> 01:32:10.638
Caption: if they bring an idea to the table for

01:32:08.639 --> 01:32:12.320
Caption: example and then two months later

01:32:10.639 --> 01:32:14.560
Caption: somebody brings up that same idea they

01:32:12.319 --> 01:32:17.119
Caption: go hey let&#39;s do this

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:18.959
Caption: yeah i think that was a great idea that

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:20.719
Caption: was a great idea two months ago when i

01:32:18.959 --> 01:32:24.399
Caption: brought it up

01:32:20.719 --> 01:32:27.040
Caption: but your focus wasn&#39;t on the who

01:32:24.399 --> 01:32:30.000
Caption: because instead you were focused on on

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:31.919
Caption: the what so we can improve storage by

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.279
Caption: you know having better facilitated

01:32:31.919 --> 01:32:34.718
Caption: meetings

01:32:33.279 --> 01:32:36.799
Caption: and the last thing for improving storage

01:32:34.719 --> 01:32:38.840
Caption: i must mention is the von restore for

01:32:36.799 --> 01:32:42.559
Caption: effect this

01:32:38.839 --> 01:32:44.638
Caption: is the things that are unique are going

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:47.280
Caption: to stand out and be remembered the most

01:32:44.639 --> 01:32:49.199
Caption: so i worked in a hotel during my uh

01:32:47.279 --> 01:32:52.238
Caption: college years in the summer and there

01:32:49.199 --> 01:32:54.400
Caption: was a police officer there with his dog

01:32:52.238 --> 01:32:56.638
Caption: partner and they were they were training

01:32:54.399 --> 01:32:58.158
Caption: and he was staying in the hotel and

01:32:56.639 --> 01:32:59.919
Caption: he and another officer were sitting

01:32:58.159 --> 01:33:01.520
Caption: there in the lobby one night and we were

01:32:59.919 --> 01:33:02.799
Caption: all talking and they were making fun of

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:04.000
Caption: me because they&#39;re like oh yeah your

01:33:02.799 --> 01:33:06.879
Caption: white car

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.719
Caption: you better stop speeding because i i see

01:33:06.879 --> 01:33:10.479
Caption: white cars better right and the other

01:33:08.719 --> 01:33:13.440
Caption: police officer he was like no i actually

01:33:10.479 --> 01:33:16.399
Caption: see red cars better because they stand

01:33:13.439 --> 01:33:19.359
Caption: out to me more and so he gave more

01:33:16.399 --> 01:33:21.678
Caption: tickets to to cars that were red cars as

01:33:19.359 --> 01:33:23.279
Caption: opposed to any other color of cars and

01:33:21.679 --> 01:33:25.199
Caption: and that&#39;s the

01:33:23.279 --> 01:33:27.759
Caption: restore for effect so we can take

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:29.760
Caption: advantage of things that maybe

01:33:27.759 --> 01:33:32.879
Caption: are a little bit more unique and they&#39;re

01:33:29.759 --> 01:33:34.238
Caption: you&#39;re going to uniquely stand out

01:33:32.879 --> 01:33:37.839
Caption: here is

01:33:34.238 --> 01:33:37.839
Caption: a summary of that

01:33:38.959 --> 01:33:43.198
Caption: and so the last one

01:33:40.799 --> 01:33:45.599
Caption: i want to talk about how we retrieve our

01:33:43.199 --> 01:33:48.719
Caption: memories and so um something that

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:50.479
Caption: influences uh that you know is tolving

01:33:48.719 --> 01:33:52.320
Caption: he&#39;s the one who

01:33:50.479 --> 01:33:54.479
Caption: he proposed that that forgetting

01:33:52.319 --> 01:33:57.718
Caption: oftentimes is just a matter of memory

01:33:54.479 --> 01:34:02.000
Caption: retrieval and so i think this was

01:33:57.719 --> 01:34:04.159
Caption: 1983 yeah so this is when like um you

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.120
Caption: have that actor&#39;s name on the tip of

01:34:04.159 --> 01:34:07.520
Caption: your tongue

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.360
Caption: and it&#39;s right there you know he&#39;s that

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:11.760
Caption: guy with the head the two worms he was

01:34:09.359 --> 01:34:14.560
Caption: in that show with the with the person

01:34:11.759 --> 01:34:16.479
Caption: right that&#39;s that&#39;s what the he&#39;s

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:19.120
Caption: referring to when we start talking about

01:34:16.479 --> 01:34:21.120
Caption: memory retrieval and so another example

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:22.959
Caption: i do this i walk into my kitchen and i

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:24.560
Caption: go

01:34:22.959 --> 01:34:27.359
Caption: hmm

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:29.280
Caption: what the hell come in here floral what

01:34:27.359 --> 01:34:32.799
Caption: am i right and so what do we do we

01:34:29.279 --> 01:34:35.039
Caption: backtrack we associate what we were

01:34:32.799 --> 01:34:36.879
Caption: thinking and and how

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.520
Caption: so we can retrieve those memories give

01:34:36.879 --> 01:34:42.080
Caption: it a cue give it a prompt and then we

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:44.639
Caption: can move forward so one way that we can

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:46.560
Caption: improve our memory retrieval is we can

01:34:44.639 --> 01:34:48.800
Caption: use the same method

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:51.919
Caption: so different cues help us manage our

01:34:48.799 --> 01:34:54.079
Caption: mindset and so uh we can improve our

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:57.120
Caption: memory retrieval by matching and

01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:59.199
Caption: encoding uh the the matching the

01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:01.760
Caption: encoding and the retrieval cues right

01:34:59.199 --> 01:35:03.440
Caption: and if you use that same method every

01:35:01.759 --> 01:35:05.919
Caption: single time like sometimes people will

01:35:03.439 --> 01:35:08.000
Caption: say all right i use the same method for

01:35:05.919 --> 01:35:10.080
Caption: creating a password

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.560
Caption: then it helps you remember the password

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:14.320
Caption: without even having to remember 4 000

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:17.359
Caption: passwords all the time and it also helps

01:35:14.319 --> 01:35:20.319
Caption: you as you change those passwords right

01:35:17.359 --> 01:35:23.678
Caption: you can also do intentional recall your

01:35:20.319 --> 01:35:25.599
Caption: mood and other biases you know there

01:35:23.679 --> 01:35:26.719
Caption: whatever is in that moment they&#39;re gonna

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:29.199
Caption: influence

01:35:26.719 --> 01:35:30.800
Caption: the information that you recall so if

01:35:29.199 --> 01:35:32.239
Caption: you want to intro improve your memory

01:35:30.799 --> 01:35:34.559
Caption: retrieval

01:35:32.238 --> 01:35:37.678
Caption: consider that mindset that you&#39;re that

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:40.800
Caption: you&#39;re in and then you know move forward

01:35:37.679 --> 01:35:43.840
Caption: with intentional recall intentional

01:35:40.799 --> 01:35:45.678
Caption: recall is then how we teach that

01:35:43.839 --> 01:35:47.520
Caption: information to people

01:35:45.679 --> 01:35:49.520
Caption: right if we

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:52.239
Caption: feed it back to somebody this is what i

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:53.520
Caption: learned then we are going to be much

01:35:52.238 --> 01:35:56.158
Caption: more

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:59.919
Caption: able to retrieve memories in the future

01:35:56.159 --> 01:36:02.320
Caption: we&#39;re training our brain to think that

01:35:59.919 --> 01:36:04.080
Caption: way so consider maybe how the

01:36:02.319 --> 01:36:05.439
Caption: information could be applied to your

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:08.719
Caption: work that you&#39;ve learned in the

01:36:05.439 --> 01:36:10.479
Caption: conference this uh this afternoon right

01:36:08.719 --> 01:36:11.600
Caption: think about um

01:36:10.479 --> 01:36:12.479
Caption: how

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:15.679
Caption: maybe

01:36:12.479 --> 01:36:17.600
Caption: you are going to long-term store

01:36:15.679 --> 01:36:20.800
Caption: something through association that&#39;s

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:22.879
Caption: also going to help imprint it into those

01:36:20.799 --> 01:36:24.718
Caption: neural pathways

01:36:22.879 --> 01:36:26.560
Caption: the other thing you could do is stay

01:36:24.719 --> 01:36:30.080
Caption: healthy surprisingly or not

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:32.159
Caption: unsurprisingly right sleep

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:34.959
Caption: eating safety

01:36:32.159 --> 01:36:37.439
Caption: discomfort stress these things really

01:36:34.959 --> 01:36:40.959
Caption: affect your memory retrieval and then

01:36:37.439 --> 01:36:43.359
Caption: the last one is to observe mindlessness

01:36:40.959 --> 01:36:45.839
Caption: right memories they can be malleable and

01:36:43.359 --> 01:36:47.600
Caption: so it&#39;s really important to to bring

01:36:45.839 --> 01:36:49.198
Caption: your observation skills to the table

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:51.760
Caption: maybe you want to take a different route

01:36:49.199 --> 01:36:53.920
Caption: to work or a different route home and

01:36:51.759 --> 01:36:56.718
Caption: just observe the things around you

01:36:53.919 --> 01:36:59.119
Caption: instead of normally maybe you drive and

01:36:56.719 --> 01:37:01.360
Caption: you arrive at your destination and you

01:36:59.119 --> 01:37:03.199
Caption: go hmm i didn&#39;t really

01:37:01.359 --> 01:37:05.198
Caption: i guess i was kind of on autopilot right

01:37:03.199 --> 01:37:07.679
Caption: you kind of dissociate from the

01:37:05.199 --> 01:37:10.080
Caption: experience and so maybe it&#39;s time to

01:37:07.679 --> 01:37:12.639
Caption: sharpen the edges of your foggy mind in

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:15.199
Caption: some of those places so take a look here

01:37:12.639 --> 01:37:16.959
Caption: this is the ways that we can improve our

01:37:15.199 --> 01:37:18.800
Caption: memory retrieval

01:37:16.959 --> 01:37:20.799
Caption: the methodology

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:23.759
Caption: managing your mindset intentional

01:37:20.799 --> 01:37:26.000
Caption: recalls staying healthy and observing

01:37:23.759 --> 01:37:27.678
Caption: mindlessness so

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.159
Caption: those are the ways you can improve

01:37:27.679 --> 01:37:30.159
Caption: retrieval

01:37:30.639 --> 01:37:33.040
Caption: as you go through the rest of the

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.000
Caption: conference

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:36.399
Caption: i want you to think about these

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.719
Caption: questions okay i want you to think about

01:37:36.399 --> 01:37:41.119
Caption: what you are remembering from the talks

01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:42.960
Caption: that you&#39;re seeing is there a pattern

01:37:41.119 --> 01:37:45.119
Caption: of the things that you notice

01:37:42.959 --> 01:37:49.359
Caption: are you sticking with certain topics are

01:37:45.119 --> 01:37:51.679
Caption: you sticking with certain speakers um

01:37:49.359 --> 01:37:54.000
Caption: why

01:37:51.679 --> 01:37:55.600
Caption: compare your notes and foci i want you

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.600
Caption: to talk to somebody else with

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:59.840
Caption: intentional recall ask them what were

01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:02.959
Caption: they focusing on what were you focusing

01:37:59.839 --> 01:38:05.678
Caption: on why and teach them oh this is what i

01:38:02.959 --> 01:38:08.080
Caption: learned out of this talk from this

01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:11.040
Caption: speaker what did you learn when we have

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:12.719
Caption: that it&#39;s going to help us remember the

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:15.040
Caption: content more

01:38:12.719 --> 01:38:17.360
Caption: what surface processing did you use the

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:18.879
Caption: shallow processing what deep processing

01:38:17.359 --> 01:38:21.600
Caption: maybe there were things that were more

01:38:18.879 --> 01:38:22.399
Caption: meaningful and had more purpose to you

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.959
Caption: right

01:38:22.399 --> 01:38:26.238
Caption: what distractions occurred

01:38:24.959 --> 01:38:29.119
Caption: you&#39;d be wise to turn off your

01:38:26.238 --> 01:38:31.279
Caption: notifications while you&#39;re in in speaker

01:38:29.119 --> 01:38:32.719
Caption: rooms and trying to pay attention so

01:38:31.279 --> 01:38:36.799
Caption: you&#39;re not having all these different

01:38:32.719 --> 01:38:36.800
Caption: distractions pop up right

01:38:36.959 --> 01:38:41.520
Caption: so memory can be a very tricky thing and

01:38:39.119 --> 01:38:44.080
Caption: if nothing else today i would like you

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:45.439
Caption: to remember this here&#39;s it&#39;s the big

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:47.679
Caption: secret that

01:38:45.439 --> 01:38:50.080
Caption: everybody&#39;s so worried about finding out

01:38:47.679 --> 01:38:51.920
Caption: and that&#39;s you know we all google the

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:54.000
Caption: things

01:38:51.919 --> 01:38:56.560
Caption: we all google the things right and we

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:00.799
Caption: all forget and as we&#39;ve learned today

01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:03.280
Caption: memories can be faulty they can create

01:39:00.799 --> 01:39:05.759
Caption: false memories we can

01:39:03.279 --> 01:39:08.158
Caption: get stuck and not be able to retrieve

01:39:05.759 --> 01:39:09.919
Caption: the the data that we already know and

01:39:08.159 --> 01:39:12.400
Caption: you don&#39;t have to memorize all the

01:39:09.919 --> 01:39:15.359
Caption: things having the ability to think think

01:39:12.399 --> 01:39:17.600
Caption: creatively through a solution that&#39;s

01:39:15.359 --> 01:39:20.000
Caption: where our strength lies and each of us

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:22.000
Caption: puts our own unique creative way of

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.639
Caption: approaching the solution to a client&#39;s

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:27.919
Caption: problem and you know it doesn&#39;t matter

01:39:24.639 --> 01:39:30.239
Caption: if we have to use the googles right to

01:39:27.919 --> 01:39:32.879
Caption: look up how to do things and

01:39:30.238 --> 01:39:35.919
Caption: having all of these coding tests and and

01:39:32.879 --> 01:39:38.000
Caption: only one memory subsystem to test you

01:39:35.919 --> 01:39:39.839
Caption: know i just really don&#39;t think that it&#39;s

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.520

01:53:31.679 --> 01:53:35.599
Caption: today i want to take you through first

01:53:33.359 --> 01:53:37.439
Caption: of all what is a feature tree

01:53:35.599 --> 01:53:39.599
Caption: why i use it in my workflow when i&#39;m

01:53:37.439 --> 01:53:41.599
Caption: designing and building products

01:53:39.599 --> 01:53:43.679
Caption: and why sort of a central artifact for

01:53:41.599 --> 01:53:45.360
Caption: teams to rally around and then also i&#39;m

01:53:43.679 --> 01:53:48.000
Caption: going to share some tips and tricks from

01:53:45.359 --> 01:53:50.158
Caption: how you create them and you&#39;ll also hear

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.599
Caption: today a few cornellisms i don&#39;t write

01:53:50.159 --> 01:53:53.520
Caption: scripts for my talks it&#39;s just

01:53:51.599 --> 01:53:55.360
Caption: incompatible with my nerves so i&#39;m just

01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:57.919
Caption: gonna wiggle it but within reason of

01:53:55.359 --> 01:54:00.718
Caption: course so let&#39;s jump right in

01:53:57.919 --> 01:54:03.359
Caption: for me the gold standard of a feature

01:54:00.719 --> 01:54:06.320
Caption: tree is that of up so up is a digital

01:54:03.359 --> 01:54:07.520
Caption: bank quick show of hands anyone with up

01:54:06.319 --> 01:54:09.678
Caption: yeah they&#39;re pretty cool i probably

01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:11.599
Caption: should change to them so let&#39;s imagine

01:54:09.679 --> 01:54:13.360
Caption: up that app in your pocket that is the

01:54:11.599 --> 01:54:15.919
Caption: product i&#39;m going to use a lot of sort

01:54:13.359 --> 01:54:17.439
Caption: of agile product service design kind of

01:54:15.919 --> 01:54:18.959
Caption: language here today so if you hear some

01:54:17.439 --> 01:54:20.879
Caption: of that language that&#39;s where that comes

01:54:18.959 --> 01:54:22.879
Caption: from but up that is the product the

01:54:20.879 --> 01:54:24.799
Caption: product is the tree the thing that your

01:54:22.879 --> 01:54:26.718
Caption: users see so that&#39;s the end goal

01:54:24.799 --> 01:54:29.520
Caption: visualizing the product

01:54:26.719 --> 01:54:31.280
Caption: next up we&#39;ve got a set of features

01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:33.359
Caption: that&#39;s the functionality everything

01:54:31.279 --> 01:54:36.319
Caption: that&#39;s built that the user can interact

01:54:33.359 --> 01:54:37.919
Caption: with what&#39;s built they sum to the tree

01:54:36.319 --> 01:54:40.079
Caption: so that&#39;s where the roots come from the

01:54:37.919 --> 01:54:42.000
Caption: tree pretty simple concept

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:43.760
Caption: and then we go into the detail of a

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.520
Caption: specific feature

01:54:43.759 --> 01:54:47.519
Caption: so here we&#39;ve got for example the

01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:49.279
Caption: feature of a payment and on the bottom

01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:51.119
Caption: right you&#39;ll see a key so you&#39;ve got

01:54:49.279 --> 01:54:53.279
Caption: stuff like what&#39;s being built or what&#39;s

01:54:51.119 --> 01:54:55.360
Caption: in progress what have we already done

01:54:53.279 --> 01:54:56.879
Caption: what&#39;s coming up or what have we pruned

01:54:55.359 --> 01:54:59.598
Caption: what are we not building sometimes it&#39;s

01:54:56.879 --> 01:55:02.718
Caption: nice to visualize that so for example in

01:54:59.599 --> 01:55:04.159
Caption: this very specific example we&#39;ve got

01:55:02.719 --> 01:55:05.520
Caption: making a payment of course it&#39;s a

01:55:04.159 --> 01:55:07.679
Caption: payment app you want to be able to make

01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:09.599
Caption: a payment what&#39;s next oh you might want

01:55:07.679 --> 01:55:11.119
Caption: to schedule the payment and then what&#39;s

01:55:09.599 --> 01:55:12.959
Caption: next you might want to do multiple of

01:55:11.119 --> 01:55:15.280
Caption: those and you want them to recur so

01:55:12.959 --> 01:55:17.359
Caption: that&#39;s just a way for users and whoever

01:55:15.279 --> 01:55:18.718
Caption: interacts with this feature tree to go

01:55:17.359 --> 01:55:20.238
Caption: that&#39;s a pretty simple way of me

01:55:18.719 --> 01:55:22.400
Caption: understanding what are all the things i

01:55:20.238 --> 01:55:24.238
Caption: can do in this product and you stagger

01:55:22.399 --> 01:55:26.399
Caption: those features and you&#39;ll see some of

01:55:24.238 --> 01:55:28.638
Caption: them connect they can get pretty curly

01:55:26.399 --> 01:55:31.198
Caption: pretty quickly but it&#39;s it&#39;s intended to

01:55:28.639 --> 01:55:33.679
Caption: be a simple communication artifact

01:55:31.199 --> 01:55:37.360
Caption: so if we zoom all the way out you&#39;ll see

01:55:33.679 --> 01:55:40.080
Caption: this long complicated map of features if

01:55:37.359 --> 01:55:41.040
Caption: you will so divided by columns sometimes

01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:43.599
Caption: even by

01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:45.679
Caption: priority or by rows the order in which

01:55:43.599 --> 01:55:48.639
Caption: it&#39;s been delivered but it may look like

01:55:45.679 --> 01:55:50.880
Caption: a really sophisticated complicated map

01:55:48.639 --> 01:55:52.800
Caption: and you might think this is a bank it&#39;s

01:55:50.879 --> 01:55:55.359
Caption: a public-facing product why are they

01:55:52.799 --> 01:55:56.718
Caption: making this sort of that transparent i

01:55:55.359 --> 01:55:58.718
Caption: think it&#39;s pretty cool for products to

01:55:56.719 --> 01:56:00.719
Caption: be so radically out there and say these

01:55:58.719 --> 01:56:02.400
Caption: are the things i&#39;ve done so it firstly

01:56:00.719 --> 01:56:03.840
Caption: allows people to navigate that map and

01:56:02.399 --> 01:56:06.399
Caption: see these are all the cool things i can

01:56:03.839 --> 01:56:08.238
Caption: do for example you want the api to hook

01:56:06.399 --> 01:56:10.158
Caption: in to get all your payment data you want

01:56:08.238 --> 01:56:12.079
Caption: to do some fancy graphs with it you can

01:56:10.159 --> 01:56:13.760
Caption: do that because it&#39;s lower down on the

01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:15.439
Caption: feature tree and you can see that that&#39;s

01:56:13.759 --> 01:56:18.079
Caption: only for some obsessive people not like

01:56:15.439 --> 01:56:19.439
Caption: me but it can also see what&#39;s up next

01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:20.239
Caption: for example

01:56:19.439 --> 01:56:22.319
Caption: so

01:56:20.238 --> 01:56:24.399
Caption: having that accountability publishing

01:56:22.319 --> 01:56:27.118
Caption: this online this is a fully interactive

01:56:24.399 --> 01:56:28.399
Caption: website super high fidelity i&#39;m not here

01:56:27.119 --> 01:56:29.840
Caption: today to tell you this is what we&#39;re

01:56:28.399 --> 01:56:32.238
Caption: aspiring to when we&#39;re doing feature

01:56:29.839 --> 01:56:33.118
Caption: trees but it exposes a concept to me at

01:56:32.238 --> 01:56:35.198
Caption: least

01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:37.119
Caption: pretty beautifully so if you&#39;re thinking

01:56:35.199 --> 01:56:40.000
Caption: this is super complicated it&#39;s very

01:56:37.119 --> 01:56:40.959
Caption: messy it&#39;s a lot of detail it&#39;s actually

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.040
Caption: in my

01:56:40.959 --> 01:56:46.319
Caption: estimation just supposed to be a really

01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:47.520
Caption: well organized list so i want to play a

01:56:46.319 --> 01:56:49.839
Caption: quick game

01:57:40.319 --> 01:57:44.718
Caption: keep your hands up if you organize your

01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:46.000
Caption: shopping list deliberately the keyword

01:57:44.719 --> 01:57:49.280
Caption: here is deliberately so that it can be

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.279
Caption: used in any grocery store

01:57:49.279 --> 01:57:53.279
Caption: telstra purple&#39;s hiring so come chat to

01:57:51.279 --> 01:57:54.879
Caption: us afterwards that&#39;ll be great no so the

01:57:53.279 --> 01:57:56.799
Caption: only concept i wanted to explore there

01:57:54.879 --> 01:57:59.279
Caption: is you might then be using your shopping

01:57:56.799 --> 01:58:00.799
Caption: list as a compass something that allows

01:57:59.279 --> 01:58:02.399
Caption: you to navigate or respond to the

01:58:00.799 --> 01:58:04.399
Caption: environment you&#39;re in so we&#39;re going to

01:58:02.399 --> 01:58:06.799
Caption: live a little bit in metaphor territory

01:58:04.399 --> 01:58:08.560
Caption: what is a feature tree is it a map is it

01:58:06.799 --> 01:58:09.439
Caption: a compass i&#39;m here to tell you why not

01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:11.839
Caption: both

01:58:09.439 --> 01:58:14.959
Caption: so typically when we see a feature tree

01:58:11.839 --> 01:58:17.279
Caption: a list a very simple well organized list

01:58:14.959 --> 01:58:19.520
Caption: i see one of those old school maps that

01:58:17.279 --> 01:58:21.678
Caption: you fold out it&#39;s a static fixed

01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:24.159
Caption: environment you think at least at that

01:58:21.679 --> 01:58:26.000
Caption: point in time you know your environment

01:58:24.159 --> 01:58:28.719
Caption: that is just your articulation i guess

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:30.639
Caption: of what we know now and what we&#39;ve built

01:58:28.719 --> 01:58:33.040
Caption: what we&#39;re currently building and what&#39;s

01:58:30.639 --> 01:58:35.199
Caption: up next sometimes even just arriving at

01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:36.479
Caption: that is sort of the destination that

01:58:35.199 --> 01:58:39.360
Caption: process

01:58:36.479 --> 01:58:41.279
Caption: but is it a compass how does a feature

01:58:39.359 --> 01:58:44.718
Caption: tree act as a compass to help us

01:58:41.279 --> 01:58:47.039
Caption: navigate the the colorful you know seas

01:58:44.719 --> 01:58:49.599
Caption: or world that is navigating this product

01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:52.319
Caption: space and that is if you&#39;ve got that

01:58:49.599 --> 01:58:54.239
Caption: baseline that document that set up that

01:58:52.319 --> 01:58:56.959
Caption: allows you to say right this is my

01:58:54.238 --> 01:58:59.359
Caption: product these are the features these are

01:58:56.959 --> 01:59:01.679
Caption: all the functionality that exists if for

01:58:59.359 --> 01:59:03.520
Caption: example introducing new functionality

01:59:01.679 --> 01:59:05.599
Caption: you&#39;ve got that visual artifact that

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:07.599
Caption: allows you to negotiate a little bit if

01:59:05.599 --> 01:59:10.159
Caption: i have this i won&#39;t be getting this or

01:59:07.599 --> 01:59:12.639
Caption: that fits in here or these things relate

01:59:10.159 --> 01:59:14.560
Caption: especially when there&#39;s multiple teams

01:59:12.639 --> 01:59:17.199
Caption: communicating around for example a

01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:19.520
Caption: product backlog and that you have that

01:59:17.199 --> 01:59:21.199
Caption: summary piece that accompanies it so it

01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:23.199
Caption: might sound a little bit like apologetic

01:59:21.199 --> 01:59:25.520
Caption: this is not like the most crazy outer

01:59:23.199 --> 01:59:27.760
Caption: topic ever but it&#39;s such a nice way of

01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:30.239
Caption: just surfacing coming up for air from a

01:59:27.759 --> 01:59:32.559
Caption: product backlog so i mentioned product

01:59:30.238 --> 01:59:34.959
Caption: backlog let&#39;s look at one so this is a

01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:36.239
Caption: common backlog what you don&#39;t have to do

01:59:34.959 --> 01:59:38.319
Caption: today is

01:59:36.238 --> 01:59:41.198
Caption: critique the user stories here you can i

01:59:38.319 --> 01:59:43.439
Caption: didn&#39;t write them so i&#39;ll join you so

01:59:41.199 --> 01:59:45.520
Caption: this is just an example of user stories

01:59:43.439 --> 01:59:47.119
Caption: in a backlog that developers would

01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:49.359
Caption: commonly use to build certain

01:59:47.119 --> 01:59:51.520
Caption: functionality on the right this is the

01:59:49.359 --> 01:59:53.759
Caption: product called jira i like the example

01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:55.679
Caption: here because it at least visually color

01:59:53.759 --> 01:59:58.158
Caption: codes all that green stories on the

01:59:55.679 --> 02:00:00.159
Caption: right i think they relate to one another

01:59:58.159 --> 02:00:02.239
Caption: and they form a feature set

02:00:00.159 --> 02:00:04.400
Caption: you can&#39;t scroll here but i can so for

02:00:02.238 --> 02:00:06.319
Caption: example when i scrolled down you can see

02:00:04.399 --> 02:00:07.359
Caption: okay there&#39;s multiple stories here so

02:00:06.319 --> 02:00:09.598
Caption: we&#39;re working on a piece of

02:00:07.359 --> 02:00:11.598
Caption: functionality for that feature here here

02:00:09.599 --> 02:00:13.760
Caption: so it does go into that space but

02:00:11.599 --> 02:00:16.239
Caption: sometimes it&#39;s not as visual

02:00:13.759 --> 02:00:17.919
Caption: so this is another deliberately sort of

02:00:16.238 --> 02:00:20.158
Caption: small

02:00:17.919 --> 02:00:21.520
Caption: screenshot here let&#39;s just for example

02:00:20.159 --> 02:00:24.000
Caption: say that first

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:25.439
Caption: one to seven stories here if you

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.159
Caption: understand this product it&#39;s all in the

02:00:25.439 --> 02:00:30.560
Caption: realm of like i get it it&#39;s maybe a

02:00:28.159 --> 02:00:32.719
Caption: value on a page and when was it last

02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:34.080
Caption: updated things like that so this back to

02:00:32.719 --> 02:00:36.080
Caption: the shopping

02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:38.560
Caption: experience is for example i&#39;m in the

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:40.800
Caption: wolves in palmyra i&#39;m there i just grab

02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:42.719
Caption: a basket i know i need bread and eggs i

02:00:40.799 --> 02:00:44.718
Caption: think i know what needs to happen story

02:00:42.719 --> 02:00:47.119
Caption: one to seven all of a sudden shout out

02:00:44.719 --> 02:00:49.119
Caption: to my partner jeff she calls me i&#39;ve got

02:00:47.119 --> 02:00:51.520
Caption: a basket by the way can you buy eight

02:00:49.119 --> 02:00:52.320
Caption: watermelons for me and i&#39;m like i don&#39;t

02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:54.319
Caption: have

02:00:52.319 --> 02:00:57.040
Caption: hashtag scoped for eight watermelons in

02:00:54.319 --> 02:00:59.279
Caption: my basket it&#39;s gonna smash the bread

02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:01.280
Caption: i&#39;m wearing a mask i&#39;m gonna sneeze

02:00:59.279 --> 02:01:03.118
Caption: straight up a bad time no one likes that

02:01:01.279 --> 02:01:06.718
Caption: kind of a surprise

02:01:03.119 --> 02:01:08.959
Caption: if we had a feature tree you could say

02:01:06.719 --> 02:01:11.280
Caption: for example that is a really high effort

02:01:08.959 --> 02:01:13.439
Caption: or high value feature visualized that

02:01:11.279 --> 02:01:15.598
Caption: way you&#39;re gonna run through a quick you

02:01:13.439 --> 02:01:17.759
Caption: know quick fire of stories over here but

02:01:15.599 --> 02:01:19.280
Caption: there is that big thing coming our way

02:01:17.759 --> 02:01:21.439
Caption: that story in this example was just

02:01:19.279 --> 02:01:24.238
Caption: casually create an ios version of the

02:01:21.439 --> 02:01:27.198
Caption: app and we were like okay cool cool cool

02:01:24.238 --> 02:01:29.359
Caption: um so here&#39;s another example i say does

02:01:27.199 --> 02:01:32.479
Caption: it hurt yet i&#39;m humoring designers

02:01:29.359 --> 02:01:34.158
Caption: sometimes we&#39;re asked to just hand over

02:01:32.479 --> 02:01:36.080
Caption: a um

02:01:34.159 --> 02:01:37.360
Caption: all of the research we&#39;ve done so just

02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:39.280
Caption: quickly give me all the business

02:01:37.359 --> 02:01:41.919
Caption: requirements and we&#39;ll build it

02:01:39.279 --> 02:01:44.559
Caption: detail has a home i absolutely love

02:01:41.919 --> 02:01:46.319
Caption: detail but this is not that

02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:48.800
Caption: if you pull me into a meeting with no

02:01:46.319 --> 02:01:50.959
Caption: notice what have you done where are we

02:01:48.799 --> 02:01:53.198
Caption: at what are we building this does not

02:01:50.959 --> 02:01:54.479
Caption: give you that so all i&#39;m saying is this

02:01:53.199 --> 02:01:56.560
Caption: has a place

02:01:54.479 --> 02:01:57.599
Caption: especially when it comes to the

02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:00.319
Caption: tactical

02:01:57.599 --> 02:02:02.719
Caption: strategic or vision or system level

02:02:00.319 --> 02:02:04.799
Caption: transformation that detail for me lives

02:02:02.719 --> 02:02:07.199
Caption: all the way in the tactical don&#39;t you

02:02:04.799 --> 02:02:08.879
Caption: dare just over discover things that are

02:02:07.199 --> 02:02:11.199
Caption: three four five years away because it&#39;s

02:02:08.879 --> 02:02:15.118
Caption: gonna go stale so what a feature tree

02:02:11.199 --> 02:02:17.520
Caption: does really well for me is um support

02:02:15.119 --> 02:02:18.560
Caption: this the detail that we&#39;ve discovered

02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:20.639
Caption: and then

02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:23.760
Caption: it visualizes that neatly where it fits

02:02:20.639 --> 02:02:26.159
Caption: in and it supports the delivery of the

02:02:23.759 --> 02:02:28.559
Caption: backlog so it represents the work it&#39;s

02:02:26.159 --> 02:02:30.000
Caption: the sum of what&#39;s in the backlog in a

02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:32.959
Caption: more visual way

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.639
Caption: so that&#39;s kind of the theory bit over i

02:02:32.959 --> 02:02:36.799
Caption: guess so introducing you to what it is

02:02:34.639 --> 02:02:38.800
Caption: let&#39;s go into why i think it&#39;s awesome

02:02:36.799 --> 02:02:40.718
Caption: it&#39;s good for me to give get a lay of

02:02:38.799 --> 02:02:43.520
Caption: the land like who is here in the room so

02:02:40.719 --> 02:02:46.000
Caption: i might ask you or online if my mom in

02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:47.279
Caption: south africa is watching hello melinda

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.759
Caption: um so

02:02:47.279 --> 02:02:51.678
Caption: we&#39;ve got four groups here crudely

02:02:49.759 --> 02:02:53.118
Caption: summarized right crudely summarized if

02:02:51.679 --> 02:02:55.040
Caption: you&#39;re not in one of these groups pick

02:02:53.119 --> 02:02:58.399
Caption: one but i just want a quick show of

02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:00.799
Caption: hands so designers

02:02:58.399 --> 02:03:03.119
Caption: my fan club over there thank you awesome

02:03:00.799 --> 02:03:04.959
Caption: okay so developers

02:03:03.119 --> 02:03:07.599
Caption: that could be data divs really well

02:03:04.959 --> 02:03:09.520
Caption: represented awesome um product owners or

02:03:07.599 --> 02:03:11.840
Caption: product people anyone in that space

02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:14.319
Caption: awesome and then project stakeholders

02:03:11.839 --> 02:03:16.638
Caption: whatever that means awesome colorful

02:03:14.319 --> 02:03:18.799
Caption: okay so i&#39;ll try and skew towards the

02:03:16.639 --> 02:03:20.959
Caption: dev side of things if my

02:03:18.799 --> 02:03:22.559
Caption: you know abilities allow so i want to

02:03:20.959 --> 02:03:24.399
Caption: take you through my experience of

02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:26.719
Caption: exposing or introducing this as an

02:03:24.399 --> 02:03:28.399
Caption: artifact to these four groups

02:03:26.719 --> 02:03:30.400
Caption: what changes i brought about or what

02:03:28.399 --> 02:03:31.759
Caption: kinds of problems does it solve i&#39;ll

02:03:30.399 --> 02:03:32.959
Caption: also on the right of each of these

02:03:31.759 --> 02:03:34.879
Caption: slides just show you some of the

02:03:32.959 --> 02:03:36.718
Caption: examples that i&#39;ve worked on

02:03:34.879 --> 02:03:38.879
Caption: i may have had a direct hand in some of

02:03:36.719 --> 02:03:40.320
Caption: them or my team the fan club over there

02:03:38.879 --> 02:03:42.399
Caption: may have created some of it so if you&#39;ve

02:03:40.319 --> 02:03:44.718
Caption: got any questions yeah if you love them

02:03:42.399 --> 02:03:47.040
Caption: let me know if you don&#39;t

02:03:44.719 --> 02:03:48.639
Caption: so let&#39;s jump into why designers love it

02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:50.080
Caption: you can all read the bullets as well so

02:03:48.639 --> 02:03:52.479
Caption: i&#39;ll do some storytelling around the

02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:55.040
Caption: bullets but the first thing we do is

02:03:52.479 --> 02:03:57.359
Caption: often when we are introduced i work in a

02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:59.280
Caption: consulting capacity so

02:03:57.359 --> 02:04:00.959
Caption: when we&#39;re introduced to a new problem

02:03:59.279 --> 02:04:02.718
Caption: you might go through some rapid research

02:04:00.959 --> 02:04:04.639
Caption: on my favorite is the research has been

02:04:02.719 --> 02:04:06.400
Caption: done can you just make it look pretty so

02:04:04.639 --> 02:04:08.000
Caption: we might end up for example with a

02:04:06.399 --> 02:04:10.479
Caption: pretty prototype it&#39;s clickable it&#39;s

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.439
Caption: real it feels good the designer smashed

02:04:10.479 --> 02:04:13.520
Caption: it

02:04:11.439 --> 02:04:15.439
Caption: but there&#39;s so much more value about

02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:17.679
Caption: going through that process sincerely and

02:04:15.439 --> 02:04:19.839
Caption: in depth you gain a lot of context so

02:04:17.679 --> 02:04:22.239
Caption: the first bullet there is it allows us

02:04:19.839 --> 02:04:24.560
Caption: to share the context far beyond just the

02:04:22.238 --> 02:04:26.238
Caption: pretty pictures because the second we

02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:28.239
Caption: asked some of the questions

02:04:26.238 --> 02:04:30.000
Caption: is that system ready to give us the data

02:04:28.238 --> 02:04:32.319
Caption: we think we need for that feature day

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:35.040
Caption: one no it&#39;s not okay is it still a

02:04:32.319 --> 02:04:37.118
Caption: valuable problem to solve yes okay well

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:39.359
Caption: we might untangle the prototype ever so

02:04:37.119 --> 02:04:41.119
Caption: slightly and that might be represented

02:04:39.359 --> 02:04:43.198
Caption: by the order in which we organize our

02:04:41.119 --> 02:04:44.880
Caption: thought so again pretty simple concept

02:04:43.199 --> 02:04:45.599
Caption: but it is nice for us to at least then

02:04:44.879 --> 02:04:47.118
Caption: go

02:04:45.599 --> 02:04:49.439
Caption: if i just want to do the right thing for

02:04:47.119 --> 02:04:50.800
Caption: the users and for the products owners

02:04:49.439 --> 02:04:52.560
Caption: and stakeholders that kind of thing you

02:04:50.799 --> 02:04:53.839
Caption: want to be able to at least organize

02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:56.000
Caption: your thought in a way where you can

02:04:53.839 --> 02:04:57.839
Caption: systematically feel like the goalposts

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.238
Caption: are not moving you&#39;re at least just

02:04:57.839 --> 02:05:02.080
Caption: slowly summing to that experience

02:05:00.238 --> 02:05:04.319
Caption: perfect example of when things change

02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:07.679
Caption: you can adjust it allows you to find

02:05:04.319 --> 02:05:09.439
Caption: discovery gaps so my favorite is go tada

02:05:07.679 --> 02:05:10.800
Caption: i&#39;m done and then a developer would be

02:05:09.439 --> 02:05:11.520
Caption: like well

02:05:10.799 --> 02:05:13.118
Caption: i

02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:14.959
Caption: get you&#39;re close but not so have you

02:05:13.119 --> 02:05:17.040
Caption: thought about that that way does this go

02:05:14.959 --> 02:05:18.479
Caption: where does back go and all that stuff so

02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:21.199
Caption: that&#39;s a really good example for me

02:05:18.479 --> 02:05:23.359
Caption: where i could then go back and say

02:05:21.199 --> 02:05:25.360
Caption: cool let me add that to my future tree

02:05:23.359 --> 02:05:29.040
Caption: or story on that feature tree if you

02:05:25.359 --> 02:05:31.359
Caption: will and go i&#39;ll go back and i&#39;ll go

02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:32.799
Caption: do some discovery and lastly like i&#39;ve

02:05:31.359 --> 02:05:34.718
Caption: probably already mentioned it gives us a

02:05:32.799 --> 02:05:36.399
Caption: bit of a seat at the strategy chats i&#39;m

02:05:34.719 --> 02:05:38.480
Caption: being lazy with the wording strategy

02:05:36.399 --> 02:05:40.560
Caption: chats but when you&#39;ve discovered stuff

02:05:38.479 --> 02:05:42.238
Caption: you understand user problems

02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:44.560
Caption: you might think that the road map that

02:05:42.238 --> 02:05:46.959
Caption: was agreed to six months ago is still up

02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:48.239
Caption: to date it&#39;s probably not it allows us

02:05:46.959 --> 02:05:50.000
Caption: to give some input in that

02:05:48.238 --> 02:05:52.238
Caption: reprioritization of work because we&#39;ve

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:54.399
Caption: done some of that discovery

02:05:52.238 --> 02:05:55.678
Caption: so from a development perspective should

02:05:54.399 --> 02:05:57.439
Caption: be no surprise to you i&#39;m not a

02:05:55.679 --> 02:05:59.199
Caption: developer so i&#39;ll try but this is what

02:05:57.439 --> 02:06:01.599
Caption: my colleagues at telstra purple have

02:05:59.199 --> 02:06:02.639
Caption: mentioned it&#39;s helpful for so especially

02:06:01.599 --> 02:06:04.399
Caption: when you&#39;re

02:06:02.639 --> 02:06:05.760
Caption: let&#39;s say for example it&#39;s a really long

02:06:04.399 --> 02:06:08.080
Caption: development gig it&#39;s a really

02:06:05.759 --> 02:06:10.559
Caption: established product onboarding a new

02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:12.320
Caption: team member it&#39;s awesome so the example

02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:14.080
Caption: here on the right would be lots of

02:06:12.319 --> 02:06:15.598
Caption: different features of a product i&#39;m sure

02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:17.919
Caption: you can put together who it&#39;s for and

02:06:15.599 --> 02:06:20.080
Caption: what it is so let&#39;s assume some of those

02:06:17.919 --> 02:06:22.238
Caption: features they could for example say you

02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:23.760
Caption: see that feature you know the second one

02:06:22.238 --> 02:06:26.319
Caption: from the left i&#39;ve worked on that

02:06:23.759 --> 02:06:28.238
Caption: feature all of these green dots i built

02:06:26.319 --> 02:06:30.078
Caption: that with my own bare hands and my blood

02:06:28.238 --> 02:06:31.439
Caption: sweat and tears and this is what i&#39;ve

02:06:30.079 --> 02:06:32.800
Caption: learned when i did that oh you&#39;re going

02:06:31.439 --> 02:06:35.198
Caption: to join me working on that feature

02:06:32.799 --> 02:06:37.359
Caption: fantastic ignore the rest for now but if

02:06:35.199 --> 02:06:39.599
Caption: you ever encounter something go look for

02:06:37.359 --> 02:06:41.359
Caption: it find it in it at least at the very

02:06:39.599 --> 02:06:43.439
Caption: least it allows you to navigate a bit of

02:06:41.359 --> 02:06:45.598
Caption: that uncertainty because i don&#39;t think a

02:06:43.439 --> 02:06:47.198
Caption: product backlog if you want to run some

02:06:45.599 --> 02:06:49.199
Caption: fancy report of all the stories that

02:06:47.199 --> 02:06:50.880
Caption: were done where are the high story

02:06:49.199 --> 02:06:52.719
Caption: pointers which are the ones that dragged

02:06:50.879 --> 02:06:54.718
Caption: on six prints longer than it should have

02:06:52.719 --> 02:06:56.480
Caption: that kind of drawbar in a backlog maybe

02:06:54.719 --> 02:06:57.280
Caption: it doesn&#39;t give that story but at least

02:06:56.479 --> 02:06:59.119
Caption: this

02:06:57.279 --> 02:07:00.959
Caption: helps you to come up for air and tell

02:06:59.119 --> 02:07:03.280
Caption: that story a little bit

02:07:00.959 --> 02:07:04.718
Caption: so it visualizes the holistic scope and

02:07:03.279 --> 02:07:06.559
Caption: progress

02:07:04.719 --> 02:07:08.960
Caption: so we&#39;ll get into how we even get to

02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:11.119
Caption: this point but again often taking a

02:07:08.959 --> 02:07:13.359
Caption: backlog and trying organizing it in a

02:07:11.119 --> 02:07:14.399
Caption: way that does conveniently over

02:07:13.359 --> 02:07:15.919
Caption: summarize always use that word

02:07:14.399 --> 02:07:17.359
Caption: conveniently because someone is just

02:07:15.919 --> 02:07:20.158
Caption: just tell me what i need to know i&#39;m

02:07:17.359 --> 02:07:22.479
Caption: like there&#39;s so much detail so if the

02:07:20.159 --> 02:07:24.400
Caption: point of getting here if your backlog is

02:07:22.479 --> 02:07:26.718
Caption: in a bit of a state because sometimes it

02:07:24.399 --> 02:07:28.238
Caption: is and again teams like things the way

02:07:26.719 --> 02:07:30.000
Caption: that they like them so if you&#39;re

02:07:28.238 --> 02:07:31.839
Caption: changing teams onboarded a new team

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.359
Caption: member and you want to sort of reflect

02:07:31.839 --> 02:07:34.959
Caption: to how that team likes to work and

02:07:33.359 --> 02:07:37.198
Caption: organize themselves

02:07:34.959 --> 02:07:39.520
Caption: then if the backlog is a mess your

02:07:37.199 --> 02:07:41.360
Caption: feature tree will be a mess but yeah

02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:43.760
Caption: call me toxically positive but that&#39;s an

02:07:41.359 --> 02:07:46.079
Caption: opportunity for a feature tree so you

02:07:43.759 --> 02:07:47.839
Caption: can reorganize that work then so that

02:07:46.079 --> 02:07:50.239
Caption: for the most bit

02:07:47.839 --> 02:07:52.319
Caption: for the almost everyone working on this

02:07:50.238 --> 02:07:54.718
Caption: product on the example of up if you want

02:07:52.319 --> 02:07:56.319
Caption: to so so radically put yourself out

02:07:54.719 --> 02:07:58.560
Caption: there and make it that ultimate

02:07:56.319 --> 02:08:00.799
Caption: accountability of here&#39;s what i&#39;m doing

02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:02.800
Caption: it visualizes that and it just allows

02:08:00.799 --> 02:08:03.839
Caption: you to say this is what i&#39;ve done this

02:08:02.799 --> 02:08:05.198
Caption: is what i&#39;m doing and that&#39;s what&#39;s

02:08:03.839 --> 02:08:07.359
Caption: coming up next

02:08:05.199 --> 02:08:09.040
Caption: the last bullet here empowers autonomy

02:08:07.359 --> 02:08:10.718
Caption: is a bit like what a designer feels like

02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:12.479
Caption: but i&#39;ve got input to give into the

02:08:10.719 --> 02:08:14.400
Caption: order because users want this more than

02:08:12.479 --> 02:08:17.679
Caption: what you think they wanted there or

02:08:14.399 --> 02:08:19.359
Caption: months ago similar story here in that

02:08:17.679 --> 02:08:21.520
Caption: if we&#39;ve got a specific feature

02:08:19.359 --> 02:08:23.678
Caption: especially things that are two or three

02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:25.839
Caption: or four sprints ahead and we say this is

02:08:23.679 --> 02:08:28.639
Caption: a bit of functionality that we want to

02:08:25.839 --> 02:08:30.959
Caption: develop but a produ a product owner had

02:08:28.639 --> 02:08:32.719
Caption: a brilliant idea overnight or promised

02:08:30.959 --> 02:08:34.959
Caption: some functionality at a pub last night

02:08:32.719 --> 02:08:37.440
Caption: whatever story it rings through then you

02:08:34.959 --> 02:08:39.439
Caption: want to introduce new functionality

02:08:37.439 --> 02:08:41.919
Caption: then or immediately a developer would

02:08:39.439 --> 02:08:43.599
Caption: say for example with a feature tree

02:08:41.919 --> 02:08:45.279
Caption: okay you see all of this functionality

02:08:43.599 --> 02:08:47.520
Caption: we&#39;ve got over here i don&#39;t think we&#39;ve

02:08:45.279 --> 02:08:49.439
Caption: got time or the technical resources for

02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:52.000
Caption: example to get any of that if we

02:08:49.439 --> 02:08:54.560
Caption: introduce that and it just facilitates

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.560
Caption: that needful conversation about always

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:58.719
Caption: you know keeping the what&#39;s next in

02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:01.839
Caption: focus so that you can you can focus on

02:08:58.719 --> 02:09:03.760
Caption: that while having a plan for what&#39;s to

02:09:01.839 --> 02:09:05.759
Caption: come so that&#39;s why i like them in that

02:09:03.759 --> 02:09:08.158
Caption: context as well

02:09:05.759 --> 02:09:10.000
Caption: so let&#39;s keep the head there

02:09:08.159 --> 02:09:11.520
Caption: why product owners love it they&#39;re not

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.439
Caption: not just product owners it&#39;s people

02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:15.599
Caption: working on products in that product

02:09:13.439 --> 02:09:16.639
Caption: sense in its broadest possible colorful

02:09:15.599 --> 02:09:19.040
Caption: meaning

02:09:16.639 --> 02:09:20.000
Caption: if it&#39;s multiple trees is it a feature

02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:22.719
Caption: forest

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.879
Caption: who knows so this could be multiple

02:09:22.719 --> 02:09:27.040
Caption: feature trees and what we do here for

02:09:24.879 --> 02:09:29.359
Caption: example again not my project but it was

02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:32.159
Caption: used to affect here more in the map

02:09:29.359 --> 02:09:33.040
Caption: context let&#39;s just visualize what we&#39;re

02:09:32.159 --> 02:09:36.000
Caption: doing

02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:37.839
Caption: a big big stream of work with multiple

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.159
Caption: teams working on multiple things so it

02:09:37.839 --> 02:09:42.638
Caption: can get complex quite quickly but what

02:09:40.159 --> 02:09:44.239
Caption: we&#39;re trying to do is get a lay of

02:09:42.639 --> 02:09:45.760
Caption: visualize it this is an online

02:09:44.238 --> 02:09:48.559
Caption: whiteboarding tool doesn&#39;t always have

02:09:45.759 --> 02:09:49.839
Caption: to be presentation ready if you will but

02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:52.239
Caption: it doesn&#39;t even it can even be a

02:09:49.839 --> 02:09:53.520
Caption: scribble but just have a visualization

02:09:52.238 --> 02:09:55.039
Caption: of everything we&#39;re working on and

02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:57.359
Caption: that&#39;s where the color coding here comes

02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:59.199
Caption: in we&#39;ve built all of this stuff

02:09:57.359 --> 02:10:00.799
Caption: this is getting for example data from a

02:09:59.199 --> 02:10:03.040
Caption: platform that we&#39;re retiring in six

02:10:00.799 --> 02:10:04.879
Caption: months we&#39;re going to have holes here

02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:06.560
Caption: and this is what&#39;s coming up and what

02:10:04.879 --> 02:10:08.638
Caption: that also allows people to do for

02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:10.800
Caption: example is budget cycles

02:10:08.639 --> 02:10:12.639
Caption: love them or hate them but they exist so

02:10:10.799 --> 02:10:14.799
Caption: how much cashola do you need for the

02:10:12.639 --> 02:10:17.360
Caption: next 12 months okay cool let&#39;s do a very

02:10:14.799 --> 02:10:18.638
Caption: cursory estimate i think we&#39;ll focus on

02:10:17.359 --> 02:10:20.399
Caption: this section

02:10:18.639 --> 02:10:22.880
Caption: let&#39;s see if we&#39;ve got the right people

02:10:20.399 --> 02:10:24.638
Caption: the right skill sets the right time

02:10:22.879 --> 02:10:26.799
Caption: allotted and things like that and then

02:10:24.639 --> 02:10:29.439
Caption: you can do an estimate on something like

02:10:26.799 --> 02:10:31.678
Caption: this so if you&#39;re a product owner

02:10:29.439 --> 02:10:33.919
Caption: working on multiple products think of a

02:10:31.679 --> 02:10:36.079
Caption: way that at least we can dive into the

02:10:33.919 --> 02:10:37.759
Caption: detail from here or come up for air and

02:10:36.079 --> 02:10:39.919
Caption: at least depending on which direction in

02:10:37.759 --> 02:10:42.559
Caption: your organization you kind of tell the

02:10:39.919 --> 02:10:44.479
Caption: story of your product and then why

02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:46.319
Caption: project people are again i refuse the

02:10:44.479 --> 02:10:47.759
Caption: word stakeholders it sounds so clunky

02:10:46.319 --> 02:10:50.078
Caption: but then here&#39;s me again cross

02:10:47.759 --> 02:10:52.879
Caption: capabilities streams of work anyway so

02:10:50.079 --> 02:10:54.399
Caption: cross capability streams of work um if

02:10:52.879 --> 02:10:55.839
Caption: you&#39;ve got multiple teams again with

02:10:54.399 --> 02:10:58.158
Caption: multiple skill sets there might be a

02:10:55.839 --> 02:10:59.839
Caption: team for example here in perth say if

02:10:58.159 --> 02:11:01.599
Caption: we&#39;ve got a team over east and they&#39;re

02:10:59.839 --> 02:11:03.118
Caption: working on a piece of functionality

02:11:01.599 --> 02:11:04.959
Caption: maybe their own team wants their own

02:11:03.119 --> 02:11:06.479
Caption: backlog you might actually separate

02:11:04.959 --> 02:11:08.718
Caption: different backlogs for things like this

02:11:06.479 --> 02:11:10.799
Caption: but you&#39;re at least able to organize

02:11:08.719 --> 02:11:12.880
Caption: work in the way that you want and then

02:11:10.799 --> 02:11:14.638
Caption: visualize it accordingly so

02:11:12.879 --> 02:11:16.879
Caption: very easily we could say that column on

02:11:14.639 --> 02:11:18.880
Caption: the far right that&#39;s actually

02:11:16.879 --> 02:11:20.560
Caption: you know the team in sydney that one is

02:11:18.879 --> 02:11:21.919
Caption: a team in melbourne this is the birth

02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:23.359
Caption: team for example you could do things

02:11:21.919 --> 02:11:25.198
Caption: like that as well

02:11:23.359 --> 02:11:27.359
Caption: i&#39;ve mentioned the color coding a few

02:11:25.199 --> 02:11:29.280
Caption: times now it&#39;s just a simple artifact

02:11:27.359 --> 02:11:30.718
Caption: think of it as like a traffic sort of

02:11:29.279 --> 02:11:33.359
Caption: light system

02:11:30.719 --> 02:11:35.199
Caption: it sets expectations in a way as well in

02:11:33.359 --> 02:11:37.040
Caption: public facing products so for example

02:11:35.199 --> 02:11:38.719
Caption: there&#39;s a new piece of functionality we

02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:40.799
Caption: want to get the marketing team involved

02:11:38.719 --> 02:11:42.639
Caption: to celebrate the the launch of something

02:11:40.799 --> 02:11:44.638
Caption: for example they need to know when they

02:11:42.639 --> 02:11:47.199
Caption: need to get ready that kind of thing so

02:11:44.639 --> 02:11:50.079
Caption: you could for example have ready to

02:11:47.199 --> 02:11:51.679
Caption: launch and then that team could say okay

02:11:50.079 --> 02:11:53.439
Caption: they&#39;ll change the color once their

02:11:51.679 --> 02:11:55.119
Caption: things are in order but this is very

02:11:53.439 --> 02:11:58.000
Caption: much focused on the development of the

02:11:55.119 --> 02:11:59.679
Caption: product and what&#39;s live for a user today

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.520
Caption: and then a small underrated feature as

02:11:59.679 --> 02:12:02.959
Caption: well you&#39;ll probably discover some other

02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:05.199
Caption: ones as well but it can

02:12:02.959 --> 02:12:07.520
Caption: link directly to a product backlog as

02:12:05.199 --> 02:12:09.840
Caption: well i don&#39;t know how many organizations

02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:11.359
Caption: allow the people to come in and leave

02:12:09.839 --> 02:12:13.279
Caption: notes on user stories and stuff like

02:12:11.359 --> 02:12:15.118
Caption: that depending on your culture depending

02:12:13.279 --> 02:12:16.638
Caption: on where you are but people can always

02:12:15.119 --> 02:12:19.199
Caption: ask questions especially if they&#39;ve got

02:12:16.639 --> 02:12:21.199
Caption: helpful input so that one little random

02:12:19.199 --> 02:12:23.440
Caption: dot over there that looks interesting

02:12:21.199 --> 02:12:25.199
Caption: what&#39;s that about you can just sort of

02:12:23.439 --> 02:12:27.439
Caption: put brackets at the end put the user

02:12:25.199 --> 02:12:29.280
Caption: story id they usually have numbers

02:12:27.439 --> 02:12:30.238
Caption: hyperlink that you click on that it

02:12:29.279 --> 02:12:31.839
Caption: opens

02:12:30.238 --> 02:12:35.039
Caption: if you&#39;ve not been blocked from the

02:12:31.839 --> 02:12:36.879
Caption: project so it should open so

02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:37.839
Caption: that&#39;s sort of how these different user

02:12:36.879 --> 02:12:39.678
Caption: groups

02:12:37.839 --> 02:12:41.759
Caption: have benefit from there you&#39;ll also see

02:12:39.679 --> 02:12:43.679
Caption: one column there again not my specific

02:12:41.759 --> 02:12:46.158
Caption: project or feature tree but in this

02:12:43.679 --> 02:12:48.400
Caption: instance arriving at this complicated

02:12:46.159 --> 02:12:52.159
Caption: feature tree was a great way of just

02:12:48.399 --> 02:12:53.919
Caption: visualizing the sheer volume of work we

02:12:52.159 --> 02:12:55.920
Caption: think we&#39;ve committed to but the

02:12:53.919 --> 02:12:58.079
Caption: spoilers none of this can always happen

02:12:55.919 --> 02:12:59.839
Caption: before say august that year so there was

02:12:58.079 --> 02:13:02.159
Caption: a column an entire feature where they

02:12:59.839 --> 02:13:04.959
Caption: said if we want something that is

02:13:02.159 --> 02:13:07.760
Caption: polished end-to-end vertically slices

02:13:04.959 --> 02:13:09.679
Caption: got the full real piece of functionality

02:13:07.759 --> 02:13:11.039
Caption: let&#39;s de-prioritize some functionality

02:13:09.679 --> 02:13:12.800
Caption: on the right so that was my

02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:16.159
Caption: understanding how this was of impact for

02:13:12.799 --> 02:13:18.078
Caption: that specific product

02:13:16.159 --> 02:13:20.479
Caption: when do we plant feature trees i love

02:13:18.079 --> 02:13:22.479
Caption: these metaphors so you can either in a

02:13:20.479 --> 02:13:24.560
Caption: consulting context often there&#39;s a need

02:13:22.479 --> 02:13:26.399
Caption: for one so we we work with an existing

02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:28.319
Caption: product again even the process of

02:13:26.399 --> 02:13:30.638
Caption: onboarding an entirely new team to a

02:13:28.319 --> 02:13:33.040
Caption: product they may want just to use it as

02:13:30.639 --> 02:13:35.280
Caption: part of their intuition building phase

02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:36.799
Caption: you know any two three four sprints

02:13:35.279 --> 02:13:38.959
Caption: that&#39;s time you will need to build

02:13:36.799 --> 02:13:40.479
Caption: intuition about a product spoilers make

02:13:38.959 --> 02:13:42.639
Caption: a feature tree because you could

02:13:40.479 --> 02:13:44.079
Caption: organize your own thought you can replay

02:13:42.639 --> 02:13:46.159
Caption: your understanding to someone that&#39;s

02:13:44.079 --> 02:13:47.439
Caption: been on the project for a long while

02:13:46.159 --> 02:13:48.880
Caption: it&#39;s going to have to iterate a few

02:13:47.439 --> 02:13:50.879
Caption: times but there&#39;s that magic point of

02:13:48.879 --> 02:13:52.319
Caption: like oh okay we see it the same way and

02:13:50.879 --> 02:13:54.319
Caption: that&#39;s really a good point where people

02:13:52.319 --> 02:13:56.638
Caption: can start becoming autonomous in their

02:13:54.319 --> 02:13:58.718
Caption: decisions and things like that

02:13:56.639 --> 02:14:00.239
Caption: but spoilers is usually this at least

02:13:58.719 --> 02:14:02.639
Caption: from some of our experiences that&#39;s why

02:14:00.238 --> 02:14:04.879
Caption: i use the fire extinguisher on the right

02:14:02.639 --> 02:14:06.639
Caption: i use the knife for me when you&#39;ve done

02:14:04.879 --> 02:14:08.319
Caption: a polished i mentioned before we&#39;ve done

02:14:06.639 --> 02:14:10.639
Caption: this polished prototype it looks

02:14:08.319 --> 02:14:12.238
Caption: beautiful it&#39;s awesome now we need to

02:14:10.639 --> 02:14:14.560
Caption: answer those difficult questions of how

02:14:12.238 --> 02:14:16.799
Caption: do we make it real how do we cut pieces

02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:19.119
Caption: of functionality and that&#39;s why i like

02:14:16.799 --> 02:14:22.559
Caption: the knife so we call it story slicing so

02:14:19.119 --> 02:14:22.560
Caption: let&#39;s go into the first example

02:14:22.719 --> 02:14:26.000
Caption: of how you grow one when you&#39;re working

02:14:24.159 --> 02:14:27.599
Caption: with an existing backlog so you&#39;ve got

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Caption: your backlog hopefully it might be a

02:14:27.599 --> 02:14:32.719
Caption: tool like jira or azure devops you might

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.040
Caption: use like a kanban style thing like

02:14:32.719 --> 02:14:37.599
Caption: trello for example if you&#39;re using this

02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:39.439
Caption: in a non-product space just to organize

02:14:37.599 --> 02:14:42.239
Caption: your shopping lists for example some of

02:14:39.439 --> 02:14:44.079
Caption: you so um if you you take your list

02:14:42.238 --> 02:14:45.439
Caption: whatever list you have it&#39;s probably in

02:14:44.079 --> 02:14:48.239
Caption: a tool somewhere

02:14:45.439 --> 02:14:50.319
Caption: command or control i export csv get it

02:14:48.238 --> 02:14:52.559
Caption: in a workable format so now at least

02:14:50.319 --> 02:14:55.279
Caption: you&#39;re not distracted by what it is you

02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:56.879
Caption: just have a clean list of what it is

02:14:55.279 --> 02:14:59.118
Caption: now you can probably make a decision do

02:14:56.879 --> 02:15:01.040
Caption: you work in a physical copy or a digital

02:14:59.119 --> 02:15:02.239
Caption: copy so there&#39;s lots of awesome digital

02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:04.159
Caption: tools

02:15:02.238 --> 02:15:06.238
Caption: if your team if you sense we&#39;re not

02:15:04.159 --> 02:15:08.320
Caption: aligned we can&#39;t talk about the backlog

02:15:06.238 --> 02:15:10.158
Caption: in the same ways and you cringe when

02:15:08.319 --> 02:15:12.718
Caption: people think they mention the priorities

02:15:10.159 --> 02:15:15.439
Caption: in a little bit of do this together

02:15:12.719 --> 02:15:17.520
Caption: but do it in person so i would recommend

02:15:15.439 --> 02:15:19.040
Caption: you know those nice 3m the ones with the

02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:21.599
Caption: nice glue use

02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:24.719
Caption: physical post-it notes and then

02:15:21.599 --> 02:15:26.479
Caption: write one post-it note per user story

02:15:24.719 --> 02:15:28.880
Caption: so you&#39;ve got your backlog with a long

02:15:26.479 --> 02:15:31.679
Caption: list of user stories i&#39;ve seen six seven

02:15:28.879 --> 02:15:33.359
Caption: eight hundred long story backlogs

02:15:31.679 --> 02:15:35.199
Caption: you did this to yourself write it all

02:15:33.359 --> 02:15:37.439
Caption: out okay so now we&#39;ve got post-it notes

02:15:35.199 --> 02:15:39.440
Caption: of all of our user stories

02:15:37.439 --> 02:15:41.839
Caption: in the world of user research this is

02:15:39.439 --> 02:15:43.678
Caption: activity we like to call card sorting

02:15:41.839 --> 02:15:45.439
Caption: it&#39;s typically used to sort the

02:15:43.679 --> 02:15:47.040
Caption: information architecture or the way that

02:15:45.439 --> 02:15:49.279
Caption: users navigate it&#39;s just what people

02:15:47.040 --> 02:15:51.199
Caption: commonly associate with for example

02:15:49.279 --> 02:15:53.039
Caption: features or pages or things like that

02:15:51.199 --> 02:15:55.040
Caption: and it&#39;s essentially like playing snap

02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:57.280
Caption: with your insight so what you want to do

02:15:55.040 --> 02:15:58.959
Caption: is i&#39;ve got you just start sequentially

02:15:57.279 --> 02:16:00.799
Caption: maybe even hand a couple of post-it

02:15:58.959 --> 02:16:02.959
Caption: notes out to the team do the sort of in

02:16:00.799 --> 02:16:05.198
Caption: a workshop format and say right you&#39;ve

02:16:02.959 --> 02:16:07.279
Caption: got a post-it note there read it out

02:16:05.199 --> 02:16:09.280
Caption: that&#39;s that one you go next is it the

02:16:07.279 --> 02:16:10.718
Caption: same or is it different if you&#39;re

02:16:09.279 --> 02:16:12.959
Caption: working from your product backlog

02:16:10.719 --> 02:16:14.800
Caption: sequentially first story to last it

02:16:12.959 --> 02:16:17.359
Caption: might be clear in the beginning but it

02:16:14.799 --> 02:16:19.118
Caption: might unravel towards the end so trick

02:16:17.359 --> 02:16:20.638
Caption: shuffle them up and then start fresh so

02:16:19.119 --> 02:16:22.800
Caption: we&#39;re not anchored by the thought that

02:16:20.639 --> 02:16:24.800
Caption: went into it but if if it&#39;s good thought

02:16:22.799 --> 02:16:26.879
Caption: keep it work from the top so just do

02:16:24.799 --> 02:16:28.638
Caption: what&#39;s right for your team but over time

02:16:26.879 --> 02:16:31.599
Caption: what&#39;s going to emerge are these

02:16:28.639 --> 02:16:32.399
Caption: hopefully organic hopefully intuitive

02:16:31.599 --> 02:16:33.200
Caption: groups

02:16:32.399 --> 02:16:35.439
Caption: of

02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:37.759
Caption: um sets of features and that&#39;s what can

02:16:35.439 --> 02:16:40.080
Caption: start forming the headers of your

02:16:37.759 --> 02:16:42.558
Caption: feature tree so my biggest tip i can

02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:43.359
Caption: give you as well steal from what&#39;s real

02:16:42.558 --> 02:16:45.518
Caption: yo

02:16:43.359 --> 02:16:47.280
Caption: so you&#39;ve got if it&#39;s an existing

02:16:45.518 --> 02:16:48.879
Caption: product you can probably already

02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:51.200
Caption: navigate through it so it&#39;s got a home

02:16:48.879 --> 02:16:53.438
Caption: page it&#39;s got in the up example a

02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:55.359
Caption: payments page an information section

02:16:53.439 --> 02:16:57.760
Caption: it&#39;s got all of that already if you&#39;re

02:16:55.359 --> 02:16:59.120
Caption: struggling to synthesize that&#39;s the word

02:16:57.759 --> 02:17:00.638
Caption: we use to gather thought if you&#39;re

02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:02.959
Caption: struggling to synthesize all of these

02:17:00.638 --> 02:17:05.120
Caption: post-it notes into mass

02:17:02.959 --> 02:17:06.638
Caption: sort of adopted or intuitive headings

02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:08.160
Caption: just take from what you have it&#39;s

02:17:06.638 --> 02:17:09.678
Caption: perfectly fine

02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:11.120
Caption: if you&#39;re designing a more internal

02:17:09.678 --> 02:17:12.398
Caption: facing product and it&#39;s a business

02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:14.559
Caption: process like a

02:17:12.399 --> 02:17:16.240
Caption: nifty little payroll chatbot or one of

02:17:14.558 --> 02:17:17.919
Caption: those cool ideas people come up with all

02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:19.759
Caption: the time you might just have steps to

02:17:17.919 --> 02:17:22.000
Caption: your approval process just leverage

02:17:19.759 --> 02:17:23.839
Caption: what&#39;s real start there and over time

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:27.280
Caption: allow your tree to

02:17:23.839 --> 02:17:29.358
Caption: grow so we&#39;ve got the next one

02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:31.120
Caption: focus now specifically for example on

02:17:29.359 --> 02:17:32.880
Caption: the pile of the green post-it notes

02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:34.718
Caption: that&#39;s just an arbitrary visual example

02:17:32.879 --> 02:17:37.358
Caption: but we&#39;ve got a set this is a feature

02:17:34.718 --> 02:17:38.638
Caption: we&#39;re focusing on that feature now is

02:17:37.359 --> 02:17:41.280
Caption: the good time

02:17:38.638 --> 02:17:43.120
Caption: to ask does this actually make sense so

02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:45.120
Caption: we&#39;ve got a feature let&#39;s use the up

02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:46.799
Caption: example again payments

02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:49.040
Caption: they may want to integrate in future

02:17:46.799 --> 02:17:50.959
Caption: with more payment platforms add new

02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:52.879
Caption: stories it&#39;s not detailed stories i&#39;m

02:17:50.959 --> 02:17:55.678
Caption: not talking about all of the requirement

02:17:52.879 --> 02:17:57.358
Caption: gatherings i&#39;m just mentioning a mental

02:17:55.678 --> 02:17:58.558
Caption: placeholder for all the things you still

02:17:57.359 --> 02:18:00.080
Caption: want to add to that feature because

02:17:58.558 --> 02:18:02.080
Caption: that&#39;s a bit more representative of what

02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:04.558
Caption: you want to do in that space and at the

02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:07.120
Caption: same time if there&#39;s monkey business in

02:18:04.558 --> 02:18:08.558
Caption: there just cut it just get rid of it

02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:11.040
Caption: it&#39;s probably the hardest thing to do

02:18:08.558 --> 02:18:12.959
Caption: for people to separate with just this

02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:14.558
Caption: legacy things that every new team

02:18:12.959 --> 02:18:16.799
Caption: there&#39;s just that bottom of the stale

02:18:14.558 --> 02:18:18.879
Caption: bottom of the backlog just get rid of it

02:18:16.799 --> 02:18:20.959
Caption: if you&#39;re not comfortable trashing it

02:18:18.879 --> 02:18:23.200
Caption: completely put it in a section like

02:18:20.959 --> 02:18:24.558
Caption: de-prioritized maybe there is not going

02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:26.639
Caption: to be that investment that&#39;s going to

02:18:24.558 --> 02:18:28.799
Caption: unlock a new platform that allows that

02:18:26.638 --> 02:18:30.799
Caption: feature to then become prioritized hold

02:18:28.799 --> 02:18:32.718
Caption: on to it especially if there is some

02:18:30.799 --> 02:18:34.478
Caption: usable discovery that&#39;s been done on it

02:18:32.718 --> 02:18:35.678
Caption: or prototypes or things like that hold

02:18:34.478 --> 02:18:36.959
Caption: on to it

02:18:35.678 --> 02:18:39.120
Caption: you can do that

02:18:36.959 --> 02:18:40.879
Caption: again with your entire team present i

02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:43.040
Caption: would highly recommend

02:18:40.879 --> 02:18:44.240
Caption: at least representatives of all those

02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:45.919
Caption: groups that i&#39;ve mentioned before

02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:48.160
Caption: because then we can start that

02:18:45.919 --> 02:18:50.398
Caption: conversation but what it does it it

02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:52.799
Caption: builds context of the content in the

02:18:50.399 --> 02:18:54.399
Caption: backlog really nicely it could take a

02:18:52.799 --> 02:18:56.478
Caption: bit of time if you&#39;ve got a really

02:18:54.399 --> 02:18:58.559
Caption: really big product and but stagger it

02:18:56.478 --> 02:19:00.879
Caption: maybe have a focus session for each of

02:18:58.558 --> 02:19:03.040
Caption: these features so you stagger them out

02:19:00.879 --> 02:19:06.319
Caption: and lastly now pull it together simple

02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:08.399
Caption: right easy so this is not a talk about

02:19:06.319 --> 02:19:10.479
Caption: prioritization that&#39;s a whole separate

02:19:08.399 --> 02:19:12.479
Caption: talk so how we go about prioritizing

02:19:10.478 --> 02:19:14.879
Caption: stories but let&#39;s look at the output of

02:19:12.478 --> 02:19:16.638
Caption: prioritization that is the order in

02:19:14.879 --> 02:19:19.120
Caption: which we&#39;re doing things

02:19:16.638 --> 02:19:21.358
Caption: per feature so that&#39;s where the order of

02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:24.240
Caption: the feature street feature tree starts

02:19:21.359 --> 02:19:26.080
Caption: coming in what are we doing first from a

02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:27.919
Caption: specific feature organize that top to

02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:30.558
Caption: bottom and then left to right on your

02:19:27.919 --> 02:19:32.319
Caption: feature that could be hint onto the user

02:19:30.558 --> 02:19:34.478
Caption: journey it could be hinged onto the

02:19:32.319 --> 02:19:36.639
Caption: highest value features or the features

02:19:34.478 --> 02:19:38.398
Caption: that have the earliest milestone date

02:19:36.638 --> 02:19:39.919
Caption: whatever order makes sense for you so

02:19:38.399 --> 02:19:42.000
Caption: we&#39;ve got all of our green post-it notes

02:19:39.919 --> 02:19:43.919
Caption: and we order them and all of our other

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:46.080
Caption: buckets everyone loves sort of a junk

02:19:43.919 --> 02:19:47.359
Caption: drawer have an other bucket be kind to

02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:48.719
Caption: yourself

02:19:47.359 --> 02:19:51.200
Caption: when you&#39;re pulling this together that

02:19:48.719 --> 02:19:52.799
Caption: little asterisk if you spotted it

02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:54.879
Caption: that&#39;s the things to keep in mind so

02:19:52.799 --> 02:19:57.679
Caption: lots of words on a slide here sorry not

02:19:54.879 --> 02:20:00.319
Caption: sorry so the first thing to do is who is

02:19:57.679 --> 02:20:02.318
Caption: your audience of your feature tree don&#39;t

02:20:00.319 --> 02:20:04.319
Caption: be too ambitious because that puts

02:20:02.319 --> 02:20:05.680
Caption: pressure of making something like this

02:20:04.319 --> 02:20:08.319
Caption: i&#39;ll acknowledge that it is a bit of

02:20:05.679 --> 02:20:10.478
Caption: manual effort to get started at first

02:20:08.319 --> 02:20:12.160
Caption: this is 2022. who knows maybe it&#39;s the

02:20:10.478 --> 02:20:14.318
Caption: next feature for them to work on saying

02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:15.919
Caption: jira to have the ability if you sort

02:20:14.319 --> 02:20:17.600
Caption: your stories right to automate something

02:20:15.919 --> 02:20:18.719
Caption: like this wouldn&#39;t this be awesome so

02:20:17.599 --> 02:20:20.559
Caption: we&#39;re going to look back at this talk

02:20:18.719 --> 02:20:23.599
Caption: and be like oh that&#39;s the cassette tape

02:20:20.559 --> 02:20:25.119
Caption: or the floppy disk of 2022. so but

02:20:23.599 --> 02:20:26.879
Caption: decide who is the audience of your

02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:28.639
Caption: feature tree in app&#39;s case they went

02:20:26.879 --> 02:20:30.319
Caption: bold they said it&#39;s the public we want

02:20:28.639 --> 02:20:32.239
Caption: to keep ourselves accountable to that

02:20:30.319 --> 02:20:34.319
Caption: that&#39;s the kind of product centered or

02:20:32.240 --> 02:20:37.120
Caption: cultured that we want to try for but if

02:20:34.319 --> 02:20:38.800
Caption: you&#39;ve got to leave a leave booking

02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:41.040
Caption: chatbots you probably won&#39;t do that so

02:20:38.799 --> 02:20:42.879
Caption: just start small be humble

02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:44.639
Caption: be you know begin small

02:20:42.879 --> 02:20:46.719
Caption: and then answer the next question is it

02:20:44.639 --> 02:20:48.719
Caption: at the right level of detail

02:20:46.719 --> 02:20:50.318
Caption: we&#39;ve got on your feature tree typically

02:20:48.719 --> 02:20:53.040
Caption: it&#39;s the product you might want to go

02:20:50.319 --> 02:20:55.840
Caption: epics and then a list of features a

02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:57.759
Caption: branch for each story or we&#39;ve got even

02:20:55.839 --> 02:20:59.919
Caption: a lower level of detail to a story could

02:20:57.759 --> 02:21:02.559
Caption: be something like a task depending on

02:20:59.919 --> 02:21:04.719
Caption: what structure if there&#39;s test steps you

02:21:02.559 --> 02:21:07.040
Caption: might sometimes use as a task in your as

02:21:04.719 --> 02:21:09.200
Caption: your backlog for example decide what&#39;s

02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:11.520
Caption: right for the team

02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:13.200
Caption: don&#39;t start too detailed we love detail

02:21:11.519 --> 02:21:15.279
Caption: when we start something because we just

02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:17.439
Caption: want that confidence that it is in there

02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:19.200
Caption: but if we are engaged in the process

02:21:17.439 --> 02:21:21.280
Caption: it&#39;s okay to drop some of the detail off

02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:22.479
Caption: and just visualize it so then we need to

02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:24.799
Caption: answer

02:21:22.478 --> 02:21:26.799
Caption: what format is right designers in the

02:21:24.799 --> 02:21:28.559
Caption: room don&#39;t do it in illustrator because

02:21:26.799 --> 02:21:29.679
Caption: then you automatically become the owner

02:21:28.559 --> 02:21:32.000
Caption: because you&#39;re the only one that can

02:21:29.679 --> 02:21:33.519
Caption: edit it use a tool that is easily

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.839
Caption: editable so like

02:21:33.519 --> 02:21:38.318
Caption: a mural of the world or i say myro you

02:21:35.839 --> 02:21:39.599
Caption: say mirror or fig jam there&#39;s lots of

02:21:38.319 --> 02:21:41.919
Caption: online whiteboarding tools that&#39;s

02:21:39.599 --> 02:21:43.679
Caption: actually quite accessible to use it&#39;s

02:21:41.919 --> 02:21:46.319
Caption: shareable with the url you can make it

02:21:43.679 --> 02:21:48.639
Caption: sort of semi-public and you can just

02:21:46.319 --> 02:21:50.479
Caption: change the post-it notes as they go

02:21:48.639 --> 02:21:52.239
Caption: the last two is also related to one

02:21:50.478 --> 02:21:54.159
Caption: another is who will own it you might

02:21:52.240 --> 02:21:56.080
Caption: think that it&#39;s intuitive for a single

02:21:54.160 --> 02:21:58.240
Caption: person to own it like a product owner

02:21:56.080 --> 02:22:00.479
Caption: you own a product you know you own it

02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:03.120
Caption: you update it it&#39;s a lot of work if you

02:22:00.478 --> 02:22:05.279
Caption: not maintaining it so if it&#39;s just a map

02:22:03.120 --> 02:22:06.879
Caption: if it&#39;s just a point in time document

02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:09.200
Caption: you can probably go a bit detailed but

02:22:06.879 --> 02:22:11.200
Caption: acknowledge that save it as a pdf don&#39;t

02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:12.479
Caption: even tempt people to think it&#39;s quickly

02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:14.640
Caption: editable because there is a lot of

02:22:12.478 --> 02:22:16.000
Caption: detail on it i will acknowledge but if

02:22:14.639 --> 02:22:18.478
Caption: it is something that you&#39;re embedding

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:20.319
Caption: for example in your agile ceremonies so

02:22:18.478 --> 02:22:22.159
Caption: for example a common two-week sprint

02:22:20.319 --> 02:22:24.160
Caption: structure at the end you might have a

02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:26.719
Caption: bit of a showcase ta-da these are all

02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:28.640
Caption: the stuff we did we thought we would do

02:22:26.719 --> 02:22:30.559
Caption: we didn&#39;t get through it&#39;s at that point

02:22:28.639 --> 02:22:32.000
Caption: in time if it&#39;s hopefully set up in a

02:22:30.559 --> 02:22:34.159
Caption: format where you can just quickly change

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:35.839
Caption: the colors of the post-it notes maybe

02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:38.240
Caption: once a month move the order if things

02:22:35.839 --> 02:22:40.318
Caption: change but if we embed it in our agile

02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:42.160
Caption: ceremonies it&#39;s a really nice way to

02:22:40.319 --> 02:22:43.840
Caption: start a sprint showcase especially if

02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:45.919
Caption: there are broader stakeholders in that

02:22:43.839 --> 02:22:47.519
Caption: group i said the word so if there&#39;s

02:22:45.919 --> 02:22:49.200
Caption: other people in the

02:22:47.519 --> 02:22:51.279
Caption: showcase that might not have the lowest

02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:52.000
Caption: level of detail oh so where are we on

02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:53.839
Caption: the

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:56.160
Caption: chat bot and then you could say cool

02:22:53.839 --> 02:22:57.919
Caption: we&#39;ve started that for example visually

02:22:56.160 --> 02:22:58.719
Caption: and then go into the more detail which

02:22:57.919 --> 02:23:00.478
Caption: is

02:22:58.719 --> 02:23:01.759
Caption: yeah sharing some of that so i&#39;ll speed

02:23:00.478 --> 02:23:03.679
Caption: up a bit so

02:23:01.759 --> 02:23:06.080
Caption: now we&#39;re working with a new

02:23:03.679 --> 02:23:08.559
Caption: backlog a new product we&#39;ve just done

02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:10.959
Caption: discovery there is a brand new shiny

02:23:08.559 --> 02:23:12.799
Caption: prototype how do we stare at a blank

02:23:10.959 --> 02:23:14.879
Caption: screen and go where do we start that&#39;s

02:23:12.799 --> 02:23:16.240
Caption: very intimidating i&#39;ll admit even for me

02:23:14.879 --> 02:23:19.120
Caption: so

02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:20.799
Caption: the five ease of service design like if

02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:22.479
Caption: this is an educational talk this is the

02:23:20.799 --> 02:23:24.879
Caption: thing i might expose you to who knows

02:23:22.478 --> 02:23:26.799
Caption: but the five ease of service design is

02:23:24.879 --> 02:23:29.200
Caption: just a construct that service designers

02:23:26.799 --> 02:23:31.438
Caption: like myself use to navigate a user

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:33.280
Caption: journey and spoilers it&#39;s so simple so

02:23:31.439 --> 02:23:36.240
Caption: hopefully you can use some of it before

02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:38.080
Caption: i jump into what they are and we again

02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:39.759
Caption: you map out the user journey and how to

02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:41.520
Caption: translate that to a backlog i just want

02:23:39.759 --> 02:23:43.358
Caption: to share an example

02:23:41.519 --> 02:23:45.199
Caption: i want to say again deliberately low

02:23:43.359 --> 02:23:46.880
Caption: quality but i didn&#39;t have access to this

02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:49.120
Caption: anymore so i just took a screenshot of

02:23:46.879 --> 02:23:52.639
Caption: what i have but here what we&#39;ll see is a

02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:55.280
Caption: problem that we solved for a wi insurer

02:23:52.639 --> 02:23:56.799
Caption: so what they were trying to do is

02:23:55.280 --> 02:23:59.040
Caption: release functionality so that their

02:23:56.799 --> 02:24:02.000
Caption: users can cancel their insurance policy

02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:04.719
Caption: online no questions asked go in press

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:06.399
Caption: cancel it&#39;s done instant refund in our

02:24:04.719 --> 02:24:07.839
Caption: research what is really awesome is

02:24:06.399 --> 02:24:09.280
Caption: there&#39;s no other insurer to our

02:24:07.839 --> 02:24:11.839
Caption: knowledge that allows you to do that in

02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:13.280
Caption: australia so represent wa which is

02:24:11.839 --> 02:24:14.959
Caption: awesome

02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:16.879
Caption: but we needed to design for an

02:24:14.959 --> 02:24:19.438
Caption: experience here and after we had our

02:24:16.879 --> 02:24:20.799
Caption: prototype we were able to arrive semi at

02:24:19.439 --> 02:24:22.560
Caption: this point so i&#39;ll step you through some

02:24:20.799 --> 02:24:24.639
Caption: of the detail and then i&#39;ll get to the

02:24:22.559 --> 02:24:26.079
Caption: five is how you can remember the

02:24:24.639 --> 02:24:28.799
Caption: structure for yourself if you&#39;re trying

02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:31.120
Caption: to do something like this so on the left

02:24:28.799 --> 02:24:33.120
Caption: that first feature this is a working

02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:34.879
Caption: draft the early days the ugly version of

02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:36.639
Caption: a feature tree and that&#39;s okay i don&#39;t

02:24:34.879 --> 02:24:38.240
Caption: even think we iterated the fidelity

02:24:36.639 --> 02:24:40.398
Caption: after this we kind of just kept it kind

02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:43.120
Caption: of there it served its purpose

02:24:40.399 --> 02:24:45.439
Caption: access how do users get into this

02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:47.759
Caption: experience let&#39;s talk about it as a form

02:24:45.439 --> 02:24:49.520
Caption: so how do users access this cancellation

02:24:47.759 --> 02:24:51.679
Caption: form so these are all the things we&#39;re

02:24:49.519 --> 02:24:54.079
Caption: considering today they&#39;ve got a platform

02:24:51.679 --> 02:24:56.559
Caption: a portal you can log into let&#39;s leverage

02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:58.080
Caption: a cancel button there lots of cool ideas

02:24:56.559 --> 02:25:00.318
Caption: we have in the future but we stagger

02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:03.200
Caption: them out focus on priority first

02:25:00.319 --> 02:25:04.879
Caption: the next four so the view policy details

02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:06.640
Caption: of course you want to be sure you&#39;re

02:25:04.879 --> 02:25:08.559
Caption: canceling the right policy so let&#39;s pull

02:25:06.639 --> 02:25:10.318
Caption: up that information that&#39;s where the

02:25:08.559 --> 02:25:11.679
Caption: interesting stuff starts presenting

02:25:10.319 --> 02:25:12.959
Caption: information in a simple way that&#39;s

02:25:11.679 --> 02:25:14.799
Caption: relevant to that place you&#39;ve just

02:25:12.959 --> 02:25:16.959
Caption: clicked from you want to select the

02:25:14.799 --> 02:25:18.799
Caption: cancellation reason this is not just an

02:25:16.959 --> 02:25:20.719
Caption: information grab it depends on the

02:25:18.799 --> 02:25:22.478
Caption: reason you&#39;re canceling depends on your

02:25:20.719 --> 02:25:24.398
Caption: refund and the terms and conditions and

02:25:22.478 --> 02:25:26.478
Caption: stuff like that it also helps the

02:25:24.399 --> 02:25:28.720
Caption: customer service of course then there&#39;s

02:25:26.478 --> 02:25:30.639
Caption: the date and the refund so we want to

02:25:28.719 --> 02:25:32.318
Caption: know when are you canceled from

02:25:30.639 --> 02:25:34.080
Caption: depending on your reason there&#39;s some

02:25:32.319 --> 02:25:34.800
Caption: rules and depending on

02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:36.719
Caption: what

02:25:34.799 --> 02:25:38.318
Caption: what kind of policy you have your refund

02:25:36.719 --> 02:25:40.639
Caption: amount might look different shout out to

02:25:38.319 --> 02:25:43.040
Caption: my boomers some of them pay cash once a

02:25:40.639 --> 02:25:46.239
Caption: year that&#39;s a whole other refund journey

02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:47.679
Caption: than the online credit card ones so for

02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:49.280
Caption: example these are all the things we

02:25:47.679 --> 02:25:50.879
Caption: needed to navigate and like right

02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:52.799
Caption: there&#39;s you know lots of different user

02:25:50.879 --> 02:25:54.959
Caption: groups and things like that editing your

02:25:52.799 --> 02:25:57.200
Caption: details might as well you&#39;re there and

02:25:54.959 --> 02:25:59.599
Caption: in the confirmation so what i&#39;m taking

02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:02.080
Caption: you through is the user journey of for

02:25:59.599 --> 02:26:04.239
Caption: example the end result of our discovery

02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:06.560
Caption: and that&#39;s how we chunked it up

02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:08.879
Caption: for our backlog so if you want the

02:26:06.559 --> 02:26:10.478
Caption: ability to recall or replicate something

02:26:08.879 --> 02:26:12.240
Caption: like this for yourself

02:26:10.478 --> 02:26:13.839
Caption: this is where the five ease of service

02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:16.000
Caption: design come in i&#39;m not starting at the

02:26:13.839 --> 02:26:18.160
Caption: first one i&#39;ll tell you in a second why

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.399
Caption: but let&#39;s go with that second one enter

02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:23.120
Caption: every journey starts somewhere right our

02:26:20.399 --> 02:26:25.359
Caption: first pillar was purely this is a user

02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:27.520
Caption: based or a user journey based feature

02:26:25.359 --> 02:26:29.600
Caption: tree how do we access our experience

02:26:27.519 --> 02:26:32.398
Caption: what&#39;s that entry point and we already

02:26:29.599 --> 02:26:34.239
Caption: said there&#39;s existing portal our initial

02:26:32.399 --> 02:26:37.280
Caption: release the minimum viable product hate

02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:38.479
Caption: that word um is we&#39;re just pressing a

02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:39.600
Caption: button and we&#39;re entering that

02:26:38.478 --> 02:26:41.438
Caption: experience and that&#39;s why it&#39;s at the

02:26:39.599 --> 02:26:43.358
Caption: top enter

02:26:41.439 --> 02:26:44.479
Caption: the next four like i mentioned that&#39;s

02:26:43.359 --> 02:26:46.399
Caption: engage

02:26:44.478 --> 02:26:48.239
Caption: so any user journey again that you&#39;ll go

02:26:46.399 --> 02:26:49.920
Caption: through in life as these characters

02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:51.520
Caption: engage that&#39;s the core of it so you&#39;ll

02:26:49.919 --> 02:26:53.359
Caption: probably have quite a few features in it

02:26:51.519 --> 02:26:56.159
Caption: if it&#39;s a form it&#39;s the pages of the

02:26:53.359 --> 02:26:58.399
Caption: form if it&#39;s uh leave booking chat but

02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:00.719
Caption: it&#39;s the approval stage gates whatever

02:26:58.399 --> 02:27:02.959
Caption: you need like i&#39;ve already mentioned

02:27:00.719 --> 02:27:05.279
Caption: every feature that exists has stories

02:27:02.959 --> 02:27:07.200
Caption: associated with it and then finally your

02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:09.120
Caption: confirmations your exits beginning

02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:11.600
Caption: middle end

02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:13.839
Caption: and enter engage exit those three

02:27:11.599 --> 02:27:15.438
Caption: they&#39;re the core so i like to think of

02:27:13.839 --> 02:27:17.919
Caption: the exits as your planned and your

02:27:15.439 --> 02:27:19.840
Caption: unplanned successes and failures so

02:27:17.919 --> 02:27:21.519
Caption: what&#39;s your plan success cool that&#39;s

02:27:19.839 --> 02:27:23.839
Caption: just a confirmation message you&#39;re

02:27:21.519 --> 02:27:25.599
Caption: getting almost all of your money back in

02:27:23.839 --> 02:27:28.478
Caption: seven days awesome you get the text

02:27:25.599 --> 02:27:30.239
Caption: message for reinsurance fantastic or the

02:27:28.478 --> 02:27:32.159
Caption: unplanned failures could be your error

02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:34.080
Caption: messages you need that to go live of

02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:36.160
Caption: course day one but there&#39;s other cool

02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:38.160
Caption: things later down the line office in

02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:39.839
Caption: service design we find a little bit of

02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:41.759
Caption: back of house manual stuff we&#39;re willing

02:27:39.839 --> 02:27:43.438
Caption: to cope with to release this to test if

02:27:41.759 --> 02:27:45.358
Caption: people actually want to use it and over

02:27:43.439 --> 02:27:47.439
Caption: time we might invest in automating some

02:27:45.359 --> 02:27:48.399
Caption: of that and that&#39;s where the book ends

02:27:47.439 --> 02:27:50.160
Caption: come in

02:27:48.399 --> 02:27:52.720
Caption: entice an extend

02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:54.399
Caption: don&#39;t like to start at entice and extend

02:27:52.719 --> 02:27:56.160
Caption: because that&#39;s usually when the big

02:27:54.399 --> 02:27:57.920
Caption: picture thinkers get really excited what

02:27:56.160 --> 02:28:00.000
Caption: are all the cool ways we can attract

02:27:57.919 --> 02:28:01.599
Caption: users to these features and extend what

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:03.280
Caption: are all the ways that we can make a

02:28:01.599 --> 02:28:05.199
Caption: linear journey or a product journey

02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:07.760
Caption: circular and things like that don&#39;t

02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:09.439
Caption: start there but acknowledge that these

02:28:07.759 --> 02:28:11.839
Caption: are typically from my experience at

02:28:09.439 --> 02:28:14.000
Caption: least lower down the priority list when

02:28:11.839 --> 02:28:16.240
Caption: we&#39;re launching new functionality

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:18.399
Caption: constantly re-prioritize but entice how

02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:19.359
Caption: do we get more users to that journey and

02:28:18.399 --> 02:28:21.200
Caption: extend

02:28:19.359 --> 02:28:22.880
Caption: now what do we want to automate more

02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:24.080
Caption: what does this unlock that kind of

02:28:22.879 --> 02:28:25.679
Caption: thinking

02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:28.479
Caption: so just

02:28:25.679 --> 02:28:30.239
Caption: teaching by sheer repetition the five

02:28:28.478 --> 02:28:32.799
Caption: ease of service design start in that

02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:34.319
Caption: middle beginning middle and end then i

02:28:32.799 --> 02:28:37.358
Caption: would say answer those questions what

02:28:34.319 --> 02:28:39.760
Caption: comes before and what comes after so if

02:28:37.359 --> 02:28:42.959
Caption: we&#39;ve got a user journey that is usually

02:28:39.759 --> 02:28:45.040
Caption: how we can look at our prototype

02:28:42.959 --> 02:28:47.120
Caption: now cut slice that&#39;s where the knife

02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:48.719
Caption: comes in slice the prototype in that

02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:50.160
Caption: user journey how does it answer that

02:28:48.719 --> 02:28:52.160
Caption: question and then we look at the

02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:53.359
Caption: experience and do the story breakdown

02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:54.879
Caption: from there

02:28:53.359 --> 02:28:56.479
Caption: so what we&#39;re looking at here like i&#39;ve

02:28:54.879 --> 02:28:58.240
Caption: mentioned already is at the beginning of

02:28:56.478 --> 02:28:59.919
Caption: a feature tree all of the smaller

02:28:58.240 --> 02:29:01.600
Caption: post-it notes they&#39;re color-coded for

02:28:59.919 --> 02:29:03.200
Caption: various reasons like still needs

02:29:01.599 --> 02:29:05.040
Caption: discovery that&#39;s a different team that&#39;s

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:06.640
Caption: where we blocked by a platform but at

02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:08.080
Caption: the very least

02:29:06.639 --> 02:29:10.239
Caption: and this is the other way it&#39;s the first

02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:12.879
Caption: time i&#39;ve tried this so bonus coronalism

02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:14.399
Caption: for you why not roadmap it so we mapped

02:29:12.879 --> 02:29:15.759
Caption: out this is the core piece of

02:29:14.399 --> 02:29:18.080
Caption: functionality we&#39;re going to go live

02:29:15.759 --> 02:29:20.000
Caption: with day one what is the second release

02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:22.000
Caption: look like you want more but yeah the

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Caption: second release or the phase after that

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:26.160
Caption: and where are we just scoped where&#39;s our

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.240
Caption: save for later bucket and that&#39;s how we

02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:30.640
Caption: use the feature tree to give that

02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:33.280
Caption: product vision and then we can create

02:29:30.639 --> 02:29:35.040
Caption: the backlog from here and then we&#39;ve got

02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:36.640
Caption: structure in the backlog you can tag

02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:38.879
Caption: your backlog then with your feature

02:29:36.639 --> 02:29:41.438
Caption: flags or things like that and color code

02:29:38.879 --> 02:29:43.438
Caption: it and these artifacts will continue if

02:29:41.439 --> 02:29:45.600
Caption: you update your feature tree they live

02:29:43.439 --> 02:29:46.960
Caption: together you update the feature tree you

02:29:45.599 --> 02:29:48.959
Caption: update your backlog you update your

02:29:46.959 --> 02:29:51.919
Caption: backlog you update your feature tree so

02:29:48.959 --> 02:29:53.438
Caption: in high periods of change pause the one

02:29:51.919 --> 02:29:55.040
Caption: definitely sort the house out sort the

02:29:53.439 --> 02:29:56.800
Caption: backlog out or sort the feature tree out

02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:58.080
Caption: which one you&#39;re more dominant in and

02:29:56.799 --> 02:29:59.839
Caption: then make sure that the other one

02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:01.679
Caption: reflects this change because then we can

02:29:59.839 --> 02:30:02.559
Caption: navigate between the two

02:30:01.679 --> 02:30:04.719
Caption: so

02:30:02.559 --> 02:30:06.639
Caption: i made y&#39;all a template so this is just

02:30:04.719 --> 02:30:08.959
Caption: a basic powerpoint template a lot of

02:30:06.639 --> 02:30:10.879
Caption: what you saw today is um just powerpoint

02:30:08.959 --> 02:30:13.200
Caption: templates it&#39;s not overly fancy so i&#39;ve

02:30:10.879 --> 02:30:14.879
Caption: created one hopefully this qr code still

02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:16.719
Caption: works from overnight i&#39;ve not tested it

02:30:14.879 --> 02:30:18.478
Caption: this morning and this qr code is only

02:30:16.719 --> 02:30:19.919
Caption: going to be live today so shout out to

02:30:18.478 --> 02:30:22.159
Caption: the future if you&#39;re watching this it&#39;s

02:30:19.919 --> 02:30:24.240
Caption: not going to work so

02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:26.160
Caption: i&#39;ll send you a couple of resources i&#39;ll

02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:29.919
Caption: of the five years of service design in

02:30:29.919 --> 02:30:33.519
Caption: template that i&#39;ve made it&#39;s also on the

02:30:31.519 --> 02:30:35.119
Caption: next slide so i&#39;m going to move on i&#39;ve

02:30:33.519 --> 02:30:37.279
Caption: i&#39;ve been given my five minute time

02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:39.359
Caption: warning sorry if i went a bit over but

02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:41.520
Caption: at this point i might say thank you

02:30:39.359 --> 02:30:43.040
Caption: again for the 900th time and ask if

02:30:41.519 --> 02:30:45.279
Caption: you&#39;ve got any questions and hopefully

02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:46.719
Caption: we can navigate that or i&#39;ll be probably

02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:49.680
Caption: throughout today at the telstra purple

02:30:46.719 --> 02:30:52.959
Caption: booth if you want to have a chat so

02:30:49.679 --> 02:30:56.398
Caption: any questions any opportunities

02:30:52.959 --> 02:30:56.399
Caption: it&#39;s all good we&#39;ve got a question here

02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:03.839
Caption: what is my favorite tool to work in for

02:31:01.359 --> 02:31:06.479
Caption: feature trees it really depends

02:31:03.839 --> 02:31:08.080
Caption: on the project story time the most

02:31:06.478 --> 02:31:09.919
Caption: recent feature to you i&#39;ve created was

02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:12.319
Caption: in excel because our product owner

02:31:09.919 --> 02:31:14.879
Caption: absolutely loved excel so it has the

02:31:12.319 --> 02:31:16.879
Caption: ability to filter and sort and

02:31:14.879 --> 02:31:19.120
Caption: give details and if you export a backlog

02:31:16.879 --> 02:31:21.120
Caption: so for example in our case azure devops

02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:23.600
Caption: it already is in a similar format so you

02:31:21.120 --> 02:31:26.160
Caption: can manipulate that csv for that run

02:31:23.599 --> 02:31:27.759
Caption: reporting off of it it intimidates some

02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:29.679
Caption: team members because they&#39;re allergic to

02:31:27.759 --> 02:31:31.279
Caption: excel and that&#39;s okay so then at that

02:31:29.679 --> 02:31:32.398
Caption: point my experience is you make the

02:31:31.280 --> 02:31:34.959
Caption: trade-off

02:31:32.399 --> 02:31:37.280
Caption: i love the online whiteboarding tools i

02:31:34.959 --> 02:31:38.160
Caption: work from home so for me it&#39;s an easy

02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:39.839
Caption: place

02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:42.399
Caption: if you can convince someone to just go

02:31:39.839 --> 02:31:44.478
Caption: in and use it it&#39;s usually just show me

02:31:42.399 --> 02:31:46.160
Caption: how you do it then they&#39;ll get into it

02:31:44.478 --> 02:31:47.679
Caption: and see how easy it is and if they&#39;re

02:31:46.160 --> 02:31:48.799
Caption: convinced that it&#39;s that easy then they

02:31:47.679 --> 02:31:50.559
Caption: will but if you tell them you&#39;re going

02:31:48.799 --> 02:31:53.040
Caption: to use a new tool they might be a bit

02:31:50.559 --> 02:31:54.639
Caption: antsy but luckily for us i guess in our

02:31:53.040 --> 02:31:58.080
Caption: process it&#39;s already embedded that

02:31:54.639 --> 02:31:59.839
Caption: specific tool if you can work online but

02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:02.639
Caption: almost flipping the question don&#39;t let

02:31:59.839 --> 02:32:04.478
Caption: the tool block you so an excel can be a

02:32:02.639 --> 02:32:06.159
Caption: bit feature oh sorry a powerpoint can be

02:32:04.478 --> 02:32:07.759
Caption: quite fidgety if you&#39;re moving a lot of

02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:08.719
Caption: group boxes around it&#39;s no one&#39;s

02:32:07.759 --> 02:32:10.799
Caption: favorite

02:32:08.719 --> 02:32:12.799
Caption: choose an easy tool like a

02:32:10.799 --> 02:32:14.000
Caption: the mirrors of the world or they&#39;re

02:32:12.799 --> 02:32:16.639
Caption: quite easy

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:17.679
Caption: i find

02:32:16.639 --> 02:32:19.199
Caption: awesome

02:32:17.679 --> 02:32:20.398
Caption: there&#39;s a sorry i want to also mention

02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:22.319
Caption: on that note

02:32:20.399 --> 02:32:24.479
Caption: if you take an excel spreadsheet and you

02:32:22.319 --> 02:32:26.560
Caption: copy all the cells you have two windows

02:32:24.478 --> 02:32:28.239
Caption: and you drag the excel cells over to

02:32:26.559 --> 02:32:30.159
Caption: mirror it just creates post-it notes for

02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:31.439
Caption: you it&#39;s a wickedly fast feature you&#39;ll

02:32:30.160 --> 02:32:33.359
Caption: probably only believe it if you see it

02:32:31.439 --> 02:32:35.600
Caption: but it&#39;s that quick it&#39;s actually really

02:32:33.359 --> 02:32:37.600
Caption: cool so try it next time drag your

02:32:35.599 --> 02:32:39.279
Caption: stories into these whiteboarding tools

02:32:37.599 --> 02:32:40.959
Caption: do you have time for one more question

02:56:16.719 --> 02:56:22.879
Caption: around helping these awesome folks who

02:56:19.359 --> 02:56:24.959
Caption: organized this this conference and today

02:56:22.879 --> 02:56:27.120
Caption: is the first time after seven attempts i

02:56:24.959 --> 02:56:29.440
Caption: actually made it as a speaker

02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:31.919
Caption: resiliency yes

02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:34.720
Caption: [Laughter]

02:56:31.919 --> 02:56:37.599
Caption: so in today&#39;s talk you&#39;ll fall into one

02:56:34.719 --> 02:56:40.398
Caption: of three camps you&#39;ll either be in camp

02:56:37.599 --> 02:56:41.919
Caption: one where you&#39;ll think oh that&#39;s an

02:56:40.399 --> 02:56:43.120
Caption: interesting pattern never heard of that

02:56:41.919 --> 02:56:46.398
Caption: before

02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:49.520
Caption: or you&#39;ll call uh fallen camp two and

02:56:46.399 --> 02:56:52.399
Caption: you go well i i know that pattern of uh

02:56:49.519 --> 02:56:54.959
Caption: i&#39;ve implemented before but maybe not in

02:56:52.399 --> 02:56:57.920
Caption: in dot net so that&#39;s interesting or

02:56:54.959 --> 02:57:00.319
Caption: you&#39;ll fall into um camp three and

02:56:57.919 --> 02:57:02.559
Caption: you&#39;ll go like go like this oh

02:57:00.319 --> 02:57:05.279
Caption: flip not another one

02:57:02.559 --> 02:57:07.679
Caption: more on that later

02:57:05.279 --> 02:57:11.439
Caption: so for those of you who do not

02:57:07.679 --> 02:57:12.959
Caption: know me and my flicker is not working

02:57:11.439 --> 02:57:15.600
Caption: you get closer get closer get closer

02:57:12.959 --> 02:57:15.599
Caption: it&#39;s a big stage

02:57:17.359 --> 02:57:22.720
Caption: reset the clicker

02:57:19.839 --> 02:57:26.559
Caption: it&#39;s good start

02:57:22.719 --> 02:57:28.398
Caption: there we go no there we go

02:57:26.559 --> 02:57:31.040
Caption: brazilian the resilient clicker this is

02:57:28.399 --> 02:57:33.840
Caption: not um so for those of you who don&#39;t

02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:38.000
Caption: know me um i have been building software

02:57:33.839 --> 02:57:40.639
Caption: for 20 years uh i am that old yes um

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:41.679
Caption: majority in in cloud so the last seven

02:57:40.639 --> 02:57:44.239
Caption: or eight years i&#39;ve been building

02:57:41.679 --> 02:57:45.278
Caption: software in a number of different clouds

02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:47.680
Caption: um

02:57:45.279 --> 02:57:50.959
Caption: what we call cloud native so some people

02:57:47.679 --> 02:57:51.839
Caption: call cloud native um others close

02:57:50.959 --> 02:57:54.000
Caption: and

02:57:51.839 --> 02:57:56.639
Caption: for for nearly five of those years i

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:58.879
Caption: have been working at aws

02:57:56.639 --> 02:58:01.839
Caption: and the last two is developer advocate

02:57:58.879 --> 02:58:03.759
Caption: um you may notice a slight accent i am

02:58:01.839 --> 02:58:06.719
Caption: originally from ireland hence the the

02:58:03.759 --> 02:58:09.759
Caption: green shoes that i i&#39;m wearing today

02:58:06.719 --> 02:58:11.839
Caption: but i am very much perth native and have

02:58:09.759 --> 02:58:14.318
Caption: been living in this beautiful city for

02:58:11.839 --> 02:58:16.000
Caption: 15 years and i probably worked with

02:58:14.319 --> 02:58:16.840
Caption: quite a few of you in the audience so

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:19.759
Caption: i&#39;m

02:58:16.839 --> 02:58:21.358
Caption: sorry um

02:58:19.759 --> 02:58:24.318
Caption: clicker is

02:58:21.359 --> 02:58:27.520
Caption: of yes okay so a lot of people i usually

02:58:24.319 --> 02:58:28.800
Caption: start talks with um a quote

02:58:27.519 --> 02:58:31.679
Caption: and it&#39;s usually a quote by somebody

02:58:28.799 --> 02:58:34.160
Caption: else so i thought ah first ever ddd talk

02:58:31.679 --> 02:58:36.799
Caption: let&#39;s have a quote from me so a lot of

02:58:34.160 --> 02:58:39.759
Caption: people ask me derek what do you do what

02:58:36.799 --> 02:58:42.240
Caption: is a developer advocate and so this is

02:58:39.759 --> 02:58:44.318
Caption: what i say a developer advocate is i

02:58:42.240 --> 02:58:45.759
Caption: show people what i used to do

02:58:44.319 --> 02:58:47.760
Caption: for a living

02:58:45.759 --> 02:58:49.599
Caption: for a living

02:58:47.759 --> 02:58:52.160
Caption: think about it

02:58:49.599 --> 02:58:53.679
Caption: um so that&#39;s my quote and so

02:58:52.160 --> 02:58:55.679
Caption: today i&#39;m going to show you patterns

02:58:53.679 --> 02:58:58.239
Caption: that i used to implement

02:58:55.679 --> 02:58:58.239
Caption: for a living

02:58:59.200 --> 02:59:02.560
Caption: and i&#39;ll have to stay i&#39;m gonna have to

02:59:00.559 --> 02:59:05.358
Caption: stay i love i love walking the stage but

02:59:02.559 --> 02:59:05.358
Caption: my clicker&#39;s not working

02:59:05.679 --> 02:59:11.358
Caption: oh no it&#39;s okay um thanks thanks sarah

02:59:09.200 --> 02:59:12.959
Caption: so i&#39;m gonna start with another quote

02:59:11.359 --> 02:59:15.359
Caption: this is from a from a from a person a

02:59:12.959 --> 02:59:17.438
Caption: lot more famous than i am and this is

02:59:15.359 --> 02:59:20.479
Caption: the cto of uh

02:59:17.439 --> 02:59:22.240
Caption: amazon dr vernon vogels so failures are

02:59:20.478 --> 02:59:24.398
Caption: given and everything will eventually

02:59:22.240 --> 02:59:26.399
Caption: fail over time so when people hear this

02:59:24.399 --> 02:59:28.560
Caption: they&#39;re like what everything fails

02:59:26.399 --> 02:59:30.000
Caption: nonsense everything always works in my

02:59:28.559 --> 02:59:34.239
Caption: my machine

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:35.919
Caption: or or they say oh okay and that&#39;s that&#39;s

02:59:34.240 --> 02:59:38.479
Caption: the acceptance that you need

02:59:35.919 --> 02:59:39.919
Caption: failure is a thing when we build modern

02:59:38.478 --> 02:59:41.119
Caption: software applications that are

02:59:39.919 --> 02:59:43.759
Caption: distributed

02:59:41.120 --> 02:59:46.799
Caption: we build them on different platforms we

02:59:43.759 --> 02:59:49.040
Caption: go across networks that may

02:59:46.799 --> 02:59:50.879
Caption: go across boundaries of regions

02:59:49.040 --> 02:59:54.319
Caption: countries

02:59:50.879 --> 02:59:56.398
Caption: all sorts of latency introduced and they

02:59:54.319 --> 02:59:57.200
Caption: may also work on different hardware

02:59:56.399 --> 02:59:58.720
Caption: so

02:59:57.200 --> 03:00:01.439
Caption: nothing&#39;s ever going to work all the

02:59:58.719 --> 03:00:02.398
Caption: time that&#39;s ridiculous so what we need

03:00:01.439 --> 03:00:04.479
Caption: to do

03:00:02.399 --> 03:00:06.399
Caption: is when we&#39;re building software we need

03:00:04.478 --> 03:00:11.559
Caption: to take this in mind we need to build

03:00:06.399 --> 03:00:11.560
Caption: our applications to be more resilient

03:00:13.599 --> 03:00:17.919
Caption: it&#39;s terrible

03:00:15.839 --> 03:00:20.240
Caption: click

03:00:17.919 --> 03:00:21.759
Caption: so today i&#39;m going to say five patterns

03:00:20.240 --> 03:00:23.919
Caption: timeouts

03:00:21.759 --> 03:00:25.839
Caption: graceful degradations retries

03:00:23.919 --> 03:00:27.599
Caption: exponential back offs and circuit

03:00:25.839 --> 03:00:30.160
Caption: breakers and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s a

03:00:27.599 --> 03:00:31.759
Caption: progression as i build these out and

03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:33.359
Caption: then we&#39;re going to dive into one

03:00:31.759 --> 03:00:35.040
Caption: practice the practice of chaos

03:00:33.359 --> 03:00:36.560
Caption: engineering

03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:38.479
Caption: and that will become clear why we&#39;re

03:00:36.559 --> 03:00:40.959
Caption: diving into chaos engineering when we

03:00:38.478 --> 03:00:40.959
Caption: get to it

03:00:43.839 --> 03:00:48.879
Caption: so the first thing to do is meet the

03:00:46.240 --> 03:00:50.080
Caption: traditional distributed application that

03:00:48.879 --> 03:00:53.799
Caption: we&#39;re going

03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:53.799
Caption: to build today

03:00:55.519 --> 03:00:59.679
Caption: before i get into it

03:00:57.439 --> 03:01:01.200
Caption: anybody who doesn&#39;t like bad jokes you

03:00:59.679 --> 03:01:02.160
Caption: may as well leave noy because there&#39;s a

03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:06.479
Caption: lot

03:01:02.160 --> 03:01:09.040
Caption: um a lot so i&#39;m sorry i apologize

03:01:06.478 --> 03:01:11.358
Caption: but not really

03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:14.799
Caption: so this is our distributed application

03:01:11.359 --> 03:01:16.640
Caption: it is a random joke generator

03:01:14.799 --> 03:01:18.959
Caption: and here&#39;s a joke what

03:01:16.639 --> 03:01:21.599
Caption: do computers eat for snack

03:01:18.959 --> 03:01:22.639
Caption: microchips of course

03:01:21.599 --> 03:01:24.559
Caption: and

03:01:22.639 --> 03:01:28.000
Caption: if it has a

03:01:24.559 --> 03:01:30.478
Caption: saw it has a punch line and a punch line

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:32.399
Caption: and if i hit tell me another

03:01:30.478 --> 03:01:33.839
Caption: it&#39;s going to get another joke two hard

03:01:32.399 --> 03:01:36.080
Caption: things in computer science cache and

03:01:33.839 --> 03:01:38.240
Caption: validation naming things and off by one

03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:40.560
Caption: errors okay

03:01:38.240 --> 03:01:43.120
Caption: um and then if i hit the back end of

03:01:40.559 --> 03:01:45.679
Caption: this um front end i&#39;ve got a setup a

03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:49.279
Caption: punchline and a source all in json

03:01:45.679 --> 03:01:51.679
Caption: and and if i refresh it&#39;ll hit an api

03:01:49.279 --> 03:01:53.439
Caption: that will give me a result and that&#39;s

03:01:51.679 --> 03:01:56.080
Caption: the application so if we look at the

03:01:53.439 --> 03:01:58.080
Caption: code itself i have a client app so the

03:01:56.080 --> 03:02:00.879
Caption: client lab is a react app which is

03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:03.839
Caption: basically just one app.js

03:02:00.879 --> 03:02:04.959
Caption: and inside app.js i have a fetch job

03:02:03.839 --> 03:02:08.240
Caption: component

03:02:04.959 --> 03:02:11.438
Caption: an inside fetch job i have got basically

03:02:08.240 --> 03:02:14.160
Caption: two functions i have got a um

03:02:11.439 --> 03:02:17.279
Caption: a rendered joke data which renders uh

03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:20.080
Caption: the beautiful ui that you saw earlier

03:02:17.279 --> 03:02:23.520
Caption: and i also have a if it&#39;s that populated

03:02:20.080 --> 03:02:25.919
Caption: data now this fetches the json object

03:02:23.519 --> 03:02:27.599
Caption: from the backend api

03:02:25.919 --> 03:02:28.319
Caption: or from the controller

03:02:27.599 --> 03:02:30.478
Caption: now

03:02:28.319 --> 03:02:33.439
Caption: what it does it renders a response in

03:02:30.478 --> 03:02:34.719
Caption: json and displays it for your viewing

03:02:33.439 --> 03:02:38.080
Caption: pleasure

03:02:34.719 --> 03:02:40.879
Caption: so that is the ui then into the back end

03:02:38.080 --> 03:02:43.520
Caption: is a net controller so what i&#39;m doing

03:02:40.879 --> 03:02:46.240
Caption: here i&#39;m implementing what is an ijoo

03:02:43.519 --> 03:02:47.278
Caption: client interface this is all in.net but

03:02:46.240 --> 03:02:51.520
Caption: don&#39;t worry you should be able to

03:02:47.279 --> 03:02:54.319
Caption: understand it and um what i do i call i

03:02:51.519 --> 03:02:56.000
Caption: instantiate htcp client i

03:02:54.319 --> 03:02:58.879
Caption: grab

03:02:56.000 --> 03:03:01.359
Caption: an endpoint and i call out to it and i

03:02:58.879 --> 03:03:03.279
Caption: serialize deserialize the json object

03:03:01.359 --> 03:03:04.160
Caption: and return it back to the fro the front

03:03:03.279 --> 03:03:06.319
Caption: end

03:03:04.160 --> 03:03:08.959
Caption: as a joke so what i&#39;m doing i&#39;m calling

03:03:06.319 --> 03:03:12.560
Caption: out to a third-party api from this from

03:03:08.959 --> 03:03:14.399
Caption: this uh controller

03:03:12.559 --> 03:03:16.719
Caption: the joke object itself that i&#39;m

03:03:14.399 --> 03:03:18.560
Caption: serializing deserializing is that setup

03:03:16.719 --> 03:03:22.559
Caption: punch line and source and it&#39;s got

03:03:18.559 --> 03:03:25.119
Caption: accessories and mutators as you&#39;d expect

03:03:22.559 --> 03:03:27.119
Caption: and then so then that&#39;s what you get so

03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:29.120
Caption: you get tell me another calls the third

03:03:27.120 --> 03:03:31.520
Caption: party joke api

03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:33.040
Caption: third party joke api returns and why are

03:03:31.519 --> 03:03:35.679
Caption: monkeys great at sports because they&#39;re

03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:37.839
Caption: born champions

03:03:35.679 --> 03:03:38.879
Caption: got a few drones

03:03:37.839 --> 03:03:41.599
Caption: um

03:03:38.879 --> 03:03:44.398
Caption: so that that that&#39;s our application

03:03:41.599 --> 03:03:46.959
Caption: now like any good thing we need a an

03:03:44.399 --> 03:03:50.240
Caption: architecture so the architecture is like

03:03:46.959 --> 03:03:52.559
Caption: this so we have a react web application

03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:54.799
Caption: i&#39;d love to move over the other edge of

03:03:52.559 --> 03:03:57.278
Caption: the day of the of the stage but i&#39;m free

03:03:54.799 --> 03:03:59.200
Caption: frightened my clicker won&#39;t work um

03:03:57.279 --> 03:04:00.720
Caption: react web application calls the.net

03:03:59.200 --> 03:04:01.520
Caption: microservice so the controller i showed

03:04:00.719 --> 03:04:04.160
Caption: you

03:04:01.519 --> 03:04:05.839
Caption: that then proxies into a third-party

03:04:04.160 --> 03:04:08.080
Caption: joke api

03:04:05.839 --> 03:04:10.799
Caption: uh which returns a joke to the

03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:12.639
Caption: controller uh and then back to the react

03:04:10.799 --> 03:04:15.040
Caption: web application

03:04:12.639 --> 03:04:17.839
Caption: but what happens if the third-party joke

03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:19.040
Caption: api that i do not control that is a

03:04:17.839 --> 03:04:24.080
Caption: third party

03:04:19.040 --> 03:04:25.839
Caption: ra has load runs into errors and fails

03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:28.479
Caption: well what happens then is the react

03:04:25.839 --> 03:04:30.639
Caption: client doesn&#39;t know that it&#39;s failed

03:04:28.478 --> 03:04:31.759
Caption: the net microservice still proxies the

03:04:30.639 --> 03:04:33.919
Caption: request

03:04:31.759 --> 03:04:37.120
Caption: to the third party joke api

03:04:33.919 --> 03:04:39.759
Caption: and it just waits uh it&#39;ll wait for

03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:42.160
Caption: because i&#39;m using the.net http client

03:04:39.759 --> 03:04:45.040
Caption: the default weight is 100 seconds so

03:04:42.160 --> 03:04:46.479
Caption: it&#39;ll wait for 100 seconds

03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:48.160
Caption: and that will mean the react web

03:04:46.478 --> 03:04:51.039
Caption: application will also be waiting for

03:04:48.160 --> 03:04:52.959
Caption: result from the dotted microservice

03:04:51.040 --> 03:04:54.879
Caption: and another client might come along and

03:04:52.959 --> 03:04:56.000
Caption: do a request for a new joke because we

03:04:54.879 --> 03:04:58.398
Caption: all need

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:59.839
Caption: bad jokes

03:04:58.399 --> 03:05:01.279
Caption: and it will proxy it through the

03:04:59.839 --> 03:05:03.839
Caption: third-party joke api which is still

03:05:01.279 --> 03:05:05.839
Caption: broken and again we&#39;ll get into this

03:05:03.839 --> 03:05:09.679
Caption: problem of waiting uh for the default

03:05:05.839 --> 03:05:12.160
Caption: timeout of uh the client request

03:05:09.679 --> 03:05:14.719
Caption: and what will happen after after time is

03:05:12.160 --> 03:05:16.879
Caption: that.net microservice will be just full

03:05:14.719 --> 03:05:18.879
Caption: of these waiting requests and it will

03:05:16.879 --> 03:05:21.120
Caption: start to fail and

03:05:18.879 --> 03:05:23.279
Caption: keep it&#39;ll keep cascading the failures

03:05:21.120 --> 03:05:26.319
Caption: back to the react web application which

03:05:23.279 --> 03:05:29.359
Caption: will just keep waiting um

03:05:26.319 --> 03:05:33.279
Caption: until yeah nothing so this is all very

03:05:29.359 --> 03:05:35.600
Caption: bad for our users and a very bad

03:05:33.279 --> 03:05:37.760
Caption: experience for them

03:05:35.599 --> 03:05:40.639
Caption: so let&#39;s go about fixing that and seeing

03:05:37.759 --> 03:05:43.200
Caption: how we can apply patterns to make it

03:05:40.639 --> 03:05:45.679
Caption: more resilient

03:05:43.200 --> 03:05:47.040
Caption: the first pattern i&#39;m going to define is

03:05:45.679 --> 03:05:48.239
Caption: timeouts so

03:05:47.040 --> 03:05:49.919
Caption: at the minute we&#39;re using default

03:05:48.240 --> 03:05:51.680
Caption: timeouts for everything which is 100

03:05:49.919 --> 03:05:54.639
Caption: seconds let&#39;s go about making the

03:05:51.679 --> 03:05:57.919
Caption: timeouts more determinate

03:05:54.639 --> 03:06:01.358
Caption: so here we are back in in the code

03:05:57.919 --> 03:06:04.000
Caption: so if we look at um the http client

03:06:01.359 --> 03:06:05.840
Caption: object uh in net we can actually add a

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:08.319
Caption: property to that directly now the

03:06:05.839 --> 03:06:10.000
Caption: property is called timeout imagine it&#39;s

03:06:08.319 --> 03:06:12.240
Caption: retitled i must say

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:13.839
Caption: and it is from seconds so i&#39;m going to

03:06:12.240 --> 03:06:15.919
Caption: give it five so that&#39;s going to override

03:06:13.839 --> 03:06:18.080
Caption: the default behavior of 100 seconds and

03:06:15.919 --> 03:06:19.919
Caption: at least make things more determinant

03:06:18.080 --> 03:06:20.719
Caption: so what&#39;s going to happen if i implement

03:06:19.919 --> 03:06:23.120
Caption: that

03:06:20.719 --> 03:06:24.959
Caption: is my my application is going to change

03:06:23.120 --> 03:06:29.639
Caption: its behavior somewhat

03:06:24.959 --> 03:06:29.639
Caption: so if i refresh the the client

03:06:30.719 --> 03:06:34.559
Caption: and you get another awesome joke if you

03:06:32.399 --> 03:06:36.000
Caption: hit tell me another it&#39;ll keep returning

03:06:34.559 --> 03:06:38.318
Caption: it will keep returning jokes as the

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:40.639
Caption: third party api is still up

03:06:38.319 --> 03:06:42.640
Caption: and so if i hit tell me another

03:06:40.639 --> 03:06:44.959
Caption: it&#39;ll keep returning until

03:06:42.639 --> 03:06:46.639
Caption: we get a failure in the third-party joke

03:06:44.959 --> 03:06:47.599
Caption: api

03:06:46.639 --> 03:06:49.839
Caption: which

03:06:47.599 --> 03:06:51.839
Caption: we probably will when this is spinning

03:06:49.839 --> 03:06:53.599
Caption: for more than five seconds so at the

03:06:51.839 --> 03:06:55.200
Caption: minute it&#39;s spinning so that means

03:06:53.599 --> 03:06:56.959
Caption: something is wrong

03:06:55.200 --> 03:06:59.680
Caption: so if we then go to the the back end

03:06:56.959 --> 03:07:02.240
Caption: controller and do the refresh you&#39;ll see

03:06:59.679 --> 03:07:04.959
Caption: boom we&#39;ve got a an unhandled exception

03:07:02.240 --> 03:07:07.600
Caption: uh which is actually if you look down a

03:07:04.959 --> 03:07:11.040
Caption: timeout exception so what&#39;s happened is

03:07:07.599 --> 03:07:15.679
Caption: the five seconds um has actually expired

03:07:11.040 --> 03:07:15.679
Caption: and it&#39;s bubbled up a timeout exception

03:07:15.839 --> 03:07:20.000
Caption: of five seconds so that that is a very

03:07:18.719 --> 03:07:23.759
Caption: rudimentary

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:26.399
Caption: um use of a timeout we&#39;re just making

03:07:23.759 --> 03:07:29.519
Caption: the request more determinate

03:07:26.399 --> 03:07:32.160
Caption: but that&#39;s that&#39;s only the start

03:07:29.519 --> 03:07:35.199
Caption: next the next phase of the refactoring

03:07:32.160 --> 03:07:37.200
Caption: of this application is by using a

03:07:35.200 --> 03:07:40.799
Caption: resilience library called poly has

03:07:37.200 --> 03:07:43.839
Caption: anybody used polyand.net

03:07:40.799 --> 03:07:45.278
Caption: excellent it is an excellent library um

03:07:43.839 --> 03:07:47.719
Caption: if you are not a

03:07:45.279 --> 03:07:50.000
Caption: developer don&#39;t worry um there are uh

03:07:47.719 --> 03:07:53.120
Caption: equivalent.net uh sorry equivalent

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:54.799
Caption: resilience libraries for java there&#39;s

03:07:53.120 --> 03:07:57.520
Caption: one inside spring

03:07:54.799 --> 03:07:59.759
Caption: if you&#39;re using the aws sdks all these

03:07:57.519 --> 03:08:01.759
Caption: patterns are actually built into them

03:07:59.759 --> 03:08:04.559
Caption: and there&#39;s also i&#39;ve seen a resilience

03:08:01.759 --> 03:08:07.759
Caption: library for typescript as well so poly

03:08:04.559 --> 03:08:07.759
Caption: is just the one for that

03:08:08.240 --> 03:08:12.399
Caption: so let&#39;s start using poly and really

03:08:10.160 --> 03:08:15.439
Caption: expand in our timeout

03:08:12.399 --> 03:08:17.279
Caption: let&#39;s get rid of that that was

03:08:15.439 --> 03:08:19.920
Caption: our default

03:08:17.279 --> 03:08:22.720
Caption: net http client timeout the first thing

03:08:19.919 --> 03:08:25.200
Caption: we need to do in poly is define a policy

03:08:22.719 --> 03:08:28.160
Caption: so what we do is define a policy that

03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:30.160
Caption: wraps our timeout so we say policy

03:08:28.160 --> 03:08:32.479
Caption: timeout async

03:08:30.160 --> 03:08:35.279
Caption: and then we need to give it a value

03:08:32.478 --> 03:08:37.278
Caption: which again we&#39;ll set this five seconds

03:08:35.279 --> 03:08:38.319
Caption: so the policy object comes from the poly

03:08:37.279 --> 03:08:40.879
Caption: library

03:08:38.319 --> 03:08:43.120
Caption: just for uh so you know and then once we

03:08:40.879 --> 03:08:46.240
Caption: have defined the policy we need to then

03:08:43.120 --> 03:08:48.479
Caption: put it in an execute so we&#39;re wrapping

03:08:46.240 --> 03:08:50.640
Caption: it async executor

03:08:48.478 --> 03:08:54.159
Caption: uh and then we&#39;ll pull once we&#39;ve

03:08:50.639 --> 03:08:56.318
Caption: defined the async method with

03:08:54.160 --> 03:08:56.319
Caption: a

03:08:57.439 --> 03:09:01.439
Caption: timeout token a token we will then wrap

03:09:00.240 --> 03:09:03.439
Caption: our entire

03:09:01.439 --> 03:09:06.240
Caption: call to the http client

03:09:03.439 --> 03:09:07.920
Caption: up push it in to our execute async

03:09:06.240 --> 03:09:08.879
Caption: anonymous inner function

03:09:07.919 --> 03:09:11.438
Caption: and

03:09:08.879 --> 03:09:11.438
Caption: define

03:09:11.519 --> 03:09:16.000
Caption: our cancellation token thank you

03:09:13.519 --> 03:09:18.000
Caption: so why why define the cancellation token

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:20.240
Caption: so the cancellation token is now giving

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:21.759
Caption: us greater granularity into the calls so

03:09:20.240 --> 03:09:25.279
Caption: we&#39;ve got two async calls in here we&#39;ve

03:09:21.759 --> 03:09:27.358
Caption: got a http client git async and a

03:09:25.279 --> 03:09:29.040
Caption: content.read async

03:09:27.359 --> 03:09:31.439
Caption: so the cancellation token will actually

03:09:29.040 --> 03:09:32.719
Caption: allow us to cancel whatever task is

03:09:31.439 --> 03:09:35.680
Caption: running

03:09:32.719 --> 03:09:37.919
Caption: so we then finish and make that a return

03:09:35.679 --> 03:09:39.679
Caption: to width and then we have five it and

03:09:37.919 --> 03:09:42.559
Caption: see what&#39;s going to happen now to our

03:09:39.679 --> 03:09:43.519
Caption: application again back in the front end

03:09:42.559 --> 03:09:46.159
Caption: we&#39;ll have

03:09:43.519 --> 03:09:48.318
Caption: a similar behavior where um the the ui

03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:50.319
Caption: will will keep refreshing for more than

03:09:48.319 --> 03:09:51.760
Caption: five seconds

03:09:50.319 --> 03:09:56.160
Caption: and then if we go into the the

03:09:51.759 --> 03:09:56.160
Caption: controller uh and we hit refresh

03:09:56.478 --> 03:10:00.159
Caption: we&#39;ll see different behavior so what&#39;s

03:09:57.839 --> 03:10:01.438
Caption: happening now the third party api has

03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:04.640
Caption: again failed

03:10:01.439 --> 03:10:06.240
Caption: uh but we&#39;ve got a cast a task uh

03:10:04.639 --> 03:10:08.719
Caption: cancelled exception because the

03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:12.399
Caption: cancellation token is invoked and that

03:10:08.719 --> 03:10:15.519
Caption: has meant that um the task is has um

03:10:12.399 --> 03:10:17.520
Caption: bubbled up that exception

03:10:15.519 --> 03:10:20.239
Caption: so as you can see we&#39;re on a bit of a

03:10:17.519 --> 03:10:21.919
Caption: journey here um so we&#39;ve got our timeout

03:10:20.240 --> 03:10:23.839
Caption: we&#39;ve then wrapped it in poly we&#39;ve got

03:10:21.919 --> 03:10:27.438
Caption: a greater granularity into the the call

03:10:23.839 --> 03:10:29.200
Caption: stack but um we&#39;re still getting um

03:10:27.439 --> 03:10:32.160
Caption: exceptions we&#39;re still bubbling up to

03:10:29.200 --> 03:10:35.600
Caption: the to the um the controller what&#39;s the

03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:37.600
Caption: next stage in refractoring this

03:10:35.599 --> 03:10:41.119
Caption: well the next stage the next pattern is

03:10:37.599 --> 03:10:44.398
Caption: called uh graceful degradation

03:10:41.120 --> 03:10:45.600
Caption: so like the name suggests

03:10:44.399 --> 03:10:48.560
Caption: it&#39;s gonna

03:10:45.599 --> 03:10:51.438
Caption: degrade gracefully i.e we&#39;re not going

03:10:48.559 --> 03:10:53.278
Caption: to uh we&#39;re going to have that client or

03:10:51.439 --> 03:10:55.600
Caption: our beautiful users who are using our

03:10:53.279 --> 03:10:58.479
Caption: beautiful joke um

03:10:55.599 --> 03:11:00.478
Caption: creation or joke rendering application

03:10:58.478 --> 03:11:01.358
Caption: actually get a result when things go

03:11:00.478 --> 03:11:04.478
Caption: wrong

03:11:01.359 --> 03:11:06.399
Caption: so that&#39;s the whole concept around

03:11:04.478 --> 03:11:08.879
Caption: graceful degradation the application

03:11:06.399 --> 03:11:12.959
Caption: gracefully degrades now how do we

03:11:08.879 --> 03:11:12.959
Caption: implement a graceful degradation

03:11:14.719 --> 03:11:17.839
Caption: so again we need to define what&#39;s called

03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:20.559
Caption: a

03:11:17.839 --> 03:11:23.120
Caption: fallback so a fallback is thing that you

03:11:20.559 --> 03:11:25.119
Caption: can present to your users when all thing

03:11:23.120 --> 03:11:28.240
Caption: all other things are filled

03:11:25.120 --> 03:11:30.240
Caption: so in poly i create a policy that

03:11:28.240 --> 03:11:32.479
Caption: returns a joke list

03:11:30.240 --> 03:11:35.200
Caption: uh innumerable and done as list

03:11:32.478 --> 03:11:37.759
Caption: and then on any exception

03:11:35.200 --> 03:11:40.240
Caption: it will do something

03:11:37.759 --> 03:11:42.478
Caption: so what we want our fallback to do

03:11:40.240 --> 03:11:45.759
Caption: is to return a joke

03:11:42.478 --> 03:11:46.879
Caption: so i&#39;m executing a fallback async that

03:11:45.759 --> 03:11:49.679
Caption: returns

03:11:46.879 --> 03:11:52.478
Caption: a a list of jokes but for this

03:11:49.679 --> 03:11:54.000
Caption: demonstration i&#39;m simply going to return

03:11:52.478 --> 03:11:55.599
Caption: one joke

03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:57.359
Caption: and i&#39;m going to do that inside another

03:11:55.599 --> 03:12:00.318
Caption: async anonymous function that has a

03:11:57.359 --> 03:12:02.240
Caption: cancellation token just like um

03:12:00.319 --> 03:12:05.520
Caption: we had in our

03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:07.439
Caption: initial request so define it as a new

03:12:05.519 --> 03:12:10.000
Caption: list

03:12:07.439 --> 03:12:13.359
Caption: once i&#39;ve defined it as a new list

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:15.919
Caption: i then need to define my joke

03:12:13.359 --> 03:12:18.959
Caption: so the joke object if you remember has

03:12:15.919 --> 03:12:20.240
Caption: uh basically three fields it has a

03:12:18.959 --> 03:12:22.799
Caption: source

03:12:20.240 --> 03:12:24.879
Caption: a setup first

03:12:22.799 --> 03:12:26.398
Caption: it has a punch line the all-important

03:12:24.879 --> 03:12:30.839
Caption: punchline

03:12:26.399 --> 03:12:30.840
Caption: and it has a source

03:12:32.879 --> 03:12:36.559
Caption: so once i&#39;ve defined that source i&#39;m

03:12:35.040 --> 03:12:38.319
Caption: going to give it a name of fallback so

03:12:36.559 --> 03:12:40.318
Caption: you know that when this renders you&#39;ll

03:12:38.319 --> 03:12:43.120
Caption: see source equals fallback

03:12:40.319 --> 03:12:46.640
Caption: on the ui so we can see that our

03:12:43.120 --> 03:12:48.639
Caption: fallback has been returned

03:12:46.639 --> 03:12:50.559
Caption: now we&#39;re going to um what&#39;s called

03:12:48.639 --> 03:12:52.879
Caption: implement what&#39;s called a policy wrapper

03:12:50.559 --> 03:12:56.799
Caption: this is this is where we can actually um

03:12:52.879 --> 03:12:58.959
Caption: chain policies together um using poly

03:12:56.799 --> 03:13:01.438
Caption: so the general fallback policy that i&#39;ve

03:12:58.959 --> 03:13:03.839
Caption: defined i&#39;m wrapping the original policy

03:13:01.439 --> 03:13:06.160
Caption: in which is our timeout if you remember

03:13:03.839 --> 03:13:08.318
Caption: so now

03:13:06.160 --> 03:13:12.560
Caption: i&#39;m going to change

03:13:08.319 --> 03:13:12.560
Caption: and execute the policy wrap

03:13:13.679 --> 03:13:17.919
Caption: okay so what what&#39;s going to happen now

03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:19.439
Caption: is we&#39;re going to return this joke if a

03:13:17.919 --> 03:13:22.120
Caption: five second

03:13:19.439 --> 03:13:23.840
Caption: uh timeout occurs i&#39;m in a band called

03:13:22.120 --> 03:13:26.839
Caption: 1023

03:13:23.839 --> 03:13:29.679
Caption: megabits or megabytes

03:13:26.839 --> 03:13:33.200
Caption: sorry we haven&#39;t

03:13:29.679 --> 03:13:35.040
Caption: had any gigs yet

03:13:33.200 --> 03:13:37.359
Caption: kabum tish

03:13:35.040 --> 03:13:38.860
Caption: thank you thank you

03:13:37.359 --> 03:13:41.040
Caption: claps are good thank you

03:13:38.860 --> 03:13:43.520
Caption: [Laughter]

03:13:41.040 --> 03:13:46.080
Caption: so um so that&#39;s our fallback

03:13:43.519 --> 03:13:47.919
Caption: now if we go back into our our ui let&#39;s

03:13:46.080 --> 03:13:49.919
Caption: have a look and see what happens

03:13:47.919 --> 03:13:54.120
Caption: so let&#39;s refresh it&#39;s wait for f5 to

03:13:49.919 --> 03:13:54.120
Caption: work in the application to come up

03:13:56.000 --> 03:14:01.679
Caption: so here we go um so ui controller

03:13:58.879 --> 03:14:01.679
Caption: third-party api

03:14:02.080 --> 03:14:06.719
Caption: so we&#39;ve went straight to the fallback

03:14:03.839 --> 03:14:07.599
Caption: you see source equals fallback

03:14:06.719 --> 03:14:09.278
Caption: um

03:14:07.599 --> 03:14:13.358
Caption: you can see that we&#39;ve hit the fallback

03:14:09.279 --> 03:14:13.359
Caption: right away if i go tell me another

03:14:13.599 --> 03:14:18.159
Caption: there we are the third party joke api is

03:14:15.759 --> 03:14:21.200
Caption: recovered uh i tell you to be joked but

03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:22.560
Caption: you might not get it nice

03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:26.560
Caption: there&#39;s even networking jokes in here

03:14:22.559 --> 03:14:28.879
Caption: come on refresh again and you&#39;ve got i&#39;m

03:14:26.559 --> 03:14:31.519
Caption: in a band called 1024 so a fallback

03:14:28.879 --> 03:14:34.000
Caption: again has has been invoked then refresh

03:14:31.519 --> 03:14:36.799
Caption: that and why don&#39;t werewolves

03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:39.679
Caption: ever know the time because they&#39;re not

03:14:36.799 --> 03:14:40.959
Caption: when wolves third-party joke api sorry

03:14:39.679 --> 03:14:44.799
Caption: that you can&#39;t read that that was that

03:14:40.959 --> 03:14:47.519
Caption: was bad um so that is our fallback we

03:14:44.799 --> 03:14:49.200
Caption: are invoking it when the timeout of five

03:14:47.519 --> 03:14:51.759
Caption: seconds happens

03:14:49.200 --> 03:14:53.600
Caption: and returns a joke you can return a list

03:14:51.759 --> 03:14:54.559
Caption: or a random entry in that list if you

03:14:53.599 --> 03:14:56.879
Caption: wanted to

03:14:54.559 --> 03:14:59.839
Caption: but for brevity i&#39;m returning one joke

03:14:56.879 --> 03:15:01.358
Caption: only with the source of fallback

03:14:59.839 --> 03:15:06.358
Caption: and that&#39;s how you

03:15:01.359 --> 03:15:06.359
Caption: do gracefully degrade our api

03:15:06.399 --> 03:15:08.640
Caption: cool

03:15:08.799 --> 03:15:14.318
Caption: so that&#39;s that&#39;s great you say um

03:15:11.359 --> 03:15:17.120
Caption: the third party joke api fails

03:15:14.319 --> 03:15:20.399
Caption: times out after five five seconds users

03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:24.319
Caption: always get a joke that we can determine

03:15:20.399 --> 03:15:27.359
Caption: um well not really um because we need to

03:15:24.319 --> 03:15:28.239
Caption: to give the third party joke api more

03:15:27.359 --> 03:15:30.319
Caption: time

03:15:28.239 --> 03:15:32.959
Caption: to if it&#39;s under load

03:15:30.319 --> 03:15:35.600
Caption: to recover and we need to be able to not

03:15:32.959 --> 03:15:37.438
Caption: just try once to get that joke from our

03:15:35.599 --> 03:15:39.759
Caption: controller to the third party api we

03:15:37.439 --> 03:15:43.760
Caption: need to try it a few times and that&#39;s

03:15:39.759 --> 03:15:46.719
Caption: where what a retry will retry is

03:15:43.759 --> 03:15:49.839
Caption: so let&#39;s push a retry pattern into into

03:15:46.719 --> 03:15:49.839
Caption: our application

03:15:50.319 --> 03:15:53.680
Caption: so again

03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:56.000
Caption: we&#39;ll just gonna refactor the general

03:15:53.679 --> 03:15:58.000
Caption: fallback into a method

03:15:56.000 --> 03:15:59.359
Caption: called general fallback because i&#39;m very

03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:00.610
Caption: imaginative

03:15:59.359 --> 03:16:01.840
Caption: and then once you

03:16:00.610 --> 03:16:03.200
Caption: [Music]

03:16:01.839 --> 03:16:05.358
Caption: then the next thing we&#39;re going to do is

03:16:03.200 --> 03:16:07.279
Caption: define that retry policy

03:16:05.359 --> 03:16:10.880
Caption: so the retry policy

03:16:07.279 --> 03:16:10.879
Caption: is it&#39;s fairly straightforward

03:16:11.679 --> 03:16:15.599
Caption: again type policy

03:16:13.839 --> 03:16:17.358
Caption: on the handle

03:16:15.599 --> 03:16:18.879
Caption: of exception now you could be more

03:16:17.359 --> 03:16:21.200
Caption: generic i&#39;m very generic in this

03:16:18.879 --> 03:16:23.919
Caption: exception again for brevity but you can

03:16:21.200 --> 03:16:26.640
Caption: be quite specific if you want

03:16:23.919 --> 03:16:29.438
Caption: um and then once the exception happens i

03:16:26.639 --> 03:16:32.799
Caption: want to retry async a number of times so

03:16:29.439 --> 03:16:35.279
Caption: this time i&#39;m going to retry five times

03:16:32.799 --> 03:16:38.080
Caption: i&#39;m going to build that retry policy

03:16:35.279 --> 03:16:40.800
Caption: into my policy wrapper so

03:16:38.080 --> 03:16:42.799
Caption: the first policy i want to do

03:16:40.799 --> 03:16:46.959
Caption: is the retry policy

03:16:42.799 --> 03:16:48.239
Caption: so i want to do the initial request

03:16:46.959 --> 03:16:50.319
Caption: if that

03:16:48.239 --> 03:16:52.959
Caption: hits the exception i&#39;m going to retry

03:16:50.319 --> 03:16:55.120
Caption: five times if that hits the exception

03:16:52.959 --> 03:16:57.279
Caption: five times um

03:16:55.120 --> 03:16:59.520
Caption: then i&#39;ll handle my fallback i&#39;m going

03:16:57.279 --> 03:17:01.600
Caption: to change the timeout to two seconds

03:16:59.519 --> 03:17:03.438
Caption: because you know five times five is a

03:17:01.599 --> 03:17:06.080
Caption: long time so five times two is a bit

03:17:03.439 --> 03:17:07.439
Caption: quicker so f5 that

03:17:06.080 --> 03:17:09.919
Caption: and let&#39;s see what happens to your

03:17:07.439 --> 03:17:09.920
Caption: application

03:17:11.519 --> 03:17:14.318
Caption: front end first

03:17:15.759 --> 03:17:18.639
Caption: loading loading

03:17:19.679 --> 03:17:22.478
Caption: so third-party api there are two hard

03:17:21.359 --> 03:17:26.160
Caption: things computer science we&#39;ve had that

03:17:22.478 --> 03:17:28.478
Caption: before come on duke api

03:17:26.160 --> 03:17:31.279
Caption: tell me another refreshing

03:17:28.478 --> 03:17:32.799
Caption: so we&#39;ll know that if it&#39;s go over two

03:17:31.279 --> 03:17:34.640
Caption: seconds so our timeline is set to two

03:17:32.799 --> 03:17:36.799
Caption: seconds so if this is loading more than

03:17:34.639 --> 03:17:38.879
Caption: two seconds we know we&#39;re retrying and

03:17:36.799 --> 03:17:40.559
Caption: now it&#39;s retried five times

03:17:38.879 --> 03:17:41.679
Caption: hasn&#39;t worked so we&#39;re back to our

03:17:40.559 --> 03:17:43.278
Caption: fallback

03:17:41.679 --> 03:17:45.278
Caption: because we&#39;ve always got our fallback

03:17:43.279 --> 03:17:47.120
Caption: and then tell me another 10 times people

03:17:45.279 --> 03:17:48.479
Caption: in the world those who understand binary

03:17:47.120 --> 03:17:51.040
Caption: and those don&#39;t

03:17:48.478 --> 03:17:52.159
Caption: um and then refresh again on our back

03:17:51.040 --> 03:17:54.000
Caption: end

03:17:52.160 --> 03:17:57.120
Caption: let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening there from

03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:57.120
Caption: our controller&#39;s perspective

03:17:57.200 --> 03:18:01.200
Caption: so it&#39;s taking more than two seconds so

03:17:58.959 --> 03:18:02.478
Caption: we&#39;re retrying

03:18:01.200 --> 03:18:04.000
Caption: and then

03:18:02.478 --> 03:18:07.199
Caption: well actually a third-party api has come

03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:08.799
Caption: back again inside the five retry window

03:18:07.200 --> 03:18:11.040
Caption: so we&#39;re getting a real joke

03:18:08.799 --> 03:18:12.559
Caption: if i retry that again

03:18:11.040 --> 03:18:14.479
Caption: it&#39;s pretty happy at the minute why did

03:18:12.559 --> 03:18:17.759
Caption: billable bygones always it is lunch at

03:18:14.478 --> 03:18:19.679
Caption: noon he was a creature of hobbit

03:18:17.759 --> 03:18:23.839
Caption: no

03:18:19.679 --> 03:18:26.160
Caption: come on very topical um

03:18:23.839 --> 03:18:28.559
Caption: and this third-party joke api as always

03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:31.359
Caption: is very happy

03:18:28.559 --> 03:18:31.358
Caption: refresh again

03:18:33.279 --> 03:18:40.399
Caption: oh here we go so we&#39;re retrying

03:18:37.839 --> 03:18:42.478
Caption: can we hit five yes there we go so uh

03:18:40.399 --> 03:18:44.720
Caption: we&#39;re back to our fallback because we&#39;ve

03:18:42.478 --> 03:18:48.398
Caption: retried five times two second increments

03:18:44.719 --> 03:18:50.559
Caption: and it&#39;s fell back to our fallback

03:18:48.399 --> 03:18:52.959
Caption: and we&#39;ll just go over the code so two

03:18:50.559 --> 03:18:55.278
Caption: second timeout

03:18:52.959 --> 03:18:57.599
Caption: if the exception occurs

03:18:55.279 --> 03:18:59.200
Caption: over a retry count of five

03:18:57.599 --> 03:19:03.639
Caption: then we will hit

03:18:59.200 --> 03:19:03.640
Caption: our fallback exception

03:19:04.080 --> 03:19:06.959
Caption: three tries

03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:09.279
Caption: so

03:19:06.959 --> 03:19:10.879
Caption: that&#39;s three tries and retries are

03:19:09.279 --> 03:19:12.399
Caption: really really really nice

03:19:10.879 --> 03:19:14.000
Caption: but what happens

03:19:12.399 --> 03:19:16.399
Caption: when you just

03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:19.439
Caption: implement retries

03:19:16.399 --> 03:19:21.520
Caption: so just say i had this controller uh

03:19:19.439 --> 03:19:23.600
Caption: just implementing the retry pattern

03:19:21.519 --> 03:19:25.039
Caption: um and i had many of these controllers

03:19:23.599 --> 03:19:26.719
Caption: all hitting my

03:19:25.040 --> 03:19:28.799
Caption: third party api

03:19:26.719 --> 03:19:30.719
Caption: at two second intervals

03:19:28.799 --> 03:19:33.040
Caption: well what i&#39;ve just created is a

03:19:30.719 --> 03:19:35.278
Caption: distributed denali service application

03:19:33.040 --> 03:19:37.599
Caption: that&#39;s hitting that third-party api and

03:19:35.279 --> 03:19:39.919
Caption: uh probably putting it under more load

03:19:37.599 --> 03:19:42.959
Caption: than it can probably handle because

03:19:39.919 --> 03:19:46.160
Caption: everybody in the world wants bad jokes

03:19:42.959 --> 03:19:48.959
Caption: so what we need to do is improve that

03:19:46.160 --> 03:19:50.640
Caption: retry pattern and implement an

03:19:48.959 --> 03:19:51.919
Caption: exponential back off

03:19:50.639 --> 03:19:53.438
Caption: i think i&#39;ve got some i got a slide

03:19:51.919 --> 03:19:56.398
Caption: about this as well

03:19:53.439 --> 03:19:59.600
Caption: so what&#39;s the exponential back off it&#39;s

03:19:56.399 --> 03:20:02.319
Caption: simply backing off between retries

03:19:59.599 --> 03:20:04.238
Caption: so as always our react web application

03:20:02.319 --> 03:20:05.600
Caption: goes through and proxies through our.net

03:20:04.239 --> 03:20:07.839
Caption: microservice

03:20:05.599 --> 03:20:11.679
Caption: and then may uh

03:20:07.839 --> 03:20:13.279
Caption: if it&#39;s will timeout after two seconds

03:20:11.679 --> 03:20:15.839
Caption: after that two seconds it will then

03:20:13.279 --> 03:20:18.000
Caption: retry

03:20:15.839 --> 03:20:20.398
Caption: but with an extra exponential back off

03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:22.799
Caption: instead of retrying after two seconds

03:20:20.399 --> 03:20:24.959
Caption: again you actually wait for four seconds

03:20:22.799 --> 03:20:26.959
Caption: for the next retry

03:20:24.959 --> 03:20:30.160
Caption: and then eight seconds because the

03:20:26.959 --> 03:20:32.959
Caption: timeout the time between retries is

03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:34.640
Caption: increasing exponentially hence the name

03:20:32.959 --> 03:20:36.399
Caption: and then finally

03:20:34.639 --> 03:20:38.318
Caption: we&#39;ll have wait for 16 seconds and

03:20:36.399 --> 03:20:42.399
Caption: hopefully after 16 seconds our third

03:20:38.319 --> 03:20:46.399
Caption: party joke api will recover and return a

03:20:42.399 --> 03:20:48.959
Caption: result to our react web application

03:20:46.399 --> 03:20:50.560
Caption: so let&#39;s implement a exponential back

03:20:48.959 --> 03:20:53.359
Caption: off

03:20:50.559 --> 03:20:53.358
Caption: in our code

03:20:54.160 --> 03:20:56.959
Caption: so

03:20:54.959 --> 03:20:59.359
Caption: the only it&#39;s pretty simple thing to do

03:20:56.959 --> 03:21:04.000
Caption: um so what we need to do is add a little

03:20:59.359 --> 03:21:04.000
Caption: bit of maths to our repa retry logic

03:21:04.799 --> 03:21:09.040
Caption: so luckily in poly there&#39;s a wait and

03:21:06.639 --> 03:21:11.438
Caption: retry async method that i&#39;m going to use

03:21:09.040 --> 03:21:13.839
Caption: i&#39;m going to

03:21:11.439 --> 03:21:17.680
Caption: give it a duration of three

03:21:13.839 --> 03:21:17.679
Caption: and a retry attempt number

03:21:19.599 --> 03:21:22.398
Caption: and

03:21:20.639 --> 03:21:24.318
Caption: i&#39;m going to

03:21:22.399 --> 03:21:26.160
Caption: time span between retail attempts is

03:21:24.319 --> 03:21:27.120
Caption: this is where we want to exponentially

03:21:26.160 --> 03:21:29.520
Caption: increase

03:21:27.120 --> 03:21:30.560
Caption: so i used math.pow

03:21:29.519 --> 03:21:32.318
Caption: i put in

03:21:30.559 --> 03:21:33.119
Caption: two because we want to do the power of

03:21:32.319 --> 03:21:35.200
Caption: two

03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:37.359
Caption: by by the number of retry attempts that

03:21:35.200 --> 03:21:39.120
Caption: we we have so it&#39;s two

03:21:37.359 --> 03:21:42.080
Caption: 8 16.

03:21:39.120 --> 03:21:44.080
Caption: well i&#39;ll render as

03:21:42.080 --> 03:21:46.080
Caption: so that&#39;s uh that&#39;s me exponentially

03:21:44.080 --> 03:21:48.160
Caption: adding let&#39;s be adding exponential back

03:21:46.080 --> 03:21:50.719
Caption: off to the code

03:21:48.160 --> 03:21:52.799
Caption: pretty simple so when i do f5 and run

03:21:50.719 --> 03:21:55.278
Caption: the application

03:21:52.799 --> 03:21:57.599
Caption: we&#39;ll then have again a different

03:21:55.279 --> 03:22:00.160
Caption: behavior because what we&#39;re doing now is

03:21:57.599 --> 03:22:04.000
Caption: we&#39;re giving that third party api time

03:22:00.160 --> 03:22:04.000
Caption: to actually get working again

03:22:04.719 --> 03:22:08.478
Caption: so here&#39;s our um

03:22:06.879 --> 03:22:09.519
Caption: what do you call developer from finland

03:22:08.478 --> 03:22:12.959
Caption: nerdic

03:22:09.519 --> 03:22:12.959
Caption: that&#39;s a new one tell me another

03:22:15.679 --> 03:22:18.398
Caption: so

03:22:16.478 --> 03:22:20.719
Caption: as it&#39;s over two seconds i can tell now

03:22:18.399 --> 03:22:23.359
Caption: that we&#39;re retrying so in this case we

03:22:20.719 --> 03:22:26.160
Caption: want it to go two four you hit 16. so if

03:22:23.359 --> 03:22:27.600
Caption: this spins for 16 seconds which i could

03:22:26.160 --> 03:22:29.200
Caption: tell you when you&#39;re standing up here is

03:22:27.599 --> 03:22:31.438
Caption: a very long time

03:22:29.200 --> 03:22:32.719
Caption: um then we&#39;re going we should get our

03:22:31.439 --> 03:22:35.200
Caption: fallback

03:22:32.719 --> 03:22:38.318
Caption: and there we go yes right on cue uh i&#39;m

03:22:35.200 --> 03:22:40.000
Caption: a band uh tell me another and there we

03:22:38.319 --> 03:22:42.319
Caption: go what&#39;s what&#39;s happened is our third

03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:44.559
Caption: party api has come back and we&#39;re now

03:22:42.319 --> 03:22:46.560
Caption: getting jokes again because we give it

03:22:44.559 --> 03:22:48.559
Caption: time uh we haven&#39;t hit it every two

03:22:46.559 --> 03:22:50.079
Caption: seconds we&#39;ve actually

03:22:48.559 --> 03:22:52.959
Caption: hit it two four

03:22:50.080 --> 03:22:54.719
Caption: eight sixteen now i&#39;ve chose two seconds

03:22:52.959 --> 03:22:56.799
Caption: because it&#39;s arbitrary you can choose

03:22:54.719 --> 03:22:59.040
Caption: the number uh that actually fits your

03:22:56.799 --> 03:23:00.559
Caption: use case uh in your

03:22:59.040 --> 03:23:01.759
Caption: what user behavior you want to see in

03:23:00.559 --> 03:23:03.679
Caption: your application

03:23:01.759 --> 03:23:05.759
Caption: but for this little um demonstration

03:23:03.679 --> 03:23:07.519
Caption: i&#39;ve chose two seconds because you

03:23:05.759 --> 03:23:09.438
Caption: really don&#39;t want to sit there and watch

03:23:07.519 --> 03:23:11.759
Caption: that spinning wheel for for a minute or

03:23:09.439 --> 03:23:11.760
Caption: whatever

03:23:12.080 --> 03:23:17.279
Caption: but there&#39;s more

03:23:14.239 --> 03:23:18.959
Caption: so that that&#39;s exponential back off but

03:23:17.279 --> 03:23:21.600
Caption: exponential back off is not enough

03:23:18.959 --> 03:23:23.200
Caption: because it&#39;s a very popular pattern

03:23:21.599 --> 03:23:26.238
Caption: everybody if they&#39;re implementing

03:23:23.200 --> 03:23:27.200
Caption: retries is also doing exponential back

03:23:26.239 --> 03:23:29.120
Caption: off

03:23:27.200 --> 03:23:31.120
Caption: with three tries now

03:23:29.120 --> 03:23:34.479
Caption: what happens is

03:23:31.120 --> 03:23:37.479
Caption: yes we have a broader distrib

03:23:34.478 --> 03:23:37.478
Caption: distribution

03:23:37.679 --> 03:23:41.438
Caption: of retries uh but what happens is

03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:44.478
Caption: everybody does it

03:23:41.439 --> 03:23:46.800
Caption: exponentially and so our retries

03:23:44.478 --> 03:23:48.398
Caption: actually end up clustering anyway

03:23:46.799 --> 03:23:49.759
Caption: so

03:23:48.399 --> 03:23:51.200
Caption: the whole problem that we&#39;re trying to

03:23:49.759 --> 03:23:52.719
Caption: fix ie

03:23:51.200 --> 03:23:54.959
Caption: hitting that&#39;s

03:23:52.719 --> 03:23:57.679
Caption: trying to give that server our api

03:23:54.959 --> 03:24:00.000
Caption: third-party api chance to recover we&#39;re

03:23:57.679 --> 03:24:01.358
Caption: actually um we&#39;re not we&#39;re not doing it

03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:03.359
Caption: because we&#39;re still hitting it all at

03:24:01.359 --> 03:24:04.720
Caption: once as you can see in the left-hand

03:24:03.359 --> 03:24:08.080
Caption: diagram those requests are all

03:24:04.719 --> 03:24:09.438
Caption: clustering um as they come in

03:24:08.080 --> 03:24:11.520
Caption: so what we want to do is actually

03:24:09.439 --> 03:24:13.200
Caption: flatten flatten make those requests

03:24:11.519 --> 03:24:15.679
Caption: actually random

03:24:13.200 --> 03:24:16.479
Caption: we don&#39;t um want

03:24:15.679 --> 03:24:18.719
Caption: to

03:24:16.478 --> 03:24:21.119
Caption: get spikes of requests all coming at

03:24:18.719 --> 03:24:22.959
Caption: once to our third-party api because it&#39;s

03:24:21.120 --> 03:24:24.479
Caption: going to crash again we need it to

03:24:22.959 --> 03:24:27.519
Caption: recover

03:24:24.478 --> 03:24:29.599
Caption: so what we do is we add jitter

03:24:27.519 --> 03:24:30.879
Caption: now there&#39;s a link there in the slide so

03:24:29.599 --> 03:24:33.199
Caption: we have um

03:24:30.879 --> 03:24:36.959
Caption: what&#39;s called a builder&#39;s library

03:24:33.200 --> 03:24:38.399
Caption: in amazon aws amazon.com gives you a

03:24:36.959 --> 03:24:40.239
Caption: list of all these patterns and how to

03:24:38.399 --> 03:24:41.359
Caption: implement them

03:24:40.239 --> 03:24:43.120
Caption: jitter is just one of the patterns

03:24:41.359 --> 03:24:44.160
Caption: there&#39;s a whole lot of different

03:24:43.120 --> 03:24:47.679
Caption: patterns that you need when you&#39;re

03:24:44.160 --> 03:24:47.679
Caption: building cloud native applications

03:24:48.080 --> 03:24:52.239
Caption: so let&#39;s see how we&#39;d implement

03:24:50.239 --> 03:24:55.239
Caption: exponential backup with jitter in our

03:24:52.239 --> 03:24:55.239
Caption: application

03:24:56.080 --> 03:25:00.639
Caption: so what we need to do is define a bit of

03:24:58.239 --> 03:25:03.279
Caption: randomness to this retry

03:25:00.639 --> 03:25:05.278
Caption: and so luckily in.net there is a

03:25:03.279 --> 03:25:06.879
Caption: math.random

03:25:05.279 --> 03:25:08.640
Caption: which we can define

03:25:06.879 --> 03:25:10.160
Caption: inside of time span so what i&#39;m doing

03:25:08.639 --> 03:25:12.799
Caption: here i define a time span of

03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:15.359
Caption: milliseconds and inside i&#39;m going to

03:25:12.799 --> 03:25:18.478
Caption: define that as a new random number so

03:25:15.359 --> 03:25:21.359
Caption: i&#39;m adding a random amount of time

03:25:18.478 --> 03:25:24.959
Caption: between each retry

03:25:21.359 --> 03:25:27.439
Caption: so that if in effect flattens the um the

03:25:24.959 --> 03:25:29.120
Caption: retry curve

03:25:27.439 --> 03:25:30.880
Caption: and that&#39;s it that&#39;s all you have to do

03:25:29.120 --> 03:25:33.439
Caption: to implement jitter

03:25:30.879 --> 03:25:35.200
Caption: in a retry so it&#39;s you should you should

03:25:33.439 --> 03:25:37.439
Caption: do it basically

03:25:35.200 --> 03:25:39.200
Caption: so let&#39;s um exponential back off with

03:25:37.439 --> 03:25:41.200
Caption: jitter

03:25:39.200 --> 03:25:44.479
Caption: now we&#39;re going to get into

03:25:41.200 --> 03:25:48.239
Caption: um the fun one circuit breaker

03:25:44.478 --> 03:25:49.919
Caption: so what is a circuit breaker so

03:25:48.239 --> 03:25:51.279
Caption: if you have a we have a react web

03:25:49.919 --> 03:25:53.438
Caption: application

03:25:51.279 --> 03:25:56.160
Caption: proxying third-party joke api it&#39;s

03:25:53.439 --> 03:25:58.239
Caption: breaking randomly

03:25:56.160 --> 03:25:59.919
Caption: and we keep retrying and we&#39;re using

03:25:58.239 --> 03:26:02.000
Caption: exponential back off with jitter we

03:25:59.919 --> 03:26:03.279
Caption: trying we trying hopefully it&#39;ll come

03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:06.080
Caption: back

03:26:03.279 --> 03:26:08.800
Caption: but what if we wanted to reduce the load

03:26:06.080 --> 03:26:10.639
Caption: completely off the third-party joke api

03:26:08.799 --> 03:26:12.239
Caption: for a period of time you know at the

03:26:10.639 --> 03:26:14.238
Caption: minute we&#39;re just implementing retries

03:26:12.239 --> 03:26:16.080
Caption: with jitter and exponential back off but

03:26:14.239 --> 03:26:18.399
Caption: ultimately it&#39;s hitting it&#39;s hitting

03:26:16.080 --> 03:26:19.679
Caption: that third party 2 kpr

03:26:18.399 --> 03:26:21.600
Caption: well this is where a circuit breaker

03:26:19.679 --> 03:26:23.278
Caption: comes in so a circuit breaker is

03:26:21.599 --> 03:26:25.119
Caption: something that you can implement that

03:26:23.279 --> 03:26:26.479
Caption: will actually stop

03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:30.000
Caption: requests

03:26:26.478 --> 03:26:33.119
Caption: going through to the third party api or

03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:34.719
Caption: other service that that you choose for a

03:26:33.120 --> 03:26:35.919
Caption: number of minutes

03:26:34.719 --> 03:26:38.719
Caption: why would you implement the circuit

03:26:35.919 --> 03:26:41.359
Caption: breaker because it&#39;s giving ultimately

03:26:38.719 --> 03:26:43.759
Caption: this third-party api no request so it

03:26:41.359 --> 03:26:45.919
Caption: can spin up it can fix itself and

03:26:43.759 --> 03:26:48.080
Caption: hopefully come back so with the circuit

03:26:45.919 --> 03:26:49.438
Caption: breaker the request when it comes back

03:26:48.080 --> 03:26:51.759
Caption: it comes back from the circuit breaker

03:26:49.439 --> 03:26:53.680
Caption: itself and returns to the react web

03:26:51.759 --> 03:26:56.318
Caption: application

03:26:53.679 --> 03:26:58.398
Caption: so now any other subsequent request in

03:26:56.319 --> 03:27:01.840
Caption: that time span of the circuit breaker

03:26:58.399 --> 03:27:03.200
Caption: will be quick responsive and the um the

03:27:01.839 --> 03:27:05.919
Caption: users will be happy they won&#39;t be

03:27:03.200 --> 03:27:08.080
Caption: waiting for a time a retry or an

03:27:05.919 --> 03:27:10.398
Caption: exponential retry or anything like that

03:27:08.080 --> 03:27:11.439
Caption: they will get a more responsive um

03:27:10.399 --> 03:27:13.760
Caption: response

03:27:11.439 --> 03:27:16.479
Caption: for their request

03:27:13.759 --> 03:27:18.478
Caption: so let&#39;s implement a circuit breaker

03:27:16.478 --> 03:27:21.599
Caption: with a circuit breaker you need some

03:27:18.478 --> 03:27:23.278
Caption: states so you have to store state inside

03:27:21.599 --> 03:27:25.358
Caption: the you where you&#39;re calling it or where

03:27:23.279 --> 03:27:27.439
Caption: you&#39;re implementing it so i&#39;m just going

03:27:25.359 --> 03:27:29.439
Caption: to refactor this a little bit and

03:27:27.439 --> 03:27:30.560
Caption: refactor what we&#39;ve got into

03:27:29.439 --> 03:27:32.479
Caption: a global

03:27:30.559 --> 03:27:33.599
Caption: field so policy wrap will become a

03:27:32.478 --> 03:27:35.438
Caption: global

03:27:33.599 --> 03:27:38.000
Caption: inside the controller and then i&#39;m just

03:27:35.439 --> 03:27:40.000
Caption: going to pull what i&#39;ve got already and

03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:42.399
Caption: refactor that into a method because

03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:46.080
Caption: that&#39;s not going to change what we need

03:27:42.399 --> 03:27:47.520
Caption: to do is add to it so extract the method

03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:50.319
Caption: and call it

03:27:47.519 --> 03:27:50.318
Caption: init policies

03:27:51.439 --> 03:27:55.520
Caption: so there we go so what we&#39;ve basically

03:27:53.359 --> 03:27:58.000
Caption: got is the init policy is called

03:27:55.519 --> 03:28:00.159
Caption: and then we we call the the api with the

03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:02.160
Caption: right policies

03:28:00.160 --> 03:28:04.799
Caption: so inside init policies itself let&#39;s

03:28:02.160 --> 03:28:06.560
Caption: just jump into it after i&#39;ve tidied it

03:28:04.799 --> 03:28:09.278
Caption: up

03:28:06.559 --> 03:28:12.639
Caption: so nothing&#39;s changed we&#39;ve got our retry

03:28:09.279 --> 03:28:16.080
Caption: general fallback and his initial policy

03:28:12.639 --> 03:28:19.199
Caption: now we need to define

03:28:16.080 --> 03:28:22.000
Caption: what is our circuit breaker

03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:23.600
Caption: now a circuit breaker itself is is a

03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:26.160
Caption: policy

03:28:23.599 --> 03:28:28.478
Caption: you define it as a policy just like the

03:28:26.160 --> 03:28:28.479
Caption: rest

03:28:31.519 --> 03:28:35.199
Caption: now

03:28:32.799 --> 03:28:38.599
Caption: again i&#39;m catching a very high level

03:28:35.200 --> 03:28:38.600
Caption: generic exception

03:28:41.759 --> 03:28:45.358
Caption: but in poly we have actually got a

03:28:43.759 --> 03:28:47.759
Caption: circuit breaker

03:28:45.359 --> 03:28:47.760
Caption: async

03:28:50.839 --> 03:28:54.478
Caption: method what we&#39;re doing we&#39;re saying

03:28:53.120 --> 03:28:56.319
Caption: circuit breaker

03:28:54.478 --> 03:28:59.839
Caption: if um

03:28:56.319 --> 03:29:01.600
Caption: you stay active for a time span uh uh

03:28:59.839 --> 03:29:03.519
Caption: after a number of exceptions

03:29:01.599 --> 03:29:05.679
Caption: so what that&#39;s defining is the circuit

03:29:03.519 --> 03:29:07.438
Caption: breaker itself saying uh if i catch five

03:29:05.679 --> 03:29:10.478
Caption: sec exceptions

03:29:07.439 --> 03:29:12.640
Caption: and go implement myself and stay active

03:29:10.478 --> 03:29:14.079
Caption: for one minute

03:29:12.639 --> 03:29:16.238
Caption: once i&#39;ve defined the circuit breaker

03:29:14.080 --> 03:29:18.080
Caption: policy i need to then define what to

03:29:16.239 --> 03:29:21.279
Caption: return from the circuit breaker for that

03:29:18.080 --> 03:29:22.799
Caption: one minute when it&#39;s uh in operation

03:29:21.279 --> 03:29:24.479
Caption: and this is another fallback so i&#39;m

03:29:22.799 --> 03:29:27.278
Caption: going to call this one a circuit breaker

03:29:24.478 --> 03:29:29.599
Caption: fallback now i could use my existing

03:29:27.279 --> 03:29:31.600
Caption: fallback if i wanted to but i need to

03:29:29.599 --> 03:29:34.478
Caption: handle this circuit broke exception so

03:29:31.599 --> 03:29:35.839
Caption: this is why i&#39;m implementing a specific

03:29:34.478 --> 03:29:38.799
Caption: fallback for the circuit breaker and

03:29:35.839 --> 03:29:41.599
Caption: also to demonstrate when it&#39;s invoked

03:29:38.799 --> 03:29:46.080
Caption: so on broken circuit exception i need to

03:29:41.599 --> 03:29:46.080
Caption: return another fantastic joke

03:29:46.879 --> 03:29:50.719
Caption: and that&#39;s what i&#39;ll do here so again

03:29:48.719 --> 03:29:52.398
Caption: fallback async

03:29:50.719 --> 03:29:55.200
Caption: which will have a

03:29:52.399 --> 03:29:59.800
Caption: an enumerable of type joke again i&#39;m

03:29:55.200 --> 03:29:59.799
Caption: only returning a single joke for brevity

03:30:07.519 --> 03:30:15.559
Caption: async define cancellation token

03:30:10.879 --> 03:30:15.559
Caption: and let&#39;s define the joke

03:30:22.080 --> 03:30:26.080
Caption: so the joke this time um i&#39;m gonna have

03:30:24.239 --> 03:30:28.319
Caption: to come up with uh something

03:30:26.080 --> 03:30:32.000
Caption: even better than a band of 102 three

03:30:28.319 --> 03:30:34.800
Caption: megabytes so again this is um

03:30:32.000 --> 03:30:37.519
Caption: we&#39;ve got our object so job object that

03:30:34.799 --> 03:30:39.519
Caption: the joke is so a setup punch line and

03:30:37.519 --> 03:30:42.559
Caption: source

03:30:39.519 --> 03:30:44.879
Caption: but this time the source is going to be

03:30:42.559 --> 03:30:48.559
Caption: circuit breaker so we can tell that the

03:30:44.879 --> 03:30:48.559
Caption: actual circuit breaker has been invoked

03:30:55.200 --> 03:30:58.200
Caption: cool

03:30:59.759 --> 03:31:04.799
Caption: and then we add it to our policy wrapper

03:31:02.879 --> 03:31:08.160
Caption: so we want to

03:31:04.799 --> 03:31:10.559
Caption: make sure that this is called

03:31:08.160 --> 03:31:14.959
Caption: after uh five exceptions so we need five

03:31:10.559 --> 03:31:14.959
Caption: exceptions so we put it after the retry

03:31:16.639 --> 03:31:20.719
Caption: we say invoke circuit breaker fallback

03:31:19.359 --> 03:31:23.680
Caption: when

03:31:20.719 --> 03:31:27.559
Caption: the circuit breaker policy happens

03:31:23.679 --> 03:31:27.559
Caption: i.e five exceptions

03:31:31.279 --> 03:31:34.640
Caption: cool and that&#39;s our initial policy at

03:31:33.359 --> 03:31:36.720
Caption: the bottom

03:31:34.639 --> 03:31:39.120
Caption: so what&#39;s gonna happen is

03:31:36.719 --> 03:31:42.160
Caption: we&#39;re gonna set up

03:31:39.120 --> 03:31:44.239
Caption: let&#39;s go so why did

03:31:42.160 --> 03:31:46.879
Caption: why did the developer

03:31:44.239 --> 03:31:46.879
Caption: go broke

03:31:50.719 --> 03:31:54.398
Caption: because

03:31:52.879 --> 03:31:55.599
Caption: they used up

03:31:54.399 --> 03:31:58.479
Caption: all

03:31:55.599 --> 03:31:58.478
Caption: their cash

03:31:58.799 --> 03:32:02.719
Caption: cash

03:32:00.319 --> 03:32:02.720
Caption: thank you

03:32:03.120 --> 03:32:07.040
Caption: um so f5 that

03:32:05.120 --> 03:32:09.839
Caption: and let&#39;s see how our application

03:32:07.040 --> 03:32:09.839
Caption: behaves

03:32:10.399 --> 03:32:15.200
Caption: this is the the application you&#39;re

03:32:12.000 --> 03:32:18.478
Caption: coming to know and love um so

03:32:15.200 --> 03:32:18.479
Caption: let&#39;s go to the ui first

03:32:18.559 --> 03:32:23.599
Caption: so what we&#39;re doing we&#39;re um

03:32:21.200 --> 03:32:26.080
Caption: oh it&#39;s we&#39;ve got into our um circuit

03:32:23.599 --> 03:32:28.799
Caption: breaker right away so

03:32:26.080 --> 03:32:30.879
Caption: uh we&#39;ll refresh that

03:32:28.799 --> 03:32:33.040
Caption: again so as our circuit breaker is

03:32:30.879 --> 03:32:34.799
Caption: invoked we were always going to get our

03:32:33.040 --> 03:32:37.279
Caption: circuit breaker fall back for the next

03:32:34.799 --> 03:32:38.719
Caption: minute so we can refresh refresh you see

03:32:37.279 --> 03:32:39.760
Caption: how responsive the application is

03:32:38.719 --> 03:32:41.040
Caption: getting

03:32:39.759 --> 03:32:44.318
Caption: and it&#39;s always returning in the same

03:32:41.040 --> 03:32:45.599
Caption: joke i.e our circuit breaker fallback

03:32:44.319 --> 03:32:47.520
Caption: which is great

03:32:45.599 --> 03:32:50.159
Caption: but if we wait a minute

03:32:47.519 --> 03:32:54.318
Caption: we should we should then see the state

03:32:50.160 --> 03:32:57.759
Caption: uh change and actually the um we&#39;ll

03:32:54.319 --> 03:33:00.000
Caption: call again our third party api after the

03:32:57.759 --> 03:33:03.599
Caption: um the circuit breaker

03:33:00.000 --> 03:33:06.239
Caption: has went away um for the minute so

03:33:03.599 --> 03:33:07.119
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s um that&#39;s circuit breaker

03:33:06.239 --> 03:33:08.560
Caption: um

03:33:07.120 --> 03:33:11.439
Caption: sometimes

03:33:08.559 --> 03:33:13.599
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it we implemented to just

03:33:11.439 --> 03:33:14.800
Caption: improve the um responsiveness of our

03:33:13.599 --> 03:33:17.599
Caption: application

03:33:14.799 --> 03:33:20.000
Caption: so we&#39;re gonna give it in a minute

03:33:17.599 --> 03:33:22.478
Caption: still active refresh should be a minute

03:33:20.000 --> 03:33:22.478
Caption: by night

03:33:23.279 --> 03:33:27.919
Caption: how many programmers take to change the

03:33:25.359 --> 03:33:30.319
Caption: light bulb it&#39;s a hardware problem none

03:33:27.919 --> 03:33:31.679
Caption: uh third-party api thank you very much

03:33:30.319 --> 03:33:33.760
Caption: for that jam

03:33:31.679 --> 03:33:36.160
Caption: so it&#39;s back so a third-party api is

03:33:33.759 --> 03:33:39.040
Caption: back and now i will we&#39;ll be hitting it

03:33:36.160 --> 03:33:41.439
Caption: again um and if we get have a number of

03:33:39.040 --> 03:33:43.919
Caption: retries that that fall

03:33:41.439 --> 03:33:45.120
Caption: and hit our five that hit our circuit

03:33:43.919 --> 03:33:47.919
Caption: breaker the circuit breaker will be

03:33:45.120 --> 03:33:50.160
Caption: invoked again um but now our third-party

03:33:47.919 --> 03:33:52.319
Caption: duke api is behaving for now uh but

03:33:50.160 --> 03:33:56.799
Caption: we&#39;ve got that uh circuit breaker

03:33:52.319 --> 03:33:56.800
Caption: fallback if if if if we need it

03:33:57.120 --> 03:34:00.560
Caption: cool

03:33:58.080 --> 03:34:04.319
Caption: so that&#39;s that&#39;s um

03:34:00.559 --> 03:34:05.438
Caption: that&#39;s implementing the five practices

03:34:04.319 --> 03:34:08.319
Caption: now

03:34:05.439 --> 03:34:09.600
Caption: i want to end on the practice of chaos

03:34:08.319 --> 03:34:10.640
Caption: engineering because what you&#39;ve just

03:34:09.599 --> 03:34:12.318
Caption: witnessed

03:34:10.639 --> 03:34:14.398
Caption: uh today is

03:34:12.319 --> 03:34:16.800
Caption: the practice of chaos engineering you

03:34:14.399 --> 03:34:19.279
Caption: may not have known it

03:34:16.799 --> 03:34:21.200
Caption: so chaos engineering is the process of

03:34:19.279 --> 03:34:23.040
Caption: stressing an application by creating

03:34:21.200 --> 03:34:25.600
Caption: disruptive events

03:34:23.040 --> 03:34:27.279
Caption: observing how the system responds

03:34:25.599 --> 03:34:29.438
Caption: and implementing improvements so what

03:34:27.279 --> 03:34:31.439
Caption: have we done we&#39;ve stressed our

03:34:29.439 --> 03:34:33.840
Caption: application our application is a

03:34:31.439 --> 03:34:36.160
Caption: third-party joke api we&#39;ve been

03:34:33.839 --> 03:34:38.559
Caption: requesting new jokes and sometimes we&#39;ve

03:34:36.160 --> 03:34:40.959
Caption: been getting some absolute cracking

03:34:38.559 --> 03:34:44.398
Caption: jokes i think you&#39;ll agree and other

03:34:40.959 --> 03:34:45.279
Caption: times um you know it&#39;s it&#39;s broken

03:34:44.399 --> 03:34:47.200
Caption: so

03:34:45.279 --> 03:34:50.160
Caption: we&#39;ve been but when it breaks we&#39;ve been

03:34:47.200 --> 03:34:53.120
Caption: observing how our system responds

03:34:50.160 --> 03:34:57.279
Caption: it has a little spinny wheel it throws

03:34:53.120 --> 03:34:59.359
Caption: exceptions um and with that in mind

03:34:57.279 --> 03:35:02.000
Caption: we&#39;ve started implementing improvements

03:34:59.359 --> 03:35:05.040
Caption: so we&#39;ve implemented retries exponential

03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:07.759
Caption: back offs with jitter and then finally

03:35:05.040 --> 03:35:07.759
Caption: circuit breakers

03:35:08.799 --> 03:35:14.799
Caption: but think of chaos engineering as this

03:35:11.679 --> 03:35:16.879
Caption: lovely little wheel

03:35:14.799 --> 03:35:19.040
Caption: and where we start with steady state our

03:35:16.879 --> 03:35:22.080
Caption: application is happy

03:35:19.040 --> 03:35:24.879
Caption: we then come up with a hypothesis

03:35:22.080 --> 03:35:26.399
Caption: i can nearly speak and we think well

03:35:24.879 --> 03:35:28.959
Caption: what will happen to our application if

03:35:26.399 --> 03:35:28.959
Caption: we do x

03:35:29.120 --> 03:35:33.919
Caption: so let&#39;s do that using the aws fault

03:35:31.919 --> 03:35:35.679
Caption: injection simulator this is what i&#39;ve

03:35:33.919 --> 03:35:38.719
Caption: been using to

03:35:35.679 --> 03:35:42.719
Caption: kill the third-party joke api

03:35:38.719 --> 03:35:42.719
Caption: so what i do i create an experiment

03:35:43.120 --> 03:35:46.080
Caption: and i create an experiment using an

03:35:44.639 --> 03:35:47.199
Caption: experiment template where i go

03:35:46.080 --> 03:35:49.120
Caption: description

03:35:47.200 --> 03:35:51.200
Caption: stop instances

03:35:49.120 --> 03:35:53.679
Caption: i then

03:35:51.200 --> 03:35:55.200
Caption: give it a roll so it allows me to stop

03:35:53.679 --> 03:35:59.040
Caption: those instances

03:35:55.200 --> 03:36:02.000
Caption: i then um give it an action so again i

03:35:59.040 --> 03:36:04.080
Caption: just want to stop the instances please

03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:05.919
Caption: a brief description

03:36:04.080 --> 03:36:08.479
Caption: and then an action type so the action

03:36:05.919 --> 03:36:10.080
Caption: type is you choose a service you want to

03:36:08.478 --> 03:36:13.358
Caption: invoke this action on

03:36:10.080 --> 03:36:13.359
Caption: and in this case the ec2

03:36:14.319 --> 03:36:18.080
Caption: and then you give it a duration so i&#39;m

03:36:16.000 --> 03:36:20.559
Caption: stopping my ec2 instances that are

03:36:18.080 --> 03:36:22.959
Caption: running the third duke api for a minute

03:36:20.559 --> 03:36:25.199
Caption: and that&#39;s my hypothesis that i&#39;m

03:36:22.959 --> 03:36:27.519
Caption: defining here

03:36:25.200 --> 03:36:30.160
Caption: i define what i&#39;m going to target by

03:36:27.519 --> 03:36:32.079
Caption: using tags so all of the ec2 instances

03:36:30.160 --> 03:36:34.879
Caption: that are running my third-party joke api

03:36:32.080 --> 03:36:38.479
Caption: are all tagged with the value of api

03:36:34.879 --> 03:36:38.478
Caption: so i i set that up here

03:36:39.439 --> 03:36:43.120
Caption: and then i create my experiment it gives

03:36:41.120 --> 03:36:46.080
Caption: you all these warnings because you

03:36:43.120 --> 03:36:48.399
Caption: actually are going to stop real

03:36:46.080 --> 03:36:51.439
Caption: instances and there they are they&#39;re

03:36:48.399 --> 03:36:56.080
Caption: running at the minute they&#39;re happy um

03:36:51.439 --> 03:36:58.239
Caption: and i can then run my experiment

03:36:56.080 --> 03:37:00.160
Caption: another warning because even though it&#39;s

03:36:58.239 --> 03:37:02.560
Caption: called the fault injection simulator it

03:37:00.160 --> 03:37:05.200
Caption: actually does stop the things

03:37:02.559 --> 03:37:07.919
Caption: um so that&#39;s why there&#39;s all these

03:37:05.200 --> 03:37:10.560
Caption: warnings so what&#39;s happening now is my

03:37:07.919 --> 03:37:11.759
Caption: experiment is starting to run

03:37:10.559 --> 03:37:13.438
Caption: and currently

03:37:11.759 --> 03:37:15.599
Caption: if i keep refreshing

03:37:13.439 --> 03:37:17.520
Caption: you&#39;ll see that although my apis are

03:37:15.599 --> 03:37:21.040
Caption: starting to run i just give it some time

03:37:17.519 --> 03:37:22.478
Caption: for this experiment to invoke

03:37:21.040 --> 03:37:24.719
Caption: now it&#39;s running

03:37:22.478 --> 03:37:26.318
Caption: i refresh my third-party joke apis and

03:37:24.719 --> 03:37:28.238
Caption: they&#39;re all stopping

03:37:26.319 --> 03:37:30.000
Caption: and so now

03:37:28.239 --> 03:37:31.760
Caption: my application that&#39;s calling this

03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:34.559
Caption: third-party joke api needs to deal with

03:37:31.759 --> 03:37:36.080
Caption: these things stopping

03:37:34.559 --> 03:37:38.719
Caption: and this is where we go to the next

03:37:36.080 --> 03:37:41.839
Caption: phase in this cycle after we&#39;ve run our

03:37:38.719 --> 03:37:43.679
Caption: experiment within verify so verify

03:37:41.839 --> 03:37:45.040
Caption: verification is

03:37:43.679 --> 03:37:47.358
Caption: what we were doing earlier we were

03:37:45.040 --> 03:37:50.000
Caption: running our application and verifying

03:37:47.359 --> 03:37:51.760
Caption: what was happening

03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:53.919
Caption: then after a minute and we&#39;ve ran our

03:37:51.759 --> 03:37:55.839
Caption: application and uh our api is not

03:37:53.919 --> 03:37:58.398
Caption: working we&#39;ve built our resilient

03:37:55.839 --> 03:38:00.879
Caption: applications and build our patterns

03:37:58.399 --> 03:38:02.640
Caption: the apis actually come back

03:38:00.879 --> 03:38:05.358
Caption: because the fault injection simulator

03:38:02.639 --> 03:38:09.358
Caption: experiment defined a minute and so our

03:38:05.359 --> 03:38:10.319
Caption: apis are now working as as they should

03:38:09.359 --> 03:38:11.680
Caption: so that

03:38:10.319 --> 03:38:15.120
Caption: is

03:38:11.679 --> 03:38:16.959
Caption: how we define chaos engineering we have

03:38:15.120 --> 03:38:19.359
Caption: verified what happens when the third

03:38:16.959 --> 03:38:21.120
Caption: party apis are down for a minute and

03:38:19.359 --> 03:38:24.160
Caption: then we start improving them and we

03:38:21.120 --> 03:38:28.319
Caption: improve and we improve them using the um

03:38:24.160 --> 03:38:28.319
Caption: the patterns that i defined earlier

03:38:29.439 --> 03:38:34.319
Caption: as well as stopping instances we can do

03:38:31.679 --> 03:38:35.679
Caption: other things in ec2s ecs container

03:38:34.319 --> 03:38:37.359
Caption: systems

03:38:35.679 --> 03:38:38.398

Caption: so a lot of different services in aws

03:38:41.200 --> 03:38:48.479
Caption: support fault injection

03:38:43.759 --> 03:38:50.639
Caption: and this is what we&#39;ve done today so um

03:38:48.478 --> 03:38:52.639

Caption: so when i first wrote this talk

03:52:16.239 --> 03:52:20.959
Caption: i was look talking about being more

03:52:18.639 --> 03:52:22.799

Caption: and

03:52:42.879 --> 03:52:46.639
Caption: thought i&#39;d put together a bit of a

03:52:44.559 --> 03:52:48.799
Caption: presentation to share

03:52:46.639 --> 03:52:50.238

Caption: now

03:54:28.239 --> 03:54:33.199

03:54:31.759 --> 03:54:36.238
Caption: burnout

03:54:33.199 --> 03:54:38.799

03:54:36.239 --> 03:54:41.199
Caption: industry a few years ago i went through

03:54:38.799 --> 03:54:43.679
Caption: a bit of a month i started a new job i

03:54:41.199 --> 03:54:46.560
Caption: interviewed and hired a bunch of staff i

03:54:43.679 --> 03:54:49.358

03:54:51.519 --> 03:54:56.398

Caption: planning two parties

03:55:02.239 --> 03:55:04.560
Caption: so

03:55:03.199 --> 03:55:06.560
Caption: oddly enough

03:55:04.559 --> 03:55:08.318
Caption: at the end of all this

03:55:06.559 --> 03:55:10.719
Caption: i burnt out

03:55:08.319 --> 03:55:12.560
Caption: but i didn&#39;t understand that i&#39;d burnt

03:55:10.719 --> 03:55:14.719
Caption: out i didn&#39;t learn and i didn&#39;t actually

03:55:12.559 --> 03:55:17.438
Caption: take time to have a break for myself so

03:55:14.719 --> 03:55:20.559
Caption: although i recovered it took me a really

03:55:17.439 --> 03:55:22.399
Caption: long time to get there

03:55:20.559 --> 03:55:24.959
Caption: several years after this

03:55:22.399 --> 03:55:28.720
Caption: i was working at a digital agency

03:55:24.959 --> 03:55:30.799
Caption: working 60 to 70 hour weeks

03:55:28.719 --> 03:55:33.120
Caption: i was having trouble sleeping i got to

03:55:30.799 --> 03:55:34.639
Caption: the point where i was constantly dizzy

03:55:33.120 --> 03:55:35.679
Caption: and nauseous

03:55:34.639 --> 03:55:37.679
Caption: and

03:55:35.679 --> 03:55:39.519
Caption: i recognized

03:55:37.679 --> 03:55:40.839
Caption: that i&#39;d experienced these symptoms

03:55:39.519 --> 03:55:43.119
Caption: before

03:55:40.839 --> 03:55:45.679
Caption: thankfully since then

03:55:43.120 --> 03:55:47.839
Caption: i had been to a local meetup that talked

03:55:45.679 --> 03:55:51.040
Caption: about mental health and i realized i was

03:55:47.839 --> 03:55:53.279
Caption: experiencing burnout and this time i

03:55:51.040 --> 03:55:56.479
Caption: decided to actually do something about

03:55:53.279 --> 03:55:59.120
Caption: it so i went to my local gp i got a

03:55:56.478 --> 03:56:02.159
Caption: referral to see a psychologist and my gp

03:55:59.120 --> 03:56:05.040
Caption: made me take a week off work

03:56:02.160 --> 03:56:07.279
Caption: while i had my week off work i got a

03:56:05.040 --> 03:56:08.639
Caption: phone call from my boss who said look i

03:56:07.279 --> 03:56:10.479
Caption: know you&#39;re off sick

03:56:08.639 --> 03:56:13.120
Caption: can you come in anyway

03:56:10.478 --> 03:56:14.799
Caption: and have a chat

03:56:13.120 --> 03:56:17.040
Caption: this is clearly going to be a promotion

03:56:14.799 --> 03:56:17.040
Caption: right

03:56:17.439 --> 03:56:22.560
Caption: i got made redundant with a week&#39;s

03:56:19.439 --> 03:56:26.479
Caption: notice at a time when noah&#39;s was hiring

03:56:22.559 --> 03:56:28.000
Caption: for my role right before christmas

03:56:26.478 --> 03:56:28.879
Caption: the next day

03:56:28.000 --> 03:56:30.719
Caption: i

03:56:28.879 --> 03:56:32.000
Caption: had a meeting with the psychologist i&#39;d

03:56:30.719 --> 03:56:34.398
Caption: been referred to

03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:36.160
Caption: and because he had the referral he said

03:56:34.399 --> 03:56:38.720
Caption: you&#39;re here for work stress

03:56:36.160 --> 03:56:41.279
Caption: how&#39;s that going

03:56:38.719 --> 03:56:44.000
Caption: and i laughed

03:56:41.279 --> 03:56:45.919
Caption: i had no job

03:56:44.000 --> 03:56:47.519
Caption: i wasn&#39;t entirely sure how i was going

03:56:45.919 --> 03:56:50.719
Caption: to pay my rent

03:56:47.519 --> 03:56:51.759
Caption: and yet somehow i felt better than i had

03:56:50.719 --> 03:56:54.318
Caption: in

03:56:51.759 --> 03:56:54.318
Caption: months

03:56:55.040 --> 03:56:57.679
Caption: now

03:56:55.919 --> 03:57:00.879
Caption: i&#39;m a bit of a warrior

03:56:57.679 --> 03:57:02.559
Caption: so this situation where i didn&#39;t have a

03:57:00.879 --> 03:57:03.839
Caption: job and i didn&#39;t really know what i was

03:57:02.559 --> 03:57:06.879
Caption: going to do

03:57:03.839 --> 03:57:11.839
Caption: really should have been more concerning

03:57:06.879 --> 03:57:13.358
Caption: but although i was worried i&#39;d realized

03:57:11.839 --> 03:57:15.759
Caption: that there is actually different there&#39;s

03:57:13.359 --> 03:57:17.520
Caption: different kinds of worry there&#39;s

03:57:15.759 --> 03:57:19.679
Caption: good worry

03:57:17.519 --> 03:57:22.079
Caption: and bad worry

03:57:19.679 --> 03:57:23.198
Caption: now the good worry is worry that is

03:57:22.080 --> 03:57:24.879
Caption: useful

03:57:23.199 --> 03:57:28.000
Caption: this is worry that you can actually do

03:57:24.879 --> 03:57:30.000
Caption: something about so in my situation it&#39;s

03:57:28.000 --> 03:57:32.559
Caption: worry where i can

03:57:30.000 --> 03:57:36.478
Caption: apply for jobs and pick up some extra

03:57:32.559 --> 03:57:38.559
Caption: work and maybe stop ubereating dinner

03:57:36.478 --> 03:57:41.519
Caption: every night and

03:57:38.559 --> 03:57:43.278
Caption: steal somebody else&#39;s netflix password

03:57:41.519 --> 03:57:45.599
Caption: there were things that i could do to

03:57:43.279 --> 03:57:46.879
Caption: make the situation better

03:57:45.599 --> 03:57:49.278
Caption: from there

03:57:46.879 --> 03:57:51.679
Caption: there wasn&#39;t anything that i was able to

03:57:49.279 --> 03:57:53.520
Caption: do to make the situation better the

03:57:51.679 --> 03:57:55.438
Caption: worry wasn&#39;t useful and it was turning

03:57:53.519 --> 03:57:56.559
Caption: into bad worry

03:57:55.439 --> 03:57:58.800
Caption: so

03:57:56.559 --> 03:58:01.919
Caption: i taught myself what i attempted to

03:57:58.799 --> 03:58:04.080
Caption: teach myself to stop the worry when it&#39;s

03:58:01.919 --> 03:58:05.839
Caption: not useful

03:58:04.080 --> 03:58:08.959
Caption: once again

03:58:05.839 --> 03:58:11.120
Caption: this isn&#39;t something that i can just do

03:58:08.959 --> 03:58:13.279
Caption: i don&#39;t have a switch that says okay the

03:58:11.120 --> 03:58:16.000
Caption: good worry is done i&#39;m gonna stop

03:58:13.279 --> 03:58:18.080
Caption: worrying now if anyone happens to manage

03:58:16.000 --> 03:58:21.199
Caption: to do that that would be great if you

03:58:18.080 --> 03:58:22.000
Caption: could let us know the secret

03:58:21.199 --> 03:58:24.479
Caption: but

03:58:22.000 --> 03:58:26.239
Caption: there is often things that you can do

03:58:24.478 --> 03:58:27.919
Caption: when you

03:58:26.239 --> 03:58:29.520
Caption: when you find yourself starting to worry

03:58:27.919 --> 03:58:32.719
Caption: so work out whether is there anything

03:58:29.519 --> 03:58:35.358
Caption: you can do to change the situation or

03:58:32.719 --> 03:58:37.120
Caption: is this not useful worry

03:58:35.359 --> 03:58:40.239
Caption: this was been really useful when i gave

03:58:37.120 --> 03:58:43.520
Caption: my first conference talk oddly enough i

03:58:40.239 --> 03:58:45.680
Caption: was a little bit worried so i practiced

03:58:43.519 --> 03:58:48.159
Caption: i prepared i thought of absolutely

03:58:45.679 --> 03:58:51.040
Caption: everything that could possibly go wrong

03:58:48.160 --> 03:58:53.919
Caption: and i worked out what i could do in each

03:58:51.040 --> 03:58:56.000
Caption: situation i worried

03:58:53.919 --> 03:58:57.599
Caption: and then i worked out how i could combat

03:58:56.000 --> 03:58:58.719
Caption: my worries

03:58:57.599 --> 03:59:00.639
Caption: after

03:58:58.719 --> 03:59:02.238
Caption: i had done everything i could do there

03:59:00.639 --> 03:59:05.358
Caption: wasn&#39;t anything i could do to make it

03:59:02.239 --> 03:59:08.080
Caption: better so there was no point me worrying

03:59:05.359 --> 03:59:10.840
Caption: once again this isn&#39;t a switch

03:59:08.080 --> 03:59:13.839
Caption: that i can turn off

03:59:10.839 --> 03:59:16.318
Caption: i thankfully at that point in time the

03:59:13.839 --> 03:59:18.478
Caption: worry was able to

03:59:16.319 --> 03:59:20.640
Caption: that worry helped me to give a really

03:59:18.478 --> 03:59:22.639
Caption: good talk i was prepared for the fact

03:59:20.639 --> 03:59:25.120
Caption: that there were av issues

03:59:22.639 --> 03:59:26.478
Caption: and a bunch of things didn&#39;t work

03:59:25.120 --> 03:59:28.560
Caption: but

03:59:26.478 --> 03:59:32.959
Caption: there&#39;s still a whole lot of worry that

03:59:28.559 --> 03:59:32.959
Caption: i didn&#39;t need to have afterwards

03:59:33.839 --> 03:59:39.279
Caption: and if you think

03:59:35.599 --> 03:59:41.040
Caption: that i&#39;ve clearly learnt by now to just

03:59:39.279 --> 03:59:44.959
Caption: stop the worrying

03:59:41.040 --> 03:59:46.239
Caption: i invite you to organize a conference

03:59:44.959 --> 03:59:48.399
Caption: when there&#39;s a lot of things to worry

03:59:46.239 --> 03:59:50.640
Caption: about so if anyone thinks that i&#39;ve

03:59:48.399 --> 03:59:52.880
Caption: managed to nail this whole you know not

03:59:50.639 --> 03:59:56.398
Caption: worrying thing

03:59:52.879 --> 03:59:58.799
Caption: try finding a backup speaker two hours

03:59:56.399 --> 04:00:00.560
Caption: before a session starts in case anyone

03:59:58.799 --> 04:00:01.919
Caption: didn&#39;t catch some of our last minute

04:00:00.559 --> 04:00:02.959
Caption: agenda changes

04:00:01.919 --> 04:00:05.438
Caption: after

04:00:02.959 --> 04:00:09.399
Caption: we announced that there had been last

04:00:05.439 --> 04:00:09.399
Caption: minute agenda changes

04:00:10.319 --> 04:00:15.520
Caption: next i want to talk about being

04:00:12.959 --> 04:00:16.799
Caption: productive has anyone here spent a

04:00:15.519 --> 04:00:19.679
Caption: weekend

04:00:16.799 --> 04:00:21.679
Caption: where you get to the end of sunday and

04:00:19.679 --> 04:00:24.719
Caption: you kind of feel like you&#39;ve absolutely

04:00:21.679 --> 04:00:24.719
Caption: done nothing at all

04:00:26.399 --> 04:00:31.359
Caption: who here feels bad because they&#39;ve done

04:00:28.719 --> 04:00:31.358
Caption: nothing at all

04:00:31.759 --> 04:00:36.639
Caption: cool i&#39;ve done that

04:00:34.319 --> 04:00:39.359
Caption: have you ever realized that generally

04:00:36.639 --> 04:00:40.959
Caption: when you&#39;ve had these weekends it&#39;s

04:00:39.359 --> 04:00:42.640
Caption: usually after you&#39;ve had a really

04:00:40.959 --> 04:00:44.639
Caption: full-on week

04:00:42.639 --> 04:00:47.919
Caption: and you&#39;re a bit knackered

04:00:44.639 --> 04:00:47.919
Caption: and you kind of need the break

04:00:48.959 --> 04:00:55.279
Caption: so i reframed

04:00:52.478 --> 04:00:57.599
Caption: my thinking instead of

04:00:55.279 --> 04:01:00.479
Caption: i wasn&#39;t productive i just watched

04:00:57.599 --> 04:01:03.679
Caption: netflix for two days it was

04:01:00.478 --> 04:01:06.398
Caption: actually i&#39;ve been really tired i&#39;ve

04:01:03.679 --> 04:01:10.559
Caption: been really worn out i need the break

04:01:06.399 --> 04:01:12.560
Caption: and my body needs a chance to recharge

04:01:10.559 --> 04:01:14.959
Caption: so i made sure that i was actually

04:01:12.559 --> 04:01:17.198
Caption: finding the time to prioritize me

04:01:14.959 --> 04:01:18.399
Caption: and stopped feeling

04:01:17.199 --> 04:01:19.520
Caption: like i was

04:01:18.399 --> 04:01:22.160
Caption: lazy

04:01:19.519 --> 04:01:24.478
Caption: or unproductive instead

04:01:22.160 --> 04:01:26.560
Caption: prioritizing me and giving me the chance

04:01:24.478 --> 04:01:29.599
Caption: to recharge was something that i

04:01:26.559 --> 04:01:29.599
Caption: actually had to do

04:01:30.478 --> 04:01:35.278
Caption: now this went a step further after i

04:01:33.759 --> 04:01:37.919
Caption: then saw a

04:01:35.279 --> 04:01:39.359
Caption: meetup event where someone talked about

04:01:37.919 --> 04:01:41.519
Caption: time boxing

04:01:39.359 --> 04:01:44.560
Caption: and the speaker actually talked about

04:01:41.519 --> 04:01:47.278
Caption: how they time box their own personal

04:01:44.559 --> 04:01:49.358
Caption: time these are calendar events that

04:01:47.279 --> 04:01:51.600
Caption: cannot be moved they cannot be

04:01:49.359 --> 04:01:52.959
Caption: overwritten and this is time that is set

04:01:51.599 --> 04:01:53.919
Caption: aside

04:01:52.959 --> 04:01:57.759
Caption: for

04:01:53.919 --> 04:02:00.559
Caption: me this is me time

04:01:57.759 --> 04:02:02.559
Caption: by making sure that i have a conscious

04:02:00.559 --> 04:02:05.919
Caption: make a conscious effort i don&#39;t feel

04:02:02.559 --> 04:02:07.919
Caption: like i&#39;m being unproductive anymore and

04:02:05.919 --> 04:02:09.040
Caption: i&#39;m able to look after myself a bit

04:02:07.919 --> 04:02:11.519
Caption: better

04:02:09.040 --> 04:02:14.000
Caption: now this doesn&#39;t have to be

04:02:11.519 --> 04:02:15.839
Caption: you know an hour blocked out it could be

04:02:14.000 --> 04:02:18.160
Caption: five minutes before you go to bed to

04:02:15.839 --> 04:02:20.799
Caption: read a book and have a cup of tea

04:02:18.160 --> 04:02:24.479
Caption: work out what it is that helps you

04:02:20.799 --> 04:02:26.398
Caption: recharge and find the time for it

04:02:24.478 --> 04:02:27.358
Caption: i like to think of

04:02:26.399 --> 04:02:31.439
Caption: our

04:02:27.359 --> 04:02:34.239
Caption: energy in terms of the zelda stamina bar

04:02:31.439 --> 04:02:37.120
Caption: if anybody is familiar

04:02:34.239 --> 04:02:39.520
Caption: as long as you don&#39;t reach the end if

04:02:37.120 --> 04:02:41.199
Caption: you keep resting it comes back fairly

04:02:39.519 --> 04:02:43.039
Caption: quickly so as long as you take short

04:02:41.199 --> 04:02:44.399
Caption: regular breaks it doesn&#39;t take long to

04:02:43.040 --> 04:02:46.000
Caption: recharge

04:02:44.399 --> 04:02:49.040
Caption: but

04:02:46.000 --> 04:02:51.120
Caption: if you go all the way to the end

04:02:49.040 --> 04:02:53.919
Caption: and run out of stamina

04:02:51.120 --> 04:02:56.959
Caption: it takes a really long time before you

04:02:53.919 --> 04:02:59.919
Caption: can get back into the swing of things

04:02:56.959 --> 04:03:01.359
Caption: now this might be something different

04:02:59.919 --> 04:03:04.559
Caption: for each of you

04:03:01.359 --> 04:03:06.800
Caption: it might be some time alone

04:03:04.559 --> 04:03:09.040
Caption: if you&#39;re an extrovert you might like to

04:03:06.799 --> 04:03:12.000
Caption: have some time with friends

04:03:09.040 --> 04:03:14.160
Caption: if you&#39;re very special like me it might

04:03:12.000 --> 04:03:17.199
Caption: be spending time at a conference with a

04:03:14.160 --> 04:03:20.479
Caption: thousand other people so find what helps

04:03:17.199 --> 04:03:22.959
Caption: you recharge and schedule that in

04:03:20.478 --> 04:03:24.879
Caption: this will also change as well i talked

04:03:22.959 --> 04:03:26.879
Caption: about how i like to travel

04:03:24.879 --> 04:03:28.719
Caption: so it&#39;s a little bit tricky for me to

04:03:26.879 --> 04:03:30.319
Caption: sit down and have a cup of tea and read

04:03:28.719 --> 04:03:33.358
Caption: a book when i&#39;m spending a lot of time

04:03:30.319 --> 04:03:35.680
Caption: at conferences so i&#39;ve worked out my own

04:03:33.359 --> 04:03:38.560
Caption: ways that i can recharge when i&#39;m on the

04:03:35.679 --> 04:03:41.519
Caption: road whether that&#39;s oddly enough staying

04:03:38.559 --> 04:03:44.559
Caption: up until 3am catching up with friends

04:03:41.519 --> 04:03:47.278
Caption: or watching a trashy movie on the plane

04:03:44.559 --> 04:03:50.079
Caption: working out what helps me recharge

04:03:47.279 --> 04:03:50.080
Caption: wherever i am

04:03:51.359 --> 04:03:55.439
Caption: boundaries

04:03:52.719 --> 04:03:57.120
Caption: are a word that we love

04:03:55.439 --> 04:03:59.279
Caption: and hate

04:03:57.120 --> 04:04:02.000
Caption: when i first started my business i

04:03:59.279 --> 04:04:04.800
Caption: prided myself on the fact that wherever

04:04:02.000 --> 04:04:07.919
Caption: i was at whatever time my clients could

04:04:04.799 --> 04:04:10.639
Caption: call me and i could help them out

04:04:07.919 --> 04:04:14.160
Caption: but as my business grew i discovered

04:04:10.639 --> 04:04:16.159
Caption: that this isn&#39;t super scalable

04:04:14.160 --> 04:04:17.439
Caption: i mean it&#39;s okay when i have one or two

04:04:16.160 --> 04:04:19.359
Caption: clients but

04:04:17.439 --> 04:04:21.600
Caption: when i have 20

04:04:19.359 --> 04:04:23.520
Caption: i was constantly context switching

04:04:21.599 --> 04:04:26.000
Caption: between phone calls and emails and

04:04:23.519 --> 04:04:28.000
Caption: actually getting the work done

04:04:26.000 --> 04:04:30.559
Caption: i wasn&#39;t getting anything done

04:04:28.000 --> 04:04:31.599
Caption: but i saw at a meet-up event they talked

04:04:30.559 --> 04:04:33.759
Caption: about

04:04:31.599 --> 04:04:36.238
Caption: employee the employer employee

04:04:33.759 --> 04:04:39.278
Caption: relationship the same as we think of

04:04:36.239 --> 04:04:41.199
Caption: romantic or personal relationships

04:04:39.279 --> 04:04:42.080
Caption: and so i had to think

04:04:41.199 --> 04:04:45.680
Caption: if

04:04:42.080 --> 04:04:48.319
Caption: you have a friend or a partner who&#39;s

04:04:45.679 --> 04:04:51.120
Caption: constantly calling you day and night

04:04:48.319 --> 04:04:54.479
Caption: even when you say you can&#39;t talk

04:04:51.120 --> 04:04:55.600
Caption: who keeps hassling you and won&#39;t leave

04:04:54.478 --> 04:04:57.919
Caption: you alone

04:04:55.599 --> 04:04:59.599
Caption: and doesn&#39;t like you spending time with

04:04:57.919 --> 04:05:01.199
Caption: your other friends

04:04:59.599 --> 04:05:03.839
Caption: does this sound like a healthy

04:05:01.199 --> 04:05:03.839
Caption: relationship

04:05:05.279 --> 04:05:08.160
Caption: not really

04:05:08.879 --> 04:05:12.719
Caption: so

04:05:10.080 --> 04:05:15.359
Caption: i implemented boundaries

04:05:12.719 --> 04:05:17.358
Caption: i let my clients know

04:05:15.359 --> 04:05:18.959
Caption: that i would only be taking phone calls

04:05:17.359 --> 04:05:20.479
Caption: if it was urgent

04:05:18.959 --> 04:05:22.559
Caption: i let them know i would be answering

04:05:20.478 --> 04:05:24.478
Caption: emails twice a day

04:05:22.559 --> 04:05:26.959
Caption: and for the most part my clients

04:05:24.478 --> 04:05:28.559
Caption: respected this choice they followed the

04:05:26.959 --> 04:05:32.000
Caption: boundaries that i had set and the

04:05:28.559 --> 04:05:34.959
Caption: working relationship continued well

04:05:32.000 --> 04:05:34.959
Caption: the other clients

04:05:35.120 --> 04:05:39.199
Caption: is not to say they didn&#39;t

04:05:37.279 --> 04:05:40.879
Caption: agree to the boundaries because they

04:05:39.199 --> 04:05:43.680
Caption: never said they didn&#39;t like them they

04:05:40.879 --> 04:05:45.679
Caption: just ignored them completely

04:05:43.679 --> 04:05:48.398
Caption: kept doing the exact same thing to the

04:05:45.679 --> 04:05:51.278
Caption: point that one of them asked me to come

04:05:48.399 --> 04:05:52.160
Caption: in and work at eight pm on a monday

04:05:51.279 --> 04:05:55.919
Caption: night

04:05:52.160 --> 04:05:55.919
Caption: in exchange for beer

04:05:56.160 --> 04:06:02.799
Caption: i don&#39;t drink beer

04:05:59.519 --> 04:06:02.799
Caption: beer doesn&#39;t pay my rent

04:06:03.599 --> 04:06:07.839
Caption: and i know it&#39;s a monday night but i&#39;ve

04:06:04.879 --> 04:06:10.319
Caption: got better things to do so oddly enough

04:06:07.839 --> 04:06:12.799
Caption: they&#39;re not clients anymore

04:06:10.319 --> 04:06:15.359
Caption: as i expanded i was then able to be a

04:06:12.799 --> 04:06:17.438
Caption: little bit pickier and apply these

Caption: and i was able to step through each

04:06:30.478 --> 04:06:34.959
Caption: decision and actually work out whether

04:06:32.399 --> 04:06:37.040

04:06:34.959 --> 04:06:38.879

04:06:45.120 --> 04:06:50.319

04:06:52.239 --> 04:06:58.879

Caption: of not giving an f

04:06:58.879 --> 04:07:01.438

04:06:59.679 --> 04:07:03.120
Caption: while we talked about a lot of obvious

04:07:01.439 --> 04:07:05.040
Caption: stuff it did make some really good

04:07:03.120 --> 04:07:07.600
Caption: points including i liked one of the

04:07:05.040 --> 04:07:11.120
Caption: points which was whether you realize it

04:07:07.599 --> 04:07:12.000
Caption: or not you&#39;re always choosing

04:07:11.120 --> 04:07:14.959

04:07:12.000 --> 04:07:14.959
Caption: to give a about

04:07:15.279 --> 04:07:19.680
Caption: and so

04:07:16.559 --> 04:07:19.679
Caption: i started thinking

04:07:19.919 --> 04:07:25.679
Caption: about how i allocate

04:07:23.040 --> 04:07:25.679
Caption: my ducks

04:07:26.080 --> 04:07:30.560

04:07:29.199 --> 04:07:34.560
Caption: that

04:07:30.559 --> 04:07:36.959
Caption: you care a moderate level about

04:07:34.559 --> 04:07:39.919
Caption: like maybe what computer your employer

04:07:36.959 --> 04:07:41.359

Caption: at ddd

04:07:41.359 --> 04:07:45.040
Caption: you might choose to give this situation

04:07:43.679 --> 04:07:47.438
Caption: three ducks

04:07:45.040 --> 04:07:48.639
Caption: ten ducks per situation give this three

04:07:47.439 --> 04:07:51.920
Caption: ducks

04:07:48.639 --> 04:07:53.198
Caption: maybe there&#39;s something that you care

04:07:51.919 --> 04:07:54.478
Caption: about

04:07:53.199 --> 04:07:55.839
Caption: a lot more

04:07:54.478 --> 04:07:58.559
Caption: like

04:07:55.839 --> 04:08:00.719
Caption: whether you get a ticket to ddd

04:07:58.559 --> 04:08:03.040
Caption: you might give that situation

04:08:00.719 --> 04:08:06.799
Caption: nine ducks nine out of ten ducks it&#39;s

04:08:03.040 --> 04:08:06.799
Caption: pretty important situation

04:08:06.879 --> 04:08:09.759
Caption: maybe

04:08:07.759 --> 04:08:13.199
Caption: there&#39;s a decision but you just don&#39;t

04:08:09.759 --> 04:08:15.759
Caption: really care about the outcome as much

04:08:13.199 --> 04:08:19.479
Caption: you just have no ducks

04:08:15.759 --> 04:08:19.478
Caption: left to give it all

04:08:19.519 --> 04:08:22.799
Caption: so

04:08:20.319 --> 04:08:25.120
Caption: i started thinking about how i&#39;m

04:08:22.799 --> 04:08:26.799
Caption: allocating my ducks

04:08:25.120 --> 04:08:28.399
Caption: am i giving

04:08:26.799 --> 04:08:31.120
Caption: too many ducks

04:08:28.399 --> 04:08:35.279
Caption: am i giving two little ducks

04:08:31.120 --> 04:08:37.919
Caption: am i giving ducks in places that i

04:08:35.279 --> 04:08:39.839
Caption: shouldn&#39;t or to people who don&#39;t deserve

04:08:37.919 --> 04:08:40.959
Caption: them

04:08:39.839 --> 04:08:43.040
Caption: because

04:08:40.959 --> 04:08:45.599
Caption: we need to be careful about how we&#39;re

04:08:43.040 --> 04:08:48.319
Caption: allocating our ducks if you give too

04:08:45.599 --> 04:08:50.159
Caption: many ducks or in the wrong places

04:08:48.319 --> 04:08:52.399
Caption: we may end up

04:08:50.160 --> 04:08:52.399
Caption: with

04:08:52.478 --> 04:08:57.039
Caption: very few ducks left

04:08:55.040 --> 04:09:01.279
Caption: we may end up

04:08:57.040 --> 04:09:03.359
Caption: with no ducks left to give at all

04:09:01.279 --> 04:09:07.040
Caption: but

04:09:03.359 --> 04:09:09.520
Caption: if we&#39;re really stingy with our ducks

04:09:07.040 --> 04:09:13.359
Caption: we may find that we have a lot of ducks

04:09:09.519 --> 04:09:15.839
Caption: to give and nothing left to give them

04:09:13.359 --> 04:09:15.840
Caption: on

04:09:17.279 --> 04:09:21.520
Caption: and so on that note

04:09:19.199 --> 04:09:24.000
Caption: i want to come back to sustainability

04:09:21.519 --> 04:09:26.959
Caption: which is defined as the avoidance of the

04:09:24.000 --> 04:09:29.679

Caption: to main ecological balance

04:09:29.679 --> 04:09:33.679

04:09:31.919 --> 04:09:36.080
Caption: avoidance

04:09:33.679 --> 04:09:37.679

Caption: balance

04:09:39.439 --> 04:09:42.800

Caption: are boundaries that are going to happen

04:10:10.319 --> 04:10:13.840
Caption: and most importantly

04:10:12.559 --> 04:10:17.119
Caption: have a think

04:10:13.839 --> 04:10:19.599

Caption: speaker we&#39;ve got ben lowry talking

04:20:32.959 --> 04:20:37.959
Caption: about offline first not offline mode

04:20:40.080 --> 04:20:45.439
Caption: hey everybody uh so yeah talking hearing

04:20:43.040 --> 04:20:47.199
Caption: to talk about offline first not offline

04:20:45.439 --> 04:20:49.439
Caption: mode like carriage is set

04:20:47.199 --> 04:20:51.359
Caption: uh if you don&#39;t have any idea what that

04:20:49.439 --> 04:20:52.880
Caption: might be related to it&#39;s basically

04:20:51.359 --> 04:20:54.479
Caption: talking about applications that work

04:20:52.879 --> 04:20:56.000
Caption: offline now

04:20:54.478 --> 04:20:57.438
Caption: it can be difficult to build an app that

04:20:56.000 --> 04:20:58.559
Caption: works offline

04:20:57.439 --> 04:21:01.279
Caption: there are a bunch of challenges and

04:20:58.559 --> 04:21:02.478
Caption: stuff that we&#39;ll talk about as we go on

04:21:01.279 --> 04:21:03.839
Caption: and obviously a lot of benefits that

04:21:02.478 --> 04:21:05.198
Caption: come with it otherwise why would you

04:21:03.839 --> 04:21:06.879
Caption: bother

04:21:05.199 --> 04:21:10.000
Caption: right off the bat i want to thank

04:21:06.879 --> 04:21:11.759

Caption: uh it&#39;s really nice

04:21:11.759 --> 04:21:17.278
Caption: uh the rest of the

04:21:13.519 --> 04:21:20.000
Caption: talk is more like this

04:21:17.279 --> 04:21:20.959
Caption: good old clicker fun there we go

04:21:20.000 --> 04:21:23.439

Caption: you just saw

04:21:25.599 --> 04:21:29.040
Caption: so

04:21:26.639 --> 04:21:31.679
Caption: i&#39;ll talk a little bit about me uh i&#39;m

04:21:29.040 --> 04:21:33.759
Caption: ben lowry uh lead consultant at telstra

04:21:31.679 --> 04:21:34.719
Caption: purple i&#39;ve spoken i did it a few times

04:21:33.759 --> 04:21:37.278
Caption: before

04:21:34.719 --> 04:21:39.120
Caption: you may have seen me up there

04:21:37.279 --> 04:21:41.120
Caption: or if you&#39;re in karen&#39;s talk just before

04:21:39.120 --> 04:21:42.560
Caption: this i&#39;ve featured pretty heavily on

04:21:41.120 --> 04:21:45.439
Caption: that so um

04:21:42.559 --> 04:21:46.799
Caption: you may recognize me there too

04:21:45.439 --> 04:21:48.479
Caption: uh

04:21:46.799 --> 04:21:50.318
Caption: i want to thank the other sponsors i

04:21:48.478 --> 04:21:51.679
Caption: know i think one particular volunteer i

04:21:50.319 --> 04:21:53.120
Caption: don&#39;t actually know who it was but

04:21:51.679 --> 04:21:56.158
Caption: everyone who&#39;s volunteered and all the

04:21:53.120 --> 04:21:58.399
Caption: sponsors who have gone into making today

04:21:56.159 --> 04:22:00.000
Caption: happen it&#39;s a big deal

04:21:58.399 --> 04:22:02.239
Caption: and the event doesn&#39;t happen without

04:22:00.000 --> 04:22:02.239
Caption: them

04:22:02.639 --> 04:22:08.080
Caption: cool so an offline application what is

04:22:05.120 --> 04:22:11.120
Caption: an offline application uh

04:22:08.080 --> 04:22:12.560
Caption: well it&#39;s an application that works

04:22:11.120 --> 04:22:14.000
Caption: offline

04:22:12.559 --> 04:22:15.040
Caption: that much is clear

04:22:14.000 --> 04:22:16.399
Caption: uh

04:22:15.040 --> 04:22:18.479
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk about you know why

04:22:16.399 --> 04:22:19.920
Caption: you&#39;d want to build one

04:22:18.478 --> 04:22:21.839
Caption: what benefits you get from doing it and

04:22:19.919 --> 04:22:24.000
Caption: some of the challenges

04:22:21.839 --> 04:22:27.919
Caption: that come from that

04:22:24.000 --> 04:22:29.439
Caption: in terms of how you&#39;d actually do that

04:22:27.919 --> 04:22:32.398
Caption: i&#39;m not really going to get too much

04:22:29.439 --> 04:22:34.640
Caption: into specific libraries or frameworks

04:22:32.399 --> 04:22:36.399
Caption: it&#39;s more general advice mostly because

04:22:34.639 --> 04:22:37.759
Caption: there are a bunch of people here you

04:22:36.399 --> 04:22:40.000
Caption: might all be using different tech and a

04:22:37.759 --> 04:22:41.839
Caption: lot of this stuff is transferable if it

04:22:40.000 --> 04:22:45.359
Caption: went specific it&#39;d

04:22:41.839 --> 04:22:45.358
Caption: only work for three of you i&#39;d say

04:22:45.679 --> 04:22:49.759
Caption: so why won&#39;t you want to build an

04:22:46.879 --> 04:22:51.199
Caption: offline app a big one is if you have an

04:22:49.759 --> 04:22:52.559
Caption: app that needs to be used in remote

04:22:51.199 --> 04:22:54.879
Caption: areas

04:22:52.559 --> 04:22:57.278
Caption: uh this is a map of

04:22:54.879 --> 04:22:59.679
Caption: 4g and 5g if you look for little purple

04:22:57.279 --> 04:23:03.680
Caption: bits those are 5g

04:22:59.679 --> 04:23:04.879
Caption: what coverage basically from telstra

04:23:03.679 --> 04:23:06.080
Caption: so i assume that&#39;s bigger than all the

04:23:04.879 --> 04:23:08.398
Caption: other ones but i don&#39;t know but there&#39;s

04:23:06.080 --> 04:23:10.319
Caption: still a lot of areas in australia

04:23:08.399 --> 04:23:12.159
Caption: particularly in wa where

04:23:10.319 --> 04:23:14.640
Caption: you don&#39;t get any internet

04:23:12.159 --> 04:23:16.719
Caption: so if you&#39;re working or building an app

04:23:14.639 --> 04:23:18.639
Caption: that needs to work say on a mine site or

04:23:16.719 --> 04:23:20.559
Caption: an oil rig or

04:23:18.639 --> 04:23:22.080
Caption: a remote community like maybe you&#39;re

04:23:20.559 --> 04:23:23.919
Caption: building something for water corp or

04:23:22.080 --> 04:23:25.759
Caption: something and they need to go out in the

04:23:23.919 --> 04:23:27.040
Caption: field and use it then

04:23:25.759 --> 04:23:29.120
Caption: there are a whole bunch of places where

04:23:27.040 --> 04:23:32.559
Caption: being offline but still being able to do

04:23:29.120 --> 04:23:32.560
Caption: your job is really important

04:23:33.040 --> 04:23:36.559
Caption: another one might be

04:23:34.719 --> 04:23:39.438
Caption: if you have

04:23:36.559 --> 04:23:40.959
Caption: internet outages so this graph is

04:23:39.439 --> 04:23:42.640
Caption: basically a cloudflare outage that

04:23:40.959 --> 04:23:43.759
Caption: happened in june

04:23:42.639 --> 04:23:45.839
Caption: uh

04:23:43.759 --> 04:23:47.040
Caption: basically you can see for about an hour

04:23:45.839 --> 04:23:48.080
Caption: that

04:23:47.040 --> 04:23:51.120
Caption: the international after they were

04:23:48.080 --> 04:23:53.199
Caption: serving halved now given that cloudflare

04:23:51.120 --> 04:23:54.399
Caption: serve about 20 of the internet in

04:23:53.199 --> 04:23:56.080
Caption: general

04:23:54.399 --> 04:23:57.279
Caption: that all of a sudden dropped to about

04:23:56.080 --> 04:24:00.959
Caption: 10. so

04:23:57.279 --> 04:24:03.040
Caption: 10 internet just didn&#39;t work

04:24:00.959 --> 04:24:04.478
Caption: uh if you want to be resilient to that

04:24:03.040 --> 04:24:06.879
Caption: and resilience is something we&#39;ll talk

04:24:04.478 --> 04:24:09.278
Caption: about quite a bit today if you went to

04:24:06.879 --> 04:24:11.279
Caption: derek stalking here earlier

04:24:09.279 --> 04:24:13.359
Caption: you probably uh have some useful tips

04:24:11.279 --> 04:24:16.640
Caption: already i might give you a few more or a

04:24:13.359 --> 04:24:17.439
Caption: few slightly different views of that

04:24:16.639 --> 04:24:19.120
Caption: but

04:24:17.439 --> 04:24:21.120
Caption: what the resiliency gives you is

04:24:19.120 --> 04:24:22.560
Caption: actually more than just when the whole

04:24:21.120 --> 04:24:24.560
Caption: internet goes down you also get

04:24:22.559 --> 04:24:27.278
Caption: resiliency for things like if you don&#39;t

04:24:24.559 --> 04:24:28.719
Caption: have zero downtime deployments

04:24:27.279 --> 04:24:30.239
Caption: or if you

04:24:28.719 --> 04:24:32.478
Caption: just have a bug in your code where you

04:24:30.239 --> 04:24:34.239
Caption: start returning 500 or a configuration

04:24:32.478 --> 04:24:36.079
Caption: error or something like that it means

04:24:34.239 --> 04:24:38.080
Caption: that users can keep doing their work

04:24:36.080 --> 04:24:39.439
Caption: without worrying that it&#39;s not going

04:24:38.080 --> 04:24:40.959
Caption: anywhere

04:24:39.439 --> 04:24:43.120
Caption: so you have to build the app in a way

04:24:40.959 --> 04:24:44.190
Caption: that is resilient but by doing that you

04:24:43.120 --> 04:24:46.479
Caption: get a lot of benefits

04:24:44.190 --> 04:24:47.920
Caption: [Music]

04:24:46.478 --> 04:24:50.000
Caption: the other one is just kind of

04:24:47.919 --> 04:24:52.398
Caption: situational

04:24:50.000 --> 04:24:54.159
Caption: lack of internet so if anyone got the

04:24:52.399 --> 04:24:55.840
Caption: train here this morning

04:24:54.159 --> 04:24:57.919
Caption: you may have gone through a tunnel and

04:24:55.839 --> 04:24:59.599
Caption: maybe your internet dropped out or i

04:24:57.919 --> 04:25:00.799
Caption: know for me personally most of the days

04:24:59.599 --> 04:25:02.719
Caption: i go to work

04:25:00.799 --> 04:25:04.719
Caption: as i&#39;m leaving my house

04:25:02.719 --> 04:25:06.639
Caption: i&#39;ll start scrolling through spotify or

04:25:04.719 --> 04:25:08.879
Caption: something to find something to listen to

04:25:06.639 --> 04:25:09.919
Caption: and then as i leave my house wi-fi get

04:25:08.879 --> 04:25:12.159
Caption: the

04:25:09.919 --> 04:25:14.239
Caption: you know into the world i guess the 4g

04:25:12.159 --> 04:25:15.919
Caption: or whatever then

04:25:14.239 --> 04:25:17.839
Caption: my internet cuts out and always says

04:25:15.919 --> 04:25:19.120
Caption: you&#39;re offline and it&#39;s a little bit

04:25:17.839 --> 04:25:20.879
Caption: annoying that things don&#39;t work in that

04:25:19.120 --> 04:25:23.040
Caption: period

04:25:20.879 --> 04:25:24.398
Caption: other times you know you want go for

04:25:23.040 --> 04:25:26.000
Caption: hiking or something you just find

04:25:24.399 --> 04:25:27.199
Caption: yourself in a situation where you don&#39;t

04:25:26.000 --> 04:25:28.559
Caption: have internet

04:25:27.199 --> 04:25:29.839
Caption: it&#39;s not really your fault it&#39;s only

04:25:28.559 --> 04:25:33.278
Caption: going to be for a short time but you

04:25:29.839 --> 04:25:33.279
Caption: just want to keep doing your job

04:25:33.599 --> 04:25:36.238
Caption: another reason you might want to have an

04:25:34.959 --> 04:25:37.279
Caption: offline app

04:25:36.239 --> 04:25:40.399
Caption: is

04:25:37.279 --> 04:25:41.120
Caption: for security or privacy reasons

04:25:40.399 --> 04:25:43.279
Caption: so

04:25:41.120 --> 04:25:44.719
Caption: to use an example of something that&#39;s

04:25:43.279 --> 04:25:46.959
Caption: been in the news a little bit recently

04:25:44.719 --> 04:25:48.879
Caption: and the us they

04:25:46.959 --> 04:25:50.399
Caption: changed some laws around abortions and

04:25:48.879 --> 04:25:52.159
Caption: there were recommendations going around

04:25:50.399 --> 04:25:53.760
Caption: to like delete period tracking apps and

04:25:52.159 --> 04:25:55.839
Caption: that kind of thing because the data gets

04:25:53.759 --> 04:25:57.278
Caption: stored in the cloud and you know maybe

04:25:55.839 --> 04:25:59.279
Caption: they can go and

04:25:57.279 --> 04:26:00.879
Caption: i don&#39;t know petition not position like

04:25:59.279 --> 04:26:02.560
Caption: subpoena or whatever one of those apps

04:26:00.879 --> 04:26:04.080
Caption: to get all that data

04:26:02.559 --> 04:26:06.559
Caption: find out whatever they want to find out

04:26:04.080 --> 04:26:08.479
Caption: i don&#39;t know nefarious things

04:26:06.559 --> 04:26:10.158
Caption: uh if the data never leaves the device

04:26:08.478 --> 04:26:11.519
Caption: then you don&#39;t have to worry about it so

04:26:10.159 --> 04:26:13.279
Caption: much i mean they could still get you a

04:26:11.519 --> 04:26:14.799
Caption: device but

04:26:13.279 --> 04:26:17.600
Caption: it&#39;s more a targeted attack at that

04:26:14.799 --> 04:26:20.000
Caption: point so

04:26:17.599 --> 04:26:22.080
Caption: and then the final one that i&#39;ve got

04:26:20.000 --> 04:26:23.919
Caption: here is that it&#39;s actually oftentimes a

04:26:22.080 --> 04:26:25.199
Caption: better experience for users it might be

04:26:23.919 --> 04:26:26.559
Caption: faster

04:26:25.199 --> 04:26:28.560
Caption: because you don&#39;t have to wait for it to

04:26:26.559 --> 04:26:30.000
Caption: load all the time

04:26:28.559 --> 04:26:32.079
Caption: you might use less battery or less

04:26:30.000 --> 04:26:33.919
Caption: network so in

04:26:32.080 --> 04:26:35.520
Caption: like data constrained environments

04:26:33.919 --> 04:26:37.919
Caption: particularly in you know places like

04:26:35.519 --> 04:26:40.000
Caption: africa or southeast asia or wherever

04:26:37.919 --> 04:26:42.080
Caption: where data isn&#39;t cheap

04:26:40.000 --> 04:26:44.639
Caption: that can be a benefit you know you can

04:26:42.080 --> 04:26:48.159
Caption: do things on wi-fi and then go offline

04:26:44.639 --> 04:26:48.158
Caption: when you&#39;re not in wi-fi

04:26:48.478 --> 04:26:51.278
Caption: so as an example of how much that&#39;s

04:26:50.319 --> 04:26:54.159
Caption: quicker

04:26:51.279 --> 04:26:56.159
Caption: i have a colleague who worked on a

04:26:54.159 --> 04:26:58.799
Caption: an app that has an offline mode

04:26:56.159 --> 04:27:00.399
Caption: and they have a multi-step form so at

04:26:58.799 --> 04:27:02.080
Caption: the top here we&#39;ve got the offline mode

04:27:00.399 --> 04:27:05.439
Caption: and at the bottom

04:27:02.080 --> 04:27:07.040
Caption: offline first application sorry on

04:27:05.439 --> 04:27:09.040
Caption: offline and then

04:27:07.040 --> 04:27:10.639
Caption: online

04:27:09.040 --> 04:27:14.000
Caption: so the reason that it&#39;s faster is

04:27:10.639 --> 04:27:15.839
Caption: basically because when i click next

04:27:14.000 --> 04:27:18.000
Caption: one on goes straight to the next page

04:27:15.839 --> 04:27:20.398
Caption: and the other one goes cool i&#39;ll save

04:27:18.000 --> 04:27:23.040
Caption: what you&#39;ve just done

04:27:20.399 --> 04:27:24.880
Caption: and then i&#39;ll take you to the next page

04:27:23.040 --> 04:27:26.399
Caption: so without that spinner things get a lot

04:27:24.879 --> 04:27:27.919
Caption: faster and and the example this

04:27:26.399 --> 04:27:29.600
Caption: colleague gave me was

04:27:27.919 --> 04:27:31.759
Caption: that the offline mode

04:27:29.599 --> 04:27:33.198
Caption: took about 40 seconds to fill in this

04:27:31.759 --> 04:27:34.559
Caption: whole form this multi-stage form or

04:27:33.199 --> 04:27:37.279
Caption: whatever

04:27:34.559 --> 04:27:39.839
Caption: and the online one took you know 60 or

04:27:37.279 --> 04:27:42.159
Caption: 80 seconds or something like that so you

04:27:39.839 --> 04:27:44.239
Caption: do get some benefits from having an app

04:27:42.159 --> 04:27:47.759
Caption: that works offline just because

04:27:44.239 --> 04:27:47.760
Caption: it doesn&#39;t actually do as much

04:27:49.439 --> 04:27:53.920
Caption: now every application is different and

04:27:52.000 --> 04:27:56.478
Caption: there are going to be different kinds of

04:27:53.919 --> 04:27:57.019
Caption: offline applications as well

04:27:56.478 --> 04:27:58.719
Caption: some of them

04:27:57.019 --> 04:28:00.959
Caption: [Music]

04:27:58.719 --> 04:28:02.959
Caption: might need to go online periodically

04:28:00.959 --> 04:28:04.959
Caption: some of them might kind of a fallback

04:28:02.959 --> 04:28:06.478
Caption: that works offline

04:28:04.959 --> 04:28:08.000
Caption: and then others are going to have you

04:28:06.478 --> 04:28:09.438
Caption: know kind of the full functionality

04:28:08.000 --> 04:28:10.719
Caption: offline

04:28:09.439 --> 04:28:12.960
Caption: it really does depend on what you want

04:28:10.719 --> 04:28:14.799
Caption: to build and what your kind of users

04:28:12.959 --> 04:28:16.639
Caption: needs are like

04:28:14.799 --> 04:28:18.799
Caption: spotify for example probably lets you

04:28:16.639 --> 04:28:21.278
Caption: download or your uh

04:28:18.799 --> 04:28:23.278
Caption: or your tracks to play offline

04:28:21.279 --> 04:28:25.359
Caption: but you can&#39;t use the search function to

04:28:23.279 --> 04:28:27.600
Caption: go and find more stuff for example

04:28:25.359 --> 04:28:29.919
Caption: that&#39;s a compromise they&#39;ve made and

04:28:27.599 --> 04:28:31.438
Caption: that&#39;s just what works for them

04:28:29.919 --> 04:28:33.120
Caption: so i like to think of it as layering up

04:28:31.439 --> 04:28:34.960
Caption: complexity

04:28:33.120 --> 04:28:37.439
Caption: at the base level you&#39;ve kind of got an

04:28:34.959 --> 04:28:39.438
Caption: app that&#39;s never read only those are

04:28:37.439 --> 04:28:41.040
Caption: really easy to make work offline because

04:28:39.439 --> 04:28:42.800
Caption: you just download the data and leave it

04:28:41.040 --> 04:28:44.799
Caption: there

04:28:42.799 --> 04:28:46.879
Caption: the next kind of level is when you have

04:28:44.799 --> 04:28:48.719
Caption: data that

04:28:46.879 --> 04:28:50.959
Caption: only stays on the device it never

04:28:48.719 --> 04:28:52.959
Caption: actually gets any further

04:28:50.959 --> 04:28:54.399
Caption: and those again they&#39;re pretty easy you

04:28:52.959 --> 04:28:56.478
Caption: never need to talk to the network

04:28:54.399 --> 04:28:58.640
Caption: everything&#39;s fine

04:28:56.478 --> 04:29:01.839
Caption: uh you might have some sort of caveats

04:28:58.639 --> 04:29:05.438
Caption: to those where for example they

04:29:01.839 --> 04:29:05.438
Caption: sync data to online

04:29:05.519 --> 04:29:11.278
Caption: when you choose to so you can you know

04:29:07.839 --> 04:29:11.279
Caption: export and import kind of stuff

04:29:11.359 --> 04:29:14.959
Caption: one of the reasons you might want to

04:29:12.639 --> 04:29:16.238
Caption: build one of these apps is

04:29:14.959 --> 04:29:19.040
Caption: because it&#39;s really important that the

04:29:16.239 --> 04:29:20.479
Caption: data is actually always available

04:29:19.040 --> 04:29:22.159
Caption: and it&#39;s always up to date so if you

04:29:20.478 --> 04:29:23.599
Caption: know you&#39;re not getting it from a server

04:29:22.159 --> 04:29:24.959
Caption: somewhere then

04:29:23.599 --> 04:29:26.238
Caption: what you&#39;ve got on the device is

04:29:24.959 --> 04:29:27.919
Caption: actually

04:29:26.239 --> 04:29:30.479
Caption: perfect right it&#39;s it&#39;s the source of

04:29:27.919 --> 04:29:32.799
Caption: truth that&#39;s where everything goes

04:29:30.478 --> 04:29:34.559
Caption: but just because you&#39;re not

04:29:32.799 --> 04:29:36.239
Caption: online doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have some

04:29:34.559 --> 04:29:37.519
Caption: of the same features that are online so

04:29:36.239 --> 04:29:39.359
Caption: if we imagine

04:29:37.519 --> 04:29:42.559
Caption: like a first aid app where you can

04:29:39.359 --> 04:29:45.120
Caption: download first aid articles or something

04:29:42.559 --> 04:29:48.079
Caption: then you go out into the bush and you

04:29:45.120 --> 04:29:51.040
Caption: get bit by a snake so you open up your

04:29:48.080 --> 04:29:54.080
Caption: offline first aid application and you

04:29:51.040 --> 04:29:56.399
Caption: type into the search snake bite

04:29:54.080 --> 04:29:58.319
Caption: and then it goes ah you&#39;re offline i

04:29:56.399 --> 04:30:00.640
Caption: can&#39;t return your own results that&#39;s not

04:29:58.319 --> 04:30:01.940
Caption: a great experience right so you do still

04:30:00.639 --> 04:30:04.158
Caption: need some things to work

04:30:01.940 --> 04:30:06.399
Caption: [Music]

04:30:04.159 --> 04:30:08.640
Caption: the next one is

04:30:06.399 --> 04:30:09.840
Caption: pretty classic like graceful degradation

04:30:08.639 --> 04:30:12.000
Caption: scenario

04:30:09.839 --> 04:30:15.120
Caption: you have an online app that works online

04:30:12.000 --> 04:30:16.959
Caption: everything is editable whatever and then

04:30:15.120 --> 04:30:19.839
Caption: when you go offline you lose some

04:30:16.959 --> 04:30:21.519
Caption: functionality so you can&#39;t edit anymore

04:30:19.839 --> 04:30:23.519
Caption: but you can still read all the data to

04:30:21.519 --> 04:30:25.198
Caption: help you make decisions and stuff it

04:30:23.519 --> 04:30:27.519
Caption: might be appropriate for whatever you&#39;re

04:30:25.199 --> 04:30:27.520
Caption: building

04:30:27.759 --> 04:30:31.839
Caption: like an example could be

04:30:29.519 --> 04:30:33.278
Caption: a shopping list or something

04:30:31.839 --> 04:30:34.559
Caption: where you can download a shared shopping

04:30:33.279 --> 04:30:36.239
Caption: list

04:30:34.559 --> 04:30:37.679
Caption: and see it but you can&#39;t actually make

04:30:36.239 --> 04:30:39.680
Caption: changes

04:30:37.679 --> 04:30:41.278
Caption: maybe a bad example but it&#39;s the kind of

04:30:39.679 --> 04:30:43.599
Caption: thing you could build

04:30:41.279 --> 04:30:46.319
Caption: the next level would be where

04:30:43.599 --> 04:30:47.919
Caption: some data is editable so

04:30:46.319 --> 04:30:49.359
Caption: you might only be able to create stuff

04:30:47.919 --> 04:30:51.519
Caption: but you can&#39;t edit stuff that already

04:30:49.359 --> 04:30:53.040
Caption: exists

04:30:51.519 --> 04:30:54.959
Caption: and then the last level of kind of

04:30:53.040 --> 04:30:57.439
Caption: complexity and this is what we&#39;re going

04:30:54.959 --> 04:30:59.919
Caption: to focus most on for this talk

04:30:57.439 --> 04:31:02.239
Caption: is those apps where

04:30:59.919 --> 04:31:04.000
Caption: just about everything works offline not

04:31:02.239 --> 04:31:05.680
Caption: everything everything can work offline

04:31:04.000 --> 04:31:07.599
Caption: like you can&#39;t do video streaming or

04:31:05.679 --> 04:31:09.679
Caption: live chat or anything like that

04:31:07.599 --> 04:31:11.278
Caption: but if you can do all of your job you

04:31:09.679 --> 04:31:13.519
Caption: can go around

04:31:11.279 --> 04:31:16.000
Caption: editing things and deleting things and

04:31:13.519 --> 04:31:19.119
Caption: completing tasks or whatever then that&#39;s

04:31:16.000 --> 04:31:19.120
Caption: a good step at least

04:31:19.359 --> 04:31:23.760
Caption: so broadly speaking you&#39;ve got offline

04:31:21.359 --> 04:31:26.239
Caption: only and then mixed kind of offline and

04:31:23.759 --> 04:31:29.120
Caption: online apps

04:31:26.239 --> 04:31:30.399
Caption: so i&#39;ve got an idea let&#39;s add an offline

04:31:29.120 --> 04:31:32.639
Caption: mode to our app

04:31:30.399 --> 04:31:34.640
Caption: offline mode seems easy i&#39;ve i&#39;ve sold

04:31:32.639 --> 04:31:35.919
Caption: you on all the benefits right so let&#39;s

04:31:34.639 --> 04:31:37.278
Caption: go and do it i&#39;ve already got a to-do

04:31:35.919 --> 04:31:38.639
Caption: list app

04:31:37.279 --> 04:31:39.439
Caption: how do i start

04:31:38.639 --> 04:31:41.040
Caption: well

04:31:39.439 --> 04:31:42.399
Caption: the first thing is that you have to

04:31:41.040 --> 04:31:44.319
Caption: download your data to use when you&#39;re

04:31:42.399 --> 04:31:46.959
Caption: offline

04:31:44.319 --> 04:31:49.359
Caption: so what does that actually mean

04:31:46.959 --> 04:31:51.359
Caption: downloading your data means

04:31:49.359 --> 04:31:53.359
Caption: essentially you&#39;re going to keep a local

04:31:51.359 --> 04:31:54.560
Caption: copy of that data

04:31:53.359 --> 04:31:56.399
Caption: and then

04:31:54.559 --> 04:31:57.919
Caption: anytime

04:31:56.399 --> 04:31:59.439
Caption: you use the app you just read from that

04:31:57.919 --> 04:32:02.080
Caption: local data

04:31:59.439 --> 04:32:02.080
Caption: it&#39;s pretty easy

04:32:02.879 --> 04:32:07.599
Caption: the other part of that will be that when

04:32:05.279 --> 04:32:09.600
Caption: you make changes you need to sync them

04:32:07.599 --> 04:32:11.519
Caption: back up to the server

04:32:09.599 --> 04:32:14.000
Caption: so

04:32:11.519 --> 04:32:15.679
Caption: there are a few ways you can do this

04:32:14.000 --> 04:32:18.959
Caption: a lot of smart people have gone into the

04:32:15.679 --> 04:32:21.919
Caption: effort of actually deciding what that is

04:32:18.959 --> 04:32:25.279
Caption: there&#39;s a thing called a crdt which is a

04:32:21.919 --> 04:32:27.599
Caption: conflict-free replicated data type

04:32:25.279 --> 04:32:29.199
Caption: and the idea is that

04:32:27.599 --> 04:32:30.799
Caption: every kind of local copy of your

04:32:29.199 --> 04:32:31.680
Caption: database and the wireless server is

04:32:30.799 --> 04:32:33.438
Caption: actually

04:32:31.679 --> 04:32:34.799
Caption: kind of like a distributed system and

04:32:33.439 --> 04:32:36.479
Caption: you just need to replicate changes

04:32:34.799 --> 04:32:38.000
Caption: across them so

04:32:36.478 --> 04:32:40.719
Caption: all your cloud providers and stuff will

04:32:38.000 --> 04:32:41.839
Caption: probably handle this for you in terms of

04:32:40.719 --> 04:32:44.398
Caption: like

04:32:41.839 --> 04:32:46.839
Caption: i&#39;ve got a sequel database or a

04:32:44.399 --> 04:32:48.880
Caption: table storage or dynamodb or

04:32:46.839 --> 04:32:50.959
Caption: something but the way they actually do

04:32:48.879 --> 04:32:53.759
Caption: it is using these crdts so there are

04:32:50.959 --> 04:32:54.799
Caption: three broad categories one is operation

04:32:53.759 --> 04:32:57.438
Caption: based

04:32:54.799 --> 04:32:59.599
Caption: which is essentially like having a list

04:32:57.439 --> 04:33:01.279
Caption: of

04:32:59.599 --> 04:33:05.279
Caption: operations that you&#39;ve done so you might

04:33:01.279 --> 04:33:06.160
Caption: say i&#39;ve done a create task in my to-do

04:33:05.279 --> 04:33:08.160
Caption: list

04:33:06.160 --> 04:33:09.759
Caption: and then you save that for later and

04:33:08.160 --> 04:33:11.039
Caption: when you&#39;ve come back online you process

04:33:09.759 --> 04:33:12.240
Caption: all of them and

04:33:11.039 --> 04:33:14.839
Caption: go from there

04:33:12.240 --> 04:33:17.439
Caption: another one is where you just update

04:33:14.839 --> 04:33:19.119
Caption: the the local database you&#39;ve got and

04:33:17.439 --> 04:33:20.560
Caption: then have something that

04:33:19.119 --> 04:33:22.080
Caption: basically just sends that up to the

04:33:20.560 --> 04:33:25.759
Caption: server something on the server that

04:33:22.080 --> 04:33:28.240
Caption: figures out what changed and saves it

04:33:25.759 --> 04:33:29.599
Caption: that sounds really cool

04:33:28.240 --> 04:33:30.878
Caption: and there are some tools that do it but

04:33:29.599 --> 04:33:32.480
Caption: i don&#39;t

04:33:30.878 --> 04:33:34.958
Caption: actually have much experience with those

04:33:32.480 --> 04:33:36.480
Caption: specifically

04:33:34.958 --> 04:33:38.560
Caption: and then the other one is just the

04:33:36.480 --> 04:33:41.599
Caption: saving changes so you get kind of

04:33:38.560 --> 04:33:43.359
Caption: databases that have

04:33:41.599 --> 04:33:45.039
Caption: rather than storing the state of the

04:33:43.359 --> 04:33:45.839
Caption: thing you just keep a list of changes

04:33:45.039 --> 04:33:47.199
Caption: and you

04:33:45.839 --> 04:33:49.439
Caption: and essentially send those up to the

04:33:47.199 --> 04:33:50.798
Caption: server when you come back online

04:33:49.439 --> 04:33:52.000
Caption: now the one i&#39;m going to talk most about

04:33:50.798 --> 04:33:53.839
Caption: is the queue because i feel like that&#39;s

04:33:52.000 --> 04:33:56.160
Caption: the easiest for people to reason about

04:33:53.839 --> 04:33:57.759
Caption: it&#39;s probably the like the entry level

04:33:56.160 --> 04:33:59.279
Caption: kind of offline mode

04:33:57.759 --> 04:34:00.958
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s just

04:33:59.279 --> 04:34:03.919
Caption: doing what you&#39;re already doing but

04:34:00.958 --> 04:34:03.919
Caption: saving it for later

04:34:04.400 --> 04:34:08.560
Caption: so we&#39;ll have a little bit of look at

04:34:06.400 --> 04:34:10.080
Caption: some code there&#39;s not a lot of code here

04:34:08.560 --> 04:34:11.519
Caption: um hopefully it&#39;s

04:34:10.080 --> 04:34:14.320
Caption: something you can reasonably understand

04:34:11.519 --> 04:34:16.000
Caption: even if you don&#39;t write a lot of code

04:34:14.320 --> 04:34:17.039
Caption: basically we have a to-do list and we&#39;re

04:34:16.000 --> 04:34:19.519
Caption: going to

04:34:17.039 --> 04:34:21.119
Caption: say if i&#39;m online then call the api to

04:34:19.519 --> 04:34:23.599
Caption: get the to-do

04:34:21.119 --> 04:34:26.878
Caption: otherwise get it from my offline data

04:34:23.599 --> 04:34:28.878
Caption: and then return that so

04:34:26.878 --> 04:34:31.439
Caption: it seems okay right if you&#39;re online do

04:34:28.878 --> 04:34:34.160
Caption: this if you&#39;re offline do that

04:34:31.439 --> 04:34:37.439
Caption: the same kind of approach for an update

04:34:34.160 --> 04:34:38.958
Caption: uh if we&#39;re online save that to the api

04:34:37.439 --> 04:34:42.000
Caption: if we&#39;re offline

04:34:38.958 --> 04:34:42.798
Caption: then update the local storage

04:34:42.000 --> 04:34:46.240
Caption: and

04:34:42.798 --> 04:34:46.240
Caption: queue the update essentially

04:34:46.480 --> 04:34:50.000
Caption: so we can kind of generalize that to say

04:34:48.320 --> 04:34:54.320
Caption: we&#39;ve got an app that when you&#39;re online

04:34:50.000 --> 04:34:56.320
Caption: goes from a to b it does x right

04:34:54.320 --> 04:34:58.958
Caption: if you want to talk about offline load

04:34:56.320 --> 04:35:01.439
Caption: that&#39;s saying if you&#39;re online do x if

04:34:58.958 --> 04:35:03.119
Caption: you&#39;re offline do y

04:35:01.439 --> 04:35:05.039
Caption: right it&#39;s not not impossible it&#39;s not

04:35:03.119 --> 04:35:06.240
Caption: actually not that hard

04:35:05.039 --> 04:35:09.199
Caption: but

04:35:06.240 --> 04:35:10.240
Caption: what&#39;s the problem with it

04:35:09.199 --> 04:35:12.080
Caption: well

04:35:10.240 --> 04:35:13.439
Caption: firstly having two ways of doing things

04:35:12.080 --> 04:35:16.958
Caption: means that

04:35:13.439 --> 04:35:16.958
Caption: you have to make sure both ways work

04:35:17.119 --> 04:35:21.199
Caption: you might forget to do one of them like

04:35:19.439 --> 04:35:23.599
Caption: have you worked on an app

04:35:21.199 --> 04:35:25.679
Caption: with an offline mode where someone goes

04:35:23.599 --> 04:35:27.679
Caption: uh yeah that&#39;s done

04:35:25.679 --> 04:35:29.599
Caption: i just need to make it work in offline

04:35:27.679 --> 04:35:31.359
Caption: mode

04:35:29.599 --> 04:35:33.679
Caption: or like i said how many of you have

04:35:31.359 --> 04:35:34.839
Caption: forgotten to make a particular feature

04:35:33.679 --> 04:35:37.919
Caption: work

04:35:34.839 --> 04:35:41.199
Caption: offline so

04:35:37.919 --> 04:35:41.199
Caption: there&#39;s got to be a better way

04:35:41.359 --> 04:35:45.679
Caption: and that way is to build an offline

04:35:43.839 --> 04:35:47.519
Caption: first app

04:35:45.679 --> 04:35:49.439
Caption: so rather than going from the mindset

04:35:47.519 --> 04:35:50.878
Caption: where i have an app that i want to work

04:35:49.439 --> 04:35:54.240
Caption: offline

04:35:50.878 --> 04:35:56.798
Caption: you say i&#39;ve got an offline application

04:35:54.240 --> 04:35:58.000
Caption: how do i make it work online

04:35:56.798 --> 04:35:59.679
Caption: basically you&#39;re starting from the

04:35:58.000 --> 04:36:02.000
Caption: assumption

04:35:59.679 --> 04:36:05.160
Caption: that there is no internet and working up

04:36:02.000 --> 04:36:05.160
Caption: from there

04:36:05.199 --> 04:36:11.679
Caption: now this comes with a lot of benefits

04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:13.759
Caption: [Music]

04:36:11.679 --> 04:36:15.839
Caption: like i&#39;ve already talked about

04:36:13.759 --> 04:36:17.359
Caption: the biggest one is that

04:36:15.839 --> 04:36:20.480
Caption: it&#39;s actually simpler to reason about

04:36:17.359 --> 04:36:22.400
Caption: when you&#39;ve got one way of doing things

04:36:20.480 --> 04:36:24.320
Caption: so rather than

04:36:22.400 --> 04:36:25.599
Caption: saving to the api or queueing it for

04:36:24.320 --> 04:36:27.439
Caption: later

04:36:25.599 --> 04:36:28.798
Caption: you basically just always queue up for

04:36:27.439 --> 04:36:30.400
Caption: later

04:36:28.798 --> 04:36:32.878
Caption: and then you have a background process

04:36:30.400 --> 04:36:34.878
Caption: that you know saves into the api later

04:36:32.878 --> 04:36:37.919
Caption: which you would have already had anyway

04:36:34.878 --> 04:36:37.919
Caption: to handle offline mode

04:36:42.958 --> 04:36:46.718
Caption: so

04:36:44.638 --> 04:36:49.199
Caption: probably the biggest difference

04:36:46.718 --> 04:36:51.279
Caption: between an offline first app

04:36:49.199 --> 04:36:52.480
Caption: and an offline mode app

04:36:51.279 --> 04:36:54.080
Caption: is that

04:36:52.480 --> 04:36:56.320
Caption: you&#39;re not treating being offline as an

04:36:54.080 --> 04:36:58.240
Caption: error condition it&#39;s not a special case

04:36:56.320 --> 04:37:01.240
Caption: you need to handle it&#39;s just how it

04:36:58.240 --> 04:37:01.240
Caption: works

04:37:03.519 --> 04:37:07.119
Caption: now i mentioned the term graceful

04:37:05.279 --> 04:37:09.919
Caption: degradation before that&#39;s basically

04:37:07.119 --> 04:37:11.919
Caption: saying i&#39;ve got an app that&#39;s good

04:37:09.919 --> 04:37:14.878
Caption: and when it&#39;s offline

04:37:11.919 --> 04:37:16.240
Caption: it can be almost as good

04:37:14.878 --> 04:37:18.400
Caption: the other way to look at it which is

04:37:16.240 --> 04:37:20.878
Caption: what offline thirst is is saying that

04:37:18.400 --> 04:37:22.638
Caption: it&#39;s a progressive enhancement

04:37:20.878 --> 04:37:24.080
Caption: so rather than having something that

04:37:22.638 --> 04:37:25.199
Caption: gets worse you actually have something

04:37:24.080 --> 04:37:26.240
Caption: that gets

04:37:25.199 --> 04:37:28.480
Caption: better

04:37:26.240 --> 04:37:30.240
Caption: so you build a good offline app and when

04:37:28.480 --> 04:37:31.679
Caption: it&#39;s online you enhance it with other

04:37:30.240 --> 04:37:34.480
Caption: things

04:37:31.679 --> 04:37:37.119
Caption: that might be that when you go

04:37:34.480 --> 04:37:38.878
Caption: to edit a particular item like in your

04:37:37.119 --> 04:37:41.119
Caption: to-do list you go

04:37:38.878 --> 04:37:42.638
Caption: load the to-do list from the uh from the

04:37:41.119 --> 04:37:44.560
Caption: cache

04:37:42.638 --> 04:37:48.400
Caption: and then hey i&#39;m online so i might as

04:37:44.560 --> 04:37:49.599
Caption: well go fetch it and get the new stuff

04:37:48.400 --> 04:37:51.439
Caption: so we&#39;ll go through that little bit of

04:37:49.599 --> 04:37:53.599
Caption: code again and we&#39;ll

04:37:51.439 --> 04:37:55.679
Caption: try and change it to from offline mode

04:37:53.599 --> 04:37:57.599
Caption: to offline first

04:37:55.679 --> 04:38:00.638
Caption: now i said the big problem was

04:37:57.599 --> 04:38:01.839
Caption: if this else that

04:38:00.638 --> 04:38:04.560
Caption: how about we get rid of the else and

04:38:01.839 --> 04:38:04.560
Caption: we&#39;ll see what happens

04:38:05.359 --> 04:38:09.759
Caption: it&#39;s gone easy so now we have an online

04:38:07.679 --> 04:38:11.599
Caption: app that fetches the data and then we

04:38:09.759 --> 04:38:12.878
Caption: return the offline data

04:38:11.599 --> 04:38:14.798
Caption: we&#39;ve actually missed one little bit in

04:38:12.878 --> 04:38:16.560
Caption: here so we&#39;ll make room for that and

04:38:14.798 --> 04:38:18.400
Caption: that&#39;s basically

04:38:16.560 --> 04:38:21.759
Caption: when we get the new data we have to

04:38:18.400 --> 04:38:21.759
Caption: update the offline cache as well

04:38:22.160 --> 04:38:25.279
Caption: now that&#39;s done we can target the code a

04:38:24.000 --> 04:38:27.759
Caption: little bit get rid of some variables

04:38:25.279 --> 04:38:29.919
Caption: because who likes variables

04:38:27.759 --> 04:38:31.839
Caption: and the code&#39;s you know pretty simple if

04:38:29.919 --> 04:38:35.919
Caption: you&#39;re online do this

04:38:31.839 --> 04:38:35.919
Caption: and then always return the offline data

04:38:36.080 --> 04:38:39.759
Caption: i mentioned before that waiting for

04:38:37.679 --> 04:38:42.000
Caption: things actually makes it slower

04:38:39.759 --> 04:38:43.039
Caption: so you can see these async and away

04:38:42.000 --> 04:38:45.119
Caption: words

04:38:43.039 --> 04:38:46.798
Caption: if you&#39;re not familiar async

04:38:45.119 --> 04:38:49.279
Caption: just says that you can use the await

04:38:46.798 --> 04:38:51.359
Caption: keyword and the awake keyword just

04:38:49.279 --> 04:38:53.919
Caption: actually waits for it so

04:38:51.359 --> 04:38:55.679
Caption: the program will stop and wait for that

04:38:53.919 --> 04:38:56.878
Caption: thing to respond

04:38:55.679 --> 04:38:58.480
Caption: if we just

04:38:56.878 --> 04:39:00.718
Caption: get rid of that

04:38:58.480 --> 04:39:02.000
Caption: it no longer waits for that response so

04:39:00.718 --> 04:39:05.359
Caption: we don&#39;t have that issue where it&#39;s

04:39:02.000 --> 04:39:05.359
Caption: slower because you&#39;re online

04:39:05.439 --> 04:39:08.638
Caption: now whether or not you can actually do

04:39:06.878 --> 04:39:10.000
Caption: this is going to depend on

04:39:08.638 --> 04:39:11.119
Caption: probably a framework or something that

04:39:10.000 --> 04:39:13.119
Caption: you&#39;re using

04:39:11.119 --> 04:39:15.359
Caption: in react you might write a hook that

04:39:13.119 --> 04:39:18.480
Caption: abstracts that away

04:39:15.359 --> 04:39:20.400
Caption: that&#39;s primarily what i write so

04:39:18.480 --> 04:39:23.119
Caption: i don&#39;t know all the others exactly but

04:39:20.400 --> 04:39:25.439
Caption: other reactive frameworks like swift ui

04:39:23.119 --> 04:39:26.798
Caption: or uh reactive ui

04:39:25.439 --> 04:39:28.400
Caption: or spelled

04:39:26.798 --> 04:39:29.839
Caption: i actually have similar concepts right

04:39:28.400 --> 04:39:32.839
Caption: where you can just update this behind

04:39:29.839 --> 04:39:34.958
Caption: the scenes and then show the new

04:39:32.839 --> 04:39:35.919
Caption: version we can look at our update as

04:39:34.958 --> 04:39:37.839
Caption: well

04:39:35.919 --> 04:39:39.359
Caption: and we go

04:39:37.839 --> 04:39:42.240
Caption: now we&#39;ve got that if else but we&#39;ll

04:39:39.359 --> 04:39:43.599
Caption: tackle it slightly differently

04:39:42.240 --> 04:39:45.599
Caption: instead of

04:39:43.599 --> 04:39:46.796
Caption: relying on updating this thing as it&#39;s

04:39:45.599 --> 04:39:49.119
Caption: happening

04:39:46.798 --> 04:39:51.201
Caption: we&#39;ve already built a robust solution to

04:39:49.119 --> 04:39:52.636
Caption: handle those background updates and the

04:39:51.199 --> 04:39:55.439
Caption: robustness of that is very important

04:39:52.638 --> 04:39:57.281
Caption: we&#39;ll talk more about that later

04:39:55.439 --> 04:39:59.919
Caption: so why not just use that we can get rid

04:39:57.279 --> 04:40:01.359
Caption: of this whole section entirely

04:39:59.919 --> 04:40:04.320
Caption: and we&#39;re left with something pretty

04:40:01.359 --> 04:40:05.919
Caption: simple right we update the offline data

04:40:04.320 --> 04:40:08.240
Caption: and then we schedule the update for

04:40:05.919 --> 04:40:08.240
Caption: later

04:40:09.359 --> 04:40:13.759
Caption: this idea of updating the offline data

04:40:11.679 --> 04:40:16.400
Caption: is actually really interesting

04:40:13.759 --> 04:40:18.796
Caption: has anyone heard of optimistic ui or

04:40:16.400 --> 04:40:21.121
Caption: optimistic updates

04:40:18.798 --> 04:40:22.878
Caption: a couple of people so that&#39;s the idea

04:40:21.119 --> 04:40:24.478
Caption: basically that

04:40:22.878 --> 04:40:27.601
Caption: because it feels slow to wait all the

04:40:24.480 --> 04:40:31.041
Caption: time let&#39;s just update this thing with

04:40:27.599 --> 04:40:33.439
Caption: the expectation that it works

04:40:31.039 --> 04:40:35.279
Caption: now that is something that happens in

04:40:33.439 --> 04:40:36.957
Caption: online apps as well it&#39;s kind of

04:40:35.279 --> 04:40:38.318
Caption: essentially an offline app because

04:40:36.957 --> 04:40:39.359
Caption: otherwise you&#39;re always looking at old

04:40:38.320 --> 04:40:41.359
Caption: data

04:40:39.359 --> 04:40:42.716
Caption: but online apps do this as well to try

04:40:41.359 --> 04:40:45.199
Caption: and feel

04:40:42.718 --> 04:40:46.400
Caption: faster they basically want that offline

04:40:45.199 --> 04:40:49.679
Caption: experience

04:40:46.400 --> 04:40:52.160
Caption: where things just work you know so that

04:40:49.679 --> 04:40:54.080
Caption: there are lots of tools now to go and do

04:40:52.160 --> 04:40:56.718
Caption: those optimistic updates uh they get

04:40:54.080 --> 04:40:58.958
Caption: built into query libraries like apollo

04:40:56.718 --> 04:40:59.919
Caption: client or route query or things like

04:40:58.957 --> 04:41:01.839
Caption: that

04:40:59.919 --> 04:41:04.560
Caption: again i mainly work in react so those

04:41:01.839 --> 04:41:04.560
Caption: are my examples

04:41:05.759 --> 04:41:10.400
Caption: so i painted a pretty rosy picture about

04:41:08.878 --> 04:41:13.041
Caption: you know how easy it is to make an

04:41:10.400 --> 04:41:15.439
Caption: offline app and there are a bunch of

04:41:13.039 --> 04:41:17.599
Caption: challenges

04:41:15.439 --> 04:41:18.796
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk about them a fair

04:41:17.599 --> 04:41:21.679
Caption: bit

04:41:18.798 --> 04:41:21.681
Caption: after i&#39;ve had a drink

04:41:24.638 --> 04:41:28.798
Caption: so when you talk about offline apps one

04:41:26.718 --> 04:41:30.160
Caption: of the big ones that big challenges that

04:41:28.798 --> 04:41:32.000
Caption: people will raise

04:41:30.160 --> 04:41:33.679
Caption: is the idea of getting a merge conflict

04:41:32.000 --> 04:41:36.080
Caption: now developers are pretty familiar with

04:41:33.679 --> 04:41:38.480
Caption: merge conflicts because we get them

04:41:36.080 --> 04:41:39.359
Caption: all the time when we&#39;re writing code

04:41:38.480 --> 04:41:41.041
Caption: and

04:41:39.359 --> 04:41:44.000
Caption: you won&#39;t find many people in the room

04:41:41.039 --> 04:41:44.876
Caption: who actually enjoy that process

04:41:44.000 --> 04:41:47.119
Caption: but

04:41:44.878 --> 04:41:49.761
Caption: it&#39;s not necessarily as big a deal as

04:41:47.119 --> 04:41:51.599
Caption: people think it is with an offline app

04:41:49.759 --> 04:41:52.796
Caption: so i&#39;ll just run through a little bit of

04:41:51.599 --> 04:41:55.439
Caption: what a most conflict is because it&#39;s a

04:41:52.798 --> 04:41:57.361
Caption: complicated idea if you&#39;re not familiar

04:41:55.439 --> 04:41:59.199
Caption: basically emerge conflict happens when

04:41:57.359 --> 04:42:01.599
Caption: two people change the same thing around

04:41:59.199 --> 04:42:02.398
Caption: the same time

04:42:01.599 --> 04:42:04.636
Caption: so

04:42:02.400 --> 04:42:08.240
Caption: in this case we&#39;ve got alice and bob

04:42:04.638 --> 04:42:10.718
Caption: alice opens a thing saves our changes

04:42:08.240 --> 04:42:13.279
Caption: and in that in between phase

04:42:10.718 --> 04:42:15.281
Caption: bob has also opened the thing and he

04:42:13.279 --> 04:42:16.478
Caption: saved some changes

04:42:15.279 --> 04:42:18.398
Caption: now when you get to the end if they&#39;ve

04:42:16.480 --> 04:42:20.000
Caption: made different changes

04:42:18.400 --> 04:42:23.281
Caption: you need to figure out

04:42:20.000 --> 04:42:25.279
Caption: what to do essentially so there&#39;s a kind

04:42:23.279 --> 04:42:27.199
Caption: of an important line we can draw in the

04:42:25.279 --> 04:42:29.599
Caption: sand which is

04:42:27.199 --> 04:42:31.039
Caption: when that first person saves it

04:42:29.599 --> 04:42:33.519
Caption: the person who goes after that will get

04:42:31.039 --> 04:42:33.519
Caption: a problem

04:42:33.679 --> 04:42:37.439
Caption: now i&#39;ve got the lines

04:42:35.359 --> 04:42:40.320
Caption: roughly in this kind of range but really

04:42:37.439 --> 04:42:40.320
Caption: they can be anywhere

04:42:40.798 --> 04:42:45.521
Caption: essentially if you open it before

04:42:43.279 --> 04:42:46.957
Caption: that dotted blue line and you save it

04:42:45.519 --> 04:42:48.480
Caption: after that dotted blue line then you

04:42:46.957 --> 04:42:49.519
Caption: have a problem if you open it and save

04:42:48.480 --> 04:42:51.361
Caption: it before

04:42:49.519 --> 04:42:53.039
Caption: the other person gets the problem

04:42:51.359 --> 04:42:55.519
Caption: if you open it after then you&#39;re already

04:42:53.039 --> 04:42:56.558
Caption: getting the latest updates anyway so

04:42:55.519 --> 04:42:58.480
Caption: you&#39;re not going to get that merge

04:42:56.560 --> 04:43:00.958
Caption: conflict scenario

04:42:58.480 --> 04:43:02.878
Caption: the thing is for an offline app

04:43:00.957 --> 04:43:04.558
Caption: it&#39;s not so much about when you open it

04:43:02.878 --> 04:43:07.441
Caption: and when you save it

04:43:04.560 --> 04:43:10.080
Caption: it&#39;s more like when you were last online

04:43:07.439 --> 04:43:11.759
Caption: to get the version at the beginning

04:43:10.080 --> 04:43:13.041
Caption: and then when you come back online at

04:43:11.759 --> 04:43:15.199
Caption: the end

04:43:13.039 --> 04:43:16.716
Caption: so the time frame for actually getting a

04:43:15.199 --> 04:43:19.359
Caption: merge conflict when you have an offline

04:43:16.718 --> 04:43:21.681
Caption: app it&#39;s quite a lot bigger

04:43:19.359 --> 04:43:22.558
Caption: but the problem is existing no matter

04:43:21.679 --> 04:43:23.679
Caption: what

04:43:22.560 --> 04:43:25.679
Caption: you know

04:43:23.679 --> 04:43:28.000
Caption: even if it you&#39;ve got a thing that takes

04:43:25.679 --> 04:43:29.599
Caption: 10 seconds to fill out that&#39;s still a 10

04:43:28.000 --> 04:43:30.480
Caption: second window where someone might open

04:43:29.599 --> 04:43:32.400
Caption: it

04:43:30.480 --> 04:43:34.000
Caption: and hit this problem so

04:43:32.400 --> 04:43:35.201
Caption: you already do something about merge

04:43:34.000 --> 04:43:36.638
Caption: conflicts

04:43:35.199 --> 04:43:37.759
Caption: you probably just haven&#39;t thought about

04:43:36.638 --> 04:43:39.521
Caption: it

04:43:37.759 --> 04:43:40.876
Caption: uh common things that you might find

04:43:39.519 --> 04:43:42.558
Caption: there would be that

04:43:40.878 --> 04:43:44.560
Caption: the last update wins

04:43:42.560 --> 04:43:46.160
Caption: because they made the change last so

04:43:44.560 --> 04:43:48.320
Caption: just overwrite whatever was in there

04:43:46.160 --> 04:43:49.439
Caption: with what they put

04:43:48.320 --> 04:43:51.839
Caption: hopefully

04:43:49.439 --> 04:43:53.759
Caption: uh some of the changes will be the same

04:43:51.839 --> 04:43:55.839
Caption: so it actually doesn&#39;t matter if that if

04:43:53.759 --> 04:43:56.957
Caption: that happened or not

04:43:55.839 --> 04:43:59.599
Caption: but there are other approaches you can

04:43:56.957 --> 04:44:00.796
Caption: use where rather than say hey here&#39;s

04:43:59.599 --> 04:44:02.160
Caption: this whole

04:44:00.798 --> 04:44:04.400
Caption: thing you know here&#39;s a title and

04:44:02.160 --> 04:44:07.121
Caption: description and some tags

04:44:04.400 --> 04:44:07.121
Caption: on how to do

04:44:07.279 --> 04:44:10.716
Caption: go and replace whatever was there you

04:44:08.957 --> 04:44:12.478
Caption: could actually just say all right you

04:44:10.718 --> 04:44:14.878
Caption: changed the description

04:44:12.480 --> 04:44:16.400
Caption: so let&#39;s update the description

04:44:14.878 --> 04:44:17.921
Caption: and that limits the amount of merge

04:44:16.400 --> 04:44:19.361
Caption: conflicts you&#39;ll get

04:44:17.919 --> 04:44:21.599
Caption: and the idea behind that&#39;s kind of like

04:44:19.359 --> 04:44:24.957
Caption: a a patch operation

04:44:21.599 --> 04:44:27.759
Caption: um it&#39;s a http patch keyword and a rfc

04:44:24.957 --> 04:44:30.000
Caption: and all this fun stuff around that

04:44:27.759 --> 04:44:31.359
Caption: but basically most conflicts are a

04:44:30.000 --> 04:44:34.240
Caption: problem and you do need to think about

04:44:31.359 --> 04:44:36.080
Caption: them but they&#39;re already a problem so

04:44:34.240 --> 04:44:39.759
Caption: going offline doesn&#39;t really change it

04:44:36.080 --> 04:44:39.759
Caption: except that you might hit it more

04:44:41.039 --> 04:44:43.759
Caption: another one is

04:44:42.798 --> 04:44:45.441
Caption: api

04:44:43.759 --> 04:44:47.359
Caption: versioning and backwards compatibility

04:44:45.439 --> 04:44:51.279
Caption: and those kind of concerns

04:44:47.359 --> 04:44:53.759
Caption: because you may have had an app that was

04:44:51.279 --> 04:44:55.919
Caption: you know last online

04:44:53.759 --> 04:44:57.839
Caption: three weeks ago if you&#39;ve changed the

04:44:55.919 --> 04:45:00.240
Caption: api in that three week period

04:44:57.839 --> 04:45:02.240
Caption: and done a breaking change then

04:45:00.240 --> 04:45:04.000
Caption: anyone who comes back online from three

04:45:02.240 --> 04:45:05.279
Caption: weeks ago

04:45:04.000 --> 04:45:06.957
Caption: you know the things they&#39;re trying to do

04:45:05.279 --> 04:45:08.558
Caption: won&#39;t work because

04:45:06.957 --> 04:45:10.398
Caption: there might be missing required fields

04:45:08.560 --> 04:45:14.000
Caption: or that kind of thing right

04:45:10.400 --> 04:45:15.839
Caption: so it becomes more important that you

04:45:14.000 --> 04:45:18.080
Caption: accept um

04:45:15.839 --> 04:45:20.080
Caption: backwards compatible like old versions

04:45:18.080 --> 04:45:21.519
Caption: of stuff so i don&#39;t know you add a new

04:45:20.080 --> 04:45:23.759
Caption: field to your

04:45:21.519 --> 04:45:24.876
Caption: to-do that&#39;s called assignee or

04:45:23.759 --> 04:45:27.199
Caption: something

04:45:24.878 --> 04:45:29.601
Caption: and then if you make it a required field

04:45:27.199 --> 04:45:31.519
Caption: anyone who doesn&#39;t provide messiani

04:45:29.599 --> 04:45:32.796
Caption: it&#39;ll fail that&#39;s kind of a problem

04:45:31.519 --> 04:45:34.320
Caption: right so you still need a way for

04:45:32.798 --> 04:45:37.121
Caption: someone to do

04:45:34.320 --> 04:45:38.798
Caption: their job without that field and a

04:45:37.119 --> 04:45:40.318
Caption: common approach to that is having api

04:45:38.798 --> 04:45:42.320
Caption: versioning there are a bunch of other

04:45:40.320 --> 04:45:44.160
Caption: ways as well but

04:45:42.320 --> 04:45:47.759
Caption: again that&#39;s going to depend on what you

04:45:44.160 --> 04:45:47.759
Caption: uh how your app works

04:45:47.919 --> 04:45:50.798
Caption: you&#39;ll notice a common theme around

04:45:49.359 --> 04:45:52.957
Caption: these that they&#39;re all related to

04:45:50.798 --> 04:45:54.240
Caption: handling errors because when everything

04:45:52.957 --> 04:45:56.478
Caption: works

04:45:54.240 --> 04:45:59.279
Caption: everything works and everything&#39;s easy

04:45:56.480 --> 04:46:00.718
Caption: the problem is when there are problems

04:45:59.279 --> 04:46:02.318
Caption: so another one is things like field

04:46:00.718 --> 04:46:03.521
Caption: validation you know

04:46:02.320 --> 04:46:06.480
Caption: if you have

04:46:03.519 --> 04:46:08.160
Caption: a required field that you&#39;ve added

04:46:06.480 --> 04:46:09.361
Caption: whether it existed before or exists

04:46:08.160 --> 04:46:11.041
Caption: later

04:46:09.359 --> 04:46:14.716
Caption: essentially

04:46:11.039 --> 04:46:17.359
Caption: if you rely on the server to validate

04:46:14.718 --> 04:46:19.121
Caption: these requests that you&#39;re making

04:46:17.359 --> 04:46:21.359
Caption: before like rather than letting the

04:46:19.119 --> 04:46:24.398
Caption: client do it that means your offline

04:46:21.359 --> 04:46:26.478
Caption: user has to wait potentially weeks until

04:46:24.400 --> 04:46:28.798
Caption: they actually try and do the thing

04:46:26.480 --> 04:46:30.080
Caption: and then it fails so that&#39;s a problem

04:46:28.798 --> 04:46:32.320
Caption: because

04:46:30.080 --> 04:46:34.878
Caption: to go and add a required field

04:46:32.320 --> 04:46:36.240
Caption: when you press submit is

04:46:34.878 --> 04:46:38.958
Caption: pretty easy right

04:46:36.240 --> 04:46:41.359
Caption: but if you&#39;re revisiting it weeks days

04:46:38.957 --> 04:46:43.359
Caption: hours even later

04:46:41.359 --> 04:46:45.919
Caption: it&#39;s a lot harder to to know what the

04:46:43.359 --> 04:46:49.039
Caption: right thing to put in is the

04:46:45.919 --> 04:46:51.519
Caption: put in there is

04:46:49.039 --> 04:46:53.919
Caption: so i talked about the um

04:46:51.519 --> 04:46:56.320
Caption: the offline queue or the queue of

04:46:53.919 --> 04:46:59.199
Caption: changes to make so we&#39;ve got a little

04:46:56.320 --> 04:47:00.878
Caption: animation thing that i&#39;m pretty proud of

04:46:59.199 --> 04:47:03.599
Caption: that i made here basically showing that

04:47:00.878 --> 04:47:05.841
Caption: process so this little box is going to

04:47:03.599 --> 04:47:07.199
Caption: be our magical processor and all the

04:47:05.839 --> 04:47:08.638
Caption: little

04:47:07.199 --> 04:47:10.000
Caption: rectangles

04:47:08.638 --> 04:47:12.160
Caption: uh other things we&#39;re going to do with

04:47:10.000 --> 04:47:15.199
Caption: them so we start by pressing one and we

04:47:12.160 --> 04:47:18.718
Caption: take the next one process that

04:47:15.199 --> 04:47:20.558
Caption: take the next one and it&#39;s failed

04:47:18.718 --> 04:47:22.400
Caption: so

04:47:20.560 --> 04:47:24.718
Caption: if you went to derek&#39;s talk earlier he

04:47:22.400 --> 04:47:26.878
Caption: talked a lot about you know retries and

04:47:24.718 --> 04:47:28.160
Caption: timeouts and exponential back off and

04:47:26.878 --> 04:47:30.320
Caption: those kind of things

04:47:28.160 --> 04:47:32.320
Caption: and yeah you probably do want to retry

04:47:30.320 --> 04:47:34.798
Caption: these requests because they might just

04:47:32.320 --> 04:47:37.599
Caption: be intermittent errors

04:47:34.798 --> 04:47:40.798
Caption: if they&#39;re not intermittent errors then

04:47:37.599 --> 04:47:42.080
Caption: you retry it and it will always fail so

04:47:40.798 --> 04:47:44.480
Caption: what do you do

04:47:42.080 --> 04:47:46.080
Caption: if you talk about a queue then there&#39;s

04:47:44.480 --> 04:47:48.000
Caption: this idea that you process them in the

04:47:46.080 --> 04:47:49.359
Caption: order they came in but this one is now

04:47:48.000 --> 04:47:52.000
Caption: stuck

04:47:49.359 --> 04:47:54.876
Caption: so you need something to essentially

04:47:52.000 --> 04:47:54.878
Caption: put that aside

04:47:57.759 --> 04:48:00.480
Caption: and then

04:47:59.119 --> 04:48:01.759
Caption: you can continue processing the rest of

04:48:00.480 --> 04:48:03.519
Caption: them

04:48:01.759 --> 04:48:05.679
Caption: now you&#39;re not done yet

04:48:03.519 --> 04:48:06.439
Caption: that one that you didn&#39;t process

04:48:05.679 --> 04:48:08.636
Caption: is still

04:48:06.439 --> 04:48:10.000
Caption: [Music]

04:48:08.638 --> 04:48:11.759
Caption: valid it&#39;s still something that someone

04:48:10.000 --> 04:48:16.000
Caption: tried to do and it didn&#39;t work so you

04:48:11.759 --> 04:48:16.000
Caption: need a way for them to resume that

04:48:16.480 --> 04:48:19.599
Caption: it&#39;ll depend on again what the app is

04:48:18.878 --> 04:48:22.080
Caption: and

04:48:19.599 --> 04:48:23.679
Caption: what you expect it to do

04:48:22.080 --> 04:48:25.599
Caption: but

04:48:23.679 --> 04:48:27.279
Caption: basically we need to try and reprocess

04:48:25.599 --> 04:48:28.957
Caption: it again in a different way so that

04:48:27.279 --> 04:48:31.199
Caption: might be saying you can go back in and

04:48:28.957 --> 04:48:32.957
Caption: edit and try again

04:48:31.199 --> 04:48:34.957
Caption: or you

04:48:32.957 --> 04:48:37.039
Caption: save it to some api and get an admin

04:48:34.957 --> 04:48:39.119
Caption: team to process them

04:48:37.039 --> 04:48:42.558
Caption: or you just roll it back and say hey

04:48:39.119 --> 04:48:46.000
Caption: sorry we couldn&#39;t do that throw it away

04:48:42.560 --> 04:48:46.798
Caption: again depends on what your data is

04:48:46.000 --> 04:48:48.638
Caption: but

04:48:46.798 --> 04:48:51.681
Caption: the kind of robustness of this process

04:48:48.638 --> 04:48:53.601
Caption: is is really important because

04:48:51.679 --> 04:48:56.957
Caption: it&#39;s called your app now so whereas

04:48:53.599 --> 04:48:57.839
Caption: before in offline mode it may have been

04:48:56.957 --> 04:48:59.519
Caption: there

04:48:57.839 --> 04:49:01.199
Caption: and you didn&#39;t spend all of your effort

04:48:59.519 --> 04:49:02.957
Caption: building it

04:49:01.199 --> 04:49:05.119
Caption: you know maybe you get some problems and

04:49:02.957 --> 04:49:06.876
Caption: and it&#39;s sort of okay because when

04:49:05.119 --> 04:49:08.957
Caption: they&#39;re online it works

04:49:06.878 --> 04:49:10.878
Caption: but for an offline first app this is the

04:49:08.957 --> 04:49:12.238
Caption: only way you get those updates happening

04:49:10.878 --> 04:49:14.080
Caption: so

04:49:12.240 --> 04:49:16.878
Caption: again make it robust

04:49:14.080 --> 04:49:19.759
Caption: uh you need to think about things like

04:49:16.878 --> 04:49:22.080
Caption: having an item potency on your requests

04:49:19.759 --> 04:49:23.759
Caption: for example if this was a delete that

04:49:22.080 --> 04:49:25.759
Caption: failed because

04:49:23.759 --> 04:49:27.679
Caption: the thing was already deleted you could

04:49:25.759 --> 04:49:30.240
Caption: go well you&#39;re trying to delete it and

04:49:27.679 --> 04:49:33.119
Caption: it&#39;s deleted so it&#39;s fine and just mark

04:49:30.240 --> 04:49:35.121
Caption: it as successful basically

04:49:33.119 --> 04:49:36.876
Caption: and you might also have the

04:49:35.119 --> 04:49:38.398
Caption: dependent requests in here so let&#39;s say

04:49:36.878 --> 04:49:40.240
Caption: this was a create

04:49:38.400 --> 04:49:42.638
Caption: and then later i had an update that

04:49:40.240 --> 04:49:45.279
Caption: update would also fail because it&#39;s got

04:49:42.638 --> 04:49:46.878
Caption: nothing to update now so

04:49:45.279 --> 04:49:50.359
Caption: they might you might finally get a few

04:49:46.878 --> 04:49:50.361
Caption: of these things happening

04:49:50.480 --> 04:49:54.240
Caption: uh another problem is when you have a

04:49:52.798 --> 04:49:56.958
Caption: patchy internet connection or an

04:49:54.240 --> 04:49:59.041
Caption: unreliable connection rather than

04:49:56.957 --> 04:50:02.000
Caption: being just offline

04:49:59.039 --> 04:50:04.558
Caption: that&#39;s actually kind of worse

04:50:02.000 --> 04:50:05.839
Caption: you could look at the things like

04:50:04.560 --> 04:50:07.041
Caption: on your device they often have

04:50:05.839 --> 04:50:08.638
Caption: indicators that say whether you&#39;re

04:50:07.039 --> 04:50:11.039
Caption: online or offline

04:50:08.638 --> 04:50:12.638
Caption: but how reliable are they actually

04:50:11.039 --> 04:50:15.199
Caption: uh you might want to put in something

04:50:12.638 --> 04:50:17.441
Caption: like a health check endpoint on your api

04:50:15.199 --> 04:50:19.679
Caption: where you can call that to see

04:50:17.439 --> 04:50:21.839
Caption: like the device says i&#39;m online but can

04:50:19.679 --> 04:50:23.199
Caption: i actually call the apis that i need to

04:50:21.839 --> 04:50:25.279
Caption: call

04:50:23.199 --> 04:50:27.839
Caption: and then you know base it on that

04:50:25.279 --> 04:50:28.796
Caption: you might want to consider

04:50:27.839 --> 04:50:31.599
Caption: having

04:50:28.798 --> 04:50:33.201
Caption: the app like manually try and sync up

04:50:31.599 --> 04:50:36.240
Caption: rather than doing it automatically so

04:50:33.199 --> 04:50:37.679
Caption: the user can say yeah i want to sync now

04:50:36.240 --> 04:50:40.160
Caption: again that doesn&#39;t work for everyone but

04:50:37.679 --> 04:50:42.160
Caption: it&#39;s an approach that you could take

04:50:40.160 --> 04:50:43.599
Caption: to handle this problem so

04:50:42.160 --> 04:50:45.519
Caption: rather than just

04:50:43.599 --> 04:50:46.957
Caption: responding to being online you can wait

04:50:45.519 --> 04:50:48.716
Caption: until the person

04:50:46.957 --> 04:50:50.957
Caption: is like yeah i&#39;m back in the office now

04:50:48.718 --> 04:50:54.000
Caption: so i can

04:50:50.957 --> 04:50:54.000
Caption: do this thing and it should work

04:50:58.160 --> 04:51:00.798
Caption: another thing is when you have an

04:50:59.599 --> 04:51:03.679
Caption: offline app

04:51:00.798 --> 04:51:06.160
Caption: you probably need to tell your users

04:51:03.679 --> 04:51:07.279
Caption: that it&#39;s offline and

04:51:06.160 --> 04:51:09.041
Caption: uh

04:51:07.279 --> 04:51:10.716
Caption: you could say something like you&#39;re

04:51:09.039 --> 04:51:11.839
Caption: offline

04:51:10.718 --> 04:51:13.281
Caption: but do they know what that actually

04:51:11.839 --> 04:51:15.039
Caption: means so

04:51:13.279 --> 04:51:16.080
Caption: rather than just say you&#39;re offline you

04:51:15.039 --> 04:51:17.919
Caption: might want to

04:51:16.080 --> 04:51:18.798
Caption: change it up a little and say something

04:51:17.919 --> 04:51:20.957
Caption: like

04:51:18.798 --> 04:51:22.718
Caption: you&#39;re offline changes will be saved

04:51:20.957 --> 04:51:24.716
Caption: when you&#39;re back online

04:51:22.718 --> 04:51:26.638
Caption: that kind of hints that

04:51:24.718 --> 04:51:28.240
Caption: oh i&#39;m not done just because i think i&#39;m

04:51:26.638 --> 04:51:30.560
Caption: done

04:51:28.240 --> 04:51:32.560
Caption: there&#39;s something else i&#39;ll need to do

04:51:30.560 --> 04:51:34.638
Caption: again you talk to whoever about the

04:51:32.560 --> 04:51:36.718
Caption: exact wording there but

04:51:34.638 --> 04:51:38.320
Caption: there&#39;s that kind of idea where

04:51:36.718 --> 04:51:41.601
Caption: telling them what the state is doesn&#39;t

04:51:38.320 --> 04:51:43.599
Caption: help tell them what they can do about it

04:51:41.599 --> 04:51:45.599
Caption: and then as you go through you might say

04:51:43.599 --> 04:51:47.119
Caption: we&#39;ve got three changes pending upload

04:51:45.599 --> 04:51:49.199
Caption: or uh

04:51:47.119 --> 04:51:50.398
Caption: we&#39;ve uploaded five of eight of your

04:51:49.199 --> 04:51:52.558
Caption: changes

04:51:50.400 --> 04:51:53.599
Caption: or you know all changes are saved at the

04:51:52.560 --> 04:51:56.240
Caption: end

04:51:53.599 --> 04:51:58.636
Caption: just to help the users understand that

04:51:56.240 --> 04:52:00.638
Caption: yes you&#39;re offline

04:51:58.638 --> 04:52:02.958
Caption: and what does it mean

04:52:00.638 --> 04:52:04.480
Caption: for you now you know are you done yet

04:52:02.957 --> 04:52:06.796
Caption: when you get this kind of message it&#39;s

04:52:04.480 --> 04:52:08.958
Caption: like oh cool everything i&#39;ve saved

04:52:06.798 --> 04:52:11.441
Caption: everything i&#39;ve changed has been saved

04:52:08.957 --> 04:52:13.759
Caption: so i can go about my day everything&#39;s

04:52:11.439 --> 04:52:13.759
Caption: normal

04:52:14.080 --> 04:52:18.638
Caption: another one that will be affected by

04:52:16.400 --> 04:52:20.400
Caption: having an offline app

04:52:18.638 --> 04:52:22.400
Caption: is that

04:52:20.400 --> 04:52:25.599
Caption: the security posture

04:52:22.400 --> 04:52:26.718
Caption: of your app changes

04:52:25.599 --> 04:52:28.400
Caption: um

04:52:26.718 --> 04:52:31.361
Caption: because you&#39;re getting all this data

04:52:28.400 --> 04:52:31.361
Caption: onto your device

04:52:31.439 --> 04:52:35.119
Caption: it&#39;s potential that someone else could

04:52:33.119 --> 04:52:36.558
Caption: get that data off the device

04:52:35.119 --> 04:52:38.478
Caption: so you might want to think about things

04:52:36.560 --> 04:52:40.320
Caption: like encryption

04:52:38.480 --> 04:52:42.400
Caption: uh if that&#39;s important

04:52:40.320 --> 04:52:45.041
Caption: if you do have encryption then

04:52:42.400 --> 04:52:47.599
Caption: where do you store the encryption keys

04:52:45.039 --> 04:52:49.279
Caption: uh if they&#39;re also on the device then

04:52:47.599 --> 04:52:51.759
Caption: it might be a little

04:52:49.279 --> 04:52:54.318
Caption: i don&#39;t know pointless to have the keys

04:52:51.759 --> 04:52:56.240
Caption: stored with the data

04:52:54.320 --> 04:52:58.718
Caption: so you think about how that&#39;s going to

04:52:56.240 --> 04:53:02.400
Caption: work for you another big one is

04:52:58.718 --> 04:53:04.560
Caption: if you have shared devices

04:53:02.400 --> 04:53:06.718
Caption: let&#39;s say yeah in a workplace it might

04:53:04.560 --> 04:53:08.958
Caption: be there&#39;s a kiosk thing that people use

04:53:06.718 --> 04:53:10.638
Caption: to do a job

04:53:08.957 --> 04:53:11.919
Caption: and when someone shift ends they hand it

04:53:10.638 --> 04:53:13.361
Caption: over to someone else and they&#39;ll go do

04:53:11.919 --> 04:53:14.480
Caption: their job too

04:53:13.359 --> 04:53:16.160
Caption: so if there&#39;s

04:53:14.480 --> 04:53:18.000
Caption: kind of user data on there you might

04:53:16.160 --> 04:53:19.359
Caption: need to think about

04:53:18.000 --> 04:53:21.839
Caption: keeping it separate from the other

04:53:19.359 --> 04:53:21.839
Caption: user&#39;s data

04:53:23.439 --> 04:53:26.320
Caption: it&#39;s going to depend right maybe it&#39;s

04:53:24.957 --> 04:53:27.919
Caption: fine for them to see it maybe it&#39;s not

04:53:26.320 --> 04:53:29.201
Caption: really user sensitive but if you&#39;re

04:53:27.919 --> 04:53:30.876
Caption: storing

04:53:29.199 --> 04:53:32.876
Caption: you know their name or date of birth or

04:53:30.878 --> 04:53:34.718
Caption: something somewhere

04:53:32.878 --> 04:53:36.718
Caption: then i don&#39;t know you might want to hide

04:53:34.718 --> 04:53:38.240
Caption: it as well so that&#39;s where encryption

04:53:36.718 --> 04:53:40.080
Caption: would come in and

04:53:38.240 --> 04:53:41.519
Caption: all the other fun things

04:53:40.080 --> 04:53:43.839
Caption: and then another

04:53:41.519 --> 04:53:46.240
Caption: kind of complicated issue is that most

04:53:43.839 --> 04:53:48.080
Caption: of the apps that we build especially if

04:53:46.240 --> 04:53:50.160
Caption: you&#39;re going for you know enterprise

04:53:48.080 --> 04:53:52.240
Caption: kind of clients or whatever

04:53:50.160 --> 04:53:55.121
Caption: you&#39;ll need some kind of authorization

04:53:52.240 --> 04:53:56.400
Caption: and authentication some like login

04:53:55.119 --> 04:53:58.080
Caption: stuff

04:53:56.400 --> 04:54:00.320
Caption: now when you&#39;re

04:53:58.080 --> 04:54:02.798
Caption: online you can log in and get refresh

04:54:00.320 --> 04:54:04.798
Caption: tokens and you know have a token

04:54:02.798 --> 04:54:06.320
Caption: lifetime that lasts an hour

04:54:04.798 --> 04:54:08.560
Caption: and then you go

04:54:06.320 --> 04:54:11.679
Caption: and get a refreshed version every hour

04:54:08.560 --> 04:54:13.919
Caption: so that you don&#39;t never run out right

04:54:11.679 --> 04:54:15.599
Caption: if you&#39;re offline you can&#39;t do that

04:54:13.919 --> 04:54:16.876
Caption: anymore so

04:54:15.599 --> 04:54:19.119
Caption: you might need to think about how you

04:54:16.878 --> 04:54:20.638
Caption: need to relax those those rules all

04:54:19.119 --> 04:54:23.279
Caption: those guidelines

04:54:20.638 --> 04:54:25.041
Caption: just to handle that scenario so

04:54:23.279 --> 04:54:26.796
Caption: you might let people in if their token

04:54:25.039 --> 04:54:28.478
Caption: has expired

04:54:26.798 --> 04:54:30.160
Caption: and maybe only for a certain amount of

04:54:28.480 --> 04:54:31.599
Caption: time

04:54:30.160 --> 04:54:33.519
Caption: but it&#39;s probably something you need

04:54:31.599 --> 04:54:35.279
Caption: otherwise they can&#39;t go offline for more

04:54:33.519 --> 04:54:37.359
Caption: than an hour right so

04:54:35.279 --> 04:54:38.558
Caption: it would depend

04:54:37.359 --> 04:54:41.679
Caption: again

04:54:38.560 --> 04:54:42.798
Caption: on the consultant so it always depends

04:54:41.679 --> 04:54:44.560
Caption: but

04:54:42.798 --> 04:54:46.958
Caption: if you think about how what it means for

04:54:44.560 --> 04:54:48.240
Caption: you you know maybe you let people in

04:54:46.957 --> 04:54:49.759
Caption: and then before you actually save

04:54:48.240 --> 04:54:52.958
Caption: anything you do go and get that new

04:54:49.759 --> 04:54:55.119
Caption: token so that it all works

04:54:52.957 --> 04:54:58.279
Caption: but that&#39;s the sort of thing you need to

04:54:55.119 --> 04:54:58.279
Caption: think about

04:54:58.480 --> 04:55:02.718
Caption: another one i&#39;ve i&#39;ve got another

04:55:00.320 --> 04:55:04.638
Caption: challenge is if you want to build

04:55:02.718 --> 04:55:07.281
Caption: an offline web app so you could have

04:55:04.638 --> 04:55:09.201
Caption: like a mobile app which has its own

04:55:07.279 --> 04:55:11.599
Caption: challenges potentially

04:55:09.199 --> 04:55:14.636
Caption: but a web app is probably even bigger

04:55:11.599 --> 04:55:16.320
Caption: because the convention is that you would

04:55:14.638 --> 04:55:17.759
Caption: download everything essentially every

04:55:16.320 --> 04:55:19.439
Caption: time you visit the app

04:55:17.759 --> 04:55:20.796
Caption: you know you might have caching of style

04:55:19.439 --> 04:55:22.716
Caption: sheets and stuff

04:55:20.798 --> 04:55:24.160
Caption: through your cdn

04:55:22.718 --> 04:55:26.320
Caption: but if you&#39;re going to have a fully

04:55:24.160 --> 04:55:27.919
Caption: offline app you need to have that data

04:55:26.320 --> 04:55:29.839
Caption: saved on the device

04:55:27.919 --> 04:55:31.359
Caption: always

04:55:29.839 --> 04:55:33.199
Caption: so there are things to help you with

04:55:31.359 --> 04:55:35.119
Caption: that now like if you build a progressive

04:55:33.199 --> 04:55:36.238
Caption: web app for pwa

04:55:35.119 --> 04:55:37.599
Caption: then you get

04:55:36.240 --> 04:55:38.839
Caption: a lot of that stuff built in you have a

04:55:37.599 --> 04:55:41.599
Caption: service worker

04:55:38.839 --> 04:55:43.439
Caption: download so for later right it&#39;s not

04:55:41.599 --> 04:55:46.560
Caption: impossible but it is a little bit more

04:55:43.439 --> 04:55:48.240
Caption: difficult probably than a native app

04:55:46.560 --> 04:55:49.919
Caption: because native apps let you download all

04:55:48.240 --> 04:55:52.080
Caption: that stuff ahead of time anyway you know

04:55:49.919 --> 04:55:53.359
Caption: you download your app from the app store

04:55:52.080 --> 04:55:56.480
Caption: and it&#39;s

04:55:53.359 --> 04:55:57.519
Caption: 50 megabytes or whatever it is and all

04:55:56.480 --> 04:55:58.638
Caption: the stuff that you need there is

04:55:57.519 --> 04:56:00.000
Caption: included

04:55:58.638 --> 04:56:02.480
Caption: whereas on the web you download that

04:56:00.000 --> 04:56:02.480
Caption: every time

04:56:04.160 --> 04:56:08.480
Caption: and then the last sort of challenge

04:56:07.199 --> 04:56:12.478
Caption: that i&#39;ve

04:56:08.480 --> 04:56:13.919
Caption: i&#39;ve got to cover i guess is uh

04:56:12.480 --> 04:56:14.958
Caption: those features that just won&#39;t work so

04:56:13.919 --> 04:56:16.638
Caption: you know this is

04:56:14.957 --> 04:56:18.478
Caption: video streaming right that&#39;s not going

04:56:16.638 --> 04:56:19.759
Caption: to work you can&#39;t build

04:56:18.480 --> 04:56:20.958
Caption: teams or

04:56:19.759 --> 04:56:23.519
Caption: zoom

04:56:20.957 --> 04:56:25.359
Caption: if you&#39;re going for an offline app

04:56:23.519 --> 04:56:28.240
Caption: those features just won&#39;t work so there

04:56:25.359 --> 04:56:28.240
Caption: are there are limits

04:56:28.480 --> 04:56:32.480
Caption: now

04:56:30.240 --> 04:56:34.080
Caption: we&#39;ve talked a bunch about the benefits

04:56:32.480 --> 04:56:36.000
Caption: and the challenges that have come with

04:56:34.080 --> 04:56:37.359
Caption: this

04:56:36.000 --> 04:56:38.638
Caption: uh

04:56:37.359 --> 04:56:40.080
Caption: we talked about why you might want to

04:56:38.638 --> 04:56:41.759
Caption: build one so if you want to be used in

04:56:40.080 --> 04:56:42.480
Caption: remote areas

04:56:41.759 --> 04:56:44.957
Caption: or

04:56:42.480 --> 04:56:47.361
Caption: just in situational offline times you

04:56:44.957 --> 04:56:48.957
Caption: know someone&#39;s probably got a wi-fi only

04:56:47.359 --> 04:56:50.478
Caption: tablet or something

04:56:48.957 --> 04:56:51.919
Caption: if you wanted to bring that here and it

04:56:50.480 --> 04:56:53.679
Caption: didn&#39;t work because you didn&#39;t connect

04:56:51.919 --> 04:56:56.000
Caption: to the

04:56:53.679 --> 04:56:59.199
Caption: venue wi-fi or the venue wifi was bad

04:56:56.000 --> 04:56:59.199
Caption: then you&#39;d have a bad time

04:56:59.919 --> 04:57:03.679
Caption: and the benefits i guess are that

04:57:02.160 --> 04:57:05.279
Caption: you get a better experience for users

04:57:03.679 --> 04:57:09.279
Caption: they can use your app

04:57:05.279 --> 04:57:09.279
Caption: in more ways in more places

04:57:10.878 --> 04:57:14.560
Caption: and yeah we have to acknowledge that

04:57:12.560 --> 04:57:16.240
Caption: there are challenges with that so

04:57:14.560 --> 04:57:18.958
Caption: i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s easier to build an

04:57:16.240 --> 04:57:20.560
Caption: offline app than an online one

04:57:18.957 --> 04:57:22.636
Caption: but if you think that you&#39;re going to

04:57:20.560 --> 04:57:23.679
Caption: build an offline app

04:57:22.638 --> 04:57:24.560
Caption: or

04:57:23.679 --> 04:57:26.480
Caption: you know you&#39;re going to build an

04:57:24.560 --> 04:57:28.400
Caption: offline app or even if you just want to

04:57:26.480 --> 04:57:29.201
Caption: build an offline app

04:57:28.400 --> 04:57:31.599
Caption: then

04:57:29.199 --> 04:57:32.398
Caption: it&#39;s definitely easier to adopt that

04:57:31.599 --> 04:57:34.320
Caption: online

04:57:32.400 --> 04:57:35.759
Caption: sorry offline first

04:57:34.320 --> 04:57:37.839
Caption: mindset

04:57:35.759 --> 04:57:40.240
Caption: and treat it as the normal rather than

04:57:37.839 --> 04:57:41.279
Caption: trying to

04:57:40.240 --> 04:57:42.958
Caption: um

04:57:41.279 --> 04:57:44.240
Caption: trying to handle it later you know it&#39;s

04:57:42.957 --> 04:57:47.839
Caption: easy to know upfront what you&#39;re

04:57:44.240 --> 04:57:47.839
Caption: building and build it from the beginning

04:57:48.320 --> 04:57:52.320
Caption: so that&#39;s all i&#39;ve got today

04:57:51.279 --> 04:57:54.240
Caption: i didn&#39;t think i&#39;d have time for

04:57:52.320 --> 04:57:56.878
Caption: questions but i think i actually do so

04:57:54.240 --> 04:57:59.669
Caption: if anyone does have a couple

04:57:56.878 --> 04:58:05.841
Caption: thank you

04:57:59.669 --> 04:58:08.320
Caption: [Applause]

04:58:05.839 --> 04:58:11.439
Caption: uh anybody

04:58:08.320 --> 04:58:11.439
Caption: if not you got lunch yes

04:58:12.839 --> 04:58:18.359
Caption: hello don&#39;t know if they might be call

04:58:14.957 --> 04:58:18.359
Caption: out and i&#39;ll repeat

04:58:28.160 --> 04:58:32.160
Caption: cool so the question was

04:58:30.000 --> 04:58:34.160
Caption: how would basically how do you encrypt

04:58:32.160 --> 04:58:34.958
Caption: data on the client side

04:58:34.160 --> 04:58:37.041
Caption: uh

04:58:34.957 --> 04:58:38.876
Caption: so

04:58:37.039 --> 04:58:40.398
Caption: there are many ways to encrypt let&#39;s

04:58:38.878 --> 04:58:42.718
Caption: assume you&#39;ve got like a public private

04:58:40.400 --> 04:58:44.400
Caption: key pair or something which is a pretty

04:58:42.718 --> 04:58:45.839
Caption: standard way to do it

04:58:44.400 --> 04:58:48.638
Caption: you would

04:58:45.839 --> 04:58:49.839
Caption: essentially probably sit

04:58:48.638 --> 04:58:52.000
Caption: rather than

04:58:49.839 --> 04:58:54.240
Caption: getting the data

04:58:52.000 --> 04:58:55.839
Caption: on your device

04:58:54.240 --> 04:58:56.958
Caption: you would download it in encrypted

04:58:55.839 --> 04:58:59.199
Caption: format

04:58:56.957 --> 04:59:01.599
Caption: um i would expect

04:58:59.199 --> 04:59:01.599
Caption: and then

04:59:01.679 --> 04:59:05.679
Caption: have something on your device to decrypt

04:59:03.359 --> 04:59:07.279
Caption: it so if you have a private public key

04:59:05.679 --> 04:59:10.080
Caption: for example the private key can stay on

04:59:07.279 --> 04:59:12.240
Caption: the server public key on your device the

04:59:10.080 --> 04:59:14.400
Caption: way those two things work is that

04:59:12.240 --> 04:59:16.320
Caption: anything encrypted by the private key

04:59:14.400 --> 04:59:18.160
Caption: can be decrypted by the public key and

04:59:16.320 --> 04:59:20.240
Caption: you can verify that that&#39;s where it came

04:59:18.160 --> 04:59:24.718
Caption: from so that does kind of give you that

04:59:20.240 --> 04:59:25.759
Caption: option to to download the data

04:59:24.718 --> 04:59:27.361
Caption: if you&#39;re going to do something like

04:59:25.759 --> 04:59:29.679
Caption: encryption that will

04:59:27.359 --> 04:59:32.796
Caption: probably dramatically slow down the app

04:59:29.679 --> 04:59:35.039
Caption: because you&#39;ll have to decrypt it

04:59:32.798 --> 04:59:37.761
Caption: all the time and there are going to be

04:59:35.039 --> 04:59:39.679
Caption: gaps where it&#39;s in memory and stuff so

04:59:37.759 --> 04:59:41.759
Caption: when they talk about those kind of hacks

04:59:39.679 --> 04:59:43.839
Caption: like um i&#39;m trying to get the names of

04:59:41.759 --> 04:59:45.679
Caption: them but they have all these memory

04:59:43.839 --> 04:59:47.439
Caption: overflow like buffer overflow attacks

04:59:45.679 --> 04:59:48.957
Caption: and stuff you&#39;re probably still gonna be

04:59:47.439 --> 04:59:51.199
Caption: vulnerable to that kind of stuff it&#39;s

04:59:48.957 --> 04:59:53.839
Caption: not a perfect solution but there&#39;s

04:59:51.199 --> 04:59:53.839
Caption: something there right

04:59:55.519 --> 04:59:58.320
Caption: cool another one

05:00:03.279 --> 05:00:06.279
Caption: yep

05:00:14.160 --> 05:00:18.080
Caption: yeah so

05:00:16.000 --> 05:00:19.279
Caption: when we stopped waiting for the response

05:00:18.080 --> 05:00:20.798
Caption: and we just kind of updated the

05:00:19.279 --> 05:00:22.240
Caption: background

05:00:20.798 --> 05:00:24.400
Caption: uh

05:00:22.240 --> 05:00:26.160
Caption: yeah like like you said you would get

05:00:24.400 --> 05:00:27.519
Caption: your style data first and then you&#39;d

05:00:26.160 --> 05:00:29.359
Caption: replace it with the new data when it

05:00:27.519 --> 05:00:31.519
Caption: came in so it wouldn&#39;t always have

05:00:29.359 --> 05:00:33.199
Caption: changed and you might see no difference

05:00:31.519 --> 05:00:34.876
Caption: but yeah if it did change you&#39;d have to

05:00:33.199 --> 05:00:37.039
Caption: handle that so again that&#39;s going to

05:00:34.878 --> 05:00:40.080
Caption: depend how you want to handle it

05:00:37.039 --> 05:00:41.919
Caption: if you&#39;re okay with it being

05:00:40.080 --> 05:00:43.919
Caption: you know initially stale data and then

05:00:41.919 --> 05:00:47.359
Caption: getting the updated data i guess if you

05:00:43.919 --> 05:00:51.160
Caption: don&#39;t fetch that data then you would

05:00:47.359 --> 05:00:51.160
Caption: always get a stale one

05:01:21.359 --> 05:01:25.119
Caption: yeah so the idea being that

05:01:24.240 --> 05:01:26.718
Caption: if you

05:01:25.119 --> 05:01:28.000
Caption: kind of do that process will you update

05:01:26.718 --> 05:01:29.761
Caption: it after the fact that there&#39;s stale

05:01:28.000 --> 05:01:30.957
Caption: data does it always make sense to do

05:01:29.759 --> 05:01:33.119
Caption: that

05:01:30.957 --> 05:01:33.119
Caption: so

05:01:33.679 --> 05:01:36.480
Caption: yeah

05:01:34.638 --> 05:01:37.839
Caption: so something like let&#39;s say in the top

05:01:36.480 --> 05:01:39.121
Caption: right you&#39;ve got a user avatar or

05:01:37.839 --> 05:01:41.119
Caption: something right if that just updates

05:01:39.119 --> 05:01:43.039
Caption: randomly it doesn&#39;t matter

05:01:41.119 --> 05:01:44.957
Caption: if you&#39;ve just clicked to open something

05:01:43.039 --> 05:01:46.796
Caption: and that updates later like i said it

05:01:44.957 --> 05:01:50.238
Caption: might be jarring where

05:01:46.798 --> 05:01:52.638
Caption: everything changes on them you know

05:01:50.240 --> 05:01:54.400
Caption: you&#39;ll have to decide what works for you

05:01:52.638 --> 05:01:56.798
Caption: potentially you just update lists of

05:01:54.400 --> 05:01:59.281
Caption: things like that so you see the old list

05:01:56.798 --> 05:02:00.320
Caption: first and then the new one loads in

05:01:59.279 --> 05:02:02.796
Caption: there are kind of

05:02:00.320 --> 05:02:05.439
Caption: balances i guess

05:02:02.798 --> 05:02:09.361
Caption: it depends but i hate to say that all

05:02:05.439 --> 05:02:09.359
Caption: the time but it generally does depend

05:02:09.919 --> 05:02:15.679
Caption: cool one more maybe hello

05:02:13.439 --> 05:02:15.679
Caption: sorry

05:02:24.400 --> 05:02:27.439
Caption: um

05:02:25.359 --> 05:02:29.839
Caption: i don&#39;t have any particular thoughts on

05:02:27.439 --> 05:02:31.279
Caption: that i guess um

05:02:29.839 --> 05:02:33.519
Caption: if it&#39;s

05:02:31.279 --> 05:02:34.398
Caption: capable of being offline which is

05:02:33.519 --> 05:02:36.000
Caption: everything right they&#39;ve all got an

Caption: um

05:02:47.519 --> 05:02:50.480
Caption: if you&#39;re gonna download gigabytes of

05:02:48.878 --> 05:02:51.761
Caption: data then you&#39;re probably gonna have a

05:02:50.480 --> 05:02:54.400

Caption: session here today

06:08:55.439 --> 06:09:00.478
Caption: and i just briefly want to mention slido

06:08:58.320 --> 06:09:02.878
Caption: which is the platform that you can go to

06:09:00.480 --> 06:09:03.599
Caption: if you haven&#39;t already to interact with

06:09:02.878 --> 06:09:06.000
Caption: the

06:09:03.599 --> 06:09:07.199
Caption: panel today ask some questions have a

06:09:06.000 --> 06:09:10.718
Caption: look at the questions that have already

06:09:07.199 --> 06:09:12.000
Caption: been asked upvote them and that&#39;s the

06:09:10.718 --> 06:09:13.839
Caption: way that you can

06:09:12.000 --> 06:09:15.599
Caption: interact with these fine folks on stage

06:09:13.839 --> 06:09:18.080
Caption: today

06:09:15.599 --> 06:09:21.439
Caption: but given that we only have half an hour

06:09:18.080 --> 06:09:21.439
Caption: let&#39;s kick straight into it

06:09:22.400 --> 06:09:27.599
Caption: and our first question which i&#39;m sure is

06:09:25.439 --> 06:09:28.796
Caption: very topical uh given the market at the

06:09:27.599 --> 06:09:30.796
Caption: moment

06:09:28.798 --> 06:09:33.121
Caption: what&#39;s the software developer employment

06:09:30.798 --> 06:09:35.361
Caption: ecosystem like at the moment if you&#39;re

06:09:33.119 --> 06:09:37.439
Caption: wanting to hire a full-time developer

06:09:35.359 --> 06:09:40.478
Caption: do you recruit locally do you recruit

06:09:37.439 --> 06:09:42.796
Caption: overseas do you recruit remotely

06:09:40.480 --> 06:09:44.638
Caption: sam you&#39;re a vp of engineering you do a

06:09:42.798 --> 06:09:45.761
Caption: lot of recruitment what&#39;s your take on

06:09:44.638 --> 06:09:48.798
Caption: this

06:09:45.759 --> 06:09:50.558
Caption: so i think it really depends on the size

06:09:48.798 --> 06:09:54.160
Caption: of the organization and the maturity of

06:09:50.558 --> 06:09:56.000
Caption: the process of processes

06:09:54.160 --> 06:09:57.919
Caption: so particularly if you were to consider

06:09:56.000 --> 06:09:59.439
Caption: at the really small and

06:09:57.919 --> 06:10:00.718
Caption: attack startup

06:09:59.439 --> 06:10:02.400
Caption: they&#39;re going to

06:10:00.718 --> 06:10:05.041
Caption: be very dynamic it&#39;s going to be a very

06:10:02.400 --> 06:10:07.201
Caption: fast-paced environment so managing a

06:10:05.039 --> 06:10:08.636
Caption: like highly remote or overseas

06:10:07.199 --> 06:10:10.636
Caption: particularly when time zones are

06:10:08.638 --> 06:10:12.558
Caption: involved uh workforce is going to be

06:10:10.638 --> 06:10:14.240
Caption: extremely challenging and not really

06:10:12.558 --> 06:10:15.919
Caption: lead to the business outcomes that are

06:10:14.240 --> 06:10:17.679
Caption: required at that stage for that

06:10:15.919 --> 06:10:19.279
Caption: institution

06:10:17.679 --> 06:10:21.759
Caption: on the other hand on the other hand if

06:10:19.279 --> 06:10:23.919
Caption: you&#39;re like companies like google or

06:10:21.759 --> 06:10:26.160
Caption: any other kind of large organization are

06:10:23.919 --> 06:10:29.359
Caption: more likely to have rigorous process in

06:10:26.160 --> 06:10:30.400
Caption: place and better support for people so

06:10:29.359 --> 06:10:32.080
Caption: i think it&#39;s sort of a bit of a

06:10:30.400 --> 06:10:33.919
Caption: balancing act so i think the larger

06:10:32.080 --> 06:10:35.839
Caption: organizations are going to be more

06:10:33.919 --> 06:10:37.599
Caption: readily able to

06:10:35.839 --> 06:10:39.359
Caption: remotely hire

06:10:37.599 --> 06:10:41.119
Caption: and then i think you know in the middle

06:10:39.359 --> 06:10:43.839
Caption: there&#39;s probably a bit of a mix and a

06:10:41.119 --> 06:10:43.839
Caption: bit of a balance

06:10:44.160 --> 06:10:48.400
Caption: thank you very much

06:10:45.759 --> 06:10:50.796
Caption: uh on to an extremely popular question

06:10:48.400 --> 06:10:50.798
Caption: next

06:10:51.519 --> 06:10:57.519
Caption: should i add nfts or crypto to my

06:10:54.558 --> 06:10:57.521
Caption: software project

06:10:58.718 --> 06:11:03.839
Caption: if you do it accessibly i guess that&#39;s

06:11:01.119 --> 06:11:03.839
Caption: acceptable

06:11:04.000 --> 06:11:08.080
Caption: serrata we uh rather um christina i

06:11:06.638 --> 06:11:09.441
Caption: believe we talked about this last night

06:11:08.080 --> 06:11:12.878
Caption: what&#39;s what&#39;s your thoughts on this

06:11:09.439 --> 06:11:13.759
Caption: matter um i do a lot of startup advising

06:11:12.878 --> 06:11:17.521
Caption: and

06:11:13.759 --> 06:11:19.119
Caption: um i&#39;m going to say what advice i

06:11:17.519 --> 06:11:20.556
Caption: usually give them so

06:11:19.119 --> 06:11:24.636
Caption: you know

06:11:20.558 --> 06:11:26.240
Caption: if you have something attached to

06:11:24.638 --> 06:11:28.558
Caption: somebody who&#39;s really popular it&#39;s a

06:11:26.240 --> 06:11:29.359
Caption: celebrity it&#39;s something like that you

06:11:28.558 --> 06:11:31.919
Caption: can

06:11:29.359 --> 06:11:34.556
Caption: trade it you can sell it you can quickly

06:11:31.919 --> 06:11:38.240
Caption: turn it over it&#39;s while it still holds

06:11:34.558 --> 06:11:41.361
Caption: its value then yes absolutely

06:11:38.240 --> 06:11:43.759
Caption: um if not then it&#39;s just too risky

06:11:41.359 --> 06:11:46.796
Caption: especially for like i said startups who

06:11:43.759 --> 06:11:48.558
Caption: are starting these new projects or or

06:11:46.798 --> 06:11:51.361
Caption: people who

06:11:48.558 --> 06:11:55.121
Caption: maybe don&#39;t even quite understand how

06:11:51.359 --> 06:11:57.199
Caption: data are transferred along the way and

06:11:55.119 --> 06:11:59.759
Caption: the lifetime and the sustainability of

06:11:57.199 --> 06:12:01.439
Caption: it i have somebody that i worked with in

Caption: he yeah i put this art in here well okay

06:12:13.439 --> 06:12:18.000
Caption: but you put uh

06:12:15.519 --> 06:12:20.957
Caption: art for a famous artist that has

06:12:18.000 --> 06:12:23.599
Caption: significant value already um a lot of

06:12:20.957 --> 06:12:26.796
Caption: people that are coming to him are having

06:12:23.599 --> 06:12:28.556
Caption: issues because after people pass they

06:12:26.798 --> 06:12:29.361
Caption: can&#39;t access

06:12:28.558 --> 06:12:31.679
Caption: their

06:12:29.359 --> 06:12:33.759
Caption: nft they can&#39;t access their stuff and

06:12:31.679 --> 06:12:35.839
Caption: there&#39;s not a system in place for that

06:12:33.759 --> 06:12:36.716
Caption: and that&#39;s a lot of money that that&#39;s

06:12:35.839 --> 06:12:39.199
Caption: been

06:12:36.718 --> 06:12:40.400
Caption: lost we also in that

06:12:39.199 --> 06:12:43.519
Caption: same ecosystem

06:12:40.400 --> 06:12:45.519

Caption: two and a half million dollars on their

06:12:45.519 --> 06:12:49.599
Caption: discord server and then one day he said

06:12:48.400 --> 06:12:50.958
Caption: you know what

06:12:49.599 --> 06:12:52.556
Caption: this is just really stressful i&#39;m

06:12:50.957 --> 06:12:54.238
Caption: shutting everything down anybody who put

06:12:52.558 --> 06:12:55.601
Caption: in fifteen hundred dollars i&#39;m just

06:12:54.240 --> 06:12:58.000
Caption: going to give you a signed jersey and

06:12:55.599 --> 06:12:59.679
Caption: thanks for playing and he took their 2.3

06:12:58.000 --> 06:13:02.080
Caption: million dollars and left

06:12:59.679 --> 06:13:04.320
Caption: and it&#39;s there&#39;s no repercussions for

06:13:02.080 --> 06:13:07.359
Caption: that and all of the kids that had looked

06:13:04.320 --> 06:13:08.718
Caption: up for to him who didn&#39;t have the money

06:13:07.359 --> 06:13:11.439
Caption: to invest in

06:13:08.718 --> 06:13:13.281
Caption: in what he was offering

06:13:11.439 --> 06:13:14.957
Caption: they invested it anyway because he&#39;s

06:13:13.279 --> 06:13:16.636
Caption: like their cool idol

06:13:14.957 --> 06:13:18.398
Caption: he took their money and left and and

06:13:16.638 --> 06:13:21.441
Caption: those kids you know they they can&#39;t get

06:13:18.400 --> 06:13:24.320
Caption: that money back so um i i think that if

06:13:21.439 --> 06:13:26.876
Caption: you can turn it over quickly and if it&#39;s

06:13:24.320 --> 06:13:28.878
Caption: attached to something that&#39;s high value

06:13:26.878 --> 06:13:29.681
Caption: and you can get that value and extract

06:13:28.878 --> 06:13:32.000
Caption: it

06:13:29.679 --> 06:13:33.279
Caption: you know within 12 months or so then it

06:13:32.000 --> 06:13:35.599
Caption: would be worth it

06:13:33.279 --> 06:13:37.359
Caption: otherwise i don&#39;t i don&#39;t see the the

06:13:35.599 --> 06:13:38.716
Caption: use for that we have another startup

06:13:37.359 --> 06:13:43.439
Caption: who&#39;s trying to

06:13:38.718 --> 06:13:46.480
Caption: attach uh grades in schools to follow

06:13:43.439 --> 06:13:49.279
Caption: uh the the child and their progression

06:13:46.480 --> 06:13:50.480
Caption: through their to college and um i just

06:13:49.279 --> 06:13:52.000
Caption: don&#39;t think that&#39;s sustainable the

06:13:50.480 --> 06:13:54.480
Caption: amount of energy and effort that&#39;s

06:13:52.000 --> 06:13:56.798
Caption: that&#39;s required to to track all of that

06:13:54.480 --> 06:13:58.638
Caption: it&#39;s just it&#39;s not there

06:13:56.798 --> 06:14:01.441
Caption: and i think it&#39;s environmentally

06:13:58.638 --> 06:14:01.441
Caption: irresponsible

06:14:02.000 --> 06:14:07.039
Caption: well cement so

06:14:03.359 --> 06:14:08.957
Caption: okay another really big question

06:14:07.039 --> 06:14:11.679
Caption: where will machine learning have the

06:14:08.957 --> 06:14:13.679
Caption: biggest impact in the next 10 years

06:14:11.679 --> 06:14:14.558
Caption: serata

06:14:13.679 --> 06:14:16.876
Caption: um

06:14:14.558 --> 06:14:18.798
Caption: it&#39;s very tough question even we will

06:14:16.878 --> 06:14:20.638
Caption: look back um in the last

06:14:18.798 --> 06:14:24.160
Caption: last couple of months

06:14:20.638 --> 06:14:28.320
Caption: we have such a big um breakthrough in um

06:14:24.160 --> 06:14:30.718
Caption: generative area so i even can&#39;t imagine

06:14:28.320 --> 06:14:33.759
Caption: how the world going to be in the next

06:14:30.718 --> 06:14:35.919
Caption: few months so looking into you can just

06:14:33.759 --> 06:14:37.919
Caption: type in a simple um

06:14:35.919 --> 06:14:40.000
Caption: test message to describe the scene and

06:14:37.919 --> 06:14:42.558
Caption: the computer can completely generate for

06:14:40.000 --> 06:14:44.957
Caption: you and also recently just have our

06:14:42.558 --> 06:14:47.121
Caption: competition and the machine already

06:14:44.957 --> 06:14:50.078
Caption: beaten the human

06:14:47.119 --> 06:14:52.478
Caption: so all these changes um

06:14:50.080 --> 06:14:55.119
Caption: can be scary and i think one of the

06:14:52.480 --> 06:14:57.361
Caption: speakers also talking about defects so i

06:14:55.119 --> 06:15:00.318
Caption: think we really need to worry about the

06:14:57.359 --> 06:15:01.439
Caption: social impacts what is real or what is

06:15:00.320 --> 06:15:02.480
Caption: not real

06:15:01.439 --> 06:15:05.439
Caption: and

06:15:02.480 --> 06:15:08.240
Caption: for the longer horizons i really want to

06:15:05.439 --> 06:15:10.876
Caption: see the medical research continue to

06:15:08.240 --> 06:15:12.839
Caption: improve and have a big impact for our

06:15:10.878 --> 06:15:16.400
Caption: health

06:15:12.839 --> 06:15:19.039
Caption: from i think it&#39;s more the regulatory to

06:15:16.400 --> 06:15:22.160
Caption: catch up the technology rather than the

06:15:19.039 --> 06:15:24.636
Caption: the diagnosis on its own but i really

06:15:22.160 --> 06:15:28.480
Caption: want to see that have a better

06:15:24.638 --> 06:15:30.798
Caption: improvement in our health system

06:15:28.480 --> 06:15:32.080
Caption: all right thank you very much

06:15:30.798 --> 06:15:33.761
Caption: i&#39;m going to throw this next one to

06:15:32.080 --> 06:15:35.279
Caption: julie

06:15:33.759 --> 06:15:38.080
Caption: so what&#39;s the first thing that you look

06:15:35.279 --> 06:15:39.839
Caption: for when doing an accessibility audit uh

06:15:38.080 --> 06:15:42.080
Caption: what do you do when you&#39;re building

06:15:39.839 --> 06:15:43.519
Caption: something new

06:15:42.080 --> 06:15:45.759
Caption: so if i&#39;m

06:15:43.519 --> 06:15:47.759
Caption: looking just starting out a fresh audit

06:15:45.759 --> 06:15:49.599
Caption: the first thing that i always look at is

06:15:47.759 --> 06:15:50.957
Caption: i open up dev tools and the elements

06:15:49.599 --> 06:15:53.199
Caption: panel and i look at the quality of the

06:15:50.957 --> 06:15:54.957
Caption: html

06:15:53.199 --> 06:15:58.160
Caption: that tells you a lot about where to

06:15:54.957 --> 06:16:00.796
Caption: pitch the rest of the testing and the

06:15:58.160 --> 06:16:04.798
Caption: verification because good good quality

06:16:00.798 --> 06:16:06.718
Caption: html is the the basis of what goes into

06:16:04.798 --> 06:16:08.958
Caption: our accessibility api and then gets

06:16:06.718 --> 06:16:09.681
Caption: passed on to assistive technology

06:16:08.957 --> 06:16:12.398
Caption: so

06:16:09.679 --> 06:16:14.480
Caption: you can learn so much from that part

06:16:12.400 --> 06:16:16.320
Caption: if i&#39;m testing i generally test heading

06:16:14.480 --> 06:16:19.041
Caption: structure first because that has a

06:16:16.320 --> 06:16:22.160
Caption: benefit for so many people

06:16:19.039 --> 06:16:25.519
Caption: if i&#39;m building something fresh i do

06:16:22.160 --> 06:16:26.878
Caption: again start with that html

06:16:25.519 --> 06:16:29.039
Caption: we sort of sometimes talk about the

06:16:26.878 --> 06:16:32.480
Caption: accessibility stack

06:16:29.039 --> 06:16:34.478
Caption: being html css javascript and aria it&#39;s

06:16:32.480 --> 06:16:37.599
Caption: a purely front-end stack

06:16:34.480 --> 06:16:38.958
Caption: and it&#39;s less of a stack and more of a

06:16:37.599 --> 06:16:41.039
Caption: pyramid

06:16:38.957 --> 06:16:43.039
Caption: with html giving you so much

06:16:41.039 --> 06:16:45.279
Caption: accessibility for free

06:16:43.039 --> 06:16:46.796
Caption: that if you get that right then

06:16:45.279 --> 06:16:48.957
Caption: everything else that you&#39;re doing is

06:16:46.798 --> 06:16:51.441
Caption: just enhancing and making more usable

06:16:48.957 --> 06:16:54.078
Caption: and extending to a wider range of people

06:16:51.439 --> 06:16:55.919
Caption: but that that bedrock if i could give

06:16:54.080 --> 06:16:57.599
Caption: one piece of accessibility advice to

06:16:55.919 --> 06:16:59.359
Caption: people who don&#39;t have time to learn

06:16:57.599 --> 06:17:02.080
Caption: accessibility

06:16:59.359 --> 06:17:03.679
Caption: learn html really really get into those

06:17:02.080 --> 06:17:05.519
Caption: mdn

06:17:03.679 --> 06:17:07.839
Caption: definitions and really get to know it

06:17:05.519 --> 06:17:07.839
Caption: really well

06:17:08.638 --> 06:17:11.919
Caption: okay thank you very much

06:17:10.558 --> 06:17:15.121
Caption: i think this next one is a great

06:17:11.919 --> 06:17:17.679
Caption: question um and i i might actually throw

06:17:15.119 --> 06:17:20.000
Caption: it open to the panel to see um

06:17:17.679 --> 06:17:22.240
Caption: maybe if there&#39;s multiple insights on it

06:17:20.000 --> 06:17:24.400
Caption: but how do you convince your company to

06:17:22.240 --> 06:17:25.679
Caption: care about privacy and i assume from

06:17:24.400 --> 06:17:28.878
Caption: this perspective we&#39;re talking about the

06:17:25.679 --> 06:17:28.876
Caption: privacy of its customers

06:17:29.439 --> 06:17:34.478
Caption: i&#39;m actually going to jump in here and

06:17:31.119 --> 06:17:36.478
Caption: say without being a privacy expert

06:17:34.480 --> 06:17:37.839
Caption: i have had experience with trying to get

06:17:36.480 --> 06:17:40.638
Caption: organizations to care about

06:17:37.839 --> 06:17:42.400
Caption: accessibility which along with security

06:17:40.638 --> 06:17:44.240
Caption: is one of those things that seems a bit

06:17:42.400 --> 06:17:45.679
Caption: nebulous and fuzzy

06:17:44.240 --> 06:17:49.121
Caption: and how do you know when you&#39;re doing it

06:17:45.679 --> 06:17:51.679
Caption: well but everybody puts it off to care

06:17:49.119 --> 06:17:52.556
Caption: about later after they&#39;ve shipped

06:17:51.679 --> 06:17:54.000
Caption: um

06:17:52.558 --> 06:17:56.718
Caption: we tend to

06:17:54.000 --> 06:17:58.957
Caption: go for you you kind of need a grassroots

06:17:56.718 --> 06:18:00.718
Caption: kind of level of support and often that

06:17:58.957 --> 06:18:03.759
Caption: comes from one person taking it on and

06:18:00.718 --> 06:18:06.000
Caption: becoming a champion but not

06:18:03.759 --> 06:18:07.679
Caption: telling other people off for doing it

06:18:06.000 --> 06:18:10.718
Caption: wrong but more praising them when they

06:18:07.679 --> 06:18:13.839
Caption: get it right and

06:18:10.718 --> 06:18:16.000
Caption: being a bit pesky in meetings about

06:18:13.839 --> 06:18:17.679
Caption: like oh yes this is an accessibility

06:18:16.000 --> 06:18:20.000
Caption: issue i assume you could do the same

06:18:17.679 --> 06:18:22.558
Caption: with privacy this is a privacy issue we

06:18:20.000 --> 06:18:23.439
Caption: should absolutely be thinking about this

06:18:22.558 --> 06:18:25.281
Caption: now

06:18:23.439 --> 06:18:28.478
Caption: um and then

06:18:25.279 --> 06:18:30.636
Caption: buttonhole the people in charge and uh

06:18:28.480 --> 06:18:32.080
Caption: harass them into caring

06:18:30.638 --> 06:18:33.839
Caption: because you will not leave them alone

06:18:32.080 --> 06:18:34.718
Caption: until they do

06:18:33.839 --> 06:18:36.240
Caption: this

06:18:34.718 --> 06:18:37.919
Caption: sounds very informal but it&#39;s been a

06:18:36.240 --> 06:18:39.359
Caption: winning formula for many many large

06:18:37.919 --> 06:18:40.160
Caption: organizations

06:18:39.359 --> 06:18:41.679
Caption: um

06:18:40.160 --> 06:18:45.359
Caption: this is being recorded and being sent

06:18:41.679 --> 06:18:47.519
Caption: out so sorry to my clients

06:18:45.359 --> 06:18:50.556
Caption: i can cheer in a little bit as well

06:18:47.519 --> 06:18:53.039
Caption: because i deal with medical data so um

06:18:50.558 --> 06:18:56.080
Caption: it&#39;s in view in the organization level

06:18:53.039 --> 06:18:58.796
Caption: they already aware the importance of the

06:18:56.080 --> 06:18:59.679
Caption: privacy but from the development side we

06:18:58.798 --> 06:19:02.958
Caption: also

06:18:59.679 --> 06:19:05.919
Caption: cons concerned about we put it on the

06:19:02.957 --> 06:19:08.876
Caption: cloud service where is the location um

06:19:05.919 --> 06:19:10.718
Caption: we share the responsibility make sure we

06:19:08.878 --> 06:19:13.601
Caption: have the right access so

06:19:10.718 --> 06:19:15.361
Caption: and also reminding them your your boss

06:19:13.599 --> 06:19:18.240
Caption: if they fail to do it they will have a

06:19:15.359 --> 06:19:21.119
Caption: big fight from their gdpr so yeah they

06:19:18.240 --> 06:19:21.121
Caption: will make the decision

06:19:21.199 --> 06:19:25.679
Caption: yeah that&#39;s great

06:19:22.957 --> 06:19:26.556
Caption: i think it&#39;s a great oh sam thanks yeah

06:19:25.679 --> 06:19:29.439
Caption: um

06:19:26.558 --> 06:19:31.041
Caption: this is a kind of funny one but

06:19:29.439 --> 06:19:34.240
Caption: i think

06:19:31.039 --> 06:19:35.919
Caption: like what as julie said um

06:19:34.240 --> 06:19:38.240
Caption: if you can hire someone whose

06:19:35.919 --> 06:19:40.240
Caption: responsibility it is to really focus on

06:19:38.240 --> 06:19:42.160
Caption: privacy and keep up to date particularly

06:19:40.240 --> 06:19:44.320
Caption: from a legal perspective and what that

06:19:42.160 --> 06:19:47.279
Caption: means to your organization and that&#39;s

06:19:44.320 --> 06:19:48.160
Caption: sort of a huge win but then obviously

06:19:47.279 --> 06:19:50.000
Caption: getting

06:19:48.160 --> 06:19:52.638
Caption: executive support in that and really

06:19:50.000 --> 06:19:54.558
Caption: creating a culture so privacy really is

06:19:52.638 --> 06:19:55.521
Caption: a cultural issue so

06:19:54.558 --> 06:19:57.839
Caption: it&#39;s

06:19:55.519 --> 06:19:59.519
Caption: making everyone understand what it means

06:19:57.839 --> 06:20:00.240
Caption: to customers

06:19:59.519 --> 06:20:02.556
Caption: and

06:20:00.240 --> 06:20:03.599
Caption: what it means like what&#39;s stored in data

06:20:02.558 --> 06:20:05.441
Caption: and then

06:20:03.599 --> 06:20:06.716
Caption: rather than i guess

06:20:05.439 --> 06:20:08.478
Caption: to use a

06:20:06.718 --> 06:20:10.878
Caption: perhaps important but rather than to

06:20:08.480 --> 06:20:12.558
Caption: bore people with legal jargon

06:20:10.878 --> 06:20:14.240
Caption: um it&#39;s really great if you&#39;ve got that

06:20:12.558 --> 06:20:17.361
Caption: champion or sort of

06:20:14.240 --> 06:20:18.480
Caption: i guess ambassador to

06:20:17.359 --> 06:20:19.279
Caption: sort of

06:20:18.480 --> 06:20:21.441
Caption: re

06:20:19.279 --> 06:20:23.199
Caption: relay what it means to individual teams

06:20:21.439 --> 06:20:25.199
Caption: and how that like provides simple

06:20:23.199 --> 06:20:28.080
Caption: patterns for how that they can approach

06:20:25.199 --> 06:20:30.080
Caption: privacy in their day-to-day work

06:20:28.080 --> 06:20:32.480
Caption: yeah great input from all of our

06:20:30.080 --> 06:20:36.240
Caption: panelists there i&#39;m going to change

06:20:32.480 --> 06:20:38.798
Caption: gears slightly here and move more to

06:20:36.240 --> 06:20:40.558
Caption: individual development and

06:20:38.798 --> 06:20:43.441
Caption: the way that that&#39;s aligned in the

06:20:40.558 --> 06:20:43.441
Caption: market right now

06:20:43.599 --> 06:20:47.919
Caption: what&#39;s the best thing that i can invest

06:20:45.519 --> 06:20:51.039
Caption: in outside of work to make myself

06:20:47.919 --> 06:20:54.558
Caption: attractive to an employer

06:20:51.039 --> 06:20:57.839
Caption: i do a lot of career mentorship for

06:20:54.558 --> 06:20:59.441
Caption: developers specifically and about how to

06:20:57.839 --> 06:21:00.558
Caption: lead from within and so

06:20:59.439 --> 06:21:03.599
Caption: [Music]

06:21:00.558 --> 06:21:05.441
Caption: an investment really is in yourself and

06:21:03.599 --> 06:21:08.636
Caption: making yourself look attractive and the

06:21:05.439 --> 06:21:11.119
Caption: way that we do that is by helping other

06:21:08.638 --> 06:21:15.601
Caption: people and lifting them up you build a

06:21:11.119 --> 06:21:19.519
Caption: community around you you build a a

06:21:15.599 --> 06:21:21.359
Caption: tribe of advocates for yourself and so

06:21:19.519 --> 06:21:22.957
Caption: they&#39;re going to be allies they&#39;re going

06:21:21.359 --> 06:21:27.119
Caption: to be supporters they&#39;re going to be

06:21:22.957 --> 06:21:29.119
Caption: sponsors and you become

06:21:27.119 --> 06:21:30.957
Caption: you know this brand

06:21:29.119 --> 06:21:34.080
Caption: that is

06:21:30.957 --> 06:21:36.078
Caption: essentially somebody who is a leader now

06:21:34.080 --> 06:21:38.638
Caption: you already have a brand whether you

06:21:36.080 --> 06:21:41.359
Caption: want to admit it or not right so as

06:21:38.638 --> 06:21:43.919
Caption: you&#39;re sitting in your team you already

06:21:41.359 --> 06:21:46.556
Caption: are represented representing certain

06:21:43.919 --> 06:21:48.480
Caption: values you are representing

06:21:46.558 --> 06:21:49.839
Caption: how you present

06:21:48.480 --> 06:21:52.718
Caption: how you are

06:21:49.839 --> 06:21:56.000
Caption: showing up in with your

06:21:52.718 --> 06:21:58.240
Caption: address your appearance your attitudes

06:21:56.000 --> 06:21:59.519
Caption: you already have a brand the difference

06:21:58.240 --> 06:22:03.041
Caption: of course is that you&#39;re just going to

06:21:59.519 --> 06:22:05.039
Caption: be more intentional about that brand so

06:22:03.039 --> 06:22:07.359
Caption: i would advise everybody to go home and

06:22:05.039 --> 06:22:09.599
Caption: think about your top three to five core

06:22:07.359 --> 06:22:11.679
Caption: values that make you tick and then start

06:22:09.599 --> 06:22:14.000
Caption: making your choices your decisions start

06:22:11.679 --> 06:22:15.679
Caption: living your life around those those core

06:22:14.000 --> 06:22:17.439
Caption: values what&#39;s going to happen is you

06:22:15.679 --> 06:22:20.480
Caption: start to attract other people who share

06:22:17.439 --> 06:22:22.320
Caption: those core values those people

06:22:20.480 --> 06:22:24.798
Caption: like what you have they want to start

06:22:22.320 --> 06:22:27.519
Caption: doing what you do and in fact they&#39;re

06:22:24.798 --> 06:22:29.761
Caption: going to lift you up when they recognize

06:22:27.519 --> 06:22:31.279
Caption: somebody else doing those things oh you

06:22:29.759 --> 06:22:33.519
Caption: should go talk to

06:22:31.279 --> 06:22:35.439
Caption: to joe because you know joe does that he

06:22:33.519 --> 06:22:37.679
Caption: loves that you should go talk to susie

06:22:35.439 --> 06:22:40.080
Caption: susie loves doing that and so suddenly

06:22:37.679 --> 06:22:42.558
Caption: you start to create this brand for

06:22:40.080 --> 06:22:45.439
Caption: yourself and then you know decide to

06:22:42.558 --> 06:22:47.839
Caption: pick two different platforms to put that

06:22:45.439 --> 06:22:51.039
Caption: content out that represent your brand

06:22:47.839 --> 06:22:53.199
Caption: maybe it&#39;s tick-tock maybe it&#39;s facebook

06:22:51.039 --> 06:22:55.359
Caption: maybe it&#39;s just one-on-one speaking with

06:22:53.199 --> 06:22:56.876
Caption: people because that&#39;s that&#39;s what works

06:22:55.359 --> 06:22:59.279
Caption: for you maybe you send out some press

06:22:56.878 --> 06:23:02.240
Caption: releases i don&#39;t know but you can create

06:22:59.279 --> 06:23:04.240
Caption: yourself as a brand and you can lead

06:23:02.240 --> 06:23:06.320
Caption: within from within you don&#39;t have to be

06:23:04.240 --> 06:23:07.919
Caption: a leader you don&#39;t have to have a title

06:23:06.320 --> 06:23:10.480
Caption: um because at the end of the day you

06:23:07.919 --> 06:23:12.798
Caption: already have a reputation so it&#39;s up to

06:23:10.480 --> 06:23:16.798
Caption: you to kind of guide those conversations

06:23:12.798 --> 06:23:19.441
Caption: and around that reputation

06:23:16.798 --> 06:23:22.841
Caption: yeah thank you very much christina

06:23:19.439 --> 06:23:26.160
Caption: so let&#39;s say i&#39;ve built my brand

06:23:22.839 --> 06:23:26.957
Caption: and i&#39;ve got my job

06:23:26.160 --> 06:23:29.359
Caption: so

06:23:26.957 --> 06:23:31.279
Caption: in perth right now um

06:23:29.359 --> 06:23:34.398
Caption: salaries are

06:23:31.279 --> 06:23:35.919
Caption: you know growing um there&#39;s a bit of a

06:23:34.400 --> 06:23:38.878
Caption: certainly been a lot of

06:23:35.919 --> 06:23:42.480
Caption: heat in the market so to speak

06:23:38.878 --> 06:23:44.480
Caption: so i might throw this to sam first but

06:23:42.480 --> 06:23:45.839
Caption: is this just a bubble like is this just

06:23:44.480 --> 06:23:47.599
Caption: a temporary thing

06:23:45.839 --> 06:23:50.480
Caption: should i be concerned if i&#39;m an engineer

06:23:47.599 --> 06:23:50.480
Caption: in the market right now

06:23:51.199 --> 06:23:55.759
Caption: good question um i don&#39;t have the

06:23:53.279 --> 06:23:57.759
Caption: crystal ball uh i think there might be a

06:23:55.759 --> 06:23:59.439
Caption: tiny bit of a bubble but

06:23:57.759 --> 06:24:00.876
Caption: realistically it&#39;s

06:23:59.439 --> 06:24:02.796
Caption: my own personal take is that we don&#39;t

06:24:00.878 --> 06:24:04.958
Caption: really need to worry too much about that

06:24:02.798 --> 06:24:08.718
Caption: but just rather focus on ourselves and

06:24:04.957 --> 06:24:08.716
Caption: focus on our work and really

06:24:09.519 --> 06:24:13.199
Caption: yeah make sure that we&#39;re we&#39;re being

06:24:10.957 --> 06:24:15.519
Caption: our best knees and and i think we&#39;ll be

06:24:13.199 --> 06:24:15.519
Caption: okay

06:24:16.798 --> 06:24:21.121
Caption: okay

06:24:18.558 --> 06:24:22.240
Caption: i wanna somewhat related note

06:24:21.119 --> 06:24:24.398
Caption: so if you&#39;re a graduate and you&#39;re

06:24:22.240 --> 06:24:25.919
Caption: entering the market right now um it&#39;s

06:24:24.400 --> 06:24:28.400
Caption: obviously a bit different

06:24:25.919 --> 06:24:31.039
Caption: for than how it would be a few years ago

06:24:28.400 --> 06:24:33.361
Caption: even given covert and remote work and

06:24:31.039 --> 06:24:35.519
Caption: and things like that

06:24:33.359 --> 06:24:37.119
Caption: does the panel think that we&#39;re able to

06:24:35.519 --> 06:24:40.480
Caption: give grads enough support in their early

06:24:37.119 --> 06:24:40.478
Caption: years in the industry at the moment

06:24:41.919 --> 06:24:46.876
Caption: christina what do you think

06:24:44.160 --> 06:24:49.519
Caption: i think that if your communication

06:24:46.878 --> 06:24:51.201
Caption: processes and the

06:24:49.519 --> 06:24:54.400
Caption: way that you&#39;re

06:24:51.199 --> 06:24:56.318
Caption: organizing in your teams is done well

06:24:54.400 --> 06:24:58.320
Caption: with diversity equity and inclusion then

06:24:56.320 --> 06:25:00.718
Caption: that&#39;s not really an issue people can

06:24:58.320 --> 06:25:03.759
Caption: still feel connected as long as we are

06:25:00.718 --> 06:25:06.718
Caption: creating systems that um allow them to

06:25:03.759 --> 06:25:11.199
Caption: be connected in multiple different ways

06:25:06.718 --> 06:25:14.160
Caption: and so uh having uh diverse voices that

06:25:11.199 --> 06:25:16.398
Caption: feel like they&#39;re being heard if if you

06:25:14.160 --> 06:25:18.240
Caption: have that already then you don&#39;t have to

06:25:16.400 --> 06:25:20.798
Caption: worry about it that&#39;s that&#39;s not really

06:25:18.240 --> 06:25:23.519
Caption: an issue i have many friends who lead

06:25:20.798 --> 06:25:25.041
Caption: remote teams all over the world that are

06:25:23.519 --> 06:25:26.556
Caption: have never even met in person and

06:25:25.039 --> 06:25:28.556
Caption: they&#39;re very successful and they&#39;re very

06:25:26.558 --> 06:25:30.718
Caption: connected and sometimes when they do

06:25:28.558 --> 06:25:32.480
Caption: meet up at conferences they&#39;re besties

06:25:30.718 --> 06:25:34.160
Caption: and it&#39;s awesome because they already

06:25:32.480 --> 06:25:35.759
Caption: are very familiar with what&#39;s going on

06:25:34.160 --> 06:25:37.519
Caption: in each other&#39;s lives they have multiple

06:25:35.759 --> 06:25:38.796
Caption: ways for communicating

06:25:37.519 --> 06:25:40.240
Caption: and

06:25:38.798 --> 06:25:41.841
Caption: the nuance

06:25:40.240 --> 06:25:44.080
Caption: in that

06:25:41.839 --> 06:25:47.679
Caption: has to be prioritized the nuance of

06:25:44.080 --> 06:25:50.160
Caption: communication has to be prioritized

06:25:47.679 --> 06:25:52.796
Caption: through documentation through multiple

06:25:50.160 --> 06:25:55.519
Caption: ways of communicating and

06:25:52.798 --> 06:25:55.521

Caption: flying around the place last night

06:27:27.119 --> 06:27:31.279
Caption: a number of the panelists here have you

06:27:29.279 --> 06:27:32.796
Caption: know flown around the world and talked

06:27:31.279 --> 06:27:35.039
Caption: in various cities

06:27:32.798 --> 06:27:36.878
Caption: jacob asks is the perth technology

06:27:35.039 --> 06:27:38.957
Caption: sector lacking anything in particular

06:27:36.878 --> 06:27:41.361
Caption: compared to the eastern states or

06:27:38.957 --> 06:27:43.519
Caption: overseas right now or is

06:27:41.359 --> 06:27:45.759
Caption: in the era of remote work is that not

06:27:43.519 --> 06:27:47.279
Caption: really an issue

06:27:45.759 --> 06:27:48.558
Caption: yeah we were talking about this last

06:27:47.279 --> 06:27:51.119
Caption: night i

06:27:48.558 --> 06:27:52.160
Caption: i&#39;m incredibly biased on this though in

06:27:51.119 --> 06:27:54.556
Caption: that i

06:27:52.160 --> 06:27:57.041
Caption: don&#39;t think that the perth sector

06:27:54.558 --> 06:27:59.361
Caption: if there is if there are gaps and i&#39;m

06:27:57.039 --> 06:28:00.876
Caption: sure people can identify them i don&#39;t

06:27:59.359 --> 06:28:03.919
Caption: think that there&#39;s anything lacking in

06:28:00.878 --> 06:28:06.160
Caption: our capability or our capacity to grow

06:28:03.919 --> 06:28:10.160
Caption: and fill those gaps

06:28:06.160 --> 06:28:11.679
Caption: in terms of working remotely intopia is

06:28:10.160 --> 06:28:14.160
Caption: a fully distributed

06:28:11.679 --> 06:28:16.080
Caption: organization so i&#39;m the only employee in

06:28:14.160 --> 06:28:18.798
Caption: perth but we have people all around

06:28:16.080 --> 06:28:20.000
Caption: australia in new zealand in america and

06:28:18.798 --> 06:28:21.041
Caption: in canada

06:28:20.000 --> 06:28:23.439
Caption: and

06:28:21.039 --> 06:28:25.199
Caption: in general we&#39;ve found

06:28:23.439 --> 06:28:27.679
Caption: the quality of people

06:28:25.199 --> 06:28:29.279
Caption: that we find to be pretty similar all

06:28:27.679 --> 06:28:31.759
Caption: around so

06:28:29.279 --> 06:28:35.759
Caption: again i&#39;m the only one in perth

06:28:31.759 --> 06:28:37.679
Caption: until loren came to visit us so um

06:28:35.759 --> 06:28:40.558
Caption: yeah i might be incredibly biased on

06:28:37.679 --> 06:28:42.400
Caption: that but i do think that there is a lot

06:28:40.558 --> 06:28:45.281
Caption: of strength and a lot of resilience and

06:28:42.400 --> 06:28:47.679
Caption: creativity in perth so

06:28:45.279 --> 06:28:50.318
Caption: if there&#39;s any particular

06:28:47.679 --> 06:28:52.558
Caption: language sets or skill sets that are

06:28:50.320 --> 06:28:54.878
Caption: missing i think that&#39;s just a case of

06:28:52.558 --> 06:28:56.798
Caption: okay fine we identify them and we fill

06:28:54.878 --> 06:28:58.400
Caption: those gaps

06:28:56.798 --> 06:29:01.841
Caption: but i&#39;ll pass over to people who are

06:28:58.400 --> 06:29:01.839
Caption: possibly less biased

06:29:02.160 --> 06:29:06.000
Caption: yeah i think it&#39;s

06:29:04.558 --> 06:29:07.919
Caption: sort of just a function of our

06:29:06.000 --> 06:29:10.080
Caption: population really so i think we&#39;ve got

06:29:07.919 --> 06:29:11.119
Caption: everything just in smaller amounts and

06:29:10.080 --> 06:29:12.478
Caption: so

06:29:11.119 --> 06:29:13.439
Caption: um

06:29:12.478 --> 06:29:16.240
Caption: like

06:29:13.439 --> 06:29:19.359
Caption: ddd for me is one of those little sparks

06:29:16.240 --> 06:29:21.439
Caption: in the the perth sort of tech scene

06:29:19.359 --> 06:29:23.119
Caption: um

06:29:21.439 --> 06:29:25.199
Caption: i&#39;d love to see more investment in tech

06:29:23.119 --> 06:29:28.158
Caption: and more startups and growth here and

06:29:25.199 --> 06:29:29.599
Caption: more conferences like this one

06:29:28.160 --> 06:29:30.878
Caption: but yeah i don&#39;t think there&#39;s any

06:29:29.599 --> 06:29:32.320
Caption: fundamental

06:29:30.878 --> 06:29:33.921
Caption: lack of skills i just think it&#39;s a

06:29:32.320 --> 06:29:35.359
Caption: functionality sorry just a function of

06:29:33.919 --> 06:29:37.919
Caption: us being

06:29:35.359 --> 06:29:41.716
Caption: comparatively small and in a relatively

06:29:37.919 --> 06:29:41.718
Caption: isolated part of the world

06:29:42.400 --> 06:29:46.000
Caption: okay so we&#39;ve got about five minutes

06:29:44.160 --> 06:29:48.958
Caption: left i&#39;m going to jump around to a few

06:29:46.000 --> 06:29:52.080
Caption: fun ones here that i&#39;ve got in the list

06:29:48.957 --> 06:29:53.759
Caption: what&#39;s a boring technology that people

06:29:52.080 --> 06:29:55.759
Caption: or companies should use more forget

06:29:53.759 --> 06:29:57.279
Caption: about web3 and blockchain for a moment

06:29:55.759 --> 06:29:58.080
Caption: what&#39;s something boring we should look

06:29:57.279 --> 06:30:00.160
Caption: at

06:29:58.080 --> 06:30:03.199
Caption: i&#39;m raising my mic to my mouth to get in

06:30:00.160 --> 06:30:03.199
Caption: first html

06:30:03.599 --> 06:30:10.556
Caption: um it&#39;s the handy dandy go anywhere

06:30:07.439 --> 06:30:13.119
Caption: do anything kind of swiss army knife

06:30:10.558 --> 06:30:16.478
Caption: as far as boring tech goes html is

06:30:13.119 --> 06:30:17.839
Caption: actually pretty bloody great

06:30:16.478 --> 06:30:19.599
Caption: okay i&#39;ll

06:30:17.839 --> 06:30:20.558
Caption: throw out one um

06:30:19.599 --> 06:30:23.119
Caption: any

06:30:20.558 --> 06:30:25.201
Caption: any of the languages that are used for

06:30:23.119 --> 06:30:28.957
Caption: infrastructure as code so cloud

06:30:25.199 --> 06:30:28.957
Caption: formation does anyone like yaml

06:30:29.119 --> 06:30:32.238
Caption: hcl for terraform

06:30:31.119 --> 06:30:35.599
Caption: i don&#39;t know i&#39;m probably going to get

06:30:32.240 --> 06:30:35.599
Caption: murdered by a few people after this

06:30:35.759 --> 06:30:40.160
Caption: those kinds of things but we need to do

06:30:37.039 --> 06:30:40.158
Caption: more infrastructure as code

06:30:40.400 --> 06:30:44.240
Caption: for me

06:30:41.599 --> 06:30:45.279
Caption: i don&#39;t like sql

06:30:44.240 --> 06:30:47.279
Caption: i said

06:30:45.279 --> 06:30:50.716
Caption: i know people will

06:30:47.279 --> 06:30:50.716
Caption: disagree with me but for me

06:30:51.199 --> 06:30:56.160
Caption: when i have an interview and people ask

06:30:52.798 --> 06:30:59.601
Caption: me my skill or sql and i can do other

06:30:56.160 --> 06:31:02.000
Caption: things using other language and i don&#39;t

06:30:59.599 --> 06:31:04.160
Caption: like sql and also it&#39;s an indicator for

06:31:02.000 --> 06:31:06.080
Caption: me that would be a very boring and very

06:31:04.160 --> 06:31:08.478
Caption: dirty job i&#39;m more doing the cleaning

06:31:06.080 --> 06:31:12.160
Caption: more than doing the machine learning so

06:31:08.478 --> 06:31:12.160
Caption: sql for me is the keyword

06:31:14.478 --> 06:31:20.478
Caption: okay has anyone got a fun war story to

06:31:17.679 --> 06:31:23.759
Caption: share from the last year

06:31:20.478 --> 06:31:23.759
Caption: in what context

06:31:26.240 --> 06:31:31.878
Caption: not any that my clients would be happy

06:31:28.080 --> 06:31:31.878
Caption: for me to have recorded

06:31:34.558 --> 06:31:38.320
Caption: many war stories but none that are fun

06:31:39.199 --> 06:31:42.556
Caption: i think i think we&#39;ve all been there

06:31:41.759 --> 06:31:44.558
Caption: okay

06:31:42.558 --> 06:31:46.878
Caption: uh

06:31:44.558 --> 06:31:48.478
Caption: well here&#39;s a uh here&#39;s something that&#39;s

06:31:46.878 --> 06:31:50.400
Caption: a little bit different

06:31:48.478 --> 06:31:53.201
Caption: what is the meaning of life as a

06:31:50.400 --> 06:31:56.638
Caption: developer in your eyes and bearing in

06:31:53.199 --> 06:31:57.759
Caption: mind that we all know the answer is 42

06:31:56.638 --> 06:31:59.441
Caption: what else

06:31:57.759 --> 06:32:02.400
Caption: do you think the meaning of life as a

06:31:59.439 --> 06:32:04.876
Caption: developer is christina yes i&#39;m super

06:32:02.400 --> 06:32:07.041
Caption: excited to answer this i work really

06:32:04.878 --> 06:32:09.601
Caption: really hard with my mentees to teach

06:32:07.039 --> 06:32:12.398
Caption: them creative problem solving because

06:32:09.599 --> 06:32:14.636
Caption: it&#39;s all about critical thinking and

06:32:12.400 --> 06:32:17.599
Caption: solving problems a lot of times

06:32:14.638 --> 06:32:19.919
Caption: the people that i work with just enjoy

06:32:17.599 --> 06:32:21.439
Caption: working on things and chewing on things

06:32:19.919 --> 06:32:24.080
Caption: and a lot of times they like the

06:32:21.439 --> 06:32:27.839
Caption: accolades as well and

06:32:24.080 --> 06:32:30.160
Caption: for me i try to help shift them to the

06:32:27.839 --> 06:32:32.478
Caption: empathetic side right i&#39;m the emotional

06:32:30.160 --> 06:32:34.000
Caption: intelligence woman so i&#39;m always looking

06:32:32.478 --> 06:32:36.638
Caption: at how we connect our products and

06:32:34.000 --> 06:32:40.558
Caption: services with empathy with

06:32:36.638 --> 06:32:43.601
Caption: kindness and with innovation to to the

06:32:40.558 --> 06:32:45.441
Caption: people that are using them and

06:32:43.599 --> 06:32:48.080
Caption: i try to

06:32:45.439 --> 06:32:50.160
Caption: impart into people that those creative

06:32:48.080 --> 06:32:53.439
Caption: problem-solving skills those thinking

06:32:50.160 --> 06:32:56.558
Caption: skills that often come so naturally to

06:32:53.439 --> 06:32:59.039
Caption: people in our industry and they&#39;re very

06:32:56.558 --> 06:33:00.160
Caption: very valuable and you can sometimes just

06:32:59.039 --> 06:33:01.679
Caption: take that for granted because you&#39;re

06:33:00.160 --> 06:33:04.478
Caption: surrounded with other people who are

06:33:01.679 --> 06:33:06.320
Caption: doing that but if you think about the

06:33:04.478 --> 06:33:09.441
Caption: those problem-solving skills that you

06:33:06.320 --> 06:33:10.798
Caption: have and how you can use the tools to

06:33:09.439 --> 06:33:13.199
Caption: really

06:33:10.798 --> 06:33:15.281
Caption: work on solving some of these difficult

06:33:13.199 --> 06:33:19.839
Caption: challenging problems of the world that

06:33:15.279 --> 06:33:19.839
Caption: has a deep and and greater purpose

06:33:21.199 --> 06:33:25.919
Caption: that&#39;s a fantastic answer so i&#39;m gonna

06:33:23.439 --> 06:33:27.919
Caption: i&#39;m gonna end on one i&#39;m gonna ask um

06:33:25.919 --> 06:33:29.839
Caption: each of our panelists this question

06:33:27.919 --> 06:33:32.400
Caption: uh because it is the most popular

06:33:29.839 --> 06:33:33.599
Caption: question on left on the app right now

06:33:32.400 --> 06:33:34.558
Caption: we&#39;ve covered a little bit already so

06:33:33.599 --> 06:33:37.039
Caption: i&#39;m going to

06:33:34.558 --> 06:33:39.041
Caption: i&#39;m going to riffle a little bit so the

06:33:37.039 --> 06:33:41.919
Caption: original question asks what&#39;s the hype

06:33:39.039 --> 06:33:44.876
Caption: with web3 it feels like it&#39;s a waste of

06:33:41.919 --> 06:33:47.359
Caption: time and money and has no value

06:33:44.878 --> 06:33:49.521
Caption: i&#39;ll extend that a little bit

06:33:47.359 --> 06:33:51.279
Caption: one of the things we criticize about as

06:33:49.519 --> 06:33:55.199
Caption: technologists is we get distracted by

06:33:51.279 --> 06:33:57.039
Caption: the next sort of shiny thing how do we

06:33:55.199 --> 06:33:58.636
Caption: distinguish the next shiny thing from

06:33:57.039 --> 06:34:00.318
Caption: something that actually has value how do

06:33:58.638 --> 06:34:02.878
Caption: we actually dig in and understand

06:34:00.320 --> 06:34:04.240
Caption: whether that has value uh sam i&#39;ll start

06:34:02.878 --> 06:34:06.240
Caption: with you and then we&#39;ll go around the

06:34:04.240 --> 06:34:09.839
Caption: panel

06:34:06.240 --> 06:34:09.839
Caption: that&#39;s a very good question um

06:34:10.000 --> 06:34:14.400
Caption: i&#39;d like to believe that everything has

06:34:12.000 --> 06:34:16.558
Caption: value and that the current form is

06:34:14.400 --> 06:34:18.160
Caption: likely to change over time but there are

06:34:16.558 --> 06:34:20.638
Caption: some underlying principles and so it&#39;s

06:34:18.160 --> 06:34:22.798
Caption: really just finding that sort of almost

06:34:20.638 --> 06:34:25.759
Caption: like product market fit where there&#39;s an

06:34:22.798 --> 06:34:26.798
Caption: evolution and so what we see now

06:34:25.759 --> 06:34:29.519
Caption: is

06:34:26.798 --> 06:34:30.958
Caption: might be hard to really

06:34:29.519 --> 06:34:32.796
Caption: understand what it&#39;s going to look like

06:34:30.957 --> 06:34:34.876
Caption: in the future but i wouldn&#39;t be

06:34:32.798 --> 06:34:36.798
Caption: surprised if we we see

06:34:34.878 --> 06:34:38.878
Caption: something that resembles not the web 3

06:34:36.798 --> 06:34:41.041
Caption: of today but

06:34:38.878 --> 06:34:42.638
Caption: you know a particular application

06:34:41.039 --> 06:34:44.078
Caption: going forward but certainly right now i

06:34:42.638 --> 06:34:47.759
Caption: can understand why people would be

06:34:44.080 --> 06:34:47.759
Caption: feeling a bit dubious about it

06:34:48.957 --> 06:34:54.158
Caption: i definitely agree with sam about the

06:34:52.080 --> 06:34:57.279
Caption: port and market fit and then adding

06:34:54.160 --> 06:35:00.478
Caption: value to the problem but that means we

06:34:57.279 --> 06:35:02.636
Caption: actually really need the domain expert

06:35:00.478 --> 06:35:04.240
Caption: to understand the problem and apply the

06:35:02.638 --> 06:35:05.521
Caption: technology

06:35:04.240 --> 06:35:08.478
Caption: is a

06:35:05.519 --> 06:35:11.519
Caption: should be a second secondary rather than

06:35:08.478 --> 06:35:14.718
Caption: the primary we should more always focus

06:35:11.519 --> 06:35:18.240
Caption: on solving the problem and add value to

06:35:14.718 --> 06:35:20.958
Caption: the situation the tet is shiny and next

06:35:18.240 --> 06:35:22.958

06:35:20.957 --> 06:35:25.519
Caption: we learned today may be not applicable

06:35:22.957 --> 06:35:27.839
Caption: in couple years so don&#39;t hang on to the

06:35:25.519 --> 06:35:29.759
Caption: technology focused on the problem and

06:35:27.839 --> 06:35:31.679
Caption: solving it

06:35:29.759 --> 06:35:32.796
Caption: i think there is a

06:35:31.679 --> 06:35:36.160
Caption: small

06:35:32.798 --> 06:35:39.361
Caption: part of the community that is going to

06:35:36.160 --> 06:35:41.519
Caption: enjoy spending time with their their

06:35:39.359 --> 06:35:43.679
Caption: goggles on right and there are already

06:35:41.519 --> 06:35:45.439
Caption: people in the metaverse who really

06:35:43.679 --> 06:35:47.119
Caption: like certain things and and that&#39;s where

06:35:45.439 --> 06:35:48.876
Caption: they find connection and that&#39;s great

06:35:47.119 --> 06:35:51.599
Caption: and it&#39;s a certain subset of the

06:35:48.878 --> 06:35:53.681
Caption: population and so i think

06:35:51.599 --> 06:35:56.080
Caption: for that it does have value right for

06:35:53.679 --> 06:35:58.240
Caption: people who it&#39;s valuable if you have

06:35:56.080 --> 06:36:00.638
Caption: skins if you if you can buy certain

06:35:58.240 --> 06:36:02.558
Caption: things if you can have okay yeah we want

06:36:00.638 --> 06:36:04.798
Caption: to put some effort i can understand how

06:36:02.558 --> 06:36:07.281
Caption: companies want to do marketing within

06:36:04.798 --> 06:36:09.281
Caption: the metaverse and stuff like that i get

06:36:07.279 --> 06:36:12.876
Caption: it but you know the reality is is that

06:36:09.279 --> 06:36:15.919
Caption: it&#39;s like 10 000 people own a third of

06:36:12.878 --> 06:36:18.000
Caption: the crypto and i mean at that point and

06:36:15.919 --> 06:36:20.957
Caption: and there&#39;s something like

06:36:18.000 --> 06:36:23.839
Caption: 50 of the wallet keys are lost like you

06:36:20.957 --> 06:36:26.078
Caption: never will ever see them again and so

06:36:23.839 --> 06:36:27.599
Caption: with that level there&#39;s really it&#39;s it&#39;s

06:36:26.080 --> 06:36:30.240
Caption: not really practical

06:36:27.599 --> 06:36:32.957
Caption: for like me what&#39;s what&#39;s the the

06:36:30.240 --> 06:36:35.439
Caption: motivation for me to get into that when

06:36:32.957 --> 06:36:37.359
Caption: there&#39;s there&#39;s 10 000

06:36:35.439 --> 06:36:39.359
Caption: people who are already gonna hold it

06:36:37.359 --> 06:36:41.119
Caption: there is a small percentage of the

06:36:39.359 --> 06:36:42.957
Caption: population that&#39;s holding it and then

06:36:41.119 --> 06:36:45.759
Caption: what happens is we end up having all of

06:36:42.957 --> 06:36:47.919
Caption: these other kids again who can&#39;t afford

06:36:45.759 --> 06:36:49.839

06:36:47.919 --> 06:36:51.839
Caption: spending a lot of money and they&#39;re

06:36:49.839 --> 06:36:54.240
Caption: doing it wrong you can do it right

06:36:51.839 --> 06:36:56.240

06:37:02.718 --> 06:37:09.761
Caption: um i i have other people who are

06:37:06.558 --> 06:37:12.878
Caption: using it to their advantage for testing

06:37:09.759 --> 06:37:15.439
Caption: things or for um training during remote

06:37:12.878 --> 06:37:18.000
Caption: teams um you know that&#39;s that&#39;s a good

06:37:15.439 --> 06:37:19.919
Caption: use of it will it take over our future

06:37:18.000 --> 06:37:21.679
Caption: and oh my gosh everybody&#39;s going to be

06:37:19.919 --> 06:37:23.119

06:37:21.679 --> 06:37:26.160
Caption: next shiny thing

06:37:23.119 --> 06:37:28.556
Caption: no i i don&#39;t think so no

06:37:26.160 --> 06:37:29.359
Caption: i yeah tend to agree with everybody here

06:37:28.558 --> 06:37:30.400
Caption: um

06:37:29.359 --> 06:37:33.199
Caption: my own

06:37:30.400 --> 06:37:35.201
Caption: thinking on this is very much about how

06:37:33.199 --> 06:37:38.636
Caption: when i first started learning to make

06:37:35.199 --> 06:37:40.636
Caption: websites it was very much like i can i

06:37:38.638 --> 06:37:42.558
Caption: have i can make a thing and put it out

06:37:40.638 --> 06:37:44.320
Caption: in the world and other people can just

06:37:42.558 --> 06:37:46.878
Caption: show up and look at it and we don&#39;t need

06:37:44.320 --> 06:37:48.478
Caption: rupert murdoch&#39;s permission to do so

06:37:46.878 --> 06:37:50.798
Caption: a lot of the

06:37:48.478 --> 06:37:52.718
Caption: extra hype comes from people inserting

06:37:50.798 --> 06:37:56.080
Caption: themselves as a middleman in a process

06:37:52.718 --> 06:37:59.041
Caption: so that they can extract a profit

06:37:56.080 --> 06:38:00.798
Caption: i think the real longevity and promise

06:37:59.039 --> 06:38:03.119
Caption: of

06:38:00.798 --> 06:38:04.958
Caption: computing and software and the internet

06:38:03.119 --> 06:38:06.716
Caption: comes from those underlying patterns and

06:38:04.957 --> 06:38:10.199
Caption: principles of

06:38:06.718 --> 06:38:12.798
Caption: openness transparency

06:38:10.199 --> 06:38:14.160
Caption: interoperability and so if those are the

06:38:12.798 --> 06:38:15.761
Caption: patterns and principles that you&#39;re

06:38:14.160 --> 06:38:16.798
Caption: working with and then you learn a

06:38:15.759 --> 06:38:19.039
Caption: language

06:38:16.798 --> 06:38:20.718
Caption: that lets you work with that to solve

06:38:19.039 --> 06:38:23.359
Caption: the problem that you have

06:38:20.718 --> 06:38:24.958
Caption: and then some business people can come

06:38:23.359 --> 06:38:26.876
Caption: along and think about market

06:38:24.957 --> 06:38:28.796
Caption: propositions or something maybe that&#39;s

06:38:26.878 --> 06:38:31.441
Caption: just i&#39;m just too much of a nerd to care

06:38:28.798 --> 06:38:33.201
Caption: about that

06:38:31.439 --> 06:38:35.039
Caption: i&#39;m lucky to have one of one of my

06:38:33.199 --> 06:38:36.318
Caption: bosses cares about that very much and he

06:38:35.039 --> 06:38:38.078
Caption: thinks about that and i don&#39;t have to

06:38:36.320 --> 06:38:39.599
Caption: worry about it

06:38:38.080 --> 06:38:41.839
Caption: but i think

06:38:39.599 --> 06:38:43.199
Caption: if anyone is thinking about how do you

06:38:41.839 --> 06:38:44.957
Caption: getting back to that question about how

06:38:43.199 --> 06:38:47.519
Caption: do you decide between

06:38:44.957 --> 06:38:49.759
Caption: what&#39;s worth your time learning versus

06:38:47.519 --> 06:38:52.476
Caption: what&#39;s going to be a flash in the pan

06:38:49.759 --> 06:38:53.599
Caption: i think i will recommend

06:38:52.478 --> 06:38:57.041

06:45:55.119 --> 06:45:58.556
Caption: and she&#39;s here to tell us about what

06:45:56.718 --> 06:46:00.400
Caption: video games have taught her about

06:45:58.558 --> 06:46:03.638
Caption: designing for motivation so please give

06:46:00.400 --> 06:46:03.638
Caption: her a hand

06:46:06.798 --> 06:46:10.958

Caption: views not that representing where i work

06:46:24.000 --> 06:46:27.839
Caption: because i have now just finished up at

06:46:25.519 --> 06:46:28.556

06:46:27.839 --> 06:46:30.240

06:46:45.119 --> 06:46:49.279
Caption: like scitec

06:46:46.878 --> 06:46:51.281
Caption: and so i have a bit of a

06:46:49.279 --> 06:46:52.398
Caption: varied background

06:46:51.279 --> 06:46:54.318
Caption: hence my

06:46:52.400 --> 06:46:56.718
Caption: that is why my twitter handle is the way

06:46:54.320 --> 06:46:56.718
Caption: it is

06:46:56.957 --> 06:47:02.318
Caption: i wanted to start the talk with a little

06:47:00.160 --> 06:47:04.878
Caption: thought experiment if i

06:47:02.320 --> 06:47:07.359

Caption: slathered piece of vegemite toast

06:47:07.359 --> 06:47:11.359
Caption: not my ideal ratio of vegemite to bread

06:47:10.240 --> 06:47:13.439
Caption: or toast

06:47:11.359 --> 06:47:15.199
Caption: uh hands up just a show of hands how

06:47:13.439 --> 06:47:16.160
Caption: many people would be quite happy to come

06:47:15.199 --> 06:47:19.039
Caption: and eat

06:47:16.160 --> 06:47:20.320
Caption: this lovely piece of vegemite toast ah

06:47:19.039 --> 06:47:22.876
Caption: quite a few

06:47:20.320 --> 06:47:24.000
Caption: keep your hands up what about if i now

06:47:22.878 --> 06:47:26.000
Caption: offered you

06:47:24.000 --> 06:47:27.919
Caption: five dollars to come and eat this piece

06:47:26.000 --> 06:47:30.638
Caption: of vegemite toast anyone willing for

06:47:27.919 --> 06:47:33.519
Caption: five dollars what about

06:47:30.638 --> 06:47:35.601
Caption: fifty dollars

06:47:33.519 --> 06:47:36.716
Caption: okay if you want two hundred

06:47:35.599 --> 06:47:38.478
Caption: there&#39;s a few people still with their

06:47:36.718 --> 06:47:39.761
Caption: hands down but i&#39;m sure you have a price

06:47:38.478 --> 06:47:42.080
Caption: in mind to

06:47:39.759 --> 06:47:45.119
Caption: you know withstand the very polarizing

06:47:42.080 --> 06:47:46.638
Caption: taste of vegemite

06:47:45.119 --> 06:47:48.398
Caption: i wanted to use this as an example

06:47:46.638 --> 06:47:50.000
Caption: because it&#39;s a really good love hate

06:47:48.400 --> 06:47:52.000
Caption: relationship

06:47:50.000 --> 06:47:54.798
Caption: and some people are more than happy to

06:47:52.000 --> 06:47:58.320
Caption: eat vegemite for fun others need

06:47:54.798 --> 06:47:59.121
Caption: a bit of a different type of motivation

06:47:58.320 --> 06:48:00.798
Caption: so

06:47:59.119 --> 06:48:04.318
Caption: things we do for fun

06:48:00.798 --> 06:48:06.160
Caption: we have internal or intrinsic motivation

06:48:04.320 --> 06:48:08.240
Caption: things that

06:48:06.160 --> 06:48:11.199
Caption: we might not do for fun maybe we need a

06:48:08.240 --> 06:48:14.000
Caption: bit of reward like money

06:48:11.199 --> 06:48:16.398
Caption: that we call external or extrinsic

06:48:14.000 --> 06:48:19.199
Caption: motivation and we&#39;ll come back to those

06:48:16.400 --> 06:48:20.718
Caption: shortly so

06:48:19.199 --> 06:48:22.796
Caption: video games

06:48:20.718 --> 06:48:25.839
Caption: as a product or an industry

06:48:22.798 --> 06:48:26.798
Caption: is made for leisure and as a hobby

06:48:25.839 --> 06:48:28.718
Caption: so

06:48:26.798 --> 06:48:31.841
Caption: they have to be designed

06:48:28.718 --> 06:48:34.400
Caption: around intrinsic motivation and for fun

06:48:31.839 --> 06:48:36.876
Caption: so good ux or a good player experience

06:48:34.400 --> 06:48:39.919
Caption: is really core to

06:48:36.878 --> 06:48:41.201
Caption: the game as a product and doing well

06:48:39.919 --> 06:48:43.279
Caption: however

06:48:41.199 --> 06:48:46.080
Caption: coming into

06:48:43.279 --> 06:48:47.359
Caption: enterprise software or websites or apps

06:48:46.080 --> 06:48:49.439
Caption: sometimes

06:48:47.359 --> 06:48:52.556
Caption: good ux is a

06:48:49.439 --> 06:48:54.556
Caption: nice to have that&#39;s added on at the end

06:48:52.558 --> 06:48:57.839
Caption: and not the primary

06:48:54.558 --> 06:49:00.080
Caption: core of the experience

06:48:57.839 --> 06:49:02.240
Caption: but also to be fair we use them

06:49:00.080 --> 06:49:03.839
Caption: differently they&#39;re more like a tool we

06:49:02.240 --> 06:49:07.279
Caption: use to get a job done they&#39;re not

06:49:03.839 --> 06:49:09.119
Caption: necessarily there for leisure

06:49:07.279 --> 06:49:10.957
Caption: so

06:49:09.119 --> 06:49:13.839
Caption: comparing the two

06:49:10.957 --> 06:49:15.679
Caption: one being mostly intrinsic motivation

06:49:13.839 --> 06:49:16.876
Caption: and one being mostly extrinsic

06:49:15.679 --> 06:49:20.160
Caption: motivation

06:49:16.878 --> 06:49:22.400
Caption: how could we learn some lessons from the

06:49:20.160 --> 06:49:25.439
Caption: world of video games and apply them to

06:49:22.400 --> 06:49:28.080
Caption: enterprise software or websites or apps

06:49:25.439 --> 06:49:30.320
Caption: and i&#39;ll just pause here to say i&#39;m not

06:49:28.080 --> 06:49:32.718
Caption: going to be talking about gamification

06:49:30.320 --> 06:49:36.400
Caption: in turning these tools into games but

06:49:32.718 --> 06:49:36.400
Caption: more about how could we tweak them

06:49:36.718 --> 06:49:40.958
Caption: to be more intrinsically motivating so

06:49:39.439 --> 06:49:42.556
Caption: one of the series that i&#39;ve done a lot

06:49:40.957 --> 06:49:44.876
Caption: of work in and i won&#39;t bore you with it

06:49:42.558 --> 06:49:47.121
Caption: but basically the theory says that

06:49:44.878 --> 06:49:49.681
Caption: intrinsic motivation is made of three

06:49:47.119 --> 06:49:51.919
Caption: elements so there&#39;s autonomy which is a

06:49:49.679 --> 06:49:52.957
Caption: fancy way of saying you have choice and

06:49:51.919 --> 06:49:54.638
Caption: control

06:49:52.957 --> 06:49:57.279
Caption: over things

06:49:54.638 --> 06:49:59.441
Caption: competence which means you feel skilled

06:49:57.279 --> 06:50:01.679
Caption: at doing a particular activity or your

06:49:59.439 --> 06:50:03.039
Caption: skill is improving you don&#39;t have to be

06:50:01.679 --> 06:50:05.759
Caption: a master

06:50:03.039 --> 06:50:07.519
Caption: at the activity and

06:50:05.759 --> 06:50:09.119
Caption: relatedness which is feeling a

06:50:07.519 --> 06:50:11.119
Caption: connection to other people or a

06:50:09.119 --> 06:50:12.876
Caption: community of people so these three

06:50:11.119 --> 06:50:14.398
Caption: things combining together

06:50:12.878 --> 06:50:16.638
Caption: help make stuff

06:50:14.400 --> 06:50:18.958
Caption: really intrinsically motivating and fun

06:50:16.638 --> 06:50:18.958
Caption: to do

06:50:19.279 --> 06:50:23.599
Caption: you know being a now being working in

06:50:21.279 --> 06:50:25.359
Caption: design love a good how might we

06:50:23.599 --> 06:50:27.039
Caption: statement so

06:50:25.359 --> 06:50:28.796
Caption: having worked at ibm for a bit now i

06:50:27.039 --> 06:50:31.199
Caption: thought well how might we

06:50:28.798 --> 06:50:33.521
Caption: as a fun challenge design enterprise

06:50:31.199 --> 06:50:35.039
Caption: software to be more intrinsically

06:50:33.519 --> 06:50:35.919
Caption: motivating to use

06:50:35.039 --> 06:50:37.679
Caption: again

06:50:35.919 --> 06:50:41.359
Caption: without turning it into a game because

06:50:37.679 --> 06:50:41.359
Caption: it is meant to be a tool

06:50:41.519 --> 06:50:44.957
Caption: starting with our first element of

06:50:43.759 --> 06:50:47.199
Caption: autonomy

06:50:44.957 --> 06:50:48.556
Caption: games usually do this really well one

06:50:47.199 --> 06:50:52.238
Caption: good example

06:50:48.558 --> 06:50:54.878
Caption: of this is from competitive first person

06:50:52.240 --> 06:50:57.279
Caption: tutor games usually this is a screenshot

06:50:54.878 --> 06:51:00.000
Caption: from a fortnight menu

06:50:57.279 --> 06:51:02.796
Caption: where the game is allowing you to

06:51:00.000 --> 06:51:04.957
Caption: completely remap your controller you

06:51:02.798 --> 06:51:06.160
Caption: have complete control over which button

06:51:04.957 --> 06:51:07.919
Caption: does what

06:51:06.160 --> 06:51:09.599
Caption: so you can

06:51:07.919 --> 06:51:10.876
Caption: make it to your liking

06:51:09.599 --> 06:51:13.039
Caption: not all games do this but the

06:51:10.878 --> 06:51:14.558
Caption: competitive games usually have

06:51:13.039 --> 06:51:16.876
Caption: do this a bit better

06:51:14.558 --> 06:51:18.878
Caption: than others

06:51:16.878 --> 06:51:20.638
Caption: and a good example from

06:51:18.878 --> 06:51:22.400
Caption: other software that give you good choice

06:51:20.638 --> 06:51:25.441
Caption: and control

06:51:22.400 --> 06:51:28.160
Caption: is the adobe suite you can completely

06:51:25.439 --> 06:51:29.519
Caption: move the menus around change which icons

06:51:28.160 --> 06:51:31.439
Caption: are in your menu

06:51:29.519 --> 06:51:33.359
Caption: i&#39;m left-handed so if i was to do any

06:51:31.439 --> 06:51:34.476
Caption: drawing on a touch screen i&#39;d move all

06:51:33.359 --> 06:51:36.957
Caption: the menus

06:51:34.478 --> 06:51:38.478
Caption: to the right-hand side and it enables me

06:51:36.957 --> 06:51:41.199
Caption: to do that

06:51:38.478 --> 06:51:42.718
Caption: not all software does so that&#39;s one good

06:51:41.199 --> 06:51:45.599
Caption: example of offering

06:51:42.718 --> 06:51:47.441
Caption: choice and control in a non-game

06:51:45.599 --> 06:51:50.160
Caption: scenario

06:51:47.439 --> 06:51:51.279
Caption: another great one is slack and a lot of

06:51:50.160 --> 06:51:53.839
Caption: other

06:51:51.279 --> 06:51:55.359
Caption: software has a light in the dark mode

06:51:53.839 --> 06:51:57.279
Caption: slack goes a little bit further with the

06:51:55.359 --> 06:51:58.636
Caption: different color modes

06:51:57.279 --> 06:52:00.398
Caption: and if you actually scroll all the way

06:51:58.638 --> 06:52:02.400
Caption: to the bottom

06:52:00.400 --> 06:52:04.478
Caption: dawn mentioned this in her accessibility

06:52:02.400 --> 06:52:06.478
Caption: talk this morning as well

06:52:04.478 --> 06:52:07.441
Caption: but there are actually

06:52:06.478 --> 06:52:09.759
Caption: a few

06:52:07.439 --> 06:52:11.039
Caption: color schemes specifically designed for

06:52:09.759 --> 06:52:12.240
Caption: people with different types of color

06:52:11.039 --> 06:52:13.599
Caption: blindness

06:52:12.240 --> 06:52:15.359
Caption: and

06:52:13.599 --> 06:52:18.000
Caption: offering choice and control over things

06:52:15.359 --> 06:52:19.359
Caption: that might seem like a really small

06:52:18.000 --> 06:52:21.919
Caption: deal to you

06:52:19.359 --> 06:52:24.080
Caption: can have a really great added benefit of

06:52:21.919 --> 06:52:26.000
Caption: improving accessibility for some of your

06:52:24.080 --> 06:52:28.400
Caption: other users that you might not even

06:52:26.000 --> 06:52:30.957
Caption: recognize when you first add this

06:52:28.400 --> 06:52:30.958
Caption: feature in

06:52:31.199 --> 06:52:35.199
Caption: moving on to our

06:52:32.638 --> 06:52:36.958
Caption: second strand which is competence

06:52:35.199 --> 06:52:38.476
Caption: lots of video games

06:52:36.957 --> 06:52:40.000
Caption: do this really well as well because they

06:52:38.478 --> 06:52:43.121
Caption: essentially have to teach you how to use

06:52:40.000 --> 06:52:43.119
Caption: the game while you&#39;re in the game

06:52:43.519 --> 06:52:48.000
Caption: one of my favorite games that i&#39;ve done

06:52:45.199 --> 06:52:50.000
Caption: used in my research which was really fun

06:52:48.000 --> 06:52:52.878
Caption: is called untitled goose game the

06:52:50.000 --> 06:52:55.679
Caption: premise is that you are a mischievous

06:52:52.878 --> 06:52:56.958
Caption: goose running around an english village

06:52:55.679 --> 06:52:59.199
Caption: causing mayhem

06:52:56.957 --> 06:53:00.716
Caption: so in each section of the village you

06:52:59.199 --> 06:53:03.359
Caption: get a to-do list

06:53:00.718 --> 06:53:04.798
Caption: and as you complete the to-do list it

06:53:03.359 --> 06:53:06.796
Caption: crosses off

06:53:04.798 --> 06:53:09.441
Caption: that action and different tasks are more

06:53:06.798 --> 06:53:11.041
Caption: difficult than others

06:53:09.439 --> 06:53:12.876
Caption: so when you go shopping if you put the

06:53:11.039 --> 06:53:15.039
Caption: toothbrush in the basket it will cross

06:53:12.878 --> 06:53:16.638
Caption: off the just the word toothbrush

06:53:15.039 --> 06:53:19.199
Caption: and if the toothbrush somehow comes out

06:53:16.638 --> 06:53:22.160
Caption: of the basket it uncrosses off as well

06:53:19.199 --> 06:53:25.199
Caption: so it&#39;s like reactive

06:53:22.160 --> 06:53:27.439
Caption: so games do quest logs missions and

06:53:25.199 --> 06:53:29.599
Caption: checklists like this

06:53:27.439 --> 06:53:31.919
Caption: really really really well

06:53:29.599 --> 06:53:33.519
Caption: and you feel a sense of progress like

06:53:31.919 --> 06:53:35.199
Caption: you&#39;ve achieved something

06:53:33.519 --> 06:53:36.716
Caption: also really handy like me if you haven&#39;t

06:53:35.199 --> 06:53:38.080

Caption: come back six months later and you can&#39;t

06:53:38.080 --> 06:53:42.320
Caption: remember what you&#39;re up to

06:53:39.839 --> 06:53:44.876
Caption: these quest logs and checklists can help

06:53:42.320 --> 06:53:47.121
Caption: you get oh that&#39;s right i was trying to

06:53:44.878 --> 06:53:49.761

Caption: one

06:53:56.400 --> 06:54:00.798
Caption: online course i was doing recently

06:53:59.039 --> 06:54:02.636
Caption: through the interaction design

06:54:00.798 --> 06:54:03.841
Caption: foundation i thought did this really

06:54:02.638 --> 06:54:05.281
Caption: well

06:54:03.839 --> 06:54:07.279
Caption: in their website all their courses

06:54:05.279 --> 06:54:08.476
Caption: follow this sort of layout so on the

06:54:07.279 --> 06:54:11.759
Caption: left here we&#39;ve got their clear

06:54:08.478 --> 06:54:14.400
Caption: progression of chapters or lessons

06:54:11.759 --> 06:54:16.160
Caption: within each lesson we&#39;ve got

06:54:14.400 --> 06:54:18.240
Caption: sub parts and as you complete them you

06:54:16.160 --> 06:54:20.320
Caption: get a nice green tick and as you end

06:54:18.240 --> 06:54:21.439
Caption: points by answering questions throughout

06:54:20.320 --> 06:54:23.281
Caption: the course

06:54:21.439 --> 06:54:26.000
Caption: the blue points sort of float up to the

06:54:23.279 --> 06:54:27.279
Caption: progress bar up the top there so you can

06:54:26.000 --> 06:54:28.957
Caption: clearly see

06:54:27.279 --> 06:54:30.796
Caption: how much you&#39;ve got left to go until you

06:54:28.957 --> 06:54:32.876
Caption: get the little course certificate so

06:54:30.798 --> 06:54:35.121
Caption: it&#39;s a nice visual reminder of the

06:54:32.878 --> 06:54:36.638
Caption: progress you&#39;ve made so far and as you

06:54:35.119 --> 06:54:38.080
Caption: get closer and closer to the end it

06:54:36.638 --> 06:54:39.601
Caption: becomes even more and more motivating

06:54:38.080 --> 06:54:42.478
Caption: because you&#39;re like oh just a few more

06:54:39.599 --> 06:54:42.478
Caption: points and i&#39;m finished

06:54:43.119 --> 06:54:47.919
Caption: and so yeah they&#39;re on the left um other

06:54:46.000 --> 06:54:50.478
Caption: places do this really well i liked the

06:54:47.919 --> 06:54:52.320
Caption: salonist example but i noticed udemy

06:54:50.478 --> 06:54:54.400
Caption: also does this really well they&#39;ll have

06:54:52.320 --> 06:54:56.958
Caption: a time indicator next to each step or

06:54:54.400 --> 06:54:58.400
Caption: segment especially if it&#39;s video based

06:54:56.957 --> 06:55:00.716
Caption: and that gives you a good indication of

06:54:58.400 --> 06:55:03.121
Caption: how difficult or how long the task is

06:55:00.718 --> 06:55:05.361
Caption: going to take so i know for me

06:55:03.119 --> 06:55:07.519
Caption: if i only have a half hour or so i&#39;m not

06:55:05.359 --> 06:55:09.119
Caption: going to start anything too complicated

06:55:07.519 --> 06:55:11.119
Caption: because i&#39;m not going to get it finished

06:55:09.119 --> 06:55:14.398
Caption: and by offering these sort of

06:55:11.119 --> 06:55:16.000
Caption: indicators of difficulty or time

06:55:14.400 --> 06:55:17.439
Caption: you can make a good judgment about

06:55:16.000 --> 06:55:20.558
Caption: whether you want to start that activity

06:55:17.439 --> 06:55:20.556
Caption: now or not

06:55:21.519 --> 06:55:25.519
Caption: a bad example

06:55:23.439 --> 06:55:27.279
Caption: as a researcher i like doing other

06:55:25.519 --> 06:55:28.716
Caption: people&#39;s surveys to see

06:55:27.279 --> 06:55:31.279
Caption: what they&#39;ve done i had a professional

06:55:28.718 --> 06:55:33.601
Caption: interest i had an etsy survey pop up as

06:55:31.279 --> 06:55:37.759
Caption: i was browsing um you can see i was

06:55:33.599 --> 06:55:39.919
Caption: browsing pokemon plush toy thingos

06:55:37.759 --> 06:55:42.876
Caption: so i pressed sure i&#39;ll do your annoying

06:55:39.919 --> 06:55:44.558
Caption: pop-up survey and uh this was the first

06:55:42.878 --> 06:55:46.160
Caption: question but immediately i kind of

06:55:44.558 --> 06:55:47.759
Caption: noticed well i was in the middle of

06:55:46.160 --> 06:55:49.199
Caption: doing something

06:55:47.759 --> 06:55:50.638
Caption: i&#39;m doing you a favor and you&#39;re not

06:55:49.199 --> 06:55:52.238
Caption: telling me how long this is going to

06:55:50.638 --> 06:55:54.798
Caption: take

06:55:52.240 --> 06:55:56.478
Caption: no indication of progress and i&#39;ve used

06:55:54.798 --> 06:55:58.320
Caption: qualtrics before

06:55:56.478 --> 06:55:59.839
Caption: same with microsoft forms and i&#39;m sure

06:55:58.320 --> 06:56:02.080
Caption: many of the other ones there is always

06:55:59.839 --> 06:56:03.039
Caption: an option there to enable the progress

06:56:02.080 --> 06:56:04.558
Caption: bar

06:56:03.039 --> 06:56:06.078
Caption: which just puts a little bar at the top

06:56:04.558 --> 06:56:08.718
Caption: of the bottom to show you a percentage

06:56:06.080 --> 06:56:11.279
Caption: of how far through the survey you are

06:56:08.718 --> 06:56:13.521
Caption: just a small thing like that

06:56:11.279 --> 06:56:16.476
Caption: can help motivate people to complete the

06:56:13.519 --> 06:56:18.716
Caption: task same with retail websites and

06:56:16.478 --> 06:56:20.478
Caption: shopping checkout baskets you often see

06:56:18.718 --> 06:56:22.558
Caption: the steps

06:56:20.478 --> 06:56:24.240
Caption: listed or how close you are to finishing

06:56:22.558 --> 06:56:26.080
Caption: that purchase

06:56:24.240 --> 06:56:27.759
Caption: so about two or three questions in in my

06:56:26.080 --> 06:56:29.679
Caption: head and going i want to get back to

06:56:27.759 --> 06:56:32.000
Caption: what i was doing how much longer have i

06:56:29.679 --> 06:56:34.080
Caption: got left to go i want to quit this and

06:56:32.000 --> 06:56:35.279
Caption: just keep doing what i was doing

06:56:34.080 --> 06:56:37.119
Caption: i

06:56:35.279 --> 06:56:38.876
Caption: was just curious so i kept going and it

06:56:37.119 --> 06:56:39.839
Caption: was about five quick questions but i

06:56:38.878 --> 06:56:41.441
Caption: could see

06:56:39.839 --> 06:56:43.359
Caption: i imagine on the back end there&#39;d be

06:56:41.439 --> 06:56:45.919
Caption: quite a lot of churn or a lot of people

06:56:43.359 --> 06:56:47.279
Caption: dropping out after that second question

06:56:45.919 --> 06:56:50.400
Caption: because there&#39;s no indication of how

06:56:47.279 --> 06:56:50.398
Caption: long this thing is going for

06:56:50.957 --> 06:56:53.839
Caption: in our

06:56:52.080 --> 06:56:55.679
Caption: third stream which is

06:56:53.839 --> 06:56:56.876
Caption: uh an interesting one because we&#39;re

06:56:55.679 --> 06:56:58.957
Caption: talking about

06:56:56.878 --> 06:57:01.121
Caption: connection to other people and building

06:56:58.957 --> 06:57:01.919
Caption: community and immediately people think

06:57:01.119 --> 06:57:04.398
Caption: about

06:57:01.919 --> 06:57:06.400
Caption: that as being real time or multiplayer

06:57:04.400 --> 06:57:07.121
Caption: in the game sense but it doesn&#39;t have to

06:57:06.400 --> 06:57:08.798
Caption: be

06:57:07.119 --> 06:57:10.238
Caption: so i will start with a multiplayer game

06:57:08.798 --> 06:57:12.240
Caption: because that&#39;s the obvious

06:57:10.240 --> 06:57:15.279
Caption: uh i guess

06:57:12.240 --> 06:57:17.519
Caption: friendship building or breaking activity

06:57:15.279 --> 06:57:19.039
Caption: in video games um one of my favorite

06:57:17.519 --> 06:57:20.716
Caption: genres is called

06:57:19.039 --> 06:57:22.796
Caption: couch co-op

06:57:20.718 --> 06:57:24.320
Caption: this is one example called overcooked

06:57:22.798 --> 06:57:26.638
Caption: where you&#39;re working as a team of four

06:57:24.320 --> 06:57:29.121
Caption: to finish these orders in this level

06:57:26.638 --> 06:57:31.201
Caption: they&#39;re making burgers and usually the

06:57:29.119 --> 06:57:33.279
Caption: levels are set out in such a way that

06:57:31.199 --> 06:57:35.679
Caption: only certain people can do certain steps

06:57:33.279 --> 06:57:37.119
Caption: of the process so like a team where

06:57:35.679 --> 06:57:38.080
Caption: you&#39;ve got a dev and a designer and you

06:57:37.119 --> 06:57:39.839
Caption: can only

06:57:38.080 --> 06:57:41.759
Caption: no one person can do everything so

06:57:39.839 --> 06:57:44.160
Caption: you&#39;re having to yell at one another cop

06:57:41.759 --> 06:57:46.320
Caption: the stake what are you doing hurry up

06:57:44.160 --> 06:57:48.160
Caption: and pass me the tomatoes where&#39;s this

06:57:46.320 --> 06:57:50.080
Caption: where&#39;s it yeah so there&#39;s a lot of

06:57:48.160 --> 06:57:52.000
Caption: yelling but it&#39;s really fun and you&#39;re

06:57:50.080 --> 06:57:53.759
Caption: working in this game you&#39;re working to a

06:57:52.000 --> 06:57:55.759
Caption: clock so you have to do as many as

06:57:53.759 --> 06:57:58.000
Caption: possible in the time limit

06:57:55.759 --> 06:57:59.199
Caption: to pass the level so i find them really

06:57:58.000 --> 06:58:01.519
Caption: fun other people find them really

06:57:59.199 --> 06:58:03.199
Caption: stressful

06:58:01.519 --> 06:58:05.039
Caption: but that

06:58:03.199 --> 06:58:08.398
Caption: designing the levels in such a way that

06:58:05.039 --> 06:58:11.039
Caption: one person cannot do the level alone

06:58:08.400 --> 06:58:12.320
Caption: helps build that

06:58:11.039 --> 06:58:13.439
Caption: teamwork

06:58:12.320 --> 06:58:14.958
Caption: and

06:58:13.439 --> 06:58:16.636
Caption: one tool i&#39;ve been using a lot of

06:58:14.957 --> 06:58:17.759
Caption: recently that i think has a lot of

06:58:16.638 --> 06:58:19.361
Caption: features

06:58:17.759 --> 06:58:21.439
Caption: to make real-time

06:58:19.359 --> 06:58:23.119
Caption: collaboration online really good and

06:58:21.439 --> 06:58:25.839
Caption: there&#39;s lots of tools like this one this

06:58:23.119 --> 06:58:28.957
Caption: isn&#39;t the only one is mural it&#39;s like an

06:58:25.839 --> 06:58:31.439
Caption: online whiteboard where you can put fake

06:58:28.957 --> 06:58:33.759
Caption: digital sticky notes on there

06:58:31.439 --> 06:58:35.839
Caption: some of the features i like is that when

06:58:33.759 --> 06:58:37.519
Caption: you&#39;re all on the same mural you can see

06:58:35.839 --> 06:58:39.119
Caption: everyone&#39;s pointers it has their name

06:58:37.519 --> 06:58:40.240
Caption: next to it so you can clearly see where

06:58:39.119 --> 06:58:41.519
Caption: everyone is

06:58:40.240 --> 06:58:42.878
Caption: and what they&#39;re doing

06:58:41.519 --> 06:58:45.119
Caption: if you&#39;re a facilitator you have

06:58:42.878 --> 06:58:47.281
Caption: facilitator superpowers you can summon

06:58:45.119 --> 06:58:49.359
Caption: everyone to view what you&#39;re viewing on

06:58:47.279 --> 06:58:51.359
Caption: the screen

06:58:49.359 --> 06:58:53.599
Caption: you can lock things down so other people

06:58:51.359 --> 06:58:55.679
Caption: can&#39;t move and mess with your templates

06:58:53.599 --> 06:58:57.119
Caption: when you&#39;re doing brainstorming

06:58:55.679 --> 06:58:59.199
Caption: and so it has a lot of really really

06:58:57.119 --> 06:59:01.359
Caption: nice features to enable you to do that

06:58:59.199 --> 06:59:03.119
Caption: real-time stuff together really really

06:59:01.359 --> 06:59:04.080
Caption: well and

06:59:03.119 --> 06:59:06.000
Caption: again

06:59:04.080 --> 06:59:07.279
Caption: linking back to choice and control a lot

06:59:06.000 --> 06:59:08.798
Caption: of these features you can turn on and

06:59:07.279 --> 06:59:10.476
Caption: off if you

06:59:08.798 --> 06:59:12.558
Caption: made the mural yourself

06:59:10.478 --> 06:59:14.320
Caption: um so often a lot of clients i&#39;m working

06:59:12.558 --> 06:59:15.919
Caption: with are not have never used this tool

06:59:14.320 --> 06:59:18.160
Caption: before so

06:59:15.919 --> 06:59:20.718
Caption: we lock down a lot of things so they

06:59:18.160 --> 06:59:22.558
Caption: can&#39;t mess with it and

06:59:20.718 --> 06:59:24.558
Caption: yeah get them to follow our screen and

06:59:22.558 --> 06:59:27.679
Caption: guide them through the process so those

06:59:24.558 --> 06:59:29.679
Caption: features are really good for that

06:59:27.679 --> 06:59:32.636
Caption: another example of communication in

06:59:29.679 --> 06:59:34.796
Caption: games again this is a competitive

06:59:32.638 --> 06:59:36.718
Caption: first person sort of game but it&#39;s a

06:59:34.798 --> 06:59:38.000
Caption: team game so you&#39;re working on a team of

06:59:36.718 --> 06:59:40.000
Caption: five or six

06:59:38.000 --> 06:59:41.279
Caption: and a few other games also do this

06:59:40.000 --> 06:59:43.119
Caption: really well but i just couldn&#39;t find a

06:59:41.279 --> 06:59:45.119
Caption: good screenshot to show it

06:59:43.119 --> 06:59:46.080
Caption: so apex legends probably does this the

06:59:45.119 --> 06:59:49.279
Caption: best

06:59:46.080 --> 06:59:50.958
Caption: it&#39;s called a ping system where

06:59:49.279 --> 06:59:52.636
Caption: very quickly you have to communicate

06:59:50.957 --> 06:59:53.839
Caption: information very important information

06:59:52.638 --> 06:59:55.839
Caption: to your team

06:59:53.839 --> 06:59:58.400

Caption: standard menu of things and you can

07:00:00.400 --> 07:00:04.080
Caption: customize this menu as well but these

07:00:02.000 --> 07:00:05.679

07:00:04.080 --> 07:00:07.679

07:00:15.119 --> 07:00:19.519

07:00:17.759 --> 07:00:21.039
Caption: they will use a ping system quite a lot

07:00:19.519 --> 07:00:23.919
Caption: and they&#39;ll be very short and sharp with

07:00:21.039 --> 07:00:25.119

Caption: typing that message in

07:00:54.000 --> 07:00:57.919
Caption: one interesting example that i like

07:00:56.320 --> 07:01:00.400
Caption: bringing up a lot from video games as

07:00:57.919 --> 07:01:02.160
Caption: it&#39;s more asynchronous

07:01:00.400 --> 07:01:04.080

Caption: world

07:01:15.279 --> 07:01:19.039
Caption: and attach a message to that item and

07:01:17.439 --> 07:01:21.439
Caption: other players can then go and discover

07:01:19.039 --> 07:01:23.199
Caption: that item and read your message

07:01:21.439 --> 07:01:25.839
Caption: sometimes in dark souls players will

07:01:23.199 --> 07:01:28.398
Caption: leave clues about how to defeat next

07:01:25.839 --> 07:01:31.039
Caption: boss or watch out for a particular trap

07:01:28.400 --> 07:01:33.201
Caption: sometimes it&#39;s jokes sometimes it&#39;s

07:01:31.039 --> 07:01:35.279

07:01:33.199 --> 07:01:36.556
Caption: in a particular place sky&#39;s a bit more

07:01:35.279 --> 07:01:38.796
Caption: nice

07:01:36.558 --> 07:01:40.638
Caption: as a game it&#39;s not uh dark souls is

07:01:38.798 --> 07:01:43.361
Caption: pretty punishing

07:01:40.638 --> 07:01:45.201
Caption: um but it&#39;s this way that they build a

07:01:43.359 --> 07:01:47.279
Caption: sense of community and connection

07:01:45.199 --> 07:01:49.599
Caption: without it being real time

07:01:47.279 --> 07:01:51.359
Caption: and it&#39;s a single-player game often we

07:01:49.599 --> 07:01:54.478
Caption: think of single-player experiences as

07:01:51.359 --> 07:01:58.476
Caption: not being social whereas this is

07:01:54.478 --> 07:01:59.839

07:01:58.478 --> 07:02:01.839
Caption: i couldn&#39;t

07:01:59.839 --> 07:02:03.279
Caption: really it took me a while to think of an

07:02:01.839 --> 07:02:06.320
Caption: example from

07:02:03.279 --> 07:02:07.519
Caption: non-games but i do remember in having

07:02:06.320 --> 07:02:09.121

Caption: a service called gather content and

07:02:14.957 --> 07:02:18.876
Caption: essentially but i mean shared documents

07:02:16.878 --> 07:02:21.361
Caption: do this as well it was really easy for

07:02:18.878 --> 07:02:23.281
Caption: people to leave comments on my article

07:02:21.359 --> 07:02:24.957
Caption: asynchronously i could log in and then

07:02:23.279 --> 07:02:26.876
Caption: see what they had written and then go

07:02:24.957 --> 07:02:28.398
Caption: and make the relevant edits or changes

07:02:26.878 --> 07:02:31.041
Caption: that were requested

07:02:28.400 --> 07:02:32.958
Caption: same with shared google docs or online

07:02:31.039 --> 07:02:34.876
Caption: you know office 365

07:02:32.957 --> 07:02:36.876
Caption: documents it&#39;s

07:02:34.878 --> 07:02:38.558
Caption: i think this one is i see it being used

07:02:36.878 --> 07:02:40.638
Caption: more and more it&#39;s a great way to

07:02:38.558 --> 07:02:42.400
Caption: asynchronously work together on

07:02:40.638 --> 07:02:43.601
Caption: something without

07:02:42.400 --> 07:02:45.759
Caption: doing the

07:02:43.599 --> 07:02:48.796
Caption: um track changes in word which i find

07:02:45.759 --> 07:02:50.876
Caption: very painful um so gather content&#39;s a

07:02:48.798 --> 07:02:55.521
Caption: great example of that as well as just

07:02:50.878 --> 07:02:57.681
Caption: general shared collaborative documents

07:02:55.519 --> 07:02:59.199
Caption: i did want to spend

07:02:57.679 --> 07:03:00.558
Caption: two seconds quickly talking about

07:02:59.199 --> 07:03:02.796
Caption: competitive

07:03:00.558 --> 07:03:05.041
Caption: elements which often come up when people

07:03:02.798 --> 07:03:06.878
Caption: start talking about gamification so back

07:03:05.039 --> 07:03:09.279
Caption: to the interaction design foundation

07:03:06.878 --> 07:03:11.041
Caption: screen they do have a ranking of your

07:03:09.279 --> 07:03:12.876
Caption: score and i think if you get the max

07:03:11.039 --> 07:03:16.476
Caption: score for the course you can have

07:03:12.878 --> 07:03:16.478
Caption: multiple people sitting at first

07:03:16.798 --> 07:03:20.240
Caption: and it goes up as you get more points

07:03:19.439 --> 07:03:22.400
Caption: and

07:03:20.240 --> 07:03:23.439
Caption: the best i&#39;ve seen competitive done i

07:03:22.400 --> 07:03:25.201
Caption: guess

07:03:23.439 --> 07:03:28.240
Caption: in a

07:03:25.199 --> 07:03:30.636
Caption: gamey kind of sense is in a non

07:03:28.240 --> 07:03:32.558
Caption: game game is duolingo which is for

07:03:30.638 --> 07:03:34.320
Caption: learning languages

07:03:32.558 --> 07:03:35.919
Caption: what i liked about duolingo is that

07:03:34.320 --> 07:03:38.558
Caption: competitive things can be really

07:03:35.919 --> 07:03:40.320
Caption: demotivating if you&#39;re losing especially

07:03:38.558 --> 07:03:42.160
Caption: if you have no way

07:03:40.320 --> 07:03:44.160
Caption: to get back to the top to get back to

07:03:42.160 --> 07:03:46.798
Caption: winning so the way that you and lingo

07:03:44.160 --> 07:03:49.359
Caption: combat this is you get a lot of points

07:03:46.798 --> 07:03:50.638
Caption: just by participating number one great

07:03:49.359 --> 07:03:52.556
Caption: just for trying

07:03:50.638 --> 07:03:54.240
Caption: and that you can see that there&#39;s a

07:03:52.558 --> 07:03:56.718
Caption: limit on

07:03:54.240 --> 07:03:58.558
Caption: the leaderboard so i don&#39;t know what the

07:03:56.718 --> 07:03:59.601
Caption: time refresh time is maybe it&#39;s every

07:03:58.558 --> 07:04:01.361
Caption: week

07:03:59.599 --> 07:04:03.199
Caption: every week they&#39;ll refresh and restart

07:04:01.359 --> 07:04:05.279
Caption: the leaderboards from scratch so even if

07:04:03.199 --> 07:04:06.636
Caption: you were losing one week

07:04:05.279 --> 07:04:08.398
Caption: next week you&#39;re in with a whole nother

07:04:06.638 --> 07:04:10.718
Caption: shot so it&#39;s a lot more motivating to

07:04:08.400 --> 07:04:12.878
Caption: have that refreshing leaderboard

07:04:10.718 --> 07:04:16.478
Caption: and that ability to

07:04:12.878 --> 07:04:18.718
Caption: get back um to be potentially winning so

07:04:16.478 --> 07:04:20.958
Caption: i think use competitive or look at

07:04:18.718 --> 07:04:22.240
Caption: competitive elements with a real grain

07:04:20.957 --> 07:04:23.759
Caption: of salt because

07:04:22.240 --> 07:04:25.919
Caption: i think you always need to consider the

07:04:23.759 --> 07:04:29.039
Caption: losers how is it going to feel to be the

07:04:25.919 --> 07:04:30.798
Caption: loser is if there&#39;s low stakes that&#39;s

07:04:29.039 --> 07:04:32.796
Caption: better if there&#39;s high stakes it really

07:04:30.798 --> 07:04:36.160
Caption: sucks to be the loser is there any way

07:04:32.798 --> 07:04:37.601
Caption: for them to come back from losing or

07:04:36.160 --> 07:04:39.679
Caption: think about those things as well not

07:04:37.599 --> 07:04:41.119
Caption: just the winners motivation&#39;s really

07:04:39.679 --> 07:04:45.119
Caption: tricky when you start making it

07:04:41.119 --> 07:04:47.039
Caption: competitive versus collaborative

07:04:45.119 --> 07:04:49.359

07:41:23.919 --> 07:41:30.160
Caption: further and we try to inspire each other

07:41:27.039 --> 07:41:35.078
Caption: by learning new skills having new

07:41:30.160 --> 07:41:35.080
Caption: challenges and taking them and i think

07:41:36.160 --> 07:41:39.599
Caption: welcome back everybody

07:41:39.798 --> 07:41:43.201
Caption: welcome back

07:41:44.478 --> 07:41:49.599
Caption: just all of a sudden got very quiet

07:41:47.039 --> 07:41:53.439
Caption: welcome back everybody we are on to our

07:41:49.599 --> 07:41:54.636
Caption: last session for today which is our lock

07:41:53.439 --> 07:41:56.160
Caption: note

07:41:54.638 --> 07:42:01.441
Caption: so very shortly i&#39;m going to hand over

07:41:56.160 --> 07:42:02.478
Caption: to chris ferry so chris has a phd

07:42:01.439 --> 07:42:04.636
Caption: and does

07:42:02.478 --> 07:42:09.201
Caption: a lot of work in the science field

07:42:04.638 --> 07:42:11.919
Caption: however he also writes children&#39;s books

07:42:09.199 --> 07:42:15.519
Caption: now i had an opportunity to see chris

07:42:11.919 --> 07:42:16.638
Caption: speak at ddd brisbane a similar event on

07:42:15.519 --> 07:42:17.759
Caption: the other side of the country a few

07:42:16.638 --> 07:42:19.041
Caption: years ago

07:42:17.759 --> 07:42:22.320
Caption: and

07:42:19.039 --> 07:42:24.158
Caption: i was actually super impressed with the

07:42:22.320 --> 07:42:26.160
Caption: books and thought it was really amazing

07:42:24.160 --> 07:42:27.759
Caption: i got one of the books on blockchain so

07:42:26.160 --> 07:42:31.558
Caption: now i know everything about blockchain

07:42:27.759 --> 07:42:31.558
Caption: from blockchain for babies

07:42:31.679 --> 07:42:36.957
Caption: and i also want to say a huge thank you

07:42:34.320 --> 07:42:39.201
Caption: to chris uh who received an email from

07:42:36.957 --> 07:42:41.199
Caption: me on wednesday morning

07:42:39.199 --> 07:42:43.439
Caption: to see if he could come and give our

07:42:41.199 --> 07:42:44.876
Caption: keynotes this afternoon

07:42:43.439 --> 07:42:47.359
Caption: today

07:42:44.878 --> 07:42:49.121
Caption: so big thank you to chris

07:42:47.359 --> 07:42:51.599
Caption: for saving us at the last minute when we

07:42:49.119 --> 07:42:53.359
Caption: had a few travel difficulties so i&#39;m

07:42:51.599 --> 07:42:56.919
Caption: going to hand over to chris

07:42:53.359 --> 07:42:56.919
Caption: thank you very much

07:43:01.759 --> 07:43:07.679
Caption: yeah so thanks for the invite thanks for

07:43:03.919 --> 07:43:07.679
Caption: giving me lots of time to consider it

07:43:08.878 --> 07:43:12.558
Caption: um i was going to be here for the tattoo

07:43:10.878 --> 07:43:15.601
Caption: conference anyway so

07:43:12.558 --> 07:43:17.759
Caption: oh i thought i might as well come by

07:43:15.599 --> 07:43:19.679
Caption: yeah so i&#39;m chris ferry i&#39;m an associate

07:43:17.759 --> 07:43:20.876
Caption: professor at the

07:43:19.679 --> 07:43:22.320
Caption: center for quantum software and

07:43:20.878 --> 07:43:24.240
Caption: information at the university of

07:43:22.320 --> 07:43:25.359
Caption: technology sydney and that&#39;s obviously

07:43:24.240 --> 07:43:27.439
Caption: in sydney

07:43:25.359 --> 07:43:28.876
Caption: and i lead a research group and we do

07:43:27.439 --> 07:43:30.396
Caption: research in

07:43:28.878 --> 07:43:33.121
Caption: quantum machine learning

07:43:30.398 --> 07:43:34.320
Caption: and quantum control so we do like uh

07:43:33.119 --> 07:43:36.396
Caption: low-level

07:43:34.320 --> 07:43:39.041
Caption: stuff with quantum hardware and

07:43:36.398 --> 07:43:40.320
Caption: high-level kind of blue sky thinking

07:43:39.039 --> 07:43:42.000
Caption: about what we&#39;ll do with quantum

07:43:40.320 --> 07:43:45.679
Caption: computers in the future

07:43:42.000 --> 07:43:48.638
Caption: but i thought since i have you all here

07:43:45.679 --> 07:43:50.240
Caption: i&#39;ll just read you a story

07:43:48.638 --> 07:43:52.320
Caption: it&#39;s going to be a bit awkward for me to

07:43:50.240 --> 07:43:56.320
Caption: try to do this with the book so

07:43:52.320 --> 07:43:56.320
Caption: i&#39;ll just show you the book on screen

07:43:56.957 --> 07:44:00.396
Caption: i think i&#39;ll do that

07:44:00.638 --> 07:44:04.958
Caption: ah here we go

07:44:01.919 --> 07:44:07.359
Caption: okay here we go the cat in the box

07:44:04.957 --> 07:44:10.000
Caption: it did not sit well it was far too

07:44:07.359 --> 07:44:12.476
Caption: confusing so we sat at the blackboard

07:44:10.000 --> 07:44:15.039
Caption: the two of us musing i sat with

07:44:12.478 --> 07:44:17.759
Caption: schrodinger dreaming of quantum theory

07:44:15.039 --> 07:44:19.679
Caption: but the math of it all made both of us

07:44:17.759 --> 07:44:21.599
Caption: dreary

07:44:19.679 --> 07:44:23.359
Caption: what was it about

07:44:21.599 --> 07:44:24.957
Caption: we were not content

07:44:23.359 --> 07:44:27.679
Caption: the trouble came down to the

07:44:24.957 --> 07:44:28.476
Caption: entanglement and then a knock at the

07:44:27.679 --> 07:44:32.240
Caption: door

07:44:28.478 --> 07:44:35.759
Caption: a box but who was it for

07:44:32.240 --> 07:44:38.718
Caption: we looked in and saw a cat in a box we

07:44:35.759 --> 07:44:40.160
Caption: looked in and saw a cat that talks

07:44:38.718 --> 07:44:41.919
Caption: and it said to us

07:44:40.160 --> 07:44:44.798
Caption: get me out of this box

07:44:41.919 --> 07:44:46.798
Caption: i was happy to see it an extra mind

07:44:44.798 --> 07:44:49.281
Caption: right now we needed all the help we

07:44:46.798 --> 07:44:51.919
Caption: could find

07:44:49.279 --> 07:44:55.119
Caption: and then an idea with the cat&#39;s great

07:44:51.919 --> 07:44:56.876
Caption: sight it could see a single quantum a

07:44:55.119 --> 07:44:59.679
Caption: quantum of light

07:44:56.878 --> 07:45:01.281
Caption: an excited atom will decay

07:44:59.679 --> 07:45:02.876
Caption: a random condition

07:45:01.279 --> 07:45:05.839
Caption: the cat might see

07:45:02.878 --> 07:45:08.240
Caption: a super position

07:45:05.839 --> 07:45:12.000
Caption: schrodinger went on next we close the

07:45:08.240 --> 07:45:13.519
Caption: lid to look in the box is what i forbid

07:45:12.000 --> 07:45:14.798
Caption: the cat will see

07:45:13.519 --> 07:45:16.476
Caption: and not see

07:45:14.798 --> 07:45:20.478
Caption: an odd condition

07:45:16.478 --> 07:45:22.638
Caption: the cat will be in superposition

07:45:20.478 --> 07:45:25.521
Caption: schrodinger used this cat in the box to

07:45:22.638 --> 07:45:27.521
Caption: dream up the first quantum paradox a

07:45:25.519 --> 07:45:29.919
Caption: paradox is something that doesn&#39;t make

07:45:27.519 --> 07:45:31.759
Caption: sense there must be an assumption that

07:45:29.919 --> 07:45:34.080
Caption: is causing offense

07:45:31.759 --> 07:45:36.796
Caption: the theory has failed schrodinger cried

07:45:34.080 --> 07:45:38.878
Caption: we must start all over and swallow our

07:45:36.798 --> 07:45:41.601
Caption: pride

07:45:38.878 --> 07:45:44.080
Caption: but then i smiled to our own merry meant

07:45:41.599 --> 07:45:46.796
Caption: we have the cat box and adam to do the

07:45:44.080 --> 07:45:49.199
Caption: experiment the scientific method is to

07:45:46.798 --> 07:45:53.521
Caption: test hypotheses so our knowledge can

07:45:49.199 --> 07:45:53.519
Caption: grow beyond just the abcs

07:45:53.599 --> 07:45:57.759
Caption: through all of this shaking its head the

07:45:55.679 --> 07:46:00.160
Caption: cat quietly listened to all that was

07:45:57.759 --> 07:46:02.398
Caption: said a quantum superposition the cat

07:46:00.160 --> 07:46:04.240
Caption: said with the psy a silly idea and i&#39;ll

07:46:02.398 --> 07:46:07.679
Caption: tell you why but i must teach you some

07:46:04.240 --> 07:46:10.718
Caption: physics and where it applies

07:46:07.679 --> 07:46:12.839
Caption: the lesson began i see your intent but

07:46:10.718 --> 07:46:15.121
Caption: the most important thing is the

07:46:12.839 --> 07:46:17.279
Caption: measurement when i look at the atom to

07:46:15.119 --> 07:46:19.039
Caption: see if it&#39;s spent i create in the world

07:46:17.279 --> 07:46:21.439
Caption: a quantum event

07:46:19.039 --> 07:46:24.396
Caption: when measurement acts the atom itself is

07:46:21.439 --> 07:46:27.199
Caption: forced to collapse it might stay excited

07:46:24.398 --> 07:46:29.839
Caption: it might decay but which it will be no

07:46:27.199 --> 07:46:29.839
Caption: one can say

07:46:30.160 --> 07:46:34.160
Caption: but all is not lost we are not throwing

07:46:32.160 --> 07:46:36.080
Caption: dice we can calculate some things when

07:46:34.160 --> 07:46:38.000
Caption: science gives us advice

07:46:36.080 --> 07:46:38.878
Caption: though nothing is certain one thing is

07:46:38.000 --> 07:46:40.839
Caption: key

07:46:38.878 --> 07:46:44.240
Caption: physics can tell us the

07:46:40.839 --> 07:46:47.279
Caption: probability quantum probability a tricky

07:46:44.240 --> 07:46:50.638
Caption: concept to use it one needs to be quite

07:46:47.279 --> 07:46:53.839
Caption: adept but study the math and before long

07:46:50.638 --> 07:46:56.398
Caption: the quantum tune you&#39;ll be singing along

07:46:53.839 --> 07:46:58.478
Caption: algebra calculus and geometry

07:46:56.398 --> 07:47:00.798
Caption: the more math you know the happier

07:46:58.478 --> 07:47:02.398
Caption: you&#39;ll be

07:47:00.798 --> 07:47:04.478
Caption: the cat was not done there was more

07:47:02.398 --> 07:47:06.718
Caption: quantum physics such a rich theory can&#39;t

07:47:04.478 --> 07:47:08.398
Caption: be taught in mere minutes the next

07:47:06.718 --> 07:47:10.478
Caption: lesson i have is where the name comes

07:47:08.398 --> 07:47:12.798
Caption: from i&#39;ll tell you why we call it

07:47:10.478 --> 07:47:15.201
Caption: quantum you see said the cat when you

07:47:12.798 --> 07:47:17.201
Caption: measure my size any number at all is due

07:47:15.199 --> 07:47:19.279
Caption: to arise

07:47:17.199 --> 07:47:22.238
Caption: but measure an atom and what will come

07:47:19.279 --> 07:47:23.279
Caption: out a single quantum of energy will be

07:47:22.240 --> 07:47:26.160
Caption: brought about

07:47:23.279 --> 07:47:29.039
Caption: a photon of light will be let go the

07:47:26.160 --> 07:47:32.558
Caption: atom&#39;s energy from high to low

07:47:29.039 --> 07:47:36.957
Caption: the photons energy must be exact one

07:47:32.558 --> 07:47:38.878
Caption: quantum of light from the atom subtract

07:47:36.957 --> 07:47:40.876
Caption: so you see now said the box cat no

07:47:38.878 --> 07:47:43.201
Caption: superposition no doubt about that when i

07:47:40.878 --> 07:47:47.121
Caption: measure i break the quantum effect no

07:47:43.199 --> 07:47:49.279
Caption: paradox at all that you should suspect

07:47:47.119 --> 07:47:51.439
Caption: i know all of this schrodinger quickly

07:47:49.279 --> 07:47:53.439
Caption: replied i invented this theory a fact

07:47:51.439 --> 07:47:55.359
Caption: none deny i&#39;m afraid it is you who is

07:47:53.439 --> 07:47:57.359
Caption: missing a fact the best part of the

07:47:55.359 --> 07:47:59.919
Caption: theory is due for its act

07:47:57.359 --> 07:48:01.759
Caption: of course i am talking of entanglement

07:47:59.919 --> 07:48:04.080
Caption: the source that is giving me such

07:48:01.759 --> 07:48:06.000
Caption: bafflement

07:48:04.080 --> 07:48:08.240
Caption: the box will be closed just the atom and

07:48:06.000 --> 07:48:11.279
Caption: you a large quantum thing becomes of the

07:48:08.240 --> 07:48:14.080
Caption: two you and the atom entanglement a

07:48:11.279 --> 07:48:17.279
Caption: curious state it&#39;s no accident we&#39;ll

07:48:14.080 --> 07:48:19.279
Caption: open the box and ask just one question

07:48:17.279 --> 07:48:20.556
Caption: what did it look like the quantum

07:48:19.279 --> 07:48:23.359
Caption: connection

07:48:20.558 --> 07:48:27.201
Caption: i wish to resolve this deep mystery so

07:48:23.359 --> 07:48:29.919
Caption: future scientists have less misery

07:48:27.199 --> 07:48:32.318
Caption: the cat disagreed it&#39;s not mysterious

07:48:29.919 --> 07:48:34.398
Caption: you have simply mixed up our experience

07:48:32.320 --> 07:48:36.958
Caption: outside the box lies uncertainty but for

07:48:34.398 --> 07:48:39.361
Caption: me in the box i will know what i see the

07:48:36.957 --> 07:48:41.679
Caption: light from the atom will come or will

07:48:39.359 --> 07:48:42.957
Caption: not and not superposed as you have

07:48:41.679 --> 07:48:45.199
Caption: thought

07:48:42.957 --> 07:48:47.759
Caption: but the cat could see without doubt we

07:48:45.199 --> 07:48:50.238
Caption: were not ready ready to let it get out

07:48:47.759 --> 07:48:53.199
Caption: so the cat agreed to stay in and wait

07:48:50.240 --> 07:48:55.759
Caption: for the atom inside to change its state

07:48:53.199 --> 07:48:59.599
Caption: so the trial began the atom and cat

07:48:55.759 --> 07:49:02.240
Caption: inside the box it quietly sat

07:48:59.599 --> 07:49:04.957
Caption: we waited too the tension was rife we

07:49:02.240 --> 07:49:07.599
Caption: decided to wait for the adam&#39;s half-life

07:49:04.957 --> 07:49:10.078
Caption: that is the time for the atom&#39;s decay to

07:49:07.599 --> 07:49:12.000
Caption: reach the point of half what it may the

07:49:10.080 --> 07:49:14.478
Caption: point of half-life was shown on the

07:49:12.000 --> 07:49:15.519
Caption: clock schrodinger knew what went on in

07:49:14.478 --> 07:49:18.240
Caption: the box

07:49:15.519 --> 07:49:22.080
Caption: two possibilities at the same time but

07:49:18.240 --> 07:49:24.320
Caption: open the box and only one we shall find

07:49:22.080 --> 07:49:26.558
Caption: but what had gone on before the box

07:49:24.320 --> 07:49:29.519
Caption: opened from the cat in the box it will

07:49:26.558 --> 07:49:30.638
Caption: be spoken so we opened the box and what

07:49:29.519 --> 07:49:34.716
Caption: was in there

07:49:30.638 --> 07:49:37.121
Caption: the cat sitting quietly licking its hair

07:49:34.718 --> 07:49:39.361
Caption: cat shouted schrodinger what do you say

07:49:37.119 --> 07:49:41.759
Caption: what did you see do not delay

07:49:39.359 --> 07:49:43.599
Caption: it is as i said i saw the photon nothing

07:49:41.759 --> 07:49:45.759
Caption: strange at all in the box has gone on

07:49:43.599 --> 07:49:49.119
Caption: the atom collapsed a short time ago i

07:49:45.759 --> 07:49:51.359
Caption: measured its light as it will now show

07:49:49.119 --> 07:49:53.759
Caption: for science to work repetition is key to

07:49:51.359 --> 07:49:56.320
Caption: correct errors we need at least three

07:49:53.759 --> 07:49:59.679
Caption: but more is better data is gold so

07:49:56.320 --> 07:50:01.919
Caption: valuable it&#39;s bought and it&#39;s sold

07:49:59.679 --> 07:50:05.919
Caption: so the cat went back in again and again

07:50:01.919 --> 07:50:08.478
Caption: the cat was amused and did not complain

07:50:05.919 --> 07:50:10.718
Caption: the results were in and we had to agree

07:50:08.478 --> 07:50:13.361
Caption: there was no quantum magic for the cat

07:50:10.718 --> 07:50:15.121
Caption: to see the light from the atom came or

07:50:13.359 --> 07:50:16.476
Caption: did not but never them both as

07:50:15.119 --> 07:50:19.119
Caption: schrodinger thought

07:50:16.478 --> 07:50:20.798
Caption: now we are happy with no paradox thanks

07:50:19.119 --> 07:50:23.119
Caption: to the cat

07:50:20.798 --> 07:50:26.281
Caption: the cat in the box

07:50:23.119 --> 07:50:26.279
Caption: the end

07:50:30.330 --> 07:50:33.439
Caption: [Applause]

07:50:31.519 --> 07:50:36.320
Caption: okay so there was lots of words in there

07:50:33.439 --> 07:50:37.679
Caption: um they upset schrodinger

07:50:36.320 --> 07:50:40.478
Caption: i don&#39;t know if you know who erwin

07:50:37.679 --> 07:50:43.279
Caption: schrodinger is he&#39;s a german scientist

07:50:40.478 --> 07:50:46.958
Caption: austrian science i can&#39;t remember

07:50:43.279 --> 07:50:46.957
Caption: back then it didn&#39;t matter um

07:50:48.478 --> 07:50:51.041
Caption: but he

07:50:49.599 --> 07:50:53.279
Caption: this is what he wrote it&#39;s like this

07:50:51.039 --> 07:50:54.957
Caption: obscure paper that he became famous for

07:50:53.279 --> 07:50:55.839
Caption: and this was you know this isn&#39;t exactly

07:50:54.957 --> 07:50:58.556
Caption: what he wrote because he wrote it in

07:50:55.839 --> 07:51:01.199
Caption: german but this is the translation

07:50:58.558 --> 07:51:03.121
Caption: so we can read that so one can even set

07:51:01.199 --> 07:51:05.359
Caption: up quite ridiculous cases a cat is

07:51:03.119 --> 07:51:07.039
Caption: penned up in a steel chamber along with

07:51:05.359 --> 07:51:09.039
Caption: the following device which must be

07:51:07.039 --> 07:51:10.078
Caption: secured against direct interference by

07:51:09.039 --> 07:51:12.476
Caption: the cat

07:51:10.080 --> 07:51:14.718
Caption: in a geiger counter that is the thing

07:51:12.478 --> 07:51:16.798
Caption: that tests radioactivity there&#39;s a

07:51:14.718 --> 07:51:18.638
Caption: little bit of radioactive substance so

07:51:16.798 --> 07:51:20.878
Caption: small that perhaps in the course of an

07:51:18.638 --> 07:51:23.281
Caption: hour one of the atoms decays

07:51:20.878 --> 07:51:24.240
Caption: but also with equal probability perhaps

07:51:23.279 --> 07:51:25.919
Caption: none

07:51:24.240 --> 07:51:28.000
Caption: if it happens the counter tube

07:51:25.919 --> 07:51:30.798
Caption: discharges and through a relay releases

07:51:28.000 --> 07:51:32.718
Caption: a hammer that shatters a small flask of

07:51:30.798 --> 07:51:34.798
Caption: hydrocyanic acid

07:51:32.718 --> 07:51:36.718
Caption: if one has left this entire system to

07:51:34.798 --> 07:51:38.878
Caption: itself for an hour one would say that

07:51:36.718 --> 07:51:40.398
Caption: the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom

07:51:38.878 --> 07:51:42.558
Caption: has decay

07:51:40.398 --> 07:51:43.759
Caption: but the first atomic decay would have

07:51:42.558 --> 07:51:46.000
Caption: poisoned it

07:51:43.759 --> 07:51:48.080
Caption: the psi function which i&#39;ll tell you

07:51:46.000 --> 07:51:50.878
Caption: about in a minute of the entire system

07:51:48.080 --> 07:51:52.878
Caption: would express this by having in the

07:51:50.878 --> 07:51:56.240
Caption: living and dead cat

07:51:52.878 --> 07:51:57.601
Caption: mixed or smeared out in equal parts

07:51:56.240 --> 07:52:00.398
Caption: um

07:51:57.599 --> 07:52:01.199
Caption: this is like early 20th century germany

07:52:00.398 --> 07:52:03.519
Caption: that&#39;s

07:52:01.199 --> 07:52:04.396
Caption: probably not

07:52:03.519 --> 07:52:05.599
Caption: uncommon

07:52:04.398 --> 07:52:07.599
Caption: um

07:52:05.599 --> 07:52:09.519
Caption: so i i changed it for the modern times

07:52:07.599 --> 07:52:10.398
Caption: so we have this cool cat that doesn&#39;t

07:52:09.519 --> 07:52:11.919
Caption: die

07:52:10.398 --> 07:52:13.759
Caption: um

07:52:11.919 --> 07:52:15.039
Caption: but that you know that was one paragraph

07:52:13.759 --> 07:52:17.039
Caption: and and that&#39;s

07:52:15.039 --> 07:52:20.000
Caption: one of the most famous things that

07:52:17.039 --> 07:52:21.919
Caption: schrodinger or the it&#39;s the most

07:52:20.000 --> 07:52:23.599
Caption: yeah it&#39;s what he&#39;s most famous for

07:52:21.919 --> 07:52:24.558
Caption: although

07:52:23.599 --> 07:52:27.359
Caption: he did

07:52:24.558 --> 07:52:28.398
Caption: invent the schrodinger equation which is

07:52:27.359 --> 07:52:29.279
Caption: still

07:52:28.398 --> 07:52:31.201
Caption: the

07:52:29.279 --> 07:52:33.919
Caption: equation that we use in quantum physics

07:52:31.199 --> 07:52:36.957
Caption: to explain the behavior of the

07:52:33.919 --> 07:52:36.957
Caption: microscopic world

07:52:37.519 --> 07:52:40.796
Caption: and i&#39;m going to tell you a little bit

07:52:39.039 --> 07:52:41.759
Caption: about that because

07:52:40.798 --> 07:52:43.041
Caption: today

07:52:41.759 --> 07:52:45.119
Caption: you know at this at the center for

07:52:43.039 --> 07:52:47.039
Caption: quantum software and places all around

07:52:45.119 --> 07:52:49.439
Caption: the world we&#39;re trying to build a new

07:52:47.039 --> 07:52:51.919
Caption: kind of computing technology that&#39;s

07:52:49.439 --> 07:52:54.320
Caption: built from these things that that

07:52:51.919 --> 07:52:55.839
Caption: schrodinger&#39;s talking about

07:52:54.320 --> 07:52:57.839
Caption: and he was really frustrated about

07:52:55.839 --> 07:53:01.359
Caption: quantum theory in fact he left quantum

07:52:57.839 --> 07:53:02.876
Caption: theory to become an irish botanist

07:53:01.359 --> 07:53:04.957
Caption: which is also true

07:53:02.878 --> 07:53:07.121
Caption: and he wrote a book called what is life

07:53:04.957 --> 07:53:09.279
Caption: and that became very influential to

07:53:07.119 --> 07:53:10.876
Caption: people like francis crick who went on to

07:53:09.279 --> 07:53:15.716
Caption: discover

07:53:10.878 --> 07:53:15.718
Caption: dna after he stole photos from someone

07:53:15.839 --> 07:53:18.957
Caption: so

07:53:16.798 --> 07:53:21.919
Caption: you know he&#39;s

07:53:18.957 --> 07:53:23.759
Caption: an odd an odd character and i think had

07:53:21.919 --> 07:53:25.839
Caption: he stayed in quantum physics

07:53:23.759 --> 07:53:26.876
Caption: he probably would have figured out

07:53:25.839 --> 07:53:28.478
Caption: some of the things that i&#39;m going to

07:53:26.878 --> 07:53:30.638
Caption: tell you

07:53:28.478 --> 07:53:31.679
Caption: in a little bit

07:53:30.638 --> 07:53:33.201
Caption: okay so

07:53:31.679 --> 07:53:34.558
Caption: what&#39;s all this stuff about atoms so

07:53:33.199 --> 07:53:36.556
Caption: you&#39;ve probably seen a picture like that

07:53:34.558 --> 07:53:37.601
Caption: maybe you remember it from your high

07:53:36.558 --> 07:53:40.240
Caption: school

07:53:37.599 --> 07:53:42.957
Caption: chemistry or science class

07:53:40.240 --> 07:53:45.041
Caption: you have this thing in the middle and

07:53:42.957 --> 07:53:46.000
Caption: and then the electrons go around the

07:53:45.039 --> 07:53:48.000
Caption: outside

07:53:46.000 --> 07:53:50.478
Caption: and the further away they&#39;re away from

07:53:48.000 --> 07:53:53.839
Caption: the center the more energy they have

07:53:50.478 --> 07:53:55.759
Caption: so the lowest energy state is called the

07:53:53.839 --> 07:53:58.796
Caption: ground state and the highest energy

07:53:55.759 --> 07:54:01.199
Caption: state is called the excited state

07:53:58.798 --> 07:54:03.441
Caption: so there&#39;s two imagine two states

07:54:01.199 --> 07:54:04.876
Caption: ground state excited state

07:54:03.439 --> 07:54:06.716
Caption: if

07:54:04.878 --> 07:54:09.201
Caption: the electron goes from the excited state

07:54:06.718 --> 07:54:10.798
Caption: to the ground state we call that decay

07:54:09.199 --> 07:54:12.636
Caption: and when that happens

07:54:10.798 --> 07:54:14.638
Caption: energy has to be given off there&#39;s

07:54:12.638 --> 07:54:16.638
Caption: conservation of energy if you have high

07:54:14.638 --> 07:54:18.080
Caption: energy then low energy then that energy

07:54:16.638 --> 07:54:20.000
Caption: has to go somewhere

07:54:18.080 --> 07:54:22.478
Caption: and that energy is always the same

07:54:20.000 --> 07:54:24.398
Caption: amount and that&#39;s where the word quantum

07:54:22.478 --> 07:54:27.121
Caption: in quantum physics comes from

07:54:24.398 --> 07:54:28.718
Caption: and we usually associate things in

07:54:27.119 --> 07:54:32.876
Caption: quantum physics at the fundamental level

07:54:28.718 --> 07:54:33.761
Caption: with particles and so it&#39;s a photon

07:54:32.878 --> 07:54:36.398
Caption: so

07:54:33.759 --> 07:54:38.796
Caption: energy from the electron gets turned

07:54:36.398 --> 07:54:41.599
Caption: into electromagnetic energy that we can

07:54:38.798 --> 07:54:41.601
Caption: detect and see

07:54:43.199 --> 07:54:47.919
Caption: we&#39;ll move closer to abstraction we&#39;ll

07:54:45.279 --> 07:54:49.599
Caption: get rid of this picture that we draw

07:54:47.919 --> 07:54:51.359
Caption: for

07:54:49.599 --> 07:54:52.398
Caption: for students

07:54:51.359 --> 07:54:54.320
Caption: and

07:54:52.398 --> 07:54:56.080
Caption: in science we we think of like a ladder

07:54:54.320 --> 07:54:58.638
Caption: of energy and you can step up and step

07:54:56.080 --> 07:54:59.439
Caption: down and you need to

07:54:58.638 --> 07:55:01.759
Caption: to

07:54:59.439 --> 07:55:04.160
Caption: step to drop down you have to give away

07:55:01.759 --> 07:55:06.558
Caption: energy that&#39;s the decay but you can also

07:55:04.160 --> 07:55:08.558
Caption: have the opposite which is absorption

07:55:06.558 --> 07:55:09.679
Caption: and so for something to gain energy to

07:55:08.558 --> 07:55:12.798
Caption: step up

07:55:09.679 --> 07:55:15.199
Caption: then it has to accept a photon and that

07:55:12.798 --> 07:55:17.681
Caption: amount of energy has to be

07:55:15.199 --> 07:55:17.679
Caption: exact

07:55:18.160 --> 07:55:22.000
Caption: okay so the picture in the book was like

07:55:19.919 --> 07:55:23.679
Caption: this you know artistic between ground

07:55:22.000 --> 07:55:24.638
Caption: state and excited state

07:55:23.679 --> 07:55:25.759
Caption: um

07:55:24.638 --> 07:55:27.121
Caption: you know in

07:55:25.759 --> 07:55:30.000
Caption: in

07:55:27.119 --> 07:55:31.279
Caption: in physics we draw this energy level

07:55:30.000 --> 07:55:33.519
Caption: diagram

07:55:31.279 --> 07:55:33.519
Caption: and

07:55:33.679 --> 07:55:38.636
Caption: since we&#39;re all comfortable with um

07:55:36.000 --> 07:55:39.679
Caption: binary numbers here let&#39;s label them one

07:55:38.638 --> 07:55:42.000
Caption: and zero

07:55:39.679 --> 07:55:44.160
Caption: so you can see now that this atom can

07:55:42.000 --> 07:55:45.919
Caption: encode a bit of information

07:55:44.160 --> 07:55:46.718
Caption: in its energy levels

07:55:45.919 --> 07:55:48.876
Caption: and

07:55:46.718 --> 07:55:50.878
Caption: it can do more than that

07:55:48.878 --> 07:55:53.041
Caption: and how the the secret to quantum

07:55:50.878 --> 07:55:55.121
Caption: physics is to do this

07:55:53.039 --> 07:55:56.556
Caption: you put little symbols around it

07:55:55.119 --> 07:55:59.599
Caption: and now becomes

07:55:56.558 --> 07:56:01.679
Caption: what schrodinger called a psi function

07:55:59.599 --> 07:56:03.919
Caption: and i&#39;ll i&#39;ll tell you why we do that in

07:56:01.679 --> 07:56:06.080
Caption: a second

07:56:03.919 --> 07:56:08.876
Caption: okay so in the book

07:56:06.080 --> 07:56:10.398
Caption: if the atom is excited then it hasn&#39;t

07:56:08.878 --> 07:56:12.240
Caption: give it hasn&#39;t decayed and it hasn&#39;t

07:56:10.398 --> 07:56:14.320
Caption: given off this photon so the cat can&#39;t

07:56:12.240 --> 07:56:16.958
Caption: see anything

07:56:14.320 --> 07:56:19.919
Caption: uh if it decayed then the cat

07:56:16.957 --> 07:56:20.957
Caption: sees the photon that was given off and

07:56:19.919 --> 07:56:25.439
Caption: the

07:56:20.957 --> 07:56:28.716
Caption: uh the electron is in the lower state

07:56:25.439 --> 07:56:28.716
Caption: but what about in the middle

07:56:28.839 --> 07:56:33.919
Caption: hmm that&#39;s interesting can we do that

07:56:31.599 --> 07:56:35.759
Caption: sure why not it&#39;s quantum physics and we

07:56:33.919 --> 07:56:38.080
Caption: say that

07:56:35.759 --> 07:56:40.957
Caption: it&#39;s in a superposition

07:56:38.080 --> 07:56:43.958
Caption: so it&#39;s in both zero and one at the same

07:56:40.957 --> 07:56:43.957
Caption: time

07:56:44.240 --> 07:56:48.478
Caption: and

07:56:46.160 --> 07:56:50.000
Caption: that&#39;s the sort of secret to quantum

07:56:48.478 --> 07:56:50.878
Caption: physics so

07:56:50.000 --> 07:56:52.957
Caption: it&#39;s

07:56:50.878 --> 07:56:54.638
Caption: even though i&#39;ve labeled it zero and one

07:56:52.957 --> 07:56:57.439
Caption: it it doesn&#39;t encode a bit of

07:56:54.638 --> 07:56:59.521
Caption: information anymore

07:56:57.439 --> 07:57:02.240
Caption: technically it&#39;s a new mathematical

07:56:59.519 --> 07:57:03.759
Caption: object it&#39;s a vector and if you know

07:57:02.240 --> 07:57:05.041
Caption: anything about vectors then you can add

07:57:03.759 --> 07:57:06.398
Caption: them together

07:57:05.039 --> 07:57:09.519
Caption: so

07:57:06.398 --> 07:57:12.320
Caption: in addition to 0 and 1 i can have any

07:57:09.519 --> 07:57:13.279
Caption: sort of combination of zero and one

07:57:12.320 --> 07:57:14.160
Caption: as well

07:57:13.279 --> 07:57:15.039
Caption: so

07:57:14.160 --> 07:57:17.679
Caption: this

07:57:15.039 --> 07:57:20.000
Caption: is a new kind of information

07:57:17.679 --> 07:57:24.080
Caption: that is much richer than our

07:57:20.000 --> 07:57:26.878
Caption: conventional notion of bits

07:57:24.080 --> 07:57:28.958
Caption: the rule is that

07:57:26.878 --> 07:57:30.958
Caption: either when you try to

07:57:28.957 --> 07:57:32.716
Caption: when you try to go and look at this

07:57:30.957 --> 07:57:34.396
Caption: information you&#39;ll see

07:57:32.718 --> 07:57:35.281
Caption: the lower state

07:57:34.398 --> 07:57:37.759
Caption: or

07:57:35.279 --> 07:57:40.318
Caption: the higher state and

07:57:37.759 --> 07:57:42.876
Caption: what happens is determined by the rules

07:57:40.320 --> 07:57:44.160
Caption: of probability in quantum mechanics

07:57:42.878 --> 07:57:47.761
Caption: okay

07:57:44.160 --> 07:57:50.638
Caption: but you never get to see superpositions

07:57:47.759 --> 07:57:52.638
Caption: so that&#39;s the sort of trick

07:57:50.638 --> 07:57:55.121
Caption: so

07:57:52.638 --> 07:57:57.281
Caption: quantum information is richer in some

07:57:55.119 --> 07:57:58.796
Caption: sense but it&#39;s limiting in another sense

07:57:57.279 --> 07:57:59.679
Caption: and trying to find the balance between

07:57:58.798 --> 07:58:02.160
Caption: those

07:57:59.679 --> 07:58:03.039
Caption: uh is is part of the the trick of the

07:58:02.160 --> 07:58:05.519
Caption: quantum

07:58:03.039 --> 07:58:07.039
Caption: programmer

07:58:05.519 --> 07:58:09.439
Caption: so

07:58:07.039 --> 07:58:11.439
Caption: the the other thing

07:58:09.439 --> 07:58:12.476
Caption: that was mentioned in the book

07:58:11.439 --> 07:58:14.160
Caption: was

07:58:12.478 --> 07:58:15.281
Caption: these correlations

07:58:14.160 --> 07:58:16.638
Caption: so

07:58:15.279 --> 07:58:19.839
Caption: i have

07:58:16.638 --> 07:58:21.601
Caption: the atom being in its lower state and

07:58:19.839 --> 07:58:23.279
Caption: the cat seeing

07:58:21.599 --> 07:58:25.199
Caption: and i have the atom staying in this

07:58:23.279 --> 07:58:27.199
Caption: excited state and the cat not seeing so

07:58:25.199 --> 07:58:29.119
Caption: those two events are correlated

07:58:27.199 --> 07:58:31.119
Caption: and those correlated events can be put

07:58:29.119 --> 07:58:32.238
Caption: in superposition as well why not with

07:58:31.119 --> 07:58:33.919
Caption: their vectors let&#39;s just add them

07:58:32.240 --> 07:58:36.398
Caption: together and that&#39;s what&#39;s called

07:58:33.919 --> 07:58:40.160
Caption: quantum entanglement it&#39;s a coral it&#39;s a

07:58:36.398 --> 07:58:41.041
Caption: superposition of these correlations

07:58:40.160 --> 07:58:42.478
Caption: uh

07:58:41.039 --> 07:58:43.919
Caption: so schrodinger he was sitting outside

07:58:42.478 --> 07:58:45.919
Caption: the box and that&#39;s what he&#39;s had in his

07:58:43.919 --> 07:58:48.160
Caption: mind okay according to quantum mechanics

07:58:45.919 --> 07:58:50.558
Caption: these things are correlated and i have

07:58:48.160 --> 07:58:52.878
Caption: to describe them in this way

07:58:50.558 --> 07:58:54.398
Caption: but i only ever see this

07:58:52.878 --> 07:58:56.320
Caption: or this

07:58:54.398 --> 07:58:58.240
Caption: so what does that other thing mean

07:58:56.320 --> 07:59:00.240
Caption: right what what are these what are these

07:58:58.240 --> 07:59:03.599
Caption: things inside this

07:59:00.240 --> 07:59:05.759
Caption: angle bracket and straight back

07:59:03.599 --> 07:59:08.080
Caption: back at me

07:59:05.759 --> 07:59:08.080
Caption: um

07:59:08.240 --> 07:59:12.320
Caption: basically his his question was what is

07:59:10.398 --> 07:59:13.041
Caption: this psi function

07:59:12.320 --> 07:59:14.160
Caption: so

07:59:13.039 --> 07:59:16.238
Caption: yeah when we

07:59:14.160 --> 07:59:18.638
Caption: when we write out arbitrary

07:59:16.240 --> 07:59:20.320
Caption: states of quantum information we usually

07:59:18.638 --> 07:59:21.041
Caption: use greek letters

07:59:20.320 --> 07:59:22.240
Caption: and

07:59:21.039 --> 07:59:23.759
Caption: we start with psi and then we run

07:59:22.240 --> 07:59:25.041
Caption: through them all until

07:59:23.759 --> 07:59:26.638
Caption: we run out and then we start putting

07:59:25.039 --> 07:59:27.839
Caption: subscripts and superscripts and all

07:59:26.638 --> 07:59:31.121
Caption: sorts of

07:59:27.839 --> 07:59:32.957
Caption: stuff that scares people away

07:59:31.119 --> 07:59:33.839
Caption: probably on purpose

07:59:32.957 --> 07:59:35.759
Caption: okay

07:59:33.839 --> 07:59:37.359
Caption: so the answer to the question there&#39;s

07:59:35.759 --> 07:59:38.558
Caption: two answers to the question

07:59:37.359 --> 07:59:39.359
Caption: one is

07:59:38.558 --> 07:59:41.041
Caption: this

07:59:39.359 --> 07:59:42.000
Caption: object

07:59:41.039 --> 07:59:44.158
Caption: is

07:59:42.000 --> 07:59:46.638
Caption: in one-to-one correspondence with what&#39;s

07:59:44.160 --> 07:59:47.759
Caption: really happening it&#39;s what describes

07:59:46.638 --> 07:59:49.441
Caption: reality

07:59:47.759 --> 07:59:51.519
Caption: that&#39;s one way to look at it

07:59:49.439 --> 07:59:53.519
Caption: if you follow that path it&#39;ll lead you

07:59:51.519 --> 07:59:55.519
Caption: towards like

07:59:53.519 --> 07:59:58.160
Caption: parallel universes many worlds the

07:59:55.519 --> 07:59:58.160
Caption: multiverse

07:59:58.320 --> 08:00:01.919
Caption: marvel movies that sort of thing

08:00:00.878 --> 08:00:03.201
Caption: um

08:00:01.919 --> 08:00:06.876
Caption: a lot of

08:00:03.199 --> 08:00:07.679
Caption: philosophers and physicists like this um

08:00:06.878 --> 08:00:10.638
Caption: but

08:00:07.679 --> 08:00:13.119
Caption: in the 90s well maybe like in the 80s

08:00:10.638 --> 08:00:15.521
Caption: people started to think about this

08:00:13.119 --> 08:00:16.796
Caption: what if this object is really just

08:00:15.519 --> 08:00:19.519
Caption: information

08:00:16.798 --> 08:00:20.478
Caption: and if we think about it in that way

08:00:19.519 --> 08:00:23.759
Caption: then

08:00:20.478 --> 08:00:26.160
Caption: we have this we&#39;re not constrained by

08:00:23.759 --> 08:00:29.919
Caption: uh our physical intuition

08:00:26.160 --> 08:00:32.478
Caption: that we require when we practice physics

08:00:29.919 --> 08:00:34.320
Caption: and so in the in the 80s

08:00:32.478 --> 08:00:35.919
Caption: people started to think about

08:00:34.320 --> 08:00:37.919
Caption: what we could do

08:00:35.919 --> 08:00:40.876
Caption: with this information

08:00:37.919 --> 08:00:42.638
Caption: it seems to be richer than

08:00:40.878 --> 08:00:44.000
Caption: bits

08:00:42.638 --> 08:00:45.521
Caption: um

08:00:44.000 --> 08:00:47.679
Caption: could we

08:00:45.519 --> 08:00:50.476
Caption: could we just simulate it

08:00:47.679 --> 08:00:54.240
Caption: so i saw a talk just just earlier today

08:00:50.478 --> 08:00:57.599
Caption: where someone mentioned a turing machine

08:00:54.240 --> 08:01:00.240
Caption: so there&#39;s the famous uh church touring

08:00:57.599 --> 08:01:01.279
Caption: thesis that basically the physical

08:01:00.240 --> 08:01:03.599
Caption: version is

08:01:01.279 --> 08:01:05.919
Caption: a touring computer can efficiently

08:01:03.599 --> 08:01:07.199
Caption: simulate any physical process in the

08:01:05.919 --> 08:01:08.798
Caption: universe

08:01:07.199 --> 08:01:10.396
Caption: but that doesn&#39;t seem to be true of

08:01:08.798 --> 08:01:11.121
Caption: quantum physics

08:01:10.398 --> 08:01:12.240
Caption: so

08:01:11.119 --> 08:01:14.318
Caption: in the 80s

08:01:12.240 --> 08:01:16.638
Caption: they invented the

08:01:14.320 --> 08:01:17.839
Caption: notion of a quantum turing machine and

08:01:16.638 --> 08:01:19.839
Caption: there&#39;s a new

08:01:17.839 --> 08:01:21.359
Caption: thesis the quantum church turning thesis

08:01:19.839 --> 08:01:23.599
Caption: by the way

08:01:21.359 --> 08:01:25.199
Caption: if you&#39;re ever

08:01:23.599 --> 08:01:26.716
Caption: get into quantum physics it&#39;s just an

08:01:25.199 --> 08:01:28.556
Caption: exercise in putting the word quantum in

08:01:26.718 --> 08:01:29.919
Caption: front of everything that everyone else

08:01:28.558 --> 08:01:32.160
Caption: has already worked out

08:01:29.919 --> 08:01:32.160
Caption: um

08:01:32.878 --> 08:01:36.398
Caption: the quantum church touring thesis says

08:01:34.638 --> 08:01:38.638
Caption: that a universal quantum computer could

08:01:36.398 --> 08:01:40.558
Caption: efficiently simulate every any physical

08:01:38.638 --> 08:01:42.080
Caption: process in the universe and we don&#39;t

08:01:40.558 --> 08:01:45.281
Caption: know we don&#39;t have an answer to that

08:01:42.080 --> 08:01:47.599
Caption: question of if there&#39;s a gap is a

08:01:45.279 --> 08:01:51.039
Caption: quantum computer actually more powerful

08:01:47.599 --> 08:01:52.636
Caption: than a classical computer

08:01:51.039 --> 08:01:54.238
Caption: you&#39;ll win a million dollars if you can

08:01:52.638 --> 08:01:57.361
Caption: answer that question it&#39;s related to the

08:01:54.240 --> 08:01:59.439
Caption: famous p versus mp complete question

08:01:57.359 --> 08:02:01.279
Caption: um but you probably win a lot more stuff

08:01:59.439 --> 08:02:03.039
Caption: if you figure that out so we don&#39;t know

08:02:01.279 --> 08:02:04.796
Caption: but we highly suspect

08:02:03.039 --> 08:02:05.759
Caption: that a quantum computer

08:02:04.798 --> 08:02:07.361
Caption: is

08:02:05.759 --> 08:02:08.876
Caption: in some sense more powerful than a

08:02:07.359 --> 08:02:10.160
Caption: classical computer

08:02:08.878 --> 08:02:13.121
Caption: and

08:02:10.160 --> 08:02:14.558
Caption: in 1995 a guy named peter shore

08:02:13.119 --> 08:02:16.238
Caption: figured out that if you could build a

08:02:14.558 --> 08:02:17.521
Caption: quantum computer there&#39;s an algorithm

08:02:16.240 --> 08:02:19.679
Caption: you can run on it

08:02:17.519 --> 08:02:20.716
Caption: called shore&#39;s algorithm now

08:02:19.679 --> 08:02:22.080
Caption: i don&#39;t think he called it shaw&#39;s

08:02:20.718 --> 08:02:23.201
Caption: algorithm but

08:02:22.080 --> 08:02:25.041
Caption: people after him called it shorts

08:02:23.199 --> 08:02:27.199
Caption: alcohol

08:02:25.039 --> 08:02:28.318
Caption: that would crack our essay

08:02:27.199 --> 08:02:31.039
Caption: and so

08:02:28.320 --> 08:02:32.558
Caption: 1995 was really the cusp when people

08:02:31.039 --> 08:02:34.716
Caption: started to get interested in this

08:02:32.558 --> 08:02:36.320
Caption: because there was money and people tend

08:02:34.718 --> 08:02:37.281
Caption: to follow money

08:02:36.320 --> 08:02:39.759
Caption: and

08:02:37.279 --> 08:02:41.439
Caption: we didn&#39;t have any any device

08:02:39.759 --> 08:02:42.398
Caption: at the time

08:02:41.439 --> 08:02:43.599
Caption: now

08:02:42.398 --> 08:02:45.201
Caption: we have

08:02:43.599 --> 08:02:47.359
Caption: many commercial

08:02:45.199 --> 08:02:49.599
Caption: available quantum computers

08:02:47.359 --> 08:02:50.796
Caption: so at the university of perth i think

08:02:49.599 --> 08:02:53.679
Caption: the only

08:02:50.798 --> 08:02:55.121
Caption: commercially available quantum computer

08:02:53.679 --> 08:02:58.080
Caption: in australia

08:02:55.119 --> 08:03:00.876
Caption: it runs on two quantum bits called

08:02:58.080 --> 08:03:03.839
Caption: qubits so not very impressive and the

08:03:00.878 --> 08:03:05.841
Caption: largest device

08:03:03.839 --> 08:03:07.199
Caption: is around 150

08:03:05.839 --> 08:03:09.119
Caption: quantum bits

08:03:07.199 --> 08:03:10.716
Caption: also called qubits

08:03:09.119 --> 08:03:12.556
Caption: and you can access that for free over

08:03:10.718 --> 08:03:14.080
Caption: the cloud

08:03:12.558 --> 08:03:15.041
Caption: or you can pay

08:03:14.080 --> 08:03:17.119
Caption: and

08:03:15.039 --> 08:03:20.396
Caption: those devices have been sold to

08:03:17.119 --> 08:03:21.919
Caption: governments around the world as well so

08:03:20.398 --> 08:03:23.121
Caption: the

08:03:21.919 --> 08:03:25.359
Caption: the

08:03:23.119 --> 08:03:27.679
Caption: we&#39;ve seen slow progress

08:03:25.359 --> 08:03:28.876
Caption: but in some sense that&#39;s the kind of

08:03:27.679 --> 08:03:30.240
Caption: progress you want to see for new

08:03:28.878 --> 08:03:32.240
Caption: technology you don&#39;t want to see stuff

08:03:30.240 --> 08:03:35.279
Caption: like web 3 or blockchain or whatever

08:03:32.240 --> 08:03:37.041
Caption: where it&#39;s just type and then disappears

08:03:35.279 --> 08:03:38.636
Caption: this is really new transformative

08:03:37.039 --> 08:03:40.876
Caption: technology

08:03:38.638 --> 08:03:42.878
Caption: that requires

08:03:40.878 --> 08:03:44.958
Caption: a slow pace because

08:03:42.878 --> 08:03:48.398
Caption: it&#39;s very difficult

08:03:44.957 --> 08:03:52.318
Caption: so it&#39;s going to require a lot of effort

08:03:48.398 --> 08:03:54.958
Caption: and now is really the time when i think

08:03:52.320 --> 08:03:58.080
Caption: people like you in the audience

08:03:54.957 --> 08:04:00.158
Caption: might consider getting involved because

08:03:58.080 --> 08:04:02.160
Caption: there are devices available

08:04:00.160 --> 08:04:04.798
Caption: and they&#39;re currently being programmed

08:04:02.160 --> 08:04:07.199
Caption: by physicists and if you&#39;ve ever seen

08:04:04.798 --> 08:04:08.558
Caption: physicist code

08:04:07.199 --> 08:04:11.199
Caption: you can see that this is going to lead

08:04:08.558 --> 08:04:13.041
Caption: to a huge disaster

08:04:11.199 --> 08:04:15.199
Caption: um

08:04:13.039 --> 08:04:17.919
Caption: there&#39;s there&#39;s a thriving open source

08:04:15.199 --> 08:04:20.716
Caption: uh community in quantum development um a

08:04:17.919 --> 08:04:23.119
Caption: few my colleagues live stream on twitch

08:04:20.718 --> 08:04:24.718
Caption: quantum development um

08:04:23.119 --> 08:04:26.238
Caption: so it&#39;s definitely something that&#39;s

08:04:24.718 --> 08:04:28.080
Caption: that&#39;s happening now and you can get in

08:04:26.240 --> 08:04:31.599
Caption: early

08:04:28.080 --> 08:04:33.599
Caption: and into this new nation exciting field

08:04:31.599 --> 08:04:36.080
Caption: so that&#39;s all i wanted to tell you today

08:04:33.599 --> 08:04:37.439
Caption: and i&#39;m happy to take any any questions

08:04:36.080 --> 08:04:41.839
Caption: uh about

08:04:37.439 --> 08:04:41.839
Caption: quantum technology or children&#39;s books

08:04:42.000 --> 08:04:44.320
Caption: thank you

08:04:51.519 --> 08:04:55.839
Caption: i think there&#39;s some microphones yeah

08:04:59.119 --> 08:05:04.476
Caption: there&#39;s one up way up there

08:05:01.519 --> 08:05:04.476
Caption: the furthest away

08:05:05.839 --> 08:05:09.478
Caption: go over there next

08:05:12.240 --> 08:05:15.041
Caption: hi thank you very much that was a great

08:05:13.919 --> 08:05:17.199
Caption: talk um

08:05:15.039 --> 08:05:18.957
Caption: if you do you have any recommendations

08:05:17.199 --> 08:05:20.476
Caption: on where to get started with quantum

08:05:18.957 --> 08:05:22.078
Caption: development how to get involved in the

08:05:20.478 --> 08:05:23.919
Caption: community anything like that because it

08:05:22.080 --> 08:05:26.798
Caption: does sound interesting

08:05:23.919 --> 08:05:28.798
Caption: yeah so i i i would suggest starting

08:05:26.798 --> 08:05:29.841
Caption: with um

08:05:28.798 --> 08:05:32.478
Caption: there&#39;s

08:05:29.839 --> 08:05:34.240
Caption: there&#39;s this non-for-profit called the

08:05:32.478 --> 08:05:35.361
Caption: unitary fund

08:05:34.240 --> 08:05:37.359
Caption: and

08:05:35.359 --> 08:05:39.919
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s probably the largest open

08:05:37.359 --> 08:05:41.759
Caption: source quantum community so if you look

08:05:39.919 --> 08:05:42.798
Caption: up unitary fund

08:05:41.759 --> 08:05:44.558
Caption: um

08:05:42.798 --> 08:05:47.601
Caption: and they they&#39;ll give small grants and

08:05:44.558 --> 08:05:49.759
Caption: stuff to people who are interested in in

08:05:47.599 --> 08:05:51.359
Caption: you know

08:05:49.759 --> 08:05:54.160
Caption: uh you know

08:05:51.359 --> 08:05:55.919
Caption: adding small components to existing open

08:05:54.160 --> 08:05:57.519
Caption: source projects

08:05:55.919 --> 08:05:58.876
Caption: yeah and and

08:05:57.519 --> 08:06:00.876
Caption: i would say

08:05:58.878 --> 08:06:03.281
Caption: the majority of people

08:06:00.878 --> 08:06:04.398
Caption: don&#39;t have a background like they&#39;re not

08:06:03.279 --> 08:06:06.000
Caption: phd

08:06:04.398 --> 08:06:08.080
Caption: quantum physicists in that community

08:06:06.000 --> 08:06:08.798
Caption: like they&#39;re people coming from outside

08:06:08.080 --> 08:06:11.359
Caption: of

08:06:08.798 --> 08:06:12.958
Caption: of the of the more traditional quantum

08:06:11.359 --> 08:06:15.279
Caption: computing community

08:06:12.957 --> 08:06:19.078
Caption: so it&#39;s it&#39;s a very welcoming

08:06:15.279 --> 08:06:19.080
Caption: a very welcoming community

08:06:20.398 --> 08:06:23.201
Caption: any other questions

08:06:26.798 --> 08:06:30.601
Caption: i think there&#39;s one down here

08:06:36.080 --> 08:06:41.919
Caption: how many qubits are we looking at before

08:06:38.878 --> 08:06:44.160
Caption: rsa becomes completely useless

08:06:41.919 --> 08:06:44.160
Caption: um

08:06:45.519 --> 08:06:49.599
Caption: millions

08:06:47.439 --> 08:06:51.759
Caption: okay yeah it depends on

08:06:49.599 --> 08:06:51.759
Caption: so

08:06:52.080 --> 08:06:55.439
Caption: the problem today

08:06:53.839 --> 08:06:58.839
Caption: is that

08:06:55.439 --> 08:07:01.039
Caption: qubits are very fragile so a

08:06:58.839 --> 08:07:04.240
Caption: bit um

08:07:01.039 --> 08:07:06.476
Caption: you know a transistor

08:07:04.240 --> 08:07:07.599
Caption: has an error like one in a billion

08:07:06.478 --> 08:07:09.201
Caption: right

08:07:07.599 --> 08:07:11.199
Caption: so but if now that you have a billion in

08:07:09.199 --> 08:07:13.279
Caption: your device they happen quite often so

08:07:11.199 --> 08:07:15.279
Caption: active error correction is is important

08:07:13.279 --> 08:07:17.759
Caption: but it&#39;s far more important for for

08:07:15.279 --> 08:07:17.759
Caption: qubits

08:07:18.000 --> 08:07:23.279
Caption: we&#39;re not at the stage where we we have

08:07:21.039 --> 08:07:25.919
Caption: error corrected qubits we don&#39;t have

08:07:23.279 --> 08:07:27.439
Caption: perfectly operating devices

08:07:25.919 --> 08:07:29.039
Caption: the better we make

08:07:27.439 --> 08:07:31.439
Caption: the physical qubits

08:07:29.039 --> 08:07:33.599
Caption: the fewer we need like the less overhead

08:07:31.439 --> 08:07:36.320
Caption: we need the less redundancy we need

08:07:33.599 --> 08:07:38.796
Caption: so the estimates now are a million but

08:07:36.320 --> 08:07:40.080
Caption: it it could be could be less

08:07:38.798 --> 08:07:41.281
Caption: and so it&#39;s like that&#39;s the worst case

08:07:40.080 --> 08:07:43.119
Caption: scenario

08:07:41.279 --> 08:07:45.439
Caption: and if you look at the trend it looks to

08:07:43.119 --> 08:07:47.039
Caption: be like a moore&#39;s law of qubits

08:07:45.439 --> 08:07:47.919
Caption: that&#39;s maybe

08:07:47.039 --> 08:07:49.439
Caption: 30

08:07:47.919 --> 08:07:51.679
Caption: to 50 years

08:07:49.439 --> 08:07:52.636
Caption: from now

08:07:51.679 --> 08:07:54.398
Caption: so

08:07:52.638 --> 08:07:56.478
Caption: the us government for example has moved

08:07:54.398 --> 08:07:58.478
Caption: to post quantum cryptography already

08:07:56.478 --> 08:08:00.080
Caption: because they have 30-year secrets

08:07:58.478 --> 08:08:01.679
Caption: probably

08:08:00.080 --> 08:08:03.439
Caption: so if you have a secret you need to keep

08:08:01.679 --> 08:08:05.519
Caption: for 30 years then

08:08:03.439 --> 08:08:09.320
Caption: maybe it&#39;s maybe it&#39;s time to to think

08:08:05.519 --> 08:08:09.320
Caption: about post-quantum cryptography

08:08:11.119 --> 08:08:14.238
Caption: i have 30 year old secrets

08:08:18.240 --> 08:08:21.839
Caption: is there a question up here

08:08:19.919 --> 08:08:25.279
Caption: oh over here sorry

08:08:21.839 --> 08:08:27.359
Caption: in your opinion did google truly achieve

08:08:25.279 --> 08:08:28.476
Caption: quantum supremacy

08:08:27.359 --> 08:08:32.160
Caption: uh

08:08:28.478 --> 08:08:32.160
Caption: yeah so there&#39;s this idea that

08:08:32.638 --> 08:08:35.681
Caption: there&#39;s nothing a quantum computer can

08:08:34.398 --> 08:08:36.558
Caption: do today

08:08:35.679 --> 08:08:39.759
Caption: that

08:08:36.558 --> 08:08:40.798
Caption: my mobile phone can&#39;t do

08:08:39.759 --> 08:08:41.759
Caption: as

08:08:40.798 --> 08:08:43.281
Caption: but

08:08:41.759 --> 08:08:45.199
Caption: as quantum computers get bigger every

08:08:43.279 --> 08:08:46.476
Caption: time you add a qubit

08:08:45.199 --> 08:08:48.238
Caption: uh the

08:08:46.478 --> 08:08:50.798
Caption: complexity

08:08:48.240 --> 08:08:53.599
Caption: doubles so it grows exponentially so at

08:08:50.798 --> 08:08:54.638
Caption: some point quantum technology will

08:08:53.599 --> 08:08:57.519
Caption: overtake

08:08:54.638 --> 08:09:00.398
Caption: conventional digital technology

08:08:57.519 --> 08:09:02.957
Caption: and google claimed to had had done that

08:09:00.398 --> 08:09:04.160
Caption: probably three or four years ago at this

08:09:02.957 --> 08:09:06.238
Caption: point

08:09:04.160 --> 08:09:07.279
Caption: but it&#39;s it&#39;s not something that&#39;s easy

08:09:06.240 --> 08:09:08.558
Caption: to prove

08:09:07.279 --> 08:09:10.000
Caption: right

08:09:08.558 --> 08:09:11.521
Caption: um

08:09:10.000 --> 08:09:12.718
Caption: and

08:09:11.519 --> 08:09:14.556
Caption: i think

08:09:12.718 --> 08:09:17.041
Caption: with hindsight we would say no that that

08:09:14.558 --> 08:09:20.478
Caption: isn&#39;t the case because people have

08:09:17.039 --> 08:09:22.238
Caption: improved upon existing ways to simulate

08:09:20.478 --> 08:09:24.558
Caption: quantum computers

08:09:22.240 --> 08:09:26.080
Caption: that can easily replicate what google

08:09:24.558 --> 08:09:27.601
Caption: did on their devices

08:09:26.080 --> 08:09:29.519
Caption: so it&#39;s a sort of

08:09:27.599 --> 08:09:31.759
Caption: at the moment we&#39;re at this sort of cusp

08:09:29.519 --> 08:09:31.759
Caption: where

08:09:32.878 --> 08:09:36.000
Caption: increasing the capacity of quantum

08:09:34.240 --> 08:09:37.599
Caption: technology

08:09:36.000 --> 08:09:38.878
Caption: provides a challenge for conventional

08:09:37.599 --> 08:09:39.839
Caption: technology

08:09:38.878 --> 08:09:41.841
Caption: that

08:09:39.839 --> 08:09:43.519
Caption: may easily may be easy to overcome

08:09:41.839 --> 08:09:44.876
Caption: because you know

08:09:43.519 --> 08:09:46.636
Caption: this isn&#39;t something that people think

08:09:44.878 --> 08:09:50.080
Caption: about all the time so not a lot of

08:09:46.638 --> 08:09:50.080
Caption: effort has been put into

08:09:50.160 --> 08:09:52.718
Caption: simulating

08:09:51.519 --> 08:09:55.679
Caption: circuits that are built of

08:09:52.718 --> 08:09:57.681
Caption: superconductors for example but you know

08:09:55.679 --> 08:09:58.796
Caption: when smart people go and and try to

08:09:57.679 --> 08:10:00.240
Caption: figure it out

08:09:58.798 --> 08:10:02.478
Caption: it turns out that

08:10:00.240 --> 08:10:05.519
Caption: it can be done but eventually

08:10:02.478 --> 08:10:07.441
Caption: it&#39;ll just be impossible there will be

08:10:05.519 --> 08:10:09.679
Caption: if you think about it this way

08:10:07.439 --> 08:10:10.796
Caption: if you could build the device with 300

08:10:09.679 --> 08:10:12.796
Caption: qubits

08:10:10.798 --> 08:10:15.281
Caption: then the number of possible states in

08:10:12.798 --> 08:10:16.398
Caption: that superposition that i showed you

08:10:15.279 --> 08:10:19.519
Caption: would be more than the number of

08:10:16.398 --> 08:10:21.919
Caption: particles in the universe so

08:10:19.519 --> 08:10:24.160
Caption: we won&#39;t be able to do it with with bits

08:10:21.919 --> 08:10:26.320
Caption: of information at some point

08:10:24.160 --> 08:10:28.240
Caption: where that point is i don&#39;t know it&#39;s

08:10:26.320 --> 08:10:30.398
Caption: you know it it could be now

08:10:28.240 --> 08:10:31.679
Caption: it could have been two years ago

08:10:30.398 --> 08:10:32.958
Caption: but

08:10:31.679 --> 08:10:35.599
Caption: yeah

08:10:32.957 --> 08:10:38.476
Caption: i&#39;ll also point out that

08:10:35.599 --> 08:10:40.876
Caption: they&#39;re just trying to demonstrate that

08:10:38.478 --> 08:10:43.441
Caption: their device can do something that

08:10:40.878 --> 08:10:45.841
Caption: conventional technology can&#39;t simulate

08:10:43.439 --> 08:10:48.396
Caption: like i can&#39;t use a conventional computer

08:10:45.839 --> 08:10:49.519
Caption: to simulate what that device did

08:10:48.398 --> 08:10:51.679
Caption: that

08:10:49.519 --> 08:10:53.359
Caption: that thing that the device that did was

08:10:51.679 --> 08:10:56.558
Caption: wasn&#39;t useful for anything other than to

08:10:53.359 --> 08:10:58.796
Caption: demonstrate that one thing so

08:10:56.558 --> 08:11:00.638
Caption: it&#39;s not like it was solving actual real

08:10:58.798 --> 08:11:02.000
Caption: world problems or anything we&#39;re not

08:11:00.638 --> 08:11:05.601
Caption: there yet that&#39;s going to require

08:11:02.000 --> 08:11:05.599
Caption: thousands to millions of

08:11:10.839 --> 08:11:15.599
Caption: qubits there any other questions

08:11:14.638 --> 08:11:16.718
Caption: no

08:11:15.599 --> 08:11:17.519
Caption: hi

08:11:16.718 --> 08:11:19.601
Caption: oh

08:11:17.519 --> 08:11:23.716
Caption: we need a microphone

08:11:19.599 --> 08:11:23.716
Caption: there&#39;s one coming from behind you

08:11:28.080 --> 08:11:32.478
Caption: quantum computer handle memory leakages

08:11:30.878 --> 08:11:35.361
Caption: sorry can you say it again can a quantum

08:11:32.478 --> 08:11:37.521
Caption: computer handle memory leakages like we

08:11:35.359 --> 08:11:39.759
Caption: face a lot of memory leakage issues in

08:11:37.519 --> 08:11:41.759
Caption: classical computers so can a quantum

08:11:39.759 --> 08:11:44.160
Caption: computer handle that

08:11:41.759 --> 08:11:45.119
Caption: um so a quantum

08:11:44.160 --> 08:11:47.279
Caption: so

08:11:45.119 --> 08:11:48.796
Caption: there are

08:11:47.279 --> 08:11:50.957
Caption: there&#39;s a there&#39;s a website it&#39;s called

08:11:48.798 --> 08:11:52.398
Caption: the quantum algorithm zoo

08:11:50.957 --> 08:11:54.796
Caption: and it has

08:11:52.398 --> 08:11:56.240
Caption: a couple dozen

08:11:54.798 --> 08:11:58.478
Caption: problems

08:11:56.240 --> 08:12:00.878
Caption: that

08:11:58.478 --> 08:12:02.080
Caption: quantum quantum algorithms exist for

08:12:00.878 --> 08:12:03.121
Caption: that are better

08:12:02.080 --> 08:12:06.080
Caption: than

08:12:03.119 --> 08:12:07.039
Caption: known classical algorithms

08:12:06.080 --> 08:12:08.718
Caption: but

08:12:07.039 --> 08:12:11.199
Caption: standard things like representing data

08:12:08.718 --> 08:12:13.761
Caption: adding numbers things like that the the

08:12:11.199 --> 08:12:16.716
Caption: overhead actually makes it worse so a

08:12:13.759 --> 08:12:18.876
Caption: quantum computer won&#39;t be better than a

08:12:16.718 --> 08:12:20.958
Caption: classical computer at everything

08:12:18.878 --> 08:12:23.681
Caption: there are a few special problems for

08:12:20.957 --> 08:12:25.519
Caption: which that kind of new data

08:12:23.679 --> 08:12:27.199
Caption: is a more natural or better

08:12:25.519 --> 08:12:28.000
Caption: representation

08:12:27.199 --> 08:12:30.318
Caption: yeah

08:12:28.000 --> 08:12:30.320
Caption: thank you

08:12:31.199 --> 08:12:34.759
Caption: i think it was up here

08:12:39.359 --> 08:12:42.000
Caption: hi

08:12:40.080 --> 08:12:45.359
Caption: um thanks for the talk that was really

08:12:42.000 --> 08:12:47.599
Caption: fascinating um so i have a question uh

08:12:45.359 --> 08:12:49.439
Caption: realistically in the future how do you

08:12:47.599 --> 08:12:51.119
Caption: see quantum computers are being used

08:12:49.439 --> 08:12:53.199
Caption: will they replace all traditional

08:12:51.119 --> 08:12:56.158
Caption: alternatives that we use now

08:12:53.199 --> 08:12:58.476
Caption: and if so what are the top three

08:12:56.160 --> 08:13:00.000
Caption: problems that humanity needs to solve in

08:12:58.478 --> 08:13:02.080
Caption: order to achieve that

08:13:00.000 --> 08:13:04.000
Caption: thank you right

08:13:02.080 --> 08:13:05.041
Caption: so i think the way that it will progress

08:13:04.000 --> 08:13:06.320
Caption: is

08:13:05.039 --> 08:13:08.238
Caption: um

08:13:06.320 --> 08:13:09.439
Caption: first we&#39;ll see

08:13:08.240 --> 08:13:11.919
Caption: a cloud

08:13:09.439 --> 08:13:14.796
Caption: cloud-based devices because there will

08:13:11.919 --> 08:13:17.679
Caption: be there&#39;ll be a very few of them

08:13:14.798 --> 08:13:18.558
Caption: and they also require

08:13:17.679 --> 08:13:20.398
Caption: a

08:13:18.558 --> 08:13:21.281
Caption: if we don&#39;t make

08:13:20.398 --> 08:13:23.121
Caption: you know

08:13:21.279 --> 08:13:25.359
Caption: basically nobel prize winning

08:13:23.119 --> 08:13:28.158
Caption: improvements in materials

08:13:25.359 --> 08:13:29.279
Caption: these things re require extreme

08:13:28.160 --> 08:13:32.160
Caption: environments

08:13:29.279 --> 08:13:33.519
Caption: so ultra high vacuum like fewer fewer

08:13:32.160 --> 08:13:34.478
Caption: particles than you would find in outer

08:13:33.519 --> 08:13:35.359
Caption: space

08:13:34.478 --> 08:13:37.521
Caption: or

08:13:35.359 --> 08:13:38.476
Caption: cools with liquid helium which makes

08:13:37.519 --> 08:13:40.240
Caption: these

08:13:38.478 --> 08:13:42.160
Caption: these sort of refrigerators that they&#39;re

08:13:40.240 --> 08:13:44.160
Caption: housed in the coldest places in the

08:13:42.160 --> 08:13:46.240
Caption: universe

08:13:44.160 --> 08:13:48.878
Caption: you don&#39;t you don&#39;t want your average

08:13:46.240 --> 08:13:49.919
Caption: consumer i think to have to handle that

08:13:48.878 --> 08:13:51.521
Caption: um

08:13:49.919 --> 08:13:53.519
Caption: so there&#39;ll be cloud-based devices

08:13:51.519 --> 08:13:54.957
Caption: initially

08:13:53.519 --> 08:13:56.398
Caption: um

08:13:54.957 --> 08:13:58.476
Caption: but

08:13:56.398 --> 08:14:01.759
Caption: even if we end up

08:13:58.478 --> 08:14:04.080
Caption: finding a way to miniaturize it and make

08:14:01.759 --> 08:14:06.160
Caption: it work at room temperature

08:14:04.080 --> 08:14:08.718
Caption: they&#39;ll still be special purpose

08:14:06.160 --> 08:14:10.718
Caption: components it&#39;ll be like

08:14:08.718 --> 08:14:13.601
Caption: you know you have your gpu and maybe you

08:14:10.718 --> 08:14:14.558
Caption: have your tpu and you&#39;ll have your qpu

08:14:13.599 --> 08:14:16.876
Caption: all

08:14:14.558 --> 08:14:18.638
Caption: you know handled by

08:14:16.878 --> 08:14:21.041
Caption: you know your existing computer your

08:14:18.638 --> 08:14:23.441
Caption: existing cpu will just outsource

08:14:21.039 --> 08:14:25.279
Caption: particular calculations that it knows

08:14:23.439 --> 08:14:27.759
Caption: will be more efficiently run on the

08:14:25.279 --> 08:14:30.636
Caption: quantum processor

08:14:27.759 --> 08:14:32.320
Caption: oh and you had the other question so i

08:14:30.638 --> 08:14:35.441
Caption: don&#39;t think it&#39;ll ever be used to break

08:14:32.320 --> 08:14:35.439
Caption: rsa because

08:14:35.599 --> 08:14:40.398
Caption: we&#39;ll move beyond uh we&#39;ll move beyond

08:14:38.240 --> 08:14:43.041
Caption: that

08:14:40.398 --> 08:14:44.718
Caption: the most promising application

08:14:43.039 --> 08:14:46.476
Caption: is

08:14:44.718 --> 08:14:48.160
Caption: using quantum

08:14:46.478 --> 08:14:49.759
Caption: systems to simulate other quantum

08:14:48.160 --> 08:14:51.679
Caption: systems

08:14:49.759 --> 08:14:53.759
Caption: so right now

08:14:51.679 --> 08:14:55.039
Caption: it&#39;s very difficult to simulate chemical

08:14:53.759 --> 08:14:57.359
Caption: interactions

08:14:55.039 --> 08:14:58.957
Caption: just because again as i said

08:14:57.359 --> 08:15:01.279
Caption: you know a chemical might have more than

08:14:58.957 --> 08:15:03.039
Caption: 300 atoms in it and so the number of

08:15:01.279 --> 08:15:04.716
Caption: states it can be in is

08:15:03.039 --> 08:15:05.759
Caption: more than the number of particles in the

08:15:04.718 --> 08:15:07.839
Caption: universe so

08:15:05.759 --> 08:15:10.876
Caption: conventional technology has a real hard

08:15:07.839 --> 08:15:12.240
Caption: time representing that rich data

08:15:10.878 --> 08:15:14.080
Caption: with bits

08:15:12.240 --> 08:15:16.478
Caption: and so when you&#39;re designing

08:15:14.080 --> 08:15:19.759
Caption: vaccines and drugs and stuff

08:15:16.478 --> 08:15:21.839
Caption: you&#39;re you can do some heuristic

08:15:19.759 --> 08:15:24.638
Caption: things and you can do really coarse

08:15:21.839 --> 08:15:27.199
Caption: grain simulations but ultimately

08:15:24.638 --> 08:15:28.478
Caption: you have to make a guess

08:15:27.199 --> 08:15:30.636
Caption: build the drug

08:15:28.478 --> 08:15:32.240
Caption: stick it mice find out what happens

08:15:30.638 --> 08:15:35.121
Caption: right

08:15:32.240 --> 08:15:36.638
Caption: in the future if we&#39;re able to simulate

08:15:35.119 --> 08:15:38.796
Caption: the interaction between biological

08:15:36.638 --> 08:15:40.798
Caption: models in a virtual environment

08:15:38.798 --> 08:15:43.361
Caption: then that will just that would be truly

08:15:40.798 --> 08:15:46.638
Caption: transformational we&#39;ll be able to design

08:15:43.359 --> 08:15:48.556
Caption: new drugs new vaccines new materials

08:15:46.638 --> 08:15:51.041
Caption: all in a virtual environment before we

08:15:48.558 --> 08:15:52.320
Caption: have to go out and spend the money

08:15:51.039 --> 08:15:54.796
Caption: to

08:15:52.320 --> 08:15:56.798
Caption: build the actual thing

08:15:54.798 --> 08:16:00.718
Caption: i think that&#39;ll be the number one

08:15:56.798 --> 08:16:00.718
Caption: uh yeah the number one application

08:16:03.599 --> 08:16:07.759
Caption: where&#39;s the microphone i can&#39;t see oh

08:16:06.160 --> 08:16:09.759
Caption: here

08:16:07.759 --> 08:16:11.679
Caption: um how come you didn&#39;t say study physics

08:16:09.759 --> 08:16:14.160
Caption: as a prerequisite to getting into

08:16:11.679 --> 08:16:15.439
Caption: quantum computing

08:16:14.160 --> 08:16:18.080
Caption: so

08:16:15.439 --> 08:16:19.519
Caption: as in quantum mechanics so study

08:16:18.080 --> 08:16:21.359
Caption: physics physics background have a

08:16:19.519 --> 08:16:23.039
Caption: physics degree it&#39;s like studying

08:16:21.359 --> 08:16:26.396
Caption: computer science to do programming et

08:16:23.039 --> 08:16:28.636
Caption: cetera so fundamentals

08:16:26.398 --> 08:16:30.558
Caption: i think i mean that&#39;s just a historical

08:16:28.638 --> 08:16:32.240
Caption: quirk that the people who invented the

08:16:30.558 --> 08:16:34.958
Caption: field were physicists

08:16:32.240 --> 08:16:38.398
Caption: and so the language and jargon is all

08:16:34.957 --> 08:16:40.716
Caption: physics jargon but that&#39;s changing so at

08:16:38.398 --> 08:16:42.000
Caption: the university of technology sydney

08:16:40.718 --> 08:16:44.160
Caption: you can

08:16:42.000 --> 08:16:45.119
Caption: get a bachelor of computer science and

08:16:44.160 --> 08:16:47.519
Caption: major

08:16:45.119 --> 08:16:49.039
Caption: in quantum computation so i teach

08:16:47.519 --> 08:16:50.556
Caption: introduction to quantum computation to

08:16:49.039 --> 08:16:52.238
Caption: people who&#39;ve never taken a physics

08:16:50.558 --> 08:16:54.478
Caption: course at all

08:16:52.240 --> 08:16:57.201
Caption: there&#39;s no physics jargon

08:16:54.478 --> 08:16:59.441
Caption: in it and we start with programming

08:16:57.199 --> 08:17:01.759
Caption: we build a quantum tic-tac-toe game and

08:16:59.439 --> 08:17:02.957
Caption: we run it on a quantum computer

08:17:01.759 --> 08:17:04.716
Caption: and

08:17:02.957 --> 08:17:06.556
Caption: they don&#39;t need to

08:17:04.718 --> 08:17:08.718
Caption: i mean i could do it without even using

08:17:06.558 --> 08:17:10.798
Caption: the word superposition and entanglement

08:17:08.718 --> 08:17:12.878
Caption: you know once you just specify the rules

08:17:10.798 --> 08:17:14.558
Caption: and the grammar and the syntax of the

08:17:12.878 --> 08:17:17.841
Caption: quantum programming language then it&#39;s

08:17:14.558 --> 08:17:17.839
Caption: just like any other computer science

08:17:20.240 --> 08:17:25.439
Caption: did the microphone

08:17:22.878 --> 08:17:29.121
Caption: hello um so schrodinger&#39;s cat

08:17:25.439 --> 08:17:30.957
Caption: represented an era of quantum computing

08:17:29.119 --> 08:17:32.556
Caption: where we had leaps and bounds and

08:17:30.957 --> 08:17:35.679
Caption: discovery and understanding but that was

08:17:32.558 --> 08:17:38.718
Caption: like the 20s like 1920s and 1930s what

08:17:35.679 --> 08:17:41.119
Caption: do you think is next for quantum theory

08:17:38.718 --> 08:17:44.478
Caption: like the next big thing

08:17:41.119 --> 08:17:46.318
Caption: oh that&#39;s a good question um

08:17:44.478 --> 08:17:47.839
Caption: so the

08:17:46.320 --> 08:17:51.041
Caption: you know the questions that schrodinger

08:17:47.839 --> 08:17:52.796
Caption: raised are unresolved um

08:17:51.039 --> 08:17:54.636
Caption: you know we don&#39;t

08:17:52.798 --> 08:17:56.080
Caption: we don&#39;t really know what the nature of

08:17:54.638 --> 08:17:58.798
Caption: reality is we know that quantum

08:17:56.080 --> 08:18:00.798
Caption: mechanics is wrong in some sense

08:17:58.798 --> 08:18:02.878
Caption: we have two main

08:18:00.798 --> 08:18:04.878
Caption: theories in physics einstein&#39;s theory of

08:18:02.878 --> 08:18:06.320
Caption: general relativity which works for large

08:18:04.878 --> 08:18:08.558
Caption: scale things

08:18:06.320 --> 08:18:10.398
Caption: and quantum mechanics which works for

08:18:08.558 --> 08:18:13.441
Caption: small scale things

08:18:10.398 --> 08:18:14.398
Caption: and they&#39;re completely incompatible

08:18:13.439 --> 08:18:16.320
Caption: so

08:18:14.398 --> 08:18:18.558
Caption: one of them&#39;s wrong or they&#39;re both

08:18:16.320 --> 08:18:19.359
Caption: wrong which is the more likely scenario

08:18:18.558 --> 08:18:20.080
Caption: uh

08:18:19.359 --> 08:18:22.000
Caption: and

08:18:20.080 --> 08:18:24.478
Caption: that&#39;s kind of what most

08:18:22.000 --> 08:18:27.119
Caption: theoretical physicists think about at

08:18:24.478 --> 08:18:28.478
Caption: least the ones that um

08:18:27.119 --> 08:18:30.716
Caption: have tenure

08:18:28.478 --> 08:18:30.718
Caption: they

08:18:32.878 --> 08:18:36.000
Caption: they they think about

08:18:34.798 --> 08:18:37.521
Caption: how do you bring these two things

08:18:36.000 --> 08:18:40.160
Caption: together you know it&#39;s what einstein

08:18:37.519 --> 08:18:41.759
Caption: spent the most of his life trying to

08:18:40.160 --> 08:18:43.279
Caption: figure out

08:18:41.759 --> 08:18:45.919
Caption: i mean he kind of invented both of the

08:18:43.279 --> 08:18:49.199
Caption: theories um and then spent the rest of

08:18:45.919 --> 08:18:49.199
Caption: his life trying to put them together

08:18:49.599 --> 08:18:53.599
Caption: so doing that or coming up with a

08:18:51.359 --> 08:18:56.396
Caption: completely new theory that supersedes

08:18:53.599 --> 08:18:58.398
Caption: both general relativity and quantum

08:18:56.398 --> 08:19:01.041
Caption: mechanics and you can get some pretty

08:18:58.398 --> 08:19:03.599
Caption: wild speculations like the universe is a

08:19:01.039 --> 08:19:06.158
Caption: hologram

08:19:03.599 --> 08:19:09.199
Caption: or you know a black hole is really a

08:19:06.160 --> 08:19:10.558
Caption: quantum computer these sorts of things

08:19:09.199 --> 08:19:13.359
Caption: are what people talk about at

08:19:10.558 --> 08:19:14.320
Caption: theoretical physics conferences

08:19:13.359 --> 08:19:16.957
Caption: i

08:19:14.320 --> 08:19:18.638
Caption: i yeah

08:19:16.957 --> 08:19:20.000
Caption: i guess i&#39;m not old and cranky enough to

08:19:18.638 --> 08:19:21.521
Caption: think about that sort of stuff i still

08:19:20.000 --> 08:19:23.359
Caption: write

08:19:21.519 --> 08:19:26.000
Caption: i just write research grants in

08:19:23.359 --> 08:19:26.000
Caption: children&#39;s books

08:19:32.000 --> 08:19:35.398
Caption: any other questions

08:19:37.599 --> 08:19:40.398
Caption: there&#39;s one down here

08:19:41.439 --> 08:19:47.199
Caption: oh and there&#39;s one over there

08:19:42.960 --> 08:19:49.121
Caption: [Laughter]

08:19:47.199 --> 08:19:52.000
Caption: uh thanks for your talk i was going to

08:19:49.119 --> 08:19:53.439
Caption: change tech and talk about your

08:19:52.000 --> 08:19:55.199
Caption: you know being an author for children

08:19:53.439 --> 08:19:56.957
Caption: can you describe

08:19:55.199 --> 08:19:59.679
Caption: a bit of your creative process from

08:19:56.957 --> 08:20:02.078
Caption: being a scientist to then communicating

08:19:59.679 --> 08:20:03.679
Caption: what are quite you know obscure or

08:20:02.080 --> 08:20:06.160
Caption: perhaps esoteric

08:20:03.679 --> 08:20:07.599
Caption: concepts to such a junior audience i

08:20:06.160 --> 08:20:10.398
Caption: mean what do you

08:20:07.599 --> 08:20:12.957
Caption: how do you even start that process

08:20:10.398 --> 08:20:15.121
Caption: yeah so i think

08:20:12.957 --> 08:20:18.556
Caption: the motivation obviously was

08:20:15.119 --> 08:20:19.359
Caption: to for my to read to my own kids so i

08:20:18.558 --> 08:20:21.441
Caption: have

08:20:19.359 --> 08:20:23.439
Caption: four children and

08:20:21.439 --> 08:20:25.279
Caption: i wanted to

08:20:23.439 --> 08:20:26.240
Caption: read science books to them

08:20:25.279 --> 08:20:28.716
Caption: and

08:20:26.240 --> 08:20:30.558
Caption: this was maybe eight years ago

08:20:28.718 --> 08:20:32.398
Caption: it didn&#39;t really exist

08:20:30.558 --> 08:20:34.638
Caption: so i thought well i&#39;ll just try to do it

08:20:32.398 --> 08:20:36.638
Caption: myself and and

08:20:34.638 --> 08:20:38.398
Caption: what better thing to write about for

08:20:36.638 --> 08:20:40.320
Caption: children than quantum physics and so i

08:20:38.398 --> 08:20:42.958
Caption: wrote

08:20:40.320 --> 08:20:44.839
Caption: i wrote quantum physics for babies and

08:20:42.957 --> 08:20:48.636
Caption: um

08:20:44.839 --> 08:20:52.478
Caption: and i i kind of approached it

08:20:48.638 --> 08:20:54.160
Caption: as i would my my own sort of teaching so

08:20:52.478 --> 08:20:56.160
Caption: i don&#39;t really

08:20:54.160 --> 08:20:58.958
Caption: distinguish between an audience of

08:20:56.160 --> 08:21:01.839
Caption: physicists and audience of children um

08:20:58.957 --> 08:21:01.839
Caption: you know just

08:21:02.320 --> 08:21:07.519
Caption: keep it simple

08:21:04.080 --> 08:21:09.119
Caption: and use bright diagrams

08:21:07.519 --> 08:21:11.679
Caption: um

08:21:09.119 --> 08:21:14.158
Caption: yeah and so i did that and it seemed to

08:21:11.679 --> 08:21:17.119
Caption: work out and some of the other like the

08:21:14.160 --> 08:21:18.240
Caption: book here was kind of modeled um loosely

08:21:17.119 --> 08:21:20.158
Caption: on

08:21:18.240 --> 08:21:21.599
Caption: um you know the cat

08:21:20.160 --> 08:21:22.398
Caption: the cat in the hat

08:21:21.599 --> 08:21:24.636
Caption: um

08:21:22.398 --> 08:21:26.558
Caption: although

08:21:24.638 --> 08:21:28.638
Caption: this isn&#39;t going to go live this is oh

08:21:26.558 --> 08:21:30.718
Caption: it is live

08:21:28.638 --> 08:21:34.798
Caption: so if the dr seuss foundation is

08:21:30.718 --> 08:21:37.441
Caption: listening you didn&#39;t hear that part um

08:21:34.798 --> 08:21:39.919
Caption: so i you know as a physicist or as a

08:21:37.439 --> 08:21:42.556
Caption: scientist you you&#39;re just

08:21:39.919 --> 08:21:44.478
Caption: naturally attuned to taking things that

08:21:42.558 --> 08:21:46.718
Caption: people have built

08:21:44.478 --> 08:21:48.478
Caption: and and simplifying them or looking at

08:21:46.718 --> 08:21:50.000
Caption: them in a different way or building upon

08:21:48.478 --> 08:21:51.441
Caption: them

08:21:50.000 --> 08:21:52.798
Caption: usually to make them better now i don&#39;t

08:21:51.439 --> 08:21:54.396
Caption: want to say that i made something better

08:21:52.798 --> 08:21:55.681
Caption: than dr seuss but

08:21:54.398 --> 08:21:58.160
Caption: the point is

08:21:55.679 --> 08:21:59.519
Caption: it&#39;s much easier to take something that

08:21:58.160 --> 08:22:02.080
Caption: exists

08:21:59.519 --> 08:22:03.839
Caption: and then put your own spin or

08:22:02.080 --> 08:22:05.599
Caption: improvement upon it and that&#39;s kind of

08:22:03.839 --> 08:22:07.839
Caption: what scientists do all the time nobody

08:22:05.599 --> 08:22:09.919
Caption: just invents a theory in vacuum right

08:22:07.839 --> 08:22:11.839
Caption: they they build upon the previous thing

08:22:09.919 --> 08:22:14.000
Caption: it&#39;s all incremental and so for me it

08:22:11.839 --> 08:22:16.160
Caption: seems really like it&#39;s just a natural

08:22:14.000 --> 08:22:17.919
Caption: thing for me to do to say

08:22:16.160 --> 08:22:19.439
Caption: take something that exists and i know

08:22:17.919 --> 08:22:25.000
Caption: that works well

08:22:19.439 --> 08:22:25.000
Caption: and then add my own flavor to it

08:22:27.359 --> 08:22:31.119
Caption: um

08:22:28.638 --> 08:22:32.718
Caption: so like we see like say a ai in the last

08:22:31.119 --> 08:22:35.359
Caption: 10 years there&#39;s been a lot of like

08:22:32.718 --> 08:22:37.681
Caption: debates about ethics ethical cool

08:22:35.359 --> 08:22:39.679
Caption: problems and such is there anything any

08:22:37.679 --> 08:22:41.599
Caption: um debates of that saw in the quantum

08:22:39.679 --> 08:22:44.160
Caption: world

08:22:41.599 --> 08:22:45.039
Caption: it is it&#39;s very uh there&#39;s not a lot of

08:22:44.160 --> 08:22:47.759
Caption: people

08:22:45.039 --> 08:22:48.636
Caption: thinking about it um

08:22:47.759 --> 08:22:49.679
Caption: so

08:22:48.638 --> 08:22:51.441
Caption: yeah

08:22:49.679 --> 08:22:54.478
Caption: i think there was a white paper about

08:22:51.439 --> 08:22:54.476
Caption: about quantum ethics

08:22:54.957 --> 08:22:58.636
Caption: and

08:22:56.160 --> 08:23:00.558
Caption: you know it&#39;s largely inspired by the

08:22:58.638 --> 08:23:02.080
Caption: debate in ai

08:23:00.558 --> 08:23:03.919
Caption: and

08:23:02.080 --> 08:23:07.439
Caption: the argument is let&#39;s get on top of this

08:23:03.919 --> 08:23:08.718
Caption: now or we&#39;re going to end up like ai

08:23:07.439 --> 08:23:10.000
Caption: with a whole bunch of things to fix in

08:23:08.718 --> 08:23:11.121
Caption: the future

08:23:10.000 --> 08:23:12.478
Caption: um

08:23:11.119 --> 08:23:14.158
Caption: but

08:23:12.478 --> 08:23:15.679
Caption: you know without

08:23:14.160 --> 08:23:18.160
Caption: i think

08:23:15.679 --> 08:23:21.439
Caption: really you can you we&#39;re watching an

08:23:18.160 --> 08:23:24.398
Caption: experiment right and the hypothesis is

08:23:21.439 --> 08:23:26.396
Caption: does money talk and yes it does

08:23:24.398 --> 08:23:27.599
Caption: so there&#39;s no money being put into that

08:23:26.398 --> 08:23:29.679
Caption: effort

08:23:27.599 --> 08:23:31.199
Caption: and there&#39;s money being put into just

08:23:29.679 --> 08:23:32.957
Caption: going and moving forward as fast as

08:23:31.199 --> 08:23:36.238
Caption: possible

08:23:32.957 --> 08:23:39.759
Caption: so it&#39;s it&#39;s going to be a challenge

08:23:36.240 --> 08:23:40.878
Caption: um i my suspicion is like most things

08:23:39.759 --> 08:23:42.716
Caption: are just

08:23:40.878 --> 08:23:44.080
Caption: we&#39;re going to forge ahead with a lot of

08:23:42.718 --> 08:23:46.240
Caption: stuff to clean up

08:23:44.080 --> 08:23:47.599
Caption: afterward but there is

08:23:46.240 --> 08:23:48.638
Caption: there is

08:23:47.599 --> 08:23:50.636
Caption: so

08:23:48.638 --> 08:23:51.759
Caption: one of the one of the differences

08:23:50.638 --> 08:23:54.478
Caption: is that

08:23:51.759 --> 08:23:57.679
Caption: the promise of quantum technology

08:23:54.478 --> 08:23:59.839
Caption: and the likely path forward is that

08:23:57.679 --> 08:24:02.240
Caption: at some point in the future there&#39;ll be

08:23:59.839 --> 08:24:04.478
Caption: only a handful of these devices and

08:24:02.240 --> 08:24:07.359
Caption: they&#39;ll be extremely powerful

08:24:04.478 --> 08:24:08.878
Caption: like they can break rsa

08:24:07.359 --> 08:24:10.796
Caption: so

08:24:08.878 --> 08:24:13.841
Caption: there won&#39;t be democratic access to

08:24:10.798 --> 08:24:13.841
Caption: these these things

08:24:14.000 --> 08:24:19.199
Caption: because of the way things are structured

08:24:16.558 --> 08:24:20.398
Caption: and so that that&#39;s sort of the the major

08:24:19.199 --> 08:24:22.957
Caption: difference

08:24:20.398 --> 08:24:24.000
Caption: um in the debate

08:24:22.957 --> 08:24:26.636
Caption: between

08:24:24.000 --> 08:24:28.000
Caption: quantum ethics and ai ethics

08:24:26.638 --> 08:24:30.080
Caption: but certainly

08:24:28.000 --> 08:24:32.798
Caption: something that people think about it&#39;s

08:24:30.080 --> 08:24:32.798
Caption: just not enough

08:24:36.398 --> 08:24:39.798
Caption: any more questions

08:24:46.558 --> 08:24:50.878
Caption: i see one

08:24:47.839 --> 08:24:53.039
Caption: just kind of following up from that uh

08:24:50.878 --> 08:24:55.441
Caption: what you&#39;re just talking about um so

08:24:53.039 --> 08:24:58.000
Caption: what does a career like look like in

08:24:55.439 --> 08:24:59.279
Caption: quantum computing for let&#39;s say a

08:24:58.000 --> 08:25:00.798
Caption: student going through one of your

08:24:59.279 --> 08:25:02.556
Caption: classes right now

08:25:00.798 --> 08:25:04.398
Caption: what is the let&#39;s just say they&#39;re in

08:25:02.558 --> 08:25:06.240
Caption: their 20s and they&#39;re going to spend an

08:25:04.398 --> 08:25:08.320
Caption: entire career what do you what do you

08:25:06.240 --> 08:25:10.878
Caption: think it would look like

08:25:08.320 --> 08:25:11.759
Caption: yeah so the quantum industry is large

08:25:10.878 --> 08:25:13.521
Caption: enough

08:25:11.759 --> 08:25:15.359
Caption: at this point

08:25:13.519 --> 08:25:17.119
Caption: that the majority of people that are in

08:25:15.359 --> 08:25:19.439
Caption: it

08:25:17.119 --> 08:25:21.359
Caption: don&#39;t really know anything about quantum

08:25:19.439 --> 08:25:22.476
Caption: computing at all so

08:25:21.359 --> 08:25:24.957
Caption: you know

08:25:22.478 --> 08:25:26.798
Caption: a quantum computing company

08:25:24.957 --> 08:25:28.556
Caption: say a quantum startup company

08:25:26.798 --> 08:25:29.281
Caption: needs to have a website

08:25:28.558 --> 08:25:32.240
Caption: so

08:25:29.279 --> 08:25:33.599
Caption: it needs web designers right uh

08:25:32.240 --> 08:25:34.478
Caption: and

08:25:33.599 --> 08:25:36.000
Caption: i

08:25:34.478 --> 08:25:39.919
Caption: i work closely with a couple quantum

08:25:36.000 --> 08:25:42.160
Caption: startups and you need remarkably little

08:25:39.919 --> 08:25:43.359
Caption: knowledge about quantum computing to

08:25:42.160 --> 08:25:45.599
Caption: if you have

08:25:43.359 --> 08:25:47.919
Caption: if you&#39;re a talented developer

08:25:45.599 --> 08:25:51.359
Caption: then you can learn all all you need to

08:25:47.919 --> 08:25:51.359
Caption: know on the on the job

08:25:51.759 --> 08:25:54.558
Caption: in

08:25:52.638 --> 08:25:56.080
Caption: so in our

08:25:54.558 --> 08:26:00.558
Caption: degree program there&#39;s kind of two

08:25:56.080 --> 08:26:02.718
Caption: pathways there&#39;s sort of the honors

08:26:00.558 --> 08:26:03.601
Caption: higher education pathway so if you want

08:26:02.718 --> 08:26:05.839
Caption: to be

08:26:03.599 --> 08:26:07.039
Caption: like a research scientist at a quantum

08:26:05.839 --> 08:26:08.796
Caption: company

08:26:07.039 --> 08:26:12.876
Caption: then you still need

08:26:08.798 --> 08:26:12.878
Caption: some some higher degree probably a phd

08:26:13.039 --> 08:26:16.396
Caption: but then there&#39;s sort of the technology

08:26:14.878 --> 08:26:17.681
Caption: pathway

08:26:16.398 --> 08:26:20.000
Caption: where

08:26:17.679 --> 08:26:22.240
Caption: you will be a computer scientist

08:26:20.000 --> 08:26:23.759
Caption: but the quantum company won&#39;t have to

08:26:22.240 --> 08:26:24.958
Caption: spend eight months

08:26:23.759 --> 08:26:26.716
Caption: on some

08:26:24.957 --> 08:26:28.716
Caption: special induction about

08:26:26.718 --> 08:26:31.201
Caption: about quantum computing for you so

08:26:28.718 --> 08:26:33.041
Caption: you&#39;ll already be kind of well-versed in

08:26:31.199 --> 08:26:35.599
Caption: all of the language and lingo and

08:26:33.039 --> 08:26:37.599
Caption: nuances that you would otherwise have to

08:26:35.599 --> 08:26:39.039
Caption: learn on the job but i speak to people

08:26:37.599 --> 08:26:40.796
Caption: who work at quantum

08:26:39.039 --> 08:26:41.599
Caption: startup companies
