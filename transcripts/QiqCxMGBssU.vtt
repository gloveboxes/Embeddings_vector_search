Caption: developer that deeply cares about a good

00:00:52.648 --> 00:00:58.948
Caption: workplace culture in order to go to work

00:00:54.959 --> 00:01:01.759
Caption: happy recently I reflected on my career

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.308
Caption: of 10 years plus in web development and

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:08.188
Caption: when I did that I kind of realized

00:01:05.308 --> 00:01:11.250
Caption: there&#39;s always been one each workplace

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.439
Caption: that vina had a toxic developer being in

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.680
Caption: the form of a fellow team member or even

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.270
Caption: a superior based on my personal

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.959
Caption: experiences I would like to share my

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:32.368
Caption: learnings with you today what is a toxic

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:35.250
Caption: developer oh sorry how&#39;s this possible

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.320
Caption: I&#39;m so sorry anyway my aim is to raise

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.540
Caption: awareness of toxic behavior in the

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:48.709
Caption: workplace and the impact it has on you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:48.709
Caption: and your work threw me off now sorry

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:55.139
Caption: it&#39;s sorry what is it talks develop

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:58.500
Caption: let&#39;s continue toxicity by definition

00:01:55.139 --> 00:02:01.529
Caption: means the quality state or relative

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.729
Caption: degree of something being poisonous but

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:05.009
Caption: there are actually a lot of different

00:02:02.728 --> 00:02:06.989
Caption: traits a toxic developer can have and

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.039
Caption: some of them actually might surprise you

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:12.099
Caption: let&#39;s explore a few of them as you can

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.960
Caption: see

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.090
Caption: a lot of different trades on here and

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.760
Caption: collectively we could actually think of

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:21.309
Caption: many more I&#39;m sure but what I would like

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:24.179
Caption: to highlight is that any of these traits

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:26.399
Caption: individually and in small doses does not

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:30.729
Caption: necessarily make a toxic developer

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:33.669
Caption: however someone who exhibits many of

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:38.409
Caption: these traits or two extreme levels might

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:41.759
Caption: have a more toxic effect on others given

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.279
Caption: this we have learnt our toxic developers

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:46.360
Caption: communal shape and sizes to expand on

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:49.720
Caption: this a little bit I would like to

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.309
Caption: introduce you to some of them first

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.500
Caption: person I&#39;d like to introduce you to is

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:57.279
Caption: alice alice is missing regularly come

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.630
Caption: Monday morning

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.490
Caption: you can almost bet that there will be an

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.120
Caption: email in your inbox from Alice saying

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.700
Caption: hey I won&#39;t be in today and when alice

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:09.190
Caption: is in and you walk past her desk you

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.569
Caption: don&#39;t see a code editor there&#39;s nothing

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.820
Caption: related to work there&#39;s like a browser

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.450
Caption: open with social media or any kind of

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.860
Caption: chat program clearly Alice is not

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:25.019
Caption: working as hard as everyone else in the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:27.190
Caption: office yet when it comes to opinions and

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.020
Caption: Alice has always something to say about

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.250
Caption: what&#39;s going on in the office even

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.300
Caption: though it might not be her

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.679
Caption: responsibility however it comes and it

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.860
Caption: comes to delivering the actual piece of

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:40.509
Caption: work Alice isn&#39;t there imagine this

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.220
Caption: going on for week after week after week

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:49.869
Caption: and nothing changes clearly you might

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.699
Caption: find that Alice&#39;s lack or lack of

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:57.970
Caption: motivation starts to mess with your own

00:03:51.699 --> 00:04:00.599
Caption: motivation the second person is Bob Bob

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.250
Caption: does an amazing job at pointing out and

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.900
Caption: finding the most mind and negative

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.809
Caption: things in someone&#39;s caught on a merge

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:10.209
Caption: request or a pull request even though

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:11.800
Caption: you might you know that this person was

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.330
Caption: putting up the pull request is still

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.570
Caption: learning and bob rarely offers any

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.459
Caption: actual real constructive feedback or

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.619
Caption: pointers towards resources and

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.388
Caption: documentation to learn and

00:04:23.619 --> 00:04:29.410
Caption: improve for that person&#39;s still learning

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.449
Caption: over time some people may actually

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.320
Caption: become scared of putting a pull request

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.600
Caption: because they are afraid of the backlash

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.649
Caption: that could occur like comments raining

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.619
Caption: down on them there was a car hitting

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:43.630
Caption: this wrong with that room when

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:45.070
Caption: discussing work Bob doesn&#39;t like other

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.770
Caption: people&#39;s I&#39;d like to hear other people&#39;s

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.660
Caption: ideas he likes to push his own ideas

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:55.539
Caption: forward if a project doesn&#39;t go the way

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.580
Caption: or in the direction that Bob likes he

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.960
Caption: may actually stop contributing or

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:05.829
Caption: becomes emotional about it and yet you

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:08.709
Caption: noticed that Bob doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t seem to

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:14.319
Caption: treat everyone the same it depends

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:19.329
Caption: whether or not they agree with him last

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:21.940
Caption: but not least Charlie Charlie is a

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:25.089
Caption: manager when you have a meeting with

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.039
Caption: Charlie you share it and want to share

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:29.010
Caption: your ideas with Charlie or how to

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.200
Caption: improve the project are you working off

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:37.960
Caption: you find that charlie is dismissive and

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.729
Caption: doesn&#39;t want to hear you out here are

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:42.429
Caption: these are too hard to implement or just

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.700
Caption: not gonna work key things but a week

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:48.820
Caption: later when you find out that Charlie had

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.970
Caption: a meeting with his bosses and he clearly

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.098
Caption: has sold your ideas as his own suddenly

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.529
Caption: he gets all the praise for the thing

00:05:54.098 --> 00:05:59.139
Caption: that you&#39;ve come up with you put it down

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:01.899
Caption: as a once-off but then you learn over

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.490
Caption: time that it&#39;s actually the fact that

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:05.769
Caption: Charlie has done this time and time

00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:09.940
Caption: again with ideas on people&#39;s ideas in

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:11.529
Caption: the organization now you&#39;re no longer

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.299
Caption: sure if he should be thinking of all

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:16.389
Caption: this stuff to improve the product that

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:17.859
Caption: you&#39;re on I should have spent time think

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:22.179
Caption: of different approaches or how to fix

00:06:17.859 --> 00:06:24.668
Caption: things as you can see a lot of trees

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:27.820
Caption: these traits are quite connected to each

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.919
Caption: other before we move on though I&#39;d like

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.550
Caption: to mention that I purely chose those

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:36.119
Caption: names to for me to remember them and

00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:38.889
Caption: refer back to them later

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:40.899
Caption: it&#39;s hard to distinguish between a toxic

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.540
Caption: developer and someone who simply

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:46.809
Caption: disagrees with you or your team it&#39;s

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:49.360
Caption: important to acknowledge that people can

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:51.339
Caption: have bad days disagreements or simply

00:06:49.359 --> 00:06:54.189
Caption: don&#39;t get well along along with each

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:56.350
Caption: other you peers may suffer from social

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:59.170
Caption: anxiety or our trust not good with

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.490
Caption: social interactions over time you will

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.620
Caption: discover that there&#39;s a certain patent

00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:05.859
Caption: or actually it&#39;s just a once of

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:09.190
Caption: situation so it&#39;s super important to

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:14.559
Caption: remember difficult developers are not

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:16.480
Caption: necessarily toxic developers how are you

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:18.910
Caption: affected by a toxic developer when you

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.480
Caption: self-sacrifice what does that mean you

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.739
Caption: start changing the way you do things you

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.779
Caption: start naming things differently in a

00:07:23.739 --> 00:07:28.149
Caption: code you follow this one person&#39;s advice

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.109
Caption: like you should be doing this way even

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:31.479
Caption: though you have done it the other way

00:07:29.109 --> 00:07:33.429
Caption: for so many times so many years in your

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:37.630
Caption: career and this is the only person has a

00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:40.899
Caption: problem with it up suddenly you try to

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:44.830
Caption: please that one person to avoid conflict

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:47.529
Caption: you and want to maintain peace you start

00:07:44.829 --> 00:07:50.019
Caption: avoiding interaction if possible or you

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:51.130
Caption: resort to flattery where you compliment

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:52.989
Caption: someone a lot of things things with

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:56.320
Caption: input even though it may not actually

00:07:52.989 --> 00:07:58.418
Caption: mean it and it actually goes to the it

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:03.399
Caption: could code towards a negative impact on

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:05.200
Caption: you and your work and to go on and that

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:08.019
Caption: is that you actually start doubting

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.750
Caption: yourself and your abilities like maybe

00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:13.720
Caption: Bob is right maybe I haven&#39;t done enough

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.070
Caption: research maybe he knows better even

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.200
Caption: though I&#39;ve been in this industry for 10

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:21.970
Caption: years I might be wrong or may not just

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:24.070
Caption: not good enough and to continue on with

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.860
Caption: that you may start feeling like quitting

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.729
Caption: like maybe goes on break maybe I&#39;m not

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:29.228
Caption: good enough maybe I should go to a

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:32.049
Caption: different job or find a more suitable

00:08:29.229 --> 00:08:33.190
Caption: job or reverse worry like ah I just

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:33.700
Caption: really don&#39;t want to deal with that

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.489
Caption: person

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:40.989
Caption: I may just create and find a better job

00:08:36.489 --> 00:08:43.109
Caption: I should have nothing to do Peter you

00:08:40.989 --> 00:08:45.909
Caption: mental health starts deteriorating and

00:08:43.109 --> 00:08:47.799
Caption: that manifests itself example in trouble

00:08:45.909 --> 00:08:49.719
Caption: sleeping when you go home after work

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:52.359
Caption: you carry all that stuff and you&#39;re

00:08:49.719 --> 00:08:55.088
Caption: thinking about how what did let&#39;s say

00:08:52.359 --> 00:08:57.278
Caption: this morning or what did Bob say that

00:08:55.088 --> 00:09:00.518
Caption: pull request is today you&#39;re taking it

00:08:57.278 --> 00:09:01.659
Caption: with you to bed and that leads to the

00:09:00.518 --> 00:09:04.028
Caption: next day where you&#39;re lacking

00:09:01.659 --> 00:09:07.268
Caption: concentration you having trouble like

00:09:04.028 --> 00:09:12.729
Caption: thinking about solutions you effectively

00:09:07.268 --> 00:09:14.078
Caption: lose your efficiency and when you think

00:09:12.729 --> 00:09:15.570
Caption: about driving into work in the morning

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.620

00:10:46.619 --> 00:10:51.210

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:53.090

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:58.710

00:10:53.090 --> 00:11:01.140
Caption: they want to please a certain person and

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:04.890
Caption: the other thing is that people come in

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.359
Caption: consistent so a certain person may deal

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.160
Caption: happily with you and it&#39;s friendly

00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:09.599

00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:12.779
Caption: actually treating someone else in the

00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:14.130
Caption: organization differently or that toxic

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:18.120
Caption: developer treats their team different

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:22.130

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:25.559
Caption: people are trusting their behavior now

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:27.840
Caption: if you are in a material lead kind of

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:31.559
Caption: role think about what this does to your

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:36.150
Caption: team and their productivity it&#39;s not

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:45.690
Caption: really good for a workplace is it who

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:48.180
Caption: knows a heavy section if you find that

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.020
Caption: certain traits or behaviors could match

00:11:48.179 --> 00:11:51.750
Caption: with what you&#39;re doing

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.540
Caption: there are some good news though here&#39;s

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:56.390
Caption: how you can deal the toxic developer

00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:58.588
Caption: this third and last section of my talk

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:01.920
Caption: when I prepared it I made it for three

00:11:58.588 --> 00:12:05.820
Caption: kinds of people the perpetrators the

00:12:01.919 --> 00:12:07.320
Caption: victims and their neighbors when I first

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:12.359
Caption: heard about the concept of an enabler I

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:15.330
Caption: was like what no what is an enabler

00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:17.599
Caption: let me explain enable is someone who

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.250
Caption: sees toxic behavior and does nothing a

00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:22.529
Caption: bystander

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:25.109
Caption: it&#39;s a co-worker who chomps on toxic

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:29.580
Caption: behavior and give amplifies the voice

00:12:25.109 --> 00:12:31.979
Caption: and give them a voice even it&#39;s also a

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:34.440
Caption: manager who does nothing when issues are

00:12:31.979 --> 00:12:36.389
Caption: reported to them and that last kind of

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.210
Caption: point is quite important when you

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:41.429
Caption: consider that by doing nothing the

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:46.350
Caption: enabler B could become the perpetrator

00:12:41.429 --> 00:12:48.510
Caption: in the eyes of the victims so my advice

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:51.779
Caption: is focus your energy on what you can

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:55.049
Caption: control build resilience remember your

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:57.420
Caption: priorities and don&#39;t sell sacrifice

00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:58.709
Caption: the things you&#39;re doing stop it doesn&#39;t

00:12:57.419 --> 00:12:59.760
Caption: help anyone doesn&#39;t help your team

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.770
Caption: doesn&#39;t help you doesn&#39;t help your

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.619
Caption: organization don&#39;t change the way you do

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:08.989
Caption: things because of one person&#39;s opinion

00:13:03.619 --> 00:13:11.369
Caption: and think about the way you react to

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:12.929
Caption: comments or toxic comments like poor

00:13:11.369 --> 00:13:13.799
Caption: requests comments like ah you&#39;re doing

00:13:12.929 --> 00:13:19.469
Caption: this wrong that&#39;s wrong

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:22.200
Caption: you&#39;re wrong don&#39;t be reactive and it&#39;s

00:13:19.469 --> 00:13:25.739
Caption: easy for our responses to become too

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:27.720
Caption: emotional rather than illogical so

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:30.119
Caption: choose your battles wisely and stand

00:13:27.719 --> 00:13:32.759
Caption: your ground when the time is right or in

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:37.260
Caption: other words know when to let something

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:40.650
Caption: go and when to make a point or push your

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:43.020
Caption: points rather if you see toxic behavior

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:45.480
Caption: going on challenge that behavior ask

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.040
Caption: questions like how would you fix

00:13:45.479 --> 00:13:48.959
Caption: something you can&#39;t just say it&#39;s broken

00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:51.750
Caption: and everything is bad how do you fix it

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.500
Caption: how do you improve something ask

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:57.500
Caption: questions

00:13:52.500 --> 00:14:00.270
Caption: don&#39;t just let them do what I do and

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.520
Caption: don&#39;t become the enabler that&#39;s also

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:05.309
Caption: very important in challenging that so

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.960
Caption: don&#39;t amplifier my voice and if you have

00:14:05.309 --> 00:14:09.299
Caption: done your research and you have put a

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.890
Caption: piece of work up and logic question or

00:14:09.299 --> 00:14:12.359
Caption: poor guessing people are reviewing it

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.980
Caption: you&#39;ve done your research you&#39;ve looked

00:14:12.359 --> 00:14:16.109
Caption: at the documentation you read the

00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:17.669
Caption: manuals whatever tool you&#39;re using you

00:14:16.109 --> 00:14:19.589
Caption: kind of feel like this is the best I

00:14:17.669 --> 00:14:20.849
Caption: could do this is the pattern that a lot

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.100
Caption: of people are using and you still get

00:14:20.849 --> 00:14:24.989
