Caption: to be members almost everybody wants one

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:09.268
Caption: but nobody knows how to actually get one

00:15:06.528 --> 00:15:11.549
Caption: so what I&#39;m going to tell you how today

00:15:09.268 --> 00:15:12.928
Caption: my older remainder of this talk is

00:15:11.549 --> 00:15:15.598
Caption: futile leave with some concrete

00:15:12.929 --> 00:15:18.088
Caption: vegetable steps to get yourself involved

00:15:15.598 --> 00:15:19.588
Caption: with mentoring and the certainly minty

00:15:18.088 --> 00:15:22.429
Caption: sighs it seems like there were more

00:15:19.588 --> 00:15:26.158
Caption: people who work or looking for a mentor

00:15:22.429 --> 00:15:28.199
Caption: now like many of you this is the image I

00:15:26.158 --> 00:15:29.758
Caption: have adventuring up till few years ago

00:15:28.198 --> 00:15:31.528
Caption: you know this wise sage on the

00:15:29.758 --> 00:15:32.938
Caption: mountaintop that we&#39;ve dispensed mister

00:15:31.528 --> 00:15:34.888
Caption: will tell you what to do in your career

00:15:32.939 --> 00:15:37.889
Caption: and of course everybody wants out like

00:15:34.888 --> 00:15:39.568
Caption: who put them in that&#39;s the minute that I

00:15:37.888 --> 00:15:41.278
Caption: want to discuss because managers come in

00:15:39.568 --> 00:15:43.378
Caption: a lot of different shapes and sizes and

00:15:41.278 --> 00:15:45.809
Caption: you probably have several right now in

00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:47.519
Caption: your life who don&#39;t even realize it so

00:15:45.809 --> 00:15:49.169
Caption: this is why I came from aluminum code

00:15:47.518 --> 00:15:50.549
Caption: Singapore meetup I went to earlier this

00:15:49.169 --> 00:15:52.768
Caption: year we were having a discussion about

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:54.179
Caption: ventures and how to find them we started

00:15:52.768 --> 00:15:56.158
Caption: by the visiting everything you could

00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:57.658
Caption: think of that mentors did and sort of

00:15:56.158 --> 00:15:59.939
Caption: categorizing would you put a lot of

00:15:57.658 --> 00:16:01.739
Caption: different things so sometimes those are

00:15:59.939 --> 00:16:03.269
Caption: just there to inspire review you know

00:16:01.739 --> 00:16:05.039
Caption: look like a role model it might be

00:16:03.268 --> 00:16:06.359
Caption: someone like boy though we&#39;ve seen an

00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:08.578
Caption: event that is written that booked in

00:16:06.359 --> 00:16:10.750
Caption: love and they just provided a vision for

00:16:08.578 --> 00:16:13.659
Caption: your career that you want it anyway

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:15.250
Caption: you know them there are ministers give

00:16:13.659 --> 00:16:16.629
Caption: you career values and that&#39;s probably

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.890
Caption: the closest to that stage on the

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.690
Caption: mountains how I&#39;m dealing you know

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:22.299
Caption: that&#39;s someone in the industry who&#39;s bad

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:23.380
Caption: manner you know they can probably see

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:25.450
Caption: the big picture

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.130
Caption: hope you make actionable steps to get

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.250
Caption: where you want to go in your career and

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.390
Caption: provide accountability on getting there

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:33.429
Caption: they&#39;re also members who help you with

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.989
Caption: the day-to-day aspects of your job

00:16:33.429 --> 00:16:36.309
Caption: we called them tech mentors here but I

00:16:34.989 --> 00:16:38.109
Caption: think a better name is probably the

00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:39.969
Caption: coaches you know it doesn&#39;t necessarily

00:16:38.109 --> 00:16:41.950
Caption: have to be tapped this could be someone

00:16:39.969 --> 00:16:43.839
Caption: that you pair programmer it could be you

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.880
Caption: know a senior developer in your company

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.590
Caption: maybe an old colleague in the industry

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.510
Caption: you catch up with them out then if you

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.700
Caption: share you know advice and ask questions

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:54.010
Caption: you even even give slack community and I

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:57.190
Caption: think that&#39;s not the cut community here

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:58.570
Caption: in Perth is a great example of this some

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.380
Caption: ministers go above and beyond just

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.270
Caption: giving you advice

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.890
Caption: they actually advocate on your behalf

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:05.229
Caption: and we&#39;ve called the champions

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.510
Caption: I&#39;m also heard the term sponsors and

00:17:05.229 --> 00:17:10.299
Caption: these are fantastic is this someone who

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:12.489
Caption: not just will give you some tips but

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.350
Caption: will actively suggest you for roles and

00:17:12.489 --> 00:17:17.050
Caption: give you referrals interacts with it

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:19.270
Caption: right and lastly there are your peers

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.010
Caption: and people always discount peers and you

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.630
Caption: know you shouldn&#39;t like your friends

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:25.150
Caption: your colleagues and people on your team

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:27.609
Caption: the people around you at this event are

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:29.140
Caption: your peers they share your frustrations

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:30.179
Caption: and you can talk to them and get advice

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.859
Caption: and ideas

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.300
Caption: now the cool thing is there is no limits

00:17:32.859 --> 00:17:35.650
Caption: how many measures you can have and you

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.119
Caption: can have members from all these

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.580
Caption: different nerves you probably have some

00:17:37.119 --> 00:17:43.059
Caption: now and sometimes even a single person

00:17:39.579 --> 00:17:45.010
Caption: can fulfill multiple walls here it&#39;s

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.480

Caption: community if your company has a

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.530
Caption: mentoring program take advantage of it

00:18:07.939 --> 00:18:11.659
Caption: like what does most people think once

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:13.820
Caption: you do a but you should you know I tell

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.260

Caption: there&#39;s a group ladies called Metro box

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.820

Caption: eventually them to or because you can

Caption: just ask somebody and that is the

00:19:03.439 --> 00:19:06.909
Caption: hardest one by far so I&#39;m gonna tell you

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.410
Caption: the story of how about I got my mentor

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:11.349
Caption: so my mentor is someone that I saw speak

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.640
Caption: at a tech event about five years ago and

00:19:11.349 --> 00:19:15.500
Caption: they just went straight into met like a

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.920
Caption: inspiring bucket I was just like oh my

Caption: clearly really smart very confident knew

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.089
Caption: what she was doing seemed like someone

00:19:25.058 --> 00:19:30.760
Caption: who we have all the answers and I just

00:19:27.089 --> 00:19:32.739
Caption: so the girl so it kind of just stopped I

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.750
Caption: couldn&#39;t even get an occurrence to like

00:19:32.739 --> 00:19:36.099
Caption: talk to her you know a few years later I

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:43.540
Caption: connected whether or not LinkedIn and

00:19:36.099 --> 00:19:45.099
Caption: she just might look by this point she

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.500
Caption: was a c-level that like that being

00:19:45.099 --> 00:19:49.660

Caption: got time to be on with me unless the

00:19:51.099 --> 00:19:55.329
Caption: Waikiki problems and then the 918 once

00:19:53.979 --> 00:19:56.349
Caption: ago I was finding a friend of mine and I

00:19:55.329 --> 00:19:58.239
Caption: was telling her how their career

00:19:56.349 --> 00:20:00.789
Caption: crossroads kind of did you know Ericsson

00:19:58.239 --> 00:20:02.439
Caption: is you could really use a network and

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.600
Caption: she doesn&#39;t know you should talk to you

00:20:02.439 --> 00:20:07.058
Caption: should totally talk to this person like

00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:09.339
Caption: I all right I&#39;m gonna stop in her for

00:20:07.058 --> 00:20:11.619
Caption: years but I like what she&#39;s up to

00:20:09.339 --> 00:20:14.798
Caption: II like you know and she&#39;s like any

00:20:11.619 --> 00:20:15.520
Caption: early yet and because I&#39;m gonna give you

00:20:14.798 --> 00:20:19.149
Caption: some advice

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:21.700
Caption: and she can mean the best tip it is that

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:24.369
Caption: one rear tip for getting a mentor and I

00:20:21.699 --> 00:20:26.079
Caption: know that Cheryl there is what you&#39;re

00:20:24.369 --> 00:20:27.219
Caption: talkin to do if you me you have some

00:20:26.079 --> 00:20:28.989
Caption: relationship with a person you&#39;re a

00:20:27.219 --> 00:20:31.630
Caption: complete stranger that we use you

00:20:28.989 --> 00:20:34.298
Caption: separating them you say hi Ohio

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:36.190
Caption: under this sort of pure crossroads I&#39;m

00:20:34.298 --> 00:20:38.439
Caption: looking permanent or right now ideally

00:20:36.189 --> 00:20:41.859
Caption: my mentor would have all of these

00:20:38.439 --> 00:20:46.149
Caption: categories of course you would be ideal

00:20:41.859 --> 00:20:48.400
Caption: but I know that you Julie are so busy in

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:50.049
Caption: your schedule so I really want to know

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.849
Caption: if you have five minutes of your time

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:54.149
Caption: where we can get our coffee and you

00:20:51.849 --> 00:20:58.959
Caption: could suggest some potential

00:20:54.150 --> 00:21:01.030
Caption: and I was like that is genius because it

00:20:58.959 --> 00:21:03.010
Caption: gives them an out you know gives them an

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.930
Caption: outlet to say and that&#39;s why I felt

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.849
Caption: embarrassed at making her reject me and

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.860
Caption: that got to get away you know so the

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:10.419
Caption: standards like worst-case scenario now

00:21:08.859 --> 00:21:12.069
Caption: she has to give me some names of

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:15.040
Caption: potential mentors like that&#39;s not too

00:21:12.069 --> 00:21:16.659
Caption: bad best-case scenario what happened in

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.150
Caption: my case and what I imagine happens in

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:21.160
Caption: most cases is unique with a person and

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.950
Caption: then they end up becoming your mentor so

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.810
Caption: there you go that is my top tip break my

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:27.909
Caption: only regret is that we didn&#39;t accept her

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.080
Caption: earlier because she fiction she&#39;s gonna

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.450
Caption: go through the cabinets that she was

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:33.339
Caption: inspiration now she&#39;s been her mentor

00:21:31.449 --> 00:21:35.199
Caption: and actually now that we put things up

00:21:33.339 --> 00:21:36.429
Caption: book a year she&#39;s moved into the sponsor

00:21:35.199 --> 00:21:37.779
Caption: stage like she&#39;s actually gonna

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:40.869
Caption: referring me and her stuff which is

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:43.210
Caption: fantastic and when I told her how I felt

00:21:40.869 --> 00:21:44.050
Caption: like you know too embarrassed to ask her

00:21:43.209 --> 00:21:47.079
Caption: for you she was if you&#39;re an idiot

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:48.360
Caption: usually a few years ago that&#39;s why I

00:21:47.079 --> 00:21:50.799
Caption: stopped by

00:21:48.359 --> 00:21:52.599

00:22:47.469 --> 00:22:52.780

00:23:07.869 --> 00:23:11.410

00:23:09.729 --> 00:23:13.449
Caption: they&#39;re not committing or to something

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:16.090
Caption: entirely open-ended and then you can

00:23:13.449 --> 00:23:17.709
Caption: sort of review it that&#39;s when you should

00:23:16.089 --> 00:23:19.750
Caption: be able to respectful of their time you

00:23:17.709 --> 00:23:21.789
Caption: know don&#39;t be late I&#39;ll cancel on the

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:24.548
Caption: last minute don&#39;t badger them of

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:26.410
Caption: questions in between sessions I mean

00:23:24.548 --> 00:23:28.539
Caption: give you some advice you should follow

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:30.549
Caption: it but when she tells me to do something

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.049
Caption: I&#39;m infant no and then usually the next

00:23:30.548 --> 00:23:33.699
Caption: time we meet up I&#39;d tell her about how

00:23:32.048 --> 00:23:34.808
Caption: they did with that like that&#39;s just nice

00:23:33.699 --> 00:23:36.969
Caption: and respectful that&#39;s what they&#39;re there

00:23:34.808 --> 00:23:38.649
Caption: for and if they do refer you for

00:23:36.969 --> 00:23:40.270
Caption: something realize how great that is

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.890
Caption: they&#39;re putting their reputation on the

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.799
Caption: line for you so you should do everything

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:46.299
Caption: you can to make them look good the end

00:23:44.798 --> 00:23:48.308
Caption: of the openness feedback and really let

00:23:46.298 --> 00:23:49.959
Caption: go of your ego and this again part that

00:23:48.308 --> 00:23:52.539
Caption: I was talking some of the mentors a lot

00:23:49.959 --> 00:23:53.859
Caption: of like entrepreneurs it&#39;s just painful

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.049
Caption: they come in and they give you their

00:23:53.859 --> 00:23:58.569
Caption: business idea and you poke holes in it

00:23:56.048 --> 00:24:00.639
Caption: and it&#39;s just crushing but a minister is

00:23:58.569 --> 00:24:01.689
Caption: not about just giving you validation you

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.549
Caption: know that&#39;s what they&#39;re there for

00:24:01.689 --> 00:24:05.259
Caption: they&#39;re there to actually tell you about

00:24:03.548 --> 00:24:07.839
Caption: the whole places this could go wrong so

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:11.589
Caption: you know try to not get too invested in

00:24:07.839 --> 00:24:12.939
Caption: them and learn sleep study Genda like

00:24:11.589 --> 00:24:14.678
Caption: and once you are in sort of like a big

00:24:12.939 --> 00:24:16.500
Caption: corporate program you probably not going

00:24:14.678 --> 00:24:19.178
Caption: to have a structured format for these

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.558
Caption: exceptions you know and it&#39;s retention

00:24:19.178 --> 00:24:22.000
Caption: you hold in that trap again I&#39;m just

00:24:20.558 --> 00:24:23.979
Caption: speaking them they&#39;re don&#39;t my stage

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.260
Caption: when we was coming how this mentoring

00:24:23.979 --> 00:24:27.849
Caption: thing is supposed to work instead you

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.869
Caption: have to do it you have to get the most

00:24:27.849 --> 00:24:31.630
Caption: out of the relationship

00:24:28.869 --> 00:24:33.459
Caption: and since aren&#39;t sure there are plenty

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.839
Caption: of introverts here who are just cringing

00:24:33.459 --> 00:24:36.028
Caption: at the thought of this conversation I&#39;ll

00:24:34.839 --> 00:24:37.288
Caption: give you some ideas

00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:40.348
Caption: is that you can talk about what

00:24:37.288 --> 00:24:41.998
Caption: everybody just some different work done

00:24:40.348 --> 00:24:44.009

00:24:41.999 --> 00:24:45.479
Caption: asking about it career path ask some

00:24:45.479 --> 00:24:49.859

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.590

00:26:08.209 --> 00:26:15.739
Caption: flip side actually being mentally came

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.940
Caption: to being a mentor by accident and I was

00:26:15.739 --> 00:26:19.429
Caption: reading for like a really long time

00:26:16.939 --> 00:26:20.839
Caption: before I realized that I was most of my

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.250
Caption: mentoring came about through my

00:26:20.839 --> 00:26:24.589
Caption: involvement with the city Girl Meets

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:26.719

Caption: to pitched your have to know how to do

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:41.869
Caption: the presentation part and that&#39;s common

00:26:39.819 --> 00:26:43.609
Caption: responses will look like this popping up

00:26:41.869 --> 00:26:46.040
Caption: so is necessarily anything but common

00:26:43.609 --> 00:26:49.459
Caption: sense I don&#39;t consider myself an expert

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:51.619
Caption: on that topic okay so it makes it softer

00:26:49.459 --> 00:26:53.479

Caption: you sir so what I&#39;m saying is there are

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.489
Caption: a lot of different ways to be a mentor

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:33.619

Caption: people when you just don&#39;t call it that

00:27:37.928 --> 00:27:42.048
Caption: so you want to start down the mentoring

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:44.750
Caption: path i recommend you start small and

00:27:42.048 --> 00:27:46.369
Caption: more populated so just generally be

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.530

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.058
Caption: newbies that they can come to you and

00:27:54.319 --> 00:27:59.269

Caption: friends find the person off on their own

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.619
Caption: and talk to them if you can&#39;t go to

00:28:05.178 --> 00:28:08.269
Caption: meetups consider joining the slack

00:28:06.619 --> 00:28:09.739

00:28:26.798 --> 00:28:30.709
Caption: and there&#39;s group mentoring which you

00:28:29.119 --> 00:28:32.750
Caption: know the easiest step is probably giving

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:35.359
Caption: talks significant in any purse next year

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:37.969

00:30:03.629 --> 00:30:10.109
Caption: work but no but there&#39;s actually get a

00:30:07.319 --> 00:30:11.849
Caption: lot out of it you know first implements

00:30:10.109 --> 00:30:13.918
Caption: unique confidence something what is it

00:30:11.849 --> 00:30:16.678
Caption: like 70% of us have an imposter syndrome

00:30:13.918 --> 00:30:17.908

00:30:16.678 --> 00:30:20.189

Caption: business deal but my talents

00:30:20.189 --> 00:30:23.339
Caption: but helping another teaching you know

00:30:21.839 --> 00:30:27.058
Caption: things you get more confident in your

00:30:23.339 --> 00:30:28.319
Caption: own abilities it&#39;s just amazing you do

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:30.119
Caption: perspective on your own problems

00:30:28.319 --> 00:30:31.589
Caption: everyone has this tendency to think that

00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:33.509
Caption: whatever you&#39;re going through is these

00:30:31.589 --> 00:30:35.099
Caption: unique you know your company and it&#39;s

00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:36.690
Caption: not the more you talk to other people

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:37.528
Caption: other companies more you realize that

00:30:36.689 --> 00:30:39.798
Caption: it&#39;s not going to do everything

00:30:37.529 --> 00:30:42.600
Caption: everybody else opposed to the same stuff

00:30:39.798 --> 00:30:44.339
Caption: you get better communication skills you

00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:46.259
Caption: know when you&#39;re you&#39;re teaching someone

00:30:44.339 --> 00:30:47.969
Caption: who&#39;s just starting out but we get good

00:30:46.259 --> 00:30:50.190
Caption: at explaining your ideas in different

00:30:47.969 --> 00:30:54.329
Caption: ways you have to learn how to have your

00:30:50.189 --> 00:30:56.459
Caption: ideas received and understood by the 19

00:30:54.329 --> 00:30:58.018
Caption: and that can lead to developing

00:30:56.459 --> 00:30:59.788
Caption: leadership skills you know I think a lot

00:30:58.019 --> 00:31:01.769
Caption: of tech people are interested in maybe

00:30:59.788 --> 00:31:03.209
Caption: looking into a leadership role and

00:31:01.769 --> 00:31:04.649
Caption: leadership isn&#39;t so much about what you

00:31:03.209 --> 00:31:07.648
Caption: do it&#39;s about influencing other people

00:31:04.649 --> 00:31:09.149
Caption: that communication so mentoring can be a

00:31:07.649 --> 00:31:11.690
Caption: really good stepping stone they give you

00:31:09.149 --> 00:31:14.250
Caption: an idea of what that actually feels like

00:31:11.689 --> 00:31:16.199
Caption: mentoring can give you you know you can

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:18.178
Caption: learn stuff you can give you exposure to

00:31:16.199 --> 00:31:20.178
Caption: technology to trends and things that you

00:31:18.178 --> 00:31:22.528
Caption: don&#39;t actually use in your day job

00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:23.908
Caption: you don&#39;t want you to pay back that&#39;s

00:31:22.529 --> 00:31:25.590
Caption: one for me you know I have a lot of

00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:27.360
Caption: people help me out with my career when I

00:31:25.589 --> 00:31:28.888
Caption: started and it feels really nice to

00:31:27.359 --> 00:31:32.009
Caption: actually take that back and pass it

00:31:28.889 --> 00:31:33.600
Caption: along and lastly just I think it&#39;s human

00:31:32.009 --> 00:31:35.099
Caption: beings connecting with other people and

00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:36.839
Caption: helping them feels really nice if you

00:31:35.099 --> 00:31:38.459
Caption: get a massive buzz when you see someone

00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:41.638
Caption: do something that they didn&#39;t think of

00:31:38.459 --> 00:31:43.768
Caption: ever do so mentoring isn&#39;t just

00:31:41.639 --> 00:31:45.330
Caption: outsourcing or charity is a two-way

00:31:43.769 --> 00:31:48.520
Caption: street you get so much out of it as you

00:31:45.329 --> 00:31:51.010
Caption: put into it plus the satisfaction as

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:53.020
Caption: of the camps I&#39;ve ruled mentoring will

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:55.449
Caption: be an immediate tangible opportunity to

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.580
Caption: making industry better and I don&#39;t think

00:31:55.449 --> 00:31:59.169
Caption: earlier to realize the difference you

00:31:57.579 --> 00:32:00.849
Caption: can have the impact you can make right

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:03.910
Caption: now no matter how following your career

00:32:00.849 --> 00:32:06.369
Caption: you are and I&#39;m just good we&#39;re getting

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:08.320
Caption: entered my travel today I&#39;m gonna give

00:32:06.369 --> 00:32:11.140
Caption: you an example of my own experience as a

00:32:08.319 --> 00:32:11.949
Caption: mentor to show you exactly what clubs

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:13.750
Caption: across your name

00:32:11.949 --> 00:32:16.178
Caption: so earlier this year I was giving a talk

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:18.040
Caption: at coder Academy and sinning and so this

00:32:16.178 --> 00:32:20.140
Caption: is a six-month certainty of course these

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.660
Caption: people have given up six months their

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:25.089
Caption: lives a lot of money because they want

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:27.250
Caption: so badly to be in this industry and so I

00:32:25.089 --> 00:32:29.829
Caption: need to talk to them in Q&amp;A the end and

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:35.199
Caption: this one guy versus Hannity I was at and

00:32:29.829 --> 00:32:37.959
Caption: he said how intense is it in using me

00:32:35.199 --> 00:32:39.909
Caption: how is it like you know the job like

00:32:37.959 --> 00:32:41.678
Caption: yeah it&#39;s more intense sometimes another

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:43.750
Caption: so if you&#39;ve been in this intense thing

00:32:41.678 --> 00:32:46.808
Caption: but the Whoopi&#39;s is intensive courses

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:49.989
Caption: then he was like you need we don&#39;t have

00:32:46.808 --> 00:32:54.069
Caption: to code 24/7 and have a side hustle and

00:32:49.989 --> 00:32:54.849
Caption: stay up tonight where the world is you

00:32:54.069 --> 00:32:58.899
Caption: get that idea

00:32:54.849 --> 00:33:02.890
Caption: he says the mentoring about me I was

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:04.750
Caption: arrested my these people wanted so badly

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:07.239
Caption: to be what developers and they were

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:08.558
Caption: already scared and freaked out about the

00:33:07.239 --> 00:33:11.599
Caption: stress and demands they can even have

00:33:08.558 --> 00:33:13.548
Caption: our jobs here and another mentor

00:33:11.599 --> 00:33:15.918
Caption: old that someone had sold them on the

00:33:13.548 --> 00:33:19.428
Caption: men that overworking is the only way to

00:33:15.918 --> 00:33:21.619
Caption: succeed now we all did that very very

00:33:19.428 --> 00:33:23.689
Caption: you know I did that I work 12-hour days

00:33:21.619 --> 00:33:26.359
Caption: I sent emails way too late at night I

00:33:23.689 --> 00:33:29.239
Caption: don&#39;t know anymore collectively moving

00:33:26.359 --> 00:33:32.209
Caption: past them um but I guess it&#39;s not the

00:33:29.239 --> 00:33:34.280
Caption: case just just two days ago my friend

00:33:32.209 --> 00:33:37.339
Caption: Mike Sharpe at CityU tweeted a link to

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:41.989
Caption: this job Adam this is a real job that

00:33:37.339 --> 00:33:45.229
Caption: read the bold a bit 17 to 19 pounds of

00:33:41.989 --> 00:33:47.329
Caption: eight and then you&#39;re proud this team is

00:33:45.229 --> 00:33:50.449
Caption: proud about driving people to earn it

00:33:47.329 --> 00:33:53.140
Caption: it&#39;s part of their culture of it you

00:33:50.449 --> 00:33:55.369
Caption: know so this myth is not dead just

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.469
Caption: getting air in front of that group of

00:33:55.369 --> 00:34:00.380
Caption: junior developers I think the only thing

00:33:57.469 --> 00:34:04.219
Caption: I could think of a response I told them

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:06.798
Caption: that measure was full of I told

00:34:04.219 --> 00:34:08.178
Caption: them that it was a solidary I told them

00:34:06.798 --> 00:34:10.070
Caption: that was wrong and they should not

00:34:08.178 --> 00:34:13.339
Caption: accept any roles and any companies that

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:15.109
Caption: we expect that you know and obviously if

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.330
Caption: I say to any one of them from taking a

00:34:15.108 --> 00:34:19.759
Caption: job like this I that makes me very hard

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:21.409
Caption: and that right there is one of the ways

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.898
Caption: that I think you can have a major impact

00:34:21.408 --> 00:34:26.719
Caption: as a mentor by calling out those

00:34:23.898 --> 00:34:27.559
Caption: damaging myths and behaviors that we

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:30.428
Caption: mentor them

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:33.619
Caption: we know her industry energy will work in

00:34:30.428 --> 00:34:35.060
Caption: so there&#39;s motive myths just briefly the

00:34:33.618 --> 00:34:36.769
Caption: one thing you have to be a full-stack

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:39.320
Caption: developer and you have to know

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:42.229
Caption: everything you know Joel Khalifa coined

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:44.540
Caption: the term full-stack anxiety which is the

00:34:42.229 --> 00:34:46.250
Caption: stress brought on by companies and

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:52.229
Caption: recruiters who expect to my review

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:55.379
Caption: course you can do everything it&#39;s okay

00:34:52.229 --> 00:34:57.209
Caption: I recommend he wears many men devote a

00:34:55.379 --> 00:34:59.699
Caption: medium post the other technicians found

00:34:57.209 --> 00:35:02.310

Caption: the people who own the grave html/css

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:06.209
Caption: RG value in the industry in favor of

Caption: people who likes outskirts it&#39;s really

00:35:06.209 --> 00:35:10.589
Caption: good if you don&#39;t read it but it&#39;s

00:35:07.709 --> 00:35:12.510
Caption: perfectly fine to specialize and that

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:15.360
Caption: they take to the next one the content

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:18.000

Caption: term and Linux comps back in January it

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.629

00:36:55.189 --> 00:36:59.959

00:36:59.959 --> 00:37:04.729

Caption: those nineties you hear developers they

00:37:52.669 --> 00:37:57.609
Caption: will go through all this the same reason

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:59.870

Caption: can suck that it can wear it down that

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.440
Caption: it can burn you out and then there are

00:38:43.879 --> 00:38:47.750
Caption: different strategies everybody can use

00:38:45.439 --> 00:38:49.328
Caption: to deal with that you took the

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:51.189
Caption: particular benefits of men

00:38:49.329 --> 00:38:53.380
