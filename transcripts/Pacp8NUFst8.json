  "description": "DevOps and Jira backlogs mostly fail at providing developers, designers and product owners with a holistic view of how user stories relate to each other, in context of a broader project or product roadmap.\\n\\nEnter... feature trees!\\n\\nFeature trees are used as a companion artefact to the product backlog that visualises the relationship between between epics, features and stories in a simple way and shows what has been delivered, what\u0027s being worked on and what is coming up next.\\n\\nA well organised feature tree also acts as a versatile and strategic communication tool. You can use it to find gaps in your backlog, organise your backlog in a clearer way, onboard new developers, and highlight the features and stories of an MVP or upcoming release. They can even be used in a funding request or proposal to communicate your product vision.\\n\\nIn this talk I want to share with you how to create a simple product feature tree and why it should be used in every delivery project.\\n\\nMostly intermediate\\n45 mins\\nLeadership/Management\\nCornel is a Service and Experience Designer that loves creating clarity through research and experimenting to bring products to life."
