Caption: and then got voted in and then they got

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.779
Caption: voted in here so everybody hates me and

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.360
Caption: wants me to make a fool of myself in

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:39.409
Caption: public so my records I think is done to

Caption: the events can&#39;t happen without them

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.280
Caption: because you know they&#39;re not cheeks put

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.840
Caption: on and without answers to put up the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:59.719
Caption: money and you will be paying a lot more

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.488
Caption: or be doing something terrible intent on

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.819

Caption: friends of Western Australia so um I

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.760
Caption: recently moved to Melbourne even much

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:18.919
Caption: nicer [ __ ] he doesn&#39;t die 6:00 p.m. I

Caption: strongly recommend you won&#39;t move there

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:24.860
Caption: I was asked by my tech ladybug head

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:28.489
Caption: remove this port point to the Milton

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.770
Caption: version found not been expecting

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:33.439
Caption: developers insulate no it needs which

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:36.649
Caption: might be officially old and it also need

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.200
Caption: is the internship says that what matters

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.970
Caption: okay so I&#39;ve mostly worked online a

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:42.978
Caption: different systems so take everything

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.830
Caption: that I say in the context of my

00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:47.609
Caption: experiences and these days I mostly work

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.980
Caption: on back inside

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.139
Caption: so the last time I did any series in my

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.490
Caption: HTML it was still okay to lay everything

00:01:52.139 --> 00:02:00.540
Caption: out using tables I did those days those

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:04.979
Caption: days were I am NOT doing CSS

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.590
Caption: I&#39;m just not and I&#39;ve been on projects

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.619
Caption: that went very well I&#39;ve been on pretty

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:14.779
Caption: badly fortunately I&#39;ve never done

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.779
Caption: anything really about it did you think

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.380
Caption: so why am I doing this talk so either

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:25.169
Caption: print suggests that I was running myself

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.840
Caption: down by submitting the topic but I don&#39;t

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:29.819
Caption: actually agree I think it&#39;s an in-stream

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:32.099
Caption: focus way too much on the view journey

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.900
Caption: and negative comments are reserved for

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.639
Caption: people who are doing other stuff that we

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:38.429
Caption: don&#39;t personally like because it&#39;s not

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.350
Caption: our style I think that ignore some

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:42.839
Caption: fundamental truths I think that

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.639
Caption: everybody makes mistakes and failure is

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:47.099
Caption: one of the best ways to learn things so

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:50.550
Caption: I want to encourage people to be

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.450
Caption: appropriately self-critical and I&#39;m kind

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:58.820
Caption: of leading by example so this talk is

00:02:54.449 --> 00:03:00.839
Caption: actually all about me me my ego please

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.420
Caption: everything in is talking on the same I

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:09.059
Caption: mean is criticizing other people is

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:11.039
Caption: beauty looks fun but most people I could

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:15.958
Caption: criticize aren&#39;t here there are a few of

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:19.409
Caption: them hi guys I&#39;m reach for instant and

00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:21.208
Caption: get me at the pub later but you know

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.139
Caption: criticizing poppin could get me attacked

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:27.149
Caption: by lawyers more so more seriously if you

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.289
Caption: can&#39;t admit are the areas where you need

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:32.369
Caption: to improve you&#39;re not going to be able

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:35.360
Caption: to do so so every talk at the contents

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:37.979
Caption: next buzz words these are my buzz words

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.779
Caption: I&#39;ve not met my husband corner and

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:41.639
Caption: you&#39;re not getting saying it buzz words

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:47.408
Caption: again

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:50.378
Caption: so I&#39;m on Durant so back when I first

00:03:47.408 --> 00:03:53.468
Caption: started before MBC before webforms

00:03:50.378 --> 00:03:56.679
Caption: for.net itself my club West Berlin

00:03:53.468 --> 00:03:58.438
Caption: platform was called classic ASP now we

00:03:56.679 --> 00:04:00.938
Caption: didn&#39;t call the classic ASP at the time

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:03.069
Caption: most like World War one walking called

00:04:00.938 --> 00:04:08.048
Caption: World War one at the time and much as a

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.488
Caption: reason so pretty much everything you bad

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:12.908
Caption: you&#39;ve ever heard about that decay is

00:04:09.488 --> 00:04:16.329
Caption: team&#39;s true in the lives actually the

00:04:12.908 --> 00:04:18.429
Caption: lines and at the time I was a very

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.809
Caption: junior developer with excessive

00:04:18.429 --> 00:04:26.859
Caption: confidence and it had a consumer vision

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:29.859
Caption: and a static ASP cause and it really was

00:04:26.859 --> 00:04:32.859
Caption: and never underestimate the ability of a

00:04:29.859 --> 00:04:36.399
Caption: junior developer make things worse and I

00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:37.119
Caption: did so I was looking for ways books has

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:39.039
Caption: been better

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:42.309
Caption: and I thought what I thought was the

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.959
Caption: answer in a Microsoft example project is

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:46.089
Caption: all fooling skipper

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:48.759
Caption: laughs from the audience so the others

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:50.500
Caption: make the suicide and involve building

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.570
Caption: business systems I&#39;m using a business

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.260
Caption: plan and a data layer component in

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.669
Caption: everybody&#39;s favorite language DBT such

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.800
Caption: basic premise when you have a type like

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.380
Caption: a pea coat with all of the basics

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:04.239
Caption: component business a component and how

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.720
Caption: to do all that data access through a

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:09.729
Caption: baby chicks data access component and it

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.848
Caption: taken Microsoft certain must be good

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:16.779
Caption: architecture so I then proceeded to

00:05:12.848 --> 00:05:20.139
Caption: apply this to everything so it&#39;ll kind

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:21.880
Caption: of like this so you had your cutting

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.429
Caption: edge be website running up really old

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.348
Caption: version is and it had the BB six

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:29.079
Caption: business layer and the data access layer

00:05:26.348 --> 00:05:31.059
Caption: and then finally got the darkest fears

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:32.589
Caption: now clearly this is better than just

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:35.440
Caption: having cutting-edge because it&#39;s got

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:37.658
Caption: layers and now mean everybody muscle a

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.130
Caption: is now I don&#39;t want to sound like let me

00:05:37.658 --> 00:05:41.979
Caption: get separation of concerns because

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.929
Caption: that&#39;s very important we&#39;re putting

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:48.789
Caption: business logic into zb6

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:50.259
Caption: like this is hard limit X doesn&#39;t make

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.479
Caption: it easy to pass on complex data

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.770
Caption: structures and it makes the dev cycle a

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.679
Caption: lot longer

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:59.709
Caption: so practice business play in almost all

00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:01.750
Caption: cases create an instance of the data

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:03.309
Caption: active component and then for the

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:09.639
Caption: whatever call have got straight on to

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:11.049
Caption: the database that added no value of the

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:12.279
Caption: number that says component does a query

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:13.659
Caption: against a database and because the

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:16.630
Caption: record set that gives all the way back

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:19.089
Caption: again and just to have a separation of

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.669
Caption: the query from the business logic but

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:27.250
Caption: cleaning the bbc&#39;s component in nearly

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:29.800
Caption: water is as over at my commencement so

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.509
Caption: pleasant listening white code because

00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:32.228
Caption: it&#39;s actually adding value to your

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.720
Caption: project

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.669
Caption: gravity is demanding in writing

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.979
Caption: significant amount of code that adds no

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:43.389
Caption: value then your architecture gives the

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:44.769
Caption: segment the value of an architecture is

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:48.699
Caption: not determined by where it comes from

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:51.069
Caption: and the promoters the field Authority is

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:55.779
Caption: like a logical fallacy and an extremely

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:58.539
Caption: common reason for doing architecture all

00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:00.820
Caption: female our visits are bringing says that

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:03.218
Caption: and quite often they do and but

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.408
Caption: expertise is a reason to consider some

00:07:03.218 --> 00:07:07.929
Caption: documents if you still need to actually

00:07:05.408 --> 00:07:10.539
Caption: consider their documents and it&#39;s really

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:11.799
Caption: common to actually can ignore the caveat

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:13.658
Caption: that experts will put on their

00:07:11.799 --> 00:07:15.399
Caption: architectures and my place not

00:07:13.658 --> 00:07:17.500
Caption: applicable in X and you go can apply to

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:18.309
Caption: it anyway because you heard that the

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.419
Caption: headline

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:23.949
Caption: X&#39;s right foot Y and a little forth in a

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:28.169
Caption: heat and then you say but I fold it the

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:30.729
Caption: experts um and then you can find anyone

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:32.408
Caption: so pretty common to implement a

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:34.718
Caption: misunderstanding of an architecture

00:07:32.408 --> 00:07:35.619
Caption: rather than actually implementing an

00:07:34.718 --> 00:07:37.630
Caption: architecture

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:40.059
Caption: properly because going and looking at

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.770
Caption: active reading into their data takes a

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:43.329
Caption: while and tedious and boring in the

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:46.629
Caption: focus that things to do is one pineapple

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:48.579
Caption: in extremities and also junior

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.880
Caption: developers do stupid things as you know

00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:54.519
Caption: what&#39;s important now we&#39;ve all done this

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.649
Caption: it&#39;s a normal part of the learning

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:58.750
Caption: process and there&#39;s a thing you develop

00:07:56.649 --> 00:08:01.229
Caption: it your job to correct to your

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.880
Caption: developers without you know

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.410
Caption: you know field stupid or crushing new

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:09.869
Caption: enthusiasm if you were there once

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:12.000
Caption: everybody goes through it so taking

00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:14.579
Caption: examples this is about mid last decade

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.170
Caption: working on a line of business system for

00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:19.049
Caption: government department and this would

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:22.320
Caption: even meant the entire process required

00:08:19.049 --> 00:08:24.329
Caption: to support piece of legislation it was

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.980
Caption: based on a workflow engine for parking

00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:30.059
Caption: with another company and we just didn&#39;t

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:32.190
Caption: know any better and I look to a pretty

00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:35.369
Caption: tight six-month deadline so it was

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:37.080
Caption: defined by the legislation I went live

00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:39.119
Caption: on time and clients actually buy happy

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:42.600
Caption: with it I miss system even won some

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:44.729
Caption: fairly minor awards so it&#39;d be quite

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:47.459
Caption: easy to talk business market wind and

00:08:44.729 --> 00:08:52.079
Caption: move on or there&#39;s no happy client award

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:54.330
Caption: yeah everything great project so that it

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.010
Caption: looks though a number of potential areas

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.290
Caption: for improvement in building this project

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.030
Caption: than in other circumstances if we&#39;re not

00:08:58.289 --> 00:09:04.739
Caption: being quite so lucky could have

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:08.070
Caption: completely derailed it so we implemented

00:09:04.739 --> 00:09:09.390
Caption: this with a web font observant Yui and

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:13.320
Caption: we have an application server the

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:14.850
Caption: person&#39;s web services and we used for

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.160
Caption: more business actions do without er

00:09:14.849 --> 00:09:19.440
Caption: access and that also hosted our workflow

00:09:17.159 --> 00:09:21.750
Caption: engines and we had some other components

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.500
Caption: that aren&#39;t directly relevant here to

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:27.619
Caption: connect our systems so why did we have

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:32.659
Caption: separate webinar creation service well

00:09:27.619 --> 00:09:36.059
Caption: it was the style at the time and

00:09:32.659 --> 00:09:38.159
Caption: Industry to have never benefit to the

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:41.760
Caption: minimal security benefits to separating

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:43.679
Caption: this around and also a difference in how

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:49.140
Caption: we need to scale in and components we&#39;re

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:52.679
Caption: putting on either of them but meant we

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:55.350
Caption: had a lot of layers we had all um we

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:58.409
Caption: have client side UI and web server UI

00:09:55.349 --> 00:10:00.509
Caption: logic and what&#39;s a business logic and

00:09:58.409 --> 00:10:02.639
Caption: then we have client connects to the

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:05.010
Caption: backend and then we have back-end web

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.200
Caption: services and business logic and this

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:09.150
Caption: data access I own an extremely anemic

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.970
Caption: domain model and then eventually we have

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.240
Caption: a database

00:10:10.969 --> 00:10:13.689
Caption: occasionally

00:10:12.239 --> 00:10:16.219
Caption: [Music]

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:18.770
Caption: current another protesting uncountable a

00:10:16.219 --> 00:10:20.629
Caption: momentum so this wasn&#39;t mixed just

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.489
Caption: having mini layers and every single

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:25.010
Caption: operation we did have to go through all

00:10:22.489 --> 00:10:26.659
Caption: of these Labor&#39;s so every single query

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:29.390
Caption: and every single business logic

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:31.129
Caption: operation had to have one of these

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.770
Caption: things in Shaanxi ated and had an

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.239
Caption: additional web service course and so

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:38.200
Caption: most of the plays didn&#39;t actually do

00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:43.010
Caption: very much for that overhead

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:47.080
Caption: so we basically separated the web

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:50.450
Caption: applications open a business as a server

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.489
Caption: introducing unnecessary on network all

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.760
Caption: and that introduces additional latency

00:10:52.489 --> 00:10:59.270
Caption: but it also introduces an additional

00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.830
Caption: risk of failure we also have a one to

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.739
Caption: one foot issues with the design of our

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:07.309
Caption: API so we had a standard set of videos

00:11:03.739 --> 00:11:09.229
Caption: that we used by the web api that means

00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:10.700
Caption: that the same representation of the

00:11:09.229 --> 00:11:14.059
Caption: interview can be used in every single

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:16.489
Caption: case it&#39;s not exactly saving the

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:19.010
Caption: entities themselves across the wire but

00:11:16.489 --> 00:11:21.020
Caption: it&#39;s really impossible because most

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.729
Caption: users don&#39;t actually need all the data

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.440
Caption: on those entities or they needed an

00:11:22.729 --> 00:11:26.089
Caption: alternate format is quite inefficient

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.190
Caption: for attending a lot more stuff around

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.380
Caption: then you actually need to be the vehicle

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.820
Caption: to folks if the client and server have

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.410
Caption: different understandings which part of

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.539
Caption: the data that you populated in this

00:11:33.409 --> 00:11:36.859
Caption: particular call we can bother sending

00:11:35.539 --> 00:11:38.299
Caption: that field because they don&#39;t need is

00:11:36.859 --> 00:11:41.269
Caption: that they don&#39;t need it now now from no

00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:43.880
Caption: reference exception that&#39;s not a great

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:45.679
Caption: way to run a railroad and the

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.500
Caption: temperament inspires the business server

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:51.049
Caption: to Beit repeaters be a pro to us and

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.940
Caption: quite services are an ATM they&#39;re

00:11:51.049 --> 00:11:55.909
Caption: extremely chatty

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.409
Caption: we already have also a more secure or

00:11:55.909 --> 00:11:59.750
Caption: more performant or more stable and more

00:11:57.409 --> 00:12:01.969
Caption: flexible projects and we call it the

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:04.640
Caption: database and some very very smart people

00:12:01.969 --> 00:12:06.769
Caption: work on making that a very great

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.970
Caption: platform and we&#39;re basically slapping a

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:12.320
Caption: layer hoarding operative code

00:12:07.969 --> 00:12:13.599
Caption: approximate so really and then we come

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:18.410
Caption: to this

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:19.849
Caption: so at the time we did perfect I didn&#39;t

00:12:18.409 --> 00:12:21.169
Caption: know if in high night and I&#39;m not

00:12:19.849 --> 00:12:24.979
Caption: actually entirely sure it actually

00:12:21.169 --> 00:12:27.619
Caption: existed at the time I didn&#39;t like yeah I

00:12:24.979 --> 00:12:34.068
Caption: won&#39;t know him because everybody should

00:12:27.619 --> 00:12:36.828
Caption: do that um yeah um I had read tons of

00:12:34.068 --> 00:12:40.369
Caption: education at Kentucky great book and I

00:12:36.828 --> 00:12:42.859
Caption: look like a porter and so long story

00:12:40.369 --> 00:12:45.138
Caption: short I wrote my own room Aaron and I

00:12:42.859 --> 00:12:47.239
Caption: including the client project um it was

00:12:45.138 --> 00:12:49.669
Caption: pretty proven it it requires a lot of

00:12:47.239 --> 00:12:51.258
Caption: custom code for each map entity I&#39;m you

00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:53.179
Caption: need to manually flying into the dirty

00:12:51.258 --> 00:12:55.489
Caption: you need to still write a favor to

00:12:53.179 --> 00:12:56.929
Caption: sequel yourself and they didn&#39;t really

00:12:55.489 --> 00:13:00.018
Caption: support custom queries particular world

00:12:56.929 --> 00:13:03.250
Caption: um so the interesting exercise but it

00:13:00.018 --> 00:13:08.688
Caption: should never fall into production

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:10.219
Caption: episode but I had any bug unit in how it

00:13:08.689 --> 00:13:11.959
Caption: implemented many community collections

00:13:10.219 --> 00:13:13.698
Caption: not a great way to represent entities

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:18.799
Caption: but we had a lot of the minister declare

00:13:13.698 --> 00:13:21.828
Caption: design and this buzz would never hit in

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:25.578
Caption: happy Holi application if you use do is

00:13:21.828 --> 00:13:28.039
Caption: our own but as I&#39;ve moved on

00:13:25.578 --> 00:13:31.338
Caption: the support team working migrations will

00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:33.258
Caption: be used it and they hit above and it

00:13:31.338 --> 00:13:37.638
Caption: wiped out all the associations between a

00:13:33.258 --> 00:13:41.289
Caption: whole bunch of entities if actually

00:13:37.638 --> 00:13:43.669
Caption: deleted them all network wasn&#39;t back and

00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:47.419
Caption: something complained of dirty anything

00:13:43.669 --> 00:13:49.338
Caption: from the back um so that was fun that

00:13:47.419 --> 00:13:53.000
Caption: was a really fun support call to get to

00:13:49.338 --> 00:13:54.409
Caption: the team fortunately they hadn&#39;t

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.849
Caption: actually done a live on production we

00:13:54.409 --> 00:13:58.159
Caption: have various others blackouts and so

00:13:55.849 --> 00:14:00.398
Caption: anyone against that was an interesting

00:13:58.159 --> 00:14:00.398
Caption: course

00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:09.318
Caption: so yes other poems um so we got the

00:14:07.609 --> 00:14:11.299
Caption: system round of workflow engine and in

00:14:09.318 --> 00:14:13.518
Caption: order to participate in transactions

00:14:11.299 --> 00:14:15.299
Caption: without worth 500 or your code needs to

00:14:13.518 --> 00:14:18.719
Caption: be registered in wonderful Microsoft

00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:20.669
Caption: you can reverse that introduced a

00:14:18.719 --> 00:14:23.039
Caption: registration step after booking

00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:24.929
Caption: application service solutions and if you

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:27.329
Caption: forgot to do that step and sometimes

00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:31.409
Caption: everything would work and sometimes it

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:34.079
Caption: wouldn&#39;t there&#39;s a lot of friction to

00:14:31.409 --> 00:14:36.148
Caption: the drilling process we already had two

00:14:34.078 --> 00:14:38.969
Caption: solutions and the whole world of low

00:14:36.148 --> 00:14:41.789
Caption: value layers so more friction what&#39;s an

00:14:38.969 --> 00:14:44.069
Caption: exacting formula and on least one

00:14:41.789 --> 00:14:46.679
Caption: occasion I had I rented to complain to

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:49.619
Caption: my coworker by getting angry and telling

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:51.510
Caption: them essentially through hard enough and

00:14:49.619 --> 00:14:55.049
Caption: I really owe people apology to that

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:57.169
Caption: because I should not have done their way

00:14:55.049 --> 00:14:59.659
Caption: to that friction could have been reduced

00:14:57.169 --> 00:15:02.898
Caption: but I didn&#39;t implement any of them

00:14:59.659 --> 00:15:05.759
Caption: because you know I was doing I was

00:15:02.898 --> 00:15:08.909
Caption: actively ignoring feedback from my

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:10.828
Caption: co-workers on that the architect had a

00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:13.528
Caption: defect they were telling me that I was

00:15:10.828 --> 00:15:15.268
Caption: not reacting to that feedback and that

00:15:13.528 --> 00:15:15.690
Caption: was partly because I donated work on

00:15:15.268 --> 00:15:16.979
Caption: that stuff

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.229
Caption: pre dealing outputting a lot of

00:15:16.979 --> 00:15:22.619
Caption: infrastructure stuff so you purchased me

00:15:19.229 --> 00:15:25.320
Caption: as a significant issue now the time it

00:15:22.619 --> 00:15:27.719
Caption: would have taken me to fix that wood

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:31.578
Caption: paper took many times over in reduce

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:31.578
Caption: overhead for the rest of the scene so

00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:36.958
Caption: lesson five don&#39;t distribute without

00:15:35.159 --> 00:15:38.639
Caption: reason adding communication verb in it

00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.929
Caption: and the different failure point has to

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.660
Caption: be something you can justify with

00:15:39.929 --> 00:15:43.739
Caption: concrete answers if in general you&#39;re

00:15:42.659 --> 00:15:45.690
Caption: going to see more weight into

00:15:43.739 --> 00:15:47.520
Caption: distributor logic horizontally great

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:50.220
Caption: house different areas of functionality

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:53.550
Caption: rather than separating out your

00:15:50.219 --> 00:15:55.319
Caption: different vertical layers this is not

00:15:53.549 --> 00:15:59.099
Caption: staged blue moon entirely synchronous

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.449
Caption: models but it&#39;s basically an argument to

00:15:59.099 --> 00:16:02.849
Caption: be intelligence about leaving your

00:16:00.448 --> 00:16:04.078
Caption: boundaries where that will be depends on

00:16:02.849 --> 00:16:06.778
Caption: your cooking classification

00:16:04.078 --> 00:16:08.729
Caption: just think about them don&#39;t just put in

00:16:06.778 --> 00:16:13.078
Caption: an application server everybody has when

00:16:08.729 --> 00:16:15.659
Caption: they tell you your models to be you

00:16:13.078 --> 00:16:17.760
Caption: since recently do it is massively

00:16:15.659 --> 00:16:20.578
Caption: massively accelerated

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.979
Caption: defining a de o is easy and thick and

00:16:20.578 --> 00:16:24.699
Caption: with learn more key columns much they

00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:28.059
Caption: have very very low maintenance over

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:31.090
Caption: a mapping directly into the format you

00:16:28.059 --> 00:16:33.250
Caption: actually use and need is significantly

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:35.470
Caption: much more efficient more expressive and

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.179
Caption: less error-prone doesn&#39;t call the

00:16:35.469 --> 00:16:41.019
Caption: confusion of to what parts of the model

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:45.219
Caption: is actually populated or what the and

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:48.130
Caption: operation needs structural similarity no

00:16:45.219 --> 00:16:50.109
Caption: reason to share models the couples

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:53.500
Caption: public functionality that you may wish

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:56.200
Caption: to separate all very independently in

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:58.510
Caption: future German could be restricted to

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.460
Caption: basically only the very low-level data

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:02.440
Caption: types and it generally needs to be

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:06.458
Caption: something that&#39;s actually consistent

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:09.189
Caption: everywhere maybe an exact format but

00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:11.739
Caption: there aren&#39;t very many other examples in

00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:13.379
Caption: one system there are relatively few

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:17.729
Caption: models that are actually going to be

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.729
Caption: treated like that as an atomic unit

00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:23.679
Caption: don&#39;t like frameworks unless you really

00:17:20.229 --> 00:17:25.599
Caption: really need to some like a framework and

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.840
Caption: I&#39;m running an hour a mile of fun

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:30.819
Caption: exercise I look successful and that

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:32.159
Caption: being honestly wasn&#39;t anything in what

00:17:30.819 --> 00:17:35.439
Caption: would qualify as a real production

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.239
Caption: quality RA who would basically

00:17:35.439 --> 00:17:42.969
Caption: convoluted data access layer with

00:17:37.239 --> 00:17:45.910
Caption: delusions of grandeur writing framework

00:17:42.969 --> 00:17:48.849
Caption: doesn&#39;t add business value they may need

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:50.710
Caption: an able to deliver better to better

00:17:48.849 --> 00:17:52.059
Caption: deliver business value with other code

00:17:50.709 --> 00:17:55.390
Caption: but you need to be able to actually

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:57.490
Caption: justify that doing that very long and

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:59.979
Caption: hard before you are building alternative

00:17:57.489 --> 00:18:01.510
Caption: things that exist and also consider

00:17:59.979 --> 00:18:04.449
Caption: where you actually need them in the

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:06.310
Caption: first place a standard you know one of

00:18:04.449 --> 00:18:08.289
Caption: the mill directors Laden or and

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:12.190
Caption: component or probably exists is programs

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:15.250
Caption: a lot better and also we have to see

00:18:12.189 --> 00:18:18.669
Caption: that feedback is necessary correct

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:20.530
Caption: errors and everything has errors we

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.770
Caption: don&#39;t acknowledge or errors you can fix

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:26.320
Caption: them in and they accumulate over time

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:28.239
Caption: now and not picking architectures has

00:18:26.319 --> 00:18:31.719
Caption: significant cost in terms of wasted

00:18:28.239 --> 00:18:35.020
Caption: effort and increase defects so when

00:18:31.719 --> 00:18:37.579
Caption: people you see that record also develop

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:40.729
Caption: teams succeed or fail collectively

00:18:37.579 --> 00:18:44.449
Caption: no one cares house when your code is if

00:18:40.729 --> 00:18:46.369
Caption: the system doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s really easy

00:18:44.449 --> 00:18:48.378
Caption: to get siloed I&#39;m doing this thing and

00:18:46.369 --> 00:18:52.279
Caption: everyone else can go to hell

00:18:48.379 --> 00:18:54.440
Caption: that doesn&#39;t help getting all your

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:56.690
Caption: things done look expensive your team

00:18:54.439 --> 00:18:59.388
Caption: team members in our profession and

00:18:56.689 --> 00:19:02.178
Caption: working well in a team is key developer

00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:03.830
Caption: skill so I would really attend X

00:19:02.178 --> 00:19:04.849
Caption: development or you&#39;re just putting all

00:19:03.829 --> 00:19:15.258
Caption: your work on a future maintenance

00:19:04.849 --> 00:19:17.058
Caption: intelligence so two point five letters

00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:19.429
Caption: of the previous system which you know

00:19:17.058 --> 00:19:23.569
Caption: was written with certain we involved in

00:19:19.428 --> 00:19:26.089
Caption: couples other similar projects these

00:19:23.569 --> 00:19:28.248
Caption: were not successful many of the factors

00:19:26.089 --> 00:19:30.109
Caption: in that don&#39;t be for me personally I&#39;m

00:19:28.249 --> 00:19:37.639
Caption: not going to go over but they were a few

00:19:30.109 --> 00:19:39.469
Caption: things and so so one project had water

00:19:37.639 --> 00:19:41.960
Caption: requirements that we know performing

00:19:39.469 --> 00:19:46.158
Caption: accidents in the system and one way that

00:19:41.959 --> 00:19:48.768
Caption: you can order everything that somebody

00:19:46.159 --> 00:19:50.450
Caption: does is to popularity between servers

00:19:48.769 --> 00:19:54.679
Caption: servers using Kerberos and log

00:19:50.449 --> 00:19:56.988
Caption: everything so I had that extra sense

00:19:54.678 --> 00:20:00.949
Caption: that it can be done

00:19:56.989 --> 00:20:02.839
Caption: I mean domain recommending it&#39;s almost

00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:07.099
Caption: certainly bad idea to propagate your

00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:09.258
Caption: user empty walkway down to database but

00:20:07.099 --> 00:20:11.058
Caption: let&#39;s say you&#39;re like me and you

00:20:09.259 --> 00:20:13.700
Caption: accidentally said you would do it in a

00:20:11.058 --> 00:20:17.898
Caption: tender response and now you&#39;re kind of

00:20:13.699 --> 00:20:20.449
Caption: stuck with it so we did that and you

00:20:17.899 --> 00:20:21.889
Caption: could tell who did anything against the

00:20:20.449 --> 00:20:24.469
Caption: database and now it&#39;s night we had some

00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:28.489
Caption: all the tables populated by triggers and

00:20:24.469 --> 00:20:32.239
Caption: don&#39;t that I look anyway your work fine

00:20:28.489 --> 00:20:34.549
Caption: and everyone&#39;s developing scene okay and

00:20:32.239 --> 00:20:36.259
Caption: and then we went to an environment of

00:20:34.548 --> 00:20:39.618
Caption: more like production which we didn&#39;t get

00:20:36.259 --> 00:20:43.009
Caption: immediately and that had more servers

00:20:39.619 --> 00:20:45.099
Caption: and it did not work at all to the extent

00:20:43.009 --> 00:20:46.599
Caption: that every single service call failed

00:20:45.099 --> 00:20:50.030
Caption: which

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:51.859
Caption: so how many Kerberos works differently

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.840
Caption: between services that are all running on

00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:57.969
Caption: the same machine versus services and

00:20:53.839 --> 00:21:00.619
Caption: running on different machines with

00:20:57.969 --> 00:21:03.669
Caption: culatta method getting that work

00:21:00.619 --> 00:21:08.089
Caption: unfortunately we discover that very late

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:10.730
Caption: - a long time to get things working and

00:21:08.089 --> 00:21:12.558
Caption: we should have changed approach that we

00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:16.390
Caption: committed to it and we call the changing

00:21:12.558 --> 00:21:18.979
Caption: our approach was difficult politically

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:24.829
Caption: which was not a good reason to make an

00:21:18.979 --> 00:21:26.390
Caption: architectural decision so a different

00:21:24.829 --> 00:21:28.250
Caption: messaging excellent for decoupling

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.678
Caption: components it removes your tackle

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:34.339
Caption: coupling allows required allotment

00:21:30.678 --> 00:21:36.619
Caption: reordering pub/sub allows models where

00:21:34.339 --> 00:21:40.209
Caption: an event-driven model where consumers

00:21:36.619 --> 00:21:42.890
Caption: don&#39;t have to be known to this producer

00:21:40.209 --> 00:21:46.539
Caption: it&#39;s also a terrible default for

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:49.880
Caption: consuming all commands in a system to

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:52.790
Caption: get a result is something that you

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:55.400
Caption: submit synchronously to acquire you can

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:57.979
Caption: poll you can notify the user a

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.359
Caption: synchronously such as by email or you

00:21:57.979 --> 00:22:01.010
Caption: can lie to them and tell them that

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:02.510
Caption: something&#39;s being done and then just

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:05.270
Caption: hope it actually does succeed in the

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:07.219
Caption: background and none of those options are

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:09.650
Caption: particularly good and I&#39;m holding is

00:22:07.219 --> 00:22:11.659
Caption: expensive to implementer to run and I

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.099
Caption: think notifications are not always

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.200
Caption: appropriate to keeping in business

00:22:13.099 --> 00:22:16.760
Caption: processes you don&#39;t really want to be

00:22:15.199 --> 00:22:18.919
Caption: half way to really through filling out a

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.329
Caption: form you click Next and it will send you

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.330
Caption: an email when you can fill out the next

00:22:20.329 --> 00:22:25.549
Caption: pages system that&#39;s not going to work

00:22:22.329 --> 00:22:27.380
Caption: and why want to risk of distrust of

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:29.980
Caption: destroying user trust in the system

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:35.780
Caption: because the system is lying to them and

00:22:29.979 --> 00:22:38.569
Caption: fairly hoping so XML

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:42.239
Caption: everyone loved XML last decade then

00:22:38.569 --> 00:22:49.599
Caption: everyone was Jatin this decade and

00:22:42.239 --> 00:22:51.339
Caption: we love next decade emoji hurt autism&#39;s

00:22:49.599 --> 00:22:54.219
Caption: of any scale need some little

00:22:51.339 --> 00:22:55.630
Caption: configuration and that tends to end up

00:22:54.219 --> 00:22:58.538
Caption: in configuration files which in this

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:01.808
Caption: project were XML and a configuration

00:22:58.538 --> 00:23:06.548
Caption: went slightly overboard we use or the

00:23:01.808 --> 00:23:08.288
Caption: excellent you can&#39;t have any XML we&#39;ve

00:23:06.548 --> 00:23:11.949
Caption: used all of it on this project there&#39;s

00:23:08.288 --> 00:23:13.778
Caption: no more left so in addition to your

00:23:11.949 --> 00:23:16.500
Caption: standard web config with Microsoft

00:23:13.779 --> 00:23:19.059
Caption: themselves we don&#39;t always connect demo

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.918
Caption: moving the network mobile web sites and

00:23:19.058 --> 00:23:22.808
Caption: we had XML configuration to all of our

00:23:20.918 --> 00:23:26.139
Caption: dependency injection everything within

00:23:22.808 --> 00:23:28.140
Caption: the injected was completed by XML so we

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:30.159
Caption: have literally thousands of lines of XML

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:33.520
Caption: in fact you&#39;ve never done this

00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:36.070
Caption: specifying generic types in XML is not

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:40.359
Caption: fun and really really really easy to get

00:23:36.069 --> 00:23:44.019
Caption: wrong and really really really hard to

00:23:40.359 --> 00:23:46.058
Caption: get buzz when you do and it needed to be

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:48.399
Caption: modified every single time anybody out

00:23:46.058 --> 00:23:49.808
Caption: of the service class which meant a lot

00:23:48.399 --> 00:23:52.600
Caption: of people will modify anything that&#39;s

00:23:49.808 --> 00:23:55.239
Caption: really easy to get Raman really hard to

00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:56.798
Caption: debug so that&#39;s problematic positive

00:23:55.239 --> 00:23:59.949
Caption: sort of merge conflicts which isn&#39;t

00:23:56.798 --> 00:24:01.569
Caption: another source above so it&#39;s pretty much

00:23:59.949 --> 00:24:05.589
Caption: guaranteed that people change something

00:24:01.569 --> 00:24:08.048
Caption: incorrectly wait there&#39;s more yes and

00:24:05.589 --> 00:24:10.839
Caption: also we also define all about very very

00:24:08.048 --> 00:24:13.959
Caption: fine-grained permissions in XML so it

00:24:10.839 --> 00:24:17.109
Caption: multiple roles and which services a role

00:24:13.959 --> 00:24:18.908
Caption: could call we&#39;re determined by large XML

00:24:17.109 --> 00:24:20.558
Caption: files and when I say services I mean

00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:23.409
Caption: every single method at its own

00:24:20.558 --> 00:24:26.918
Caption: configuration we&#39;re bypassing that

00:24:23.409 --> 00:24:30.429
Caption: problem and that really excusing from

00:24:26.918 --> 00:24:33.398
Caption: core services fine-grained permissions

00:24:30.428 --> 00:24:35.048
Caption: on a primitive edges to get huge

00:24:33.399 --> 00:24:38.559
Caption: overhead and it&#39;s really difficult to

00:24:35.048 --> 00:24:40.418
Caption: change involved is what roles can do

00:24:38.558 --> 00:24:42.788
Caption: changes or if you have a new role

00:24:40.418 --> 00:24:49.148
Caption: remover all we merge them or split them

00:24:42.788 --> 00:24:50.769
Caption: and yeah it&#39;s not fun at all so testing

00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:52.149
Caption: architecture should be done in something

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.639
Caption: that actually will place in production

00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:55.410
Caption: environments your laptop in most cases

00:24:54.639 --> 00:24:57.390
Caption: doesn&#39;t

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:59.040
Caption: quite a collection is bones you should

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.989
Caption: do this early and you should do it

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.510
Caption: before you commit to that architecture

00:25:00.989 --> 00:25:04.969
Caption: because once you commit to something it

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.719
Caption: gets really expensive to change

00:25:04.969 --> 00:25:09.989
Caption: particulate there are contractual

00:25:06.719 --> 00:25:11.640
Caption: restrictions on what you can do it you

00:25:09.989 --> 00:25:13.500
Caption: need to make it as realistic so you

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.329
Caption: don&#39;t miss things and tapping on a

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.250
Caption: single machine is the completely

00:25:15.329 --> 00:25:21.179
Caption: different security behavior that occurs

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:23.489
Caption: with multi machine and finding our 300

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.650
Caption: workers end of the project with your

00:25:23.489 --> 00:25:27.030
Caption: deadline rapidly approaching is highly

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:30.950
Caption: unpleasant I don&#39;t recommend that

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:33.090
Caption: experience if you fighting system

00:25:30.949 --> 00:25:35.789
Caption: consider a different approach rather

00:25:33.089 --> 00:25:37.319
Caption: than continuing to bang on solution if

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.869
Caption: you perfect isn&#39;t working you

00:25:37.319 --> 00:25:41.669
Caption: potentially got talking you can keep it

00:25:39.869 --> 00:25:43.619
Caption: spending effort and I hope you somehow

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:47.040
Caption: get things to work even though you

00:25:43.619 --> 00:25:47.609
Caption: haven&#39;t yet or even though this is not

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.609
Caption: going to happen

00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:55.709
Caption: see if you can come to goal some other

00:25:50.609 --> 00:25:57.719
Caption: way now security propagation problem had

00:25:55.709 --> 00:26:00.329
Caption: a solution but took a lot of my time

00:25:57.719 --> 00:26:01.979
Caption: took the time of contractor and also one

00:26:00.329 --> 00:26:04.500
Caption: of our infrastructure people to find

00:26:01.979 --> 00:26:05.780
Caption: that and that it could be much better

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.189
Caption: spent elsewhere

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.619
Caption: now also other ways we could have

00:26:08.189 --> 00:26:13.609
Caption: accomplished the actual objective of the

00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:16.619
Caption: client in a much more effective fashion

00:26:13.609 --> 00:26:18.270
Caption: so we got stuck on a solution that

00:26:16.619 --> 00:26:20.010
Caption: instead we could have been focusing on

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:24.209
Caption: satisfying the actual business

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:26.010

Caption: potential source of life so

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:38.989

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.910
Caption: system to support core business

00:28:38.989 --> 00:28:42.429

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.720
Caption: pretentious way of saying it&#39;s a new

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:47.750
Caption: system to do important stuff that a

00:28:44.719 --> 00:28:49.939
Caption: business relied upon and you would

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:53.060
Caption: booktubeathon entered and we had a lot

00:28:49.939 --> 00:28:54.889
Caption: of them so many services and it was

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.170
Caption: built with no one business people have

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:59.150
Caption: worked with and your system is in use

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:01.880
Caption: currently and it&#39;s delivering seen

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:03.920
Caption: consistent values so that would mean

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:11.810
Caption: that you know everybody normal is ideal

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:14.540
Caption: and perfect so this hasn&#39;t had on the

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:17.300
Caption: order of hundred services that&#39;s quite a

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:19.160
Caption: lot of services and every single one of

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.570
Caption: these services is fundamentally the same

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.840
Caption: architecture and infrastructure

00:29:20.569 --> 00:29:26.839
Caption: implementation and one is not a lot of

00:29:23.839 --> 00:29:31.309
Caption: architectural styles for hundred

00:29:26.839 --> 00:29:33.289
Caption: services I want to give strokin full

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:35.050
Caption: nice features were refined error

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:37.700
Caption: handling an automatic registration of

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:39.040
Caption: handlers and all kinds of wonderful fun

00:29:37.699 --> 00:29:42.349
Caption: stuff

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:45.050
Caption: the single approach did not suit all

00:29:42.349 --> 00:29:47.479
Caption: elements of system some things just need

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:49.369
Caption: several products some things need really

00:29:47.479 --> 00:29:52.160
Caption: to edit domain modeling and some things

00:29:49.369 --> 00:29:54.290
Caption: kind of end up in here so no one

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:58.609
Caption: architecture is going to capture the

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:59.780
Caption: requirement of every single element so

00:29:58.609 --> 00:30:01.910
Caption: start building the infrastructure

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:03.710
Caption: I built the simplest domain that we had

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:06.500
Caption: so I can validate the infrastructure

00:30:03.709 --> 00:30:09.409
Caption: work and I thought implemented as neat

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:12.140
Caption: as anemic domain model with transaction

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:14.810
Caption: scripts now it was easy to do that and

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:16.190
Caption: as the simplest domain we had for

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:18.650
Caption: communications logic in it

00:30:16.189 --> 00:30:21.529
Caption: and then I call it good and I would want

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:22.969
Caption: to do other things and then the team we

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:26.030
Caption: want to do much more complex domain

00:30:22.969 --> 00:30:28.130
Caption: using a simple domain that I built as a

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:30.140
Caption: template and it turns out the

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:33.319
Caption: transaction scripts don&#39;t scare world to

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:35.719
Caption: convert domains they didn&#39;t produce very

00:30:33.319 --> 00:30:38.329
Caption: beautiful objects paper is poor models

00:30:35.719 --> 00:30:40.939
Caption: that don&#39;t express business concept

00:30:38.329 --> 00:30:41.559
Caption: clearly they on tribute business rules

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:45.579
Caption: are

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:47.470
Caption: in first Walter procedural code and so

00:30:45.579 --> 00:30:50.049
Caption: Webster&#39;s finds everything&#39;s basically

00:30:47.469 --> 00:30:52.559
Caption: no difference they can be actively

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:55.090
Caption: harmful to into the complex amount and

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.280
Caption: by the time this became a pound I&#39;ve

00:30:55.089 --> 00:30:58.839
Caption: locked into design features that make

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.030
Caption: switching to a richer domain model

00:30:58.839 --> 00:31:06.489
Caption: problematic not impossible but more

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:08.320
Caption: elaborated than it should be so the axis

00:31:06.489 --> 00:31:11.709
Caption: we have you identified service small

00:31:08.319 --> 00:31:13.509
Caption: services really quite heavily generally

00:31:11.709 --> 00:31:15.969
Caption: we had a single aggregate for their

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:17.709
Caption: service and this was based on how we

00:31:15.969 --> 00:31:19.209
Caption: decided to implement some of the

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:21.909
Caption: fundamental design patterns of the

00:31:19.209 --> 00:31:23.919
Caption: system and that&#39;s not without its costs

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:26.859
Caption: a lot more moving pieces to deployed

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:33.970
Caption: it&#39;s a lot more configuration it&#39;s a lot

00:31:26.859 --> 00:31:35.920
Caption: more into service communication so we

00:31:33.969 --> 00:31:39.549
Caption: really should approach more relative

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.050
Caption: concept in Africa concept book needs the

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:44.680
Caption: structure against the simplest domain

00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:46.210
Caption: here we had more complex domains that

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.910
Caption: would have significant issues with some

00:31:46.209 --> 00:31:50.349
Caption: of our implementation decision a more

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.910
Caption: complex process context will have

00:31:50.349 --> 00:31:54.309
Caption: illustrated in our services which is

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:56.290
Caption: ingrained and potentially we have built

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:58.480
Caption: one simple service in isolation as a

00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:00.940
Caption: proof of concept for system we&#39;ve had

00:31:58.479 --> 00:32:03.369
Caption: multiple complex services interacting

00:32:00.939 --> 00:32:08.559
Caption: and that did not prove the concepts that

00:32:03.369 --> 00:32:10.209
Caption: we actually needed to so each component

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.620
Caption: could have been built with an

00:32:10.209 --> 00:32:13.869
Caption: architecture that actually matched its

00:32:11.619 --> 00:32:16.239
Caption: requirements environment and importance

00:32:13.869 --> 00:32:18.880
Caption: over Engineering has implementation

00:32:16.239 --> 00:32:21.729
Caption: costs to be more expensive to deploy and

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.589
Caption: run and maintain bit under engineering

00:32:21.729 --> 00:32:27.010
Caption: can also result in high B X and

00:32:23.589 --> 00:32:31.059
Caption: therefore destination so other ways many

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:34.750
Caption: more maintaining an initial low quality

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:37.000
Caption: models don&#39;t really Express the domain

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:39.609
Caption: of fishermen they generally produce a

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.069
Caption: lot of duplicated procedural code that a

00:32:39.609 --> 00:32:43.809
Caption: cleaner model will eliminate and ideally

00:32:42.069 --> 00:32:46.269
Caption: you could do simple things as simple

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:48.280
Caption: services and more complex into the

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:49.869
Caption: complex services for that in quite well

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.260
Caption: you need to constrain stead of

00:32:49.869 --> 00:32:54.739
Caption: architectures to choose from rather than

00:32:53.260 --> 00:33:01.099
Caption: a single architecture that

00:32:54.739 --> 00:33:04.010
Caption: not suitable for many of your cases so

00:33:01.099 --> 00:33:06.079
Caption: major to microservices apart from the

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:08.989
Caption: abuse by market everywhere

00:33:06.079 --> 00:33:11.779
Caption: is that it specifies the size of a

00:33:08.989 --> 00:33:15.530
Caption: service in the name services should be

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:18.349
Caption: large enough to do something well and no

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:20.540
Caption: larger but specifying that there should

00:33:18.349 --> 00:33:22.459
Caption: be micro tends to make you focus on how

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:26.390
Caption: can i cutting out reducers even if

00:33:22.459 --> 00:33:28.729
Caption: lamenting for it something

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:30.380
Caption: how large something is and what do

00:33:28.729 --> 00:33:32.900
Caption: depends on context has no real right

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.729
Caption: answer so a wrong answers so and making

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.969
Caption: every service into literally the

00:33:34.729 --> 00:33:39.410
Caption: smallest possible thing is one of them

00:33:36.969 --> 00:33:41.390
Caption: something naturally come together and it

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:50.780
Caption: makes sense to group things together

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:56.109
Caption: service so if you are the random things

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:59.809
Caption: um so we can circle fault frameworks and

00:33:56.109 --> 00:34:10.760
Caption: fairly common trap and I&#39;m solution and

00:33:59.808 --> 00:34:12.408
Caption: now what&#39;s your problem I should have

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.709
Caption: actually said that if I had never made

00:34:12.408 --> 00:34:16.219
Caption: it home with SharePoint I made it with

00:34:15.709 --> 00:34:18.560
Caption: other things

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:20.000
Caption: oh so it&#39;s ok expected you&#39;ll be

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.520
Caption: familiar with particular tools and

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.648
Caption: frameworks that&#39;s part of your drug but

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.119
Caption: what&#39;s not okay is pulling the meteor

00:34:24.648 --> 00:34:28.668
Caption: project immediately would happen to

00:34:26.118 --> 00:34:30.378
Caption: learn apparently adding their values I&#39;m

00:34:28.668 --> 00:34:32.418
Caption: accept him Splinter overly complex

00:34:30.378 --> 00:34:36.199
Caption: illusions that have more infrastructure

00:34:32.418 --> 00:34:37.939
Caption: than the project actually wants and one

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:41.329
Caption: bleeding vendors in this space for many

00:34:37.939 --> 00:34:43.128
Caption: issues of di containers di containers

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:47.179
Caption: are great and in many domains they add

00:34:43.128 --> 00:34:50.689
Caption: an awful lot value but using them is not

00:34:47.178 --> 00:34:53.510
Caption: free quite relatives to understand the

00:34:50.689 --> 00:34:55.459
Caption: are conventions that are in use complex

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:57.739
Caption: registration can obscure how things

00:34:55.459 --> 00:35:00.439
Caption: actually fit together and lead to errors

00:34:57.739 --> 00:35:01.459
Caption: default assumptions and there&#39;s a very

00:35:00.439 --> 00:35:03.530
Caption: simple program

00:35:01.459 --> 00:35:07.399
Caption: the cost of using the making I wanted

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:13.280
Caption: maybe you should just use a ICN you know

00:35:07.399 --> 00:35:14.869
Caption: continued dependence of any current in

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.570
Caption: addition to the fact that I wrote my own

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:20.390
Caption: and also very powerful tools and I have

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:23.060
Caption: massively over used them in particular

00:35:20.389 --> 00:35:26.289
Caption: using iron so queries generally terribly

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:30.170
Caption: inefficient said large amount of time

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:33.380
Caption: trying to write simple queries in what

00:35:30.169 --> 00:35:35.149
Caption: would be a simple query planner in I was

00:35:33.379 --> 00:35:36.879
Caption: writing in sequel but I&#39;m trying to use

00:35:35.149 --> 00:35:42.159
Caption: the our own API so make them incredibly

00:35:36.879 --> 00:35:44.509
Caption: incredibly difficult Thank You economy

00:35:42.159 --> 00:35:48.079
Caption: so that&#39;s really not institution like to

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:50.659
Caption: do things and now LinkedIn making less

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:53.270
Caption: terrible but still not as effective to

00:35:50.659 --> 00:35:55.039
Caption: many complex groups so quite often you

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:56.689
Caption: know what you&#39;re doing is just broad

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.270
Caption: sequel queries that elevation maps

00:35:56.689 --> 00:36:01.520
Caption: training program and that&#39;s been quite

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:03.020
Caption: not famous out there for doing that now

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.500
Caption: that don&#39;t mean you to have to deal with

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:11.510
Caption: out yard of net that you can still write

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:13.939
Caption: a sequel quite efficiently so probably

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:16.699
Caption: would speak to the orange is the mix

00:36:13.939 --> 00:36:19.069
Caption: feature called lazy loading so let me

00:36:16.699 --> 00:36:21.229
Caption: I&#39;ll do that a lot

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:23.239
Caption: it&#39;s a really great way of ensuring that

00:36:21.229 --> 00:36:26.419
Caption: you have to put up performance issues

00:36:23.239 --> 00:36:28.250
Caption: inside a firm because you will use it

00:36:26.419 --> 00:36:30.290
Caption: and you&#39;ll be fine all your production

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.790
Caption: on your development data set and then

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:33.979
Caption: you go into production and it&#39;s pulling

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:35.630
Caption: in half the database and your database

00:36:33.979 --> 00:36:37.369
Caption: is a terabyte in some you meet in your

00:36:35.629 --> 00:36:38.679
Caption: system pulled over and your own popular

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:40.280
Caption: and five

00:36:38.679 --> 00:36:44.429
Caption: [Music]

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:46.140
Caption: so um it&#39;s also really great might have

00:36:44.429 --> 00:36:49.949
Caption: coffee and data access users in your

00:36:46.139 --> 00:36:52.199
Caption: presentation life because I think being

00:36:49.949 --> 00:36:54.329
Caption: legally loaded way up and rendering the

00:36:52.199 --> 00:36:57.149
Caption: page when you know it should be queried

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:59.010
Caption: already so we can query data base you

00:36:57.149 --> 00:37:00.209
Caption: should basically retreat everything you

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:02.550
Caption: need in one operations

00:37:00.209 --> 00:37:04.349
Caption: let&#39;s return a simple model that

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:06.570
Caption: conforms to the data format your users

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:08.280
Caption: actually means you pass that up and it&#39;s

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:16.469
Caption: done and you do no further database

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:18.979
Caption: operations so we often structure code

00:37:16.469 --> 00:37:21.419
Caption: because we need to be able to test it

00:37:18.979 --> 00:37:23.070
Caption: now the only reason your code is

00:37:21.419 --> 00:37:24.599
Caption: structured the way it is is to enabled

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:27.479
Caption: testing that I might even started as

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:30.440
Caption: well the candidate that tends to produce

00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:32.790
Caption: code with a large number of mocks

00:37:30.439 --> 00:37:34.290
Caption: mocking frameworks are great for what

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.300
Caption: they do there are certain cases you

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:38.310
Caption: can&#39;t really pass without them but you

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:41.040
Caption: should not be defined for kinda blocks

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:43.500
Caption: out the rest of your system just to test

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:45.570
Caption: anything in isolation that&#39;s probably a

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:48.780
Caption: warning sign and destruction is not as

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:50.870
Caption: efficient including the warning signs

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:54.239
Caption: and I&#39;ve got all of this stuff is

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:56.250
Caption: inheritance hierarchies in hex and how

00:37:54.239 --> 00:37:57.869
Caption: much stuff do you need to setup that you

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:59.639
Caption: need to have a five level big

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:02.640
Caption: inheritance hierarchy to set up with

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:04.859
Caption: those pictures large constructors and

00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:06.510
Caption: test classes that you&#39;ve got a whole lot

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.550
Caption: of state and if you have to magically

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:11.550
Caption: remember how it works every time the

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:15.209
Caption: Esprit that&#39;s not going to be a fun

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:18.150
Caption: experience and having a lot more setup

00:38:15.209 --> 00:38:21.030
Caption: code than code and use and test suggests

00:38:18.149 --> 00:38:23.129
Caption: that you&#39;ve got a very context for code

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:28.169
Caption: that isn&#39;t actually delivering all that

00:38:23.129 --> 00:38:30.479
Caption: much other so um conventions

00:38:28.169 --> 00:38:32.969
Caption: everybody loves arguing about Europe

00:38:30.479 --> 00:38:34.619
Caption: where we should put our raters and where

00:38:32.969 --> 00:38:36.709
Caption: we should put up spaces it up and you

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:41.010
Caption: statement you&#39;re inside this bracket so

00:38:36.709 --> 00:38:42.359
Caption: nobody can compile it doesn&#39;t care and

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.979
Caption: I&#39;ve called meetings and written

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:47.400
Caption: documents to define coding

00:38:43.979 --> 00:38:51.209
Caption: and allegedly giving probe consistent

00:38:47.399 --> 00:38:53.669
Caption: has a lot of value um telling developers

00:38:51.209 --> 00:38:55.469
Caption: to tell is built right roughly in line

00:38:53.669 --> 00:38:57.739
Caption: with language convention to Mexico

00:38:55.469 --> 00:39:00.090
Caption: burrito if you can&#39;t read the code

00:38:57.739 --> 00:39:02.189
Caption: embraces next to the if statement rather

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:07.380
Caption: on a new line there&#39;s something deeply

00:39:02.189 --> 00:39:11.389
Caption: wrong we do and you know not just to

00:39:07.379 --> 00:39:14.519
Caption: direct this publishing the around it so

00:39:11.389 --> 00:39:16.789
Caption: don&#39;t feel reusable libraries little

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.619
Caption: fully reasonable opponent is hard

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:23.669
Caption: platform vendors will try and cover

00:39:19.618 --> 00:39:25.409
Caption: fundamentals and you know the cases

00:39:23.669 --> 00:39:27.599
Caption: where they don&#39;t think no people who

00:39:25.409 --> 00:39:29.429
Caption: will provide you compose maybe the other

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.859
Caption: stuff and some of them may or may not be

00:39:29.429 --> 00:39:35.280
Caption: watching this conference opens change

00:39:31.858 --> 00:39:37.019
Caption: their line since Melbourne um so they

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.280
Caption: were what matters that development a lot

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.169
Caption: more than you&#39;re going to be able to

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.989
Caption: relive a poem happiest legal and mock

00:39:40.169 --> 00:39:44.129
Caption: scenarios has to be sufficient when

00:39:42.989 --> 00:39:46.500
Caption: easy-to-use

00:39:44.129 --> 00:39:49.099
Caption: that&#39;s what using other scenarios has to

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:52.320
Caption: be maintainable code about can be fixing

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:55.950
Caption: continues its product involves and happy

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:57.449
Caption: should be maintained so that you&#39;re not

00:39:55.949 --> 00:39:59.608
Caption: stuck with a normal version forever

00:39:57.449 --> 00:40:01.050
Caption: controls all in Calvin code bases we

00:39:59.608 --> 00:40:04.559
Caption: have an all learners and hibernate

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:06.390
Caption: that&#39;s from client 2008 and it&#39;s an

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.729
Caption: alpha but you can&#39;t change anything that

00:40:06.389 --> 00:40:11.339
Caption: abuse in so many places it&#39;ll be like

00:40:08.729 --> 00:40:14.639
Caption: three months of no value to replace it

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:18.060
Caption: that&#39;s not some situation um so it&#39;s not

00:40:14.639 --> 00:40:22.679
Caption: tough together estimated to naturally on

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:24.060
Caption: top of the petals of an impetus and it

00:40:22.679 --> 00:40:26.479
Caption: was really what about degree well and

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:28.709
Caption: the clients or result tended to be

00:40:26.479 --> 00:40:30.290
Caption: inflexible poorly maintained and

00:40:28.709 --> 00:40:32.280
Caption: generally not worth the effort of using

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:35.250
Caption: inside that&#39;s a pretty shot

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:37.650
Caption: alone so you must take the taxi better

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:39.419
Caption: to copy code between projects than

00:40:37.649 --> 00:40:42.229
Caption: extracted into a third project that

00:40:39.419 --> 00:40:45.510
Caption: everyone&#39;s going to magically maintain

00:40:42.229 --> 00:40:47.669
Caption: that makes me only to and responsibility

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:48.600
Caption: for that code clear and your project you

00:40:47.669 --> 00:40:50.879
Caption: own it you maintain

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:52.200
Caption: if somebody puts in a third party

00:40:50.879 --> 00:40:54.750
Caption: project well that&#39;s practically their

00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:57.209
Caption: comments nobody gives ahead it also

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:58.949
Caption: allows you to extensively customize the

00:40:57.209 --> 00:41:00.330
Caption: code you&#39;ll be using without having to

00:40:58.949 --> 00:41:04.919
Caption: wire that you&#39;re breaking into everybody

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:07.469
Caption: else so I think we&#39;re almost at time so

00:41:04.919 --> 00:41:09.449
Caption: key points practice it back

00:41:07.469 --> 00:41:12.060
Caption: most of my failures involve downplaying

00:41:09.449 --> 00:41:13.770
Caption: or ignoring to feedback from either the

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:16.800
Caption: difficulty of working systems or

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:18.689
Caption: directly from coworkers ensure that

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:21.390
Caption: every element of your architectures and

00:41:18.689 --> 00:41:22.609
Caption: justify selves so as things just because

00:41:21.389 --> 00:41:25.789
Caption: that&#39;s the way you do things

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:28.140
Caption: does largely follow a silo workflow and

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:30.959
Caption: don&#39;t push the sign up it&#39;s on to

00:41:28.139 --> 00:41:34.979
Caption: everything that you do it and learn from

00:41:30.959 --> 00:41:36.689
Caption: the fact is take your ego you can&#39;t look

00:41:34.979 --> 00:41:38.790
Caption: at something you&#39;ve done and suggest

00:41:36.689 --> 00:41:42.079
Caption: ways of doing it better and it&#39;s really

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:42.080
Caption: time to find a new profession

00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:55.290
Caption: [Applause]

00:41:50.969 --> 00:41:55.290
Caption: we might have a couple minutes

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:59.909
Caption: you mentioned uploading your own

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:08.979
Caption: commercial code which thank you PL are

00:42:05.139 --> 00:42:09.939
Caption: consume your images of dollars for

00:42:08.979 --> 00:42:14.770
Caption: certain projects

00:42:09.939 --> 00:42:17.829
Caption: what suggesting is that don&#39;t find

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:20.349
Caption: writing to use reasonably from the

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:22.959
Caption: beginning so if you&#39;re not going to get

00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:25.599
Caption: correctly how they go to use it somebody

00:42:22.959 --> 00:42:27.159
Caption: else in your organization put in their

00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:30.849
Caption: projects that would be useful in yours

00:42:27.159 --> 00:42:33.848
Caption: grab it pull it in you own it now these

00:42:30.849 --> 00:42:35.500
Caption: it turns out that teams you know they&#39;ve

00:42:33.849 --> 00:42:37.300
Caption: evolved in kind of the same way and

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:39.099
Caption: there is actually opportunity to

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:41.500
Caption: consolidate those and you have the

00:42:39.099 --> 00:42:43.210
Caption: structures in place to actually deal

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:45.909
Caption: with that the exciting project and

00:42:43.209 --> 00:42:47.618
Caption: mentor project and maintain it and keep

00:42:45.909 --> 00:42:49.629
Caption: it consistent and it won&#39;t divert

00:42:47.618 --> 00:42:51.939
Caption: through other projects which is a whole

00:42:49.629 --> 00:42:53.799
Caption: bunch of conditions on it then it might

00:42:51.939 --> 00:42:56.098
Caption: be worth doing such but you know a

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:58.540
Caption: number of organizations have created

00:42:56.099 --> 00:43:02.200
Caption: reasonable web libraries in the past and

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:04.810
Caption: generally they don&#39;t go very far and you

00:43:02.199 --> 00:43:06.729
Caption: know I don&#39;t want to make mention

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:08.709
Caption: patents and practices as being terrible

00:43:06.729 --> 00:43:23.010
Caption: people to this they&#39;re not about me but

00:43:08.709 --> 00:43:26.469
Caption: you know let&#39;s just pretend I didn&#39;t um

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:29.080
Caption: I&#39;m a big kind of doing that now

00:43:26.469 --> 00:43:30.669
Caption: obviously you need to make sure you have

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.070
Caption: the appropriate or forest or ization

00:43:30.669 --> 00:43:34.780
Caption: because most people won&#39;t work you can

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:36.280
Caption: self will have a contract in places that

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.320
Caption: everything you own belongs to your

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.750
Caption: employer and putting an apple in hub

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:43.810
Caption: under and as your license might be

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:45.719
Caption: slightly in violation of that a lot of

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:49.000
Caption: organizations are getting better at

00:43:45.719 --> 00:43:51.550
Caption: saying yes we opened ourselves I&#39;ve
