00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:54.519
Caption: in an industry some because they don&#39;t

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:56.380

00:32:21.369 --> 00:32:25.630

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.979

00:32:37.079 --> 00:32:44.229
Caption: ingredients and conversation between you

00:32:39.339 --> 00:32:46.750
Caption: and a number put more pretty badly an

00:32:44.229 --> 00:32:49.660

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:53.469
Caption: coming out for another I was already

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:55.720
Caption: some and so what this particular team

00:32:53.469 --> 00:32:57.280
Caption: did was they started writing some

00:32:55.719 --> 00:32:58.390
Caption: painting tests around so basically we

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.429

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:02.109
Caption: we think we have engineer son rule we

00:33:00.428 --> 00:33:03.669

00:33:02.109 --> 00:33:05.500
Caption: ingredients these combinations to this

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:07.270
Caption: number but we know that if we want to be

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.859

Caption: traditional legacy system in external um

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:21.429

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.390
Caption: just really need out of it and I got

00:33:26.739 --> 00:33:30.339
Caption: some point where tests were actually

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:32.410
Caption: valued in the degree of confidence we

00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:34.449
Caption: can feel good that said I&#39;m marking

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:36.070

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.219

00:37:43.149 --> 00:37:47.229
Caption: expect and if you are part of that team

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:50.020

00:37:47.229 --> 00:37:57.639
Caption: yourself to always try to make things

00:37:50.020 --> 00:38:01.350

00:37:57.639 --> 00:38:04.269

Caption: want to persuade them that they wants to

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:18.250
Caption: work with you which is harder than

00:38:14.199 --> 00:38:20.500
Caption: identifying so relatively easy give you

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:23.579
Caption: a task may be any way to do that is you

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:26.949

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:46.179

00:38:50.949 --> 00:38:54.189
Caption: hope so but here are some things I think

00:38:52.868 --> 00:38:57.639
Caption: I personally could improve on

00:38:54.189 --> 00:39:01.088
Caption: elimination should be attributed to be

00:38:57.639 --> 00:39:03.809
Caption: able to improve on um need to address

00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:06.520
Caption: the non performance kindly considerably

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:08.650

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.719
Caption: them and you need to be seen to address

00:39:08.649 --> 00:39:14.409

Caption: going to wait that feedback according to

00:39:34.929 --> 00:39:41.949
Caption: where it came from that&#39;s probably the

00:39:39.969 --> 00:39:44.108

Caption: together affordable pack that&#39;s a really

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.729
Caption: good question what I would bring it back

00:41:59.639 --> 00:42:05.369
Caption: to is a shared mission if those people

00:42:02.729 --> 00:42:07.409
Caption: believe in I will turn up and I&#39;ll get

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:10.500
Caption: myself down and not have a lot of you

00:42:07.409 --> 00:42:13.709
Caption: the creation prime but if other people

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:15.629
Caption: believe in we are going to turn up we

00:42:13.709 --> 00:42:17.580
Caption: are going to change the world it doesn&#39;t

00:42:15.629 --> 00:42:26.069

Caption: pocket and I just haven&#39;t gotten the

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:34.470
Caption: right in triple imagine if telling up

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:36.900
Caption: there that the people who sorted out me

00:42:34.469 --> 00:42:39.239
Caption: getting on stage you can care about the

00:42:36.899 --> 00:42:41.039
Caption: getting down on beach again this mission

00:42:39.239 --> 00:42:43.320
Caption: is not going to go though so it&#39;s really

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:44.760
Caption: the question you need to part people who

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.520
Caption: believe in what they&#39;re showing

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:49.919
Caption: and they need to help them understand

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:53.100
Caption: that other people also have that same

00:42:49.919 --> 00:42:54.359
Caption:  and you need to get out of it

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.610
Caption: right and that doesn&#39;t mean just

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:59.310
Caption: personally Canada or if that means we&#39;re

00:42:56.610 --> 00:43:01.140
Caption: impediments from having them being a

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:02.640
Caption: collaborative tape if it will complicate

00:43:01.139 --> 00:43:05.189
Caption: we be in choler kata

00:43:02.639 --> 00:43:07.079
Caption: if I don&#39;t have slack will you get some

00:43:05.189 --> 00:43:09.629
Caption: messaging choice tool choice is gonna

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:12.150
Caption: make you still use pickup we know I&#39;m

00:43:09.629 --> 00:43:13.500

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:19.020
Caption: give them the tools to develop trust in

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:20.940
Caption: each other that means things like yo CI

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:22.439
Caption: pipelines to unique online natural

00:43:20.939 --> 00:43:24.510

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:39.390
Caption: lot your mission for today is not to say
