WEBVTT

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:13.789
Caption: Hey hopefully had a good break so I&#39;d

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.850
Caption: like to welcome next sander

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:19.040
Caption: give us a new review of cryptography I&#39;m

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.278
Caption: really looking forward to this top cuz

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.619
Caption: my idea of cryptography was the Enigma

00:00:22.278 --> 00:00:26.569
Caption: machine and Leslie Heath so I&#39;m sure

00:00:24.618 --> 00:00:33.799
Caption: things have changed since then yeah

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:36.619
Caption: please welcome Sandra thank you thank

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:39.349
Caption: you by show of hands how many of you

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:41.779
Caption: have seen the movie 2001 a Space Odyssey

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:43.279
Caption: alright that&#39;s quite a few you&#39;ll

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:45.738
Caption: probably know that one of the main

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:47.090
Caption: characters in the movie is the computer

00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:50.389
Caption: that actually controls the spaceship

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.049
Caption: which is hell and when the movie came

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:56.239
Caption: out people noticed that Hal is actually

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:58.720
Caption: derived from IBM because if you shift

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.600
Caption: the letters from IBM to the left by one

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.459
Caption: you get help but the writer of 2001 a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:07.879
Caption: Space Odyssey said that that was not

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:09.470
Caption: intentional we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:12.078
Caption: but there you go

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.299
Caption: it is it is however a nice example of a

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.100
Caption: very simple encryption method which is

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.280
Caption: called the shift cipher but it&#39;s also

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:20.959
Caption: known as as the Caesar cipher and it

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:23.119
Caption: bears his name because Caesar emperor

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:27.319
Caption: Caesar actually used this encryption

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.940
Caption: method back in the day it is a character

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.548
Caption: substitution method

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.220
Caption: the idea is to shift all the letters in

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.280
Caption: the alphabet by a fixed number of places

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.010
Caption: 1 2 or 3 and anywhere up to 26 and then

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:44.868
Caption: basically you&#39;ve gone around so because

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:48.459
Caption: a C goes to B etc decryption means doing

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.780
Caption: the opposite so a goes back to be etc

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.599
Caption: now you might wonder how this would be

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:55.129
Caption: secure you have to remember that back in

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.559
Caption: the day not a lot of people actually

00:01:55.129 --> 00:02:00.079
Caption: knew how to read or write lesson but all

00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:01.938
Caption: communication would be in Latin so by

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.189
Caption: adding a simple method of encryption

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.539
Caption: Caesar was able to you to create very

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.220
Caption: secure communications and in the case of

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.798
Caption: Caesar we actually use the shift of

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.798
Caption: minus 3 the most well-known form of

00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:21.438
Caption: shifting is probably our T 13 and it has

00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:23.449
Caption: the added benefit of being symmetric so

00:02:21.438 --> 00:02:25.848
Caption: encrypting is basically exactly the same

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:27.020
Caption: thing as decrypting so for instance if

00:02:25.848 --> 00:02:30.139
Caption: you encrypt

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.510
Caption: d it goes to Q but if you encrypt Q it

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:36.740
Caption: goes back to B so it&#39;s in that sense

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:40.339
Caption: it&#39;s symmetric character substitution

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.380
Caption: also forms the basis of the device that

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:44.089
Caption: I will talk about in the rest of my talk

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.900
Caption: which switches briefly mentioned the

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:49.879
Caption: Enigma to German Enigma the Enigma probe

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:51.500
Caption: performs a proper character substitution

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.830
Caption: in the sense that it doesn&#39;t just do a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.320
Caption: shift you type a letter and a certain

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.750
Caption: lamp would light up so for instance you

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.950
Caption: would type the T and it would show up as

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.960
Caption: a king it&#39;s also symmetric in the sense

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:07.669
Caption: that when you use the same key the same

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.100
Caption: settings for the machine if you then

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:13.429
Caption: type the encrypted message you will get

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.460
Caption: the plaintext back so it&#39;s very very

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:18.439
Caption: handy in that sense now I&#39;d like to

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.170
Caption: point out that from an electrical point

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.540
Caption: of view the Enigma machine is incredibly

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:27.559
Caption: simple it basically consists of a

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:31.699
Caption: battery of a switch and a lamp close the

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:33.470
Caption: switch and the lamp will turn on this is

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:36.220
Caption: of course a gross simplification because

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.500
Caption: the actual Enigma used 26 switches and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.229
Caption: 26 lamps and a bit of additional I would

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.740
Caption: call it electronics but wiring to dunya

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:47.779
Caption: encryption it is actually so simple that

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.350
Caption: I was able to build a tiny little

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:53.690
Caption: encryption device like this which uses

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.820
Caption: exactly the same core principle it is

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.580
Caption: extremely limited because it also had it

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.220
Caption: only has four characters and it actually

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.369
Caption: only uses three keys but the principle

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.309
Caption: is exactly the same it shows that the

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:09.110
Caption: character never encodes to itself just

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:11.809
Caption: like the Enigma the only thing that this

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.369
Caption: one doesn&#39;t do is go through all the

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:17.359
Caption: keys which is something that he enigma

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:19.429
Caption: actually does automatically now the

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.709
Caption: smarts of the Enigma are in the way the

00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:24.919
Caption: electrical circuit is closed using those

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.130
Caption: 26 keys and 26 lamps and this is done by

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.020
Caption: a set of rotors and each rotors perform

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.830
Caption: each rotor performs a certain character

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:35.720
Caption: substitution now each enigma m3 had five

00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:39.019
Caption: rotors of of which three would always

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.940
Caption: use at once on top of that it had to

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:43.399
Caption: static wheels and

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.739
Caption: over there and then reflector wheel over

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:48.109
Caption: there and basically the current would

00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:50.179
Caption: flow through the entry wheel through

00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:53.359
Caption: these three rotors back flew through the

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:56.059
Caption: reflector wheel and back again through

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:58.489
Caption: the routers and the entry wheel and then

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.899
Caption: a lamp would light up and I&#39;d also like

00:04:58.489 --> 00:05:03.819
Caption: to point out there&#39;s something else here

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:06.079
Caption: which is the plug board but abacab extra

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.539
Caption: but the power of the enigma was that

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:10.429
Caption: each time you press the key one of the

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.889
Caption: rotors would actually rotate one

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:14.389
Caption: position and at some point that one

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:20.479
Caption: would actually rotate another one as

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:22.160
Caption: well I&#39;ll get back to that assumed so I

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.199
Caption: just briefly mentioned the flood board

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.179
Caption: this was only used for the military

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.970
Caption: enigma there were also a next month

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:31.399
Caption: enigma is used for postal service&#39;s way

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.079
Caption: before the war but this wasn&#39;t this was

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:36.739
Caption: an addition that actually made it much

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:38.209
Caption: more difficult to to crack and the

00:05:36.739 --> 00:05:40.759
Caption: plugboard perform two additional

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:42.369
Caption: substitutions one on the way in and one

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:45.529
Caption: on the way out

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:47.779
Caption: so the roses would step a base on the

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:50.720
Caption: key presses and just like a plane or

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:53.329
Caption: odometer that you would find in a car at

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.399
Caption: some point a router on the right would

00:05:53.329 --> 00:06:00.259
Caption: basically make the router to its left

00:05:55.399 --> 00:06:03.259
Caption: also step forward one step and again for

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.490
Caption: the router next to that and what happens

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.559
Caption: is that the actual character

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:08.959
Caption: substitution of the machine changes

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:11.658
Caption: every time you press the key and this

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:14.299
Caption: means that when you press two keys to

00:06:11.658 --> 00:06:16.309
Caption: two times Genki you will not get the

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:18.918
Caption: same result so you press t1 so you might

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:25.459
Caption: get K you press T again you might get

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:27.199
Caption: repeat for instance and they are what

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:30.019
Caption: makes is very strong is that because you

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.459
Caption: you cannot sort of correlate the input

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:33.529
Caption: with the output it makes frequency

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:35.598
Caption: analysis very difficult so for instance

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:37.419
Caption: the letter e it&#39;s very common in the

00:06:35.598 --> 00:06:40.098
Caption: English language and if you could find a

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:41.990
Caption: letter that&#39;s basically in the encrypted

00:06:40.098 --> 00:06:44.209
Caption: message this is often you could infer

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:47.168
Caption: that it might be the letter e so that

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:47.169
Caption: doesn&#39;t work in this case

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:53.690
Caption: now each day the Enigma would be set up

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.149
Caption: by using predefined routers so three

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.360
Caption: inkay

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:59.790
Caption: of m3 in a predefined position one of 26

00:06:57.359 --> 00:07:01.829
Caption: and the predefined ring Stella and the

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:05.070
Caption: ring sterling basically meant how the

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:06.929
Caption: next router would turn over on top of

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.619
Caption: that there was of course the blackboard

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:12.630
Caption: setting and the Germans always used 10

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:15.239
Caption: substitutions always but in other words

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:19.739
Caption: the key for the day was determined by

00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:22.679
Caption: those 4 settings now I&#39;d like to talk a

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:24.660
Caption: little bit about key space and key space

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:27.199
Caption: according to Wikipedia refers to the set

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.940
Caption: of all possible permutations of a key

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:33.630
Caption: now remember the shift cipher it only

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:36.029
Caption: has a key space of 26 this one only has

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:39.690
Caption: a key space of 3 is with remorseless

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:41.970
Caption: reading so if the Allies forces would

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.130
Caption: not have had any knowledge of the rotors

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:46.019
Caption: internals then the key space would have

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.540
Caption: been enormous because just think about

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:51.750
Caption: how many ways you could wire up a single

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.910
Caption: rotor in fact it&#39;s about 1.5 times 2 to

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:58.320
Caption: the power of 20 10 to the power of 25

00:07:53.910 --> 00:08:00.149
Caption: it&#39;s ridiculous but the a large force is

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.460
Caption: that he knew how the rotors were were

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:04.199
Caption: wired but the good thing for the Allied

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:06.299
Caption: forces was that the Germans didn&#39;t know

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.740
Caption: that the Allied forces knew this so they

00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:12.809
Caption: overestimated the power of their Enigma

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:15.239
Caption: so I&#39;d like to point out this guy it&#39;s a

00:08:12.809 --> 00:08:17.549
Caption: Dutch guy his name is karakov and he

00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:20.160
Caption: came up with a principle that said a

00:08:17.549 --> 00:08:22.289
Caption: cryptosystem should be secure even if

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.190
Caption: everything about the system except the

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:28.440
Caption: key is public knowledge so this is why

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.480
Caption: modern cryptographic methods are always

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.700
Caption: publicly scrutinized there is very

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.880
Caption: little to no safety in security through

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.460
Caption: obscurity but the Germans may have

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.229
Caption: overestimated the security of the Enigma

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.970
Caption: by sort of ignoring this law they should

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:43.709
Caption: have assumed that the Allied forces had

00:08:41.969 --> 00:08:47.389
Caption: everything about the Enigma accepted

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:50.550
Caption: please let&#39;s do a quick calculation

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:52.290
Caption: about em three key specs so we have to

00:08:50.549 --> 00:08:54.500
Caption: pick three out of five rotors that gives

00:08:52.289 --> 00:08:58.079
Caption: us a total of 60 combinations each

00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:04.229
Caption: router has 26 positions so that gives us

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:05.610
Caption: 26 to the power 3 equals 17,500 176 then

00:09:04.229 --> 00:09:06.859
Caption: we have to bring Stalin which only

00:09:05.609 --> 00:09:10.489
Caption: applies to two of the

00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:13.279
Caption: which gives us another 676 combinations

00:09:10.489 --> 00:09:16.070
Caption: but now it gets wild because when we

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.550
Caption: factor in the plugboard which always had

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:24.229
Caption: 10 substitutions we get a whopping 1.5

00:09:19.549 --> 00:09:26.000
Caption: times 10 to the power 14 permutations so

00:09:24.229 --> 00:09:27.979
Caption: we have to multiply these together and

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.590
Caption: then we get the total key space of the

00:09:27.979 --> 00:09:33.260
Caption: m3 which is about one point zero seven

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:35.690
Caption: times ten to the power 23 which equates

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:40.070
Caption: to approximately 77 bits which is pretty

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:42.200
Caption: good for you know for that time and

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.770
Caption: because he m4 used three routers out of

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.630
Caption: eight plus a force one it was actually a

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:51.440
Caption: 291 times stronger so it had a key space

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:53.059
Caption: without 84 bits now let&#39;s do a quick

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.729
Caption: recap so far we&#39;ve talked about

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:57.349
Caption: encryption and decryption character

00:09:55.729 --> 00:10:00.380
Caption: substitution and the shift cipher

00:09:57.349 --> 00:10:04.909
Caption: frequency analysis key space security

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:06.380
Caption: through obscurity and character flaw now

00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:09.199
Caption: let&#39;s talk a little bit about cracking

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.669
Caption: the Enigma how many of you by show of

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.830
Caption: hands have seen the movie the imitation

00:10:10.669 --> 00:10:14.320
Caption: game with Benedict Cumberbatch wow

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.390
Caption: that&#39;s impressive

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:21.679
Caption: so this movie basically revolves around

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:24.080
Caption: Alan Turing and he played a pivotal role

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:25.820
Caption: in cracking the Enigma and most of the

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.650
Caption: work of maybe all of the work that was

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.380
Caption: done to do this was done at Bletchley

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:32.000
Caption: Park in the UK and chewing was one of

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.390
Caption: the first people to be recruited there

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.630
Caption: I&#39;ll get back to him a little bit later

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:40.040
Caption: because there is nothing easier than

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:42.859
Caption: cracking an encryption system then

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:44.869
Caption: having the keys and the Allied forces

00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:47.299
Caption: were lucky enough to have the keys once

00:10:44.869 --> 00:10:49.520
Caption: or twice then got the codebook somehow

00:10:47.299 --> 00:10:51.200
Caption: from the Germans so that gave them the

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.690
Caption: opportunity to actually decrypt the

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.429
Caption: messages that were sent and the good

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.890
Caption: thing was that it gave them information

00:10:55.429 --> 00:10:59.779
Caption: about what are the Germans actually

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.369
Caption: sending or what kind of messages are

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.750
Caption: they sending and can we maybe use that

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:06.409
Caption: later on and it turns out that they

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:10.940
Caption: could and one day God&#39;s hand of the keys

00:11:06.409 --> 00:11:13.039
Caption: that was called a pinch now I would like

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.869
Caption: to point out a flaw in the design of

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:18.049
Caption: enigma and this is called a double step

00:11:14.869 --> 00:11:19.729
Caption: so each time the rightmost at some point

00:11:18.049 --> 00:11:20.519
Caption: when the rightmost wrote it turns out it

00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:22.859
Caption: would also turn

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.179
Caption: the one to its left and at some point it

00:11:22.859 --> 00:11:26.579
Caption: would also turn off the bunch of its

00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:28.169
Caption: left but due to our fault in the

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.820
Caption: mechanical design at some point the

00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:32.820
Caption: middle road to the Sheep turn off twice

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:35.700
Caption: and as a result this would have the key

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.950
Caption: space what this would still leave plenty

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.739
Caption: enough room to not make it completely

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.660
Caption: crackable just like that so it wasn&#39;t

00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:48.450
Caption: that big a deal but it did also help a

00:11:42.659 --> 00:11:50.489
Caption: little bit in statistical analysis the

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.890
Caption: electrical design however also contained

00:11:50.489 --> 00:11:54.359
Caption: a bit of a flaw and that was which also

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.270
Caption: mentioned about this device is that a

00:11:54.359 --> 00:11:59.219
Caption: character never encodes onto itself so a

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:02.630
Caption: tee would never encode him to a tee and

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:05.159
Caption: the Y would never encode them to a Y etc

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.750
Caption: so as a war raged on the code breakers

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:09.569
Caption: get more and more knowledge of the

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.890
Caption: messages that were actually sent so for

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.260
Caption: instance they found patterns in the

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.970
Caption: messages in the original messages so a

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:19.410
Caption: lot of the messages would actually end

00:12:14.969 --> 00:12:21.149
Caption: with how Hitler so these kinds of known

00:12:19.409 --> 00:12:23.940
Caption: texts or soon known texts they were

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:26.430
Caption: called cribs and the Germans actually

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:30.570
Caption: sent a wedding report every day at 6

00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:32.399
Caption: a.m. it had a very specific format so

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.320
Caption: let&#39;s take for example the crib better

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.350
Caption: Burak which means weather report in

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:40.650
Caption: German so if an encrypted text looks

00:12:37.349 --> 00:12:43.589
Caption: like this then you can infer that

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:46.230
Caption: certain places would not be the

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.960
Caption: encrypted words crib that was there

00:12:46.229 --> 00:12:51.389
Caption: because in this case the eye matches but

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:54.450
Caption: the I can never encrypt itself so this

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:59.340
Caption: would be a wrong position to start to

00:12:54.450 --> 00:13:01.470
Caption: start checking now Alan Turing let&#39;s get

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.780
Caption: back to him for a bit he came up with a

00:13:01.469 --> 00:13:05.669
Caption: critter analytic process called member

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:09.450
Caption: isthmus and this was specifically

00:13:05.669 --> 00:13:11.519
Caption: created for German types of messages for

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.049
Caption: sorry German Navy types of messages

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.170
Caption: because of the process they used for

00:13:13.049 --> 00:13:18.059
Caption: encryption so first of all all messages

00:13:16.169 --> 00:13:19.529
Caption: for a single day used the same key which

00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:21.710
Caption: were those for settings I told you about

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:24.120
Caption: earlier this was called a goon Stalin

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:28.590
Caption: but the actual message would be

00:13:24.119 --> 00:13:31.979
Caption: encrypted using a Ken grouper or sort of

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:33.650
Caption: an indicator which was sent twice at the

00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:36.029
Caption: beginning of each

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:39.450
Caption: now all those can group and would be

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:42.120
Caption: sent with the same method same key for a

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:44.730
Caption: single day now this a process of bambor

00:13:42.119 --> 00:13:46.979
Caption: isthmus considers whether encrypted

00:13:44.729 --> 00:13:49.469
Caption: messages are in depth which is sort of a

00:13:46.979 --> 00:13:51.659
Caption: measure of correlation because all those

00:13:49.469 --> 00:13:54.059
Caption: can group and/or indicators were

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:56.069
Caption: encrypted with the same settings they

00:13:54.059 --> 00:13:58.710
Caption: were all in depth and it&#39;s really helped

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:00.479
Caption: with getting information about the

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.940
Caption: settings further for the Enigma for a

00:14:00.479 --> 00:14:04.829
Caption: certain day at the end I&#39;ll have a slide

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:07.409
Caption: with some resources and there&#39;s also a

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:09.090
Caption: link to a site that has like really

00:14:07.409 --> 00:14:13.649
Caption: in-depth information about this process

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:15.690
Caption: in case you are interested in it now

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.360
Caption: Alan Turing also understood that the

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:22.440
Caption: only way to break enigma every single

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:24.390
Caption: day was to automate the process so they

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.460
Caption: built a machine called the bombe which

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:28.920
Caption: is basically named after polish device

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:32.190
Caption: that was used to crack earlier Enigma

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:37.859
Caption: machines so the bomb basically used a

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:40.080
Caption: method of elimination it it tries to it

00:14:37.859 --> 00:14:42.179
Caption: basically parallel parallel eyes going

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.200
Caption: through all the router settings so what

00:14:42.179 --> 00:14:45.929
Caption: you&#39;re looking at is basically a

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.609
Caption: parallel computer in a sense and what it

00:14:45.929 --> 00:14:49.859
Caption: does is trying to juice the plugboard

00:14:47.609 --> 00:14:53.729
Caption: settings that&#39;s the one that actually

00:14:49.859 --> 00:14:55.049
Caption: caved in a comet&#39;s power and it is

00:14:53.729 --> 00:14:58.440
Caption: electrically which made it really really

00:14:55.049 --> 00:15:00.059
Caption: fast and it would start by assuming a

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.369
Caption: certain blackboard setting like for

00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:05.039
Caption: instance a goes to G and then based on

00:15:02.369 --> 00:15:06.390
Caption: the message that it was fent as fat it

00:15:05.039 --> 00:15:09.659
Caption: would then trying to juice other

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:11.549
Caption: settings like H goes to R or Peters o

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:14.959
Caption: until it founds the contradiction

00:15:11.549 --> 00:15:18.510
Caption: for instance a goes to I don&#39;t know yet

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.610
Caption: you can&#39;t have a go to to two characters

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:22.679
Caption: that that&#39;s not how it works we already

00:15:20.609 --> 00:15:24.619
Caption: know that so when you found that

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:27.809
Caption: contradiction you knew it was wrong but

00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:29.520
Caption: Alan Turing understood that all the

00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:31.859
Caption: other plug board settings that you would

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.270
Caption: find in that particular one that they

00:15:31.859 --> 00:15:35.809
Caption: were also wrong and you didn&#39;t have to

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.809
Caption: check them

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.750
Caption: now there is another video sync receipt

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.840
Caption: of the enigma that makes cracking a

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:45.070
Caption: little bit easier so you know how you

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.530
Caption: know how all the roads is basically

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:50.080
Caption: advanced based on the rotor before but

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:52.510
Caption: the leftmost rotor hardly ever rotates

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:55.330
Caption: especially because messages were almost

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:58.419
Caption: never longer than about 650 characters

00:15:55.330 --> 00:16:02.920
Caption: so you could learn quite a lot by just

00:15:58.419 --> 00:16:04.959
Caption: focusing on the right two rotors I&#39;d

00:16:02.919 --> 00:16:06.729
Caption: like to think that the bomb they very

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:10.929
Caption: well have been the first special-purpose

00:16:06.729 --> 00:16:13.449
Caption: computer ever and it was based on much

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:17.559
Caption: of chewings ideas about computing and

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:19.119
Caption: algorithms and things like that the

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:21.159
Caption: entire effort of the crips in an enigma

00:16:19.119 --> 00:16:23.409
Caption: was an incredible feat of human

00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:28.119
Caption: ingenuity and it was based in science

00:16:23.409 --> 00:16:29.379
Caption: engineering math and statistics now

00:16:28.119 --> 00:16:32.229
Caption: there&#39;s a lot more to be said about

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.630
Caption: Ehlinger think for instance about the

00:16:32.229 --> 00:16:36.130
Caption: Turing machine or the Turing test

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:39.700
Caption: there&#39;s also a lot more to be said about

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:41.140
Caption: the Enigma itself but the purpose of my

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.380
Caption: talk was not to give you like a

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:47.679
Caption: comprehensive overview of the Enigma in

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:50.530
Caption: the efforts of cracking in or about

00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:52.359
Caption: curing I did however address some

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:54.730
Caption: concepts of cryptography that you might

00:16:52.359 --> 00:16:57.000
Caption: want to further study so I do encourage

00:16:54.729 --> 00:16:59.769
Caption: you to find out more about Alan Turing

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.539
Caption: about the Turing machine the gaming man

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.840
Caption: and about cryptography as a field of

00:17:01.539 --> 00:17:06.369
Caption: study we&#39;ve come a long way since

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:09.940
Caption: Cynthia enigma even though for the time

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:11.530
Caption: it was a really good machine so I have a

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:14.379
Caption: look at the list of resources which I&#39;ll

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:16.150
