  "description": "Building apps that work offline can be difficult, but a reframing from \u201Coffline mode\u201D to \u201Coffline-first\u201D might be all you need to do to simplify those problems. If you start with an offline-first approach, not only do you have offline mode, but your users will have a better experience to boot.\\n\\nThis talk will run through building an offline-first application and the slightly different challenges \u2014 but also the benefits \u2014 that come with it.\\n\\nNo experience necessary\\n45 mins\\nFrontend Development\\nBen is a software developer at Telstra Purple, which gives him the opportunity to work to help a number of teams solve their business problems. He mostly works in web development, using TypeScript and React, but is interested in all aspects of web development. He loves to share his excitement with those around him, and that\u0027s what he\u0027s here to do today!"
