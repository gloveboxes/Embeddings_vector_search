WEBVTT

00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:03.418
Caption: uh and today I want to talk about well

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.219
Caption: I&#39;m calling it secrets of the credential

00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:07.340
Caption: management apis now has anybody heard of

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:10.379
Caption: the credential management apis before

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.000
Caption: that&#39;s one two three okay so that&#39;s

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.280
Caption: actually that&#39;s five is more than

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.079
Caption: normally put it up for those of but for

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.059
Caption: the rest of you uh I I guess it&#39;s not so

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.858
Caption: much secrets of these apis but the apis

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:22.739
Caption: have been sort of kept a secret from you

00:00:19.858 --> 00:00:25.018
Caption: uh a little bit uh and um and we&#39;ll

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.518
Caption: we&#39;ll dig into a bit of that uh soon now

00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:28.018
Caption: I also realized this is a 20 minute talk

00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:29.340
Caption: I might talk a little fast because uh

00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:31.379
Caption: the last time I gave this this was about

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.119
Caption: half an hour so let&#39;s crack on with it

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.860
Caption: uh my name is philanash I am a developer

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:36.119
Caption: advantages at a company called twilio if

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.219
Caption: you want to learn about twilio or talk

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.898
Caption: to me again later I have a booth on the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.879
Caption: other side there uh opposite the coffee

00:00:39.898 --> 00:00:44.218
Caption: stand so come say hi to me there or

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.659
Caption: catch me online I am Phil Nash all over

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.760
Caption: the Internet uh Twitter LinkedIn

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.860
Caption: whatever or hit me up on email

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:53.459
Caption: filmyashatoyo.com

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.379
Caption: um I have a question already yeah

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:57.840
Caption: I love it right

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.059
Caption: uh I will pay anything to have my domain

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.799
Caption: name like that also some film Nash has

00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:04.139
Caption: got filmnash.com and is holding on to it

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.298
Caption: and doing nothing with it anymore so but

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:07.978
Caption: this is better this is better

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.119
Caption: um cool so what I want to kind of talk

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:11.938
Caption: about is like better authentication

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.340
Caption: experiences I have this concern that uh

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.960
Caption: when we build applications on the web uh

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:18.478
Caption: that uh the important and interesting

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.500
Caption: things that we work on are you know

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.059
Caption: um the applications are actually

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.040
Caption: building that that thing beyond the

00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:24.478
Caption: login experience the thing that users

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.159
Caption: actually want to get to and that login

00:01:24.478 --> 00:01:28.019
Caption: tends to be

00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:30.118
Caption: um a friction the thing that goes in the

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:33.298
Caption: way of of people getting to do the stuff

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.299
Caption: uh that they actually uh care about uh

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.700
Caption: and I want to improve that because

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.180
Caption: so I was looking at some data a while

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:43.319
Caption: back and um this 24 number comes from a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.139
Caption: survey that Google did at the end of

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.239
Caption: 2018 uh about kind of security uh things

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:50.099
Caption: that users do and 24 was the number of

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.739
Caption: people who use a password manager uh

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.000
Caption: from that uh survey uh 24 not bad

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:55.199
Caption: actually pretty good number but that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.059
Caption: still means three quarters of people are

00:01:55.199 --> 00:02:00.059
Caption: not using a password manager which sort

00:01:57.059 --> 00:02:02.040
Caption: of is bad because because passwords

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:03.898
Caption: right in fact

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.040
Caption: um and and I do want to kind of prefix

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.719
Caption: this by the fact that you know we&#39;re

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.179
Caption: probably developers or power users of

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.039
Caption: computers and our laptops uh in our

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.080
Caption: daily work and we probably are amongst

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.639
Caption: those 24 that do use a password manager

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.339
Caption: or in fact have

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:19.199
Caption: um uh it worked on your own login

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:20.220
Caption: experience so that you don&#39;t have to

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:21.238
Caption: worry about that it&#39;s normally a click

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.040
Caption: you don&#39;t have to know your own password

00:02:21.238 --> 00:02:24.958
Caption: but that&#39;s not the case for most people

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.159
Caption: and that&#39;s my point here

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.800
Caption: um

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.480
Caption: this uh awkward sort of uh flow diagram

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.458
Caption: kind of is is the experience of somebody

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.598
Caption: logging into a website right and it

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:35.699
Caption: starts at the top where you hit the

00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:38.339
Caption: login page right there and immediately

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:39.539
Caption: you asked yourself do I know my username

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.979
Caption: um because that&#39;s not necessarily clear

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:42.238
Caption: now sometimes it&#39;s your email sometimes

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:43.139
Caption: it&#39;s something else and if you don&#39;t you

00:02:42.238 --> 00:02:45.839
Caption: have to go through a nice little

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:48.300
Caption: username reflex um uh username reset

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:50.279
Caption: password flow uh if you&#39;ve got past the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.319
Caption: uh like username like if the answer to

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.458
Caption: this is yes and or indeed maybe uh

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.080
Caption: because you can never tell until you&#39;ve

00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:56.699
Caption: put it in and we get to do I know my

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.958
Caption: password and again that&#39;s the same

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.220
Caption: problem maybe you do maybe you don&#39;t if

00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.319
Caption: you&#39;ve got it in a pass Advantage you&#39;re

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.580
Caption: probably fine but if you are not if

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.639
Caption: you&#39;re a regular user if you&#39;re one of

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.378
Caption: the 74 of 76 of people not using one do

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.419
Caption: you know your password who knows maybe

00:03:07.378 --> 00:03:10.738
Caption: you have to go through a reset flow if

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.479
Caption: you think you know both of those you can

00:03:10.738 --> 00:03:13.679
Caption: enter them in and hope for the best at

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.119
Caption: which point you find out whether you

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:16.919
Caption: knew your email address sorry your

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.360
Caption: username and password and either go back

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.518
Caption: to the start and maybe go through one of

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.958
Caption: the reset flows again or you get on and

00:03:20.518 --> 00:03:24.059
Caption: maybe hit a two-fact authentication

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.738
Caption: challenge because it&#39;s a secure site and

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:27.059
Caption: uh and then a text message is sent to

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:28.679
Caption: your phone your phone another room you

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:30.899
Caption: give up you close the computer you throw

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:32.639
Caption: it out the window

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:34.799
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s a sort of regular user

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.399
Caption: flow of logging into a website

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.720
Caption: um

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:38.279
Caption: that&#39;s the two-factor then you get your

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.220
Caption: message right yeah sure the user

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:43.440
Caption: experience of this uh ends up being

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.360
Caption: um I I have a scale of like zero to poop

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.180
Caption: emoji on this and it&#39;s just poop emoji

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.619
Caption: that&#39;s uh this is not a scientific scale

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:50.819
Caption: it&#39;s just how I like to think about

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:53.339
Caption: things

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.899
Caption: um it&#39;s bad user experience and we can

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.220
Caption: make it better

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:57.238
Caption: um because it&#39;s full of friction that&#39;s

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.798
Caption: what I&#39;m kind of talking about it&#39;s full

00:03:57.238 --> 00:04:01.319
Caption: of that like do I know my username do I

00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:03.539
Caption: know my password am I right about either

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.738
Caption: of those uh and and how long does it

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.298
Caption: take to actually get to the thing we

00:04:04.738 --> 00:04:08.000
Caption: wanted to do in the first place do we

00:04:06.298 --> 00:04:11.039
Caption: want to buy the thing do we want to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.119
Caption: carry on the service whatever so I&#39;m

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.798
Caption: gonna run us through how we can do

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:16.139
Caption: usernames and passwords better real

00:04:13.798 --> 00:04:17.820
Caption: quick I&#39;m going to start with the HTML

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.619
Caption: um HTML can actually help us an awful

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.299
Caption: lot in this place it makes the form more

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:23.279
Caption: accessible it makes the experience

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.259
Caption: better and quicker

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.880
Caption: um and so this is what a login form

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.619
Caption: might look like right we&#39;ve got a fairly

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.479
Caption: straightforward form it&#39;s got two inputs

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:32.459
Caption: uh uh

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.559
Caption: a text input for our username a password

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:36.479
Caption: input from our password the labels point

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:38.100
Caption: to the right things it&#39;s fine it&#39;s quite

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.979
Caption: good but there&#39;s more we can do to it

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.500
Caption: than this the input element itself is

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.019
Caption: one of my favorite elements in HTML

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.419
Caption: possibly my favorite because

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:50.039
Caption: um because of how much uh scope it has

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.600
Caption: the the amount of things you can do with

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.860
Caption: a single attribute that changes the

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.119
Caption: behavior of an input element is

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:56.638
Caption: incredible

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:59.279
Caption: um the attributes available to us some

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.479
Caption: are less used than others and the ones I

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.519
Caption: want to kind of call out here well

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.320
Caption: firstly uh the type you might be able to

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:05.879
Caption: change an input a month to a checkbox or

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.740
Caption: a radio button or something but in this

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.179
Caption: particular case if my form was if my

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:10.679
Caption: username was in fact an email address as

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:13.079
Caption: well then we probably should change that

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:14.519
Caption: type to an email that&#39;s going to help us

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:18.179
Caption: on a mobile device it&#39;s going to pop up

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:19.619
Caption: uh the keyboard which has an app symbol

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:21.839
Caption: like prominently on it which is useful

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:23.639
Caption: and helps people out and then we&#39;ve got

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.019
Caption: autocomplete autocomplete is going to

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.399
Caption: feature quite a bit in this because it&#39;s

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:29.579
Caption: the greatest attribute the input element

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:30.720
Caption: has uh in this case uh autocomplete

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:32.698
Caption: username and autocomplete current

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.380
Caption: password allow us to give hints to the

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.539
Caption: browser and indeed to any other

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.100
Caption: technology like a password manager that

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.360
Caption: might want to auto fill these things in

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.959
Caption: for you

00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:41.758
Caption: um

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:43.319
Caption: username is really useful there is also

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.360
Caption: order complete email but that&#39;s really

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.460
Caption: for when you&#39;re um dealing with

00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:49.079
Caption: somebody&#39;s actual contact details not

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:50.519
Caption: the thing you&#39;re using to log into a

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:52.799
Caption: thing

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:54.319
Caption: um current password is really cool uh

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:56.638
Caption: because there&#39;s also a new password

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.020
Caption: autocomplete uh that&#39;s particularly

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.279
Caption: useful for your page where you&#39;re

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:00.720
Caption: changing your password and you have

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.759
Caption: three different password inputs on the

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.279
Caption: same page one&#39;s for the old password and

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.959
Caption: two are for repeating the new password

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:11.220
Caption: um but without new password and current

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:13.440
Caption: password uh browsers or

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.880
Caption: password managers will auto fill the

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.019
Caption: same thing into all three but if you

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.699
Caption: have new password and current password

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:19.319
Caption: then they&#39;ll be able to offer

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.339
Caption: suggestions to the new password and the

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.279
Caption: existing one to the current password

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:24.839
Caption: actually Firefox itself offers you a

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:27.239
Caption: secure suggestion if you have

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:28.739
Caption: autocomplete&#39;s new password on an input

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:29.638
Caption: really useful

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:31.918
Caption: um certificate about these order

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.119
Caption: complete look it up it&#39;s amazing I have

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.679
Caption: a little demo of just kind of my

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.819
Caption: existing login flow I&#39;ve got a demo

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:37.619
Caption: application that we&#39;re going to deal

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.419
Caption: with for the rest of this app and all it

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:42.359
Caption: does is Log In which is annoying really

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.800
Caption: because the entire app is 100 friction

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:45.599
Caption: um but this

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:47.879
Caption: it&#39;s got nothing on the other side of it

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.959
Caption: it&#39;s amazing it&#39;s got a log out button

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.600
Caption: um but I just want to show you like this

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:52.919
Caption: is the existing experience right we we

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.539
Caption: go to log in we have to do all the

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:56.399
Caption: typing I happen to know my username and

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.959
Caption: password for this uh the password is

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:59.699
Caption: Secret

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.679
Caption: it&#39;s the most secure six character

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:03.539
Caption: password I can think of uh and I&#39;m

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:04.739
Caption: logged in uh in fact I&#39;ve got a two-fact

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.239
Caption: authentication message and there it is

00:07:04.739 --> 00:07:07.220
Caption: over the other side

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:10.380
Caption: um

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.059
Caption: 843293 cool uh so I had to look at my

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.940
Caption: phone and then I come back over here and

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:16.679
Caption: oh my goodness it was yeah

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.639
Caption: are we logged in yet yes we&#39;re logged in

00:07:16.679 --> 00:07:18.839
Caption: cool

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.580
Caption: um go away

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.899
Caption: I&#39;ll come back to that later

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:23.579
Caption: um so that&#39;s that&#39;s the sort of that&#39;s

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:26.098
Caption: our existing slow I have to type

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:27.720
Caption: everything in version so let&#39;s see what

00:07:26.098 --> 00:07:28.859
Caption: else we can do um that had our

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.819
Caption: autocomplete attributes on it but

00:07:28.859 --> 00:07:31.500
Caption: because I wasn&#39;t using any other

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:33.179
Caption: technology to auto complete things it

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.559
Caption: didn&#39;t show up to help

00:07:33.179 --> 00:07:36.000
Caption: but this is where we get to credential

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:37.799
Caption: management and for the people who put

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.119
Caption: their uh hands up they know about this

00:07:37.799 --> 00:07:40.799
Caption: is great

00:07:39.119 --> 00:07:42.179
Caption: um credential Management apis in the

00:07:40.799 --> 00:07:45.059
Caption: browsers allow us to store and then

00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:47.098
Caption: retrieve our users credentials

00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:48.959
Caption: um and so I was annoyingly clicking away

00:07:47.098 --> 00:07:50.098
Caption: the browser pop-up there to say I would

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:52.019
Caption: like to would you like to save your

00:07:50.098 --> 00:07:53.039
Caption: username and password in this uh but

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:54.539
Caption: that was just kind of the browser doing

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:57.179
Caption: on its own what we can actually hook

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:59.699
Caption: into is is triggering that and then

00:07:57.179 --> 00:08:01.440
Caption: using it later because if we as a

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:04.380
Caption: developer as the website trigger that

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.479
Caption: app um that pop-up we&#39;re actually able

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.520
Caption: to retrieve the password from the

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:10.199
Caption: username and password from it later and

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:12.000
Caption: make a smoother login flow and I&#39;ll show

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:13.139
Caption: you how that works

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.940
Caption: um here&#39;s what the code looks like it&#39;s

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:17.039
Caption: actually fairly simple

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.899
Caption: uh we look for the password credential

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:20.339
Caption: to be in the window object and when we

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:22.799
Caption: have that we can create a password

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:25.500
Caption: credential using our user ID and

00:08:22.799 --> 00:08:27.179
Caption: password so this is once we know uh that

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.160
Caption: the user ID and password is correct so

00:08:27.179 --> 00:08:30.899
Caption: this could happen at registration or on

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.700
Caption: a successful login

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:34.260
Caption: and uh and once we create that

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.059
Caption: credential

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.979
Caption: um oh no I&#39;ve got things there there we

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:41.039
Caption: go this line a weight Navigator

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:42.239
Caption: credentials store credential allows you

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.338
Caption: to then

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:45.479
Caption: store in the uh in the browser&#39;s

00:08:44.338 --> 00:08:48.059
Caption: credential management the browser&#39;s

00:08:45.479 --> 00:08:49.799
Caption: password manager and the real power of

00:08:48.059 --> 00:08:51.539
Caption: this is the next page where we get to

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:53.700
Caption: ask for it back again so when the user

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:55.259
Caption: comes to log in we can go and retrieve

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.778
Caption: those credentials we say navigator

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.398
Caption: credentials get uh password is true

00:08:57.778 --> 00:09:01.859
Caption: we&#39;re asking for password in this case

00:08:59.398 --> 00:09:04.018
Caption: and that pops up another

00:09:01.859 --> 00:09:05.880
Caption: um permissions thing from the browser to

00:09:04.018 --> 00:09:08.880
Caption: say uh do you want to log in with these

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:11.760
Caption: credentials uh and and if the user

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.278
Caption: approves that then they are through you

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.239
Caption: can write a function that says that pass

00:09:14.278 --> 00:09:16.919
Caption: them through

00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:18.599
Caption: you can actually do this silently as

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:20.398
Caption: well which is which is kind of cool I&#39;m

00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:23.880
Caption: not necessarily the biggest fan of it

00:09:20.398 --> 00:09:26.039
Caption: but uh if um uh you can kind of do that

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.479
Caption: without the permissions dialogue and uh

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:28.799
Caption: and that will pass a user straight

00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:30.599
Caption: through

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:31.679
Caption: um or you know get the credentials for

00:09:30.599 --> 00:09:33.898
Caption: them and allow you to log them straight

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:35.880
Caption: in no friction whatsoever I think maybe

00:09:33.898 --> 00:09:36.838
Caption: a little bit of friction is useful and

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.239
Caption: so but you can turn that on with

00:09:36.838 --> 00:09:40.859
Caption: unmediated as true here

00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:43.260
Caption: um but you can make sure that

00:09:40.859 --> 00:09:45.479
Caption: permissions always pop up if say a user

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.979
Caption: has specifically logged out uh and so

00:09:45.479 --> 00:09:50.639
Caption: when signing out if you call a navigator

00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:52.320
Caption: credentials um prevent silent access uh

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.519
Caption: that&#39;s a good thing for you know a user

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.220
Caption: property sign out they don&#39;t want to be

00:09:53.518 --> 00:09:57.958
Caption: automatically signed in again

00:09:56.219 --> 00:09:59.458
Caption: um what does this look like I think it&#39;s

00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.838
Caption: it&#39;s important to show kind of better

00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:02.398
Caption: what this looks like so if I go and log

00:10:00.838 --> 00:10:04.859
Caption: out I&#39;m going to go back through my

00:10:02.398 --> 00:10:07.380
Caption: process well one second I need to

00:10:04.859 --> 00:10:10.079
Caption: check out the version of the code

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.220
Caption: that does this

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.860
Caption: credential management there you go

00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:15.119
Caption: basically just uncommented a bunch of

00:10:13.859 --> 00:10:17.159
Caption: stuff

00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:18.299
Caption: um and now if I go and log in this time

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:20.458
Caption: around we&#39;re going to see that same

00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:22.140
Caption: browser pop up uh to say hey do you want

00:10:20.458 --> 00:10:25.018
Caption: to store your username and password but

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:28.260
Caption: this time I&#39;m asking for that access

00:10:25.018 --> 00:10:30.599
Caption: and I will be able to use it again later

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.458
Caption: so we&#39;re going to log in we know it&#39;s

00:10:30.599 --> 00:10:34.199
Caption: successful login because we we&#39;ve

00:10:32.458 --> 00:10:35.338
Caption: succeeded I&#39;m saving it I&#39;ve got to go

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.720
Caption: to my two Factor authentication we&#39;ll

00:10:35.338 --> 00:10:38.039
Caption: cover making that better in a second

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:40.619
Caption: seven

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:42.719
Caption: no three four three four

00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:43.919
Caption: and submit that and then through now

00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:46.939
Caption: this time I&#39;m going to log out log back

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:46.940
Caption: in again and we see it work

00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:52.338
Caption: what is it

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:56.700
Caption: friction exactly well it doesn&#39;t help if

00:10:55.018 --> 00:10:59.639
Caption: I&#39;m logging in and out a bunch of times

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:02.239
Caption: but uh it is that or I didn&#39;t do the

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.239
Caption: right typing

00:11:03.359 --> 00:11:06.320
Caption: let&#39;s try it one more time

00:11:06.838 --> 00:11:10.559
Caption: yeah all right cool I was right I just

00:11:08.458 --> 00:11:12.000
Caption: typed it wrong so this time around I use

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:13.380
Caption: that credential management API and as I

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.018
Caption: got a successful login I stored the

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.299
Caption: thing in the browser uh so if I log out

00:11:16.018 --> 00:11:21.359
Caption: again and then go to login it&#39;s going to

00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:23.518
Caption: know it&#39;s me and suggest that in uh sign

00:11:21.359 --> 00:11:26.278
Caption: in look at that do you want to sign into

00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:27.958
Caption: this film I absolutely do sign in so

00:11:26.278 --> 00:11:29.640
Caption: we&#39;ve turned in this particular case our

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.619
Caption: sign-in process from having to remember

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.500
Caption: your username and password uh having to

00:11:31.619 --> 00:11:36.778
Caption: type it all in into a single click a

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.059
Caption: single tap and we&#39;re through and I&#39;m

00:11:36.778 --> 00:11:39.898
Caption: very excited about that sadly obviously

00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:41.458
Caption: we&#39;ve got stuck at two Vector

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:42.179
Caption: authentication again

00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:43.799
Caption: um

00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:47.099
Caption: which hasn&#39;t even come through now oh

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:48.539
Caption: it&#39;s 941525 there we go I have a bank

00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:50.880
Caption: that um

00:11:48.539 --> 00:11:52.259
Caption: screams at me every time they send me a

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.479
Caption: text message with a code and be like

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.458
Caption: never tell anyone this and like it times

00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:59.659
Caption: out in five minutes

00:11:56.458 --> 00:11:59.659
Caption: I will tell people then

00:12:00.359 --> 00:12:03.479
Caption: it&#39;s true you shouldn&#39;t obviously share

00:12:02.099 --> 00:12:05.099
Caption: these things oh my God I&#39;m gonna run out

00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:06.958
Caption: of time brilliant so we&#39;ve got logged in

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:08.398
Caption: let&#39;s go back I&#39;m gonna run out of time

00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.719
Caption: if I don&#39;t get through this uh so let&#39;s

00:12:08.398 --> 00:12:11.880
Caption: talk about two facts authentication I

00:12:09.719 --> 00:12:13.018
Caption: think it&#39;s super important because we

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.359
Caption: have these

00:12:13.018 --> 00:12:17.219
Caption: um these names and passwords and people

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:19.500
Caption: who don&#39;t use password managers and

00:12:17.219 --> 00:12:21.119
Caption: people who uh repeat themselves and use

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.440
Caption: the same Parcels all the time and the

00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:25.078
Caption: whole thing is friction over and over

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.338
Caption: again right uh so password reuse this

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:28.380
Caption: was in the same survey that I mentioned

00:12:26.338 --> 00:12:30.479
Caption: at the start uh the blue slice of the

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:33.419
Caption: pie there uh is people who reuse

00:12:30.479 --> 00:12:35.880
Caption: passwords some of the time the yellow

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:37.979
Caption: slices people who reuse passwords all of

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.778
Caption: the time I love that the people

00:12:37.979 --> 00:12:42.778
Caption: answering the survey were just like how

00:12:39.778 --> 00:12:44.820
Caption: many passwords do I have just one I just

00:12:42.778 --> 00:12:46.320
Caption: use it everywhere it&#39;s the greatest

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.660
Caption: password those are the people getting

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.660
Caption: hacked all of the time it was 13 of

00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:54.539
Caption: people in this particular survey 52 said

00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:56.338
Caption: some of the time uh 13 said all of the

00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:58.018
Caption: time I reuse passwords and then this

00:12:56.338 --> 00:13:00.299
Caption: nice little green slice of people who

00:12:58.018 --> 00:13:02.039
Caption: say they never reuse password 35 of

00:13:00.299 --> 00:13:04.619
Caption: people in the survey said they never

00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:06.599
Caption: reuse passwords I&#39;ll remind you that 24

00:13:04.619 --> 00:13:09.479
Caption: of people said that they use a password

00:13:06.599 --> 00:13:13.338
Caption: manager so 11 of people have a

00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:13.338
Caption: photographic memory or they&#39;re lying

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.700
Caption: and that&#39;s what I use this for you

00:13:17.578 --> 00:13:22.739
Caption: um it&#39;s a bad experience and so uh and

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.898
Caption: and thus you know we also do um that

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:26.278
Caption: always comes up too tiny uh we uh the

00:13:24.898 --> 00:13:28.619
Caption: problem about this is is our problem

00:13:26.278 --> 00:13:30.958
Caption: we&#39;ve put all these problematic password

00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:32.039
Caption: things in the way of people uh your

00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.018
Caption: password must contain at least eight

00:13:32.039 --> 00:13:35.578
Caption: letters a capital a protagonist with

00:13:34.018 --> 00:13:37.619
Caption: good character development a Twist and a

00:13:35.578 --> 00:13:39.119
Caption: happy ending

00:13:37.619 --> 00:13:40.559
Caption: if you can you&#39;ll never remember that

00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:43.799
Caption: past or maybe you&#39;ll only ever remember

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:45.299
Caption: that password it&#39;s a great story

00:13:43.799 --> 00:13:47.278
Caption: um but what this actually you know the

00:13:45.299 --> 00:13:48.898
Caption: real the real things we do is say we

00:13:47.278 --> 00:13:50.578
Caption: must have a capital letter uh some

00:13:48.898 --> 00:13:52.078
Caption: lowercase letters a number and a special

00:13:50.578 --> 00:13:54.000
Caption: character right and this is the perfect

00:13:52.078 --> 00:13:55.559
Caption: password for that because it does

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.940
Caption: everything it&#39;s got eight characters

00:13:55.559 --> 00:13:59.179
Caption: it&#39;s got ten characters in it look at

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:02.458
Caption: that enormously long password

00:13:59.179 --> 00:14:05.039
Caption: but this gives um attackers uh an easy

00:14:02.458 --> 00:14:06.299
Caption: way to um patternize things it&#39;s a

00:14:05.039 --> 00:14:07.559
Caption: dictionary word which starts with a

00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:08.820
Caption: capital letter ends with the number one

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:10.380
Caption: because why would you think Beyond one

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.638
Caption: and uses the exclamation point because

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.559
Caption: it&#39;s a special character but it uses the

00:14:11.638 --> 00:14:14.820
Caption: same key as number one you don&#39;t even

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:16.380
Caption: have to move your finger when you&#39;re

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.940
Caption: typing it in

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.320
Caption: um and so when you have patterns like

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.419
Caption: this it makes it easier to Brute Force

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.338
Caption: attack this kind of thing and that&#39;s a

00:14:21.419 --> 00:14:25.138
Caption: bad thing and then on the other hand uh

00:14:23.338 --> 00:14:26.458
Caption: there are sites leaking our data all out

00:14:25.138 --> 00:14:27.778
Caption: over the place

00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:31.138
Caption: um and and if you don&#39;t know how I&#39;ve

00:14:27.778 --> 00:14:33.359
Caption: beenporn.com uh that&#39;s that gathers

00:14:31.138 --> 00:14:35.039
Caption: those uh leaks those breaches and shares

00:14:33.359 --> 00:14:38.159
Caption: just tell you whether your password has

00:14:35.039 --> 00:14:38.880
Caption: been part of that and yes it has

00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:40.799
Caption: um

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.440
Caption: so either other people are leaking out

00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:45.059
Caption: passwords or users are using the same

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.919
Caption: password or they&#39;re using an easily

00:14:45.059 --> 00:14:48.359
Caption: broken password and so that&#39;s why we

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:50.698
Caption: have two-factor authentication so we can

00:14:48.359 --> 00:14:52.320
Caption: have one extra Factor one other reason

00:14:50.698 --> 00:14:55.138
Caption: to believe that this person is the right

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.160
Caption: person signing in uh and hooray for two

00:14:55.138 --> 00:14:58.619
Caption: Factor

00:14:56.159 --> 00:15:00.239
Caption: um but the user experience remains on

00:14:58.619 --> 00:15:01.760
Caption: the poop scale of

00:15:00.239 --> 00:15:04.018
Caption: poop

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:07.018
Caption: because it&#39;s still more friction like I

00:15:04.018 --> 00:15:10.320
Caption: said we&#39;ve watched me struggle to enter

00:15:07.018 --> 00:15:12.000
Caption: a code several times just today and so

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.919
Caption: let&#39;s make it better we can actually

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.898
Caption: help these get Auto completed and auto

00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:17.940
Caption: filled in again so I&#39;m going back to the

00:15:15.898 --> 00:15:20.698
Caption: HTML and go back to autocomplete because

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:23.039
Caption: on the input when you have a code if you

00:15:20.698 --> 00:15:25.679
Caption: include autocomplete is one time code

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:28.320
Caption: then in Safari uh when your text message

00:15:25.679 --> 00:15:31.440
Caption: comes through uh it comes up in that

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.699
Caption: little autocomplete bot on the um uh

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.320
Caption: keyboard auto complete on the keyboard

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:36.239
Caption: right and it&#39;s just this one little

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.559
Caption: attribute that allows that to happen and

00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:39.059
Caption: it&#39;s wonderful and if you&#39;ve not seen it

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:41.760
Caption: before it looks like this you go to log

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:44.278
Caption: in you get the message sent to you and

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.260
Caption: uh and as you enter just go to into the

00:15:44.278 --> 00:15:48.539
Caption: code there it is Boom all right it&#39;s too

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.799
Caption: quick no friction

00:15:48.539 --> 00:15:51.359
Caption: it&#39;s wonderful

00:15:49.799 --> 00:15:52.440
Caption: um and and so you only need that one

00:15:51.359 --> 00:15:53.940
Caption: little thing for it so there it is

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.778
Caption: coming up in the top of the keyboard

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.458
Caption: there

00:15:54.778 --> 00:15:58.198
Caption: and you just hit that it enters with

00:15:56.458 --> 00:15:59.518
Caption: through it&#39;s glorious

00:15:58.198 --> 00:16:01.859
Caption: we can do some of the things to make

00:15:59.518 --> 00:16:04.260
Caption: this nicer uh if you&#39;re a one-time code

00:16:01.859 --> 00:16:05.940
Caption: input is a text input then you&#39;re going

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.958
Caption: to see the keyboard for text which is

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.239
Caption: not a good thing because it&#39;s normally

00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.739
Caption: six digits that we&#39;re entering and so if

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:12.359
Caption: you actually add like input mode as

00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:13.380
Caption: numeric uh it&#39;s going to make that a

00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:15.018
Caption: better experience for people who can&#39;t

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.458
Caption: Auto Complete because that brings you up

00:16:15.018 --> 00:16:20.940
Caption: your number keypad much nicer number

00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:22.320
Caption: keypad uh so let&#39;s think about that and

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.000
Caption: then what about the desktop I mean this

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.039
Caption: is only Safari right now and that was

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.599
Caption: only iOS that that showed up there but

00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:31.198
Caption: actually if you happen to be a big

00:16:27.599 --> 00:16:33.419
Caption: Safari fan and have your desktop Safari

00:16:31.198 --> 00:16:35.099
Caption: set up as well this actually works

00:16:33.419 --> 00:16:38.940
Caption: across to the desktop

00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:40.799
Caption: um and I&#39;m gonna hold up look at that

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.299
Caption: um the when the message comes through to

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:44.578
Caption: your iPhone if you&#39;ve got iMessage like

00:16:42.299 --> 00:16:46.440
Caption: set up onto your device as well it&#39;s

00:16:44.578 --> 00:16:49.619
Caption: going to do the autocomplete on your

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.258
Caption: desktop as long as you&#39;re in safari

00:16:49.619 --> 00:16:53.940
Caption: right

00:16:51.258 --> 00:16:56.099
Caption: so what&#39;s the other thing web OTP is our

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.320
Caption: is our final thing here uh this is the

00:16:56.099 --> 00:17:01.198
Caption: sort of Chrome Android and pushing to a

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.699
Caption: um web standard solution for this uh and

00:17:01.198 --> 00:17:04.558
Caption: it allows actually a bit more Security

00:17:02.698 --> 00:17:06.479
Caption: in this like that autocomplete kind of

00:17:04.558 --> 00:17:08.399
Caption: sort of works and but it really does

00:17:06.479 --> 00:17:10.020
Caption: actually just see a text message see

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.938
Caption: like six digits in it and assume

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.799
Caption: everything else Works whereas web OTP is

00:17:11.938 --> 00:17:16.558
Caption: a bit more strict than that

00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:18.539
Caption: um it enforces that the message that you

00:17:16.558 --> 00:17:20.298
Caption: send uh the two-factor authentication

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.859
Caption: code into have two bits at the end of it

00:17:20.298 --> 00:17:23.938
Caption: uh an at symbol followed by the domain

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.739
Caption: name on which the person should be

00:17:23.938 --> 00:17:27.900
Caption: logging in and then a hash symbol and

00:17:25.739 --> 00:17:29.280
Caption: then the code now the at symbol in the

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.260
Caption: domain allows the browser and the

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.000
Caption: operating system to agree uh to

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.859
Caption: autocomplete on this site in this site

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.959
Caption: only which is a good phishing defense

00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:40.020
Caption: right if you are being fished for your

00:17:36.959 --> 00:17:42.058
Caption: two-factor authentication code uh

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.558
Caption: you&#39;re on a different domain and

00:17:42.058 --> 00:17:45.119
Caption: therefore this will not offer the

00:17:43.558 --> 00:17:47.099
Caption: autocomplete for it because it doesn&#39;t

00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:50.699
Caption: match up so it&#39;s a security thing to

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:53.640
Caption: actually use this which is very nice

00:17:50.699 --> 00:17:56.099
Caption: um so uh web OTP actually uses that very

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.479
Caption: same credential management API uh looks

00:17:56.099 --> 00:17:58.979
Caption: a little like this like this and instead

00:17:57.479 --> 00:18:01.678
Caption: of asking for the password in this case

00:17:58.979 --> 00:18:03.178
Caption: we ask for the OTP transport of SMS I

00:18:01.678 --> 00:18:04.739
Caption: really like this because

00:18:03.178 --> 00:18:06.619
Caption: um that&#39;s an array which can have one

00:18:04.739 --> 00:18:09.000
Caption: element in it which is the string SMS

00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:11.219
Caption: which is which is cool

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.479
Caption: um got loads of options there to go in

00:18:11.219 --> 00:18:15.058
Caption: that array

00:18:12.479 --> 00:18:16.380
Caption: um so let&#39;s see that in action uh I&#39;m

00:18:15.058 --> 00:18:18.359
Caption: going to go to the demo and this time

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:22.140
Caption: bring up the phone I&#39;m going to do this

00:18:18.359 --> 00:18:22.140
Caption: on the phone this time uh

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.099
Caption: assuming we can get a browser there we

00:18:24.359 --> 00:18:28.199
Caption: go so if I go back and refresh this

00:18:26.099 --> 00:18:30.538
Caption: login page firstly what you&#39;ll notice is

00:18:28.199 --> 00:18:32.519
Caption: uh that because I&#39;m in logged in in both

00:18:30.538 --> 00:18:34.500
Caption: my Google account uh my Chrome account

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.880
Caption: on both the desktop and the phone that

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.558
Caption: it&#39;s already synced my username and

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.359
Caption: password across so that is already still

00:18:37.558 --> 00:18:41.520
Caption: a One Tap process to get through the

00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:45.199
Caption: username and password section and now no

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.200
Caption: I didn&#39;t restart the server no

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:51.440
Caption: I need to you know HP try that again

00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:58.699
Caption: because that wouldn&#39;t have had the code

00:18:56.699 --> 00:18:59.038
Caption: um

00:18:58.699 --> 00:19:00.659
Caption: [Music]

00:18:59.038 --> 00:19:02.279
Caption: um

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.299
Caption: I&#39;m gonna go back to login and start

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.299
Caption: again I don&#39;t know

00:19:05.939 --> 00:19:09.418
Caption: back to login we get off at the login

00:19:07.558 --> 00:19:11.880
Caption: this time it&#39;s going to send me the text

00:19:09.418 --> 00:19:14.099
Caption: message and offer me to auto complete

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.599
Caption: that text message

00:19:14.099 --> 00:19:17.219
Caption: so it&#39;s coming as the text and there&#39;s

00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:18.479
Caption: the permissions dialog to say hey do you

00:19:17.219 --> 00:19:20.038
Caption: want to read this and enter the code and

00:19:18.479 --> 00:19:23.160
Caption: we allow it we get access to the code

00:19:20.038 --> 00:19:25.678
Caption: and we&#39;re through our login has gone

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.140
Caption: from typing typing typing finding the

00:19:25.678 --> 00:19:31.019
Caption: phone and getting in there to tap to yes

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.579
Caption: log me in and tap yes use that code I

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.359
Caption: think that&#39;s cool

00:19:32.579 --> 00:19:35.339
Caption: um

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:36.839
Caption: but you might be asking

00:19:35.339 --> 00:19:40.020
Caption: uh what about the desktop in this

00:19:36.839 --> 00:19:41.939
Caption: particular case and um

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.640
Caption: uh the desktop actually works as well

00:19:41.939 --> 00:19:47.219
Caption: it&#39;s very cool um I hope it works so it

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.799
Caption: can be a bit finicky but if you are in

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:53.038
Caption: Chrome uh in your Android device and

00:19:49.798 --> 00:19:54.319
Caption: your browser and they all agree with

00:19:53.038 --> 00:19:57.599
Caption: each other that you&#39;re the same person

00:19:54.319 --> 00:20:00.119
Caption: then the mobile device will offer you up

00:19:57.599 --> 00:20:01.739
Caption: to copy across the code that has arrived

00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:04.439
Caption: from the text message into the browser

00:20:01.739 --> 00:20:05.880
Caption: it tends to require the the devices to

00:20:04.439 --> 00:20:07.678
Caption: be on the same network as well that has

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.178
Caption: failed for me in the past and I have not

00:20:07.678 --> 00:20:10.500
Caption: yet managed to check because this is a

00:20:09.178 --> 00:20:13.500
Caption: last minute talk I haven&#39;t managed to

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.599
Caption: check if this works on this network but

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.099
Caption: cross your fingers for me we&#39;re gonna go

00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:19.260
Caption: and log in we&#39;re going to sign in with a

00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:21.058
Caption: one tap and what we should see is the

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:23.520
Caption: text message coming over here on the

00:20:21.058 --> 00:20:25.319
Caption: right hand side and then an offer to

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.940
Caption: copy that across

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:29.399
Caption: or

00:20:26.939 --> 00:20:31.678
Caption: just crash the browser in the background

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.479
Caption: amazing

00:20:31.678 --> 00:20:34.859
Caption: that was unexpected

00:20:33.479 --> 00:20:36.359
Caption: um

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:39.298
Caption: let&#39;s let&#39;s

00:20:36.359 --> 00:20:40.678
Caption: give it one more attempt at that uh I&#39;m

00:20:39.298 --> 00:20:42.298
Caption: gonna log in with that it doesn&#39;t need

00:20:40.678 --> 00:20:43.260
Caption: the browser to be open this is just the

00:20:42.298 --> 00:20:46.079
Caption: the

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.520
Caption: um the device doing it and so the

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:49.199
Caption: message should arrive and then it should

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.539
Caption: give you the option there we go submit

00:20:49.199 --> 00:20:53.038
Caption: this code on the other computer if I

00:20:51.538 --> 00:20:54.899
Caption: press submit there I&#39;m hands off for the

00:20:53.038 --> 00:20:57.058
Caption: other side we submit the code and it

00:20:54.900 --> 00:21:00.059
Caption: enters it and logs me in

00:20:57.058 --> 00:21:01.979
Caption: um so uh the the security there like you

00:21:00.058 --> 00:21:03.839
Caption: have to be able you have to you know say

00:21:01.979 --> 00:21:05.819
Caption: that that code is allowed to go from

00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:06.659
Caption: this device to the computer and yeah if

00:21:05.819 --> 00:21:07.739
Caption: you&#39;re not in the same network and

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.760
Caption: things like that it&#39;s not going to offer

00:21:07.739 --> 00:21:10.558
Caption: that up

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.000
Caption: um but now our two-factor authentication

00:21:10.558 --> 00:21:13.020
Caption: is just a

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.780
Caption: um

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:17.160
Caption: it&#39;s much less friction uh so it works

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.559
Caption: across the desktop as well at least if

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.940
Caption: you&#39;re in Chrome and Chrome uh just

00:21:19.558 --> 00:21:23.219
Caption: talking a little bit about the future

00:21:20.939 --> 00:21:24.959
Caption: like I I kind of

00:21:23.219 --> 00:21:28.439
Caption: um laugh at the idea that we have this

00:21:24.959 --> 00:21:29.880
Caption: uh single array uh that has one

00:21:28.439 --> 00:21:31.558
Caption: potential element to it but I like this

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.479
Caption: because it&#39;s the way that Webb gets uh

00:21:31.558 --> 00:21:35.399
Caption: designed and designed well it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:21:33.479 --> 00:21:36.719
Caption: designed for extensibility and if we

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.960
Caption: come up with other transports and other

00:21:36.719 --> 00:21:43.199
Caption: ways to get an OTP code from a device uh

00:21:39.959 --> 00:21:44.279
Caption: we can add to this API and so I hope uh

00:21:43.199 --> 00:21:46.558
Caption: that this is something that can be built

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:49.380
Caption: to to deal with authenticator apps or

00:21:46.558 --> 00:21:50.819
Caption: indeed um other device based uh

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.159
Caption: Authentication

00:21:50.819 --> 00:21:55.259
Caption: uh being able to web authen maybe from a

00:21:53.159 --> 00:21:56.520
Caption: from a phone to a to a desktop anything

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.039
Caption: like that

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.500
Caption: um this is extensible and ready but in

00:21:59.038 --> 00:22:02.579
Caption: general I think uh these little these

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.839
Caption: little changes these little tweaks

00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:05.158
Caption: credential management API and the

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:07.739
Caption: autocomplete kind of things that we have

00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:09.059
Caption: available to us allow us to uh enhance

00:22:07.739 --> 00:22:10.260
Caption: and progressively enhance because it

00:22:09.058 --> 00:22:11.939
Caption: doesn&#39;t work everywhere that

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:15.058
Caption: progressively enhance the experience for

00:22:11.939 --> 00:22:16.379
Caption: login and uh and I&#39;d recommend that you

00:22:15.058 --> 00:22:18.239
Caption: take another look at your own login

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.798
Caption: flows and see if you can reduce the

00:22:18.239 --> 00:22:22.500
Caption: friction for your users when they&#39;re

00:22:19.798 --> 00:22:24.418
Caption: getting into the into your application

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.979
Caption: um that&#39;s uh that was a bit quick but

00:22:24.418 --> 00:22:27.599
Caption: hopefully that was interesting my name

00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:29.099
