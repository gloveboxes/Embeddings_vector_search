Caption: hello hello welcome back I&#39;m seeing some

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:08.638
Caption: familiar faces as well so yeah welcome

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.800
Caption: back uh it&#39;s my delight to introduce uh

00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:13.079
Caption: doctor isn&#39;t it right Dr Ashley Aitkin

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.360
Caption: Ashley Aitkin has a passion for helping

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.399
Caption: businesses create value with it helping

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:20.399
Caption: startups find successful business models

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:22.920
Caption: and all things related to AI minds and

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.618
Caption: brains today he&#39;s going to explain what

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.000
Caption: it means to say we are all computers and

00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:29.399
Caption: the implications this may have for

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.159
Caption: building conscious machines buckle up

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:35.459
Caption: it&#39;s going to be a wild ride here&#39;s

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.459
Caption: Ashley wonderful

00:00:35.578 --> 00:00:39.718
Caption: thank you very much Hannah and thank you

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:41.700
Caption: much everyone for coming along as you

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.559
Caption: said my talk today I&#39;m a computer and so

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.059
Caption: are you and my goal here is really

00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:47.339
Caption: trying to to convince you of the

00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:48.718
Caption: validity of this statement okay but

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.159
Caption: after we&#39;ve done that we&#39;ll have a look

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.600
Caption: at some more bigger questions which I

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.578
Caption: don&#39;t have the answer to but I think you

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:57.599
Caption: might find uh interesting as well

00:00:53.578 --> 00:00:59.398
Caption: so I&#39;m a computer and so are you

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.119
Caption: let&#39;s go on

00:00:59.398 --> 00:01:02.878
Caption: um

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:05.220
Caption: this all started many years ago when I

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.919
Caption: was doing a PhD in Ai and I was trying

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.380
Caption: to make computers work more like humans

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:12.599
Caption: be more able to match the world and and

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:14.639
Caption: work in a fuzzy World in a wishing world

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:16.919
Caption: but after doing my PhD for a number of

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:18.959
Caption: years I realized really it wasn&#39;t about

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:21.360
Caption: that it came back to me thinking that

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:22.860
Caption: computers are actually more like oh

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.020
Caption: sorry the brain is mostly more like

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.400
Caption: computers and this really shocked me I

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:28.379
Caption: got a total flip of what I&#39;m doing

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.459
Caption: that&#39;s what I want to try and explain to

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:31.618
Caption: you today

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:34.199
Caption: but just to be clear up front when I say

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.180
Caption: is a brain is more like a computer I I

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:37.739
Caption: don&#39;t mean a Von Neumann type

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.540
Caption: architecture avoid Norman type

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:41.879
Caption: architecture with a CPU and RAM of

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.259
Caption: course we&#39;re not like that and one of

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:45.078
Caption: the things I want to talk about today is

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.000
Caption: what actually it is it to be a computer

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.259
Caption: I did computer science for many years I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.119
Caption: worked with an academic in computer

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.159
Caption: science for many years and I&#39;ll tell you

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.600
Caption: the 95 percent of people in that domain

00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:56.158
Caption: probably don&#39;t know what it means to be

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:58.438
Caption: a computer it&#39;s something you program

00:01:56.158 --> 00:02:00.059
Caption: for sure but what does it mean to be a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.740
Caption: computer that&#39;s what we&#39;d be talking

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:03.478
Caption: about as well

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.938
Caption: so here&#39;s the sort of overview of the

00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:08.039
Caption: story for my talk the first big question

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.259
Caption: is what are computers to get you to

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.080
Caption: understand that question the second one

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.760
Caption: is what am I and by contrast you because

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.378
Caption: you&#39;re similar to me hopefully

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:18.000
Caption: and then last one the big question there

00:02:16.378 --> 00:02:19.979
Caption: what is I

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.539
Caption: that&#39;s the one which I may not be able

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:23.958
Caption: to answer but we&#39;ll get a good start on

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.958
Caption: I think

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.779
Caption: um a bit background about myself I work

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.699
Caption: as an I.T consultant for a company

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:32.279
Caption: called business aspect a parent company

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:34.139
Caption: data number three I have a background in

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:36.059
Caption: AI cognitive science and Neuroscience

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:38.039
Caption: but I think of myself as a software

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:40.080
Caption: developer and an I.T person and a

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:42.179
Caption: computer scientist I have a big focus on

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.919
Caption: Innovation Consulting I like to help

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:46.619
Caption: because I think Hannah said startups but

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:48.958
Caption: also organizations in any sector any

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:50.878
Caption: stage of maturity including startups to

00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.559
Caption: find new businesses if the old

00:02:50.878 --> 00:02:54.598
Caption: businesses are going away to find a new

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.738
Caption: one and we do that using an exploration

00:02:54.598 --> 00:02:58.800
Caption: metaphor

00:02:55.738 --> 00:03:00.419
Caption: I also run Lean Startup Perth Meetup

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.580
Caption: and I have a number of number of

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.080
Caption: startups myself the current one which is

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.479
Caption: just about to go live soon is called

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.639
Caption: lean Explorers Club so please look out

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:11.458
Caption: for that

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.378
Caption: okay so also thanks to our sponsors and

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:15.720
Caption: the volunteers who run this conference

00:03:13.378 --> 00:03:17.339
Caption: particularly I met some at the cat&#39;s

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.040
Caption: feature catch-up night insight and

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:21.658
Caption: Versant and Planet so thanks to them but

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:25.399
Caption: thanks to all the sponsors who helped

00:03:21.658 --> 00:03:25.399
Caption: this make this event possible

00:03:26.158 --> 00:03:31.199
Caption: okay um in this same room a couple of

00:03:29.158 --> 00:03:32.819
Caption: years ago I gave a talk on functional

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.639
Caption: programming and my goal there was to

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.679
Caption: make everyone&#39;s mind explode blow their

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.598
Caption: brains with the oils quantum computers

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:41.939
Caption: sorry blow their minds with quantum

00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:44.878
Caption: computers last year I tried to help

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.738
Caption: people become anti-fragile and when you

00:03:44.878 --> 00:03:48.598
Caption: lose your head to grow back two new ones

00:03:46.738 --> 00:03:50.158
Caption: to replace that one head

00:03:48.598 --> 00:03:52.259
Caption: this year I&#39;m taking a bit of a

00:03:50.158 --> 00:03:54.658
Caption: different tack now as I mentioned in the

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:57.238
Caption: brief I&#39;m going to be trying out some

00:03:54.658 --> 00:03:59.399
Caption: pain okay so experience something pain

00:03:57.238 --> 00:04:01.559
Caption: but also try and some mind altering

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:03.598
Caption: experiences here trying to get you to

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:06.179
Caption: think differently about your mind so

00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:08.279
Caption: let&#39;s see how we go with that

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:10.018
Caption: okay so the first point here what are

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.458
Caption: computers think to yourself what do I

00:04:10.018 --> 00:04:13.619
Caption: what&#39;s you know it&#39;s a digital computer

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:15.658
Caption: I program it but what do we mean when we

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:18.419
Caption: talk about computers

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:20.880
Caption: this sort of thing okay a computer what

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.380
Caption: do we mean by that now maybe if you sort

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.000
Caption: of got a computer science background or

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.399
Caption: a technical background you may think oh

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.380
Caption: well computers are equivalent to Turing

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:30.239
Caption: machines or they have a Von Neumann

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.759
Caption: architecture and so forth there&#39;s

00:04:30.239 --> 00:04:34.199
Caption: something which is runs like this or you

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:37.080
Caption: may also think you know a computer

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.820
Caption: computability can I calculate something

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:41.039
Caption: with this computer or compute something

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.259
Caption: with an algorithm you may think about

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.960
Caption: algorithms and you may think about oh

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.820
Caption: yeah computers do calculations these

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:49.919
Caption: sort of things and these are all correct

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.139
Caption: but they don&#39;t get to what the essence

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.300
Caption: is of a computer and that&#39;s what I want

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.679
Caption: to try and to explain now this slide has

00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:57.239
Caption: a lot of text so it&#39;s the formal

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:59.399
Caption: definition of things but I&#39;ll just point

00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:01.679
Caption: out the key points to you I&#39;ll read it

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:05.100
Caption: out to you it has a computational system

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:07.859
Caption: is a physical system that allows three

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.119
Caption: specific but more General levels of

00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:11.879
Caption: description

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:13.440
Caption: above that of the physical level and

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.779
Caption: these three levels are what we call the

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.639
Caption: functional level the symbolic level and

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:19.199
Caption: the semantic level you may have heard of

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.720
Caption: those there are a couple extra

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.600
Caption: requirements the symbolic states in the

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.459
Caption: symbolic level they refer to things so

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.199
Caption: when your computer has a symbol for a

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:30.059
Caption: car it&#39;s not actually the car inside the

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.399
Caption: computer it&#39;s a reference to that car

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.479
Caption: and the third one says that the symbols

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:35.339
Caption: need to be consistent under

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.500
Caption: transformations

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.519
Caption: that&#39;s the definition of a computational

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.679
Caption: system

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:42.660
Caption: and I want to explain that to you so you

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:45.299
Caption: can see what computers really are and

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.919
Caption: then we&#39;ll look at how the brain works

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:49.440
Caption: so of course the computer&#39;s a physical

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.479
Caption: system so any physical system we can

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.820
Caption: give a description in terms of the

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.039
Caption: physical states where the particles are

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.899
Caption: and which direction they&#39;re moving

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:59.759
Caption: and of course they obey the physical

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.500
Caption: laws so the particle is going to go

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.639
Caption: around ignoring Quantum Mechanics for

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.440
Caption: now they&#39;re going to move around like

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.759
Caption: particles do and bump bump into things

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.519
Caption: and so forth

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.139
Caption: we can&#39;t break the physical laws but we

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:12.479
Caption: can change the configuration of the

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.460
Caption: system to make it do things while still

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.959
Caption: obeying those physical laws

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:17.880
Caption: so we have this physical level

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:19.799
Caption: description

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.779
Caption: we start off in a physical state on the

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:23.519
Caption: left our initial State we go to the next

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:25.739
Caption: state according to the physical Lords

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:28.259
Caption: the physical laws tell us how we go from

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:29.459
Caption: one state to the next and so on and so

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.139
Caption: on

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:32.759
Caption: that&#39;s pretty obvious

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.559
Caption: but now what we say that one thing that

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:36.899
Caption: a computational system allows is it

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:38.279
Caption: allows a higher level description

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:39.899
Caption: we don&#39;t need to talk about the

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.160
Caption: particles anymore when you describe your

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:42.600
Caption: computer you don&#39;t say well these are

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.619
Caption: particles here and particles moving

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.779
Caption: there

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:47.579
Caption: when you describe a computer in the

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:49.440
Caption: functional description you describe it

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:51.720
Caption: in terms of functional States

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.819
Caption: and the functional specification or

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.799
Caption: configuration of that system

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.679
Caption: these functional states are actually

00:06:55.799 --> 00:07:00.539
Caption: defined in terms of equivalent sets of

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:02.579
Caption: physical States and this is a really

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:05.039
Caption: important concept we&#39;re going to a

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:06.659
Caption: higher level description ignoring the

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:09.119
Caption: difference in certain physical States

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.979
Caption: and will describe it that way let me

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:12.720
Caption: show you in a picture

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:14.519
Caption: the first word before I show you that

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.319
Caption: we&#39;re looking at a very simplified model

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:18.000
Caption: of computing and so forth here which can

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.799
Caption: look at one input gives us a direct

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.959
Caption: output and I&#39;ll explain the complexity

00:07:19.799 --> 00:07:24.119
Caption: later on so on the left we have the

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:26.638
Caption: input State and on the right we have the

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:28.859
Caption: output state

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.720
Caption: um input goes to Output very simple way

00:07:28.859 --> 00:07:33.598
Caption: to understand things

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.000
Caption: so let&#39;s have a look at the next slide

00:07:33.598 --> 00:07:38.759
Caption: sorry I lost my connection there what is

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.598
Caption: this functional description for a

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.580
Caption: computer

00:07:39.598 --> 00:07:43.440
Caption: well as I say we ignore the position of

00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:45.839
Caption: the atoms and then moving around in the

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.179
Caption: electrons and we tend to describe the

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:51.239
Caption: physical computer in terms of voltages

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:54.000
Caption: this memory chip this memory cell has a

00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:55.079
Caption: voltage of 0.2 volts well this y has a

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Caption: voltage

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:59.459
Caption: so this is another description of a

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.739
Caption: computer above the physical level in

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:04.079
Caption: terms of these voltages in the

00:08:01.739 --> 00:08:06.660
Caption: particular memory cells for example

00:08:04.079 --> 00:08:09.299
Caption: and of course

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:12.179
Caption: when you go from the input here a 0.2

00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:13.319
Caption: volts you may go to another state 0.9

00:08:12.179 --> 00:08:15.000
Caption: volts

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:16.859
Caption: but again that&#39;s just really an

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.019
Caption: abstraction over the lower level States

00:08:16.859 --> 00:08:21.000
Caption: lots of different atoms running around

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:23.638
Caption: in different directions could make

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.319
Caption: equivalent to 0.9 volts

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:26.940
Caption: so the ones on the bottom are showing

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:29.940
Caption: you there&#39;s a whole lot of equivalent

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.559
Caption: physical states which correspond to 0.2

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.299
Caption: volts and there&#39;s a whole lot of

00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:36.539
Caption: equivalent physical states which

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:39.479
Caption: correspond to 0.9 volts but we ignore

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:41.278
Caption: that detail and just look at the top

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:43.559
Caption: so when the system actually goes from

00:08:41.278 --> 00:08:45.179
Caption: input to Output it could go from this

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.338
Caption: physical state to that physical state

00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:48.599
Caption: inside the set or it could do a

00:08:47.338 --> 00:08:50.338
Caption: different one or it could do a different

00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:52.619
Caption: one we don&#39;t really care about that

00:08:50.338 --> 00:08:55.320
Caption: detail we just care at the functional

00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:57.778
Caption: level it goes from zero to two volts to

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.518
Caption: 0.9 volts that&#39;s a functional

00:08:57.778 --> 00:09:01.979
Caption: description someone is interested in

00:08:59.518 --> 00:09:03.599
Caption: electronics would probably look at that

00:09:01.979 --> 00:09:05.278
Caption: sort of description

00:09:03.599 --> 00:09:06.299
Caption: that&#39;s the functional description of a

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:07.919
Caption: computer

00:09:06.299 --> 00:09:09.539
Caption: but where it gets interesting now is

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:11.159
Caption: when we step up one level to this

00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:14.639
Caption: symbolic level description

00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:17.219
Caption: in symbolic States and rules here we

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.440
Caption: have symbols which are referring to

00:09:17.219 --> 00:09:21.239
Caption: things and rules which how they describe

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.099
Caption: how they change

00:09:21.239 --> 00:09:24.778
Caption: so have a look again at our diagram now

00:09:23.099 --> 00:09:27.359
Caption: we think of this computer as a symbol

00:09:24.778 --> 00:09:30.239
Caption: system we have a symbolic state zero or

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:32.159
Caption: one and that&#39;s zero or one in memory

00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:36.299
Caption: cells could be anything less than 0.5

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:39.179
Caption: volts so for 0.4 or 0.2 or 0.3 we don&#39;t

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:40.320
Caption: care we say it&#39;s a zero a false or a

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:42.539
Caption: zero bit

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.518
Caption: and going from input to outputs because

00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:47.099
Caption: okay we go from zero to one there&#39;s a

00:09:44.518 --> 00:09:49.139
Caption: rule if zero then one because it&#39;s wired

00:09:47.099 --> 00:09:52.619
Caption: up in this way we don&#39;t care whether the

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:54.299
Caption: final state is 0.6 or 0.9 we ignore that

00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:56.880
Caption: detail and just say it goes from a zero

00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:58.859
Caption: to one so now we&#39;re thinking about bits

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.140
Caption: we&#39;re working at a symbolic level in

00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:04.679
Caption: terms of symbolic States and the rules

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:06.359
Caption: which say how they transfer or change

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:08.039
Caption: so this is the symbol level and this is

00:10:06.359 --> 00:10:10.079
Caption: the level we sort of program computers

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:12.000
Caption: at and we&#39;ll get back to that as I said

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.980
Caption: doesn&#39;t matter the states below we don&#39;t

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.659
Caption: care about the details of course it is

00:10:13.979 --> 00:10:17.159
Caption: going from one physical state to the

00:10:15.659 --> 00:10:20.338
Caption: next but we just treat them as

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:22.319
Caption: equivalent at this symbolic level

00:10:20.338 --> 00:10:24.539
Caption: now the last level is the semantic level

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.660
Caption: this is the highest level where we talk

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:30.000
Caption: about semantic States and principles of

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:31.859
Caption: operation so we had physical laws we

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.679
Caption: have rules and now we have principles of

00:10:31.859 --> 00:10:36.898
Caption: operation semantic states are similarly

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:39.179
Caption: defined in sets of equivalent states of

00:10:36.898 --> 00:10:41.159
Caption: equivalent symbolic States and the

00:10:39.179 --> 00:10:45.380
Caption: principles describe how you go from one

00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:45.379
Caption: semantic state to another semantic state

00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:50.639
Caption: this shows you in a computer at the top

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:52.500
Caption: there we have this semantic level now we

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.720
Caption: represent the symbols Below in quotes

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.219
Caption: but how do you sort of represent a

00:10:54.719 --> 00:10:57.239
Caption: semantic State we sort of put them in

00:10:56.219 --> 00:10:59.159
Caption: Brackets

00:10:57.239 --> 00:11:01.200
Caption: so on the left for the input State we

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:02.940
Caption: have four plus two

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.040
Caption: but that&#39;s equivalent to a number of

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.559
Caption: different symbolic States we could be in

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:09.898
Caption: it could be in four plus two or three

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:11.458
Caption: plus three it doesn&#39;t matter what those

00:11:09.898 --> 00:11:13.919
Caption: symbols are they&#39;re all equivalent to

00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:15.958
Caption: the concept of four plus two

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:19.078
Caption: and when you use that four plus two

00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:20.278
Caption: semantic state it goes to the semantic

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:21.898
Caption: state of six

00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:23.578
Caption: and that could be represented in

00:11:21.898 --> 00:11:24.898
Caption: different ways as well it could be the

00:11:23.578 --> 00:11:26.699
Caption: number six or it could be written word

00:11:24.898 --> 00:11:28.859
Caption: six we don&#39;t care

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.079
Caption: so again we&#39;ve gone to a higher level of

00:11:28.859 --> 00:11:33.239
Caption: description which is more easier to

00:11:31.078 --> 00:11:35.398
Caption: understand and more useful the semantic

00:11:33.239 --> 00:11:38.239
Caption: level the semantic level is also called

00:11:35.398 --> 00:11:38.239
Caption: the knowledge level

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:43.799
Caption: so and again we go at that symbolic

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.419
Caption: level still there it&#39;s not gone away we

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:47.518
Caption: can go from different symbolic States

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:49.679
Caption: but we ignore that and just say we go

00:11:47.518 --> 00:11:51.739
Caption: from the four plus two to the sixth

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:51.739
Caption: state

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.920
Caption: so this is what competition

00:11:53.398 --> 00:11:58.559
Caption: computational systems are a physical

00:11:55.919 --> 00:12:01.139
Caption: system with three levels of abstraction

00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:03.359
Caption: above that physical level

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:06.119
Caption: going from functional states to symbolic

00:12:03.359 --> 00:12:09.479
Caption: states with rules to semantic states

00:12:06.119 --> 00:12:12.119
Caption: with principles of operations

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:14.278
Caption: and computers are computational systems

00:12:12.119 --> 00:12:16.380
Caption: as I&#39;ve shown they have these three

00:12:14.278 --> 00:12:18.539
Caption: levels of description and the symbols

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.578
Caption: can refer to things and the symbols can

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:22.559
Caption: be consistent so computers are

00:12:20.578 --> 00:12:24.119
Caption: computational systems and that&#39;s what we

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:26.958
Caption: mean what is a computer it&#39;s a

00:12:24.119 --> 00:12:26.958
Caption: computational system

00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:30.599
Caption: so why are the computational systems as

00:12:28.979 --> 00:12:32.518
Caption: I mentioned they have these three

00:12:30.599 --> 00:12:34.380
Caption: different levels the functional level

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:36.479
Caption: with the voltages and the functional

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.220
Caption: specification the symbolic level with

00:12:36.479 --> 00:12:40.679
Caption: the symbols and the rules of behavior

00:12:38.219 --> 00:12:42.119
Caption: sort of like the code and the semantic

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:44.599
Caption: level with the concepts and the

00:12:42.119 --> 00:12:44.599
Caption: principles

00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:49.440
Caption: now the nice thing about this is these

00:12:47.398 --> 00:12:51.719
Caption: higher levels of description can ignore

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.239
Caption: the lower level details and you get much

00:12:51.719 --> 00:12:55.799
Caption: more value from a higher level if I told

00:12:54.239 --> 00:12:57.719
Caption: you know all the atoms in this thing

00:12:55.799 --> 00:12:59.940
Caption: were this organized you couldn&#39;t tell me

00:12:57.719 --> 00:13:01.619
Caption: much about the thing but if I told you a

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.838
Caption: higher level description it&#39;s more

00:13:01.619 --> 00:13:06.778
Caption: useful to you and this is why we do the

00:13:03.838 --> 00:13:08.578
Caption: levels of abstraction

00:13:06.778 --> 00:13:11.219
Caption: now computers aren&#39;t the only things

00:13:08.578 --> 00:13:13.799
Caption: that are computational systems of course

00:13:11.219 --> 00:13:15.898
Caption: a calculator it&#39;s almost like a computer

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:18.778
Caption: but even a physical calculator like this

00:13:15.898 --> 00:13:20.219
Caption: is a computational system it&#39;s just got

00:13:18.778 --> 00:13:22.440
Caption: a different implementation it&#39;s not

00:13:20.219 --> 00:13:23.819
Caption: implemented in terms of electronics it&#39;s

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.919
Caption: basically implemented in terms of

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.119
Caption: mechanical States and mechanical

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:29.099
Caption: configuration

00:13:27.119 --> 00:13:31.739
Caption: but we abstract over those mechanical

00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:33.659
Caption: case states to say there&#39;s a symbol if

00:13:31.739 --> 00:13:35.940
Caption: the button&#39;s up this high or above this

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:38.699
Caption: level then it&#39;s a one-off is down below

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.619
Caption: this level it&#39;s a zero or so forth so we

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.600
Caption: can Implement a computational system in

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:45.000
Caption: a mechanical system as well

00:13:42.599 --> 00:13:47.338
Caption: and this gives us a good uh

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.859
Caption: hint that possibly we can implement the

00:13:47.338 --> 00:13:52.200
Caption: brain in a non-biological system because

00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:54.239
Caption: we&#39;re abstracting above that biolog

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.639
Caption: biology to the functional to the

00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:59.219
Caption: symbolic and into semantic levels

00:13:56.638 --> 00:14:01.078
Caption: and again you know a calculator the

00:13:59.219 --> 00:14:03.179
Caption: semantics are pretty clear that the

00:14:01.078 --> 00:14:05.338
Caption: semantics of a calculator are the number

00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:07.018
Caption: States we don&#39;t care how the numbers

00:14:05.338 --> 00:14:09.958
Caption: represented in the calculator whether

00:14:07.018 --> 00:14:11.578
Caption: it&#39;s buttons or number or a screen and

00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.380
Caption: the principles of operations for a

00:14:11.578 --> 00:14:15.958
Caption: calculator are mathematics

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.539
Caption: the ad operation the minus operation the

00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:20.278
Caption: multiply operation and the symbols need

00:14:18.539 --> 00:14:22.440
Caption: to be constructed to obey those

00:14:20.278 --> 00:14:24.479
Caption: particular semantics to build a

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.679
Caption: functional calculator

00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:27.958
Caption: so we have lots of different

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:30.599
Caption: computational systems calculators

00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:33.838
Caption: computers and others

00:14:30.599 --> 00:14:36.778
Caption: but the big question now is to ask what

00:14:33.838 --> 00:14:38.278
Caption: am I and what are you and I want to make

00:14:36.778 --> 00:14:41.638
Caption: the claim that we&#39;re a computational

00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:43.078
Caption: system as well and try and explain that

00:14:41.638 --> 00:14:44.518
Caption: now when I&#39;m starting here I&#39;m starting

00:14:43.078 --> 00:14:45.838
Caption: from certain assumptions which you may

00:14:44.518 --> 00:14:47.880
Caption: disagree with but these are my

00:14:45.838 --> 00:14:49.799
Caption: assumptions my assumption is that

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.660
Caption: basically we&#39;re a biological information

00:14:49.799 --> 00:14:53.398
Caption: processing system

00:14:51.659 --> 00:14:54.778
Caption: we don&#39;t have electrons running around

00:14:53.398 --> 00:14:56.698
Caption: in our brain and our neurons we have

00:14:54.778 --> 00:14:59.099
Caption: ions running around doing some similar

00:14:56.698 --> 00:15:01.259
Caption: stuff but basically it&#39;s a wiring system

00:14:59.099 --> 00:15:02.338
Caption: to make our information processing

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.898
Caption: happen

00:15:02.338 --> 00:15:06.179
Caption: so we&#39;re not shoeing there&#39;s any sort of

00:15:03.898 --> 00:15:08.159
Caption: ghost in the machine or souls or Spirits

00:15:06.179 --> 00:15:09.599
Caption: we&#39;re saying everything about us needs

00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:12.719
Caption: to be explained in terms of this

00:15:09.599 --> 00:15:16.259
Caption: biological information processing system

00:15:12.719 --> 00:15:18.838
Caption: and we want to try and do that now

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:21.059
Caption: so of course here&#39;s a physical system my

00:15:18.838 --> 00:15:23.578
Caption: son we can describe him in a physical

00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:24.838
Caption: state and physical laws

00:15:23.578 --> 00:15:27.239
Caption: now we&#39;re not interested in the whole

00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:28.619
Caption: body we&#39;re interested in just the brain

00:15:27.239 --> 00:15:30.599
Caption: so we can have a physical level

00:15:28.619 --> 00:15:32.940
Caption: description of the brain it&#39;s physical

00:15:30.599 --> 00:15:34.799
Caption: States and physical laws that say how

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.778
Caption: those States will change because of

00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:39.659
Caption: course the brain operates under the

00:15:36.778 --> 00:15:41.099
Caption: physical laws it can&#39;t break those laws

00:15:39.659 --> 00:15:42.719
Caption: but we want to have a look inside that

00:15:41.099 --> 00:15:44.518
Caption: and say hey what&#39;s inside the brain well

00:15:42.719 --> 00:15:46.259
Caption: there&#39;s these neuron things like the

00:15:44.518 --> 00:15:47.820
Caption: wiring and basically if you don&#39;t know

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.100
Caption: about it they have connections at the

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:52.380
Caption: end where other neurons connect to they

00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:54.359
Caption: add up all the symbols coming in if it

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.578
Caption: goes over a certain threshold then your

00:15:54.359 --> 00:15:58.619
Caption: neuron sends out a signal if it doesn&#39;t

00:15:56.578 --> 00:16:00.179
Caption: it stays pretty quiet

00:15:58.619 --> 00:16:01.380
Caption: so this is the sort of mathematical

00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:04.078
Caption: equation on the right but that&#39;s how

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.539
Caption: neurons look like inside our brain there

00:16:04.078 --> 00:16:08.099
Caption: are apparently 80 billion neurons

00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:09.299
Caption: it&#39;s down on we used to think it was a

00:16:08.099 --> 00:16:10.739
Caption: hundred billion but they did some more

00:16:09.299 --> 00:16:12.838
Caption: studies and we&#39;ve got 20 billion less

00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:14.820
Caption: but it doesn&#39;t make us any less smart we

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:16.919
Caption: can still do a lot with 80 billion

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:19.320
Caption: it&#39;s a complex network of these neurons

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:20.940
Caption: in the brain

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.979
Caption: so how do we look at this in terms of

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.359
Caption: computational systems

00:16:22.979 --> 00:16:25.919
Caption: the first thing is of course that

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:28.859
Caption: physical level description I mentioned

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:31.138
Caption: physical States and physical laws the

00:16:28.859 --> 00:16:32.458
Caption: brain obeys physics can&#39;t not obey

00:16:31.138 --> 00:16:35.159
Caption: physics

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:36.599
Caption: and it goes from state to state but now

00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:38.398
Caption: when it gets interesting we talk about

00:16:36.599 --> 00:16:40.380
Caption: the functional level description of the

00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:42.359
Caption: brain so we&#39;re going to abstract away

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.919
Caption: from those physical States

00:16:42.359 --> 00:16:46.320
Caption: and so let&#39;s look about let&#39;s talk about

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:48.479
Caption: the firing rate of a neuron not about

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.699
Caption: where all the ions and atoms are inside

00:16:48.479 --> 00:16:52.559
Caption: the neuron let&#39;s abstract away and we

00:16:50.698 --> 00:16:54.958
Caption: can say the neuron is firing at this

00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:56.880
Caption: rate or that rate or this rate or that

00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:58.198
Caption: weight it&#39;s usually a low rate or a high

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.880
Caption: rate

00:16:58.198 --> 00:17:02.518
Caption: and the way the actual brain is

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.380
Caption: configured is is sort of wired so it&#39;s

00:17:02.518 --> 00:17:07.078
Caption: functional specification is sort of like

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:09.418
Caption: the wiring of a computer circuits but

00:17:07.078 --> 00:17:11.099
Caption: now it&#39;s the wiring of these neurons

00:17:09.418 --> 00:17:13.019
Caption: so when we look at the brain we can

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:15.418
Caption: abstract over those physical States and

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.880
Caption: say this neuron here is firing or not

00:17:15.418 --> 00:17:19.619
Caption: firing that&#39;s the input and then the

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.418
Caption: output has some sort of rule set up

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:23.099
Caption: because of the configuration to be

00:17:21.418 --> 00:17:24.838
Caption: firing or not firing

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:26.578
Caption: so we&#39;re abstracting over the physical

00:17:24.838 --> 00:17:30.780
Caption: states to get a functional description

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:32.880
Caption: in terms of firing rates of the neurons

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.380
Caption: now as I say we&#39;re looking at simplified

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:39.119
Caption: systems here we&#39;re not going to actually

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:40.918
Caption: look at complex systems so it&#39;s more

00:17:39.119 --> 00:17:42.298
Caption: here just an input output we&#39;re not

00:17:40.918 --> 00:17:44.099
Caption: looking at the complexities of all parts

00:17:42.298 --> 00:17:46.260
Caption: of the brains just yet input and output

00:17:44.099 --> 00:17:49.339
Caption: so we&#39;re in a particular input State we

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.339
Caption: go to an output state

00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:53.579
Caption: um that&#39;s the symbolic oh sorry now look

00:17:51.538 --> 00:17:55.739
Caption: at the symbolic level description the

00:17:53.579 --> 00:17:57.239
Caption: symbolic level abstracts against above

00:17:55.739 --> 00:17:58.798
Caption: those firing rates

00:17:57.239 --> 00:18:01.798
Caption: so we don&#39;t care whether the firing

00:17:58.798 --> 00:18:04.199
Caption: weight is 10 firings per second or five

00:18:01.798 --> 00:18:06.899
Caption: firings per second if it&#39;s low that&#39;s

00:18:04.199 --> 00:18:10.019
Caption: considered a zero now if it&#39;s very high

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:12.539
Caption: firing rate 20 30 50 100 firings per

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.459
Caption: second then we consider it a one

00:18:12.538 --> 00:18:17.279
Caption: so we&#39;ve got this on and off switch

00:18:14.459 --> 00:18:19.079
Caption: again sort of like a bit but of course

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.580
Caption: neurons aren&#39;t bits they&#39;re very

00:18:19.079 --> 00:18:22.979
Caption: unreliable they tend to work in

00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:24.959
Caption: collections but for our abstraction here

00:18:22.979 --> 00:18:26.280
Caption: just think of them as a single bit in

00:18:24.959 --> 00:18:28.500
Caption: the brain

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.780
Caption: so the brain is configured to go from

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.579
Caption: symbolic state to symbolic State one

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.799
Caption: neuron turns on the other one turns off

00:18:32.579 --> 00:18:36.959
Caption: because of their connections we can

00:18:34.798 --> 00:18:38.880
Caption: ignore the details of all the firing and

00:18:36.959 --> 00:18:42.319
Caption: just think about these symbolic States

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.319
Caption: the higher level description

00:18:42.719 --> 00:18:47.099
Caption: so what about the semantic level well

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.660
Caption: now we can abstract again over those

00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:51.239
Caption: symbolic States

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.739
Caption: and say hey down the bottom here we have

00:18:51.239 --> 00:18:55.439
Caption: some inputs coming into the computer

00:18:52.739 --> 00:18:58.798
Caption: maybe the import is something like you

00:18:55.439 --> 00:19:00.058
Caption: see a cat or you hear a cat or you read

00:18:58.798 --> 00:19:02.579
Caption: the word cat

00:19:00.058 --> 00:19:05.459
Caption: you know lots of inputs lots of bits of

00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:08.399
Caption: firing in your brain when you see a cat

00:19:05.459 --> 00:19:10.798
Caption: that&#39;s the symbolic level seeing a cat

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:13.859
Caption: but up the top there we now have this

00:19:10.798 --> 00:19:15.599
Caption: semantic State oh we&#39;re seeing a cat

00:19:13.859 --> 00:19:18.178
Caption: we don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s this cat or

00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:20.280
Caption: that cat or how we see the cat our brain

00:19:18.178 --> 00:19:22.558
Caption: says we&#39;ll operate the same way no

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.820
Caption: matter what the different symbols are

00:19:22.558 --> 00:19:25.979
Caption: and what we&#39;re going to do in this

00:19:23.819 --> 00:19:27.538
Caption: simple case is announce the cat hey

00:19:25.979 --> 00:19:29.699
Caption: there&#39;s the cat

00:19:27.538 --> 00:19:31.979
Caption: but we also don&#39;t mind how we announced

00:19:29.699 --> 00:19:34.439
Caption: the cat we could say cat or we could

00:19:31.979 --> 00:19:36.839
Caption: write cat or we could shout cat

00:19:34.439 --> 00:19:39.359
Caption: again input goes to Output we don&#39;t care

00:19:36.839 --> 00:19:42.859
Caption: how the symbols work as long as it is

00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:42.859
Caption: consistent with this semantic level

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:48.119
Caption: that&#39;s the semantic level description

00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:49.859
Caption: of how the brain works see a cat you

00:19:48.119 --> 00:19:52.260
Caption: announce a cat

00:19:49.859 --> 00:19:54.839
Caption: just to make it clear on the left is our

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:57.719
Caption: input on the right is our output so we

00:19:54.839 --> 00:20:00.058
Caption: see this cat we shout cat

00:19:57.719 --> 00:20:01.678
Caption: but hey it could be a different cat it&#39;s

00:20:00.058 --> 00:20:04.500
Caption: a different symbol but the same

00:20:01.678 --> 00:20:06.839
Caption: semantics to us in our operation is that

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.058
Caption: it&#39;s just a cat so we&#39;ll say cat

00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:11.459
Caption: and of course you could say cat in Sign

00:20:09.058 --> 00:20:12.418
Caption: Language rather than saying cat it

00:20:11.459 --> 00:20:15.479
Caption: doesn&#39;t matter there&#39;s different

00:20:12.418 --> 00:20:17.279
Caption: symbolic operations are still equivalent

00:20:15.479 --> 00:20:18.839
Caption: enough we&#39;re announcing there&#39;s a cat

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.880
Caption: and it could be a whole lot of different

00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:23.219
Caption: cats and we could say things in

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.199
Caption: different ways and so forth so the

00:20:23.219 --> 00:20:27.178
Caption: semantic level describes this higher

00:20:25.199 --> 00:20:29.159
Caption: level you&#39;re seeing this concept of a

00:20:27.178 --> 00:20:31.319
Caption: cat and you&#39;re reacting to it in a

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.619
Caption: certain way

00:20:31.319 --> 00:20:36.538
Caption: so brains are computational systems they

00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:37.798
Caption: have those three levels of descriptions

00:20:36.538 --> 00:20:41.399
Caption: we talked about

00:20:37.798 --> 00:20:43.199
Caption: uh before symbolic and so forth

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.479
Caption: the functional level the symbolic level

00:20:43.199 --> 00:20:47.038
Caption: and the semantic level

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:50.400
Caption: and again these higher levels

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:53.399
Caption: abstractions are very useful

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.739
Caption: another example you see a fire

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:58.080
Caption: of course your action may be

00:20:55.739 --> 00:21:01.319
Caption: scream out fire

00:20:58.079 --> 00:21:04.019
Caption: but your conceptual semantic level could

00:21:01.319 --> 00:21:06.000
Caption: be if we see danger then sort of panic

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:08.280
Caption: or do something like that so it doesn&#39;t

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.660
Caption: matter to us whether we see the smoke we

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.940
Caption: still May shout fire

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.919
Caption: and it doesn&#39;t matter whether we see we

00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:16.079
Caption: shout fire we run away

00:21:13.918 --> 00:21:19.619
Caption: okay we&#39;re doing something equivalent

00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:21.779
Caption: action or dial 9-1-1 again at the

00:21:19.619 --> 00:21:23.699
Caption: semantic level the behavior is described

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:27.559
Caption: as you see a fire or you hear fire or

00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:27.558
Caption: whatever fire you panic or do something

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.918
Caption: so that&#39;s the semantic level description

00:21:30.058 --> 00:21:33.538
Caption: of the brain

00:21:31.918 --> 00:21:34.979
Caption: now if we say your brain is a

00:21:33.538 --> 00:21:36.839
Caption: computational system and I hope you&#39;re

00:21:34.979 --> 00:21:38.400
Caption: sort of convinced a bit there

00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:40.500
Caption: the key thing to note here that it

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.820
Caption: explains everything but it also explains

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.739
Caption: nothing

00:21:41.819 --> 00:21:45.719
Caption: what does it explain well it explains

00:21:43.739 --> 00:21:47.219
Caption: what type of system the brain is it&#39;s a

00:21:45.719 --> 00:21:49.798
Caption: computational system

00:21:47.219 --> 00:21:51.538
Caption: that&#39;s really important it explained how

00:21:49.798 --> 00:21:53.038
Caption: the human behave Behavior works we have

00:21:51.538 --> 00:21:54.599
Caption: these different levels which abstract

00:21:53.038 --> 00:21:56.219
Caption: over each other

00:21:54.599 --> 00:21:58.140
Caption: and it provides an operational

00:21:56.219 --> 00:22:00.359
Caption: definition of meaning

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.280
Caption: what is the meaning of the cat it&#39;s all

00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:04.439
Caption: these different symbolic behaviors which

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.599
Caption: are equivalent to that we&#39;re abstracting

00:22:04.439 --> 00:22:08.759
Caption: over the set of symbols

00:22:06.599 --> 00:22:11.099
Caption: that&#39;s very important things it doesn&#39;t

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.780
Caption: explain it doesn&#39;t tell us the complete

00:22:11.099 --> 00:22:14.280
Caption: wiring of the brain

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.900
Caption: still working that out trying to

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.039
Caption: understand the functional architecture

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.799
Caption: of the brain

00:22:17.038 --> 00:22:21.599
Caption: and it doesn&#39;t explain how brains learn

00:22:19.798 --> 00:22:22.739
Caption: which is a very important thing we&#39;ll

00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:25.140
Caption: see soon

00:22:22.739 --> 00:22:27.319
Caption: calculators don&#39;t learn but brains do

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.320
Caption: learn

00:22:27.659 --> 00:22:31.320
Caption: so let&#39;s talk a bit about now how we

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.960
Caption: could maybe Implement a mind which is

00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:35.099
Caption: the running program of a brain and there

00:22:33.959 --> 00:22:36.719
Caption: are two different approaches the

00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:38.880
Caption: classical approach old-fashioned

00:22:36.719 --> 00:22:41.158
Caption: approach which was classical AI you may

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.380
Caption: have heard of expert systems these were

00:22:41.159 --> 00:22:45.900
Caption: symbol systems they worked with symbols

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.940
Caption: like cat and dog and produced responses

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.099
Caption: like say hello or whatever

00:22:47.939 --> 00:22:52.319
Caption: and now these new connectionist ones or

00:22:50.099 --> 00:22:54.178
Caption: neural network approaches these were

00:22:52.319 --> 00:22:56.219
Caption: different they were sort of lower level

00:22:54.178 --> 00:22:59.038
Caption: I want to explain how they differ in

00:22:56.219 --> 00:23:00.719
Caption: terms of this computational model

00:22:59.038 --> 00:23:02.939
Caption: so first of all we said that a classical

00:23:00.719 --> 00:23:05.158
Caption: digital computer and a brain are both

00:23:02.939 --> 00:23:06.899
Caption: computational systems they both have

00:23:05.159 --> 00:23:10.080
Caption: three different levels symbolic and

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.460
Caption: semantic they&#39;re similar in that way but

00:23:10.079 --> 00:23:13.500
Caption: how are they different a classical

00:23:11.459 --> 00:23:16.619
Caption: digital computer

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:19.380
Caption: the difference is this when we program a

00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:20.880
Caption: classical digital computer we program at

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:24.298
Caption: the symbolic level

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:26.760
Caption: so the computer wiring is set up for us

00:23:24.298 --> 00:23:29.038
Caption: and we program by saying here comes the

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.079
Caption: symbolic the symbols and the rules which

00:23:29.038 --> 00:23:32.699
Caption: will say how those symbol change which

00:23:31.079 --> 00:23:34.859
Caption: is your code

00:23:32.699 --> 00:23:36.000
Caption: but the mind doesn&#39;t have a program at

00:23:34.859 --> 00:23:38.038
Caption: the symbol level

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.400
Caption: is the only program that the functional

00:23:38.038 --> 00:23:43.259
Caption: level the wiring that the gene specified

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.719
Caption: so where do the symbols come from in the

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.940
Caption: brain they&#39;re actually learned

00:23:45.719 --> 00:23:49.678
Caption: these symbols and the rules which say

00:23:47.939 --> 00:23:52.199
Caption: how they move from one to the other your

00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:53.819
Caption: behavior actually emerges as you learn

00:23:52.199 --> 00:23:56.819
Caption: and watch the environment

00:23:53.819 --> 00:23:59.219
Caption: and the semantics emerge as well

00:23:56.819 --> 00:24:00.298
Caption: so the symbols emerge and the semantics

00:23:59.219 --> 00:24:03.239
Caption: emerge

00:24:00.298 --> 00:24:05.760
Caption: this raises a big question for me our

00:24:03.239 --> 00:24:07.339
Caption: minds touring equivalent

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.558
Caption: we&#39;ve have a look on the left hand side

00:24:07.339 --> 00:24:12.119
Caption: and classical AI the symbols there will

00:24:10.558 --> 00:24:14.219
Caption: match the symbols in a turing machine

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:15.900
Caption: yes it&#39;s like a turing machine

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:18.538
Caption: but on the right hand side when we start

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:20.039
Caption: off with a mind there are no symbols and

00:24:18.538 --> 00:24:22.259
Caption: these symbols emerge and they&#39;re

00:24:20.038 --> 00:24:24.479
Caption: continuously changing and the rules are

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.798
Caption: emerging and changing but a turing

00:24:24.479 --> 00:24:28.199
Caption: machine says we have these particular

00:24:25.798 --> 00:24:30.178
Caption: symbols and these rules

00:24:28.199 --> 00:24:32.819
Caption: I claim that&#39;s not really a turing

00:24:30.178 --> 00:24:34.380
Caption: machine equivalent because it&#39;s defining

00:24:32.819 --> 00:24:37.038
Caption: and emerging symbols rather than having

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.039
Caption: them specified

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.619
Caption: but how do we actually

00:24:38.699 --> 00:24:42.538
Caption: um well the similarities now between a

00:24:40.619 --> 00:24:45.298
Caption: neural network type solution a

00:24:42.538 --> 00:24:47.939
Caption: connectionist Ai and the mind when we

00:24:45.298 --> 00:24:49.558
Caption: set up neural networks with AWS or your

00:24:47.939 --> 00:24:51.839
Caption: own programming you&#39;re basically

00:24:49.558 --> 00:24:53.640
Caption: specifying the functional level how

00:24:51.839 --> 00:24:56.339
Caption: these artificial neurons are connected

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.500
Caption: and then it tries to learn so it learns

00:24:56.339 --> 00:24:59.760
Caption: symbols I can recognize a cat and say

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.439
Caption: cat

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.320
Caption: so it&#39;s very similar to the Mind

00:25:01.439 --> 00:25:06.359
Caption: specified at the functional level

00:25:04.319 --> 00:25:08.399
Caption: now when we&#39;re trying to implement one

00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:09.959
Caption: of these artificial neural networks at

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.520
Caption: the functional level how can we

00:25:09.959 --> 00:25:14.038
Caption: implement it well we could make our own

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:17.700
Caption: neurons but we tend to like to use a

00:25:14.038 --> 00:25:20.879
Caption: classical computer to implement a neural

00:25:17.699 --> 00:25:22.439
Caption: network and run it how does that work

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.599
Caption: this shows you how what actually happens

00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:27.178
Caption: here what actually happens we use a

00:25:24.599 --> 00:25:28.199
Caption: classical computer program a symbolic

00:25:27.178 --> 00:25:31.019
Caption: system

00:25:28.199 --> 00:25:34.139
Caption: so you write some code but the code you

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:36.000
Caption: write the symbols in your program are

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.919
Caption: not equivalent to the symbols in the

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.959
Caption: mind or the connection of system

00:25:37.918 --> 00:25:42.658
Caption: the symbols you use in your program

00:25:39.959 --> 00:25:45.658
Caption: match the functional level

00:25:42.659 --> 00:25:47.880
Caption: of the connection of system so you&#39;re

00:25:45.659 --> 00:25:50.640
Caption: using your symbols to say specify the

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.260
Caption: firing rate of the neurons not the

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.479
Caption: symbols themselves

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.520
Caption: so we&#39;re using symbols at a different

00:25:54.479 --> 00:25:58.380
Caption: level that&#39;s why they&#39;re not equivalent

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.619
Caption: so we can Implement these connection

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.479
Caption: systems in classical AI symbol systems

00:26:01.619 --> 00:26:06.859
Caption: but we&#39;re implementing them by

00:26:03.479 --> 00:26:06.859
Caption: implementing their functional level

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.719
Caption: okay so this is what the conclusion of

00:26:10.619 --> 00:26:14.760
Caption: my sort of research was my PhD and so

00:26:12.719 --> 00:26:16.020
Caption: forth there are two different types of

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.298
Caption: computation

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:20.760
Caption: there&#39;s what I call discrete computation

00:26:18.298 --> 00:26:22.558
Caption: this is where you specify in your

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.900
Caption: program everything up to the symbol

00:26:22.558 --> 00:26:27.538
Caption: level so you write the program in terms

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:30.719
Caption: of symbols to Define some semantic level

00:26:27.538 --> 00:26:33.778
Caption: you&#39;re writing some calculator code to

00:26:30.719 --> 00:26:36.658
Caption: make a calculator Implement mathematics

00:26:33.779 --> 00:26:39.059
Caption: discrete because the rules are chunky if

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:40.380
Caption: this then that the symbols are precise

00:26:39.058 --> 00:26:43.859
Caption: and static

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:46.020
Caption: I call it discrete computation

00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:48.239
Caption: the brain however as I&#39;ve tried to imply

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:50.700
Caption: to you here is different I call it

00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:52.798
Caption: continuous computation because again

00:26:50.699 --> 00:26:54.298
Caption: it&#39;s only specify that the physical and

00:26:52.798 --> 00:26:57.839
Caption: the functional level

00:26:54.298 --> 00:26:59.819
Caption: the symbols and the semantics emerge as

00:26:57.839 --> 00:27:01.678
Caption: a result of learning I&#39;m trying to show

00:26:59.819 --> 00:27:04.619
Caption: you there the wiggly symbols rather than

00:27:01.678 --> 00:27:06.418
Caption: square boxes preset values the symbols

00:27:04.619 --> 00:27:08.279
Caption: emerge and your definition or

00:27:06.418 --> 00:27:11.038
Caption: understanding or operational Behavior

00:27:08.279 --> 00:27:13.440
Caption: with regards to cats change as you learn

00:27:11.038 --> 00:27:15.599
Caption: about cats and you see more cats your

00:27:13.439 --> 00:27:17.399
Caption: brain always changes and the phys and

00:27:15.599 --> 00:27:19.678
Caption: the symbols and the rules are in

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.919
Caption: continuous Dynamic flux in evolving

00:27:19.678 --> 00:27:24.899
Caption: continuously so continuous computational

00:27:22.918 --> 00:27:26.519
Caption: systems

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.380
Caption: so there we go

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.219
Caption: um I hope I&#39;ve shown you or given you an

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.859
Caption: idea

00:27:29.219 --> 00:27:34.500
Caption: that I&#39;m a computer a computational

00:27:31.859 --> 00:27:37.739
Caption: system and you are too

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.959
Caption: but to be more precise about this

00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:42.538
Caption: um I&#39;m a continuous computational system

00:27:39.959 --> 00:27:44.520
Caption: and you are too so we&#39;re not like a

00:27:42.538 --> 00:27:46.739
Caption: classical computer program with symbols

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.900
Caption: where I could computate a continuous

00:27:46.739 --> 00:27:51.058
Caption: computational system with emerging

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.200
Caption: symbols and emerging rules and emerging

00:27:51.058 --> 00:27:53.640
Caption: semantics

00:27:52.199 --> 00:27:55.859
Caption: and of course the learning has to be

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.640
Caption: good to ensure we actually emerge and

00:27:55.859 --> 00:27:58.640
Caption: learn things properly

00:27:58.859 --> 00:28:03.418
Caption: okay so um that leads us to the big

00:28:01.678 --> 00:28:06.058
Caption: question now what is I unless we can get

00:28:03.418 --> 00:28:09.119
Caption: some audience participation in this one

00:28:06.058 --> 00:28:10.140
Caption: so what is I well what are we there&#39;s a

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:11.819
Caption: lot of things that people talk about

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.678
Caption: when they talk about I

00:28:11.819 --> 00:28:15.178
Caption: they talk about

00:28:13.678 --> 00:28:18.119
Caption: um awareness

00:28:15.178 --> 00:28:19.619
Caption: self-awareness free will

00:28:18.119 --> 00:28:21.239
Caption: qualia if you don&#39;t know what that means

00:28:19.619 --> 00:28:22.739
Caption: we&#39;ll explain it in a second and

00:28:21.239 --> 00:28:24.359
Caption: consciousness of course

00:28:22.739 --> 00:28:27.058
Caption: these are the big questions the

00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:28.918
Caption: Consciousness one is called a CLM career

00:28:27.058 --> 00:28:31.380
Caption: limiting move if you start to research

00:28:28.918 --> 00:28:33.658
Caption: in Consciousness then your chances of

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.099
Caption: success and getting a good promotion and

00:28:33.659 --> 00:28:36.840
Caption: so forth are very low

00:28:35.099 --> 00:28:38.278
Caption: although becoming more popular these

00:28:36.839 --> 00:28:40.619
Caption: days people doing a lot of research in

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:42.240
Caption: it so what do all these mean in

00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:44.959
Caption: particular with regards to computational

00:28:42.239 --> 00:28:44.959
Caption: systems

00:28:45.119 --> 00:28:48.359
Caption: the first one awareness I think is quite

00:28:47.099 --> 00:28:49.918
Caption: easy if you think about it

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:52.140
Caption: computationally

00:28:49.918 --> 00:28:53.579
Caption: if you&#39;re aware of something say in your

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.339
Caption: environment

00:28:53.579 --> 00:28:59.339
Caption: it basically means you show consistent

00:28:56.339 --> 00:29:00.839
Caption: and appropriate behavior with respect to

00:28:59.339 --> 00:29:02.579
Caption: perceptions of it

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:04.918
Caption: so for example if I&#39;m aware of this

00:29:02.579 --> 00:29:07.619
Caption: microphone I know not to touch it and I

00:29:04.918 --> 00:29:09.298
Caption: know if I need to touch it my symbols

00:29:07.619 --> 00:29:11.819
Caption: are working properly in a nice

00:29:09.298 --> 00:29:13.918
Caption: semantically consistent way but if I

00:29:11.819 --> 00:29:14.939
Caption: aren&#39;t aware of that microphone and I

00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:16.918
Caption: bump it

00:29:14.939 --> 00:29:19.139
Caption: I haven&#39;t been aware of it my system

00:29:16.918 --> 00:29:20.219
Caption: symbols and so forth wasn&#39;t aware of

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.380
Caption: that

00:29:20.219 --> 00:29:24.479
Caption: so my behavior to it wasn&#39;t appropriate

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.558
Caption: or successful in terms of what I was

00:29:24.479 --> 00:29:27.839
Caption: doing

00:29:25.558 --> 00:29:29.339
Caption: similar with seeing objects other

00:29:27.839 --> 00:29:32.038
Caption: objects in the world

00:29:29.339 --> 00:29:34.380
Caption: so awareness is about really having some

00:29:32.038 --> 00:29:36.359
Caption: computational semantics which are

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:38.760
Caption: appropriate for the things you&#39;re trying

00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:40.020
Caption: to be aware of are these three levels

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.820
Caption: there

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.799
Caption: now there&#39;s a classic example of where

00:29:41.819 --> 00:29:46.259
Caption: this goes wrong there&#39;s a famous book

00:29:43.798 --> 00:29:48.418
Caption: and research says the man who mistook

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.039
Caption: his wife for a hat he had a brain

00:29:48.418 --> 00:29:52.079
Caption: disorder when he thought his wife&#39;s head

00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:53.879
Caption: was a hat and was trying to put it on

00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:55.979
Caption: very sad of course

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:58.020
Caption: but I hope you see what this means it

00:29:55.979 --> 00:30:00.119
Caption: means it hasn&#39;t got the right symbols

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:02.039
Caption: and the right semantics for the hat so

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:04.678
Caption: the behavior is inappropriate

00:30:02.038 --> 00:30:07.199
Caption: so it&#39;s failed so he hasn&#39;t really got

00:30:04.678 --> 00:30:08.939
Caption: this awareness of a hat for what it

00:30:07.199 --> 00:30:10.859
Caption: really is it hasn&#39;t got the

00:30:08.939 --> 00:30:12.058
Caption: computational levels set up and working

00:30:10.859 --> 00:30:13.739
Caption: correctly

00:30:12.058 --> 00:30:16.859
Caption: true story you can read about that a

00:30:13.739 --> 00:30:18.839
Caption: book by Oliver Oliver Sacks

00:30:16.859 --> 00:30:20.459
Caption: what about self-awareness

00:30:18.839 --> 00:30:22.079
Caption: well it&#39;s the same sort of thing but as

00:30:20.459 --> 00:30:23.699
Caption: you go through life of course you see

00:30:22.079 --> 00:30:25.678
Caption: your body with you it&#39;s all around there

00:30:23.699 --> 00:30:27.538
Caption: and you start to behave consistently

00:30:25.678 --> 00:30:30.479
Caption: with regards to your body

00:30:27.538 --> 00:30:31.859
Caption: so you&#39;re aware of yourself being with

00:30:30.479 --> 00:30:33.719
Caption: you all the time

00:30:31.859 --> 00:30:35.640
Caption: self-awareness is consistent and

00:30:33.719 --> 00:30:37.859
Caption: appropriate behavior with respect to

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:40.500
Caption: internal and external perceptions of

00:30:37.859 --> 00:30:41.760
Caption: yourself so I see this thing here and

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.380
Caption: I&#39;m set up correctly I&#39;ve learned

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.539
Caption: correctly this is my hand it&#39;s not

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:48.418
Caption: someone else&#39;s hand right and I know I

00:30:45.538 --> 00:30:50.219
Caption: can control it and do things with it

00:30:48.418 --> 00:30:53.099
Caption: as I mentioned here it&#39;s not just

00:30:50.219 --> 00:30:55.260
Caption: external stuff when you talk externally

00:30:53.099 --> 00:30:57.000
Caption: you can hear yourself but also we have

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.739
Caption: this Loop going on in our head where we

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.619
Caption: can actually hear ourself we can talk

00:30:58.739 --> 00:31:03.959
Caption: internally our mental dialogue this is

00:31:01.619 --> 00:31:06.000
Caption: an example of a computational system as

00:31:03.959 --> 00:31:07.678
Caption: well are you responding to your thoughts

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.880
Caption: appropriately with new thoughts and so

00:31:07.678 --> 00:31:11.640
Caption: forth

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.760
Caption: so again computational awareness of your

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:16.020
Caption: environment and awareness of yourself

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:18.199
Caption: self-awareness I think they&#39;re not too

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.200
Caption: hard

00:31:18.479 --> 00:31:22.739
Caption: when it gets more difficult or a bit

00:31:20.099 --> 00:31:24.778
Caption: more difficult is free will

00:31:22.739 --> 00:31:26.038
Caption: okay so everyone says what is Free Will

00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:28.500
Caption: and whatever and they have all these

00:31:26.038 --> 00:31:30.359
Caption: ideas and we need some soul or Spirit to

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.979
Caption: make us be able to make decisions

00:31:30.359 --> 00:31:33.538
Caption: when I come down to it I think it&#39;s

00:31:31.979 --> 00:31:35.219
Caption: pretty easy

00:31:33.538 --> 00:31:37.859
Caption: what is free will

00:31:35.219 --> 00:31:40.798
Caption: Free Will is making decisions and taking

00:31:37.859 --> 00:31:44.459
Caption: actions based upon your current inputs

00:31:40.798 --> 00:31:46.678
Caption: and your past experience

00:31:44.459 --> 00:31:48.479
Caption: okay what else could it be

00:31:46.678 --> 00:31:49.979
Caption: all right so you&#39;re making a sin you ask

00:31:48.479 --> 00:31:52.079
Caption: me now what do you want for lunch lamb

00:31:49.979 --> 00:31:53.939
Caption: or fish something&#39;s happening in my

00:31:52.079 --> 00:31:56.158
Caption: brain based upon the inputs you gave me

00:31:53.939 --> 00:31:58.319
Caption: and the experience I have some processes

00:31:56.159 --> 00:32:00.000
Caption: going along to actually produce a result

00:31:58.319 --> 00:32:03.778
Caption: I want fish

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.159
Caption: okay that&#39;s what free will is we&#39;re

00:32:03.779 --> 00:32:07.799
Caption: making again it&#39;s a mechanical

00:32:05.159 --> 00:32:10.200
Caption: mechanical biological machine making a

00:32:07.798 --> 00:32:11.939
Caption: decision nothing fancy there

00:32:10.199 --> 00:32:13.979
Caption: now it does mean somewhat that we&#39;re

00:32:11.939 --> 00:32:16.019
Caption: deterministic which people all don&#39;t

00:32:13.979 --> 00:32:17.339
Caption: feel I can&#39;t make my own decisions or

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.959
Caption: how do you make your decisions you make

00:32:17.339 --> 00:32:22.979
Caption: them based on current inputs and your

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:24.418
Caption: past experience what else could you want

00:32:22.979 --> 00:32:25.500
Caption: and don&#39;t worry even though it is

00:32:24.418 --> 00:32:27.359
Caption: deterministic there&#39;s lots of

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.339
Caption: non-linearity in the system lots of

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:30.658
Caption: noise and Quantum indeterminacy you

00:32:29.339 --> 00:32:31.859
Caption: could never predict what someone&#39;s going

00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:34.740
Caption: to say or do

00:32:31.859 --> 00:32:36.538
Caption: at that sort of level

00:32:34.739 --> 00:32:37.500
Caption: so free will I think is also not

00:32:36.538 --> 00:32:39.839
Caption: difficult

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:42.000
Caption: where things get very difficult

00:32:39.839 --> 00:32:42.959
Caption: is when we talk about qualia

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.880
Caption: I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard about

00:32:42.959 --> 00:32:47.459
Caption: qualia but it&#39;s the philosophical

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:50.399
Caption: content uh philosophical concept of

00:32:47.459 --> 00:32:52.678
Caption: what&#39;s it like to

00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:54.840
Caption: so we can behave consistently with

00:32:52.678 --> 00:32:57.119
Caption: respect to things there&#39;s a certain

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:59.398
Caption: difference when you feel what it&#39;s like

00:32:57.119 --> 00:33:01.380
Caption: to do something or see something

00:32:59.399 --> 00:33:03.239
Caption: that&#39;s what I want to talk about now

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.918
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk about what&#39;s it like

00:33:03.239 --> 00:33:07.798
Caption: to feel pain

00:33:04.918 --> 00:33:09.298
Caption: what&#39;s it like to see and what&#39;s it like

00:33:07.798 --> 00:33:11.639
Caption: to see red

00:33:09.298 --> 00:33:13.439
Caption: and we&#39;ll try and see no pun intended

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.000
Caption: whether these things relate to the

00:33:13.439 --> 00:33:18.259
Caption: computational approach we&#39;ve looked at

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.260
Caption: for the human mind

00:33:18.359 --> 00:33:21.658
Caption: so this is where we have to ask the

00:33:19.859 --> 00:33:23.099
Caption: audio of the control to please lock the

00:33:21.659 --> 00:33:25.260
Caption: doors we can do some experiment with

00:33:23.099 --> 00:33:27.119
Caption: pain and we ask any are there any

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.320
Caption: volunteers here who want to experience

00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:31.019
Caption: some pain

00:33:28.319 --> 00:33:34.439
Caption: no volunteers so everyone can do it

00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:35.220
Caption: all right so I promise some pain so get

00:33:34.439 --> 00:33:37.379
Caption: ready

00:33:35.219 --> 00:33:39.178
Caption: what I want you to do please get your

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.859
Caption: arms all limbered up get your arms free

00:33:39.178 --> 00:33:44.158
Caption: put your phones down

00:33:40.859 --> 00:33:45.298
Caption: I want you to pinch yourself on your arm

00:33:44.159 --> 00:33:47.640
Caption: somewhere

00:33:45.298 --> 00:33:49.739
Caption: pinch very hard not too hard don&#39;t make

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:52.380
Caption: some damage but so you can feel it see

00:33:49.739 --> 00:33:54.719
Caption: that word there feel it

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.819
Caption: okay so you pinched your arm what

00:33:54.719 --> 00:33:59.038
Caption: happened then

00:33:56.819 --> 00:34:01.199
Caption: the question is where is the pain you

00:33:59.038 --> 00:34:02.759
Caption: felt something pain but where is the

00:34:01.199 --> 00:34:04.079
Caption: pain and most of the time you say oh

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.399
Caption: yeah it&#39;s in my arm I can feel me

00:34:04.079 --> 00:34:08.219
Caption: pinching there

00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:09.719
Caption: but remember what&#39;s happening here all

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:11.760
Caption: that&#39;s happening is there&#39;s a detector

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:14.219
Caption: there which is sending an electrical

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.560
Caption: signal up to your brain so when it gets

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:19.378
Caption: to your brain it&#39;s just a on or off

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.599
Caption: there&#39;s no pain in that signal

00:34:19.378 --> 00:34:23.338
Caption: so where does the pain come from

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:25.260
Caption: it&#39;s not in your arm

00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:28.260
Caption: the pain is in your mind

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.580
Caption: your mind is constructing this pain

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.739
Caption: for a good reason of course because

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.179
Caption: maybe you&#39;re got a knife on your arm or

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:34.439
Caption: you&#39;re pinching too hard or sofa that

00:34:33.178 --> 00:34:38.300
Caption: wants to stop you

00:34:34.439 --> 00:34:38.300
Caption: but you&#39;re feeling this pain

00:34:38.638 --> 00:34:43.079
Caption: so pain is constructed in the mind quite

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.719
Caption: interesting to think about all right

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:48.479
Caption: another expect experiment what does it

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:49.918
Caption: feel like to see red or what does red

00:34:48.479 --> 00:34:51.719
Caption: feel like

00:34:49.918 --> 00:34:53.398
Caption: so the question here is to look at

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:54.479
Caption: something red

00:34:53.398 --> 00:34:56.760
Caption: I don&#39;t know if you can see something

00:34:54.479 --> 00:34:59.459
Caption: red around anyone got some red on if not

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.080
Caption: we can look at this

00:34:59.459 --> 00:35:03.179
Caption: so look at this Red Dot and think what

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.219
Caption: is it it feels like something to look at

00:35:03.179 --> 00:35:06.598
Caption: Red doesn&#39;t it feels like red

00:35:05.219 --> 00:35:08.159
Caption: what does that mean

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:10.260
Caption: remember what&#39;s happening here it&#39;s just

00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:12.358
Caption: electrical signals in your brain but

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.820
Caption: somehow your brain is constructing this

00:35:12.358 --> 00:35:16.919
Caption: thing that it feels like red

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.839
Caption: this is a big puzzle this is the qualia

00:35:16.919 --> 00:35:21.838
Caption: pubble puzzle what does it mean to feel

00:35:18.839 --> 00:35:23.400
Caption: like or to see red

00:35:21.839 --> 00:35:25.980
Caption: now a lot of the answers possible

00:35:23.399 --> 00:35:27.899
Caption: answers to this but another thing here

00:35:25.979 --> 00:35:29.520
Caption: and my hypothesis is when you&#39;re sitting

00:35:27.899 --> 00:35:31.439
Caption: back and you&#39;re looking at red

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:34.739
Caption: what you&#39;re actually doing is behaving

00:35:31.439 --> 00:35:36.598
Caption: in a way consistent with all the states

00:35:34.739 --> 00:35:37.739
Caption: of different Reds and you&#39;re giving that

00:35:36.599 --> 00:35:39.839
Caption: a label doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s

00:35:37.739 --> 00:35:43.560
Caption: light red or dark red or this shade of

00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:45.720
Caption: red your semantics are this is red

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.339
Caption: so you&#39;re identifying it as red and

00:35:45.719 --> 00:35:49.260
Caption: you&#39;re saying I&#39;m feeling red when I&#39;m

00:35:47.339 --> 00:35:51.060
Caption: looking at that

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.679
Caption: again it comes to this computational

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.939
Caption: approach to different levels up to

00:35:52.679 --> 00:35:56.219
Caption: semantics it doesn&#39;t matter what the

00:35:53.939 --> 00:35:58.379
Caption: symbol is different types of red the

00:35:56.219 --> 00:36:00.540
Caption: semantics it&#39;s red and you&#39;re responding

00:35:58.379 --> 00:36:03.000
Caption: to the fact yes I&#39;m seeing red it&#39;s a

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:04.919
Caption: red thing and it feels like red

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.239
Caption: not totally convincing that I don&#39;t know

00:36:04.919 --> 00:36:07.858
Caption: if you don&#39;t believe me on that I&#39;m not

00:36:06.239 --> 00:36:10.139
Caption: totally convinced yet but that&#39;s the the

00:36:07.858 --> 00:36:12.179
Caption: feeling I have

00:36:10.139 --> 00:36:14.299
Caption: gets a bit weirder what about black when

00:36:12.179 --> 00:36:16.679
Caption: you close when you um don&#39;t see anything

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:18.300
Caption: it looks black but why does it look why

00:36:16.679 --> 00:36:20.459
Caption: does it feel black

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.739
Caption: why could it be white

00:36:20.459 --> 00:36:23.879
Caption: you know what what defines something as

00:36:22.739 --> 00:36:27.000
Caption: white or you say what&#39;s because there&#39;s

00:36:23.879 --> 00:36:28.799
Caption: lots of light but we&#39;re looking at it we

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.118
Caption: see it&#39;s white but what why couldn&#39;t we

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.040
Caption: see it as black

00:36:30.118 --> 00:36:34.078
Caption: it&#39;s almost arbitrary whether you have

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:36.599
Caption: white or black

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:38.160
Caption: when we feel it to be white or black but

00:36:36.599 --> 00:36:39.960
Caption: of course we need something to be able

00:36:38.159 --> 00:36:41.399
Caption: to distinguish them so these are what

00:36:39.959 --> 00:36:43.078
Caption: we&#39;ve basically got

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:44.639
Caption: I think you could swap them around and

00:36:43.079 --> 00:36:46.140
Caption: everything would still work fine it

00:36:44.639 --> 00:36:49.578
Caption: would be a sort of negative color system

00:36:46.139 --> 00:36:49.578
Caption: rather than a positive color system

00:36:49.618 --> 00:36:52.319
Caption: so this brings us to the last little

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.500
Caption: experiment

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:57.900
Caption: what it feels like to see

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.060
Caption: and this experiment is important

00:36:57.899 --> 00:37:01.858
Caption: please close your eyes

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:03.180
Caption: when closing their eyes and hopefully

00:37:01.858 --> 00:37:05.039
Caption: you can&#39;t see anything it&#39;s pretty dark

00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:06.059
Caption: although I may see some white spots and

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.739
Caption: so forth

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.820
Caption: and at the count of three I want you to

00:37:07.739 --> 00:37:12.780
Caption: open your eyes

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:15.239
Caption: one two three

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:17.339
Caption: now you&#39;re seeing here right you&#39;re

00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:19.560
Caption: experiencing you can feel what it looks

00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:21.480
Caption: like to see

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.719
Caption: now the really important Point here is

00:37:21.479 --> 00:37:26.579
Caption: your behavior could be consistent with

00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:29.280
Caption: seeing I could notice this microphones

00:37:26.579 --> 00:37:31.680
Caption: here and act appropriately but it&#39;s

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.839
Caption: almost like a step up to say yes I&#39;m

00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:36.300
Caption: behaving consistently but it actually

00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:38.040
Caption: feels like something to see

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:40.260
Caption: and that&#39;s the tricky point about this

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.959
Caption: quality it feels more like more than

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:45.300
Caption: just behaving consistently

00:37:42.959 --> 00:37:47.459
Caption: of course when you think about it you go

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:49.920
Caption: from black to seeing something

00:37:47.459 --> 00:37:51.419
Caption: really you know about what happens in

00:37:49.919 --> 00:37:52.799
Caption: there we ask the question what does it

00:37:51.419 --> 00:37:55.078
Caption: mean to see everyone will give you a

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.179
Caption: description of yes we have the the image

00:37:55.079 --> 00:37:59.099
Caption: coming through the up the um the lenses

00:37:57.179 --> 00:38:00.899
Caption: in the eyes it&#39;s sort of inverted it

00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:02.820
Caption: goes into the back of the brain

00:38:00.899 --> 00:38:05.639
Caption: that&#39;s just like the wire coming up your

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:07.739
Caption: arm it&#39;s not really important because at

00:38:05.639 --> 00:38:09.779
Caption: the end it&#39;s just electrical signals at

00:38:07.739 --> 00:38:11.520
Caption: the back of your brain how does your

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.979
Caption: brain turn those electrical signal tools

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.140
Caption: into this experience that I feel like

00:38:13.979 --> 00:38:18.780
Caption: I&#39;m seeing things it&#39;s more than just

00:38:16.139 --> 00:38:21.299
Caption: behaving consistently so we have this

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.900
Caption: but how do we get the fact that yes I&#39;m

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.900
Caption: seeing something

00:38:24.959 --> 00:38:28.439
Caption: similarly we can look at bats bats are a

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.119
Caption: bit different of course they don&#39;t look

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:31.560
Caption: with a normal sight they use

00:38:30.118 --> 00:38:34.019
Caption: echolocation

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.420
Caption: so what&#39;s it like to see as a bat

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:38.399
Caption: we don&#39;t really know is it like that or

00:38:36.419 --> 00:38:41.098
Caption: do they see it more like we&#39;d guess you

00:38:38.399 --> 00:38:42.838
Caption: know closer things are brighter

00:38:41.099 --> 00:38:44.880
Caption: a different way of perceiving the world

00:38:42.839 --> 00:38:48.359
Caption: what does it feel like to be in Bat is a

00:38:44.879 --> 00:38:50.219
Caption: question that philosophers often ask

00:38:48.358 --> 00:38:51.719
Caption: okay the last one here is tricking its

00:38:50.219 --> 00:38:52.760
Caption: Consciousness and I&#39;m running out of

00:38:51.719 --> 00:38:55.199
Caption: time

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.939
Caption: we&#39;ve mentioned all these things so

00:38:55.199 --> 00:38:59.098
Caption: Consciousness is often involved with all

00:38:56.939 --> 00:39:02.040
Caption: of these but there&#39;s something more than

00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:03.480
Caption: just behaving consistently

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:06.660
Caption: um people suggest that Consciousness

00:39:03.479 --> 00:39:08.520
Caption: could live in the microtubules of the

00:39:06.659 --> 00:39:10.858
Caption: neurons these very small things inside

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.599
Caption: the neurons I think that&#39;s just putting

00:39:10.858 --> 00:39:14.219
Caption: the problem down a level

00:39:12.599 --> 00:39:16.020
Caption: others think that it could be due to

00:39:14.219 --> 00:39:17.820
Caption: with quantum mechanics we need quantum

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.919
Caption: mechanics to be conscious

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.599
Caption: I think that&#39;s just again putting the

00:39:19.919 --> 00:39:23.578
Caption: issue away we know we&#39;re a biological

00:39:21.599 --> 00:39:25.380
Caption: system the Consciousness didn&#39;t come in

00:39:23.579 --> 00:39:27.359
Caption: there because of quantum mechanics it

00:39:25.379 --> 00:39:29.279
Caption: came through evolution

00:39:27.358 --> 00:39:32.519
Caption: and the last one says well maybe the

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.599
Caption: world consists of space and time yes we

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.880
Caption: agree

00:39:33.599 --> 00:39:37.859
Caption: energy and matter yes that&#39;s the

00:39:35.879 --> 00:39:40.618
Caption: universe but now maybe there&#39;s a third

00:39:37.858 --> 00:39:42.000
Caption: thing called consciousness and a lot of

00:39:40.618 --> 00:39:44.039
Caption: physicists now are believing this

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.139
Caption: because they couldn&#39;t see other ways of

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.640
Caption: explaining consciousness

00:39:46.139 --> 00:39:49.199
Caption: but again to me when I look at the

00:39:47.639 --> 00:39:50.578
Caption: evolution of the species I think where

00:39:49.199 --> 00:39:52.679
Caption: does Consciousness come in it wasn&#39;t

00:39:50.579 --> 00:39:54.660
Caption: some time that the Universe jumped into

00:39:52.679 --> 00:39:56.280
Caption: our head and made us conscious it&#39;s more

00:39:54.659 --> 00:39:59.039
Caption: about the physical architecture and

00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.959
Caption: function of the brain

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.000
Caption: so the reason I put here a computational

00:40:00.959 --> 00:40:05.040
Caption: theory of Consciousness basically it&#39;s

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.500
Caption: got to do with self-awareness

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.599
Caption: so you act behind consistently with

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:12.839
Caption: regards to your States like seeing red

00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:16.200
Caption: or seeing or pain I think you can get

00:40:12.839 --> 00:40:18.239
Caption: most of it out of that but maybe not all

00:40:16.199 --> 00:40:20.699
Caption: the last thing here to look at is how do

00:40:18.239 --> 00:40:22.919
Caption: we make robots conscious that&#39;s the

00:40:20.699 --> 00:40:25.618
Caption: whole idea we want to make AI systems we

00:40:22.919 --> 00:40:27.540
Caption: can make computational AI systems but

00:40:25.618 --> 00:40:30.179
Caption: how can we make a robot that actually

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:32.939
Caption: has Consciousness now these are robots

00:40:30.179 --> 00:40:35.219
Caption: with cameras like eyes they can see and

00:40:32.939 --> 00:40:39.379
Caption: behave consistently but do they actually

00:40:35.219 --> 00:40:39.379
Caption: feel like they&#39;re looking as we do

00:40:39.899 --> 00:40:44.399
Caption: um so here&#39;s our robot we can make that

00:40:42.479 --> 00:40:46.260
Caption: robot work well when it turns its

00:40:44.399 --> 00:40:48.479
Caption: cameras on it can avoid the cars and

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:50.880
Caption: this sort of stuff but will the robot

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:52.079
Caption: say that it actually can feel that it&#39;s

00:40:50.879 --> 00:40:55.199
Caption: seeing things

00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:57.239
Caption: how can we make that actually happen

00:40:55.199 --> 00:40:59.520
Caption: and again I think basically we use this

00:40:57.239 --> 00:41:01.679
Caption: computational Theory we design our

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:04.020
Caption: robots not just to behave consistently

00:41:01.679 --> 00:41:06.780
Caption: with regards to the inputs and so forth

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:09.300
Caption: but to be a self-aware of the fact that

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:12.000
Caption: they are seeing they can see red and

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:13.859
Caption: they can feel pain and then our Behavior

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.379
Caption: becomes consistent with us actually

00:41:13.858 --> 00:41:18.719
Caption: feeling like we&#39;re seeing so I say yes I

00:41:16.379 --> 00:41:19.739
Caption: can see I can see things if I can feel

00:41:18.719 --> 00:41:21.358
Caption: it

00:41:19.739 --> 00:41:22.800
Caption: so basically again taking the

00:41:21.358 --> 00:41:25.259
Caption: computational approach but I won&#39;t go

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.239
Caption: into that haven&#39;t got time

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:29.939
Caption: that&#39;s about um all the I&#39;ll leave a

00:41:27.239 --> 00:41:31.139
Caption: second or two for um I&#39;ll just jump

00:41:29.939 --> 00:41:32.399
Caption: through this because I haven&#39;t got time

00:41:31.139 --> 00:41:34.679
Caption: to do that

00:41:32.399 --> 00:41:35.819
Caption: questions just to summarize I didn&#39;t

00:41:34.679 --> 00:41:37.618
Caption: want to do this

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:40.140
Caption: um

00:41:37.618 --> 00:41:42.000
Caption: sorry to summarize what we&#39;ve seen and

00:41:40.139 --> 00:41:43.979
Caption: maybe you agree or don&#39;t agree I&#39;ve

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.020
Caption: explained what a computational system is

00:41:43.979 --> 00:41:48.479
Caption: a system that allows three levels of

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:50.760
Caption: description had symbols that represent

00:41:48.479 --> 00:41:52.739
Caption: things and the maintained semantics

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:55.079
Caption: under transformations

00:41:52.739 --> 00:41:57.839
Caption: I&#39;ve talked about Von neume computers

00:41:55.079 --> 00:42:00.000
Caption: our discrete computational systems and

00:41:57.839 --> 00:42:01.680
Caption: the brain and connection of systems are

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.979
Caption: more like continuous computational

00:42:01.679 --> 00:42:06.179
Caption: systems

00:42:03.979 --> 00:42:08.159
Caption: I&#39;ve talked that being a computational

00:42:06.179 --> 00:42:11.118
Caption: system allows us to operationalize

00:42:08.159 --> 00:42:13.919
Caption: explain things like awareness

00:42:11.118 --> 00:42:16.199
Caption: self-awareness and possibly qualia and

00:42:13.919 --> 00:42:17.520
Caption: Consciousness as this consistent level

00:42:16.199 --> 00:42:19.020
Caption: of behavior

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:21.300
Caption: but importantly if any of you are

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:23.399
Caption: working in robotics or AI the real

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:25.679
Caption: question is how can we make robots truly

00:42:23.399 --> 00:42:28.319
Caption: human-like will need to make them

00:42:25.679 --> 00:42:30.540
Caption: computational systems but also aware

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:33.020
Caption: self-aware and have feelings and

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:33.020
Caption: consciousness

00:42:33.179 --> 00:42:36.838
Caption: so we can already already make lots of

00:42:35.159 --> 00:42:37.979
Caption: robots that are very smart and can do

00:42:36.839 --> 00:42:40.260
Caption: things

00:42:37.979 --> 00:42:41.939
Caption: but can we make robots that actually

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.099
Caption: feel pain

00:42:41.939 --> 00:42:45.780
Caption: maybe that&#39;s useful in an evolutionary

00:42:44.099 --> 00:42:47.520
Caption: approach or a programming approach so

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:50.040
Caption: it&#39;s aware of the fact that it&#39;s got a

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.560
Caption: knife in its leg or something like this

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:54.839
Caption: can we make robots that can actually see

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:58.439
Caption: and be aware of seeing not just behave

00:42:54.839 --> 00:43:00.180
Caption: consistently with what it means to see

00:42:58.439 --> 00:43:02.520
Caption: and I had to be trouble finding an image

00:43:00.179 --> 00:43:04.318
Caption: but can we make robots that are happy

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:06.239
Caption: and joyful

00:43:04.319 --> 00:43:08.579
Caption: okay not many robot photos show them

00:43:06.239 --> 00:43:12.179
Caption: being happy we haven&#39;t tried to make

00:43:08.579 --> 00:43:13.920
Caption: them feel like they&#39;re happy

00:43:12.179 --> 00:43:16.618
Caption: so all right that&#39;s about all there so I

00:43:13.919 --> 00:43:19.559
Caption: have any questions or quick questions a

00:43:16.618 --> 00:43:21.479
Caption: lot of stuff but uh hopefully it

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:25.459
Caption: provided some explanation of what it

00:43:21.479 --> 00:43:25.459
Caption: means to see and to be computational yep

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.959
Caption: okay first question

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:31.618
Caption: so just on your first point

00:43:30.959 --> 00:43:35.338
Caption: um

00:43:31.618 --> 00:43:37.799
Caption: you said that you there might be an

00:43:35.339 --> 00:43:40.859
Caption: advantage for having a AI system

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:43.679
Caption: actually fill Consciousness right but is

00:43:40.858 --> 00:43:46.139
Caption: there really any advantage to doing that

00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:47.818
Caption: like a very good question very good

00:43:46.139 --> 00:43:49.739
Caption: question is there any advantage to

00:43:47.819 --> 00:43:51.719
Caption: actually feeling something rather than

00:43:49.739 --> 00:43:53.339
Caption: just behaving consistently you know we

00:43:51.719 --> 00:43:55.199
Caption: could if someone puts a knife in our leg

00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:57.420
Caption: we could behave consistently and pull it

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:59.520
Caption: out and not even be aware of it in fact

00:43:57.419 --> 00:44:01.078
Caption: when you&#39;re sleepwalking people

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.159
Caption: sleepwalk and they do eating and

00:44:01.079 --> 00:44:03.359
Caption: everything when they&#39;re asleep so

00:44:02.159 --> 00:44:05.760
Caption: they&#39;re not conscious but they&#39;re doing

00:44:03.358 --> 00:44:07.439
Caption: all they&#39;re behaving consistently

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.239
Caption: so it&#39;s a really good question and I

00:44:07.439 --> 00:44:11.459
Caption: believe there must be some evolutionary

00:44:09.239 --> 00:44:13.800
Caption: advantage to know you&#39;re in in pain

00:44:11.459 --> 00:44:15.899
Caption: maybe even to learn from that experience

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.880
Caption: so it&#39;s not just behaving consistently

00:44:15.899 --> 00:44:19.919
Caption: you&#39;re aware of the fact yes that was

00:44:17.879 --> 00:44:22.979
Caption: pain maybe I can change my behavior and

00:44:19.919 --> 00:44:24.598
Caption: so forth so evolutionary I think why are

00:44:22.979 --> 00:44:27.419
Caption: they here and probably because it makes

00:44:24.599 --> 00:44:31.380
Caption: us a fitter species to survive

00:44:27.419 --> 00:44:32.939
Caption: I think the only difference you&#39;d see is

00:44:31.379 --> 00:44:36.779
Caption: that

00:44:32.939 --> 00:44:39.419
Caption: um the AIA system would write a

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.560
Caption: Wikipedia page about Columbia I think

00:44:39.419 --> 00:44:41.818
Caption: that&#39;s the only difference that would

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.619
Caption: see provided that I didn&#39;t have that

00:44:41.819 --> 00:44:45.900
Caption: could be true but but we have a lot of

00:44:43.618 --> 00:44:47.399
Caption: feelings you know we feel what it&#39;s like

00:44:45.899 --> 00:44:51.118
Caption: to see we feel like it&#39;s what it&#39;s like

00:44:47.399 --> 00:44:52.500
Caption: to be read we feel pain why not if we

00:44:51.118 --> 00:44:54.419
Caption: didn&#39;t feel pain we could just do the

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.919
Caption: stuff without feeling it would that be

00:44:54.419 --> 00:44:57.838
Caption: okay I think there&#39;s something to that

00:44:55.919 --> 00:44:59.699
Caption: feeling pain you really learn something

00:44:57.839 --> 00:45:01.859
Caption: from it as I say it&#39;s more like it&#39;s a

00:44:59.699 --> 00:45:03.358
Caption: higher level abstraction doesn&#39;t matter

00:45:01.858 --> 00:45:05.519
Caption: what sort of pain it is we&#39;re just

00:45:03.358 --> 00:45:07.679
Caption: learning to respond to pain but it&#39;s an

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.179
Caption: open question

00:45:07.679 --> 00:45:12.598
Caption: just going to add that we are moving

00:45:09.179 --> 00:45:13.979
Caption: into lunch so we have plenty of time for

00:45:12.599 --> 00:45:16.140
Caption: questions I think I&#39;m going to trespass

00:45:13.979 --> 00:45:18.239
Caption: on Dr Ashley&#39;s time here and ask you to

00:45:16.139 --> 00:45:19.679
Caption: stay but if you do did want to make a

00:45:18.239 --> 00:45:21.300
Caption: move and grab your lunch now you&#39;d be

00:45:19.679 --> 00:45:24.618
Caption: very welcome to do so

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:24.619
Caption: um I see we have a question here

00:45:25.439 --> 00:45:30.000
Caption: just quickly top down versus bottom up

00:45:28.919 --> 00:45:32.159
Caption: AI

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.879
Caption: and host the development going along

00:45:32.159 --> 00:45:37.618
Caption: that as well as with so top down is

00:45:35.879 --> 00:45:40.139
Caption: probably that symbolic approach yes

00:45:37.618 --> 00:45:42.539
Caption: right and I think It suffers from its

00:45:40.139 --> 00:45:44.519
Caption: fragile you can write some rules but

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:46.619
Caption: they don&#39;t actually work in every case

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.599
Caption: so it breaks and doesn&#39;t work properly

00:45:46.618 --> 00:45:51.118
Caption: that&#39;s what we found with expert systems

00:45:48.599 --> 00:45:53.160
Caption: whereas bottom up when things emerge

00:45:51.118 --> 00:45:54.779
Caption: they tend to be more stable and they can

00:45:53.159 --> 00:45:56.939
Caption: handle things which aren&#39;t exactly what

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.800
Caption: you predicted so bottom up is definitely

00:45:56.939 --> 00:46:00.598
Caption: the way to go and we see all the stuff

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.699
Caption: we&#39;re seeing from eBay Western and the

00:46:00.599 --> 00:46:05.160
Caption: phones have neural networks now it&#39;s

00:46:02.699 --> 00:46:08.459
Caption: emergent and learning these things what

00:46:05.159 --> 00:46:11.939
Caption: about teaching an artificial intelligent

00:46:08.459 --> 00:46:14.159
Caption: being ethics and morals

00:46:11.939 --> 00:46:16.739
Caption: this where it comes back to I think a

00:46:14.159 --> 00:46:18.059
Caption: bit more about language and words and

00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:19.979
Caption: what do they mean and how what

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:22.680
Caption: consequences they have you know language

00:46:19.979 --> 00:46:24.239
Caption: is just Behavior so I can say I&#39;m moral

00:46:22.679 --> 00:46:26.040
Caption: and I can say it 100 times doesn&#39;t mean

00:46:24.239 --> 00:46:28.079
Caption: I&#39;m going to behave morally right it

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:30.739
Caption: doesn&#39;t control our Behavior language is

00:46:28.079 --> 00:46:32.640
Caption: just a behavior so but the

00:46:30.739 --> 00:46:34.500
Caption: correlationship between that language

00:46:32.639 --> 00:46:36.959
Caption: and the behavior and the consistency

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.579
Caption: between the two sure it but it doesn&#39;t

00:46:36.959 --> 00:46:39.899
Caption: have to exist there are many criminals

00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:41.819
Caption: who think of themselves as good people

00:46:39.899 --> 00:46:44.699
Caption: and honest and they go and commit crimes

00:46:41.819 --> 00:46:46.979
Caption: so it doesn&#39;t we&#39;re not we&#39;re not driven

00:46:44.699 --> 00:46:48.899
Caption: by our logic we&#39;re driven by the

00:46:46.979 --> 00:46:50.280
Caption: behavior we learn and experience and I

00:46:48.899 --> 00:46:53.459
Caption: missed a section there on describing

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:55.439
Caption: complex Behavior just briefly I believe

00:46:53.459 --> 00:46:57.838
Caption: we actually learn by just seeing

00:46:55.439 --> 00:47:00.919
Caption: patterns and replaying those patterns

00:46:57.839 --> 00:47:03.960
Caption: using very complex hierarchical

00:47:00.919 --> 00:47:05.760
Caption: Association engine as I call it so we&#39;re

00:47:03.959 --> 00:47:07.800
Caption: just behaving what we&#39;ve seen and we

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:09.419
Caption: replay those behaviors over and over and

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.579
Caption: we look you know doing anything it&#39;s

00:47:09.419 --> 00:47:14.639
Caption: basically just replaying behaviors in

00:47:11.579 --> 00:47:16.859
Caption: certain contexts so language is that you

00:47:14.639 --> 00:47:19.019
Caption: know I learned to say things and I

00:47:16.858 --> 00:47:22.318
Caption: last question when you&#39;re a diverse

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:23.880
Caption: individuals out of my scope there out of

00:47:22.319 --> 00:47:25.560
Caption: my scope we all got different brains

00:47:23.879 --> 00:47:27.539
Caption: with different you know functions and in

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:29.640
Caption: different areas and different abilities

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:32.160
Caption: to abstract and different learning rates

00:47:29.639 --> 00:47:36.260
Caption: so there&#39;s a wide variation and I would

00:47:32.159 --> 00:47:36.260
Caption: call them all computational systems so

00:47:36.959 --> 00:47:42.118
Caption: I&#39;m sorry hey

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:43.380
Caption: um really good talk thank you I I agree

00:47:42.118 --> 00:47:45.299
Caption: with you I think there&#39;s probably a lot

00:47:43.379 --> 00:47:47.519
Caption: of scientific benefit to be gained by

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:49.020
Caption: potentially giving Consciousness and

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:51.719
Caption: certain other sort of like Memphis

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:54.719
Caption: School abilities for robots to be able

00:47:51.719 --> 00:47:56.939
Caption: to to do but in the scientific Community

00:47:54.719 --> 00:47:59.040
Caption: we&#39;re typically bounded by sets of rules

00:47:56.939 --> 00:48:01.979
Caption: of what we not just what we can do but

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.839
Caption: what we should do so how do you feel you

00:48:01.979 --> 00:48:06.358
Caption: know what the ethical Implement

00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:08.640
Caption: implications might be of giving the

00:48:06.358 --> 00:48:11.159
Caption: robot the ability to feel pain yeah it&#39;s

00:48:08.639 --> 00:48:13.078
Caption: a good question it&#39;s a good question

00:48:11.159 --> 00:48:15.239
Caption: um if you think of this as just machines

00:48:13.079 --> 00:48:17.220
Caption: experiencing pain

00:48:15.239 --> 00:48:18.959
Caption: we&#39;re just machines experiencing pain

00:48:17.219 --> 00:48:21.959
Caption: robots are just machines experiencing

00:48:18.959 --> 00:48:23.338
Caption: pain we know we&#39;ve made a guess that

00:48:21.959 --> 00:48:26.280
Caption: it&#39;s biologically or evolutionary

00:48:23.339 --> 00:48:28.500
Caption: advantage to feel pain if we give down

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:31.020
Caption: ability then we put pain on them it&#39;s

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:33.500
Caption: the same as putting pain on a person so

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:35.699
Caption: you have to take a consideration of that

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.979
Caption: because it&#39;s really innate that feeling

00:48:35.699 --> 00:48:40.260
Caption: of pain is so deep and so strong in your

00:48:37.979 --> 00:48:43.679
Caption: system that is sort of a part of you so

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:45.000
Caption: if you make pain or hurt a robot then

00:48:43.679 --> 00:48:48.020
Caption: the same sort of thing so you&#39;d be

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.020
Caption: responsible for it I guess

00:48:48.118 --> 00:48:53.279
Caption: lots of good questions thank you I was

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:56.400
Caption: wondering uh where your feedback would

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:59.280
Caption: be on the um call out the the Google AI

00:48:56.399 --> 00:49:01.318
Caption: may or may not be Sentinel yeah sure

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.339
Caption: what are your thoughts on that so I

00:49:01.319 --> 00:49:04.079
Caption: don&#39;t know anything about the project

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:06.000
Caption: particularly that one they were talking

00:49:04.079 --> 00:49:08.099
Caption: about but it&#39;s mainly what they&#39;re doing

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.020
Caption: they&#39;re training these uh systems on

00:49:08.099 --> 00:49:12.720
Caption: large amounts of text

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:14.760
Caption: to respond with text so they get they

00:49:12.719 --> 00:49:16.139
Caption: learn lots of context which is what I

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:18.060
Caption: was going to explain in the extra slides

00:49:16.139 --> 00:49:20.519
Caption: there your cortex is basically a

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:21.660
Caption: hierarchical context engine so it learns

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:24.239
Caption: if you&#39;re in this context in this

00:49:21.659 --> 00:49:26.760
Caption: context in this state you say this

00:49:24.239 --> 00:49:28.679
Caption: and this is what they did they put lots

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:30.959
Caption: of training on if you see this sentence

00:49:28.679 --> 00:49:32.879
Caption: you say this sentence and you have huge

00:49:30.959 --> 00:49:34.199
Caption: millions and millions of training but

00:49:32.879 --> 00:49:36.539
Caption: the problem there again is they&#39;re

00:49:34.199 --> 00:49:39.300
Caption: working at that symbolic level

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:41.520
Caption: all right the the saving Graces they

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:43.560
Caption: don&#39;t have if then rules there&#39;s

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:45.479
Caption: statistics between the symbols if you

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:47.160
Caption: see this symbol then statistically this

00:49:45.479 --> 00:49:48.719
Caption: one&#39;s more likely than this one so

00:49:47.159 --> 00:49:51.659
Caption: they&#39;re sort of halfway between the

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:53.699
Caption: continuous and the discrete they&#39;re sort

00:49:51.659 --> 00:49:57.838
Caption: of halfway there the symbols are fixed

00:49:53.699 --> 00:50:00.000
Caption: but they&#39;re um rules are sort of

00:49:57.839 --> 00:50:04.319
Caption: continuous and change with learning

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.300
Caption: so whether it&#39;s conscious or not

00:50:04.319 --> 00:50:07.920
Caption: again I guess we&#39;d come back to

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.719
Caption: Consciousness again is different than

00:50:07.919 --> 00:50:11.818
Caption: this being computational I think it

00:50:09.719 --> 00:50:14.520
Caption: would be a computational system it

00:50:11.819 --> 00:50:16.319
Caption: understands when you say it&#39;s raining oh

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.359
Caption: yes I&#39;ll take my umbrella so it&#39;s

00:50:16.319 --> 00:50:21.420
Caption: behaving consistently at a symbolic

00:50:18.358 --> 00:50:23.939
Caption: level so it understands the semantics of

00:50:21.419 --> 00:50:25.739
Caption: raining an umbrella

00:50:23.939 --> 00:50:27.780
Caption: but the issue there and this is just

00:50:25.739 --> 00:50:30.419
Caption: reminded we had an extra slide is that

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:32.099
Caption: AI system is not grounded and what I

00:50:30.419 --> 00:50:34.739
Caption: mean by grounded is we actually

00:50:32.099 --> 00:50:37.680
Caption: experience rain and see rain it&#39;s just

00:50:34.739 --> 00:50:39.780
Caption: getting text in and text out so it

00:50:37.679 --> 00:50:41.818
Caption: really doesn&#39;t know what rain is it&#39;s

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:43.739
Caption: just saying what it needs to say to

00:50:41.819 --> 00:50:46.800
Caption: respond correctly to that rain

00:50:43.739 --> 00:50:49.439
Caption: so I think it&#39;s understands rain in its

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:51.839
Caption: concept of rain defined by its semantics

00:50:49.439 --> 00:50:53.459
Caption: and symbols but it has it&#39;s not grounded

00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:55.980
Caption: like a real robot would be and can

00:50:53.459 --> 00:50:58.318
Caption: experience rain so I think they&#39;re

00:50:55.979 --> 00:51:01.079
Caption: computational but I wouldn&#39;t go so far

00:50:58.319 --> 00:51:03.300
Caption: as to say they&#39;re aware or self-aware or

00:51:01.079 --> 00:51:04.859
Caption: conscious it&#39;s just this compute the

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:07.140
Caption: semantics are there because we&#39;ve

00:51:04.858 --> 00:51:08.459
Caption: learned so much but I wouldn&#39;t call it

00:51:07.139 --> 00:51:09.899
Caption: sentient

00:51:08.459 --> 00:51:11.338
Caption: are you comfortable for some more

00:51:09.899 --> 00:51:13.439
Caption: questions happy too excellent people

00:51:11.339 --> 00:51:14.760
Caption: have some questions

00:51:13.439 --> 00:51:17.399
Caption: um with the different levels of um

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:19.679
Caption: abstraction of um physical functional

00:51:17.399 --> 00:51:22.379
Caption: Etc do do you think the different levels

00:51:19.679 --> 00:51:24.659
Caption: have any irreducible emotion Properties

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:26.699
Caption: or they&#39;re just useful abstractions in

00:51:24.659 --> 00:51:28.919
Caption: each level

00:51:26.699 --> 00:51:30.179
Caption: I&#39;m not really sure I don&#39;t have an

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:31.439
Caption: answer to that

00:51:30.179 --> 00:51:34.739
Caption: um

00:51:31.439 --> 00:51:37.260
Caption: irreducible properties now we know the

00:51:34.739 --> 00:51:40.919
Caption: symbolic level needs to represent

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:42.419
Caption: uh it&#39;s it&#39;s just the abstraction is so

00:51:40.919 --> 00:51:44.639
Caption: important I think that&#39;s the most

00:51:42.419 --> 00:51:46.500
Caption: important aspect of this and I sort of

00:51:44.639 --> 00:51:48.479
Caption: alluded to it you know I had a question

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:50.459
Caption: I use when I&#39;m trying to explain

00:51:48.479 --> 00:51:53.939
Caption: abstraction to people how useful it is

00:51:50.459 --> 00:51:55.439
Caption: if I told you there are 10 billion atoms

00:51:53.939 --> 00:51:57.058
Caption: here and this is how they&#39;re all

00:51:55.439 --> 00:52:00.000
Caption: configured I gave you the exact location

00:51:57.059 --> 00:52:01.380
Caption: and I said that&#39;s the car I want go and

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.819
Caption: buy it

00:52:01.379 --> 00:52:04.618
Caption: you wouldn&#39;t even be able to tell what

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:07.079
Caption: color the car is let alone what model

00:52:04.618 --> 00:52:09.419
Caption: and what engine so although you have all

00:52:07.079 --> 00:52:12.000
Caption: the detail of the physical system every

00:52:09.419 --> 00:52:13.979
Caption: little specific detail you&#39;re losing

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.020
Caption: what you get at the higher level so

00:52:13.979 --> 00:52:18.540
Caption: ignoring the detail can actually be more

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:20.640
Caption: useful than the lower level so that&#39;s

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:22.800
Caption: what we get from the abstractions

00:52:20.639 --> 00:52:25.139
Caption: having that symbolic level says we can

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:27.300
Caption: ignore the functional States and writing

00:52:25.139 --> 00:52:29.818
Caption: the symbols so we get command a

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:31.859
Caption: consistent semantics is the benefit but

00:52:29.819 --> 00:52:33.479
Caption: I don&#39;t know of any irreducible

00:52:31.858 --> 00:52:35.699
Caption: properties of these different levels

00:52:33.479 --> 00:52:37.439
Caption: particularly so it&#39;s a limitation of

00:52:35.699 --> 00:52:40.558
Caption: like the human mind or the processing as

00:52:37.439 --> 00:52:42.780
Caption: opposed to a reality itself it&#39;s

00:52:40.559 --> 00:52:45.479
Caption: yeah it&#39;s a human the human brain is

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:48.599
Caption: learning symbols and learning semantics

00:52:45.479 --> 00:52:50.280
Caption: and it&#39;s wired at a neural level so that

00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:52.380
Caption: eventually learns something which is

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.819
Caption: consistent and allows us to survive in

00:52:52.379 --> 00:52:55.259
Caption: the world you know you could be

00:52:53.819 --> 00:52:56.880
Caption: programmed wrong so you then come out

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:58.439
Caption: with wrong semantics and you&#39;re bumping

00:52:56.879 --> 00:53:00.000
Caption: into everything and you can&#39;t talk and

00:52:58.439 --> 00:53:02.219
Caption: you get your wife and try to put it on

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.618
Caption: your head that wouldn&#39;t work but luckily

00:53:02.219 --> 00:53:06.719
Caption: our learning tends to end us up with a

00:53:04.618 --> 00:53:08.519
Caption: semantic system that is useful that&#39;s

00:53:06.719 --> 00:53:10.618
Caption: what evolution has given us and that&#39;s

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:13.199
Caption: what AI is trying to do build systems

00:53:10.618 --> 00:53:16.199
Caption: that learn from experiences and become

00:53:13.199 --> 00:53:16.199
Caption: useful

00:53:17.699 --> 00:53:20.639
Caption: thank you very much for your attention

00:53:19.379 --> 00:53:22.139
Caption: thank you happy to answer any other

00:53:20.639 --> 00:53:25.519
Caption: questions if you want but thank you

00:53:22.139 --> 00:53:25.519
Caption: Hannah great talk thank you so much
