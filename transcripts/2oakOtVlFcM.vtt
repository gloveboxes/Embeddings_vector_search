Caption: which I&#39;m a little bit nervous about but

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:04.559
Caption: I do feel that

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:06.180
Caption: um sharing and normalizing and

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:09.619
Caption: acknowledging these feelings go a long

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.619
Caption: way to actually overcoming them

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.319
Caption: it might be one of the try one of the

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.319
Caption: different

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:23.779

Caption: putting a hand up but that&#39;s all right

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.500
Caption: because everybody else put their hand up

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.500
Caption: so that&#39;s cool

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.819

00:03:26.458 --> 00:03:29.119
Caption: of the sponsors

00:03:31.018 --> 00:03:35.819
Caption: all right so I&#39;m going to start off with

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.458
Caption: one of my personal stories when I

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.738
Caption: started joining the tech industry I felt

00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:42.298
Caption: quite overwhelmed

00:03:40.738 --> 00:03:43.798
Caption: um when I just like my first day there

00:03:42.298 --> 00:03:45.598
Caption: was a lot of new things to learn there

00:03:43.798 --> 00:03:47.940
Caption: was new languages to learn a new code

00:03:45.598 --> 00:03:50.759
Caption: base to navigate all these new tools

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.860
Caption: that I had to learn about and it was

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:55.080
Caption: quite frankly a little bit

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.518
Caption: um much and especially also looking at

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.919
Caption: my colleagues who all seem to navigate

00:03:56.518 --> 00:04:00.899
Caption: this really really well more often than

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.598
Caption: not I kind of felt like do I even belong

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:05.399
Caption: in this industry maybe I shouldn&#39;t have

00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:08.220
Caption: done this

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:10.319
Caption: so what I felt and I&#39;m still currently

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.139
Caption: regularly experiencing is the textbook

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.360
Caption: definition of imposter syndrome

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.979
Caption: and imposter syndrome can be defined as

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.320
Caption: feelings of self-doubt and personal

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.779
Caption: incompetence that persists despite your

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.779
Caption: education experience or accomplishments

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.940
Caption: um

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.160
Caption: so you might wonder what does it feel

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.800
Caption: like to have imposter feelings well if

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.019
Caption: you kind of feel like you are big Birds

00:04:34.799 --> 00:04:38.940
Caption: trying to fit in with the Darth Vader

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:40.739
Caption: Darth Vader grew on the Death Star

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.940
Caption: that&#39;s when you can probably tell that

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:43.940
Caption: you have impossible feelings

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:48.299
Caption: um but Jokes Aside there are some common

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.199
Caption: imposter thoughts that are likely to

00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:50.519
Caption: occur

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.839
Caption: um so let&#39;s have a look and see what

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:54.059
Caption: goes on in the mind of people with

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:56.639
Caption: imposter feelings

00:04:54.059 --> 00:05:00.259
Caption: so you might feel like you are a fake

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.259
Caption: and you&#39;re going to be found out

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.720
Caption: sorry about that

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.679
Caption: you might feel that you actually don&#39;t

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.459
Caption: deserve your success and you may have

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:13.459
Caption: just gotten lucky

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:18.000
Caption: you may feel like you&#39;re not released

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:21.139
Caption: that special at all and you feel like if

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.179
Caption: you can do it everybody else can do it

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.220
Caption: or you may not be very good with praise

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:28.679
Caption: and just kind of like wave it off as

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.419
Caption: like oh I had a lot of help

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:33.320
Caption: or maybe you just think that they were

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.320
Caption: just being nice to you

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:37.199
Caption: but regardless what you&#39;re feeling it

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.300
Caption: turns out to be

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.600
Caption: um very very common within the tech

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:45.000
Caption: industry it&#39;s actually 58 of people who

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.800
Caption: experience imposter feelings currently

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.019
Caption: in their career and this includes people

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:50.279
Caption: from companies like Amazon Google and

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:52.799
Caption: Facebook

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:55.079
Caption: so this is a study that has been done by

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:57.599
Caption: blinds they have done a very very

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:59.939
Caption: scientific study where they send people

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.119
Caption: a question in their app and asked do you

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.519
Caption: have impulsive feelings yes or no I mean

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:07.500
Caption: it&#39;s very simple but um yeah as you can

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:09.239
Caption: see they they are interviewed a lot of

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.559
Caption: people in in a lot of different

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:13.138
Caption: companies that are quite familiar to

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:15.779
Caption: most of you I reckon and this is a graph

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.419
Caption: of these companies that have the highest

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:22.339
Caption: rates of imposter feelings so

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.339
Caption: rest assured you are not alone

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.160
Caption: but why is it such a common thing in

00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:27.899
Caption: Tech why do so many people in our

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.639
Caption: industry feel like they&#39;re undeserving

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:31.739
Caption: of their success despite their obvious

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.839
Caption: Merit

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:35.638
Caption: well I can think of one thing

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:37.859
Caption: I don&#39;t know if anyone here has ever

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:40.139
Caption: tried to explain to their mom what it is

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:42.179
Caption: that they&#39;re doing without them zoning

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:44.520
Caption: out or kind of looking at you like

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:46.319
Caption: you&#39;re speaking in another language

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:48.000
Caption: but it&#39;s not just the people from

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:49.799
Caption: outside the industry it kind of like

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.440
Caption: happens within the industry as well I&#39;m

00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:54.959
Caption: sure a lot of you have heard stories of

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.339
Caption: um projects that have been pushed where

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:58.380
Caption: you like gave an estimate that it would

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:00.479
Caption: take four weeks six weeks and they would

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.580
Caption: push you to do it in four weeks

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:04.380
Caption: but then there&#39;s also

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:06.959
Caption: um

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.459
Caption: expectations that come from within so

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:10.259
Caption: for instance if you&#39;re a new starter in

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:11.819
Caption: the industry you may not really know

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.979
Caption: what you need to do in order to perform

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:15.720
Caption: in your industry

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:17.819
Caption: um or if you are more experienced

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.500
Caption: something like a promotion or new

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.720
Caption: responsibilities can trigger imposter

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.419
Caption: feelings as well

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.399
Caption: then there is also the fast pace that&#39;s

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:29.580
Caption: happening in the tech industry things

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:32.160
Caption: change a lot there&#39;s new languages all

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:33.720
Caption: the time there&#39;s new Concepts that you

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.199
Caption: need to learn all the time you have to

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.179
Caption: keep up otherwise you will be outdated

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:41.098
Caption: and the same kind of works for companies

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:42.598
Caption: in general you always have to try and do

00:07:41.098 --> 00:07:45.899
Caption: the new thing to make your customers

00:07:42.598 --> 00:07:47.160
Caption: happy otherwise they will go elsewhere

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:49.259
Caption: um and it also kind of happens to

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.880
Caption: yourself you just want to keep up you

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:52.500
Caption: want to do a good job as a new starter

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.179
Caption: you might even want to like rush into

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.699
Caption: things and make sure that you get up to

00:07:54.179 --> 00:08:01.399
Caption: speed as soon as possible and in the

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:01.399
Caption: process you may end up being burnt out

00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:07.799
Caption: um but we shouldn&#39;t talk about it right

00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:09.478
Caption: because it&#39;s kind of embarrassing to

00:08:07.799 --> 00:08:12.739
Caption: have these feelings and I&#39;m probably the

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:12.739
Caption: only person who has it

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:21.679
Caption: and then there is also the part of like

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:21.679
Caption: some of us

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:27.799
Caption: this has literally happened to me today

00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:27.799
Caption: I haven&#39;t had a single line it was great

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.580
Caption: um

00:08:31.019 --> 00:08:34.200
Caption: yeah so one of the other things that can

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.000
Caption: cause imposter feelings as well is

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.380
Caption: especially from people from

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.580
Caption: underrepresented groups is that they

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.619
Caption: don&#39;t really have these people that they

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.718
Caption: can look up to they miss

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:45.359
Caption: um people with empathetic leadership

00:08:42.718 --> 00:08:47.099
Caption: skills or um like just generally people

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:49.640
Caption: who look like them who&#39;ve had success in

00:08:47.099 --> 00:08:49.639
Caption: their workplace

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:54.838
Caption: and if things weren&#39;t already bad enough

00:08:52.018 --> 00:08:57.359
Caption: in the tech industry of course we also

00:08:54.838 --> 00:09:00.179
Caption: have been hit by this thing called covet

00:08:57.359 --> 00:09:02.039
Caption: and covet has kind of made us work in in

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:03.958
Caption: different ways now we all have kind of a

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:05.880
Caption: new role and we have to get ready like

00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:08.099
Caption: have to be ready to work from home and

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.739
Caption: some of you may have even been parenting

00:09:08.099 --> 00:09:12.000
Caption: as well well I&#39;m teaching while working

00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:14.099
Caption: from home

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.299
Caption: so yeah lots have happened and lots of

00:09:14.099 --> 00:09:17.940
Caption: things that can actually trigger your

00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:20.820
Caption: imposter feelings

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.440
Caption: but despite what you&#39;re feeling is can

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.320
Caption: be quite nerve-wracking it&#39;s actually

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.359
Caption: pretty normal and having a little bit of

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.100
Caption: self-doubt is actually healthy because

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:31.979
Caption: it will push you to do better things to

00:09:29.099 --> 00:09:35.599
Caption: become better to learn new things so you

00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:35.599
Caption: shouldn&#39;t feel bad about it

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:40.500
Caption: the goal here is to not feel like an

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.359
Caption: imposter ever again

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.398
Caption: but to have the tools to talk yourself

00:09:42.359 --> 00:09:46.700
Caption: down faster when you have an imposter

00:09:44.398 --> 00:09:46.700
Caption: moment

00:09:47.278 --> 00:09:51.000
Caption: so let&#39;s go back through those

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:52.679
Caption: expectations I&#39;m sure many of you have

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.278
Caption: seen this one

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:59.580
Caption: um when I got promoted about six months

00:09:56.278 --> 00:10:02.099
Caption: ago I felt like I didn&#39;t deserve it at

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.720
Caption: all I wasn&#39;t ready I still felt like I

00:10:02.099 --> 00:10:05.458
Caption: had so much to learn and there was so

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:07.919
Caption: many other associates who were way more

00:10:05.458 --> 00:10:10.979
Caption: prepared for this than me

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:13.260
Caption: um so yeah my expectations of where I

00:10:10.979 --> 00:10:14.940
Caption: needed to be were where I thought I had

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.979
Caption: to be versus where I actually had to be

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.898
Caption: way out of whack because if I look at it

00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:20.760
Caption: rationally I had met all those

00:10:18.898 --> 00:10:23.338
Caption: requirements

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:28.160
Caption: um yeah so

00:10:23.338 --> 00:10:28.159
Caption: well sorry kind of blanking here

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.518
Caption: yeah so I focus so hard on the things

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:41.940
Caption: that I didn&#39;t know that I kind of forget

00:10:38.518 --> 00:10:44.219
Caption: how far I actually have come so far if

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.838
Caption: you look at me a year and a half ago the

00:10:44.219 --> 00:10:48.000
Caption: only thing I was probably able to do was

00:10:45.838 --> 00:10:51.838
Caption: write a line of python that said hello

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.880
Caption: world in a console and now I am working

00:10:51.838 --> 00:10:56.278
Caption: as a software engineer full-time at a

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.599
Caption: company I am mentoring and guiding

00:10:56.278 --> 00:10:59.518
Caption: people who are new to the industry or

00:10:57.599 --> 00:11:01.500
Caption: new to the job and I am standing here

00:10:59.518 --> 00:11:05.000
Caption: presenting for all of you so that should

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.000
Caption: probably count for something I guess

00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:09.359
Caption: foreign

00:11:11.119 --> 00:11:15.778
Caption: so yeah I appreciate the progress that

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.000
Caption: you have made so far but if you&#39;re

00:11:15.778 --> 00:11:20.458
Caption: really struggling to do that there&#39;s

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.338
Caption: other ways that you can kind of like

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:26.039
Caption: uh focus on how far you&#39;ve come and it&#39;s

00:11:23.338 --> 00:11:27.719
Caption: mentoring others if you are able to

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:29.759
Caption: teach a New Concept to a person who&#39;s

00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:32.039
Caption: like just starting out that&#39;s a really

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.778
Caption: good way to sort of gauge like oh I&#39;ve

00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:35.398
Caption: actually managed to learn this myself

00:11:33.778 --> 00:11:39.200
Caption: quite well and I&#39;m able to actually

00:11:35.398 --> 00:11:39.200
Caption: teach this to other people

00:11:39.778 --> 00:11:44.458
Caption: but if you are really really set on

00:11:42.059 --> 00:11:47.338
Caption: looking forward please remember that

00:11:44.458 --> 00:11:48.299
Caption: your career is a marathon and not a

00:11:47.338 --> 00:11:51.239
Caption: Sprint

00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:53.760
Caption: if you take a nice steady Pace like a

00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:55.679
Caption: marathon runner you can learn all these

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.600
Caption: new skills and learn all these new

00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:59.820
Caption: knowledge while

00:11:57.599 --> 00:12:02.359
Caption: not really zooming past anything that&#39;s

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.359
Caption: important

00:12:03.119 --> 00:12:06.778
Caption: and part of that is also to do with

00:12:04.859 --> 00:12:09.898
Caption: setting appropriate goals

00:12:06.778 --> 00:12:11.760
Caption: you want to be able to focus on the core

00:12:09.898 --> 00:12:13.260
Caption: skills developing core skills and rather

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.419
Caption: than focusing on trying to learn

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.398
Caption: everything all at once which I&#39;m sure is

00:12:15.419 --> 00:12:20.958
Caption: a rabbit hole that many of us has fallen

00:12:17.398 --> 00:12:20.958
Caption: into me included

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:27.539
Caption: and also stop comparing yourself to

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:29.880
Caption: others this is one that&#39;s very easy to

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:31.739
Caption: fall into as well you tend to kind of

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.380
Caption: forget that other people may have had

00:12:31.739 --> 00:12:36.599
Caption: like a lot more experience than you

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.578
Caption: um so comparing yourself to someone else

00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:41.099
Caption: who went through a way different Journey

00:12:38.578 --> 00:12:43.919
Caption: or has been working in the industry for

00:12:41.099 --> 00:12:46.500
Caption: a few years now doesn&#39;t really help

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:49.559
Caption: so instead try and look at them like

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:52.138
Caption: Role Models or turn to them for help

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:53.958
Caption: so it can really be helpful to share

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:56.699
Caption: your imposter feelings with others

00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:58.138
Caption: because they will a lot of them will be

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.820
Caption: able to kind of like acknowledge that

00:12:58.138 --> 00:13:01.199
Caption: they&#39;re probably experiencing the same

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.720
Caption: thing from time to time or have

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.799
Caption: experiences in the past

00:13:03.719 --> 00:13:06.838
Caption: um and having these feelings of

00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:09.059
Caption: knowledge can work quite well I can tell

00:13:06.838 --> 00:13:12.599
Caption: you from experience

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:13.919
Caption: because um I share my feelings with my

00:13:12.599 --> 00:13:16.819
Caption: manager

00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:16.820
Caption: all the time

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.700
Caption: I can&#39;t I can&#39;t even count the number of

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.018
Caption: times that I&#39;ve been in a one-on-one

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.299
Caption: being like I feel like I&#39;m not

00:13:22.018 --> 00:13:25.739
Caption: progressing fast enough and I need to

00:13:24.299 --> 00:13:27.479
Caption: know more and I need to learn more and

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:29.219
Caption: blah and he&#39;s just always managed to

00:13:27.479 --> 00:13:31.260
Caption: make me feel better and that&#39;s because

00:13:29.219 --> 00:13:32.759
Caption: he has like all of this experience and

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.018
Caption: knowledge of like yeah he has

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.239
Caption: experienced the same kind of feelings

00:13:34.018 --> 00:13:38.039
Caption: and he has seen similar things by

00:13:36.239 --> 00:13:41.518
Caption: mentoring others as well so it&#39;s

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:44.338
Caption: incredibly helpful to have a mentor to

00:13:41.518 --> 00:13:46.799
Caption: help you out with this sort of stuff

00:13:44.338 --> 00:13:49.559
Caption: but you know might also be wondering

00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:51.239
Caption: Christy weren&#39;t you a psychologist

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:53.219
Caption: you should probably have some cool

00:13:51.239 --> 00:13:56.338
Caption: tricks up your sleeve right

00:13:53.219 --> 00:13:58.439
Caption: I do okay but I want to give a little

00:13:56.338 --> 00:14:00.778
Caption: bit of a disclaimer here

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.539
Caption: um because as a psychologist we are

00:14:00.778 --> 00:14:06.119
Caption: really good at um

00:14:03.539 --> 00:14:07.619
Caption: uh advising other people and helping

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:10.018
Caption: guiding other people but when it comes

00:14:07.619 --> 00:14:12.838
Caption: to ourselves those rules all of a sudden

00:14:10.018 --> 00:14:14.578
Caption: don&#39;t seem to apply anymore

00:14:12.838 --> 00:14:16.138
Caption: which is why I&#39;m still having imposter

00:14:14.578 --> 00:14:18.359
Caption: feelings

00:14:16.138 --> 00:14:19.979
Caption: but there are um specifically two

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:21.299
Caption: exercises that I wanted to share with

00:14:19.979 --> 00:14:24.059
Caption: you all that have been really helpful

00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:25.380
Caption: for myself but also um clients that I

00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:28.200
Caption: have treated in the past with similar

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.299
Caption: issues and these are exercises that are

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.679
Caption: part of cognitive behavioral therapy and

00:14:30.299 --> 00:14:32.458
Caption: I will really do a deep dive into that

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:35.278
Caption: because I could do a whole different

00:14:32.458 --> 00:14:38.880
Caption: talk about that but I will give a brief

00:14:35.278 --> 00:14:41.518
Caption: overview of these exercises and I have

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.380
Caption: added a QR code for you to scan so you

00:14:41.518 --> 00:14:45.778
Caption: can find some worksheets related to them

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.880
Caption: as well and you can look it up yourself

00:14:45.778 --> 00:14:49.260
Caption: so the first one is cognitive

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.940
Caption: restructuring

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.919
Caption: oh everybody&#39;s putting up their phone

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.739
Caption: that&#39;s cool

00:14:52.919 --> 00:14:57.539
Caption: and cognitive restructuring is a way to

00:14:55.739 --> 00:14:58.979
Caption: really get to the root of why you are

00:14:57.539 --> 00:15:00.659
Caption: having this imposter feeling in the

00:14:58.979 --> 00:15:01.799
Caption: first place and how you came to believe

00:15:00.659 --> 00:15:03.838
Caption: them

00:15:01.799 --> 00:15:07.198
Caption: so you&#39;re kind of using this technique

00:15:03.838 --> 00:15:09.239
Caption: called Socratic questioning where you

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:11.278
Caption: just challenge the thought that you&#39;re

00:15:09.239 --> 00:15:13.799
Caption: having at the moment you might ask

00:15:11.278 --> 00:15:16.859
Caption: yourself questions like is this thought

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:18.359
Caption: based on emotions or facts do I can I

00:15:16.859 --> 00:15:20.278
Caption: think of any facts that actually support

00:15:18.359 --> 00:15:22.320
Caption: this thought that I&#39;m having or can I

00:15:20.278 --> 00:15:24.778
Caption: think of any facts that

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.880
Caption: um support the fact that I that it&#39;s not

00:15:24.778 --> 00:15:29.039
Caption: true what I&#39;m thinking and it&#39;s those

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.018
Caption: kinds of questions that will help you

00:15:29.039 --> 00:15:32.458
Caption: um kind of like get to the bottom of

00:15:31.018 --> 00:15:34.919
Caption: this in a slightly more objective way

00:15:32.458 --> 00:15:36.898
Caption: which have been quite helpful for me

00:15:34.919 --> 00:15:39.000
Caption: and the next exercise is called

00:15:36.898 --> 00:15:40.919
Caption: dysfunctional thought record

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.880
Caption: it&#39;s the same QR Code by the way so you

00:15:40.919 --> 00:15:44.299
Caption: don&#39;t have to scan it again if you

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.919
Caption: already have it

00:15:44.299 --> 00:15:49.138
Caption: this functional thought record really

00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:52.440
Caption: helps you find out what triggers your

00:15:49.138 --> 00:15:53.880
Caption: imposter thought it asks you to write

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.159
Caption: down things like the time and date of

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.320
Caption: your thoughts what the thought is how

00:15:56.159 --> 00:16:00.119
Caption: you would rate its intensity and

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.398
Caption: emotions that come with it but the most

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:04.859
Caption: important part of this one is that you

00:16:02.398 --> 00:16:07.380
Caption: think of alternative thoughts that could

00:16:04.859 --> 00:16:10.398
Caption: actually be more positive or helpful to

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.398
Caption: replace your negative one

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:16.440
Caption: well now so far I have been giving you a

00:16:14.338 --> 00:16:17.940
Caption: lot of tips to handle impulsive Feelings

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.440
Caption: by yourself and this is probably a lot

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.958
Caption: of the stuff that you can find online as

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.940
Caption: well but one of the things that I find

00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.198
Caption: is really important here is that

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.698
Caption: leadership can actually have an

00:16:25.198 --> 00:16:30.078
Caption: important role in helping other people

00:16:26.698 --> 00:16:30.078
Caption: with impossive feelings too

00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:35.638
Caption: and so leaders why should you help out

00:16:33.239 --> 00:16:37.919
Caption: others with impulsive feelings because

00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:40.739
Caption: it actually turns out in research that

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:43.619
Caption: imposter feelings impact the performance

00:16:40.739 --> 00:16:45.838
Caption: of both the individual and the team it&#39;s

00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:48.059
Caption: actually correlated with job poor job

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:50.479
Caption: performance poor job satisfaction and

00:16:48.059 --> 00:16:50.479
Caption: burnout

00:16:51.059 --> 00:16:55.989
Caption: so it&#39;s important to learn and to

00:16:52.919 --> 00:16:58.859
Caption: identify impulsive feelings in others

00:16:55.989 --> 00:17:00.299
Caption: [Music]

00:16:58.859 --> 00:17:02.479
Caption: I need a little bit of help with this

00:17:00.299 --> 00:17:02.479
Caption: one

00:17:04.798 --> 00:17:08.639
Caption: so impossible feelings can be quite

00:17:06.719 --> 00:17:11.159
Caption: complex and sometimes not even that

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.938
Caption: obvious your team member may seem

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:16.559
Caption: fatigued or disinterested or um maybe

00:17:14.938 --> 00:17:19.520
Caption: just completely the opposite and really

00:17:16.558 --> 00:17:22.739
Caption: on top of things and and going Beyond

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.838
Caption: above and beyond to try and just do the

00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:26.760
Caption: right thing and and

00:17:24.838 --> 00:17:30.000
Caption: um

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:32.280
Caption: so that they can prove their worth

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.558
Caption: um but what about the high performer who

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.640
Caption: tends to avoid these like more tricky

00:17:34.558 --> 00:17:38.159
Caption: projects

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:40.200
Caption: or the person who doesn&#39;t put their hand

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.919
Caption: up for a promotion

00:17:40.199 --> 00:17:45.659
Caption: or the person who look seems to be

00:17:43.918 --> 00:17:49.439
Caption: uncomfortable with praise and kind of

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.820
Caption: just like waves it off as luck or uh

00:17:49.439 --> 00:17:53.399
Caption: something that they got a lot of help

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:55.439
Caption: from other people or maybe they just

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:59.059
Caption: appear really skeptical when you

00:17:55.439 --> 00:17:59.058
Caption: encourage them to do something new

00:17:59.939 --> 00:18:04.859
Caption: you also want to stay attuned to

00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:07.918
Caption: negative self-talk things like oh silly

00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:10.400
Caption: question or had it really terrible on

00:18:07.918 --> 00:18:13.798
Caption: that presentation

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.299
Caption: or someone could probably someone better

00:18:13.798 --> 00:18:17.519
Caption: should probably be doing this or someone

00:18:15.298 --> 00:18:19.439
Caption: else should probably be doing this are

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.500
Caption: really good examples of self-deprecating

00:18:19.439 --> 00:18:25.639
Caption: talk and can be harmful for a team

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.640
Caption: members performance as well

00:18:27.418 --> 00:18:32.339
Caption: but to be fair it can be pretty hard to

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:35.460
Caption: walk up to a manager and talk about

00:18:32.339 --> 00:18:38.159
Caption: these kinds of feelings right so as a

00:18:35.459 --> 00:18:39.058
Caption: manager you want to be if you want to be

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.979
Caption: able to have these kinds of

00:18:39.058 --> 00:18:43.140
Caption: conversations you want to show empathy

00:18:40.979 --> 00:18:44.760
Caption: and vulnerability and that means that

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.739
Caption: you might have to open up about your

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.359
Caption: imposter feelings first before someone

00:18:46.739 --> 00:18:50.538
Caption: else feels comfortable enough to come to

00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:50.538
Caption: you

00:18:52.619 --> 00:18:56.280
Caption: so when a team member does come to you

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.679
Caption: it&#39;s important that you acknowledge

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.840
Caption: their feelings and maybe share one of

00:18:58.678 --> 00:19:03.779
Caption: your own experiences oh I need to wrap

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:05.900
Caption: this up apparently quick you want to

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.160
Caption: organize appropriate mentoring

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.960
Caption: and this doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.340
Caption: a senior person this can be anyone on

00:19:09.959 --> 00:19:13.859
Caption: your team who maybe have slightly more

00:19:11.339 --> 00:19:16.079
Caption: experience than the person who&#39;s just

00:19:13.859 --> 00:19:17.520
Caption: joining

00:19:16.079 --> 00:19:19.260
Caption: you want to get feedback from team

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.179
Caption: members about the work environment so

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.739
Caption: one thing that my new VP of engineering

00:19:21.178 --> 00:19:25.678
Caption: recently did was just have a chat with

00:19:22.739 --> 00:19:27.058
Caption: all of us and ask questions like what do

00:19:25.678 --> 00:19:28.918
Caption: I do when you&#39;re grumpy should I just

00:19:27.058 --> 00:19:31.918
Caption: come up to you leave you alone send you

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:34.019
Caption: a message how do you like to to get

00:19:31.918 --> 00:19:35.759
Caption: praised do you like that one-on-one am I

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.679
Caption: is it okay if I share this stuff in a

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.320
Caption: team things like that can all go a long

00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:43.439
Caption: way to make a person more comfortable

00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:45.659
Caption: with these sort of situations

00:19:43.439 --> 00:19:47.579
Caption: and you want to of course give praise to

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.780
Caption: and celebrate wins with your entire team

00:19:47.579 --> 00:19:51.058
Caption: in the way that they all feel

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.460
Caption: comfortable with

00:19:51.058 --> 00:19:55.319
Caption: so quick recap

00:19:53.459 --> 00:19:57.839
Caption: um impossible feelings and dealing with

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:59.099
Caption: them can be quite hard but if you can

00:19:57.839 --> 00:20:01.798
Caption: acknowledge them that is the first step

00:19:59.099 --> 00:20:03.619
Caption: towards actually dealing with them and

00:20:01.798 --> 00:20:06.779
Caption: over time you&#39;ll notice that your

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:08.339
Caption: moments will last will be shorter and

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.239
Caption: shorter and you&#39;ll have less and less of

00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:13.739
Caption: them

00:20:09.239 --> 00:20:15.298
Caption: you can do things like managing

00:20:13.739 --> 00:20:17.760
Caption: all these things that I just previously

00:20:15.298 --> 00:20:19.699
Caption: mentioned that&#39;s what you can do

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.079
Caption: laughs

00:20:19.699 --> 00:20:24.178
Caption: but I do really wanted to say this

00:20:22.079 --> 00:20:26.519
Caption: before I step off stage and give it to

00:20:24.178 --> 00:20:28.558
Caption: someone else it is okay to ask for

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.260
Caption: professional help as well dealing with

00:20:28.558 --> 00:20:33.538
Caption: imposter syndrome can be hard and to be

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.820
Caption: honest I have actually have seen a

00:20:33.538 --> 00:20:37.319
Caption: counselor myself to deal with some

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:39.599
Caption: similar kind of issues and I found that

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:42.359
Caption: it&#39;s been really really helpful for me

00:20:39.599 --> 00:20:44.400
Caption: uh well thank you unfortunately I can&#39;t

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:46.380
