Caption: all right welcome to my talk about how

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:06.659
Caption: to design a prize draw randomizer

00:00:05.119 --> 00:00:09.840
Caption: without bugs

00:00:06.659 --> 00:00:12.079
Caption: [Laughter]

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.840

Caption: take you on a little journey which is

00:00:36.398 --> 00:00:39.839
Caption: the journey of your career

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.840
Caption: if i asked you all now to take a moment

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.160
Caption: and think about how your career&#39;s gone

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.840
Caption: what would you think about

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.599
Caption: you might be thinking about

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.279
Caption: what skills have i learnt that i didn&#39;t

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:55.680
Caption: know before

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:58.159
Caption: how much has my salary increased since i

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.119
Caption: started and was i able to provide for my

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.359
Caption: loved ones and my lifestyle

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:04.798
Caption: how many promotions did i have

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.799
Caption: did i get recognized for my

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.720
Caption: contributions

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.960
Caption: what projects have i worked on and how

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.360
Caption: have i changed the world

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:16.478
Caption: did i end up where i wanted to be

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.239
Caption: and am i doing what i want to do in life

00:01:16.478 --> 00:01:20.719
Caption: these are all very valuable things to

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:22.399
Caption: reflect on and things that are important

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.080
Caption: in in our lives

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.559
Caption: but i noticed something when reflecting

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.240
Caption: upon this question myself

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:30.478
Caption: it isn&#39;t often that we stop to think

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:31.519
Caption: about how our careers have changed us as

00:01:30.478 --> 00:01:33.279
Caption: people

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:34.959
Caption: and also how we&#39;ve changed other

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:36.400
Caption: people&#39;s lives

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:38.839
Caption: we don&#39;t often think about the

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.880
Caption: uniqueness of our full selves and our

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:43.438
Caption: experiences and what these are brought

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:43.438
Caption: to the table

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.839
Caption: now being somewhat of a geek and a game

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.240
Caption: developer i found it easier to

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:55.000
Caption: understand this when i visualized career

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:55.000
Caption: journeys like video games

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:59.438
Caption: so what we bring to our careers starts

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.399
Caption: well before we even get our very first

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.560
Caption: job

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.840
Caption: we start off with from birth some things

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:05.438
Caption: that have been

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:07.359
Caption: out of your control

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.680
Caption: someone&#39;s rolled the random selection

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.160
Caption: and chosen for you your genetics

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:16.799
Caption: your family background

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.800
Caption: and your country or your culture

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.440
Caption: and these factors can have a big impact

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.279
Caption: on what our interests traits

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.958
Caption: values and morals will be

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.479
Caption: a little bit of nature and a little bit

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:30.559
Caption: of nurture

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:32.238
Caption: i&#39;ll call these things our initial stats

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:34.399
Caption: maybe you grew up in a family of

00:02:32.238 --> 00:02:36.878
Caption: technically minded people who taught you

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:39.679
Caption: from a young age things like maths and

00:02:36.878 --> 00:02:42.958
Caption: chemistry and even programming and had

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:44.878
Caption: grand expectations of you

00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:46.720
Caption: or maybe you grew up in a family full of

00:02:44.878 --> 00:02:47.839
Caption: sporty-minded people where you were the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.919
Caption: black sheep

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:51.679
Caption: clinging to your nintendo and your crt

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.800
Caption: monitor much to the dismay of your

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.559
Caption: family

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.760
Caption: or maybe you had nothing to do with

00:02:54.559 --> 00:03:00.080
Caption: technology until much later in life

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:02.839
Caption: factors such as those and how we respond

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.598
Caption: to them have an impact on stats like our

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:07.759
Caption: confidence our independence

00:03:05.598 --> 00:03:08.958
Caption: our willpower and ability to overcome

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.720
Caption: challenge

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.720
Caption: how we deal with pressure

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.000
Caption: and our range of complementary or world

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.000
Caption: knowledge

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.839
Caption: and they can also instill in us values

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.839
Caption: of what we find important in life

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.598
Caption: now we progress through our main

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:25.119
Caption: storyline with these stats and this

00:03:23.598 --> 00:03:27.679
Caption: involves a typical

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:30.080
Caption: childhood school high school and

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:31.679
Caption: university before we get to work

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.759
Caption: there&#39;s also a whole bunch of little

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:35.439
Caption: side quests that pop up and have an

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.399
Caption: effect on you whether you realize it or

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.238
Caption: not

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:40.479
Caption: those are things like that time you move

00:03:38.238 --> 00:03:43.279
Caption: schools that time you stood up to a

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:45.598
Caption: bully that time you won a scholarship or

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:47.518
Caption: that time you failed an exam

00:03:45.598 --> 00:03:49.279
Caption: all of these can have a profound effect

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:52.878
Caption: on shaping up these stats that

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.878
Caption: collectively make up who you are

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:56.720
Caption: and then finally we enter the kingdom of

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:58.479
Caption: work

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.919
Caption: now i just want to examine our stats a

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.360
Caption: bit here because i feel like this is

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.639
Caption: where people are missing out on some

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.720
Caption: things

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.479
Caption: society tends to have some stereotypic

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.958
Caption: stereotypical views about what makes

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:12.238
Caption: people successful in their careers

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:13.598
Caption: traits such as confident intelligent

00:04:12.238 --> 00:04:17.359
Caption: hard-working

00:04:13.598 --> 00:04:19.359
Caption: well-spoken collaborative and focused

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.119
Caption: a lot of people i&#39;ve met focus on these

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.559
Caption: sorts of things and think they&#39;re

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:24.559
Caption: lacking

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:25.759
Caption: they lack the confidence needed to climb

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:27.600
Caption: up the ladder

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.479
Caption: or they aren&#39;t as smart as everyone else

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.839
Caption: in the room

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.839
Caption: or they like working on their own

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:36.638
Caption: i remember interviewing multiple people

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:38.239
Caption: for a technical role a few years back

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.040
Caption: it was a role that required some

00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:42.479
Caption: advanced mathematics skills for robotics

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.800
Caption: kinematics

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.839
Caption: and we interviewed some people who had

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:49.599
Caption: phds and advanced degrees in maths very

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:51.839
Caption: very impressive on paper

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.320
Caption: we presented them with a fairly basic

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:56.639
Caption: trigonometry challenge to start it&#39;s my

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.639
Caption: trigosaurus i&#39;m very proud of that

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.080
Caption: um it was quite interesting to see the

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.720
Caption: people who had some people who had the

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:05.519
Caption: advanced degrees and phds going about

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.079
Caption: the challenge in a very complicated way

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:09.679
Caption: and quite confidently i might add

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:11.119
Caption: and then eventually becoming defeated

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:12.559
Caption: when they realized they didn&#39;t know how

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:14.479
Caption: to do it

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:16.720
Caption: on the flip side you had people who had

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.119
Caption: much less academic experience or were

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.440
Caption: less confident and had only high school

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:24.000
Caption: mathematics skills who were able to

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.759
Caption: complete the challenge successfully

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.759
Caption: we also had people who completed it

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.519
Caption: successfully in simply saying

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.759
Caption: i don&#39;t know the equation to this but

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:34.559
Caption: this is what i do

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.000
Caption: it was a case of very educated people

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:38.720
Caption: over complicating something that was

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.559
Caption: actually quite simple and perhaps their

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.639
Caption: exposure to complicated questions

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:45.039
Caption: prompted them to assume the answer was

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.800
Caption: similarly complicated

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.199
Caption: definitely in some situations you

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:51.519
Caption: absolutely do need those complicated

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.199
Caption: solutions but in this example high

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:55.599
Caption: academic knowledge didn&#39;t guarantee

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.759
Caption: real-world success while a simpler view

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.839
Caption: of the world mixed with things like

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.239
Caption: calmness under pressure or critical

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:04.239
Caption: thinking was effective

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:07.519
Caption: there are often times many ways to

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:09.199
Caption: achieve an outcome

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:11.440
Caption: confidence is a big one that people

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.679
Caption: dislike about themselves

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.360
Caption: when preparing this presentation i asked

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:18.239
Caption: a bunch of people that i know about

00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:20.959
Caption: their best and worst work-related traits

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:22.399
Caption: and this was by far the most popular um

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:23.679
Caption: disliked trait that people had of

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:25.199
Caption: themselves

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:26.959
Caption: funnily enough it was mentioned by

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.479
Caption: someone who i was actually going to use

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:30.079
Caption: as an example

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.839
Caption: she said she doesn&#39;t have enough

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:35.198
Caption: confidence and likes to validate

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:37.119
Caption: things i worked with this person for

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.119
Caption: about a year and a half

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:41.440
Caption: and she similar to me is more of an

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:43.679
Caption: anxious worrisome person

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.679
Caption: we worked in a very physically high risk

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:47.919
Caption: environment and understandably that made

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:49.839
Caption: us both even more stressed out as

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:52.319
Caption: worrisome people

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:54.399
Caption: some people wanted to steam ahead and

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.799
Caption: a handful like her tried to keep up with

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:59.440
Caption: the pace while focusing on things like

00:06:56.799 --> 00:07:01.679
Caption: doing things safely on ensuring our code

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.279
Caption: had tests double and triple and

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:05.359
Caption: quadruple checking everything and

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:06.720
Caption: looking out for everyone

00:07:05.359 --> 00:07:08.638
Caption: she&#39;s someone who would always think of

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.319
Caption: worst case scenarios and would try to

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:11.598
Caption: mitigate them

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:13.440
Caption: but the fact that she overthinks

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:16.239
Caption: sometimes and needs to validate

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.919
Caption: everything can be so valuable they are

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:20.479
Caption: massive strengths

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:22.240
Caption: it not only kept us physically safer but

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:25.119
Caption: it also made us made me feel more

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:26.479
Caption: relaxed knowing that she was around

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:28.959
Caption: knowing that there was someone there who

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:31.759
Caption: was that observant and cautious made me

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:33.679
Caption: feel safer

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:35.598
Caption: so while we need to not let those kind

00:07:33.679 --> 00:07:37.519
Caption: of things affect our lives in negative

00:07:35.598 --> 00:07:39.519
Caption: ways this points out something very

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:42.160
Caption: advantageous about you

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:44.959
Caption: not everyone is capable of that extent

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.598
Caption: of empathy awareness of risks and

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:49.359
Caption: urgency to resolve issues

00:07:47.598 --> 00:07:51.839
Caption: people who don&#39;t have confidence levels

00:07:49.359 --> 00:07:52.719
Caption: at 100 are extremely valuable in other

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:54.479
Caption: ways

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.639
Caption: sometimes actually because they don&#39;t

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:59.839
Caption: have 100 points of confidence and

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:59.839
Caption: shouldn&#39;t feel like they&#39;re lacking

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:03.119
Caption: you have the same thing with company

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:04.720
Caption: direction

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:07.519
Caption: there will always be some people who

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.440
Caption: have big visions and say things like yes

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:10.720
Caption: yes absolutely we can do that for you in

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.720
Caption: two months

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.799
Caption: and then you&#39;ll have other people who

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.799
Caption: would shudder and say the same thing

00:08:14.799 --> 00:08:18.720
Caption: needs to be scoped out thoroughly and

00:08:16.799 --> 00:08:21.759
Caption: estimated and they&#39;ll probably come back

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.199
Caption: with a timeline more like four years

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:25.279
Caption: i know you probably all have stories

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:27.039
Caption: similar to that one um

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:29.759
Caption: we need both those people

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:32.640
Caption: we need people who are risk takers who

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:34.640
Caption: are enthusiastic and like to please

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.519
Caption: and we need people who are grounded who

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.679
Caption: are risk averse and are more cautious

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:41.518
Caption: this is a fantastic combination of

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:43.919
Caption: different people who have different

00:08:41.518 --> 00:08:43.919
Caption: strengths

00:08:44.158 --> 00:08:48.320
Caption: so if we examine again our stats we

00:08:46.239 --> 00:08:50.640
Caption: should realize that these stereotypical

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.958
Caption: ones are barely scratching the surface

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.799
Caption: of what makes people successful

00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.479
Caption: accomplished and valuable

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:58.640
Caption: there are a whole lot more things that

00:08:56.479 --> 00:09:01.760
Caption: you offer and some of those are actually

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.799
Caption: things you think are weaknesses

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.559
Caption: so how can you reflect on this

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:08.559
Caption: think about each thing that you&#39;ve ever

00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:10.559
Caption: thought was your weakness

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:12.799
Caption: and then ask yourself

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:15.518
Caption: if a person like this this joined my

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:17.119
Caption: team what would i get them to work on

00:09:15.518 --> 00:09:18.719
Caption: and why

00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:20.799
Caption: because sometimes i find it&#39;s much

00:09:18.719 --> 00:09:23.838
Caption: easier to think rationally when it&#39;s

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:25.838
Caption: less personal for you

00:09:23.838 --> 00:09:28.799
Caption: for me i always used to think to myself

00:09:25.838 --> 00:09:30.799
Caption: wow my memory is really poor i can never

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:31.838
Caption: absorb things that i read about or hear

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:34.320
Caption: about

00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:36.479
Caption: i&#39;m anxious and i worry a lot

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.958
Caption: i have difficulty focusing in meetings

00:09:36.479 --> 00:09:40.719
Caption: and miss a lot of what&#39;s going on

00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:43.679
Caption: i surrounded myself with highly

00:09:40.719 --> 00:09:45.039
Caption: intelligent people and always felt very

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:47.359
Caption: inadequate

00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:49.119
Caption: how did i even get this far

00:09:47.359 --> 00:09:50.880
Caption: and i realized that well maybe those

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:52.159
Caption: things aren&#39;t actually the only recipe

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.679
Caption: to success

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:56.079
Caption: maybe i have some other stuff going on

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:56.080
Caption: for me

00:09:56.159 --> 00:10:00.879
Caption: my memory is poor but i would sometimes

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:03.759
Caption: take great notes to make up for that

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.679
Caption: notes which other people needed as well

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.078
Caption: it also made me great at learning how to

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:10.559
Caption: teach things simply because which many

00:10:08.078 --> 00:10:12.479
Caption: of my fellow human beings need because i

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:14.320
Caption: understood what they&#39;d have difficulty

00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:16.639
Caption: with

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.239
Caption: i worry a lot and people

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.079
Caption: for some reason tend to make me in

00:10:18.239 --> 00:10:22.000
Caption: charge of quality assurance for some

00:10:20.078 --> 00:10:23.440
Caption: reason because i can be quite pedantic

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.518
Caption: about it

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.919
Caption: i have difficulty focusing but i like

00:10:25.518 --> 00:10:29.599
Caption: when people are concise and to the point

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:31.119
Caption: and it means i filter out things that

00:10:29.599 --> 00:10:32.880
Caption: maybe aren&#39;t the top priority to me

00:10:31.119 --> 00:10:34.799
Caption: right now and focus on things i actually

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.479
Caption: do need to know

00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:37.599
Caption: it&#39;s also because sometimes my brain is

00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:39.919
Caption: thinking about a hundred different

00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:44.159
Caption: things at once and that in itself is

00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:45.679
Caption: hectic but also kind of awesome in a way

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:47.759
Caption: i surround myself with highly

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:49.359
Caption: intelligent people and learn to

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.440
Caption: appreciate that if i&#39;m sitting at a

00:10:49.359 --> 00:10:52.719
Caption: table with them and i&#39;ve been there for

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.239
Caption: quite a while

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:55.759
Caption: then it probably means i have something

00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:58.958
Caption: equivalent to that which i bring to the

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.640
Caption: table and that makes me kind of proud

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.239
Caption: so i want to surround myself with even

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.799
Caption: more impressive people because that

00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:06.320
Caption: means i&#39;m leveling up in my own way and

00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:08.559
Caption: i can also learn a hell of a lot from

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.559
Caption: them

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.200
Caption: focusing on what we lack can sometimes

00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:15.039
Caption: prompt us into improving ourselves

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.278
Caption: but if we forgot forget to focus on what

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:18.159
Caption: we do have and what our strength really

00:11:17.278 --> 00:11:20.239
Caption: is in

00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:22.159
Caption: then we can really lose out

00:11:20.239 --> 00:11:25.919
Caption: your collection of strengths

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:25.919
Caption: is a lot bigger than you realize

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:30.319
Caption: so now that we know about your important

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:33.278
Caption: part in your journey let&#39;s look at take

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.278
Caption: a look at things around you

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.919
Caption: as we&#39;ve seen it&#39;s important to observe

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.518
Caption: different types of strengths and this is

00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:40.958
Caption: true too when you look at other people

00:11:39.518 --> 00:11:43.039
Caption: around you in your career not just

00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:46.559
Caption: yourself you don&#39;t want the people

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:48.239
Caption: around you to be exactly the same as you

00:11:46.559 --> 00:11:50.159
Caption: rather you actually go a lot more when

00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:52.000
Caption: they&#39;re very different to you

00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:54.719
Caption: and companies with the best culture tend

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.638
Caption: to recognize this

00:11:54.719 --> 00:11:58.879
Caption: so in a game a party is meant to be a

00:11:56.638 --> 00:12:02.320
Caption: group of players who have complementary

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:04.559
Caption: skills and work towards a common goal

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.320
Caption: you have tanks who are there to protect

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:08.078
Caption: the other players and take most of the

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.160
Caption: hits

00:12:08.078 --> 00:12:11.679
Caption: you have mages who can deal damage from

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:13.518
Caption: far away

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:15.278
Caption: and you have supporting classes like

00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:16.638
Caption: healers who are there to keep everyone

00:12:15.278 --> 00:12:18.719
Caption: alive

00:12:16.638 --> 00:12:22.638
Caption: these are their strengths and they each

00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:22.638
Caption: have different roles to play in the game

00:12:22.719 --> 00:12:25.919
Caption: now if you had a party made up of purely

00:12:24.719 --> 00:12:28.159
Caption: tanks

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:30.000
Caption: you might tackle some of these um the

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:31.919
Caption: easier challenges pretty quickly but

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.200
Caption: you&#39;ll probably all end up dying later

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.880
Caption: on

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.958
Caption: and the same goes for if you had a party

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.880
Caption: made up of entirely healers

00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.320
Caption: you&#39;d probably never die to be fair but

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.160
Caption: you probably wouldn&#39;t go anywhere very

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.000
Caption: quickly

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:45.679
Caption: so a party is meant to have people with

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.518
Caption: different strengths so that you can

00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:50.638
Caption: cover all the bases and face different

00:12:47.518 --> 00:12:52.320
Caption: types of challenges together

00:12:50.638 --> 00:12:54.078
Caption: and then in addition to your party you

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.600
Caption: can also see people like your managers

00:12:54.078 --> 00:12:57.518
Caption: as quest givers

00:12:55.599 --> 00:13:01.359
Caption: they give you direction the goals to

00:12:57.518 --> 00:13:01.359
Caption: accomplish and resources to do so

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.359
Caption: but how do those different types of

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:06.799
Caption: people change you as a person

00:13:05.359 --> 00:13:09.039
Caption: because you don&#39;t come out of your

00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:12.000
Caption: careers with the exact same set of stats

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:13.199
Caption: that you started with

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.799
Caption: how about when you&#39;re tackling some

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.639
Caption: enemies

00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:18.880
Caption: so some of your party will be there to

00:13:16.638 --> 00:13:20.719
Caption: give you support and some will require

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.638
Caption: your support

00:13:20.719 --> 00:13:24.398
Caption: each time you provide support to a party

00:13:22.638 --> 00:13:25.759
Caption: member you are actually strengthening

00:13:24.398 --> 00:13:28.398
Caption: your own stats

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.760
Caption: it&#39;s not a one-way relationship

00:13:28.398 --> 00:13:31.119
Caption: you are increasing your points in

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.398
Caption: communication

00:13:31.119 --> 00:13:34.559
Caption: mentoring

00:13:32.398 --> 00:13:37.359
Caption: and oftentimes your own understanding of

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:39.119
Caption: what you&#39;re helping them out with

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:41.039
Caption: how many times have you been asked a

00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:43.440
Caption: question by someone and started to

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:45.518
Caption: explain only to realize you didn&#39;t

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.958
Caption: really know how to explain it that well

00:13:45.518 --> 00:13:48.078
Caption: sometimes that&#39;s an indication that you

00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.838
Caption: don&#39;t actually know it well enough

00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:51.359
Caption: yourself

00:13:49.838 --> 00:13:52.638
Caption: or sometimes you&#39;ll explain something to

00:13:51.359 --> 00:13:54.719
Caption: others and realize you do actually know

00:13:52.638 --> 00:13:56.638
Caption: what you&#39;re talking about

00:13:54.719 --> 00:13:58.319
Caption: sometimes you&#39;ll ask them for assistance

00:13:56.638 --> 00:14:00.880
Caption: and actually answer your own question in

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.880
Caption: the process

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.199
Caption: now because everyone&#39;s different you

00:14:03.278 --> 00:14:07.359
Caption: also learn to adapt in the ways that you

00:14:05.198 --> 00:14:10.078
Caption: interact with them that&#39;s a plus one to

00:14:07.359 --> 00:14:11.599
Caption: your perception and adaptation

00:14:10.078 --> 00:14:13.599
Caption: this is especially hard when you have to

00:14:11.599 --> 00:14:15.679
Caption: give someone difficult feedback or

00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:16.799
Caption: constructive criticism

00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:19.359
Caption: you&#39;re forced to

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:21.359
Caption: improve your diplomacy and your logic

00:14:19.359 --> 00:14:23.760
Caption: to avoid confrontations and the wrong

00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:25.919
Caption: message being sent

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.160
Caption: empathy is also something that i find

00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:29.599
Caption: greatly grows when you work closely in a

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:31.359
Caption: team

00:14:29.599 --> 00:14:33.599
Caption: the dunning-kruger effect suggests that

00:14:31.359 --> 00:14:34.719
Caption: the more we know the more we realize we

00:14:33.599 --> 00:14:36.000
Caption: don&#39;t know

00:14:34.719 --> 00:14:37.039
Caption: and for some of you it makes you more

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.799
Caption: humble

00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:40.880
Caption: but it also gives us empathy for our

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:42.719
Caption: fellow party members

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.039
Caption: we understand the difficult tasks

00:14:42.719 --> 00:14:46.719
Caption: they&#39;ve been they&#39;ve been given we see

00:14:45.039 --> 00:14:48.880
Caption: the long hours they work

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:51.198
Caption: and understand that maybe their manager

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.799
Caption: under-appreciates them

00:14:51.198 --> 00:14:54.159
Caption: when we realize how difficult something

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:55.679
Caption: like coding is

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:56.638
Caption: we learn to appreciate everyone who does

00:14:55.679 --> 00:15:00.719
Caption: it too

00:14:56.638 --> 00:15:00.719
Caption: because what we do it is not easy

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:05.679
Caption: but the most important thing i found out

00:15:03.599 --> 00:15:08.559
Caption: about people around me was that they

00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:10.719
Caption: taught me who i want to be as a person

00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:12.559
Caption: you meet people who inspire you people

00:15:10.719 --> 00:15:13.919
Caption: you admire

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:16.000
Caption: and also people who show you who you

00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:18.159
Caption: don&#39;t want to be

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.078
Caption: i appreciated friendly and approachable

00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:21.278
Caption: leaders and wanted to be like them one

00:15:20.078 --> 00:15:22.958
Caption: day

00:15:21.278 --> 00:15:25.039
Caption: i saw many team members who were

00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.559
Caption: overlooked in terms of the difficulty

00:15:25.039 --> 00:15:28.479
Caption: the work they were doing and the effort

00:15:26.559 --> 00:15:31.518
Caption: they put in and i always try to remind

00:15:28.479 --> 00:15:33.119
Caption: myself to appreciate them

00:15:31.518 --> 00:15:35.039
Caption: i realize that things are rarely ever

00:15:33.119 --> 00:15:36.799
Caption: the fault of a single person and that

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:38.958
Caption: usually we&#39;re all trying to accomplish

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:41.758
Caption: common core goals just in different ways

00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:44.000
Caption: not to sabotage one another

00:15:41.758 --> 00:15:45.679
Caption: i saw toxic and abusive behavior and i

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.719
Caption: realized that after years of being quite

00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:48.559
Caption: submissive

00:15:46.719 --> 00:15:51.679
Caption: that i was no longer able to tolerate

00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:54.239
Caption: that and was able to stand up for others

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:56.159
Caption: i took those interactions with people

00:15:54.239 --> 00:15:57.599
Caption: far beyond my workplace and into my

00:15:56.159 --> 00:15:59.758
Caption: everyday life

00:15:57.599 --> 00:16:02.479
Caption: i realized more about who i wanted to be

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:02.479
Caption: as a person

00:16:03.198 --> 00:16:06.479
Caption: so what about them

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.160
Caption: as we saw earlier

00:16:06.479 --> 00:16:09.758
Caption: working with someone is not a one-way

00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:11.838
Caption: relationship

00:16:09.758 --> 00:16:14.638
Caption: actions that you take in your career can

00:16:11.838 --> 00:16:16.958
Caption: change other people&#39;s lives too

00:16:14.638 --> 00:16:18.958
Caption: you are an important part of their quest

00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.398
Caption: because every party member is a player

00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.398
Caption: in their own journey

00:16:20.398 --> 00:16:23.919
Caption: each with their own set of stats

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:25.758
Caption: fears and goals

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:28.078
Caption: we want each one of your party to level

00:16:25.758 --> 00:16:30.159
Caption: up and accomplish great things and have

00:16:28.078 --> 00:16:31.758
Caption: fun doing it

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:33.518
Caption: so what are some things that you do that

00:16:31.758 --> 00:16:35.359
Caption: proactively makes other people&#39;s lives

00:16:33.518 --> 00:16:36.638
Caption: better

00:16:35.359 --> 00:16:39.039
Caption: something i found to be a little

00:16:36.638 --> 00:16:41.119
Caption: underrated um is fostering good team

00:16:39.039 --> 00:16:42.799
Caption: culture

00:16:41.119 --> 00:16:44.479
Caption: good culture for me is what makes me

00:16:42.799 --> 00:16:46.159
Caption: want to get out of bed in the morning

00:16:44.479 --> 00:16:48.000
Caption: and come to work

00:16:46.159 --> 00:16:49.599
Caption: we all know we need the money

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.958
Caption: but working with people that you get

00:16:49.599 --> 00:16:53.198
Caption: along with

00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:55.198
Caption: makes it far less of a chore

00:16:53.198 --> 00:16:56.799
Caption: so when you make people laugh you

00:16:55.198 --> 00:16:58.159
Caption: actually make the work environment more

00:16:56.799 --> 00:17:00.320
Caption: relaxed

00:16:58.159 --> 00:17:01.758
Caption: when you organize social events make

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.518
Caption: friendly banter

00:17:01.758 --> 00:17:04.798
Caption: welcome new people and make them feel

00:17:03.518 --> 00:17:07.038
Caption: comfortable

00:17:04.798 --> 00:17:09.599
Caption: and encourage a collaborative no blame

00:17:07.038 --> 00:17:11.438
Caption: environment then this is all part of it

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:14.160
Caption: so are you someone who builds on the

00:17:11.438 --> 00:17:14.159
Caption: team&#39;s culture

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.438
Caption: have you ever gone out of your way to

00:17:15.838 --> 00:17:19.280
Caption: help someone with the task that they

00:17:17.438 --> 00:17:21.760
Caption: were stressing about

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.439
Caption: perhaps they had some tight deadlines or

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.798
Caption: they were really unsure about how to do

00:17:23.438 --> 00:17:26.479
Caption: something

00:17:24.798 --> 00:17:28.318
Caption: i&#39;m sure you had your own tasks to do

00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:30.558
Caption: but you still took some time out of your

00:17:28.318 --> 00:17:31.678
Caption: day to help them

00:17:30.558 --> 00:17:33.839
Caption: and to be honest this can have

00:17:31.678 --> 00:17:36.319
Caption: ramifications so much deeper than their

00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:38.558
Caption: deliverables being delivered this has an

00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:40.959
Caption: effect on their stress levels their

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:42.399
Caption: work-life balance and also their mental

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:44.000
Caption: well-being

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.160
Caption: not only have you helped them with their

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.839
Caption: actual task you have shown them that

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.840
Caption: they are not alone

00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:51.918
Caption: they have someone&#39;s support

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:54.319
Caption: they are part of your team and you have

00:17:51.918 --> 00:17:54.319
Caption: their back

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.959
Caption: every time you mentor someone to upskill

00:17:57.359 --> 00:18:00.479
Caption: them you are helping to increase their

00:17:58.959 --> 00:18:02.000
Caption: overall stats

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:03.760
Caption: you are sharing some of your past

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.839
Caption: experience with them and how you

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.520
Caption: overcame your challenges as well

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:09.520
Caption: this is often much faster than if they

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.520
Caption: went it alone and it&#39;s basically a way

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:15.200
Caption: of duplicating your stats and your

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:17.599
Caption: experience and passing it over to them

00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:19.119
Caption: and lastly one of the best things i find

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:21.359
Caption: where you can really change people&#39;s

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:23.199
Caption: lives is acknowledgement

00:18:21.359 --> 00:18:24.719
Caption: now this can take the form of a simple

00:18:23.199 --> 00:18:27.038
Caption: sentence when you&#39;re thanking them for

00:18:24.719 --> 00:18:29.678
Caption: their work or more public forms of

00:18:27.038 --> 00:18:32.879
Caption: recognition like shout outs at a team

00:18:29.678 --> 00:18:34.640
Caption: meeting or your chat channels

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.520
Caption: acknowledgement can be related to the

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.479
Caption: work

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.160
Caption: or their ability or their attitude or

00:18:38.479 --> 00:18:41.599
Caption: the impact that they&#39;ve had

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.679
Caption: and this goes a long way to telling

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:46.319
Caption: people that you see their effort or

00:18:43.678 --> 00:18:48.798
Caption: their value and you appreciate it they

00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:50.159
Caption: are appreciated

00:18:48.798 --> 00:18:52.558
Caption: and there&#39;s something beautiful to see

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.559
Caption: in the fact that human beings or pixel

00:18:52.558 --> 00:18:56.159
Caption: art characters can and do go out of

00:18:54.558 --> 00:18:58.319
Caption: their way to improve the lives of others

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.919
Caption: and not for any reward

00:18:58.319 --> 00:19:01.678
Caption: so always remember

00:18:59.918 --> 00:19:03.279
Caption: there&#39;s so much more to the people

00:19:01.678 --> 00:19:04.719
Caption: around you than the work that you&#39;re

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.960
Caption: doing together

00:19:04.719 --> 00:19:10.678
Caption: because people change you every day and

00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:10.678
Caption: you change them too

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:16.079
Caption: so a game is often comprised of multiple

00:19:13.918 --> 00:19:18.239
Caption: levels you can picture these like the

00:19:16.079 --> 00:19:20.399
Caption: various companies you&#39;ve worked at

00:19:18.239 --> 00:19:22.640
Caption: the various roles you&#39;ve had projects

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.359
Caption: you&#39;ve worked on or challenges that you

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.119
Caption: might not have encountered before

00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:28.558
Caption: and just like in a game often these

00:19:27.119 --> 00:19:30.558
Caption: levels will become harder as you

00:19:28.558 --> 00:19:32.239
Caption: progress through your journey so it can

00:19:30.558 --> 00:19:34.479
Caption: become hard to realize just how far

00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.479
Caption: you&#39;ve actually come

00:19:34.479 --> 00:19:38.959
Caption: here&#39;s us at our first level slaying

00:19:36.479 --> 00:19:40.160
Caption: tiny dragons and yes that dragon has a

00:19:38.959 --> 00:19:42.079
Caption: nappy

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.760
Caption: um we start off pretty weak because

00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:46.159
Caption: we&#39;re pretty new to this so we still

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.599
Caption: find it a bit challenging and confusing

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.200
Caption: this is pretty much the equivalent of

00:19:47.599 --> 00:19:52.239
Caption: learning hello world when you don&#39;t know

00:19:49.199 --> 00:19:54.079
Caption: a single thing about programming

00:19:52.239 --> 00:19:55.678
Caption: and as we get further through the levels

00:19:54.079 --> 00:19:57.760
Caption: now we&#39;re stronger than we were before

00:19:55.678 --> 00:19:59.439
Caption: when we started but the dragons have

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.119
Caption: actually gotten bigger too they still

00:19:59.439 --> 00:20:02.879
Caption: feel difficult to us

00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:04.400
Caption: this trend continues all the way up

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.079
Caption: through your journey

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.159
Caption: every time you get stronger and progress

00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:09.918
Caption: through the levels dragons get bigger so

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:11.039
Caption: it feels just as difficult as when you

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:13.439
Caption: start it off

00:20:11.038 --> 00:20:15.359
Caption: and the same goes for your career

00:20:13.439 --> 00:20:17.359
Caption: but it makes it hard to realize just how

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:19.599
Caption: far you&#39;ve come when you all you know is

00:20:17.359 --> 00:20:21.038
Caption: that the work still feels hard

00:20:19.599 --> 00:20:22.798
Caption: your work might be difficult for you

00:20:21.038 --> 00:20:24.798
Caption: every single day and

00:20:22.798 --> 00:20:27.038
Caption: especially if you work in software

00:20:24.798 --> 00:20:28.479
Caption: development or technology not only is

00:20:27.038 --> 00:20:29.918
Caption: the work changing every day but the

00:20:28.479 --> 00:20:31.439
Caption: problems are difficult they&#39;re not

00:20:29.918 --> 00:20:33.439
Caption: routine

00:20:31.439 --> 00:20:35.199
Caption: but the dragons must get bigger for you

00:20:33.439 --> 00:20:37.199
Caption: to get stronger

00:20:35.199 --> 00:20:38.880
Caption: if you consider if you continually gave

00:20:37.199 --> 00:20:41.119
Caption: one plus one equations to high school

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.199
Caption: students they wouldn&#39;t grow

00:20:41.119 --> 00:20:45.359
Caption: the problems need to get bigger with

00:20:43.199 --> 00:20:47.678
Caption: their skills

00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:49.520
Caption: so how can we then appreciate appreciate

00:20:47.678 --> 00:20:51.439
Caption: how far we&#39;ve actually come and what

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.359
Caption: we&#39;ve accomplished

00:20:51.439 --> 00:20:54.959
Caption: one of the most satisfying ways i found

00:20:53.359 --> 00:20:57.199
Caption: was to look back on old projects that

00:20:54.959 --> 00:20:59.038
Caption: i&#39;d worked on and delivered even things

00:20:57.199 --> 00:21:01.599
Caption: i made in university

00:20:59.038 --> 00:21:03.599
Caption: look at the deliverables themselves your

00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:05.119
Caption: notebooks your code

00:21:03.599 --> 00:21:06.959
Caption: and you might notice that these old

00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:09.520
Caption: projects might look amateurish to you

00:21:06.959 --> 00:21:11.839
Caption: now you could do them much better and we

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.320
Caption: all know the good old who wrote this oh

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:15.760
Caption: it was me six months ago

00:21:14.319 --> 00:21:17.439
Caption: sometimes you&#39;ll actually look back on

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.959
Caption: old projects and still be proud of them

00:21:17.439 --> 00:21:20.719
Caption: because you still think they were good

00:21:18.959 --> 00:21:22.798
Caption: work

00:21:20.719 --> 00:21:25.119
Caption: and another method is to keep a log of

00:21:22.798 --> 00:21:27.839
Caption: all the things you&#39;ve learned this month

00:21:25.119 --> 00:21:31.678
Caption: or this year that you couldn&#39;t do before

00:21:27.839 --> 00:21:33.839
Caption: and you can now comfortably do

00:21:31.678 --> 00:21:35.599
Caption: and for all of these levels remember the

00:21:33.839 --> 00:21:37.038
Caption: challenges that you overcame and what

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:39.199
Caption: you gained

00:21:37.038 --> 00:21:41.678
Caption: was a brand new type of problem which

00:21:39.199 --> 00:21:43.839
Caption: you had to be creative with

00:21:41.678 --> 00:21:46.959
Caption: did you deal with difficult customers

00:21:43.839 --> 00:21:49.599
Caption: and needed to practice patience

00:21:46.959 --> 00:21:51.439
Caption: did you gain determination points for

00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:52.959
Caption: pushing through even though it didn&#39;t

00:21:51.439 --> 00:21:55.199
Caption: get any easier either because you knew

00:21:52.959 --> 00:21:58.000
Caption: you had to or because you thought it was

00:21:55.199 --> 00:21:59.519
Caption: worth the effort and the difficulty

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.199
Caption: or was the level testing your

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.959
Caption: self-respect points

00:22:01.199 --> 00:22:05.519
Caption: having to say no to unreasonable

00:22:02.959 --> 00:22:07.038
Caption: requests having difficult conversations

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.039
Caption: or even just knowing when it was right

00:22:07.038 --> 00:22:10.558
Caption: to quit

00:22:09.038 --> 00:22:12.158
Caption: sometimes you&#39;ll learn that these levels

00:22:10.558 --> 00:22:14.158
Caption: were actually less about the enemies to

00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:16.640
Caption: defeat and more about how you use

00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:18.640
Caption: teamwork to beat them

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.159
Caption: when i was preparing this presentation i

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.919
Caption: was struggling to put my thoughts into

00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:24.640
Caption: meaningful words and i was stubborn

00:22:21.918 --> 00:22:26.399
Caption: about getting help for a good few days

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.239
Caption: when i started getting people&#39;s feedback

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.000
Caption: not only were they very very useful to

00:22:28.239 --> 00:22:32.000
Caption: me but they also made me feel less

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.880
Caption: pressure because i felt supported and

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.880
Caption: people had my back

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.400
Caption: maybe you&#39;ve had a project that got you

00:22:36.959 --> 00:22:40.479
Caption: all excited with the tasks and you

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.640
Caption: charged full steam ahead without ever

00:22:40.479 --> 00:22:44.558
Caption: getting the end users feedback only to

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.159
Caption: discover at the end that it wasn&#39;t what

00:22:44.558 --> 00:22:48.079
Caption: they wanted or you didn&#39;t really have

00:22:46.159 --> 00:22:50.559
Caption: their buy-in this teaches you the

00:22:48.079 --> 00:22:52.399
Caption: importance of keeping people involved

00:22:50.558 --> 00:22:54.000
Caption: understanding the main goal and also

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.280
Caption: understanding what different people&#39;s

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.880
Caption: perspectives are

00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.479
Caption: are you really helping them

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.159
Caption: do you really understand what they need

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:03.280
Caption: and these are not questions exclusive to

00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:05.600
Caption: work

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.440
Caption: they apply to many things in our society

00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:11.199
Caption: and our values and our relationships

00:23:09.439 --> 00:23:13.599
Caption: how we respond to challenges that we

00:23:11.199 --> 00:23:16.000
Caption: face and what we learn from the end at

00:23:13.599 --> 00:23:17.918
Caption: the end in reflection can sometimes be

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.918
Caption: far greater than the prize we get at the

00:23:17.918 --> 00:23:22.158
Caption: end of their level or what we manage to

00:23:19.918 --> 00:23:24.319
Caption: achieve

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:26.159
Caption: now i want to emphasize here there are

00:23:24.319 --> 00:23:28.479
Caption: different ways that you can play a game

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:30.720
Caption: and progress through the levels

00:23:28.479 --> 00:23:33.119
Caption: so some players will pick a randomized

00:23:30.719 --> 00:23:35.520
Caption: character go through the levels really

00:23:33.119 --> 00:23:38.000
Caption: quickly and beat the main storyline

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.000
Caption: within a day

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.159
Caption: some players are thorough and they have

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.400
Caption: to complete every single side quest

00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:46.880
Caption: available heck some players even watch

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.839
Caption: the full cut scenes without skipping

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:52.400
Caption: for me i play games a little differently

00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:53.839
Caption: i enjoy games with good mood story and

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.559
Caption: aesthetics

00:23:53.839 --> 00:23:58.798
Caption: i take my time which is hours actually

00:23:56.558 --> 00:24:00.959
Caption: to create my character and customize

00:23:58.798 --> 00:24:02.719
Caption: every hair on their beard

00:24:00.959 --> 00:24:04.798
Caption: choose a nice armor set that compliments

00:24:02.719 --> 00:24:06.400
Caption: my sword exploring the maps taking

00:24:04.798 --> 00:24:08.399
Caption: screenshots and building up my

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:10.719
Caption: environment as if i live in it

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.960
Caption: i am not one of those fast players

00:24:10.719 --> 00:24:14.558
Caption: i take my time

00:24:12.959 --> 00:24:16.719
Caption: and so there are many different ways

00:24:14.558 --> 00:24:19.199
Caption: that people enjoy their game and the

00:24:16.719 --> 00:24:21.359
Caption: same goes for your career

00:24:19.199 --> 00:24:22.798
Caption: how you choose to play your career out

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:25.038
Caption: can be totally different to someone

00:24:22.798 --> 00:24:26.319
Caption: else&#39;s

00:24:25.038 --> 00:24:28.879
Caption: there are different ways to play the

00:24:26.319 --> 00:24:33.399
Caption: game and each way can be just as

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.400
Caption: valuable and enjoyable as another

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.200
Caption: so at the end of your career journey

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:38.880
Caption: you&#39;ll hopefully come out with the

00:24:37.199 --> 00:24:41.760
Caption: following things

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.599
Caption: so loot or money

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.558
Caption: a number of dragons slayed which is your

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:49.439
Caption: projects and your accomplishments

00:24:46.558 --> 00:24:51.839
Caption: higher status in the world

00:24:49.439 --> 00:24:54.000
Caption: and new skills

00:24:51.839 --> 00:24:57.278
Caption: but it&#39;s important to once again reflect

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.798
Caption: on something that we often forget

00:24:57.279 --> 00:25:00.960
Caption: you

00:24:58.798 --> 00:25:02.079
Caption: what did your career give to you as a

00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:04.319
Caption: person

00:25:02.079 --> 00:25:07.038
Caption: and what did you give to your career

00:25:04.319 --> 00:25:08.798
Caption: beyond magic spells and your code and

00:25:07.038 --> 00:25:10.239
Caption: your deliverables

00:25:08.798 --> 00:25:13.519
Caption: how have you affected the lives of

00:25:10.239 --> 00:25:15.760
Caption: others around you on a personal level

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.760
Caption: and i lie a bit here this actually isn&#39;t

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.558
Caption: the end this is something that you can

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.640
Caption: reflect on throughout your whole career

00:25:20.558 --> 00:25:24.158
Caption: because careers can end and start anew

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.919
Caption: and when one journey ends another can

00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:27.440
Caption: start so that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to

00:25:25.918 --> 00:25:29.038
Caption: get something out of it that will carry

00:25:27.439 --> 00:25:30.959
Caption: on

00:25:29.038 --> 00:25:32.319
Caption: it&#39;s important to reflect on you every

00:25:30.959 --> 00:25:34.399
Caption: now and then because that&#39;s something

00:25:32.319 --> 00:25:36.319
Caption: that almost more than these other things

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.880
Caption: mentioned you can apply to your personal

00:25:36.319 --> 00:25:41.199
Caption: life outside your career

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.039
Caption: you use your stats with confidence in

00:25:41.199 --> 00:25:45.519
Caption: your relationships

00:25:43.038 --> 00:25:47.678
Caption: use your stats in problem solving when

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.599
Caption: your car breaks down

00:25:47.678 --> 00:25:51.599
Caption: use your stats in communication when you

00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:53.119
Caption: teach your kids

00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:55.359
Caption: and the way that you treat others in the

00:25:53.119 --> 00:25:58.558
Caption: workplace has an effect on who they

00:25:55.359 --> 00:26:00.640
Caption: become as people too

00:25:58.558 --> 00:26:02.959
Caption: you learn to appreciate differences in

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.359
Caption: people that you work with and start to

00:26:02.959 --> 00:26:07.439

00:26:05.359 --> 00:26:09.359
Caption: everyday life

00:26:07.439 --> 00:26:11.759
