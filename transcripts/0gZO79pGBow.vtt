Caption: Aaron who&#39;s going to be talking about

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.859
Caption: unleashing the power of Visual Studio

00:00:16.378 --> 00:00:22.379
Caption: code probably one of the more industry

00:00:19.858 --> 00:00:24.599
Caption: changing editors of recent times I would

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:28.219
Caption: say so please everyone put your hands

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.220

Caption: for Microsoft as part of the cloud

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:41.279
Caption: advocacy team I&#39;ve been doing software

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.959
Caption: development and web development for

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:44.398
Caption: longer that I&#39;m going to admit to or

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:48.479
Caption: that in a session that&#39;s being recorded

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:50.819
Caption: and streamed out but I I I&#39;ve used a lot

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:53.279
Caption: of editors in my time like I I got

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:56.279
Caption: started with like pico and

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:58.319
Caption: um and stuff like that emacs on on Linux

00:00:56.279 --> 00:01:01.259
Caption: machines when I was uh

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:03.659
Caption: first at Uni and then obviously have

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:07.139
Caption: graduated to more complex editors but

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:10.139
Caption: yeah like vs code is it&#39;s been huge like

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:12.658
Caption: in like the way that has changed how

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:13.739
Caption: people think about you know Simple Text

00:01:12.658 --> 00:01:15.839
Caption: editors because at the end of the day

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:17.938
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s what it is and the fact

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:19.798
Caption: that I&#39;m I&#39;m here and you&#39;re stuck in a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.799
Caption: room with me for the next 45 minutes to

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.259
Caption: hear me talk about a text editor I think

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.020
Caption: that&#39;s kind of a kind of a big deal out

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.700
Caption: but yeah if you if you want to uh get in

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:30.719
Caption: contact with you after the session ask

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:33.839
Caption: me any questions that I don&#39;t get a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.000
Caption: chance to cover off during uh during the

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:37.798
Caption: talk uh that&#39;s my social media and uh

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.639
Caption: website and email address and all that

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.979
Caption: kind of stuff

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:42.298
Caption: but um before we jump into the talk I

Caption: want to thank the sponsors

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.040
Caption: um I&#39;ve been doing DDD conferences in

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.019
Caption: Australia for 12 years now and they

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.700
Caption: can&#39;t happen without sponsors um like

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:52.078
Caption: all the ones we&#39;ve got here particularly

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:53.158
Caption: Microsoft they&#39;re an awesome sponsor you

Caption: but

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.099
Caption: we&#39;re here to to talk about the power of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.799
Caption: vs code

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.720
Caption: um no so whether whether you&#39;re brand

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.400
Caption: new to the tech industry you&#39;re looking

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.160
Caption: to get into Tech

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:16.979
Caption: um or you&#39;ve been in it for you know the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.360
Caption: nearly 20 years that I&#39;ve been in it

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.399
Caption: um yeah I hope that there&#39;s going to be

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.619
Caption: something in this session for you

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:26.458
Caption: um I I&#39;ve put this together because I

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:28.259
Caption: I&#39;m I think that it&#39;s while it seems so

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:30.000
Caption: simple it&#39;s a text editor there&#39;s so

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:33.179
Caption: many hidden things in it

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.559
Caption: um but to get started I&#39;m going to just

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.659
Caption: make sure that you know for those of you

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.679
Caption: that haven&#39;t used vs code before or you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.120
Caption: haven&#39;t had

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.799
Caption: um I had much experience with it let&#39;s

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:42.839
Caption: just make sure that we&#39;re all on the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.040
Caption: same page so we&#39;re gonna do a quick lap

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:49.199
Caption: around vs code so this is uh vs code um

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:50.579
Caption: I&#39;ve got a project of mine open there um

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.139
Caption: don&#39;t try and read the text it&#39;s not

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.458
Caption: particularly interesting or relevant um

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.378
Caption: but what I&#39;m going to do is I want to

00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:57.300
Caption: break down the core features of the text

00:02:55.378 --> 00:03:00.059
Caption: editor

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.919
Caption: across the top we have the the title bar

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.720
Caption: and that&#39;s where you your menu systems

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.699
Caption: are and like every application Under the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.259
Caption: Sun has got a title bar of someone&#39;s

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:09.839
Caption: description but the interesting thing

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:11.220
Caption: about the vs code one is that it&#39;s

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.899
Caption: highly customizable in fact like

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.819
Caption: everything in vs code is highly

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:17.158
Caption: customizable so at the top it&#39;s got

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.598
Caption: things like the the file name um of the

00:03:17.158 --> 00:03:21.598
Caption: file that we&#39;re currently got open it&#39;s

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:24.720
Caption: got the the information about the uh the

00:03:21.598 --> 00:03:26.639
Caption: repo this is connected to I&#39;m connected

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.080
Caption: to a remote vs code instance so I&#39;m

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.458
Caption: using it with WSL so it&#39;s got that

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.378
Caption: information in there but you can

00:03:29.458 --> 00:03:32.819
Caption: actually edit that and change you know

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:34.080
Caption: strip out information you don&#39;t think is

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.000
Caption: going to be needed or you don&#39;t want to

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.220
Caption: display in there and this can be really

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.458
Caption: really useful some someone that has

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.619
Caption: maybe some attention uh issues and some

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:45.298
Caption: some newer diversion in that regardless

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.919
Caption: I can strip out the stuff that isn&#39;t

00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:48.238
Caption: like I don&#39;t need to have it there I

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.158
Caption: don&#39;t need it to tell me I&#39;m in vs code

00:03:48.238 --> 00:03:51.779
Caption: because I know I&#39;m in vs code um for

00:03:50.158 --> 00:03:55.319
Caption: example like you can you can modify it

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:57.598
Caption: to be the editor that you need it to be

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.399
Caption: we have the sidebar um on the left-hand

00:03:57.598 --> 00:04:01.139
Caption: side um I actually hit mine on the right

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:03.419
Caption: hand side and you know I&#39;ll I&#39;ll show

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.518
Caption: you uh why when I jump into actually

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.839
Caption: editor but this is where we have like

00:04:05.518 --> 00:04:08.279
Caption: our files and our folder structure

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:10.080
Caption: that&#39;s all there it&#39;s where we get to

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:12.779
Caption: the debugger we get to Source control so

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.339
Caption: we can um like make our commits into the

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:16.019
Caption: git repo or

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:20.100
Caption: um is there any other source control

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:24.240
Caption: that people still use like it&#39;s like SVN

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.899
Caption: oh now now am I really dating myself CVS

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:29.699
Caption: anyone anyone serious yeah yeah

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:31.739
Caption: um but so the other thing with the

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.899
Caption: sidebar is that uh extensions that you

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:35.399
Caption: can add to vs code can also introduce

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:37.079
Caption: things in here so I&#39;ve got a couple

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:38.639
Caption: additional icons down the bottom there

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:41.279
Caption: the Azure extension a Docker extension

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.960
Caption: and a few things like that so that that

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:45.419
Caption: um there&#39;s functionality specific to

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:47.100
Caption: that I don&#39;t know a complex extension

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.899
Caption: like the Azure one that allows you work

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.160
Caption: with Azure resources you know it&#39;s all

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:51.899
Caption: there and I can do it with inside of the

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.259
Caption: editor so the editor goes beyond just

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:57.899
Caption: being a um a text editing place it&#39;s

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.399
Caption: also a more complex tool there are seats

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:00.479
Caption: up the front feel like you don&#39;t feel

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:02.779
Caption: like you need to awkwardly stand around

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.779
Caption: the back

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:07.258
Caption: down the bottom we have our status bar

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:09.600
Caption: and this is again showing just a whole

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.720
Caption: bunch of uh like little quick quick

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.759
Caption: pieces of information things like what

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.199
Caption: branch are we on in the the git repo

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.600
Caption: that we&#39;ve got open now are there any

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.100
Caption: errors or warnings in the project that

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.440
Caption: I&#39;ve got open

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.839
Caption: um what&#39;s the what&#39;s the lining Coatings

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.899
Caption: because that&#39;s a painful thing there are

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:29.039
Caption: still seats please do come in don&#39;t you

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:30.899
Caption: don&#39;t feel like you need to stand in the

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.660
Caption: doorway

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:35.220
Caption: um and like what what uh language

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.380
Caption: Services being used so this is It&#39;s a

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.940
Caption: HTML file that&#39;s got open HTML but I can

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.380
Caption: change that to you know what and that

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.380
Caption: indicates then and that can be useful if

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.500
Caption: uh you know you&#39;ve uh working with you

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.959
Caption: know multiple languages that uh maybe uh

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.940
Caption: more esoteric than uh and kind of just

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:52.559
Caption: you common run in the middle sort of

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.360
Caption: stuff but again you can turn as much of

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:55.979
Caption: this stuff off as you want because again

00:05:54.359 --> 00:05:57.478
Caption: you might not want that information you

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.539
Caption: might not need it there because you know

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:02.100
Caption: it&#39;s contextually irrelevant to you or

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.079
Caption: um you find it distracting to have that

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.539
Caption: kind of stuff all there

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:07.439
Caption: uh then we&#39;ve got our terminal across

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.940
Caption: the bottom so there&#39;s an integrated

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.739
Caption: terminal in vs code

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.940
Caption: um uh that we can we can open up but we

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:13.979
Caption: can open up as many terminal Windows as

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.660
Caption: we can um when I&#39;m working I tend to

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.800
Caption: have just vs code open and I don&#39;t even

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.600
Caption: have a separate terminal app running

00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:20.759
Caption: anymore I just pop the terminal up um

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.679
Caption: run my npm commands or run my git

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.819
Caption: installs oh sorry get my GIF commands

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:26.160
Caption: and stuff like that

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:28.619
Caption: um all within here also interestingly um

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.220
Caption: if you do run like a node uh command so

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:34.259
Caption: like in a npm start to how to run a web

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.759
Caption: server from the VSCO terminal it will

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.319
Caption: automatically attach a debugger for you

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.419
Caption: you don&#39;t even have to like do anything

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.479
Caption: extra to get debugging running for like

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:45.899
Caption: a node application yeah npm start as

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:47.160
Caption: your debugger already ready to go

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:50.399
Caption: um and then there&#39;s actually a text

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.080
Caption: editing surface as well like it&#39;s been

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:53.639
Caption: like five minutes and I haven&#39;t talked

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:56.638
Caption: about the fact that you could edit a

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.259
Caption: text document in a text editor

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:01.319
Caption: but I mean you can it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.459
Caption: obviously the core feature um no it does

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:05.100
Caption: all the things you&#39;d expect from a text

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:06.899
Caption: that ever does syntax highlighting um I

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.399
Caption: have like errors and stuff like that

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:10.079
Caption: will appear if the language service that

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:11.339
Caption: you&#39;re using is um is servicing that

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:13.739
Caption: information up

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:15.660
Caption: um and this is a HTML file it&#39;s you know

00:07:13.739 --> 00:07:17.039
Caption: if it&#39;s got a variety of colors in there

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.000
Caption: to indicate the different things inside

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:20.220
Caption: of that

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.019
Caption: and lastly we have our mini map view of

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.699
Caption: the file so there&#39;s like a 10 000 view

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:25.198
Caption: of the file that you&#39;re in

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.459
Caption: um and this is not a particularly long

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:27.720
Caption: file so it&#39;s all condensed at the top

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:30.239
Caption: and you can see even like the the

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.380
Caption: colorization appears there um but this

00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:34.679
Caption: can be useful if you&#39;re scrolling

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.419
Caption: through a thousand long thousands of

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:38.459
Caption: like a file that&#39;s like a thousand miles

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:41.039
Caption: long not that anyone&#39;s writing like

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:43.079
Caption: single files that are like like several

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:44.160
Caption: thousands Lines no no one does that do

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:46.500
Caption: they

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.559
Caption: I see some I see some awkward uh awkward

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:52.380
Caption: nodding of the head there

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:54.299
Caption: um all right so that&#39;s vs code in a very

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.160
Caption: quick nutshell uh and you know kind of

00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:57.899
Caption: like all like all the different aspects

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.959
Caption: of vs code and the things that are in

00:07:57.899 --> 00:08:02.759
Caption: there so let&#39;s now

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:04.380
Caption: talk about all right how can we use it

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:07.619
Caption: to be productive and and for me being

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:10.619
Caption: productive means keyboard like I&#39;m I&#39;m a

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:12.239
Caption: keyboard um user I I don&#39;t have an

00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:13.739
Caption: external Mouse like when I&#39;m when I&#39;m

00:08:12.239 --> 00:08:15.119
Caption: using my laptop I don&#39;t use an external

00:08:13.739 --> 00:08:17.459
Caption: Mouse I can use an external Mouse at

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:19.378
Caption: home because I have a desktop but I so

00:08:17.459 --> 00:08:21.479
Caption: I&#39;ve done everything I can to try and

00:08:19.378 --> 00:08:24.179
Caption: memorize as many keyboard shortcuts as I

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:25.559
Caption: can I know a scary amount of word

00:08:24.179 --> 00:08:28.378
Caption: shortcuts

00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:29.699
Caption: so like I can power using my way through

00:08:28.378 --> 00:08:32.338
Caption: Microsoft Word

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:34.080
Caption: um but also in vs code

00:08:32.338 --> 00:08:35.820
Caption: um and

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.898
Caption: let&#39;s jump over

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.338
Caption: there&#39;s enough slides at the moment

00:08:36.898 --> 00:08:40.619
Caption: let&#39;s jump over and actually have a look

00:08:38.338 --> 00:08:43.200
Caption: at BS code and some stuff that we&#39;ve got

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:45.119
Caption: in here so I&#39;ve got a couple of

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.720
Caption: different vs coded this is open

00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:47.338
Caption: um

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:49.319
Caption: the the you should be able to read the

00:08:47.338 --> 00:08:51.119
Caption: text but again don&#39;t worry about the

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.500
Caption: text in there this is mostly my notes so

00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:55.619
Caption: feel free to read ahead and just then

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.659
Caption: zone out to me because this is what I&#39;m

00:08:55.619 --> 00:09:01.440
Caption: going to be covering but

00:08:57.659 --> 00:09:04.799
Caption: if there is only one shortcut key in vs

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.299
Caption: code that you learn it is control p

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:08.580
Caption: this brings up

00:09:06.299 --> 00:09:11.278
Caption: um the defaults to the file picker so I

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.600
Caption: can use this to find the readme file hit

00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:15.838
Caption: enter and opens the file I&#39;m currently

00:09:12.599 --> 00:09:17.759
Caption: in but we can also use uh this to say

00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:19.739
Caption: type a question mark and here are all

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.500
Caption: the other things that we can get from

00:09:19.739 --> 00:09:24.719
Caption: this um the it moves on from being just

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.239
Caption: a file a file picker to being a command

00:09:24.719 --> 00:09:28.679
Caption: palette so I could do a greater than

00:09:27.239 --> 00:09:30.778
Caption: symbol and then these are all the things

00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:34.320
Caption: like the actions I can perform within uh

00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:38.640
Caption: vs code I can open the settings or I can

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.018
Caption: go to uh like uh so I&#39;ve actually

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.700
Caption: traveled on a thing called screencast

00:09:40.018 --> 00:09:43.919
Caption: mode uh so as I type the keyboard

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.660
Caption: shortcuts uh they&#39;ll pop up quickly on

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:47.039
Caption: the screen so you know I&#39;m like here&#39;s

00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:49.859
Caption: the keyboard shortcut and you&#39;re like I

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:51.778
Caption: can&#39;t see the keyboard Aaron you&#39;re up

00:09:49.859 --> 00:09:53.579
Caption: there and there&#39;s a screen

00:09:51.778 --> 00:09:56.518
Caption: um so I&#39;ve got that turned on so you can

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.799
Caption: see uh so control P comes with the file

00:09:56.518 --> 00:10:01.380
Caption: picker control shift p

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:03.778
Caption: if I hit the correct Keys um go straight

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.518
Caption: to the actions so uh this is just a

00:10:03.778 --> 00:10:07.200
Caption: because it&#39;s a quick one because this is

00:10:05.518 --> 00:10:09.059
Caption: probably the most common thing that you

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.338
Caption: tend to do from the file picker uh so

00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:12.719
Caption: from from the the command palette

00:10:11.338 --> 00:10:14.940
Caption: um other things I like like if I type

00:10:12.719 --> 00:10:16.739
Caption: view I can get to the slide bar

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.179
Caption: um on the right hand side there cool

00:10:16.739 --> 00:10:19.559
Caption: it&#39;s a false to the left-hand side I

00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:22.919
Caption: move it to the right hand side because

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:25.018
Caption: if I expand it and collapse it

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:26.760
Caption: pops in and out if I have it on the left

00:10:25.018 --> 00:10:28.739
Caption: let&#39;s see if I can remember how to move

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.820
Caption: it to the left

00:10:28.739 --> 00:10:31.320
Caption: I actually can&#39;t remember how to move it

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.119
Caption: to the left it&#39;s somewhere in settings

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.580
Caption: it&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve done that

00:10:33.119 --> 00:10:38.338
Caption: oh was it

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.739
Caption: ah excellent there we go

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:42.599
Caption: um control B hides and shows it but this

00:10:40.739 --> 00:10:46.078
Caption: is really annoying for me because you

00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:48.059
Caption: now your focal point is um is Shifting

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:51.958
Caption: because the the editor surface is moving

00:10:48.059 --> 00:10:54.719
Caption: so that&#39;s why I move mine to the right

00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:57.239
Caption: um anyway so control P View and then I

00:10:54.719 --> 00:11:00.958
Caption: can go to explore pop up into this bit

00:10:57.239 --> 00:11:03.599
Caption: or control B P view uh debug

00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.979
Caption: and get to the debug section okay

00:11:03.599 --> 00:11:07.139
Caption: um so I don&#39;t have to maybe like

00:11:04.979 --> 00:11:08.699
Caption: memorize um the shortcut keys I think

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.739
Caption: that&#39;s wow

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.458
Caption: F5 I think might get you to that I

00:11:10.739 --> 00:11:13.919
Caption: forget

00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:17.278
Caption: um but I just do control P view

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:20.039
Caption: um but also then I can say in Explorer

00:11:17.278 --> 00:11:22.679
Caption: if I was in Explorer I can then go to

00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:25.018
Caption: like the uh the folders or the outline

00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:27.719
Caption: view or um you know so I can actually

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:29.820
Caption: navigate the sub menus within or the sub

00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:32.338
Caption: sections with inside of

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.260
Caption: um the the sidebar um using the command

00:11:32.338 --> 00:11:35.640
Caption: palette again just all off the off the

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.518
Caption: keyboard there

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.739
Caption: another one um term for uh quick access

00:11:38.518 --> 00:11:42.299
Caption: to anything to do with thermals and

00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:43.799
Caption: create a new terminal

00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:45.419
Caption: that one&#39;s going to be down there and a

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:46.679
Caption: term

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:49.260
Caption: whoops

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:51.359
Caption: turn and then I can create

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:54.299
Caption: another terminal

00:11:51.359 --> 00:11:56.760
Caption: and then I can swap between them

00:11:54.299 --> 00:11:58.320
Caption: um but we tell them they&#39;re all called

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.059
Caption: zsh because that&#39;s the shell that I&#39;m

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.679
Caption: using in this case uh but it was like

00:12:00.059 --> 00:12:04.440
Caption: well which one which ones which how do I

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:05.940
Caption: easily know that well Ctrl shift p

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:08.159
Caption: command palette and then we&#39;re going to

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.419
Caption: go terminal rename and we&#39;ll call this

00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:10.619
Caption: one we&#39;ll call this git because I&#39;m

00:12:09.419 --> 00:12:13.679
Caption: going to use that for my git operations

00:12:10.619 --> 00:12:16.078
Caption: and now if I go control P term I can

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:17.760
Caption: type git and jump to that particular

00:12:16.078 --> 00:12:19.139
Caption: terminal so this is usually if you&#39;ve

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.700
Caption: got a couple opens maybe you&#39;re maybe

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.200
Caption: you&#39;re building an application has got a

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.338
Caption: like a front end and a back end and if

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.260
Caption: you&#39;ve got a couple of terminals open

00:12:23.338 --> 00:12:26.880
Caption: ones running the back end um like the

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.919
Caption: npm command to run the back end the

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.500
Caption: others uh the the front end web

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:32.518
Caption: application so you&#39;ve got multiple

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.440
Caption: terminals running node processors well

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:36.059
Caption: you could rename them so that you can

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.338
Caption: jump back and forth and you can see the

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:41.820
Caption: uh which one like the log messages from

00:12:38.338 --> 00:12:43.260
Caption: the right one um easily from there

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.979
Caption: all right

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.979
Caption: um so

00:12:46.619 --> 00:12:51.539
Caption: yeah Ctrl P probably like the number one

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:53.898
Caption: shortcut to take away and to remember uh

00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:53.898
Caption: from this

00:12:54.599 --> 00:12:58.559
Caption: now I&#39;m talking about screencast mode

00:12:57.059 --> 00:13:00.359
Caption: which I&#39;ve got turned on and we can get

00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:02.700
Caption: to that from settings control comma

00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:04.679
Caption: we&#39;ll get to settings we type screen

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.260
Caption: cast

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:09.359
Caption: and I have that done here um you can

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.398
Caption: actually let me hide terminals uh

00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:13.739
Caption: control backtick will collapse the

00:13:11.398 --> 00:13:16.440
Caption: terminals um error at the bottom hide

00:13:13.739 --> 00:13:19.200
Caption: and show short back tick and how&#39;s that

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.419
Caption: control B to collapse that um so with uh

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.338
Caption: with screencast mode Um this can be good

00:13:21.419 --> 00:13:24.599
Caption: for pair programming as well uh so

00:13:23.338 --> 00:13:25.679
Caption: you&#39;re uh whether you&#39;re doing it like

00:13:24.599 --> 00:13:27.599
Caption: as a

00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:29.099
Caption: um like a remote peer programming

00:13:27.599 --> 00:13:30.179
Caption: session or you&#39;ve just got someone um

00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:31.078
Caption: that&#39;s sitting next to you and you know

00:13:30.179 --> 00:13:32.278
Caption: you don&#39;t want them kind of breathing

00:13:31.078 --> 00:13:33.599
Caption: down your neck trying to work out well

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:35.458
Caption: they see what you&#39;re doing

00:13:33.599 --> 00:13:37.739
Caption: um and just total it on can be a useful

00:13:35.458 --> 00:13:40.500
Caption: thing but you can it can be a little bit

00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:42.179
Caption: annoying because like every key stroke

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.219
Caption: is getting captured in here but I can

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:45.898
Caption: change that and say that I only want it

00:13:44.219 --> 00:13:47.219
Caption: to show you just like the commands so if

00:13:45.898 --> 00:13:48.778
Caption: I&#39;m using the command or I&#39;ll sort of

00:13:47.219 --> 00:13:49.619
Caption: those kind of keys it&#39;ll just show those

00:13:48.778 --> 00:13:51.059
Caption: up

00:13:49.619 --> 00:13:52.440
Caption: um and that could be a bit more useful I

00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:53.458
Caption: guess if you&#39;re doing demos and stuff

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.739
Caption: like that

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:58.700
Caption: um change font size change uh styling

00:13:55.739 --> 00:13:58.700
Caption: all that kind of stuff there

00:13:59.398 --> 00:14:06.419
Caption: um another useful uh mode of uh this

00:14:03.119 --> 00:14:09.119
Caption: code is Zen mode control K Zed

00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:10.500
Caption: now you just you you want to kind of

00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:11.700
Caption: turn off as many of the distractions as

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.898
Caption: you&#39;ve got because you you&#39;re like

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.940
Caption: you&#39;re you&#39;re in you&#39;re in the moment

00:14:12.898 --> 00:14:16.260
Caption: like you&#39;re trying to you know get

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.398
Caption: through a bug or whatever the case may

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.500
Caption: be

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:20.458
Caption: um this as you can see it&#39;s hidden

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.440
Caption: pretty much everything we&#39;ve hidden the

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:25.018
Caption: sidebar we&#39;ve hit the status bar

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.458
Caption: um the the top menus um hidden like we

00:14:25.018 --> 00:14:27.719
Caption: don&#39;t even have the you can&#39;t even see

00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:28.919
Caption: the different files we&#39;ve got open I

00:14:27.719 --> 00:14:30.958
Caption: only have one file open at the moment

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:32.820
Caption: anyway but like you would you could

00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:34.799
Caption: control tab to get between the the files

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.299
Caption: but yeah this is like you know it&#39;s a

00:14:34.799 --> 00:14:38.278
Caption: it&#39;s a focus mode like we&#39;ve hidden

00:14:36.299 --> 00:14:40.078
Caption: everything that could be a potential

00:14:38.278 --> 00:14:42.299
Caption: distraction just so we can focus on the

00:14:40.078 --> 00:14:44.880
Caption: thing that we&#39;re currently trying to do

00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:47.278
Caption: uh control KZ to get back out of that

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.320
Caption: there are a bunch of settings for Zen

00:14:47.278 --> 00:14:50.278
Caption: mode as well so let&#39;s say that it&#39;s

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.559
Caption: actually maybe a little bit too

00:14:50.278 --> 00:14:55.559
Caption: aggressive I do still want to have uh

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:57.479
Caption: line numbers in here I can say that well

00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:59.398
Caption: no don&#39;t hide the line numbers

00:14:57.479 --> 00:15:00.778
Caption: go back into zen mode

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.219
Caption: so I can still have my line numbers in

00:15:00.778 --> 00:15:04.018
Caption: there because I like I remember I find

00:15:02.219 --> 00:15:05.759
Caption: that useful so I can navigate up and

00:15:04.018 --> 00:15:07.398
Caption: down or I know where uh where I&#39;m at and

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:10.018
Caption: things like that

00:15:07.398 --> 00:15:12.778
Caption: customize it for the way that you want

00:15:10.018 --> 00:15:14.760
Caption: to use it it&#39;s not just the it&#39;s not

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:17.159
Caption: just trying to be an editor that is

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.179
Caption: generic and you like it forces you to

00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:20.099
Caption: work in a particular way no you

00:15:18.179 --> 00:15:21.179
Caption: customize it for the needs that you&#39;ve

00:15:20.099 --> 00:15:22.919
Caption: got

00:15:21.179 --> 00:15:26.099
Caption: and I&#39;m just going to turn that back on

00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:28.799
Caption: so that my zen mode is nice

00:15:26.099 --> 00:15:31.679
Caption: clean

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:33.719
Caption: um from uh from an accessibility

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:36.539
Caption: standpoint there&#39;s been a lot of work in

00:15:33.719 --> 00:15:37.439
Caption: vs code to make that uh an easy Editor

00:15:36.539 --> 00:15:39.239
Caption: to use

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.760
Caption: um and something that

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:43.799
Caption: I think that people don&#39;t consider um

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.940
Caption: too much and and what and I know I

00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:46.820
Caption: didn&#39;t consider this for a long time but

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:49.919
Caption: I used to work uh with a colleague who

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:52.078
Caption: has albinism and he had very poor

00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:55.018
Caption: eyesight as a result of that so he had

00:15:52.078 --> 00:15:57.119
Caption: to have his font um incredibly large so

00:15:55.018 --> 00:16:00.119
Caption: that he could read it and and that kind

00:15:57.119 --> 00:16:01.919
Caption: of stuff but that can be a problem when

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:03.659
Caption: you&#39;re working on code files because we

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:05.760
Caption: tend to well

00:16:03.659 --> 00:16:08.398
Caption: I&#39;m lazy so I just you know write things

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.739
Caption: as long as I can I I&#39;ve got a giant

00:16:08.398 --> 00:16:13.440
Caption: screen at home and a reasonable enough

00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:15.239
Caption: eyesight so I&#39;m quite content to have

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.859
Caption: you know hundreds and hundreds of

00:16:15.239 --> 00:16:18.898
Caption: characters spread across a 32 inch

00:16:16.859 --> 00:16:21.539
Caption: monitor because that&#39;s like that&#39;s my

00:16:18.898 --> 00:16:24.059
Caption: working experience but that might not be

00:16:21.539 --> 00:16:26.698
Caption: great for everyone on the team so we can

00:16:24.059 --> 00:16:29.518
Caption: turn on editor rules in uh

00:16:26.698 --> 00:16:31.979
Caption: there&#39;s code whoops let me just control

00:16:29.518 --> 00:16:33.179
Caption: control K control U to comment and

00:16:31.979 --> 00:16:36.059
Caption: uncomment

00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:39.179
Caption: um so control uh yeah control K is yeah

00:16:36.059 --> 00:16:40.078
Caption: okay U is uncomment control K C is to

00:16:39.179 --> 00:16:41.219
Caption: comment

00:16:40.078 --> 00:16:43.018
Caption: um but there we are so I&#39;ve turned on

00:16:41.219 --> 00:16:45.059
Caption: some editor rules um and so you can see

00:16:43.018 --> 00:16:47.578
Caption: these uh lines there or you can maybe

00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:49.078
Caption: make it a bit like get that real retro

00:16:47.578 --> 00:16:51.958
Caption: experience and just have a whole heap of

00:16:49.078 --> 00:16:53.518
Caption: scan lines across the screen uh but you

00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.138
Caption: can then customize the colors for them

00:16:53.518 --> 00:16:56.820
Caption: and it could be usually it&#39;s like oh

00:16:55.138 --> 00:16:58.859
Caption: well we want to keep to it like an 80

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.679
Caption: character width because we know that

00:16:58.859 --> 00:17:04.619
Caption: there&#39;s someone on our team that that&#39;s

00:17:01.679 --> 00:17:06.540
Caption: kind of the the width of code that they

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:08.040
Caption: can show at any point in time so we

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.660
Caption: don&#39;t just want to be mindful of that so

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.819
Caption: we you know we have an indicator in

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.260
Caption: there or you know you&#39;re you&#39;re working

00:17:11.818 --> 00:17:14.938
Caption: on something that&#39;s got to be shipped to

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.739
Caption: a Mainframe and it is actually like an

00:17:14.938 --> 00:17:17.938
Caption: 80 character width uh terminal that

00:17:16.739 --> 00:17:19.500
Caption: they&#39;re going to be working with so so

00:17:17.938 --> 00:17:21.119
Caption: you want to know where 80 characters is

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.160
Caption: or you&#39;re one of those people that is

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:25.798
Caption: militant about no it doesn&#39;t matter that

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.900
Caption: we can have a curved 49 inch monitor

00:17:25.798 --> 00:17:29.459
Caption: around us I am going to have a fixed

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.739
Caption: width of 80 characters in my texts

00:17:29.459 --> 00:17:34.140
Caption: because that&#39;s that&#39;s what I grew up

00:17:31.739 --> 00:17:35.579
Caption: with uh coding um but yeah it&#39;s just

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.099
Caption: like it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of one of those

00:17:35.579 --> 00:17:39.659
Caption: random little features that I think

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:42.000
Caption: um can be useful particularly when

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:44.760
Caption: you&#39;re considering

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.380
Caption: uh how other people are also going to be

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.660
Caption: working on

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.099
Caption: um a bio code base or something like

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.059
Caption: that for you but we&#39;ll turn them off

00:17:50.099 --> 00:17:52.500
Caption: because they might be a little bit

00:17:51.058 --> 00:17:54.959
Caption: distracted

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.939
Caption: uh another kind of actually I should

00:17:54.959 --> 00:17:59.459
Caption: have kept that open Ctrl shift t

00:17:56.939 --> 00:18:01.859
Caption: open the last file

00:17:59.459 --> 00:18:06.418
Caption: another thing that uh

00:18:01.859 --> 00:18:08.819
Caption: is um is useful and uh I tend to forget

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:10.558
Caption: to turn it on because I I add it for

00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:11.759
Caption: like the demos I do then I take it out

00:18:10.558 --> 00:18:14.219
Caption: because

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.479
Caption: um I don&#39;t try to clean up my uh my

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:17.579
Caption: workspace beforehand and then forget to

00:18:15.479 --> 00:18:20.280
Caption: have it put it back in uh they&#39;re called

00:18:17.579 --> 00:18:22.918
Caption: code actions on save so you want to

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.799
Caption: perform something when uh when the file

00:18:22.918 --> 00:18:29.159
Caption: is being saved that&#39;s what code actions

00:18:25.798 --> 00:18:31.319
Caption: on Save code action on Save

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.299
Caption: and oops

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:35.459
Caption: we can get it to do a variety of

00:18:33.298 --> 00:18:37.918
Caption: different things so what

00:18:35.459 --> 00:18:40.500
Caption: control space one of those is organize

00:18:37.918 --> 00:18:42.418
Caption: Imports so we&#39;re going to hit set that

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:46.798
Caption: to true so let&#39;s say that we&#39;re working

00:18:42.418 --> 00:18:49.619
Caption: on like a Javascript file one here and

00:18:46.798 --> 00:18:51.298
Caption: we&#39;ve got a like a a linting rule where

00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:52.798
Caption: we have to we want to keep the order of

00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:54.599
Caption: our Imports in an alphabetical manner

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:57.839
Caption: it&#39;s a it&#39;s a fairly common integral

00:18:54.599 --> 00:18:59.459
Caption: well I&#39;ve got them a bit uh back with

00:18:57.839 --> 00:19:01.140
Caption: you because I want the destructor

00:18:59.459 --> 00:19:03.839
Caption: Imports at the very top

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:07.919
Caption: so I can go control shift p and then uh

00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:09.538
Caption: all organize Imports or shift alt o is

00:19:07.918 --> 00:19:10.439
Caption: the the default shortcut key for that

00:19:09.538 --> 00:19:11.819
Caption: one

00:19:10.439 --> 00:19:15.000
Caption: I can hit it and it&#39;s going to do that

00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:17.699
Caption: for me or with code actions on Save now

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.380
Caption: as soon as I hit Ctrl s to save the file

00:19:17.699 --> 00:19:21.899
Caption: it&#39;s going to just run that for me yeah

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.160
Caption: it just like it&#39;s a useful little thing

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.299
Caption: particularly if like those are the sorts

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.739
Caption: of things that you&#39;re putting in your

00:19:24.298 --> 00:19:26.939
Caption: like your linting rules

00:19:25.739 --> 00:19:29.939
Caption: um there&#39;s also another one in there for

00:19:26.939 --> 00:19:31.678
Caption: uh for fix all um so it&#39;ll uh if you&#39;ve

00:19:29.939 --> 00:19:34.379
Caption: got a like a linter installed that is

00:19:31.678 --> 00:19:35.819
Caption: going to be applying um fixing rules it

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.400
Caption: can try and run those for you so like

00:19:35.819 --> 00:19:40.199
Caption: you know eslint um it&#39;ll try and apply

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.200
Caption: those fixes to the file as you hit save

00:19:40.199 --> 00:19:45.839
Caption: so okay just like little quality of life

00:19:43.199 --> 00:19:47.939
Caption: improvements that are there

00:19:45.839 --> 00:19:49.319
Caption: uh

00:19:47.939 --> 00:19:51.379
Caption: come back

00:19:49.319 --> 00:19:51.380
Caption: um

00:19:51.418 --> 00:19:56.699
Caption: oh uh the last one from a setting

00:19:54.538 --> 00:19:58.859
Caption: standpoint that could be useful is this

00:19:56.699 --> 00:19:59.599
Caption: default editor language

00:19:58.859 --> 00:20:02.579
Caption: um

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:05.520
Caption: what it will do is it will attempt to

00:20:02.579 --> 00:20:08.038
Caption: work out from the workspace

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.900
Caption: what is the most common programming

00:20:08.038 --> 00:20:12.058
Caption: language of the files that are in there

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.219
Caption: and when you do control n to create a

00:20:12.058 --> 00:20:16.079
Caption: new file it will assign that language

00:20:14.219 --> 00:20:18.538
Caption: service to the new file so you

00:20:16.079 --> 00:20:20.519
Caption: immediately get your code completion

00:20:18.538 --> 00:20:22.918
Caption: turned on for the file you immediately

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.839
Caption: get the correct like syntax highlighting

00:20:22.918 --> 00:20:26.459
Caption: and colorizations and stuff like that

00:20:24.839 --> 00:20:29.279
Caption: but you can actually overwrite that

00:20:26.459 --> 00:20:31.500
Caption: setting uh so you know I want new files

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.619
Caption: in this repo to be always defaulted to

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:36.780
Caption: markdown for example I do that for my my

00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:38.219
Caption: blog is running in markdown so I default

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:41.160
Caption: the files to always be marked down

00:20:38.219 --> 00:20:42.599
Caption: unless I change the the the file with

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.780
Caption: Ctrl k m

00:20:42.599 --> 00:20:47.459
Caption: it&#39;s okay m not control K control M Ctrl

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.960
Caption: k m and that&#39;s how we can change the

00:20:47.459 --> 00:20:51.058
Caption: language of the file

00:20:48.959 --> 00:20:53.038
Caption: um and so yeah but you can you can set

00:20:51.058 --> 00:20:54.119
Caption: you can let vs code attempt to figure

00:20:53.038 --> 00:20:56.459
Caption: out what should be the default language

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:58.140
Caption: for a new file or you can force that uh

00:20:56.459 --> 00:21:00.479
Caption: with settings

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:03.320
Caption: um active active editor language is the

00:21:00.479 --> 00:21:03.319
Caption: the default that&#39;s there

00:21:03.479 --> 00:21:06.020
Caption: all right

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.859
Caption: we&#39;ll come back to slides for a minute

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:16.619
Caption: because I want to talk about extensions

00:21:13.219 --> 00:21:17.900
Caption: vs code has a huge amount of

00:21:16.619 --> 00:21:21.178
Caption: extensibility

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:23.520
Caption: and out of that has grown a massive

00:21:21.178 --> 00:21:25.199
Caption: extensions ecosystem everyone&#39;s going to

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.419
Caption: have their favorite extension that you

00:21:25.199 --> 00:21:29.158
Caption: should have installed or that they

00:21:27.418 --> 00:21:31.859
Caption: believe is that it&#39;s going to change the

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:33.539
Caption: way that you use vs code and there are

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:34.918
Caption: literally thousands of extensions so I

00:21:33.538 --> 00:21:36.000
Caption: am not going to cover them all off in

00:21:34.918 --> 00:21:38.279
Caption: here I&#39;m just going to talk about a

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.199
Caption: couple that I think are really useful

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:43.080
Caption: and that I&#39;ve got installed on my

00:21:40.199 --> 00:21:44.158
Caption: machine and they&#39;re generic ones they&#39;re

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:46.678
Caption: not

00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:48.720
Caption: um they&#39;re not specific to a particular

00:21:46.678 --> 00:21:51.058
Caption: programming language or anything like

00:21:48.719 --> 00:21:53.520
Caption: that so these are these are six um top

00:21:51.058 --> 00:21:56.158
Caption: ones for me um editor config for vs code

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.558
Caption: so editor config if you&#39;re unfamiliar

00:21:56.159 --> 00:22:02.539
Caption: with it is a file that you can put into

00:21:58.558 --> 00:22:05.640
Caption: a repo that that you use to define the

00:22:02.538 --> 00:22:07.439
Caption: set default things about a file like

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.780
Caption: what is the default line encoding how

00:22:07.439 --> 00:22:12.178
Caption: many are we using tabs or spaces now

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.159
Caption: what&#39;s in default indentation depth and

00:22:12.178 --> 00:22:15.779
Caption: you can then set that for

00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:17.580
Caption: um uh like different for different files

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:20.219
Caption: so maybe you&#39;re like your your bash

00:22:17.579 --> 00:22:22.140
Caption: files they need to have an LF as the

00:22:20.219 --> 00:22:24.298
Caption: default line encoding whereas other

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.859
Caption: files you might want to have a crlf as

00:22:24.298 --> 00:22:28.319
Caption: the the line encoding and then you can

00:22:25.859 --> 00:22:30.000
Caption: and so that that one&#39;s a useful one just

00:22:28.319 --> 00:22:31.319
Caption: to enforce standardization with inside

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.140
Caption: of a code base

00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:36.119
Caption: I&#39;ll get on pull requests and issues uh

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.859
Caption: just manage all your GitHub stuff uh

00:22:36.119 --> 00:22:40.020
Caption: what full requested issues aspects of

00:22:37.859 --> 00:22:41.459
Caption: GitHub from within vs code don&#39;t have to

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.979
Caption: jump out to the website don&#39;t have to

00:22:41.459 --> 00:22:46.199
Caption: jump out to the the GitHub

00:22:43.979 --> 00:22:49.079
Caption: um uh desktop application or anything

00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:50.760
Caption: like that um just do it from vs code

00:22:49.079 --> 00:22:53.640
Caption: um rest client if you&#39;re doing anything

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.859
Caption: that involves calling apis rest client

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.599
Caption: is so useful

00:22:55.859 --> 00:22:59.280
Caption: um it&#39;s the same as like Postman and

00:22:57.599 --> 00:23:01.859
Caption: Insomniac and all those sorts of tools

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.320
Caption: so it allows you to invoke HTTP

00:23:01.859 --> 00:23:07.260
Caption: um requests but the advantage of rest

00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:09.479
Caption: client is that you create a file and

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:12.000
Caption: then you just execute the things out of

00:23:09.479 --> 00:23:14.400
Caption: that file so you can have you know your

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.659
Caption: examples of how to call an API as a file

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.559
Caption: that you just check in part of your git

00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:18.840
Caption: repo

00:23:16.558 --> 00:23:20.699
Caption: and then you like it&#39;s it&#39;s all there

00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:22.260
Caption: it&#39;s all in one location and you can

00:23:20.699 --> 00:23:23.819
Caption: then execute those from uh with the side

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.260
Caption: of vs code

00:23:23.819 --> 00:23:27.359
Caption: uh peacock this was actually written by

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:30.000
Caption: a colleague of mine at Microsoft uh and

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:31.979
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s what a what it does is it

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.400
Caption: changes the colors of like the borders

00:23:31.979 --> 00:23:37.380
Caption: of vs code so you would have seen uh the

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.820
Caption: one that I had uh

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.219
Caption: where is it

00:23:38.819 --> 00:23:42.959
Caption: it&#39;s my lovely background

00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:45.119
Caption: uh so see how this has got the green

00:23:42.959 --> 00:23:46.500
Caption: around it uh peacock&#39;s done that so if

00:23:45.119 --> 00:23:48.839
Caption: you&#39;ve got a couple of vs code instances

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.979
Caption: open maybe you want to um you set

00:23:48.839 --> 00:23:52.319
Caption: different colors on them so you know

00:23:49.979 --> 00:23:55.880
Caption: which one it is as your old tabbing

00:23:52.319 --> 00:24:00.418
Caption: um between your uh between your windows

00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:02.940
Caption: uh code spell checker funny story was uh

00:24:00.418 --> 00:24:05.339
Caption: when I was working for a company a

00:24:02.939 --> 00:24:07.379
Caption: number of years ago we were um we were

00:24:05.339 --> 00:24:09.500
Caption: building a custom CRM and we needed to

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.640
Caption: keep track of our person name history

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.140
Caption: because you know if someone changed

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.640
Caption: their name we need to attract that so we

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.260
Caption: created a table called person name

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.640
Caption: history

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.479
Caption: also we thought that&#39;s what we named the

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.979
Caption: table

00:24:18.479 --> 00:24:21.058
Caption: it wasn&#39;t until several months later

00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:24.479
Caption: that we realized that we&#39;d actually

00:24:21.058 --> 00:24:26.459
Caption: named the table person named his Troy

00:24:24.479 --> 00:24:27.900
Caption: we&#39;d also read in customer RM it had

00:24:26.459 --> 00:24:29.760
Caption: generated a whole bunch of C sharp code

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.859
Caption: from the database so we had all these

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.900
Caption: classes called person name history

00:24:31.859 --> 00:24:35.339
Caption: uh you would get that person if you have

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.679
Caption: a collection of person named his Troy&#39;s

00:24:35.339 --> 00:24:40.619
Caption: uh and all that kind of stuff

00:24:37.678 --> 00:24:41.939
Caption: um it was then like this was then in in

00:24:40.619 --> 00:24:43.439
Caption: testing and it was just it was too hard

00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:44.579
Caption: to go back and fix it so like oh well

00:24:43.439 --> 00:24:47.178
Caption: we&#39;re shipping to production with person

00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:47.178
Caption: name his choice

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.119
Caption: you want an extension like this one like

00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:53.399
Caption: code spell check

00:24:51.119 --> 00:24:56.099
Caption: sure you don&#39;t do that

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.780
Caption: um I I and I&#39;m just horrendously bad at

00:24:56.099 --> 00:24:59.038
Caption: spelling you know the best of times so I

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.559
Caption: use that on my blog and it&#39;s just like

00:24:59.038 --> 00:25:03.479
Caption: it&#39;s just so nice and uh that I could

00:25:01.558 --> 00:25:05.339
Caption: just not have to worry about that

00:25:03.479 --> 00:25:07.558
Caption: uh and then the last one is to do

00:25:05.339 --> 00:25:10.020
Caption: highlight so uh to do how I&#39;d actually

00:25:07.558 --> 00:25:12.359
Caption: like to use with uh the GitHub uh one so

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.159
Caption: where where you put likewife or like put

00:25:12.359 --> 00:25:15.900
Caption: a comment in you know to do I&#39;m totally

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:17.880
Caption: going to fix this code later

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.140
Caption: like and you totally gonna come back and

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.760
Caption: do that right

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.440
Caption: um what what to do highlight will do is

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.298
Caption: it will actually find all those in and

00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:25.739
Caption: give you a list of that like you can see

00:25:24.298 --> 00:25:26.699
Caption: that with inside of vs code like here&#39;s

00:25:25.739 --> 00:25:28.020
Caption: all the to-do&#39;s you&#39;ve got with inside

00:25:26.699 --> 00:25:29.278
Caption: of the solution

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:31.799
Caption: um but then I combine that with the

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:34.080
Caption: GitHub full requests and issues so that

00:25:31.798 --> 00:25:36.000
Caption: you you just select that to do and then

00:25:34.079 --> 00:25:37.918
Caption: immediately create a GitHub issue out of

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.119
Caption: that so that it&#39;s not just in the code

00:25:37.918 --> 00:25:40.678
Caption: base that you&#39;re totally going to fix it

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:41.640
Caption: later it&#39;s also in your GitHub issues

00:25:40.678 --> 00:25:42.538
Caption: that you&#39;re totally going to come back

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.339
Caption: and fix

00:25:42.538 --> 00:25:46.259
Caption: and you just gets de-prioritized down

00:25:44.339 --> 00:25:49.380
Caption: the back

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:51.058
Caption: um yeah uh these things are like yeah

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.500
Caption: the ones that I find really useful and

00:25:51.058 --> 00:25:53.579
Caption: like I said these aren&#39;t specific to any

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.339
Caption: kind of program you&#39;re like whether

00:25:53.579 --> 00:25:58.140
Caption: you&#39;re writing markdown or python or net

00:25:56.339 --> 00:25:59.520
Caption: or whatever um these can all help out

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.739
Caption: there

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.599
Caption: but I&#39;m a web developer at heart uh so I

00:26:01.739 --> 00:26:05.939
Caption: want to talk about a couple of

00:26:03.599 --> 00:26:09.239
Caption: um my favorite uh web developer or

00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:12.058
Caption: JavaScript developer extensions

00:26:09.239 --> 00:26:14.520
Caption: um and uh since my animations are not

00:26:12.058 --> 00:26:17.278
Caption: quite right uh so

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.859
Caption: um prettier so uh if you&#39;re if you&#39;re

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:21.659
Caption: doing JavaScript projects prettier is

00:26:19.859 --> 00:26:23.640
Caption: kind of like it&#39;s the de facto standard

00:26:21.659 --> 00:26:25.740
Caption: I think at the moment for doing

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.359
Caption: um code formatting uh for JavaScript

00:26:25.739 --> 00:26:29.278
Caption: applications it also does like HTML and

00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:31.439
Caption: CSS and I think a couple other languages

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:33.600
Caption: markdown stuff like that there is an

00:26:31.439 --> 00:26:36.658
Caption: extension for vs code so that uh like

00:26:33.599 --> 00:26:38.699
Caption: you don&#39;t have to do anything it just uh

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:40.559
Caption: it includes it and then it gets you can

00:26:38.699 --> 00:26:43.019
Caption: set that as the default format of

00:26:40.558 --> 00:26:45.359
Caption: formatter for for the right files are

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.979
Caption: you JavaScript files so when you um in

00:26:45.359 --> 00:26:49.260
Caption: vs code you tell it to format the file

00:26:46.979 --> 00:26:50.939
Caption: it will execute prettier for you uh

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.199
Caption: combine that with eslint so then you can

00:26:50.939 --> 00:26:54.000
Caption: get your linting

00:26:52.199 --> 00:26:55.979
Caption: um rules uh the the linting information

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Caption: surfaced up with inside of the editor so

00:26:55.979 --> 00:26:58.739
Caption: you can quickly jump around and find

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.599
Caption: those without having to wait until the

00:26:58.739 --> 00:27:02.939
Caption: CIA build has failed because you didn&#39;t

00:27:00.599 --> 00:27:05.699
Caption: run uh npm no you didn&#39;t run your yield

00:27:02.939 --> 00:27:08.038
Caption: into before pushing uh npm

00:27:05.699 --> 00:27:10.260
Caption: um this is a just a useful extension uh

00:27:08.038 --> 00:27:12.178
Caption: for working with npm I will like when

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.279
Caption: you&#39;re working in a package Json file uh

00:27:12.178 --> 00:27:15.658
Caption: you can do control space uh on the

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:16.799
Caption: version and we&#39;ll show you the the

00:27:15.659 --> 00:27:18.600
Caption: vision

00:27:16.798 --> 00:27:21.899
Caption: um versions available for that package

00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:22.558
Caption: and also give you like the the December

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.419

Caption: yeah you can uh make sure your lucky

00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:35.158
Caption: patch is the right point and the last

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.279
Caption: one is

00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:40.799
Caption: um we shift uh for vs code a bunch of

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:42.179
Caption: extent an extension for uh Edge so that

00:27:40.798 --> 00:27:44.819
Caption: you can do

00:27:42.178 --> 00:27:46.500
Caption: um like work with the browser from vs

00:27:44.819 --> 00:27:47.699
Caption: code and I&#39;m going to have a crack at

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.859
Caption: actually testing that one out now

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:52.739
Caption: because I totally didn&#39;t just try and do

00:27:49.859 --> 00:27:54.719
Caption: this before okay before I came to uh

00:27:52.739 --> 00:27:57.418
Caption: into the room for the session I totally

00:27:54.719 --> 00:27:59.158
Caption: this was all pre-planned and done this

00:27:57.418 --> 00:28:01.380
Caption: is the day-to-day Perth website

00:27:59.159 --> 00:28:03.059
Caption: I brought it down um I&#39;m gonna let&#39;s do

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:06.959
Caption: npm start

00:28:03.058 --> 00:28:08.520
Caption: and we&#39;ll see if that works there we go

00:28:06.959 --> 00:28:10.079
Caption: um and I do have the edge extension

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.599
Caption: installed uh so the edge extension I

00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:14.158
Caption: think it also works with chrome to a

00:28:12.599 --> 00:28:17.939
Caption: degree so because it&#39;s it&#39;s chromium

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:22.260
Caption: browsers but this is

00:28:17.939 --> 00:28:24.418
Caption: not working fantastic all right

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:27.539
Caption: um well the

00:28:24.418 --> 00:28:29.099
Caption: oh I had to do like npm building npm run

00:28:27.538 --> 00:28:30.778
Caption: build

00:28:29.099 --> 00:28:32.219
Caption: I totally didn&#39;t read that readme either

00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:33.900
Caption: so I was just like I can clone this run

00:28:32.219 --> 00:28:37.798
Caption: npm install and yeah like everything

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:40.739
Caption: will be fine yep yep that might not be

00:28:37.798 --> 00:28:43.558
Caption: fine that&#39;s going to take a while um

00:28:40.739 --> 00:28:45.599
Caption: let&#39;s try I&#39;ll show I&#39;ll show us a

00:28:43.558 --> 00:28:49.079
Caption: slightly different uh

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:51.479
Caption: one of it that does work but not quite

00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:53.640
Caption: as much as I wanted there uh so oh

00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:55.140
Caption: another one from there task and then

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.940
Caption: these are uh scripts that I&#39;ve already

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:59.219
Caption: got inside of my repo uh that I can run

00:28:56.939 --> 00:29:01.079
Caption: uh this is my this is my blog I&#39;m just

00:28:59.219 --> 00:29:02.579
Caption: going to uh run the the little web

00:29:01.079 --> 00:29:04.859
Caption: server for that

00:29:02.579 --> 00:29:06.479
Caption: it&#39;s open and now I&#39;m going to use the

00:29:04.859 --> 00:29:07.319
Caption: edge extension which I&#39;ve got installed

00:29:06.479 --> 00:29:10.260
Caption: here

00:29:07.319 --> 00:29:13.439
Caption: and there it is I have my website there

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:16.739
Caption: and I want to hit open

00:29:13.439 --> 00:29:18.178
Caption: so there we go I I do apologize it is

00:29:16.739 --> 00:29:22.199
Caption: going to be very cramped because it&#39;s

00:29:18.178 --> 00:29:24.239
Caption: all zoomed in for the editor but there&#39;s

00:29:22.199 --> 00:29:25.798
Caption: my there&#39;s my website on one side and

00:29:24.239 --> 00:29:29.819
Caption: there&#39;s a Dom inspector on the other

00:29:25.798 --> 00:29:31.019
Caption: side so I could go hey let&#39;s find

00:29:29.819 --> 00:29:33.898
Caption: that element

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:35.520
Caption: so I can like I can ins like all that

00:29:33.899 --> 00:29:39.299
Caption: Dom inspectory goodness that&#39;s there I

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.440
Caption: have the the CSS um information there uh

00:29:39.298 --> 00:29:42.178
Caption: you probably can&#39;t read that unless

00:29:40.439 --> 00:29:45.000
Caption: you&#39;re in the front view rows but uh I&#39;m

00:29:42.178 --> 00:29:46.918
Caption: actually using SAS to uh instead of like

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.339
Caption: raw CSS so I&#39;m compiling that down to

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:51.538
Caption: CSS and that&#39;s telling me this is uh

00:29:49.339 --> 00:29:53.099
Caption: banner.scss file

00:29:51.538 --> 00:29:55.379
Caption: um and

00:29:53.099 --> 00:29:57.359
Caption: if I wasn&#39;t

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.319
Caption: using it in the way that I&#39;m using it I

00:29:57.359 --> 00:29:59.640
Caption: could actually click through that file

00:29:58.319 --> 00:30:01.500
Caption: and we&#39;ll go through the file and disk

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.779
Caption: unfortunately it&#39;s not working in this

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:07.199
Caption: particular vs code instance because I&#39;m

00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:08.880
Caption: connected to a remote machine and it

00:30:07.199 --> 00:30:10.678
Caption: doesn&#39;t like so it can&#39;t access the file

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.880
Caption: system uh properly to do that pass

00:30:10.678 --> 00:30:13.619
Caption: through that&#39;s why I was trying to get

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.579
Caption: this one up and running and it&#39;s a good

00:30:13.619 --> 00:30:15.899
Caption: idea that I didn&#39;t wait for that because

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:18.000
Caption: it&#39;s still building

00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:19.919
Caption: um but if if you&#39;re working with it just

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.260
Caption: like directly on your Mac or Windows

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:24.178
Caption: machine or Linux machine then um like it

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:26.640
Caption: like you can click through to that file

00:30:24.178 --> 00:30:29.278
Caption: if you edit in the Styles editor with

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:31.619
Caption: inside of this extension here it will

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:33.480
Caption: actually push those to the file on disk

00:30:31.619 --> 00:30:35.219
Caption: so like you know just like full

00:30:33.479 --> 00:30:38.158
Caption: real-time feedback loop that you get

00:30:35.219 --> 00:30:39.839
Caption: there yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a really Nifty

00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:41.220
Caption: extension and I&#39;m not just trying to

00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:42.418
Caption: pimp it because I work for Microsoft and

00:30:41.219 --> 00:30:43.380
Caption: I think Edge is actually a decent

00:30:42.418 --> 00:30:45.000
Caption: browser

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:47.099
Caption: um like being able to like have like

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.558
Caption: having everything contextually in the

00:30:47.099 --> 00:30:51.719
Caption: one location I find is quite useful

00:30:49.558 --> 00:30:53.339
Caption: all right

00:30:51.719 --> 00:30:55.619
Caption: now

00:30:53.339 --> 00:30:57.418
Caption: I did Consulting work for nearly a

00:30:55.619 --> 00:30:59.880
Caption: decade before joining Microsoft and

00:30:57.418 --> 00:31:02.339
Caption: something that was always frustrating

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.319
Caption: when uh I was doing my Consulting work

00:31:02.339 --> 00:31:07.439
Caption: was that I would come to a new client

00:31:04.319 --> 00:31:09.479
Caption: and be like cool ma&#39;am welcome

00:31:07.439 --> 00:31:12.119
Caption: um here&#39;s your machine

00:31:09.479 --> 00:31:13.859
Caption: boom big pile of paper uh that&#39;s the

00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:15.599
Caption: setup guide for your machine we&#39;ll see

00:31:13.859 --> 00:31:17.278
Caption: at the end of the week who&#39;s who&#39;s

00:31:15.599 --> 00:31:18.599
Caption: experienced something like that I&#39;m

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:21.600
Caption: saying I&#39;ve seen a lot of heads tonight

00:31:18.599 --> 00:31:23.339
Caption: yeah it and just like

00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:26.099
Caption: I feel bad because like I know how much

00:31:23.339 --> 00:31:27.359
Caption: I&#39;m billing for you to be here and

00:31:26.099 --> 00:31:28.798
Caption: you&#39;re telling me it&#39;s going to take me

00:31:27.359 --> 00:31:30.839
Caption: a week before I can be productive

00:31:28.798 --> 00:31:32.099
Caption: because I&#39;ve got to you know like and

00:31:30.839 --> 00:31:34.439
Caption: you go through it and then it doesn&#39;t

00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:36.898
Caption: work anyway oh yeah sorry it turns out

00:31:34.439 --> 00:31:38.879
Caption: that um no we&#39;re actually using the the

00:31:36.899 --> 00:31:40.559
Caption: newer version of Reddit sorry just not

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.760
Caption: like not the old version that&#39;s listed

00:31:40.558 --> 00:31:43.319
Caption: in there can you actually got to

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.520
Caption: download the new can you can you upgrade

00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:47.038
Caption: that or

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:50.339
Caption: um oh yeah we&#39;ve we forgot to add this

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:51.959
Caption: step or actually can you go talk to uh

00:31:50.339 --> 00:31:53.640
Caption: this person on the other side of the

00:31:51.959 --> 00:31:55.020
Caption: room because they&#39;re going to have to

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.219
Caption: help you um because yeah we haven&#39;t

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:58.020
Caption: documented some of the new stuff that

00:31:56.219 --> 00:32:00.298
Caption: they&#39;ve added to the uh the environment

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:01.558
Caption: and like ah it&#39;s just it&#39;s so

00:32:00.298 --> 00:32:03.599
Caption: frustrating

00:32:01.558 --> 00:32:05.760
Caption: um but with vs code

00:32:03.599 --> 00:32:07.918
Caption: um one of the one of the things we can

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.419
Caption: do with that is uh I mentioned before

00:32:07.918 --> 00:32:10.739
Caption: like editor config and things like that

00:32:09.418 --> 00:32:12.479
Caption: just to reinforce them like code

00:32:10.739 --> 00:32:13.678
Caption: standardization but you can even do that

00:32:12.479 --> 00:32:15.000
Caption: to the point of like editor

00:32:13.678 --> 00:32:16.798
Caption: standardization

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.260
Caption: where

00:32:16.798 --> 00:32:22.500
Caption: um where we can have inside of our DOT

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:23.579
Caption: vs code folder uh we can include things

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.640
Caption: like

00:32:23.579 --> 00:32:28.619
Caption: settings so settings that are specific

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:30.839
Caption: for this repo so when you open this repo

00:32:28.619 --> 00:32:33.839
Caption: in vs code these settings are going to

00:32:30.839 --> 00:32:36.778
Caption: be applied so like if if you&#39;ve got like

00:32:33.839 --> 00:32:37.918
Caption: a you know default file extension that

00:32:36.779 --> 00:32:39.659
Caption: you want to set you can set that just

00:32:37.918 --> 00:32:41.038
Caption: for this project so that you opened up

00:32:39.659 --> 00:32:43.620
Caption: you&#39;re not having to set this on a

00:32:41.038 --> 00:32:46.199
Caption: machine wide wide config

00:32:43.619 --> 00:32:48.418
Caption: um another one I don&#39;t have it in this

00:32:46.199 --> 00:32:51.719
Caption: one but I think I might have it in

00:32:48.418 --> 00:32:54.119
Caption: actually I&#39;ll have it in here maybe

00:32:51.719 --> 00:32:57.479
Caption: I have so many oh there&#39;s so many things

00:32:54.119 --> 00:32:58.798
Caption: open uh whoops let&#39;s collapse that

00:32:57.479 --> 00:33:02.219
Caption: now

00:32:58.798 --> 00:33:04.558
Caption: uh you can also include uh I don&#39;t have

00:33:02.219 --> 00:33:08.038
Caption: extensions in this one either ah but I

00:33:04.558 --> 00:33:10.079
Caption: know where it was I did see one earlier

00:33:08.038 --> 00:33:12.178
Caption: inside of this vs code folder

00:33:10.079 --> 00:33:14.038
Caption: extensions so these are recommended

00:33:12.178 --> 00:33:16.558
Caption: extensions that you should have to work

00:33:14.038 --> 00:33:17.759
Caption: on this particular project so they&#39;re um

00:33:16.558 --> 00:33:19.380
Caption: they&#39;re encourage you to install the

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.719
Caption: Chrome debugger which ironically is

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.558
Caption: actually deprecated

00:33:20.719 --> 00:33:25.199
Caption: they&#39;re recommending that you install

00:33:22.558 --> 00:33:27.000
Caption: editor config and prettier and and uh

00:33:25.199 --> 00:33:29.518
Caption: ESPN so what will happen is when you

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.899
Caption: open up this uh this folder in vs code

00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:32.399
Caption: if you don&#39;t have those extensions

00:33:30.899 --> 00:33:34.080
Caption: installed you&#39;ll get a note noticing

00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:36.119
Caption: there are recommended extensions would

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:37.558
Caption: you like to install them so that way you

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:39.058
Caption: can make sure that everyone&#39;s kind of

00:33:37.558 --> 00:33:41.479
Caption: got that same sort of development

00:33:39.058 --> 00:33:41.479
Caption: experience

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:47.058
Caption: but

00:33:43.918 --> 00:33:47.058
Caption: let&#39;s go back into the slides

00:33:47.279 --> 00:33:50.700
Caption: in a moment there we go

00:33:49.079 --> 00:33:52.500
Caption: but there&#39;s another level we can take

00:33:50.699 --> 00:33:55.619
Caption: this to and that&#39;s with a feature of vs

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.640
Caption: code uh called uh Dev containers

00:33:55.619 --> 00:33:59.399
Caption: so

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.140
Caption: a Dev container is a way to dockerize

00:33:59.399 --> 00:34:05.100
Caption: the development environment that you&#39;re

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:06.959
Caption: working in or dockerize the the

00:34:05.099 --> 00:34:09.000
Caption: yeah the thing that you&#39;re you&#39;re

00:34:06.959 --> 00:34:11.820
Caption: building with and

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.618
Caption: then because it&#39;s in a environment&#39;s in

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:16.020
Caption: a docking container you can control

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:18.299
Caption: what&#39;s there so you can pre-install like

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.339
Caption: the correct version of node or net or go

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:24.119
Caption: or whatever runtime you&#39;re working with

00:34:20.339 --> 00:34:25.080
Caption: you can pre-install like a database

00:34:24.118 --> 00:34:26.819
Caption: um and

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.619
Caption: I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m Gonna Keep just dropping

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.379
Caption: in and out of my slides

00:34:28.618 --> 00:34:33.358
Caption: uh so

00:34:30.378 --> 00:34:34.979
Caption: this project Yep this one here so this

00:34:33.358 --> 00:34:36.658
Caption: is one of my open source projects it&#39;s a

00:34:34.979 --> 00:34:38.280
Caption: F-sharp project if anyone wants to talk

00:34:36.658 --> 00:34:39.598
Caption: F sharp come see me I&#39;m like probably

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.099
Caption: the only person here that actually cares

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:44.460
Caption: about that but it&#39;s awesome and if

00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:45.720
Caption: you&#39;re a DOT net developer learn F-sharp

00:34:44.459 --> 00:34:49.979
Caption: um but this is a project for working

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:51.598
Caption: with uh Cosmos DB uh from F-sharp but

00:34:49.979 --> 00:34:53.098
Caption: for local development well I don&#39;t have

00:34:51.599 --> 00:34:54.780
Caption: to speed up an Azure resource for for

00:34:53.099 --> 00:34:57.780
Caption: Cosmos Divi or if someone wants to come

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.159
Caption: along and contribute a fix to it or a

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.540
Caption: feature or anything like that I don&#39;t

00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:02.939
Caption: want them to have to stand up at Azure

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.679
Caption: account stand up for a cosmos instance

00:35:02.939 --> 00:35:06.838
Caption: inside of there so I have a Dev

00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:09.059
Caption: container that does that for you

00:35:06.839 --> 00:35:11.280
Caption: um this one is using uh Docker compose

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:12.540
Caption: so it has the environment that you&#39;re

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.280
Caption: going to be actually developing with

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:16.859
Caption: inside of so this will pre-install

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.599
Caption: the.net runtime for you the correct

00:35:16.858 --> 00:35:21.358
Caption: version because I&#39;m working on dot net

00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:24.480
Caption: six so that&#39;ll all be pre-installed for

00:35:21.358 --> 00:35:27.598
Caption: you plus a few tools make uh for working

00:35:24.479 --> 00:35:29.399
Caption: with F sharp but then I have a another

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:31.200
Caption: Docker container that started up next to

00:35:29.399 --> 00:35:34.919
Caption: it which is going to be the cosmos DB

00:35:31.199 --> 00:35:36.479
Caption: emulator I then also so when I open in

00:35:34.919 --> 00:35:37.739
Caption: vs code it detects this Dev Contender

00:35:36.479 --> 00:35:40.079
Caption: says hey do you want to run this as a

00:35:37.739 --> 00:35:41.639
Caption: Dev container you do that it will start

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:42.839
Caption: this all up

00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:46.199
Caption: um it will start up the the docking

00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:47.760
Caption: container side by side and now I I can

00:35:46.199 --> 00:35:49.800
Caption: do full local development and I haven&#39;t

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.139
Caption: had to install anything other than

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.579
Caption: Docker and vs code

00:35:52.139 --> 00:35:55.618
Caption: um and then if I when I&#39;m finished

00:35:53.579 --> 00:35:58.200
Caption: working on this delete the repo off my

00:35:55.618 --> 00:36:00.239
Caption: machine and I don&#39;t have to uninstall

00:35:58.199 --> 00:36:01.800
Caption: you know the cosmos emulator I don&#39;t

00:36:00.239 --> 00:36:03.959
Caption: have to install the.net framework or

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.339
Caption: anything like that it&#39;s all isolated uh

00:36:03.959 --> 00:36:07.560
Caption: and what this means is that yeah like

00:36:05.339 --> 00:36:09.239
Caption: it&#39;s very easy to come across as like an

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:12.060
Caption: open source contributor pick up a

00:36:09.239 --> 00:36:14.280
Caption: project clone it open it and have all

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:16.680
Caption: this uh like all the environment ready

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:18.119
Caption: to go you haven&#39;t had to read like a a

00:36:16.679 --> 00:36:19.739
Caption: massive contributing guide or anything

00:36:18.118 --> 00:36:22.679
Caption: like that

00:36:19.739 --> 00:36:24.899
Caption: um the the next kind of power of this is

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:27.838
Caption: that if you&#39;re working with GitHub code

00:36:24.899 --> 00:36:29.699
Caption: spaces uh when you open it in code

00:36:27.839 --> 00:36:31.739
Caption: spaces it will detect the dev container

00:36:29.699 --> 00:36:33.659
Caption: and provision the code space through

00:36:31.739 --> 00:36:36.000
Caption: those specifications for you

00:36:33.659 --> 00:36:37.199
Caption: um uh the the GitHub folks um over at

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.540
Caption: the the booth actually have this running

00:36:37.199 --> 00:36:42.959
Caption: uh with another project of mine where it

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:44.699
Caption: is running a cosmos DBA emulator and a a

00:36:42.959 --> 00:36:46.139
Caption: Docker container side-by-side inside of

00:36:44.699 --> 00:36:47.939
Caption: code spaces and they&#39;re running that

00:36:46.139 --> 00:36:50.098
Caption: from a Raspberry Pi so you&#39;re like doing

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:51.899
Caption: full development with two running Docker

00:36:50.099 --> 00:36:53.940
Caption: containers off a Raspberry Pi

00:36:51.899 --> 00:36:55.799
Caption: um but a Dev containers are really

00:36:53.939 --> 00:36:59.540
Caption: useful for doing

00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:01.380
Caption: um so yeah like this remote uh so this

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:03.599
Caption: pre-provisioned environment and it can

00:37:01.379 --> 00:37:07.019
Caption: save so much time you know having to

00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:08.579
Caption: install this uh keep these docs up to

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.959
Caption: date this is the right version of

00:37:08.579 --> 00:37:12.479
Caption: whatever the dependency is that we need

00:37:09.959 --> 00:37:14.219
Caption: to install you have it all there um uh

00:37:12.479 --> 00:37:16.579
Caption: pre-built and combined into this one

00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:16.578
Caption: folder

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:21.540
Caption: um all right we&#39;ve got about

00:37:20.219 --> 00:37:24.118
Caption: um I&#39;m going to leave some time for

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:26.280
Caption: questions at the end um so uh we&#39;ll go

00:37:24.118 --> 00:37:29.699
Caption: for about probably I think well like 10

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:31.500
Caption: minutes left I think uh I&#39;m getting some

00:37:29.699 --> 00:37:32.939
Caption: vagueness on that I&#39;m also the thing

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.820
Caption: that&#39;s standing between everyone and

00:37:32.939 --> 00:37:36.838
Caption: lunch so uh

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.959
Caption: um

00:37:36.839 --> 00:37:41.520
Caption: uh I talked a bit about code spaces but

00:37:39.959 --> 00:37:45.479
Caption: there is

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:47.219
Caption: one other thing that I will show off

00:37:45.479 --> 00:37:50.639
Caption: because I think it is super cool

00:37:47.219 --> 00:37:52.199
Caption: particularly in um and the fact that a

00:37:50.639 --> 00:37:54.358
Caption: lot more of us are working from home now

00:37:52.199 --> 00:37:56.280
Caption: I&#39;ve got to find the right vs code

00:37:54.358 --> 00:38:01.019
Caption: instance that I have open

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:03.419
Caption: where is it here here and I have so many

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:05.520
Caption: vs codes where are all the vs codes it&#39;s

00:38:03.419 --> 00:38:07.979
Caption: not that one

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.060
Caption: is it this one no no I don&#39;t have it on

00:38:07.979 --> 00:38:10.439
Caption: any of them

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:14.599
Caption: um there&#39;s an extension that I&#39;m going

00:38:10.439 --> 00:38:14.598
Caption: to install called live share

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:18.119
Caption: um and this should actually install

00:38:16.439 --> 00:38:21.719
Caption: pretty quickly because I already have it

00:38:18.118 --> 00:38:26.939
Caption: done live share there we go okay so live

00:38:21.719 --> 00:38:29.098
Caption: share is a extension that uh it&#39;s a

00:38:26.939 --> 00:38:33.959
Caption: this is I guess you&#39;d call it a product

00:38:29.099 --> 00:38:35.160
Caption: um we created Microsoft for uh doing

00:38:33.959 --> 00:38:38.000
Caption: um

00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:38.000
Caption: uh remote

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.699
Caption: pair programming I guess probably a good

00:38:40.139 --> 00:38:43.679
Caption: way to do it a good way to describe it

00:38:41.699 --> 00:38:45.959
Caption: so with live share I&#39;m going to hit

00:38:43.679 --> 00:38:47.639
Caption: share now that I&#39;ve installed that

00:38:45.959 --> 00:38:50.939
Caption: and what it&#39;s going to do is it&#39;s going

00:38:47.639 --> 00:38:54.899
Caption: to start up a collaboration session from

00:38:50.939 --> 00:38:57.300
Caption: my machine and uh it&#39;s gonna this is

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:58.439
Caption: probably going to not go as fast as I

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:01.140
Caption: would like it to go and that&#39;s going to

00:38:58.439 --> 00:39:03.419
Caption: be very depressing but by by doing this

00:39:01.139 --> 00:39:05.760
Caption: I can I&#39;ll then end up with a URL that I

00:39:03.419 --> 00:39:07.679
Caption: can give out to you know someone that I

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:10.560
Caption: might be pair programming with and they

00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:13.739
Caption: can connect from their machine uh to

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.119
Caption: essentially my vs code instance but they

00:39:13.739 --> 00:39:16.260
Caption: don&#39;t actually have to have vs code

00:39:15.118 --> 00:39:18.179
Caption: installed they can do it directly from

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:19.739
Caption: the browser they could open it up in

00:39:18.179 --> 00:39:22.618
Caption: full visual studio and live share

00:39:19.739 --> 00:39:25.020
Caption: actually works with um Visual Studio as

00:39:22.618 --> 00:39:27.779
Caption: well as vs code

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:31.399
Caption: that&#39;s it share again ah there we go oh

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:31.400
Caption: cool we&#39;re gonna do a signing dance

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:37.619
Caption: everyone&#39;s gonna learn my password to

00:39:34.919 --> 00:39:39.358
Caption: GitHub that

00:39:37.618 --> 00:39:41.879
Caption: nope I should be already authenticated

00:39:39.358 --> 00:39:44.039
Caption: uh so it&#39;s done okay

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:48.419
Caption: um it&#39;s collaboration session come on

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:50.760
Caption: there we go okay so that is open uh we

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:53.819
Caption: don&#39;t need Dutch I want to grab the URL

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:56.459
Caption: when it starts

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:58.859
Caption: here we go okay

00:39:56.459 --> 00:40:02.520
Caption: session details

00:39:58.858 --> 00:40:04.679
Caption: copy link okay excellent now

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:07.079
Caption: I&#39;m going to paste this into the browser

00:40:04.679 --> 00:40:08.459
Caption: and

00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:10.200
Caption: it&#39;s going to start

00:40:08.459 --> 00:40:12.919
Caption: vs code in the browser

00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:12.919
Caption: so here we go

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.040
Caption: and it&#39;s going to take a few minutes or

00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:18.000
Caption: hopefully not a few minutes it&#39;s going

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.160
Caption: to take a little bit of time because it

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.199
Caption: what it&#39;s doing is it&#39;s talking into my

00:40:20.159 --> 00:40:23.639
Caption: laptop which is actually going uh I&#39;m

00:40:22.199 --> 00:40:25.020
Caption: going to continue on the web which is

00:40:23.639 --> 00:40:27.239
Caption: going over the 5G connection on my phone

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:30.000
Caption: continue is anonymous

00:40:27.239 --> 00:40:33.239
Caption: yeah we&#39;ll call that guest user uh and

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.800
Caption: they are going to be able to uh see like

00:40:33.239 --> 00:40:35.520
Caption: all the files on my machine they&#39;re also

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.320
Caption: going to be able to connect to the

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.439
Caption: locally running web server that I&#39;ve got

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:42.479
Caption: so they can view the the website well

00:40:40.439 --> 00:40:44.159
Caption: which happens to be my blog um there we

00:40:42.479 --> 00:40:45.179
Caption: go so there&#39;s all the files uh starting

00:40:44.159 --> 00:40:48.659
Caption: to come in

00:40:45.179 --> 00:40:51.419
Caption: uh I can open up let&#39;s just pick a

00:40:48.659 --> 00:40:53.039
Caption: random file let&#39;s pick this package Json

00:40:51.419 --> 00:40:56.338
Caption: um it&#39;s going to have syntax

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.859
Caption: highlighting and colorization and all
