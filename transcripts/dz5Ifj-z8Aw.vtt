Caption: welcome back if you could grab your

00:00:01.559 --> 00:00:07.139
Caption: seats we&#39;ve got some lightning talks

00:00:04.619 --> 00:00:08.699
Caption: Lightning Fast lightning talks and I

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.380
Caption: didn&#39;t get a biography so I&#39;ve just made

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.000
Caption: this up after a very brief chat I

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.098
Caption: actually know Brendan so I have a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.718
Caption: Fighting Chance Brendan&#39;s coming to talk

00:00:14.098 --> 00:00:19.380
Caption: to us first for 10 minutes followed by

00:00:15.718 --> 00:00:20.938
Caption: Dan who&#39;s over here Don

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:22.438
Caption: auto correct

00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:25.139
Caption: um

00:00:22.438 --> 00:00:26.759
Caption: Brendan is in my words not his but

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:29.038
Caption: possibly his too who knows a kick-ass

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.720
Caption: consultant and a data magician

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:33.959
Caption: some certainly what he was doing when we

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:36.898
Caption: worked together and then Don not Dan

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:39.479
Caption: um is a multiple hat wearer working in a

00:00:36.898 --> 00:00:41.099
Caption: homegrown Aussie quality consultancy and

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:44.099
Caption: by all accounts doing an awful lot of

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:47.218
Caption: stuff so he might be a bit tired lots of

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:48.180
Caption: energy for Don take it away Brendan very

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.239
Caption: much

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.238
Caption: um

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:56.878
Caption: data magician in the sense that I make

00:00:53.578 --> 00:00:59.038
Caption: my data magically appear and disappear

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.399
Caption: um so I&#39;m going to be talking today

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.319
Caption: about best practice and why we should

00:01:02.398 --> 00:01:08.360
Caption: ban it from our vocabulary

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.360
Caption: forever no excuses

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:13.680
Caption: so first of all what is best practice

00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:15.478
Caption: best practice is

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.959
Caption: defined in a couple of ways so the

00:01:15.478 --> 00:01:20.579
Caption: definite dictionary definition

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:25.259
Caption: is really around

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.500
Caption: research and replicable

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.720
Caption: um replication of it basically

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.119
Caption: um a second definition I found was

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.419
Caption: essentially following the same the same

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.639
Caption: theme around replication uh research and

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:43.139
Caption: really just really going through the

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.279
Caption: different options and finding out what

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:45.720
Caption: is best

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:49.618
Caption: however

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.479
Caption: that is often not what people mean when

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.420
Caption: they talk about best practice

00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:57.539
Caption: uh so first of all I&#39;m going to say that

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:59.158
Caption: again I am a consultant I work across a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.939
Caption: range of different Industries different

00:01:59.158 --> 00:02:04.739
Caption: clients different teams and across the

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.479
Caption: board everyone&#39;s doing things

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.039
Caption: differently everyone thinks they&#39;re

00:02:06.478 --> 00:02:10.199
Caption: doing best practice

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.878
Caption: everyone&#39;s doing it differently so that

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.919
Caption: should say one thing in and of itself

00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:16.080
Caption: that everyone thinks best practice or

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:18.238
Caption: what&#39;s best practice to their problem

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.339
Caption: is different

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:22.139
Caption: so what do people really mean when they

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:24.419
Caption: say best practice and I&#39;m sure some

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:26.699
Caption: people will recognize what they really

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:28.738
Caption: mean in a few of their conversations but

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:30.958
Caption: a lot of the time people are saying in

00:02:28.738 --> 00:02:33.779
Caption: conversations when they&#39;re deciding what

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:35.339
Caption: uh what solutions to go for they&#39;re

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:37.559
Caption: really just saying well this is what I

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:38.419
Caption: know so therefore this is what we should

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:40.738
Caption: do

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:42.419
Caption: or or somebody else did it this way

00:02:40.738 --> 00:02:46.378
Caption: therefore we should do it this way

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:48.839
Caption: but it doesn&#39;t really capture a lot of

00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:50.580
Caption: intricacies that we face when we deal

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:54.720
Caption: within deal with the project within a

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.220
Caption: company so what organization a did isn&#39;t

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.399
Caption: necessarily what organization B should

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.399
Caption: do

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.480
Caption: so when we talk about best practice it

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:06.238
Caption: doesn&#39;t actually give any real

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:08.039
Caption: information we&#39;re not saying that this

00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:09.539
Caption: option is better because of X Y and Z

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.639
Caption: we&#39;re simply saying it&#39;s better because

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:13.679
Caption: it&#39;s best practice and you can&#39;t really

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.199
Caption: argue with that

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:18.359
Caption: so

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:20.598
Caption: to elaborate on that a little bit

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.000
Caption: when people talk about best practice

00:03:20.598 --> 00:03:26.000
Caption: they really are using it often as a

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.979
Caption: shield in these in these conversations

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.199
Caption: so kind of going well this is what I

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.839
Caption: know therefore I&#39;ll say it&#39;s best

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.158
Caption: practice and then they can&#39;t really

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.958
Caption: argue with me because how can you argue

00:03:35.158 --> 00:03:38.878
Caption: against best practice it&#39;s best practice

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:42.319
Caption: it&#39;s why it&#39;s called best practice and

00:03:38.878 --> 00:03:42.319
Caption: that is a genuine conversation I&#39;ve had

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:48.360
Caption: so

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:51.598
Caption: people will also use this as

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.220
Caption: a way to

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:55.139
Caption: um

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.518
Caption: also is a bit of a shield when they

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.220
Caption: don&#39;t really understand what it is that

00:03:56.518 --> 00:04:01.919
Caption: they&#39;re trying to do as well so people

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.598
Caption: who for example trying to set up a data

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.119
Caption: warehouse they know they want a data

00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:08.639
Caption: warehouse they don&#39;t really know

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:10.319
Caption: what it needs to do and who it needs to

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.059
Caption: be used for so they start throwing

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.979
Caption: around things like best practice and

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.779
Caption: they&#39;ll go well we need a Kimble star

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:17.040
Caption: schema because it&#39;s best practice and

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.958
Caption: it&#39;s like is that really going to meet

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.760
Caption: our requirements is that really going to

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.100
Caption: be useful for the end users like what

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.199
Caption: are we actually trying to do

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.240
Caption: second of all it gets often used to

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.639
Caption: promote things people

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:31.918
Caption: teams organizations they often want to

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.899
Caption: say yeah I&#39;m doing best practice as

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.459
Caption: almost a badge of honor

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:37.919
Caption: to kind of say well we&#39;re doing better

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:39.959
Caption: than you but as I mentioned at the start

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.759
Caption: different organizations have different

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:43.259
Caption: problems different solutions everyone&#39;s

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.059
Caption: doing things differently

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.320
Caption: you know none they&#39;re not not

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:47.940
Caption: necessarily saying someone doing it good

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.880
Caption: some are doing it bad it&#39;s different

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.259
Caption: because the environment is different the

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.220
Caption: people are different the organization&#39;s

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.339
Caption: different the problems are different the

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.199
Caption: it infrastructure is different

00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:00.239
Caption: and finally

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.220
Caption: some people especially in the leadership

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:03.299
Caption: role will often use the term best

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.339
Caption: practice

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:06.418
Caption: to kind of Escape some of the

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.279
Caption: responsibility

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.899
Caption: so they&#39;ll go oh we need a data

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:11.579
Caption: warehouse

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:13.739
Caption: they don&#39;t want to make decisions around

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:14.698
Caption: well what are we going to implement what

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:16.019
Caption: infrastructure are we going to use

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.520
Caption: they&#39;re going to say well we&#39;re going to

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:19.019
Caption: implement best practice

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:21.539
Caption: and

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:24.599
Caption: that really just erodes some of this

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.180
Caption: that the team sort of make up you&#39;re not

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.979
Caption: listening to different ideas and it&#39;s

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:30.299
Caption: really taking away their responsibility

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.979
Caption: for the decision

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:33.839
Caption: you know if something goes wrong they go

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:37.399
Caption: well it was best practice you know it&#39;s

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:37.399
Caption: not my problem it&#39;s best practice

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.160
Caption: so

00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:43.138
Caption: what are these problems really what is

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.239
Caption: this actually causing problems with our

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.460
Caption: projects first and foremost

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:49.500
Caption: it&#39;s really ignoring different ideas

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:51.419
Caption: that are being put forward if you put

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.619
Caption: forward something a different idea

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.240
Caption: people are often shooting it down

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:56.339
Caption: because it&#39;s not best practice or they

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:58.019
Caption: don&#39;t deem it to be best practice again

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.579
Caption: I&#39;m hoping the theme Here is that

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:02.759
Caption: there&#39;s no such thing as best practice

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:04.138
Caption: but a lot of people will discount things

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.100
Caption: simply because they don&#39;t know it

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.119
Caption: therefore it&#39;s not best practice

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.820
Caption: therefore we shouldn&#39;t do it

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:14.880
Caption: with promoting it often breeds a very

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.820
Caption: toxic work culture where people&#39;s ideas

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.020
Caption: are not shared and valued it&#39;s very much

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.039
Caption: about promoting well we&#39;re doing best

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:22.319
Caption: practice therefore we&#39;re better

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.000
Caption: therefore you should listen to us and

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.399
Caption: I&#39;ve worked across many teams where this

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.259
Caption: has actually occurred

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:30.899
Caption: and finally

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:33.959
Caption: avoiding this responsibility really does

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:36.899
Caption: create a lack of leadership within the

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:40.339
Caption: the the project team and even within the

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:40.339
Caption: wider team of stakeholders

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.720
Caption: so

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:49.138
Caption: overall trying to take the concept of

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.779
Caption: best practice is really removing that

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:54.000
Caption: visibility and understanding of on the

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:56.639
Caption: ability to be able to articulate some of

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.979
Caption: these these Concepts and the reasons why

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.819
Caption: we should be doing something you know we

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.080
Caption: shouldn&#39;t be doing something because

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.880
Caption: it&#39;s best practice we should be doing

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:04.319
Caption: something because it solves a to

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.160
Caption: constraints B

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.160
Caption: for user C

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.100
Caption: so

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:14.220
Caption: the ability to articulate Solutions

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.020
Caption: does create a few bit extra benefits

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.339
Caption: that

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:19.979
Caption: you can&#39;t really get when you start

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:22.019
Caption: talking about best practice first one is

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.119
Caption: building trust you start building trust

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:25.679
Caption: with people when

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:27.720
Caption: so I take for example if you start

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:31.019
Caption: talking about best practice

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.399
Caption: um you&#39;re not really creating a a sense

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:34.379
Caption: of trust with your users you&#39;re saying

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:36.598
Caption: trust me I know what I&#39;m talking about

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.399
Caption: whereas if you explain the reasons why

00:07:36.598 --> 00:07:41.579
Caption: and you start engaging with clients and

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:44.399
Caption: users it starts to build some of this

00:07:41.579 --> 00:07:45.839
Caption: ability to generate the the trust that

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:48.299
Caption: they go okay this person does understand

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:50.039
Caption: our problems this person does kind of

00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:52.519
Caption: understand our Solutions maybe I should

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:52.519
Caption: listen to him

00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:58.019
Caption: secondly it generates buy-in so

00:07:56.459 --> 00:08:00.179
Caption: going that extra step further than

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:01.440
Caption: explaining why we&#39;re doing something

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:03.779
Caption: rather than just using the term best

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.279
Caption: practice we start generating buy-in from

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:06.660
Caption: different stakeholders

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:08.039
Caption: different users people within the

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.559
Caption: project group because they understand

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:11.639
Caption: why

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:13.679
Caption: especially from a junior perspective

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:15.240
Caption: with Junior people coming in if we say

00:08:13.679 --> 00:08:16.799
Caption: you&#39;re doing that simply because it&#39;s

00:08:15.239 --> 00:08:18.779
Caption: best practice they&#39;re not learning

00:08:16.799 --> 00:08:20.819
Caption: they&#39;re not understanding why they&#39;re

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:23.220
Caption: not going that one step further to say

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:24.660
Caption: well what is it that we&#39;re you know

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.279
Caption: trying to achieve and what are our

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.139
Caption: constraints what are what are some of

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:30.239
Caption: these these issues that we need to work

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:33.119
Caption: through

00:08:30.239 --> 00:08:34.679
Caption: and finally we create a shared Vision so

00:08:33.119 --> 00:08:36.718
Caption: when people if we do come across a

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:38.520
Caption: problem people can go look I know what

00:08:36.718 --> 00:08:40.500
Caption: we&#39;re trying to do let me find a

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.440
Caption: solution to that and so they&#39;ve got a

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.539
Caption: better understanding as to what

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.799
Caption: they&#39;re looking for they can go that one

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:49.199
Caption: step further they can use their

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:52.518
Caption: initiative because they&#39;re bought on

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.518
Caption: board as to the reasons why

00:08:52.859 --> 00:08:56.059
Caption: so how do we achieve this

00:08:56.278 --> 00:08:59.099
Caption: firstly we understand the problem and I

00:08:58.018 --> 00:09:00.599
Caption: know this is going to stand very very

00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:03.239
Caption: basic for a lot of you but we understand

00:09:00.599 --> 00:09:05.759
Caption: the problem so starting from that

00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:07.559
Caption: problem first

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.059
Caption: we then start to organize some of these

00:09:07.559 --> 00:09:11.159
Caption: organizational priorities so

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:13.260
Caption: understanding not only what the problem

00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:15.500
Caption: is but why it&#39;s a problem and what

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.820
Caption: they&#39;re trying to achieve from it

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:20.278
Caption: understanding constraints so these can

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.660
Caption: be anything from cost to to the politics

00:09:20.278 --> 00:09:23.099
Caption: again

00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:25.440
Caption: going into an organization as a

00:09:23.099 --> 00:09:28.199
Caption: consultant a lot of the times we

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.898
Caption: we have to navigate things like politics

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.760
Caption: we have to navigate their environments

00:09:30.898 --> 00:09:34.320
Caption: we need to navigate various different

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.080
Caption: things like even the people some people

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.640
Caption: you know all those those personalities

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.898
Caption: that you need to navigate and when we

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.278
Caption: start throwing in best practice you&#39;re

00:09:39.898 --> 00:09:44.778
Caption: basically just creating a Barren going

00:09:41.278 --> 00:09:44.778
Caption: trust me I know what I&#39;m talking about

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.140
Caption: um then exploring the options so once

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:52.079
Caption: you understand what it is we&#39;re trying

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:54.059
Caption: to achieve and putting that towards then

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.860
Caption: coming up with the different options now

00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:56.940
Caption: these you could go through and say best

00:09:55.859 --> 00:09:58.859
Caption: practice

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.838
Caption: Etc but not using the term best practice

00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:02.278
Caption: going cool we can solve this and this is

00:10:00.838 --> 00:10:04.799
Caption: a good option to go for because it meets

00:10:02.278 --> 00:10:06.838
Caption: our constraints it meets our problem it

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:10.080
Caption: meets our goals and suddenly that&#39;s a

00:10:06.838 --> 00:10:13.440
Caption: much more powerful story

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:16.200
Caption: um and then as a team deciding what

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.659
Caption: solution to go for

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.859
Caption: um and so this is then taking it from a

00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:20.940
Caption: solution-driven approach where we&#39;re

00:10:19.859 --> 00:10:22.859
Caption: going all right let&#39;s find best practice

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.940
Caption: and Implement that to okay what are we

00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:24.958
Caption: trying to solve cool we&#39;re going to

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.278
Caption: implement something that&#39;s solving that

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.440
Caption: problem

00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:30.778
Caption: so to kind of quickly sum up because

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.859
Caption: I&#39;ve been given the one minute warning

00:10:30.778 --> 00:10:34.260
Caption: um

00:10:31.859 --> 00:10:35.940
Caption: it&#39;s not about changing an entire way of

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.338
Caption: working but just changing our mindsets

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.559
Caption: to ban the term and I ban the term best

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:41.700
Caption: practice from all of my teams if my

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:43.380
Caption: teams are coming up to me talking about

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.700
Caption: problems and they use the term best

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.440
Caption: practice I tell them to go away and come

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.359
Caption: back to me when they&#39;ve actually

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.159
Caption: done that research and gone come back

00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:51.778
Caption: with an actual plan

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:54.719
Caption: um and so it just start with just

00:10:51.778 --> 00:10:56.640
Caption: Banning those two terms best practice

00:10:54.719 --> 00:10:58.589
Caption: thank you very much there&#39;s my

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:06.729
Caption: references and thanks to the sponsors

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:06.729
Caption: [Applause]
