  "description": "AWS CDK has revolutionised the developer experience and significantly improves productivity when deploying AWS resources compared to writing CloudFormation YAML. CDK allows developers to model application infrastructure using familiar programming languages, IDE\u2019s, testing tools, and workflow patterns. I was very relieved to learn the same is possible for Kubernetes using CDK8s and I never need to write another YAML manifest ever again.\\n\\nI\u2019ll show how CDK8s can be combined with CDK to spin up an AWS EKS cluster, generate Kubernetes manifests and apply them to the cluster without the headaches of writing any YAML.\\n\\n--\\nCameron is currently working in a DevOps Engineer role at INX Software. Before learning about Software Development Cameron was an Accountant where he quickly outgrew spreadsheets and exposure to business improvement methodologies like LEAN Six Sigma lead to a passion for DevOps."
