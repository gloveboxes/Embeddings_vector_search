  "description": "Event sourcing is popular for many reasons, but it\u2019s easy to rack up databases of millions, hundreds of millions, sometimes billions of events. Turning these events into useful read models requires lots of processing, but what if we can\u2019t afford to wait a day?\\n\\nLet\u2019s go on a journey into building high performance read models from the simple to the downright silly. Let\u2019s see how fast we can process 1 billion events.\\n\\n--\\nChris Bellew is a developer and technical speaker from Perth. He\u0027s worked in tech companies of all sizes and has experience in web development and machine learning."
