Starting off at whispers, we\u2019re now starting to hear it as a deafening roar as more and more developers write about it, talk about it, share it and start using it. In the world of front end, I see it everywhere I turn and am excited as I start to use it in my own projects.\\n\\nBut what does this new CSS specification mean for software developers, and why should you care about it? In the world of tech today, we can do so many amazing things and use whatever language we choose across a wide range of devices and platforms. Whether it\u2019s the advent of React and React Native, or frameworks like Electron, it\u2019s easier than ever to build one app that works on multiple platforms with the language we know and work with best. The ability to do this also expands to styling apps on any platform using CSS, and therefore being able to utilise the magical thing that is\\nCSS Grid.\\n\\nThe reason CSS Grid is gaining so much attention, is because it\u2019s a game changer for front end and layouts. With a few simple lines of code, we can now create imaginative, dynamic, responsive layouts (yep, I know that\u2019s a lot of buzz words). While a lot of people are calling this the new \u2018table layout\u2019, grid gives us so much more, with the ability to spread cells across columns and rows to whatever size you choose, dictate which direction new items flow, allow cells to move around to fit in place and even tell certain cells exactly where they need to sit.\\n\\nWhile there is so much to worry about when developing an app, CSS Grid means that you can worry less about building the layout on the front end, and more about making sure the back end works well. Let me show you how the magic works.\\n\\nAmy is a freelance developer, starting her own business, working with other freelancers and learning everything she can about the web. She\u2019s been a freelancer on the side for 4 years, and most recently worked at an agency in Subiaco.\\nAmy also spends her time helping out as a co-organiser for Fenders (a community group of front-end developers in Perth), other community events (such as the JuniorDev Meetup and Perth Web Girls) and works as an evangelist for YOW! Conference. She blogs in her spare time (about tech, the web and life), and volunteers as a reviewer for the Fringe World Festival in Perth."
