Caption: much to our amazing sponsors

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.699
Caption: and today I&#39;m here to talk to you about

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:26.639
Caption: ducks which was originally titled being

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:28.798
Caption: a more sustainable you but I feel the

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:29.639
Caption: Ducks part is the most important part of

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.520
Caption: it

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:35.459
Caption: so when I first wrote this talk I was

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:37.319
Caption: talking about being more sustainable but

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:39.438
Caption: rather than the you know get rid of

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.658
Caption: plastic straws and containers

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:47.159
Caption: environmental kind of sustainability I

00:01:42.658 --> 00:01:49.500
Caption: looked at our own sustainability and had

00:01:47.158 --> 00:01:52.578
Caption: a look at the things that I learned over

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.500
Caption: the years the mistakes that I&#39;ve made

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:00.600
Caption: the mistakes that I&#39;ve kept making

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.500
Caption: and thought I&#39;d put together a bit of a

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:05.879
Caption: presentation to share what I&#39;ve learned

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.259
Caption: so

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:10.380
Caption: usually

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.279
Caption: when things are busy like when I&#39;m

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.559
Caption: running a conference I also don&#39;t listen

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:18.238
Caption: to my own advice as well so if you feel

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:20.399
Caption: like I sound like I know what I&#39;m

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:22.378
Caption: talking about I&#39;m still learning just as

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:26.098
Caption: much as the rest of you

00:02:22.378 --> 00:02:28.259

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.779
Caption: have left I love taking part in the

Caption: Perth Community I&#39;m an organizer for the

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:54.238

Caption: DDD Perth if you&#39;ve heard of it

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.040
Caption: now

00:03:01.738 --> 00:03:06.979
Caption: as you could probably imagine

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:10.619
Caption: or if you saw me this morning actually

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:13.378
Caption: witnessed in person I&#39;m often busy I&#39;m

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:16.440
Caption: often juggling multiple things and I&#39;m

00:03:13.378 --> 00:03:18.658
Caption: often overloaded usually my fault and

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.979
Caption: therefore stressed because of it but

00:03:18.658 --> 00:03:22.919
Caption: there are things that I&#39;ve learned

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:25.259
Caption: things that I can help do to make it

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.878
Caption: easier and to manage my mental health so

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:29.458
Caption: that I don&#39;t burn out

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:30.839
Caption: as I said I often don&#39;t learn from my

00:03:29.458 --> 00:03:33.539
Caption: mistakes

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:36.419
Caption: and I&#39;ll often end up making the same

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:39.238
Caption: mistakes over and over even though I

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:42.199
Caption: know better so don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve got

00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:42.199
Caption: a secret that you don&#39;t

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:49.018
Caption: now first off I want to talk about

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:52.139
Caption: burnout

00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:54.539
Caption: it&#39;s a word that we hear a lot of in the

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:57.059
Caption: industry a few years ago I went through

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:59.579
Caption: a bit of a month I started a new job I

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:02.518
Caption: interviewed and hired a bunch of staff I

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.119
Caption: trained staff I started a new degree all

00:04:02.518 --> 00:04:09.298
Caption: while trying to replace my car after I

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:10.979
Caption: had just been physically assaulted and I

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:14.339
Caption: was looking for and moving into a new

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:17.940
Caption: rental property oh it was also my

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:22.260
Caption: birthday and I was planning two parties

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:26.040
Caption: so oddly enough at the end of all this

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.900
Caption: I burnt out but I didn&#39;t understand that

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.279
Caption: I&#39;d burnt out I didn&#39;t learn and I

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:31.799
Caption: didn&#39;t actually take time to have a

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:34.259
Caption: break for myself so although I recovered

00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:36.299
Caption: it took me a really long time to get

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.119
Caption: there

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:42.478
Caption: several years after this I was working

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:44.399
Caption: at a digital agency working 60 to 70

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.860
Caption: hour weeks

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:49.079
Caption: I was having trouble sleeping I got to

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:54.179
Caption: the point where I was constantly dizzy

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:56.459
Caption: and nauseous and I recognized that I&#39;d

00:04:54.179 --> 00:05:00.600
Caption: experienced these symptoms before

00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:02.279
Caption: thankfully since then I had been to a

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.380
Caption: local Meetup that talked about mental

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:07.679
Caption: health and I realized I was experiencing

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.619
Caption: burnout and this time I decided to

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:13.259
Caption: actually do something about it so I went

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:15.779
Caption: to my local GP I got a referral to see a

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.699
Caption: psychologist and my GP made me take a

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:21.059
Caption: week off work

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:23.220
Caption: while I had my week off work I got a

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:25.320
Caption: phone call from my boss who said look I

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.799
Caption: know you&#39;re off sick can you come in

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.660
Caption: anyway and have a chat

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:32.899
Caption: this is clearly going to be a promotion

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.899
Caption: right

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:38.459
Caption: I got made redundant with a week&#39;s

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:42.179
Caption: notice at a time when no was was hiring

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:43.638
Caption: for my role right before Christmas

00:05:42.179 --> 00:05:46.199
Caption: the next day

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.839
Caption: I had a meeting with the psychologist

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.880
Caption: I&#39;d been referred to and because he had

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:54.419
Caption: the referral he said you&#39;re here for

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.940
Caption: work stress how&#39;s that going

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.820
Caption: and I laughed

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.979
Caption: I had no job

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.179
Caption: wasn&#39;t entirely sure how I was going to

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.479
Caption: pay my rent

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:10.199
Caption: and yet somehow I felt better than I had

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.199
Caption: in months

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:17.399
Caption: now I&#39;m a bit of a worrier so this

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:18.779
Caption: situation where I didn&#39;t have a job and

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:21.479
Caption: I didn&#39;t really know what I was going to

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:25.500
Caption: do really should have been more

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:28.739
Caption: concerning but although I was worried

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.940
Caption: I&#39;d realized that there is actually a

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:33.119
Caption: different there&#39;s different kinds of

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.399
Caption: worry there&#39;s good worry

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:37.979
Caption: and bad worry

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:40.199
Caption: now the good worry is worry that is

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.959
Caption: useful this is worry that you can

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:46.319
Caption: actually do something about so in my

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:49.859
Caption: situation it&#39;s worry where I can apply

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:52.619
Caption: for jobs and pick up some extra work and

00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:54.659
Caption: maybe stop over eating dinner every

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:56.819
Caption: night and

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:59.279
Caption: steal somebody else&#39;s Netflix password

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:01.319
Caption: there were things that I could do to

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:04.679
Caption: make the situation better

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:06.539
Caption: from there there wasn&#39;t anything that I

00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:09.119
Caption: was able to do to make the situation

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:11.160
Caption: better the worry wasn&#39;t useful and it

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:14.819
Caption: was turning into bad worry

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.940
Caption: so I taught myself well I attempted to

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:19.859
Caption: teach myself to stop the worry when it&#39;s

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.598
Caption: not useful

00:07:19.859 --> 00:07:24.239
Caption: once again

00:07:21.598 --> 00:07:27.000
Caption: this isn&#39;t something that I can just do

00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:29.039
Caption: I don&#39;t have a switch that says okay the

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.859
Caption: good worry is done I&#39;m gonna stop

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:34.019
Caption: worrying now if anyone happens to manage

00:07:31.859 --> 00:07:36.899
Caption: to do that that would be great if you

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:39.720
Caption: could let us know the secret

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:42.899
Caption: but there is often things that you can

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.940
Caption: do when you when you find yourself

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:46.440
Caption: starting to worry so work out whether is

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.860
Caption: there anything you can do to change the

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.059
Caption: situation or is this not used for

00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:53.098
Caption: worrying

00:07:51.059 --> 00:07:56.339
Caption: this has been really useful when I gave

00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:59.339
Caption: my first conference talk oddly enough I

00:07:56.339 --> 00:08:01.440
Caption: was a little bit worried so I practiced

00:07:59.339 --> 00:08:03.779
Caption: I prepared I thought of absolutely

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.899
Caption: everything that could possibly go wrong

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:10.619
Caption: and I worked out what I could do in each

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:13.319
Caption: situation I worried and then I worked

00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:16.079
Caption: out how I could combat my worries

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:18.059
Caption: after I had done everything I could do

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:19.978
Caption: there wasn&#39;t anything I could do to make

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:21.000
Caption: it better so there was no point me

00:08:19.979 --> 00:08:24.779
Caption: worrying

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.239
Caption: once again this isn&#39;t a switch that I

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:29.759
Caption: can turn off

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:33.778
Caption: I thankfully at that point in time the

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:35.760
Caption: worry was able to the worry helped me to

00:08:33.778 --> 00:08:38.398
Caption: give a really good talk I was prepared

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:42.179
Caption: for the fact that there were AV issues

00:08:38.398 --> 00:08:44.519
Caption: and a bunch of things didn&#39;t work but

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:48.778
Caption: there&#39;s still a whole lot of worry that

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.778
Caption: I didn&#39;t need to have afterwards

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:55.140
Caption: and if you think

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:58.080
Caption: that I&#39;ve clearly learned by now to just

00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.660
Caption: stop the worrying I invite you to

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.100
Caption: organize a conference

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:04.319
Caption: when there&#39;s a lot of things to worry

00:09:02.099 --> 00:09:06.479
Caption: about so if anyone thinks that I&#39;ve

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.640
Caption: managed to nail this whole you know not

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:11.820
Caption: worrying thing

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.760
Caption: try finding a backup speaker two hours

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.320
Caption: before a session starts in case anyone

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:20.100
Caption: didn&#39;t catch some of our last minute

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.320
Caption: agenda changes after we announced that

00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:24.739
Caption: there had been last minute agenda

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.739
Caption: changes

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:31.559
Caption: next I want to talk about being

00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:34.440
Caption: productive has anyone here spent a

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:37.018
Caption: weekend where you get to the end of

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:40.640
Caption: Sunday and you kind of feel like you&#39;ve

00:09:37.018 --> 00:09:40.639
Caption: absolutely done nothing at all

00:09:42.119 --> 00:09:47.239
Caption: who here feels bad because they&#39;ve done

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.239
Caption: nothing at all

00:09:47.458 --> 00:09:52.380
Caption: cool I&#39;ve done that

00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:55.320
Caption: have you ever realized that generally

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.760
Caption: when you&#39;ve had these weekends it&#39;s

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.320
Caption: usually after you&#39;ve had a really

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.359
Caption: full-on week

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.859
Caption: and you&#39;re a bit naked

00:10:00.359 --> 00:10:03.859
Caption: and you kind of need the break

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:10.919
Caption: so I reframed

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:13.500
Caption: my thinking instead of

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:16.739
Caption: I wasn&#39;t productive I just watched

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:20.159
Caption: Netflix for two days it was actually

00:10:16.739 --> 00:10:22.919
Caption: I&#39;ve been really tired I&#39;ve been really

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:26.278
Caption: worn out I need the break and my body

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:28.380
Caption: needs a chance to recharge

00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:31.260
Caption: so I made sure that I was actually

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.820
Caption: finding the time to prioritize me and

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:37.880
Caption: stopped feeling

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:40.320
Caption: like I was lazy or unproductive instead

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.599
Caption: prioritizing me and giving me the chance

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.559
Caption: to recharge was something that I

00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:45.559
Caption: actually had to do

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:53.039
Caption: now this went a step further after I

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:55.979
Caption: then saw a Meetup event where someone

00:10:53.039 --> 00:10:58.199
Caption: talked about time boxing and the speaker

00:10:55.979 --> 00:11:01.919
Caption: actually talked about how they time

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:04.380
Caption: boxed their own personal time these are

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:06.359
Caption: calendar events that cannot be moved

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.838
Caption: they cannot be overwritten and this is

00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:13.440
Caption: time that is set aside

00:11:08.838 --> 00:11:16.320
Caption: for me this is me time

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.659
Caption: by making sure that I have a conscious

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.078
Caption: maker conscious effort I don&#39;t feel like

00:11:18.659 --> 00:11:24.659
Caption: I&#39;m being unproductive anymore and I&#39;m

00:11:22.078 --> 00:11:28.139
Caption: able to look after myself a bit better

00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:30.179
Caption: now this doesn&#39;t have to be you know an

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:32.100
Caption: hour blocked out it could be five

00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:34.859
Caption: minutes before you go to bed to read a

00:11:32.099 --> 00:11:38.099
Caption: book and have a cup of tea work out what

00:11:34.859 --> 00:11:40.200
Caption: it is that helps you recharge and find

00:11:38.099 --> 00:11:45.179
Caption: the time for it

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:48.480
Caption: I like to think of our energy in terms

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:49.979
Caption: of the Zelda stamina bar if anybody is

00:11:48.479 --> 00:11:53.099
Caption: familiar

00:11:49.979 --> 00:11:55.320
Caption: as long as you don&#39;t reach the end if

00:11:53.099 --> 00:11:57.000
Caption: you keep resting it comes back fairly

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.039
Caption: quickly so as long as you take short

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.679
Caption: regular breaks it doesn&#39;t take long to

00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:05.398
Caption: recharge but

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:08.219
Caption: if you go all the way to the end and run

00:12:05.398 --> 00:12:11.099
Caption: out of stamina it takes a really long

00:12:08.219 --> 00:12:12.599
Caption: time before you can get back into the

00:12:11.099 --> 00:12:15.239
Caption: swing of things

00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:18.838
Caption: now this might be something different

00:12:15.239 --> 00:12:22.380
Caption: for each of you it might be some time

00:12:18.838 --> 00:12:25.320
Caption: alone if you&#39;re an extrovert you might

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:28.078
Caption: like to have some time with friends if

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.179
Caption: you&#39;re very special like me it might be

00:12:28.078 --> 00:12:33.179
Caption: spending time at a conference with a

00:12:30.179 --> 00:12:36.179
Caption: thousand other people so find what helps

00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:38.940
Caption: you recharge and schedule that in

00:12:36.179 --> 00:12:41.640
Caption: this will also change as well I talked

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.500
Caption: about how I like to travel so it&#39;s a

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.119
Caption: little bit tricky for me to sit down and

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.380
Caption: have a cup of tea and read a book when

00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:49.138
Caption: I&#39;m spending a lot of time at

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.599
Caption: conferences so I&#39;ve worked out my own

00:12:49.138 --> 00:12:54.539
Caption: ways that I can recharge when I&#39;m on the

00:12:51.599 --> 00:12:57.838
Caption: road whether that&#39;s oddly enough staying

00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:59.880
Caption: up until 3am catching up with friends or

00:12:57.838 --> 00:13:02.820
Caption: watching a trashy movie on the plane

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:06.078
Caption: working out what helps me recharge

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.078
Caption: wherever I am

00:13:06.979 --> 00:13:12.838
Caption: boundaries are a word that we love and

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.239
Caption: hate

00:13:12.838 --> 00:13:17.820
Caption: when I first started my business I

00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:20.578
Caption: prided myself on the fact that wherever

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:23.578
Caption: I was at whatever time my clients could

00:13:20.578 --> 00:13:26.518
Caption: call me and I could help them out

00:13:23.578 --> 00:13:29.940
Caption: but as my business grew I discovered

00:13:26.518 --> 00:13:32.039
Caption: that this isn&#39;t super scalable

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:36.000
Caption: I mean it&#39;s okay when I have one or two

00:13:32.039 --> 00:13:37.739
Caption: clients but when I have 20 I was

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.719
Caption: constantly contact switching between

00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:42.659
Caption: phone calls and emails and actually

00:13:39.719 --> 00:13:45.239
Caption: getting the work done I wasn&#39;t getting

00:13:42.659 --> 00:13:47.359
Caption: anything done but I saw at a meet-up

00:13:45.239 --> 00:13:49.619
Caption: event they talked about

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:52.078
Caption: employee the employer employee

00:13:49.619 --> 00:13:55.018
Caption: relationship the same as we think of

00:13:52.078 --> 00:13:56.880
Caption: romantic or personal relationships

00:13:55.018 --> 00:14:01.458
Caption: and so I had to think

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:03.838
Caption: if you have a friend or a partner who&#39;s

00:14:01.458 --> 00:14:06.659
Caption: constantly calling you day and night

00:14:03.838 --> 00:14:10.260
Caption: even when you say you can&#39;t talk

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:13.199
Caption: who keeps hassling you and won&#39;t leave

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:15.958
Caption: you alone and doesn&#39;t like you spending

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:19.639
Caption: time with your other friends does this

00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:19.638
Caption: sound like a healthy relationship

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.898
Caption: not really

00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:31.078
Caption: so I implemented boundaries

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.299
Caption: I let my clients know

00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:35.820
Caption: that I would only be taking phone calls

00:14:33.299 --> 00:14:39.059
Caption: if it was urgent I let them know I would

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:41.220
Caption: be answering emails twice a day and for

00:14:39.059 --> 00:14:43.500
Caption: the most part my clients respected this

00:14:41.219 --> 00:14:45.299
Caption: choice they followed the boundaries that

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.638
Caption: I had sat and the working relationship

00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:50.820
Caption: continued well

00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:52.919
Caption: the other clients

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.138
Caption: is not to say they didn&#39;t

00:14:52.919 --> 00:14:56.820
Caption: agree to the boundaries because they

00:14:55.138 --> 00:14:59.398
Caption: never said they didn&#39;t like them they

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:01.739
Caption: just ignored them completely

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:04.440
Caption: kept doing the exact same thing to the

00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:08.458
Caption: point that one of them asked me to come

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:11.838
Caption: in and work at 8 pm on a Monday night in

00:15:08.458 --> 00:15:11.838
Caption: exchange for beer

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.138
Caption: I don&#39;t drink beer

00:15:15.239 --> 00:15:18.559
Caption: beer doesn&#39;t pay my rent

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:23.578
Caption: and I know it&#39;s a Monday night but I&#39;ve

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.039
Caption: got better things to do so oddly enough

00:15:23.578 --> 00:15:28.799
Caption: they&#39;re not clients anymore

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:31.320
Caption: as I expanded I was then able to be a

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:33.599
Caption: little bit pickier and apply these

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.799
Caption: boundaries and these choices to Future

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:36.719
Caption: clients

00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:38.578
Caption: a friend wrote a really amazing

00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:40.799
Caption: flowchart which I know you can&#39;t

00:15:38.578 --> 00:15:42.179
Caption: properly read on the screen but if

00:15:40.799 --> 00:15:45.539
Caption: anyone wants it I can share it

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:47.698
Caption: afterwards and I was able to step

00:15:45.539 --> 00:15:50.338
Caption: through each decision and actually work

00:15:47.698 --> 00:15:51.898
Caption: out whether or not I wanted this work is

00:15:50.338 --> 00:15:54.539
Caption: this client going to be a pain to deal

00:15:51.898 --> 00:15:57.859
Caption: with should I actually do this are they

00:15:54.539 --> 00:15:57.859
Caption: going to object to my boundaries

00:15:58.979 --> 00:16:04.018
Caption: the last lesson

00:16:00.778 --> 00:16:06.239
Caption: and my favorite lesson of all is I read

00:16:04.018 --> 00:16:09.838
Caption: a book that we&#39;ve probably seen in

00:16:06.239 --> 00:16:14.518
Caption: airport bookstores quite a few times

00:16:09.838 --> 00:16:16.919
Caption: at least not a lot of not giving it an F

00:16:14.518 --> 00:16:18.719
Caption: and while we talked about a lot of

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:20.940
Caption: obvious stuff it did make some really

00:16:18.719 --> 00:16:23.458
Caption: good points including I liked one of the

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:26.638
Caption: points which was whether you realize it

00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:30.739
Caption: or not you&#39;re always choosing

00:16:26.638 --> 00:16:30.739
Caption: what to give a about

00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:35.479
Caption: and so I started thinking

00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:41.599
Caption: about how I allocate

00:16:38.758 --> 00:16:41.599
Caption: my ducks

00:16:41.758 --> 00:16:46.258
Caption: there might be a situation

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:50.278
Caption: that

00:16:46.258 --> 00:16:52.799
Caption: you care a moderate level about

00:16:50.278 --> 00:16:55.679
Caption: like maybe what computer your employer

00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:58.559
Caption: buys you or what lunch option you have

00:16:55.679 --> 00:17:00.778
Caption: at DDD you might choose to give this

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:03.239
Caption: situation three ducks

00:17:00.778 --> 00:17:04.318
Caption: 10 Ducks per situation give this three

00:17:03.239 --> 00:17:07.260
Caption: ducks

00:17:04.318 --> 00:17:08.880
Caption: maybe there&#39;s something that you care

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.520
Caption: about

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.280
Caption: a lot more like

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:17.338
Caption: whether you get a ticket to DDD

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:19.500
Caption: you might give that situation nine Ducks

00:17:17.338 --> 00:17:22.500
Caption: nine out of ten Ducks that&#39;s pretty

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:25.380
Caption: important situation

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.000
Caption: maybe there&#39;s a decision that you just

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.859
Caption: don&#39;t really care about the outcome as

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.280
Caption: much

00:17:28.859 --> 00:17:34.459
Caption: you just have no ducks left to give it

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.460
Caption: all

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.859
Caption: so I started thinking about how I&#39;m

00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:44.038
Caption: allocating my ducks

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:48.058
Caption: am I giving too many ducks

00:17:44.038 --> 00:17:52.079
Caption: am I giving two little ducks am I giving

00:17:48.058 --> 00:17:55.439
Caption: ducks in places that I shouldn&#39;t or to

00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:58.739
Caption: people who don&#39;t deserve them

00:17:55.439 --> 00:18:01.139
Caption: because we need to be careful about how

00:17:58.739 --> 00:18:04.558
Caption: we&#39;re allocating our ducks if you give

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:08.099

00:18:04.558 --> 00:18:10.678

00:18:10.678 --> 00:18:16.918

00:18:12.719 --> 00:18:18.959
Caption: with no ducks left to give at all

00:18:16.918 --> 00:18:22.678

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:31.520
Caption: to give and nothing left to give them on

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.900

00:18:34.918 --> 00:18:39.959
Caption: I want to come back to sustainability

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:42.719

00:18:39.959 --> 00:18:45.418

00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:01.919

00:18:58.439 --> 00:19:05.699
Caption: being sustainable with yourself

00:19:01.918 --> 00:19:08.339

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.820
