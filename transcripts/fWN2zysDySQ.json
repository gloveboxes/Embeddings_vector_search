  "description": "After spending time in over 25 different workplaces, I\u0027ve seen examples of high-performing teams, and those that are totally stifled by their environment.\\n\\nI\u0027ve spent time trying to distill what made each of those places tick and extracted common problems. For each of those problems, I use examples to explain their effect on the team, and the solutions I\u0027ve seen work to mitigate them. We\u0027ll cover topics like security theatre, tech strategy and team setup amongst others. \\n\\nBy the end of it you\u0027ll come away with a few tools to take back to your organisation to help your teams get stuff done and hopefully make some customers happy along the way."
