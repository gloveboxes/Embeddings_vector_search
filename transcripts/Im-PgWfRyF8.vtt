00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:54.058
Caption: passion for drawing okay it&#39;s more like

00:13:47.638 --> 00:13:56.299
Caption: this and I started out I was inspired by

00:13:54.059 --> 00:13:59.819
Caption: a guy who wrote a book called

00:13:56.299 --> 00:14:03.628
Caption: show-and-tell and I started by drawing

00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:05.938
Caption: crude stick figures lines and arrows and

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:09.149
Caption: shapes and that was it I mean these were

00:14:05.939 --> 00:14:11.639
Caption: these were craptastic drawings but I had

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:14.308
Caption: so much fun doing it and became you know

00:14:11.638 --> 00:14:19.078
Caption: a hobby of mine I I didn&#39;t want to stop

00:14:14.309 --> 00:14:21.300
Caption: and about three years ago I drew this

00:14:19.078 --> 00:14:23.369

00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:29.518

00:14:29.518 --> 00:14:35.758
Caption: proud of this drawing it took me a long

00:14:32.099 --> 00:14:38.369
Caption: time to do it I made a lot of mistakes

00:14:35.758 --> 00:14:41.549
Caption: and go back in a race and draw things

00:14:38.369 --> 00:14:43.948
Caption: again but it had the effect that I

00:14:41.549 --> 00:14:46.438
Caption: wanted and people would chuckle and they

00:14:43.948 --> 00:14:49.128
Caption: they enjoyed it and I would show this

00:14:46.439 --> 00:14:52.230
Caption: any time I was about to give a a demo

00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:54.720

00:15:18.258 --> 00:15:25.588
Caption: puff myself in up anyway or whatever I

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:27.570

00:15:25.588 --> 00:15:30.479
Caption: get as far as I&#39;ve come

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:35.669
Caption: continuing to get better and I had this

00:15:30.479 --> 00:15:39.419
Caption: aha moment well duh I&#39;ve been investing

00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:47.479
Caption: realized that just like learning a new

00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:50.129

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:56.849

Caption: that spark that desire that passion for

00:16:08.338 --> 00:16:18.599
Caption: pursuing something the the gift really

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:20.849
Caption: is every day that we&#39;re given we have

00:16:18.599 --> 00:16:23.130
Caption: another opportunity to choose how we

00:16:20.849 --> 00:16:26.278

Caption: willing to put into following that dream

00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:41.309

Caption: it is that you want to do or want to get

00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:48.719

00:16:48.719 --> 00:16:53.429

00:16:51.539 --> 00:16:56.369

Caption: patience some patience with yourself

00:16:56.369 --> 00:17:05.010
Caption: because making slow incremental uh you

00:17:00.778 --> 00:17:06.568

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:09.928
Caption: like you&#39;re not making any progress at

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:12.958

00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.750
Caption: come

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.188
Caption: you know this about writing code right

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:20.159
Caption: you look back on something that you

00:17:17.188 --> 00:17:25.619
Caption: wrote six months ago or a year ago and

00:17:20.159 --> 00:17:28.230

00:17:38.459 --> 00:17:45.089
Caption: story that resonates in us

00:17:41.099 --> 00:17:47.939
Caption: often times the hero doesn&#39;t realize

00:17:45.089 --> 00:17:50.909
Caption: what they&#39;re capable of or until someone

00:17:47.939 --> 00:17:53.219
Caption: or something you know fantastic comes

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.950
Caption: along that kind of inspires them or or

00:17:53.219 --> 00:18:00.030

00:23:50.839 --> 00:23:55.989
Caption: bit more like one of those kinds of

00:23:52.428 --> 00:24:02.569
Caption: people that&#39;s always encouraging and

00:23:55.989 --> 00:24:05.589
Caption: helping others to be more awesome here&#39;s

00:24:02.569 --> 00:24:05.589
Caption: one of my favorite quotes

00:24:09.959 --> 00:24:18.808
Caption: when I gave my first talk people didn&#39;t

00:24:15.308 --> 00:24:24.339

00:24:18.808 --> 00:24:26.469
Caption: demo failure I you know the they didn&#39;t

00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:27.999
Caption: remember maybe even the technology or

00:24:26.469 --> 00:24:32.199
Caption: whatever it was that I was speaking

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:35.889
Caption: about but in they remember me and that

00:24:32.199 --> 00:24:42.488
Caption: in some small way I helped them with

00:24:35.889 --> 00:24:45.159
Caption: their their life or their career in 2016

00:24:42.489 --> 00:24:47.499

00:24:47.499 --> 00:24:53.200
Caption: Tennessee which is where I used to live

00:24:49.719 --> 00:24:55.689
Caption: and I had more than one person come up

00:24:53.199 --> 00:24:57.939
Caption: to me that you know I told the same

00:24:55.689 --> 00:25:01.178
Caption: story about how I got started and how I

00:24:57.939 --> 00:25:03.908
Caption: was terrible at my first talk and I had

00:25:01.178 --> 00:25:07.239
Caption: people coming up to me afterwards to say

00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:09.580
Caption: I was there I remember when you gave

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:18.279
Caption: your first talk and you&#39;re right you

00:25:09.579 --> 00:25:20.678
Caption: were terrible Thanks now you may be

00:25:18.279 --> 00:25:23.200
Caption: thinking well I understand being asked

00:25:20.678 --> 00:25:27.878
Caption: or forced to speak but why would I why

00:25:23.199 --> 00:25:29.558
Caption: would I have volunteer to speak when

00:25:27.879 --> 00:25:34.210
Caption: that&#39;s like the worst thing you could

00:25:29.558 --> 00:25:38.498
Caption: possibly ask me to do it&#39;s terrifying

00:25:34.209 --> 00:25:43.298
Caption: and it is but let me tell you having

00:25:38.499 --> 00:25:45.519
Caption: someone not only understand that message

00:25:43.298 --> 00:25:48.849
Caption: that you&#39;re trying to communicate but

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:52.090
Caption: then be inspired to go and do that thing

00:25:48.849 --> 00:25:54.518
Caption: that you&#39;re talking about and do things

00:25:52.089 --> 00:25:56.469
Caption: that you&#39;ve not even imagined could be

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:58.480
Caption: done with that that thing that you&#39;re

00:25:56.469 --> 00:26:02.249
Caption: talking about that&#39;s one of the most

00:25:58.479 --> 00:26:06.158
Caption: rare and precious rewards I have ever

00:26:02.249 --> 00:26:09.940
Caption: experienced and public speaking is an

00:26:06.159 --> 00:26:11.739
Caption: amazing skill that you can learn to

00:26:09.939 --> 00:26:15.069
Caption: share your awesomeness with others and

00:26:11.739 --> 00:26:17.139
Caption: it can open doors and opportunities and

00:26:15.069 --> 00:26:20.349
Caption: launch you ahead as a leader in your

00:26:17.139 --> 00:26:21.270

00:26:20.349 --> 00:26:24.729
Caption: organization

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:27.729
Caption: the truth is public speaking is just one

00:26:24.729 --> 00:26:33.270
Caption: example there are so many ways that you

00:26:27.729 --> 00:26:33.270
Caption: can share your awesomeness with others

00:26:43.199 --> 00:26:47.709
Caption: there&#39;s this thing called impostor

00:26:45.339 --> 00:26:49.750
Caption: syndrome though that creeps up I believe

00:26:47.709 --> 00:26:52.270
Caption: it&#39;s one of the biggest reasons why

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:54.790
Caption: people more people don&#39;t share their

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:57.030
Caption: knowledge and experiences through

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:59.920
Caption: speaking and so forth you may feel like

00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:03.780
Caption: well I don&#39;t have anything important to

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:07.150
Caption: share my knowledge is insignificant

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:09.520
Caption: people or just will just scoffer or

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:14.140
Caption: laugh if I try to share you share

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:17.739
Caption: something you know I&#39;m I&#39;m a fraud and I

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:19.959
Caption: feel that way too so many times I&#39;ve

00:27:17.739 --> 00:27:22.510
Caption: taught I&#39;ve been speaking now for many

00:27:19.959 --> 00:27:24.489
Caption: years and I get to meet a lot of other

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:28.089
Caption: speakers this feeling of impostor

00:27:24.489 --> 00:27:32.890
Caption: syndrome is universal except for a

00:27:28.089 --> 00:27:34.989
Caption: couple of freaks the the key thing

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:39.219
Caption: though is that you don&#39;t have to be an

00:27:34.989 --> 00:27:44.010
Caption: expert you have something that no one

00:27:39.219 --> 00:27:48.609
Caption: else has and that is your experience

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:51.699
Caption: people can argue with semantics and best

00:27:48.609 --> 00:27:54.729
Caption: practices or whatever all day long but

00:27:51.699 --> 00:27:57.219
Caption: they cannot argue with your experience

00:27:54.729 --> 00:28:00.040
Caption: they can&#39;t argue with your motivation

00:27:57.219 --> 00:28:04.239
Caption: for doing something and for what you&#39;ve

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:06.580
Caption: learned from your experiences even the

00:28:04.239 --> 00:28:08.679
Caption: mistakes that you&#39;ve made it may sound

00:28:06.579 --> 00:28:11.859
Caption: counterintuitive well I don&#39;t want to

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:14.770
Caption: share the mistakes well that could be

00:28:11.859 --> 00:28:17.020
Caption: the most valuable information that you

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:20.770
Caption: could give someone else to say hey look

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:23.920
Caption: I messed up here and I want you to not

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:26.469
Caption: make the same mistakes I made don&#39;t be

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:30.270
Caption: afraid to share your knowledge and

00:28:26.469 --> 00:28:30.270
Caption: experience with others

00:28:31.119 --> 00:28:40.069
Caption: you ever heard of the Dilbert principle

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:43.130
Caption: it&#39;s basically the most ineffective

00:28:40.069 --> 00:28:45.199
Caption: workers are systematically promoted to

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:50.359
Caption: the position where they can do the least

00:28:45.199 --> 00:28:53.298
Caption: amount of damage just management now

00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:55.849
Caption: early in my career I worked underneath a

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:59.269
Caption: boss that exemplified this this Dilbert

00:28:55.849 --> 00:29:00.048
Caption: principle I he was he was pretty

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.690
Caption: horrible

00:29:00.048 --> 00:29:05.689
Caption: and I really didn&#39;t like the man

00:29:02.689 --> 00:29:07.899
Caption: personally or professionally and his

00:29:05.689 --> 00:29:10.969
Caption: incompetence was legendary

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:13.070
Caption: he was notoriously bad mistakes were

00:29:10.969 --> 00:29:17.390
Caption: named after him and yet he continued to

00:29:13.069 --> 00:29:20.689
Caption: rise in rank and responsibilities a lot

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:23.928
Caption: of the work that I was required to do

00:29:20.689 --> 00:29:28.609
Caption: under his direction was of no value to

00:29:23.928 --> 00:29:31.969
Caption: anyone for example I was asked to create

00:29:28.609 --> 00:29:35.959
Caption: a huge binder of documentation for every

00:29:31.969 --> 00:29:38.780
Caption: method every stored procedure for all

00:29:35.959 --> 00:29:42.140
Caption: the code that I was you know my team was

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:47.419
Caption: was writing and no one was going to read

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:51.380
Caption: this ever meaningless and pointless work

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:54.678
Caption: is soul-crushing and i toughed it out

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:56.298
Caption: for more than a year but with I did

00:29:54.678 --> 00:29:58.939
Caption: everything that I could to get out from

00:29:56.298 --> 00:30:03.529
Caption: underneath his management but with no

00:29:58.939 --> 00:30:08.629
Caption: hope and insight I took a job working

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:10.489
Caption: somewhere else and I said to myself life

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:13.400
Caption: is too short to work somewhere that

00:30:10.489 --> 00:30:16.910
Caption: stinks I started living by this

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:19.280
Caption: philosophy and I started giving it as

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:22.280
Caption: advice to others when I heard them

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:25.880
Caption: complaining about their workplace in

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:29.210
Caption: technology we are very privileged that

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:31.609
Caption: we are in such high demand that we can

00:30:29.209 --> 00:30:32.928
Caption: by and large pick and choose where we

00:30:31.609 --> 00:30:35.660
Caption: get to work if you don&#39;t like where

00:30:32.928 --> 00:30:38.689
Caption: you&#39;re working there&#39;s there&#39;s five

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:41.830
Caption: recruiters you know that can&#39;t wait to

00:30:38.689 --> 00:30:41.829
Caption: network with you right now

00:30:42.808 --> 00:30:50.329
Caption: not that that isn&#39;t the case for most

00:30:45.779 --> 00:30:52.919
Caption: other professions now the problem is

00:30:50.329 --> 00:30:55.199
Caption: this idea began to pollute my

00:30:52.918 --> 00:30:58.949
Caption: perspective and I when things started to

00:30:55.199 --> 00:31:02.099
Caption: go sour I would think oh great here we

00:30:58.949 --> 00:31:04.128
Caption: go again time to start looking for a new

00:31:02.099 --> 00:31:04.129
Caption: job

00:31:05.418 --> 00:31:11.398
Caption: sometime later I was in a similar

00:31:08.159 --> 00:31:13.320
Caption: situation I was unhappy with work and

00:31:11.399 --> 00:31:15.960
Caption: what you know things that I was doing

00:31:13.319 --> 00:31:17.489
Caption: and I started interviewing for other at

00:31:15.959 --> 00:31:22.168
Caption: other companies and I had a really

00:31:17.489 --> 00:31:23.639
Caption: attractive job offer and I was trying to

00:31:22.168 --> 00:31:26.758
Caption: decide whether or not I should accept

00:31:23.639 --> 00:31:29.669
Caption: the offer and that&#39;s when my wife asked

00:31:26.759 --> 00:31:30.570
Caption: me two questions that stopped me in my

00:31:29.668 --> 00:31:35.308
Caption: tracks

00:31:30.569 --> 00:31:39.748
Caption: she asked have you done everything that

00:31:35.308 --> 00:31:43.099
Caption: you can possibly do and if you left now

00:31:39.749 --> 00:31:43.099
Caption: would you have any regrets

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:56.290
Caption: fine I declined the job offer and I

00:31:53.650 --> 00:32:01.969
Caption: committed to doing everything in my

00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:05.950
Caption: power to make my team successful in the

00:32:01.969 --> 00:32:11.089
Caption: end I still left that job one year later

00:32:05.949 --> 00:32:14.479
Caption: but I left having no regrets and being

00:32:11.089 --> 00:32:17.239
Caption: extremely proud of the work that we had

00:32:14.479 --> 00:32:25.609
Caption: accomplished it had been one of the most

00:32:17.239 --> 00:32:29.209
Caption: prolific years in my entire career sure

00:32:25.609 --> 00:32:32.479
Caption: there can be toxic environments there

00:32:29.209 --> 00:32:34.969
Caption: can be career limiting situations and

00:32:32.479 --> 00:32:37.239
Caption: there can be you know incredible

00:32:34.969 --> 00:32:41.719
Caption: opportunities that come along that

00:32:37.239 --> 00:32:46.239
Caption: justify changing a job but for

00:32:41.719 --> 00:32:49.969
Caption: everything else I&#39;ve got a new mindset

00:32:46.239 --> 00:32:53.179
Caption: life is too short to let things stay the

00:32:49.969 --> 00:32:56.630
Caption: way they are I&#39;ve learned that taking

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:59.000
Caption: ownership and responsibility is always

00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:01.010
Caption: the right thing to do and it has

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.439
Caption: far-reaching effects remember I said

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:07.250
Caption: people are watching you and when they

00:33:03.439 --> 00:33:08.689
Caption: see you bucking up and saying we&#39;re

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:12.280
Caption: gonna we&#39;re going to make this better

00:33:08.689 --> 00:33:16.309
Caption: what can I do to make this better

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:20.390
Caption: they&#39;re gonna notice it&#39;s always the

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:25.850
Caption: right time to do the right thing as I

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:28.339
Caption: believe Martin Luther King jr. said now

00:33:25.849 --> 00:33:31.099
Caption: every now and again you know on the flip

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:33.640
Caption: side of the coin we have to say goodbye

00:33:31.099 --> 00:33:36.049
Caption: to some people and sometimes they&#39;re

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:39.349
Caption: really really good people we don&#39;t want

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:41.540
Caption: to see going and regardless of the

00:33:39.349 --> 00:33:43.280
Caption: circumstances we let them know how much

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:47.270
Caption: we&#39;re going to miss them sometimes we

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:50.210
Caption: throw a party and you know celebrate all

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:52.640
Caption: the work and and you know special things

00:33:50.209 --> 00:33:56.429
Caption: that they have done on our team and in

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:58.560
Caption: our organization you know we might even

00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:00.540
Caption: you know talk about funny stories

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:03.480
Caption: remember that time you shot milk out of

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:04.979
Caption: your nose I&#39;m really gonna miss I&#39;m

00:34:03.479 --> 00:34:10.439
Caption: really gonna miss you shooting things

00:34:04.979 --> 00:34:16.520
Caption: out of your nose so I I began to wonder

00:34:10.439 --> 00:34:19.859
Caption: what why why do we have to wait until

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:23.428
Caption: someone is leaving before we tell them

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:26.159
Caption: how awesome they are maybe if we had

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:31.500
Caption: told them in the first place they

00:34:26.158 --> 00:34:35.148
Caption: wouldn&#39;t be leaving maybe you know so I

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:38.639
Caption: decided to run an experiment every

00:34:35.148 --> 00:34:43.859
Caption: Friday afternoon I would post on our

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:47.189
Caption: slack a tribute to someone that I worked

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:50.669
Caption: with or someone within our organization

00:34:47.189 --> 00:34:52.408
Caption: and this example Nakota was our Customer

00:34:50.668 --> 00:34:57.589
