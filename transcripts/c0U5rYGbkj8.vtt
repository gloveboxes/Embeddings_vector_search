00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:23.770
Caption: of a hoverer last year so it&#39;s exciting

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:26.089
Caption: to make it to speak so once upon a time

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:32.720
Caption: when Angela and I were both much younger

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:36.169
Caption: I worked on a team as you do and we were

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.169
Caption: working supposedly a job as as tends to

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:41.179
Caption: happen and despite the fact that we were

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:43.789
Caption: supposedly agile we still had these

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:46.339
Caption: wretched deadlines and you know we&#39;d be

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:48.769
Caption: working weekends and and nights and it

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:50.389
Caption: was just a god-awful mess and at the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.820
Caption: same time I was reading about you know

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:56.119
Caption: agile sustainable pace and I&#39;m thinking

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.920
Caption: you know what real edge all wet places

00:02:56.119 --> 00:03:01.159
Caption: don&#39;t have deadlines we just doing this

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:03.979
Caption: wrong this is rubbish if only I was at

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.070
Caption: one of those real agile places that

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:08.869
Caption: would be fantastic and then I left that

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.959
Caption: company and I went to work at a real

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:13.339
Caption: agile place which made products and was

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.100
Caption: really product centric and was

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:17.839
Caption: everything I&#39;d even read about and um

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.260
Caption: yeah we still had deadlines and I

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:23.419
Caption: thought alright okay what&#39;s what&#39;s going

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:25.580
Caption: on here what&#39;s up with this and the

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:29.569
Caption: thing is in our case I was working at

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:32.720
Caption: zero and we had government legislation

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.370
Caption: you know guess what the ATO is not going

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.500
Caption: to move the end of the tax year for you

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:38.839
Caption: because your projects a little bit late

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.539
Caption: so a couple of the things I was working

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:43.268
Caption: on was making text digital which is a

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:46.129
Caption: project in the UK

00:03:43.268 --> 00:03:47.080
Caption: HMRC which is their equivalent of the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.309
Caption: ATO

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.110
Caption: we were working on a project for that

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:53.268
Caption: implementing that at zero and also

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.419
Caption: simple abbess which was another hgo

00:03:53.268 --> 00:03:58.268
Caption: project but hey you know maybe there&#39;s

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.380
Caption: another kind of deadline again

00:03:58.268 --> 00:04:01.578
Caption: Australian Open date they&#39;re not going

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.270
Caption: to shift it just because the websites

00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:06.489
Caption: not ready so you know or maybe your

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.559
Caption: company and

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.200
Caption: company are kind of in a little bit of a

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:13.389
Caption: race to put something out first you know

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.559
Caption: zero and where would be one of them put

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.750
Caption: something out the other ones like oh

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:18.369
Caption: yeah well we&#39;ll get there first

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.130
Caption: so that might be a reason you&#39;re trying

00:04:18.369 --> 00:04:25.660
Caption: to put thing something up before a

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.029
Caption: certain date people another date that&#39;s

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.610
Caption: not going to shift no one&#39;s going to

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:32.829
Caption: move their birth delivery date of their

00:04:30.609 --> 00:04:35.289
Caption: child because they have a thing that

00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:37.709
Caption: they need to work on so you might need

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.809
Caption: to you know adhere to that deadline

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:43.389
Caption: another example might be you&#39;ve made

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:44.769
Caption: this wonderful proclamation so again at

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.540
Caption: zero they have these enormous

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:48.250
Caption: conferences called zero con where

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.140
Caption: somebody stands up and says we are going

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.299
Caption: to deliver this amazing thing by the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.220
Caption: first quarter and you really want to

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:56.829
Caption: actually be able to do that because if

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.630
Caption: you don&#39;t you kind of end up with

00:04:56.829 --> 00:05:01.299
Caption: something like this so this is a site

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.179
Caption: called Ellen musk today and it&#39;s

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:06.190
Caption: entirely devoted to tracking all the

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:08.940
Caption: promises mr. musk has made on Twitter

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.989
Caption: and how he&#39;s kind of tracking to that

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.140
Caption: you know spoiler alert

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:15.759
Caption: generally not so good so you know I mean

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.120
Caption: this is this is a bit of a joke right

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.040
Caption: this is slightly exaggerated but I found

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:23.290
Caption: hell hath no fury like a customer

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.300
Caption: scorned so you really you really don&#39;t

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.540
Caption: want to do that so where did this

00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:30.399
Caption: impression come from if you tweeted the

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.260
Caption: first one to show that I&#39;m a

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:34.419
Caption: you can tweet this one now and say yeah

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.690
Caption: no I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really the case

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.850
Caption: that&#39;s kind of what I thought it&#39;s not

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.040
Caption: in the agile manifesto they do talk

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.369
Caption: about sustainable peace but they don&#39;t

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.380
Caption: say we value not having deadlines right

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:50.410
Caption: so I&#39;m thinking there&#39;s probably a

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.440
Caption: couple of reasons why younger more naive

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.110
Caption: me had this impression and the first one

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.299
Caption: is a lot of times we talk about

00:05:56.109 --> 00:06:00.309
Caption: companies that are doing it right or

00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:04.629
Caption: doing it good has anybody heard of the

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:07.899
Caption: Spotify model you know Spotify Facebook

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.910
Caption: Google Twitter Netflix you know these

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:12.009
Caption: are all companies that held up as being

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.739
Caption: these are the great places to work right

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.360
Caption: but I don&#39;t know about you and maybe I

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:18.279
Caption: missed the memo but I don&#39;t ever hear

00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:20.049
Caption: Facebook saying we&#39;re bringing you this

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:21.250
Caption: awesome new feature next three

00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:24.098
Caption: stay you&#39;re just logging in and it&#39;s

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.470
Caption: like - ah what just happened Google

00:06:24.098 --> 00:06:29.559
Caption: sometimes gives you the ability to swap

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.779
Caption: in or out Google Calendar I&#39;m looking at

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:33.609
Caption: you they&#39;ve brought up the new version

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.799
Caption: of calendar and they still let you go

00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:37.658
Caption: back to the old one which was just as

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:39.279
Caption: well because all the stuff that was in

00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:41.289
Caption: the old one wasn&#39;t really in the new one

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.878
Caption: yet when they first brought it out so

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.759
Caption: you kind of had to go back to the old

00:06:42.878 --> 00:06:47.289
Caption: one YouTube still has some of that but

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.848
Caption: sometimes you just get what you get and

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:51.429
Caption: you can&#39;t swap back and then you get

00:06:48.848 --> 00:06:54.878
Caption: things like this so probably most people

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:58.628
Caption: know Ming I was in the middle of writing

00:06:54.878 --> 00:07:02.009
Caption: this talk and Ming kindly put this on

00:06:58.628 --> 00:07:04.869
Caption: LinkedIn as an example of the sort of

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:07.419
Caption: feeling that you have is user when

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:10.089
Caption: you&#39;re merrily using your product in

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:12.908
Caption: which case Facebook and they make a

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:18.489
Caption: small change and she was a little bit

00:07:12.908 --> 00:07:22.449
Caption: displeased with that ah yeah so the

00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:26.079
Caption: other thing that people associate with

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:27.550
Caption: with deadlines is is this guy I don&#39;t

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:29.289
Caption: know if everybody seen the movie office

00:07:27.549 --> 00:07:33.429
Caption: space it&#39;s kind of required viewing for

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:35.889
Caption: people in our industry and even the word

00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:37.569
Caption: deadline people just have this like that

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:39.098
Caption: as soon as you say deadline you&#39;re like

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:41.589
Caption: oh that&#39;s it my life is over

00:07:39.098 --> 00:07:44.559
Caption: so we end up calling things milestones

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:46.690
Caption: and goals and things that are a little

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:49.899
Caption: bit less horrifying because as soon as

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.878
Caption: you say deadlines people just think this

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:53.829
Caption: guy&#39;s gonna show up and tell you that

00:07:51.878 --> 00:07:55.658
Caption: you&#39;re just gonna go I have to ask you

00:07:53.829 --> 00:07:57.489
Caption: to go ahead and come in and Saturday and

00:07:55.658 --> 00:07:59.559
Caption: Sunday and there goes your weekend in

00:07:57.489 --> 00:08:02.859
Caption: your life and you&#39;ll sleep and as in the

00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:04.959
Caption: previous talk it&#39;s burnout city and you

00:08:02.859 --> 00:08:06.908
Caption: just hope that if only we did this agile

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:11.019
Caption: think properly all this horror would

00:08:06.908 --> 00:08:14.229
Caption: disappear another thing I saw on

00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:16.750
Caption: LinkedIn from Josh Pataki who&#39;s a scrum

00:08:14.229 --> 00:08:19.000
Caption: coach I think he&#39;s sometimes around poof

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.769
Caption: and somehow he ends up always putting

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.449
Caption: something on social media around about

00:08:20.769 --> 00:08:24.429
Caption: at the time I&#39;m doing a talk side

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:27.550
Caption: he&#39;s a feature of my talks for some

00:08:24.429 --> 00:08:29.079
Caption: reason so he&#39;s got this manifesto for

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:31.629
Caption: deadline driven development we&#39;re

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:33.070
Caption: uncovering better ways of developing

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.229
Caption: software by doing lots of over

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:38.500
Caption: and you know possibly forcing others to

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:41.229
Caption: do it right but does it have to be like

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.570
Caption: this I mean if we if we&#39;re taking it as

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:47.140
Caption: a given that sometimes deadlines happen

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:49.539
Caption: for reasons there must be some other way

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.950
Caption: we can cope apart from turning into the

00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:53.229
Caption: guy telling you you have to come in and

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:55.359
Caption: and having these horrible manifestos we

00:08:53.229 --> 00:08:57.579
Caption: want to avoid the death march and the

00:08:55.359 --> 00:08:59.769
Caption: mini waterfall horror so what I&#39;m going

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.410
Caption: to try and do in the next few minutes is

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:04.960
Caption: to give you some ideas of things that we

00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:13.719
Caption: had tried and that kind of helped with

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:16.240
Caption: this obviously the answer is because if

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:17.169
Caption: only we did this right then everything

00:09:16.239 --> 00:09:19.419
Caption: would be fine

00:09:17.169 --> 00:09:21.190
Caption: you know come on we just need to get

00:09:19.419 --> 00:09:24.669
Caption: better at estimating has anybody ever

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:28.210
Caption: heard anybody say this and the first

00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:29.950
Caption: time I heard that I thought wow okay you

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.470
Caption: know we could spend a whole lot of time

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:33.790
Caption: improving anything and really this is

00:09:32.469 --> 00:09:38.529
Caption: what you want to spend the time and

00:09:33.789 --> 00:09:41.139
Caption: effort on you know to a lot of people

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:43.060
Caption: when you say estimate where there&#39;s an

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.130
Caption: estimate there&#39;s an actual identify

00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:47.169
Caption: manager I get to compare them and then I

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.400
Caption: get to say well are you really not very

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:49.869
Caption: good at estimating because look at the

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:54.220
Caption: difference between your estimates in

00:09:49.869 --> 00:09:55.960
Caption: your actuals do better but you know is

00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:59.229
Caption: that is really is that what we want to

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.400
Caption: spend our time on I question this so in

00:09:59.229 --> 00:10:02.709
Caption: there&#39;s a book called lean software

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.900
Caption: development which maybe some people have

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.640
Caption: heard of was written by the pop index

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.920
Caption: Mary and Tom pop and dick and this is

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.020
Caption: what they have to say about waste so

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:13.959
Caption: it&#39;s anything that doesn&#39;t add value to

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:17.050
Caption: a product and the value is determined by

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.360
Caption: the customer so I don&#39;t know about you

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:21.849
Caption: as customers I know certainly when I get

00:10:19.359 --> 00:10:23.169
Caption: a product I don&#39;t go well you know it&#39;s

00:10:21.849 --> 00:10:25.389
Caption: all right but I wish they&#39;ve done a

00:10:23.169 --> 00:10:26.709
Caption: better job estimating I mean customers

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:31.420
Caption: can&#39;t see that stuff

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:33.280
Caption: so if I look at this definition time

00:10:31.419 --> 00:10:35.919
Caption: spent estimating is by definition a

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.780
Caption: waste right and it should be minimized

00:10:35.919 --> 00:10:39.429
Caption: with the goal of trying to eliminate it

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:43.180
Caption: rather than spending time getting better

00:10:39.429 --> 00:10:45.520
Caption: because if you&#39;re spending time on it to

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:46.349
Caption: try and improve that kind of increases

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.960
Caption: the waste

00:10:46.349 --> 00:10:50.789
Caption: I&#39;m not gonna say hashtag no estimates

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.760
Caption: don&#39;t ever do that

00:10:50.789 --> 00:10:57.269
Caption: it summons trolls if you do that on

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.559
Caption: social media I am not joking there&#39;s a

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.630
Caption: group of people in Melbourne we were

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:02.279
Caption: setting up agile drinks and it was like

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.349
Caption: what time do you think you&#39;re going to

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.570
Caption: be there and their comment was I&#39;m not

00:11:04.349 --> 00:11:09.589
Caption: really sure hashtag no estimates haha

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:13.410
Caption: boom here comes the guy well you know

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:18.750
Caption: he&#39;s trolling a pub conversation wow

00:11:13.409 --> 00:11:21.839
Caption: these people are intense what I will say

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:25.440
Caption: is to try and spend less time on

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.220
Caption: estimating not more okay fine I who say

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.780
Caption: that sounds good

00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:29.429
Caption: but we still need a way to know when

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:33.210
Caption: will it be done and are you done yet

00:11:29.429 --> 00:11:35.760
Caption: so alright alternatives please what we

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:38.369
Caption: want to try and do is to make our work

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:42.660
Caption: as simple transparent and predictable as

00:11:38.369 --> 00:11:44.609
Caption: possible okay sounds logical so

00:11:42.659 --> 00:11:46.679
Caption: predictable this is a quote from Neil

00:11:44.609 --> 00:11:49.799
Caption: Killick and he says that predictability

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:52.440
Caption: is improved by behaving and delivering

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:55.679
Caption: more predictably not by getting better

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.909
Caption: at making predictions right so probably

00:11:55.679 --> 00:11:58.950
Caption: people have heard this kind of thing

00:11:56.909 --> 00:12:00.809
Caption: before we want to try and put something

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:04.169
Caption: valuable into the hands of users belly

00:12:00.809 --> 00:12:07.729
Caption: on get some feedback and try and do it

00:12:04.169 --> 00:12:09.719
Caption: on a regular basis you know hello scrum

00:12:07.729 --> 00:12:12.479
Caption: probably a lot of people have seen this

00:12:09.719 --> 00:12:15.509
Caption: drawing before as well if you haven&#39;t

00:12:12.479 --> 00:12:18.630
Caption: seen it it&#39;s from Henrik Nyberg and I&#39;m

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:20.460
Caption: gonna relate it to deadlines so if

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.780
Caption: you&#39;re assuming that what you&#39;re trying

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:25.230
Caption: to do is get somewhere faster than

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:28.020
Caption: walking right I can quickly give you a

00:12:25.229 --> 00:12:29.039
Caption: skateboard and say here you go

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.170
Caption: this would be some way faster than

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:34.469
Caption: walking and as a customer you might go

00:12:31.169 --> 00:12:37.889
Caption: well kind of like the wheels but it&#39;s a

00:12:34.469 --> 00:12:40.829
Caption: bit wobbly and to be honest it&#39;s not

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.119
Caption: really that much less effort then it was

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.340
Caption: when I was walking a little bit faster

00:12:42.119 --> 00:12:46.609
Caption: so then you can say alright here&#39;s a

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:49.440
Caption: scooter and so forth and so on

00:12:46.609 --> 00:12:51.419
Caption: now what the person or your customer

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.580
Caption: might have been thinking of is what I

00:12:51.419 --> 00:12:56.609
Caption: really want is a car okay

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:59.260
Caption: but imagine if you&#39;re trucking along and

00:12:56.609 --> 00:13:01.899
Caption: you hit a deadline kind of here

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:04.510
Caption: now if if I was going straight for the

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:07.420
Caption: car when I get to that point you know

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:10.809
Caption: and it&#39;s C aton date or whatever you

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:13.329
Caption: have to ship if I&#39;m going straight for

00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:15.940
Caption: the car I&#39;ve got two wheels and some

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:18.010
Caption: sort of axle which is not very helpful

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:21.309
Caption: if I&#39;m going with the bottom one at

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:23.260
Caption: least I have a bike so I would say the

00:13:21.309 --> 00:13:24.580
Caption: bottom one is going to work better when

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.790
Caption: you&#39;re when you&#39;re faced with a deadline

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.710
Caption: okay so you&#39;re trying to have something

00:13:27.789 --> 00:13:33.070
Caption: useful along the way rather than going

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:35.290
Caption: straight for the gold standard which

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:37.419
Caption: also sounds good in theory it&#39;s lovely

00:13:35.289 --> 00:13:39.669
Caption: picture but how do you actually do this

00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:42.909
Caption: kind of thing so my first recommendation

00:13:39.669 --> 00:13:45.209
Caption: is story mapping has everybody heard of

00:13:42.909 --> 00:13:47.559
Caption: story mapping before or a few people

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:50.140
Caption: there&#39;s a book by Jeff pattern called

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:51.940
Caption: user story mapping which I didn&#39;t bother

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.619
Caption: with for quite a long time because I

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.109
Caption: thought that doesn&#39;t sound very

00:13:53.619 --> 00:13:57.909
Caption: interesting so I will try and resell it

00:13:56.109 --> 00:13:59.529
Caption: to you as everything you ever wanted to

00:13:57.909 --> 00:14:01.899
Caption: know about doing anything with stories

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.940
Caption: or developing ever because there&#39;s a

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.309
Caption: whole bunch of stuff in there that&#39;s

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:10.479
Caption: really really helpful so the idea of a

00:14:06.309 --> 00:14:12.880
Caption: story map is as it sort of sounds it&#39;s a

00:14:10.479 --> 00:14:15.609
Caption: map of a story so you start from one

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.530
Caption: side over here and it&#39;s what users will

00:14:15.609 --> 00:14:21.130
Caption: do with your system or your product

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:24.090
Caption: going across and it&#39;s written in plain

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:28.090
Caption: English words know kind of techno jargon

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:30.370
Caption: across the top is the major activities

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:32.170
Caption: that can be broken down and underneath

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:35.440
Caption: each one is what it can be broken down

00:14:32.169 --> 00:14:37.889
Caption: into so the example that Jeff uses in

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.820
Caption: the book is if I&#39;m doing a map of

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.530
Caption: getting ready to go to work in the

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.780
Caption: morning and this is a great exercise a

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:46.540
Caption: typical kind of workshop thing you can

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.160
Caption: do when you&#39;re practicing this one of

00:14:46.539 --> 00:14:50.380
Caption: the things across the top might be I&#39;m

00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:52.750
Caption: getting cleaned up and that might break

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:56.770
Caption: down into these short verb phrases

00:14:52.750 --> 00:15:00.489
Caption: things like have a shower do my hair

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:01.840
Caption: shave put on makeup you know another one

00:15:00.489 --> 00:15:02.979
Caption: might be get dressed and you might go

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.440
Caption: through all the different garments and

00:15:02.979 --> 00:15:06.909
Caption: different things people different people

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.140
Caption: will do different things but it&#39;s

00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:11.049
Caption: something that&#39;s quite easy to

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.820
Caption: understand and easy to explain to

00:15:11.049 --> 00:15:15.880
Caption: somebody what it&#39;s

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:17.530
Caption: how it works so if we&#39;re looking at

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.929
Caption: something that&#39;s simple it&#39;s a pretty

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:21.750
Caption: simple concept it&#39;s like so many things

00:15:19.929 --> 00:15:24.070
Caption: that are simple doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easy

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.869
Caption: and if you put this thing up on a wall

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.700
Caption: like you can see here it&#39;s also pretty

00:15:25.869 --> 00:15:29.440
Caption: transparent right anybody can walk past

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.890
Caption: there what are you working on it&#39;s like

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.900
Caption: ah is this thing I prepared earlier and

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:36.970
Caption: it&#39;s quite easy to explain to them what

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.770
Caption: you&#39;re doing and how it relates to a

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:43.479
Caption: customer so that&#39;s another part of this

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:46.320
Caption: it&#39;s it&#39;s very customer focused when you

00:15:43.479 --> 00:15:49.690
Caption: build this and as you iterate through it

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.690
Caption: so breaking it down when you have your

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:55.000
Caption: map laid out so if you&#39;ve got your big

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:56.619
Caption: story at the top and then you&#39;ve got

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.309
Caption: your smaller stories lined up underneath

00:15:56.619 --> 00:16:03.909
Caption: you can literally draw a line underneath

00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:08.109
Caption: a part of it that relates to a goal that

00:16:03.909 --> 00:16:10.509
Caption: can be completed and I don&#39;t it may or

00:16:08.109 --> 00:16:12.909
Caption: may not be an actual release depending

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:15.520
Caption: on how you term the word release because

00:16:12.909 --> 00:16:17.109
Caption: people oh we do CD we do 200 releases a

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.700
Caption: date okay that&#39;s fine

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:21.279
Caption: but it&#39;s really a thing you can give a

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.410
Caption: customer to get some feedback right so

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.940
Caption: how Jeff so that this is something I

00:16:23.409 --> 00:16:26.649
Caption: blogged from Jeff Patton I didn&#39;t before

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.940
Caption: this actually in his book and on his

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.350
Caption: website

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:31.539
Caption: the first thing you want to do is the

00:16:29.349 --> 00:16:33.279
Caption: good enough so that might be your

00:16:31.539 --> 00:16:35.109
Caption: skateboard and then you get some

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.120
Caption: feedback and then you make it better and

00:16:35.109 --> 00:16:41.529
Caption: so forth and so on until you get to the

00:16:37.119 --> 00:16:45.219
Caption: really best thing that you can do this

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.450
Caption: is a example doctrine a turd because I

00:16:45.219 --> 00:16:47.739
Caption: went through all my photos and went

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.570
Caption: under if I have a real picture of

00:16:47.739 --> 00:16:52.109
Caption: something we actually did so the

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:54.700
Caption: interesting thing here is that it

00:16:52.109 --> 00:16:56.589
Caption: coincidentally fairly well resembles the

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.989
Caption: previous thing so this was for making

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.490
Caption: text digital we had a compliance goal

00:16:58.989 --> 00:17:03.130
Caption: that we had to had to had to meet by

00:17:00.489 --> 00:17:07.449
Caption: certain date so that was a very minimum

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:09.310
Caption: MVP what we ended up doing was in some

00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:12.549
Caption: cases removing some of the bells and

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:14.800
Caption: whistles that had been in previous UK

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:17.020
Caption: tax fulfilment to really focus on that

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.340
Caption: goal and then we started adding things

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.589
Caption: back in and making it more and more

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:22.329
Caption: whiz-bang so by the time we got to the

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:25.599
Caption: bottom part it was the bells and

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:26.909
Caption: whistles or singing or dancing but if if

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:29.579
Caption: a deadline came and

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:31.050
Caption: all we&#39;d done was the compliance goal we

00:17:29.579 --> 00:17:32.729
Caption: were fine we could ship that and we

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:35.190
Caption: would know that we do at least met the

00:17:32.729 --> 00:17:37.229
Caption: bare minimum for compliance so this is a

00:17:35.189 --> 00:17:40.559
Caption: pretty high-level thing because our

00:17:37.229 --> 00:17:42.119
Caption: board wasn&#39;t that big but yeah you can

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:46.580
Caption: see that we sort of followed that pretty

00:17:42.119 --> 00:17:48.750
Caption: well so that was good who uses JIRA

00:17:46.579 --> 00:17:49.529
Caption: pretty much yeah lots of people use JIRA

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.109
Caption: ok

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:55.410
Caption: again not being paid for this but there

00:17:52.109 --> 00:17:58.199
Caption: is a third-party add-on with the really

00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:00.900
Caption: snappy name of easy agile story map for

00:17:58.199 --> 00:18:04.139
Caption: JIRA I don&#39;t know is anybody using this

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:06.839
Caption: if you&#39;re doing story mapping and you&#39;re

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.760
Caption: using JIRA it is not a free thing you

00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:11.069
Caption: will have to pay for it but it&#39;s a

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.489
Caption: really really good idea because what we

00:18:11.069 --> 00:18:16.859
Caption: found was when we started with the big

00:18:13.489 --> 00:18:19.469
Caption: wall and put everything on there because

00:18:16.859 --> 00:18:22.799
Caption: we were using JIRA for the day-to-day we

00:18:19.469 --> 00:18:24.539
Caption: could mimic that giant wall in JIRA and

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.860
Caption: then it was so much easier to follow

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.800
Caption: along and keep things going in our

00:18:25.859 --> 00:18:30.239
Caption: slices could then become related to

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:33.390
Caption: releases in JIRA and we could do sprints

00:18:30.239 --> 00:18:33.989
Caption: within that and it just it was it was

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:37.979
Caption: really good

00:18:33.989 --> 00:18:39.750
Caption: I was surprised yeah so also great for

00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:40.890
Caption: people that work remotely because you

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.959
Caption: know I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever tried

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.810
Caption: to do a remote meeting where you&#39;re

00:18:42.959 --> 00:18:47.339
Caption: trying to hold up somebody&#39;s machine so

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.720
Caption: they can see the physical board right

00:18:47.339 --> 00:18:51.299
Caption: yeah you can&#39;t read what&#39;s on the card

00:18:48.719 --> 00:18:54.270
Caption: but it&#39;s up there somewhere this is much

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:57.690
Caption: much better so if you are using JIRA +1

00:18:54.270 --> 00:19:02.400
Caption: for this thing ok so now we&#39;ve got our

00:18:57.689 --> 00:19:04.739
Caption: map thinking about story points so I

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.540
Caption: don&#39;t know how many of you all have ever

00:19:04.739 --> 00:19:10.520
Caption: been in a you know planning meeting

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:13.830
Caption: where you&#39;ve spent way too much time

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:16.469
Caption: trying to decide if a story is a 3 or 5

00:19:13.829 --> 00:19:19.019
Caption: and people will be having the heated

00:19:16.469 --> 00:19:21.000
Caption: argument while everybody else is going

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:25.260
Caption: maybe this only happened to me I don&#39;t

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.510
Caption: know but again why why why are you doing

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.670
Caption: that and even worse that whole thing

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:32.640
Caption: where people go ok so that yeah that&#39;ll

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:34.619
Caption: take me a week so yeah that&#39;s a 5 and

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.609
Caption: and then you get to the other end where

00:19:34.619 --> 00:19:39.760
Caption: somebody&#39;s going ok so that

00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:42.729
Caption: 9 so that&#39;s what it&#39;ll take you two

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.589
Caption: weeks like why are you doing that why

00:19:42.729 --> 00:19:46.089
Caption: would you take time to put it it&#39;s a

00:19:44.589 --> 00:19:51.339
Caption: story points to then put it back at the

00:19:46.089 --> 00:19:52.689
Caption: time and I mean this is the numbers

00:19:51.339 --> 00:19:56.650
Caption: they&#39;re just Wow

00:19:52.689 --> 00:19:59.169
Caption: why so I you know I I sort of question

00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:00.609
Caption: this and it like heresy because we all

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.619
Caption: know that if you&#39;re agile you have tests

00:20:00.609 --> 00:20:07.058
Caption: or points right you know and then I saw

00:20:02.619 --> 00:20:11.319
Caption: this from Ron Jeffries and he said ah 1

00:20:07.058 --> 00:20:13.928
Caption: 2 and she big odd days not points and I

00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:15.308
Caption: went oh yeah that&#39;s cool that&#39;s kind of

00:20:13.928 --> 00:20:17.380
Caption: what I think - you know this is how you

00:20:15.308 --> 00:20:19.349
Caption: can size stories it takes one day takes

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.199
Caption: two days or it&#39;s too big break it down

00:20:19.349 --> 00:20:26.668
Caption: if you don&#39;t know who Ron Jeffries is

00:20:22.199 --> 00:20:26.668
Caption: he&#39;s the guy who invented story points

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:34.400
Caption: and he&#39;s been spending a lot of time

00:20:31.428 --> 00:20:38.089
Caption: apologizing it for it since and for the

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.770
Caption: misuse of story points because the idea

00:20:38.089 --> 00:20:41.569
Caption: was with the best of intentions it was

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.250
Caption: to stop people from being beaten by

00:20:41.569 --> 00:20:45.469
Caption: saying you told me this would take two

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:47.209
Caption: days and it took four you know how dare

00:20:45.469 --> 00:20:48.979
Caption: you um so they thought well how could

00:20:47.209 --> 00:20:50.719
Caption: fool you it&#39;s that&#39;s not in days the

00:20:48.979 --> 00:20:53.510
Caption: same points but everybody just

00:20:50.719 --> 00:20:54.829
Caption: translates it so I thought okay I&#39;m in

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:59.390
Caption: good company here if I&#39;m questioning

00:20:54.829 --> 00:21:03.439
Caption: this so my suggestion of something to

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:06.650
Caption: try is to break the work down into kind

00:21:03.439 --> 00:21:09.139
Caption: of stories of the same size as best as

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:12.890
Caption: you can either using you know that one

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:14.599
Caption: to two big idea or no killings got

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:16.729
Caption: another one where he says each story

00:21:14.599 --> 00:21:18.049
Caption: should fulfill one acceptance criterion

00:21:16.729 --> 00:21:20.000
Caption: so if you&#39;re using acceptance criteria

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:21.890
Caption: try and make your story is the same size

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.260
Caption: and know you&#39;ll never get them all

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:27.040
Caption: exactly the same size but the idea is to

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:29.630
Caption: try and do that and if you can do that

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.429
Caption: then you can start just counting how

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:34.790
Caption: many you have instead of worrying about

00:21:31.428 --> 00:21:37.760
Caption: how big each one is and then things get

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:40.070
Caption: easier and if you are using jira you can

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.410
Caption: configure it to use story counts instead

00:21:40.069 --> 00:21:46.219
Caption: of story points or time woo so it&#39;s just

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:49.849
Caption: another level of simplification another

00:21:46.219 --> 00:21:52.189
Caption: thing that I suggest everybody everybody

00:21:49.849 --> 00:21:56.058
Caption: knows that we&#39;re agile so we measure

00:21:52.189 --> 00:21:59.329
Caption: velocity okay that&#39;s nice but I think if

00:21:56.058 --> 00:22:01.339
Caption: you look at lean theory the cycle time

00:21:59.329 --> 00:22:02.959
Caption: and throughput are actually a little bit

00:22:01.339 --> 00:22:05.510
Caption: more important so if you haven&#39;t heard

00:22:02.959 --> 00:22:07.189
Caption: of these things before the cycle time is

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:09.380
Caption: how long it takes you to get from a

00:22:07.189 --> 00:22:12.379
Caption: certain point in your process to a

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:14.300
Caption: certain other point so in software

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.949
Caption: development it&#39;s usually from you know

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.380
Caption: if you&#39;re doing this sort of board thing

00:22:15.949 --> 00:22:19.219
Caption: you take it from the to-do pile and it&#39;s

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.709
Caption: in progress

00:22:19.219 --> 00:22:23.750
Caption: all the way through until you know done

00:22:21.709 --> 00:22:25.039
Caption: done or released or finished or whatever

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:28.520
Caption: you want to call the column on the end

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:30.530
Caption: and your throughput is how many now that

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.320
Caption: we&#39;re counting stories I can count how

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:35.450
Caption: many stories they did per iteration so

00:22:33.319 --> 00:22:37.939
Caption: per sprint or per week or whatever

00:22:35.449 --> 00:22:40.699
Caption: you&#39;re doing I had teams that were doing

00:22:37.939 --> 00:22:42.439
Caption: Kanban that did by week or sprint we did

00:22:40.699 --> 00:22:44.538
Caption: two weeks

00:22:42.439 --> 00:22:46.518
Caption: yeah so if you&#39;re kind of looking at the

00:22:44.538 --> 00:22:51.048
Caption: idea of these two things instead of

00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:53.470
Caption: velocity the shortest cycle times are

00:22:51.048 --> 00:22:55.609
Caption: likely to have higher throughput and

00:22:53.469 --> 00:22:57.918
Caption: supposedly according to the Theory of

00:22:55.609 --> 00:23:00.619
Caption: Constraints the best way to optimize is

00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:02.508
Caption: to focus on your throughput so the idea

00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:04.129
Caption: is to try and get this predictability of

00:23:02.509 --> 00:23:07.220
Caption: pushing through the same number of

00:23:04.129 --> 00:23:09.379
Caption: stories per iteration again if you&#39;re in

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:12.349
Caption: G roll and they call this the control

00:23:09.379 --> 00:23:12.859
Caption: chart I don&#39;t know why but that&#39;s what

00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:15.079
Caption: it&#39;s called

00:23:12.859 --> 00:23:16.849
Caption: so if you&#39;re looking for cycle time it&#39;s

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:19.099
Caption: called control I guess they want to feel

00:23:16.849 --> 00:23:22.969
Caption: like they&#39;re controlling but it&#39;s quite

00:23:19.099 --> 00:23:25.548
Caption: an easy visual because if you&#39;re if your

00:23:22.969 --> 00:23:27.979
Caption: cycle time is roughly the same for each

00:23:25.548 --> 00:23:31.569
Caption: story these little green dots will be

00:23:27.979 --> 00:23:35.058
Caption: closely together and that shaded area

00:23:31.569 --> 00:23:36.618
Caption: will be thinner so you can just look at

00:23:35.058 --> 00:23:39.408
Caption: this and go well they&#39;re really far

00:23:36.619 --> 00:23:41.299
Caption: apart our stories aren&#39;t really equally

00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:43.669
Caption: sized if they kind of close you think

00:23:41.298 --> 00:23:47.298
Caption: yeah we&#39;re doing okay also I would

00:23:43.668 --> 00:23:49.189
Caption: suggest that one week to do per story

00:23:47.298 --> 00:23:51.378
Caption: might be a little bit big so you might

00:23:49.189 --> 00:23:53.418
Caption: want to get it down to the one to two

00:23:51.379 --> 00:23:56.179
Caption: days I think this is an example I just

00:23:53.418 --> 00:23:57.469
Caption: flogged off with the JIRA website

00:23:56.178 --> 00:24:02.148
Caption: nothing to do with anything I&#39;ve ever

00:23:57.469 --> 00:24:04.158
Caption: worked on mm-hmm so the next thing we

00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:05.149
Caption: can look at is forecasting so once

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:09.259
Caption: you&#39;ve started to become more

00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:10.940
Caption: predictable you can then think more

00:24:09.259 --> 00:24:13.519
Caption: about how your past performance can

00:24:10.939 --> 00:24:16.339
Caption: indicate future so if you&#39;re in Brisbane

00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:19.039
Caption: and at summer time for example the

00:24:16.339 --> 00:24:21.349
Caption: chances yesterday was hot with a chance

00:24:19.038 --> 00:24:23.658
Caption: of rain today will be higher with a

00:24:21.349 --> 00:24:25.398
Caption: chance of rain tomorrow will also be hot

00:24:23.659 --> 00:24:27.139
Caption: with a chance of rain because it&#39;s quite

00:24:25.399 --> 00:24:30.139
Caption: predictable in Melbourne on the other

00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:31.850
Caption: hand yet God knows you&#39;re on your own so

00:24:30.139 --> 00:24:33.859
Caption: bearing in mind of course this is a

00:24:31.849 --> 00:24:36.558
Caption: model all models are wrong that&#39;s

00:24:33.859 --> 00:24:37.519
Caption: something useful there&#39;s a number of

00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:40.339
Caption: different ways you can do this

00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:43.269
Caption: forecasting so again our friend JIRA has

00:24:40.339 --> 00:24:45.319
Caption: a burned-down thing which will tell you

00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:48.350
Caption: again this is something I just took off

00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:49.849
Caption: the bog standard Atlassian website based

00:24:48.349 --> 00:24:51.349
Caption: on your velocity for the last three

00:24:49.849 --> 00:24:52.759
Caption: sprints and will take you six more to

00:24:51.349 --> 00:24:52.999
Caption: complete this epic yeah that&#39;s pretty

00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:56.680
Caption: good

00:24:52.999 --> 00:25:00.290
Caption: not bad but we can do better

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:01.820
Caption: so probabilistic forecasting is the

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.440
Caption: reason why if you if you look at your

00:25:01.819 --> 00:25:07.039
Caption: weather app it doesn&#39;t tell you tomorrow

00:25:03.439 --> 00:25:09.019
Caption: or rain it tells you 60% chance of rain

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.470
Caption: tomorrow so it&#39;s it&#39;s working something

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.729
Caption: out

00:25:09.469 --> 00:25:16.369
Caption: based on probability in a forecasting

00:25:13.729 --> 00:25:18.559
Caption: software world this is the idea of what

00:25:16.369 --> 00:25:21.559
Caption: is the chance of finishing on or before

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.630
Caption: a certain date so how it works is you

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.550
Caption: look at what percentage of the possible

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:29.060
Caption: results were actually on or before that

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:31.070
Caption: date and then you can say oh we&#39;re 85%

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:36.080
Caption: sure we can deliver by the 17th of

00:25:31.069 --> 00:25:38.509
Caption: August so that&#39;s the other good thing is

00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:41.479
Caption: that probabilistic forecasting relies

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:44.089
Caption: upon the inputs to these sort of math

00:25:41.479 --> 00:25:47.299
Caption: things being in exact which is great

00:25:44.089 --> 00:25:51.679
Caption: because that&#39;s what we have and now here

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:53.960
Caption: it is the magic crystal ball so using

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.580
Caption: arthur c clarke third law of any

00:25:53.959 --> 00:25:57.109
Caption: sufficiently advanced technology is

00:25:55.579 --> 00:25:59.599
Caption: indistinguishable from magic

00:25:57.109 --> 00:26:02.119
Caption: here is my crystal ball this link takes

00:25:59.599 --> 00:26:04.130
Caption: you to a github repository that was put

00:26:02.119 --> 00:26:07.550
Caption: out there by troy McGinnis who is

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:09.650
Caption: forever I am forever thankful because

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:12.230
Caption: he&#39;s got a bunch of spreadsheets that do

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:14.989
Caption: all the maths for you which is awesome

00:26:12.229 --> 00:26:16.939
Caption: and the one I used as my magical

00:26:14.989 --> 00:26:20.510
Caption: prognosticator is called the throughput

00:26:16.939 --> 00:26:23.059
Caption: forecaster and what that is is an Excel

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:24.650
Caption: spreadsheet that does a whole bunch of

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.050
Caption: things some of them are the same things

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.609
Caption: that you can do in JIRA which is good if

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.650
Caption: you don&#39;t have jury you can use this and

00:26:28.609 --> 00:26:32.059
Caption: if you do you can be even lazier and not

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:39.770
Caption: use it and take the numbers right out of

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:41.270
Caption: JIRA and so how it worked is and this is

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:44.739
Caption: an example so the sheet has a whole

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:47.030
Caption: bunch of instructions in it that I

00:26:44.739 --> 00:26:49.250
Caption: didn&#39;t show because it&#39;s fine print but

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:52.820
Caption: basically to show you how little the

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:55.670
Caption: work is put in a date how many stories

00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:58.279
Caption: are remaining to be completed so you can

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:00.560
Caption: take it and I like how it says guests so

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:03.250
Caption: one of the team&#39;s I was working with did

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.960
Caption: a t-shirt size small medium large and so

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:07.920
Caption: they balanced it out depending on how

00:27:05.959 --> 00:27:10.949
Caption: many stories they thought something

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:13.260
Caption: breakdown into so a large at the low

00:27:10.949 --> 00:27:15.479
Caption: might be oh yeah we might break this up

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.570
Caption: into three stories a medium might be

00:27:15.479 --> 00:27:23.819
Caption: that could be a 2 A 1 a small would be 1

00:27:18.569 --> 00:27:27.479
Caption: &amp; 4 a high guess we did 5 3 1 or you

00:27:23.819 --> 00:27:30.569
Caption: could just put in a bit more of a guess

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:33.030
Caption: II guess and then there&#39;s a guess what

00:27:30.569 --> 00:27:34.559
Caption: your split rate is so another team I

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.989
Caption: worked with had had that where we

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.090
Caption: started out going we&#39;ve got no idea

00:27:36.989 --> 00:27:40.469
Caption: let&#39;s just say every story we have is

00:27:39.089 --> 00:27:41.729
Caption: going to turn into two stories when we

00:27:40.469 --> 00:27:44.640
Caption: start looking at it a little bit more

00:27:41.729 --> 00:27:47.040
Caption: and then we realized all that was that

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.959
Caption: was way off okay we need to get down a

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:52.489
Caption: little bit closer so we ended up with I

00:27:48.959 --> 00:27:56.849
Caption: think every story breaking up into 1.25

00:27:52.489 --> 00:27:58.709
Caption: then you tell it how many weeks or what

00:27:56.849 --> 00:28:01.109
Caption: your cycle is so this was the Kanban one

00:27:58.709 --> 00:28:04.890
Caption: one week if you were doing sprints it&#39;d

00:28:01.109 --> 00:28:07.770
Caption: be two weeks and then if you have got

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:10.500
Caption: your historical data so how many stories

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:13.800
Caption: you completed per iteration if you have

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.750
Caption: at least seven weeks worth of that then

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.980
Caption: that goes in a sheet as well which is so

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.479
Caption: boring I&#39;m not even going to show you

00:28:16.979 --> 00:28:21.030
Caption: because it&#39;s literally a column with

00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:24.689
Caption: number of stories completed in each cell

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:27.180
Caption: going back historically and if you do

00:28:24.689 --> 00:28:28.559
Caption: that you have data if you don&#39;t have

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.110
Caption: that like if you&#39;re just starting out

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.930
Caption: with a new team have a guess here&#39;s your

00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:37.920
Caption: locus here&#39;s your I guess that&#39;s all you

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:41.690
Caption: need to do and then whoa it produces

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:43.650
Caption: this wonderful red and the green

00:28:41.689 --> 00:28:45.959
Caption: delightful chart guaranteed to please

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:49.229
Caption: managers everywhere so what is this

00:28:45.959 --> 00:28:51.659
Caption: witchcraft it&#39;s actually running a Monte

00:28:49.229 --> 00:28:52.859
Caption: Carlo simulator behind the scenes with

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.020
Caption: no work on my part

00:28:52.859 --> 00:28:57.630
Caption: yes using statistics and probability to

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:59.130
Caption: help visualize the potential outcomes so

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:01.380
Caption: in this case the simulator is

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:03.239
Caption: forecasting how long it will take to

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.940
Caption: complete the features that we&#39;ve told it

00:29:03.239 --> 00:29:09.150
Caption: we have based on the data that I entered

00:29:05.939 --> 00:29:10.649
Caption: so strenuously in the previous screen so

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.869
Caption: using this information that

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.790
Caption: hypothetically completes the work 500

00:29:12.869 --> 00:29:17.369
Caption: times and then shows you the likelihood

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:18.750
Caption: of it finishing by date and in the

00:29:17.369 --> 00:29:20.428
Caption: spreadsheet itself it shows you all

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:22.829
Caption: kinds of whiz-bang graphs about how it

00:29:20.428 --> 00:29:24.569
Caption: was doing that and I went that&#39;s nice I

00:29:22.829 --> 00:29:26.518
Caption: don&#39;t really need to know how you came

00:29:24.569 --> 00:29:27.028
Caption: up with the numbers because this is

00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:29.070
Caption: awesome

00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:30.690
Caption: and after we used it a few times and

00:29:29.069 --> 00:29:33.298
Caption: found out that I was actually a

00:29:30.689 --> 00:29:35.428
Caption: reasonably good indicator people started

00:29:33.298 --> 00:29:37.378
Caption: having a bit more trust in it and it

00:29:35.428 --> 00:29:41.398
Caption: became my magical crystal ball

00:29:37.379 --> 00:29:43.979
Caption: prognosticator which was so valuable for

00:29:41.399 --> 00:29:46.200
Caption: such little effort like I just took some

00:29:43.979 --> 00:29:48.239
Caption: numbers that we already had in JIRA and

00:29:46.199 --> 00:29:50.939
Caption: entered them in a spreadsheet and it did

00:29:48.239 --> 00:29:52.918
Caption: it all the mess for me so what we ended

00:29:50.939 --> 00:29:55.829
Caption: up doing was creating estimates for

00:29:52.918 --> 00:29:57.418
Caption: confidence as well as time so again

00:29:55.829 --> 00:29:59.819
Caption: something Jeff Patton talks about is

00:29:57.418 --> 00:30:01.319
Caption: what&#39;s your bet level what would you bet

00:29:59.819 --> 00:30:02.908
Caption: would you bet your house that you&#39;re

00:30:01.319 --> 00:30:04.469
Caption: going to be finished would you bet your

00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:07.740
Caption: lunch you know how does that fit into

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:12.359
Caption: this you know and it&#39;s red yellow and

00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:14.519
Caption: green which management love okay so this

00:30:12.359 --> 00:30:17.158
Caption: is Troy McGinnis he&#39;s the person who set

00:30:14.519 --> 00:30:20.789
Caption: this up and as he says forecasting is

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:23.249
Caption: about answering questions to a

00:30:20.788 --> 00:30:25.678
Caption: transparent degree of certainty with as

00:30:23.249 --> 00:30:27.019
Caption: little effort as possible so he has made

00:30:25.678 --> 00:30:29.729
Caption: that effortless so it&#39;s simple

00:30:27.019 --> 00:30:32.399
Caption: transparent and provides an indicator of

00:30:29.729 --> 00:30:33.018
Caption: our predictability thanks Troy you&#39;re

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:37.190
Caption: awesome

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:40.619
Caption: okay so the TLDR

00:30:37.189 --> 00:30:44.579
Caption: deadlines happen try spending less time

00:30:40.619 --> 00:30:47.429
Caption: estimating not more use story mapping

00:30:44.579 --> 00:30:50.908
Caption: even in JIRA to help break up and

00:30:47.428 --> 00:30:52.768
Caption: visualize your work try using story

00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:56.309
Caption: counts instead of story points and just

00:30:52.769 --> 00:30:58.139
Caption: rule just reduces the the level of

00:30:56.308 --> 00:31:02.579
Caption: cognitive challenge that you&#39;re dealing

00:30:58.139 --> 00:31:04.499
Caption: with not code focus more on throughput

00:31:02.579 --> 00:31:07.258
Caption: in cycle time and less on velocity and

00:31:04.499 --> 00:31:11.669
Caption: then try the throughput forecaster to

00:31:07.259 --> 00:31:14.519
Caption: estimate confidence as well as time my

00:31:11.668 --> 00:31:16.168
Caption: disclaimer is that these are some other

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:17.450
Caption: things that we tried and they actually

00:31:16.168 --> 00:31:20.398
Caption: worked

00:31:17.449 --> 00:31:22.138
Caption: but everything&#39;s in context so please

00:31:20.399 --> 00:31:23.549
Caption: don&#39;t do the whole Spotify model thing I

00:31:22.139 --> 00:31:25.259
Caption: went to this conference and I was told

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:27.298
Caption: I&#39;m not agile unless I&#39;m I stopped using

00:31:25.259 --> 00:31:29.940
Caption: story points yep no don&#39;t have to do

00:31:27.298 --> 00:31:31.819
Caption: that what my goal was and this talk is

00:31:29.939 --> 00:31:33.258
Caption: to give you a few ideas and maybe

00:31:31.819 --> 00:31:35.349
Caption: hopefully some things you haven&#39;t seen

00:31:33.259 --> 00:31:39.619
Caption: before that you can try with your teams

00:31:35.349 --> 00:31:42.138
Caption: please do inspect in adapt and if you

00:31:39.619 --> 00:31:44.299
Caption: want to know more about how to manage

00:31:42.139 --> 00:31:46.249
Caption: your work in an agile way while still

00:31:44.298 --> 00:31:48.548
Caption: dealing with this when will it be done

00:31:46.249 --> 00:31:51.320
Caption: yet is it done is it done how about now
