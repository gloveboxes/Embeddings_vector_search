WEBVTT

00:00:05.028 --> 00:00:10.649
Caption: hello hello hello hello

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.659
Caption: welcome welcome back

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:14.909
Caption: so quite a few of you stay put which is

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:19.409
Caption: awesome Chris&#39;s talk that we just had in

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:20.520
Caption: here we sat down at the front on speaker

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:24.510
Caption: which obviously we really really

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.760
Caption: encourage TDD and following on we&#39;ve got

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.920
Caption: another first-time speaker as well and

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.349
Caption: this one&#39;s gonna be my favorite I don&#39;t

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.970
Caption: even know the topic no idea apparently

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.149
Caption: you&#39;re all doing tight bit wrong

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:40.350
Caption: okay so we&#39;ve started with that in mind

00:00:35.148 --> 00:00:44.128
Caption: so our next speaker is again ratify it&#39;s

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:46.409
Caption: definitely a ratified room one of our

00:00:44.129 --> 00:01:18.809
Caption: senior developers then Larry a big big

00:00:46.409 --> 00:01:20.130
Caption: round of applause please about me great

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:23.669
Caption: things you&#39;re doing wrong they&#39;re a lot

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:25.169
Caption: more but we&#39;re gonna breach what I&#39;m

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:28.830
Caption: gonna tell you what it is and what you

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:30.930
Caption: do instead it&#39;s all the way you have any

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.430
Caption: thing you want to say then get on

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:41.089
Caption: Twitter I won&#39;t respond to you right now

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:44.189
Caption: but I will get someone please Alex so

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:48.298
Caption: while he is talking well lets you add

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.460
Caption: optional type annotations to your code

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.659
Caption: to help describe the intent and stop me

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:56.220
Caption: from making mistakes so I can tell you

00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:59.328
Caption: when you&#39;ve got an inconsistency which

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.159
Caption: is like you&#39;re using a strange number

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.869
Caption: things like that and one of the core

00:02:02.158 --> 00:02:07.139
Caption: principles of talks is that all valid

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.130
Caption: JavaScript ballots on script so because

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:11.020
Caption: of that

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.820
Caption: a few little quirks did you get as well

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:22.059
Caption: because now toss crew probably saying it

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:25.420
Caption: but look this the only difference is the

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:30.270
Caption: popular section so this is our variable

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:37.179
Caption: if you wanted to to credit function and

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:38.500
Caption: argument and you can do so the first

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:41.559
Caption: thing people do wrong well that you&#39;re

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:51.820
Caption: using subscript is using any any in

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:55.330
Caption: general and basically are using any of

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.160
Caption: big tours of problems in Cosco so what

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.460
Caption: is any it&#39;s the most flexible type in

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.529
Caption: JavaScript and basically like you buy

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.670
Caption: layout of using stock script anymore I

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:11.830
Caption: need help

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:19.208
Caption: maybe unit out but I can&#39;t do that any

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:20.619
Caption: any value is open any because this is

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:35.070
Caption: where you get mistakes you don&#39;t realize

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:37.660
Caption: you&#39;re making so look an example so

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.670
Caption: throw the reasons have any and what&#39;s

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.350
Caption: good about it well it&#39;s easy to

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:42.789
Caption: prototype something you don&#39;t worry

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.160
Caption: about type annotations getting in the

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:54.189
Caption: way and things like that it&#39;s pure

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:56.529
Caption: JavaScript which I think with talk

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:05.680
Caption: scripts where it&#39;s statically done in

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:07.208
Caption: the free time we get into that yeah and

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:09.099
Caption: what&#39;s bad about it as I said it

00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:11.080
Caption: prevents the compiler from telling you

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.240
Caption: when you made a mistake and you need to

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.770
Caption: do all the work thank you

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.220
Caption: what do you think you&#39;ve got is actually

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.200
Caption: what you do have so so look an example

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.440
Caption: where this can cause the problem what&#39;s

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.580
Caption: that good a function adding two numbers

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.440
Caption: if I try and give it one of the

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:28.169
Caption: arguments string tots good will tell me

00:04:25.440 --> 00:05:23.450
Caption: that&#39;s a problem but if I have a

00:04:28.170 --> 00:05:25.380
Caption: variable so looking at an example in

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:31.500
Caption: this case don&#39;t know I&#39;ve got an object

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:36.720
Caption: I&#39;m just an empty object inside that

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.619
Caption: block or until that scope is a string so

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.410
Caption: we can still do all the normal things

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:44.339
Caption: like to uppercase or split noise kind of

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.779
Caption: things and outside that block there&#39;s

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:48.419
Caption: not a string so hopefully narrow the top

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:51.720
Caption: down from any or object or whatever it

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:55.680
Caption: might be to be a string or in other

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.920
Caption: words anything bottom string and if you

00:05:55.679 --> 00:06:00.089
Caption: do have in anytime

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.710
Caption: because you think that it could be any

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:03.899
Caption: function you&#39;re actually better off just

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:05.579
Caption: staying explicitly listening every

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:07.829
Caption: possible thing that could be so any is

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:09.199
Caption: really string or number or boy you know

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:11.689
Caption: object I&#39;ll

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.670
Caption: I don&#39;t know it&#39;s a bit annoying to

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.260
Caption: write that every time but if you do you

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.440
Caption: will actually get that start texting so

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.000
Caption: in this case the my string is a string

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:26.869
Caption: it was my variable

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:30.230
Caption: well tell you that number to do that

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:32.179
Caption: type checking first if you&#39;re one of the

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.779
Caption: lucky people who can use oxford three

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:38.359
Caption: which came out on Tuesday you can use

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:41.630
Caption: the new unknown which is kinda like a

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:43.069
Caption: type safe any so it&#39;s essentially the

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:54.320
Caption: same as that Union type I just showed

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:57.260
Caption: you the second thing people are doing

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.320
Caption: wrong is duplicating into places that

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.880
Caption: are related so this one may be gorilla

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.200
Caption: Danny but it&#39;s still something that can

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.010
Caption: cause a bit of frustration when you&#39;re

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.450
Caption: using talk scripts so when you came to

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.490
Caption: talk for a property name you need to

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:14.480
Caption: change every instance of that type of

00:07:10.489 --> 00:07:21.319
Caption: property home waiver is declared so you

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:23.120
Caption: won&#39;t get right back to help thing and

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.779
Caption: basically you could even have errors

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:33.979
Caption: just because you changed apart so when

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:40.940
Caption: you change it then you have to change

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:42.860
Caption: your interface and you can even have

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.839
Caption: errors that are only actually problems

00:07:42.859 --> 00:07:46.839
Caption: with the implementation so the type of

00:07:47.019 --> 00:07:51.349
Caption: implementation for example if you&#39;re

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.940
Caption: using react and you want to render

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.980
Caption: something you say it&#39;s a stranger than

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.690
Caption: here comes a number so just still valid

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.029
Caption: things to render in react but your talks

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.559
Caption: with right so you get extra errors then

00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:05.119
Caption: it&#39;s more hassle to go through them and

00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:11.600
Caption: then lastly this is like typing that so

00:08:05.119 --> 00:08:14.359
Caption: this is example of react labeled input

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.369
Caption: and an input so you can see that the

00:08:14.359 --> 00:08:18.909
Caption: basically the same the labeled input

00:08:16.369 --> 00:08:20.769
Caption: takes your label

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.089
Caption: and then if I render them in react you

00:08:20.769 --> 00:08:25.539
Caption: never use reactive probably doesn&#39;t

00:08:22.089 --> 00:08:27.910
Caption: matter it&#39;s just an example but you can

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.760
Caption: see that we passed through the proper to

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:34.679
Caption: the input from the labeling place so

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:40.059
Caption: they&#39;re related and they should be

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:42.098
Caption: related decide that when I&#39;m using my

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:43.779
Caption: labeled input I don&#39;t like getting the

00:08:42.098 --> 00:08:49.440
Caption: event that I&#39;d rather get just the value

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:49.440
Caption: that is emitted and I changed the event

00:08:51.869 --> 00:08:57.880
Caption: then great you can change I go back to

00:08:56.229 --> 00:09:02.859
Caption: my interface and I see that I&#39;ve got an

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:05.650
Caption: arrow so alright that promise gonna go

00:09:02.859 --> 00:09:07.390
Caption: back and look at my interface and then I

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:10.360
Caption: go alright input prop so change that one

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:11.619
Caption: too and then you again and they say

00:09:10.359 --> 00:09:13.329
Caption: you&#39;ve got an issue with the on change

00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:18.669
Caption: now let&#39;s actually the issue that&#39;s

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:20.820
Caption: where you&#39;ve got the mistake we had an

00:09:18.669 --> 00:09:23.769
Caption: extra layer on the way

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:27.450
Caption: so what&#39;s me to instead there are few

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:29.380
Caption: options we can extend the interface

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.970
Caption: basically say that the labeling foot

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.789
Caption: extends simple props with an extra

00:09:30.969 --> 00:09:35.559
Caption: property called label to me that seems

00:09:33.789 --> 00:09:39.039
Caption: like the parent being defined by the

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:41.770
Caption: child so not my favorite I prefer to use

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:45.779
Caption: the subscript map types in this example

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:49.739
Caption: pick pick basically lets you take the

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:54.580
Caption: from one property with these canines and

00:09:49.739 --> 00:09:56.200
Caption: use that sorry whichever way you do it

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.730
Caption: you&#39;ll get your tight changes pointing

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.470
Caption: through automatically and you&#39;ll see the

00:09:57.729 --> 00:10:03.339
Caption: errors for the implementation not first

00:09:59.469 --> 00:10:05.259
Caption: time so a little bit about thick like I

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.360
Caption: said it lets you pick some properties

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.570
Caption: off the type one thing I always forget

00:10:07.359 --> 00:10:13.119
Caption: to do Oh mistake always make is we went

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:15.700
Caption: on separating the property names that

00:10:13.119 --> 00:10:19.029
Caption: strings by using coma and it goes me mo

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:20.350
Caption: Tonio for that so I use a pipe and

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.020
Caption: hopefully someone will remember that and

00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:24.250
Caption: maybe I&#39;ll remember that

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.750
Caption: so there&#39;s no the map plots they come

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.429
Caption: built-in with Todd scripts there&#39;s

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.359
Caption: read-only which is really useful if you

00:10:27.429 --> 00:10:32.179
Caption: want something to be immutable

00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:35.328
Caption: it takes the talks that you&#39;ve got but

00:10:32.179 --> 00:10:48.799
Caption: adds a read-only keyword inside of it

00:10:35.328 --> 00:10:53.659
Caption: essentially so you helped you with a new

00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:55.639
Caption: one and that can be useful to different

00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:58.609
Caption: types so we&#39;ll give you the keys that

00:10:55.638 --> 00:11:01.578
Caption: are in one but not the other that can be

00:10:58.609 --> 00:11:03.588
Caption: good the third thing people do wrong is

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:05.148
Caption: not taking advantage of toxic compiler

00:11:03.588 --> 00:11:06.619
Caption: options this is probably bigger than the

00:11:05.148 --> 00:11:07.508
Caption: second one but I want at the end of it

00:11:06.619 --> 00:11:10.670
Caption: of thing

00:11:07.508 --> 00:11:13.188
Caption: so you see you can pile our options in

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:15.248
Caption: your case come things like Jason well we

00:11:13.189 --> 00:11:19.759
Caption: don&#39;t looking at that often I don&#39;t but

00:11:15.249 --> 00:11:21.739
Caption: good thing first one in strict mode now

00:11:19.758 --> 00:11:24.109
Caption: this is on by default when you start a

00:11:21.739 --> 00:11:25.639
Caption: new task or project if you don&#39;t really

00:11:24.109 --> 00:11:30.729
Caption: have a sales company Dutch boy when you

00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:30.729
Caption: run can see in it at least if you don&#39;t

00:11:35.588 --> 00:11:41.258
Caption: but strict mode gives you a whole lot of

00:11:37.849 --> 00:11:44.448
Caption: extra stuff so two of the options are

00:11:41.258 --> 00:11:46.789
Caption: unknown for Danny which is autumn or

00:11:44.448 --> 00:11:50.298
Caption: about and strict no kicks which also

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:52.698
Caption: talk a bit more about these other ones

00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:56.898
Caption: trig function types and whatever they&#39;re

00:11:52.698 --> 00:11:59.328
Caption: also useful but big holy most easy

00:11:56.898 --> 00:12:01.159
Caption: strict mode and you&#39;ll be fine and these

00:11:59.328 --> 00:12:03.828
Caption: other ones they&#39;re not part of the

00:12:01.159 --> 00:12:05.778
Caption: strict things but they helped me find

00:12:03.828 --> 00:12:12.708
Caption: bugs and unused locals or implicit

00:12:05.778 --> 00:12:15.258
Caption: returns so no equipted any no one puts

00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:17.359
Caption: it any is a big deal because like I said

00:12:15.258 --> 00:12:20.778
Caption: before when you use any you&#39;re accepting

00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:25.489
Caption: the risk and basically went our Krypton

00:12:20.778 --> 00:12:27.438
Caption: and further cut because it can&#39;t figure

00:12:25.489 --> 00:12:30.470
Caption: it out then it will give you a default

00:12:27.439 --> 00:12:32.779
Caption: implicit any and that means you don&#39;t

00:12:30.469 --> 00:12:34.368
Caption: realize they&#39;re accepting the risk so

00:12:32.778 --> 00:12:36.828
Caption: when you have this compiler option set

00:12:34.369 --> 00:12:37.940
Caption: and you have any posted any you&#39;ll get

00:12:36.828 --> 00:12:39.739
Caption: an error

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:43.130
Caption: right on the line on your thing and all

00:12:39.739 --> 00:12:48.049
Caption: say no argument first implicitly hasn&#39;t

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:51.320
Caption: any type or integrity of the place any

00:12:48.049 --> 00:12:52.640
Caption: thought so all you need to do if you

00:12:51.320 --> 00:13:01.309
Caption: think you haven&#39;t anything it just put

00:12:52.640 --> 00:13:03.530
Caption: the annotation no chicks as anyone heard

00:13:01.309 --> 00:13:09.109
Caption: of the billion dollar mistake this is

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:11.030
Caption: Tony Hoare was making a type system or

00:13:09.109 --> 00:13:15.079
Caption: Algol W which I&#39;ve never heard of and

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:16.010
Caption: don&#39;t really want to use but he was the

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:19.130
Caption: first card about a null reference

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:21.369
Caption: exception and in 2009 he said that he

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:28.849
Caption: thinks it&#39;s cause the billion dollars of

00:13:21.369 --> 00:13:31.190
Caption: damage so javascript has to go into no

00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:34.479
Caption: there&#39;s no and under time so you can say

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:36.500
Caption: that javascript is going go on mistake

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:38.479
Caption: so stricken objects will hope you get

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.510
Caption: around this so it&#39;ll force you to

00:13:38.479 --> 00:13:44.959
Caption: annotate when something could be no and

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:46.220
Caption: then based on that it will make sure

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:53.780
Caption: that when you&#39;re using it you&#39;re

00:13:46.219 --> 00:13:58.219
Caption: checking that it&#39;s not know how did we

00:13:53.780 --> 00:14:00.140
Caption: get here at all well it&#39;s important to

00:13:58.219 --> 00:14:02.269
Caption: remember that talk scripts isn&#39;t

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.350
Caption: actually a language that anything knows

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.239
Caption: about that your editor

00:14:03.349 --> 00:14:06.500
Caption: you generally compile it all the way and

00:14:05.239 --> 00:14:08.839
Caption: you&#39;re just running JavaScript for the

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.190
Caption: browser so if you&#39;ve ever said the

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.780
Caption: compiler will handle that for me or

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.000
Caption: that&#39;ll never happen then you could have

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.350
Caption: some of these issues and it&#39;s important

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.640
Caption: to remember there&#39;s no runtime type

00:14:15.349 --> 00:14:18.829
Caption: checking so just because you said

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.900
Caption: something to be a number doesn&#39;t mean it

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.540
Caption: is it&#39;s especially important when you&#39;re

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.530
Caption: working with like third parties it&#39;s

00:14:23.539 --> 00:14:26.690
Caption: written if I don&#39;t have any type

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:29.630
Caption: annotations you might think it&#39;s a

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:31.760
Caption: string but is it really so you can add

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.690
Caption: those type of checks in places that make

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.010
Caption: sense you know you don&#39;t wanna go to

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:38.659
Caption: literally a code within one every single

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:40.220
Caption: function but it&#39;s important but you

00:14:38.659 --> 00:14:43.969
Caption: don&#39;t know what you&#39;re getting you can

00:14:40.219 --> 00:14:45.079
Caption: do those checks and I&#39;m nine type well

00:14:43.969 --> 00:14:46.729
Caption: for that you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.139
Caption: getting and

00:14:46.729 --> 00:14:52.338
Caption: compiler will actually force you to do

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:54.190
Caption: that you any worry so to recap the three

00:14:52.338 --> 00:14:56.528
Caption: things not to do

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:59.088
Caption: remember those risky to you Danny and

00:14:56.528 --> 00:15:01.219
Caption: use something else instead so unknown

00:14:59.088 --> 00:15:03.049
Caption: all the big Union you probably actually

00:15:01.219 --> 00:15:05.539
Caption: have all of them you&#39;ve probably got

00:15:03.049 --> 00:15:08.000
Caption: let&#39;s say the spring or a number in

00:15:05.539 --> 00:15:11.299
Caption: which case that&#39;s a lot less tie things

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.208
Caption: and the whole thing map flux are better

00:15:11.299 --> 00:15:19.268
Caption: than duplicating interfaces Rolex code

00:15:14.208 --> 00:15:22.250
Caption: and you way as if there is to go through

00:15:19.268 --> 00:15:23.419
Caption: Turner&#39;s prick mode that&#39;s a big one

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.880
Caption: that will help you find a lot of

00:15:23.419 --> 00:15:30.169
Caption: problems and remember it&#39;s doing

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:32.690
Caption: JavaScript now if there&#39;s anything else

00:15:30.169 --> 00:15:34.609
Caption: I&#39;ve missed or anything you&#39;ve seen that

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:38.989
Caption: people do wrong or that I&#39;ve got wrong

00:15:34.609 --> 00:15:48.768
Caption: then tweet me you past activity or no

00:15:38.989 --> 00:15:50.659
Caption: any my favorite yeah then you know got a

00:15:48.768 --> 00:15:51.559
Caption: few raisins besides you get sent out so

00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:52.879
Caption: that&#39;s fine

00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:54.859
Caption: so it&#39;s three about things I&#39;m talking

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:59.828
Caption: about next for things you might think

00:15:54.859 --> 00:15:59.828
Caption: are interesting and other man thank you

00:16:04.719 --> 00:16:11.500
Caption: love your work right that was absolutely

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:13.508
Caption: brilliant and thanks guys big and also

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.429
Caption: bourget&#39;s now we&#39;ve actually got the

00:16:13.508 --> 00:16:16.119
Caption: luxury of having to three minutes for

00:16:15.429 --> 00:16:28.148
Caption: some questions

00:16:16.119 --> 00:16:31.378
Caption: so that&#39;s a no yeah I&#39;ve got one down

00:16:28.148 --> 00:16:31.378
Caption: the front awesome coming to you

00:16:54.969 --> 00:17:15.798
Caption: it&#39;s basically the same as so basically

00:17:13.038 --> 00:17:18.349
Caption: let you do things like union types which

00:17:15.798 --> 00:17:38.269
Caption: is both separated by the pipe so I might

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:45.199
Caption: say yeah yeah so I might have something

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:46.729
Caption: like an expiry date type and rather than

00:17:45.199 --> 00:17:48.048
Caption: have to clear that everywhere and say

00:17:46.729 --> 00:17:49.819
Caption: this is actually a novel thing hasn&#39;t

00:17:48.048 --> 00:17:53.269
Caption: been once file you just say that it&#39;s

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:55.130
Caption: date or no and then I can use that

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:57.020
Caption: expiry date to opera have an expiry date

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:59.000
Caption: and I don&#39;t know worry about the null

00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:05.080
Caption: I&#39;m taking everywhere I can you know

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.369
Caption: that way so that&#39;s or if you want to

00:18:05.079 --> 00:18:09.769
Caption: take props and walkable places you can

00:18:07.369 --> 00:18:33.349
Caption: do intersection so I might have another

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:35.589
Caption: one that&#39;s all the properties so it&#39;s a

00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:39.219
Caption: way of joining two things together or

00:18:35.589 --> 00:18:39.219
Caption: everything types as well

00:18:42.319 --> 00:18:45.508
Caption: or the one with obvious

00:18:44.219 --> 00:19:03.808
Caption: probably things up there like cooking

00:18:45.509 --> 00:19:05.220
Caption: spray or something on that yeah yeah so

00:19:03.808 --> 00:19:09.719
Caption: you can export types anything about that

00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:13.349
Caption: as well but yeah I always or in this

00:19:09.719 --> 00:19:15.719
Caption: case thanks Ben

00:19:13.349 --> 00:19:17.009
Caption: so when I lied we haven&#39;t got any more

00:19:15.719 --> 00:19:19.229
Caption: time for any more questions because that

00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:20.039
Caption: was more of a conversation so thank you

00:19:19.229 --> 00:19:22.558
Caption: very very much

00:19:20.038 --> 00:19:24.459
Caption: and another feet round of applause but

00:19:22.558 --> 00:19:27.578
Caption: then Larry please

00:19:24.459 --> 00:19:27.578
Caption: [Applause]
