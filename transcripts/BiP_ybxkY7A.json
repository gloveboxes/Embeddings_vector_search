  "description": "In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger put a (hypothetical!) cat in a box. With a vile poison and some quantum magic, we were forced to the conclusion that the cat was both alive and dead at the same time. Over 80 years later, it is either one impressive cat or it is surely dead. I will resurrect Schrodinger\u0027s cat and discuss the implications of and on the famous thought experiment from the perspective of the recently developed fields of quantum information and computation, but not before showing you how we can share such seemingly complex concepts even to children!\\n\\nKeynote\\nChris Ferrie is an Associate Professor at the University of Technology Sydney and the Centre for Quantum Software and Information. His research interests include quantum learning and control. He obtained his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the Institute for Quantum Computing and University of Waterloo (Canada) in 2012. Chris\u2019s passion for communicating science has led from the most esoteric topics of mathematical physics to more recently writing children\u2019s books, such as Quantum Physics for Babies, and a whole collection of other titles that make science accessible even for the youngest children."
