00:00:07.428 --> 00:00:12.840
Caption: I&#39;m gonna start my talk though somewhere

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:19.859
Caption: iStopMotion when talks which is I suffer

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.359
Caption: from an anxiety PTSD and which might

00:00:19.858 --> 00:00:22.889
Caption: surprise people because I&#39;m standing in

00:00:21.358 --> 00:00:26.038
Caption: front of the room talking and doing

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:28.500
Caption: public speaking but for me this is the

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:33.270
Caption: safest space in the room because I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.549
Caption: closer to the exit the other reason is I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.010
Caption: can actually feel a lot more in control

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:39.930
Caption: of the room and I don&#39;t have to go up to

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.479
Caption: people one-to-one and introduce myself

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.599
Caption: because I really hate small talk so

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:48.328
Caption: quickly so this is how I manage walking

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:50.128
Caption: in a room and today I&#39;m talking about

00:00:48.328 --> 00:00:53.519
Caption: being underestimated of being an

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.050
Caption: indivisible leader and first of all I&#39;m

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.719
Caption: going to explain where this talk came

00:00:55.049 --> 00:01:00.840
Caption: from so like with most things it came

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.879
Caption: from a conversation and it&#39;s a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.209
Caption: conversation that I often have with

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.020
Caption: people who are in the tech space or in

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:13.919
Caption: business who don&#39;t feel they are a

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:16.978
Caption: leader who also feel they&#39;re

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:23.339
Caption: disadvantaged who often feel like

00:01:16.978 --> 00:01:26.469
Caption: they&#39;re one or two women or people of

00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:29.969
Caption: color within an organization

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:34.270
Caption: and so they feel like the game is real

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.639
Caption: and the conversations go somewhere along

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:41.289
Caption: the lines of it is a position of power

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:46.559
Caption: to be the most invisible person in the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.930
Caption: room because you get to observe people

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:55.930
Caption: when you&#39;re invisible you get to see how

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:58.839
Caption: others treat others good or bad and you

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.919
Caption: get to make a decision as to whether or

00:01:58.839 --> 00:02:04.539
Caption: not you&#39;re going to take these people

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:07.389
Caption: with you because despite all the

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.389
Caption: challenges you might have whether or not

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:15.639
Caption: in the gender race accessibility

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:17.229
Caption: eventually you will get them and when

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:22.690
Caption: you do you get to make a decision as to

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:24.610
Caption: who you take with you so I thought

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.449
Caption: leadership for a really long time

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.869
Caption: was this straight line pump and then I

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:36.580
Caption: discovered that it wasn&#39;t and in some

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:40.080
Caption: cases I went backwards the blue line is

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.080
Caption: my leadership

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:48.979
Caption: that set stages in my business in my

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.699
Caption: life I would get to a manager role and

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:59.098
Caption: then I would be told I was too ugly to

00:02:53.699 --> 00:03:02.220
Caption: be laid up all that I wasn&#39;t good enough

00:02:59.098 --> 00:03:04.470
Caption: at my job or didn&#39;t look very normal I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.410
Caption: needed to be more normal and you should

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.819
Caption: just have normal hair maybe should turn

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.970
Caption: it down and the fun pile of that is is I

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.899
Caption: need to take that advice I&#39;m a little

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:23.040
Caption: bit of a rebel one of the things I

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:28.939
Caption: discovered in leadership was it&#39;s a fine

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:28.939
Caption: line between fearlessness and stupidity

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.220
Caption: and a lot of the time we actually

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:42.179
Caption: self-sabotage when we get knees success

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.399
Caption: so because I spent so much time

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:47.369
Caption: observing people I also observe fact

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:49.919
Caption: that it&#39;s not the fear of failure all

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:52.709
Caption: the time but sometimes it&#39;s the fear of

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:58.619
Caption: success because we don&#39;t feel like with

00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:00.420
Caption: many in fact when people asked me are

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:03.000
Caption: you scared that you&#39;re going to fail I

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.520
Caption: was like nope failure and I really good

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.270
Caption: friends we know each other really well

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:15.930
Caption: like benefits success however terrified

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.080
Caption: me what would happen in success was I

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:20.639
Caption: get close to success and then I&#39;d run

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.970
Caption: heck to palliate because it was a lot

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.970
Caption: easier

00:04:26.489 --> 00:04:30.000
Caption: some of you in the room we&#39;ve already

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.080
Caption: heard a part of my Jenny and part of my

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.739
Caption: story and part of my story is in things

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:38.189
Caption: like hobbies to confess 17 years of my

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:39.598
Caption: life

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.569
Caption: I grew up in an extremely violent

00:04:39.598 --> 00:04:43.910
Caption: environment and it was homeless by the

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.139
Caption: time I was 17

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.860
Caption: not because I ran away from home but

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:53.669
Caption: because of economic situations by the

00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:56.388
Caption: time I would get to 32 my fiancee died

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.389
Caption: in a motorcycle accident

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:02.729
Caption: for all intents purposes I shouldn&#39;t be

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:05.369
Caption: in a role of leadership I shouldn&#39;t be

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.300
Caption: seeing you in the company according to

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:08.299

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:19.210
Caption: journey to get you you don&#39;t have to sup

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:20.529
Caption: up in order to be a leader because

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:23.440
Caption: leadership isn&#39;t actually about

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:27.010
Caption: suffering or being a mother it&#39;s about

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:29.589

Caption: hand up rather than a handout

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:41.899
Caption: so these are the things I look for in

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.429
Caption: visible leaders for the people that I&#39;m

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:45.790

00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:53.388
Caption: conversation a few years ago when I

00:09:49.698 --> 00:09:54.948
Caption: believe I wasn&#39;t a feminist I was

00:09:53.388 --> 00:09:58.248

00:09:54.948 --> 00:10:01.909

00:09:58.249 --> 00:10:04.449
Caption: pointed out to me that when a manager of

00:10:01.909 --> 00:10:08.919

Caption: just haven&#39;t realized it I just kept

00:10:19.789 --> 00:10:23.929
Caption: going because my version of dealing with

00:10:22.219 --> 00:10:56.958
Caption: fear is to feel with the air you do it

00:10:23.929 --> 00:10:58.848
Caption: anyway down I think I&#39;ve spent an

00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:04.388
Caption: enormous amount of time stressing about

00:10:58.848 --> 00:11:08.179
Caption: things that I had no control over or I

00:11:04.388 --> 00:11:10.488
Caption: just didn&#39;t feel I was worthy of and so

00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:15.639
Caption: I would fight a lot of the time with

00:11:10.489 --> 00:11:15.639
Caption: myself more than anybody else and I just

00:11:29.828 --> 00:11:36.008
Caption: what - please tell him - now this video

00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:39.220
Caption: so each time I reach a point where a

00:11:36.008 --> 00:11:41.258
Caption: growing business and I freak out and

00:11:39.219 --> 00:11:43.208
Caption: it&#39;s getting a lot lesser and a lot

00:11:41.258 --> 00:11:45.368
Caption: smaller than it used to be but it used

00:11:43.208 --> 00:11:46.568
Caption: to be over just self-sabotaging sending

00:11:45.369 --> 00:11:52.179
Caption: invoices because I didn&#39;t think it was

00:11:46.568 --> 00:11:53.798
Caption: worthy of money and now I&#39;ve got any

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:58.480
Caption: growth at the moment so I&#39;ve got a team

00:11:53.799 --> 00:11:59.648
Caption: I have five people that I employ now and

00:11:58.479 --> 00:12:02.798
Caption: it freaks me out

00:11:59.648 --> 00:12:06.368
Caption: each time the growth so yeah at the

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:08.350
Caption: moment it&#39;s just when you grow you have

00:12:06.369 --> 00:12:12.160
Caption: different problems and when you&#39;re so

00:12:08.349 --> 00:12:14.919
Caption: small at the moment it&#39;s actually

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:16.448
Caption: probably delegation and handing stuff to

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:18.128
Caption: somebody else because I feel like I have

00:12:16.448 --> 00:12:21.359
Caption: to do it all because if I don&#39;t do it

00:12:18.129 --> 00:12:21.360
Caption: all then am I really working

00:12:27.169 --> 00:12:34.028
Caption: favorite sound self-gravity

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:36.388
Caption: naps and just it just getting tuned for

00:12:34.028 --> 00:12:36.388
Caption: my technology

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:47.070
Caption: how do you find a feeling of Southfork

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:52.800
Caption: sorry how do you find that mention a lot

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:54.720
Caption: about feeling worthy um a lot of it

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:57.239
Caption: comes from old stories from my childhood

00:12:54.719 --> 00:12:59.849
Caption: and figuring out what the recourse of

00:12:57.239 --> 00:13:02.489
Caption: those stories our brains like to create

00:12:59.849 --> 00:13:06.089
Caption: a lot of evidence that our stories are

00:13:02.489 --> 00:13:08.429
Caption: real and so if part of your story is I&#39;m

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:11.580
Caption: not worthy I&#39;m not worthy you&#39;ll go and

00:13:08.429 --> 00:13:15.239
Caption: seek out that evidence all the time and

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:17.100
Caption: I think so one of the mental kind of

00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:19.529
Caption: mental hacks and trying to hack thinking

00:13:17.099 --> 00:13:22.799
Caption: simply it so I think overcome them

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:24.810
Caption: and one of them is rather than seeking

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:27.419
Caption: out self-worth acknowledge and accept

00:13:24.809 --> 00:13:30.200
Caption: that I already have it and then find

00:13:27.419 --> 00:13:33.119
Caption: evidence that how it shows up for me

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.070
Caption: because the opposite evidence is always

00:13:33.119 --> 00:13:36.539
Caption: there it&#39;s just you&#39;re not looking there

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:39.780
Caption: because we all like to look at the train

00:13:36.539 --> 00:13:41.669
Caption: wreck so especially when you&#39;ve grown up

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:45.110
Caption: so for me I grew up in the environment

00:13:41.669 --> 00:13:48.299
Caption: where yeah self-worth was non-existent

00:13:45.109 --> 00:13:53.539
Caption: so for me it&#39;s just constantly going how

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:53.539
Caption: I show today narrative sent me a message

00:13:55.099 --> 00:13:59.419
Caption: she&#39;s gonna be like she doesn&#39;t love me

00:14:00.289 --> 00:14:07.229
Caption: like I now that used to take a month or

00:14:04.619 --> 00:14:09.270
Caption: three months out of my life where I

00:14:07.229 --> 00:14:11.579
Caption: would stress out and get

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:15.119
Caption: get really worked up on this little

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:22.980
Caption: agreement that I made and then now it

00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:25.559
Caption: takes me maybe but it was acknowledging

00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:28.139
Caption: that that situation was not my childhood

00:14:25.559 --> 00:14:30.989
Caption: situation she&#39;s not to know how is she

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.130
Caption: know she wasn&#39;t there and so because

00:14:30.989 --> 00:14:34.169
Caption: that&#39;s what we do is we build the

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.479
Caption: evidence and then we take that for each

00:14:34.169 --> 00:14:43.829
Caption: situation to the next one

00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:47.269
Caption: so we&#39;ve almost got it disrupt how can I

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:59.520
Caption: like existing leaders help support and

00:14:47.270 --> 00:15:02.489
Caption: champion and it&#39;s safe for that so I

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.200
Caption: think it&#39;s it&#39;s so first of all it&#39;s

00:15:02.489 --> 00:15:08.070
Caption: about encouragement so for me it&#39;s the

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:10.590
Caption: conversation I have with them about it&#39;s

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:14.100
Caption: okay that you&#39;re not a leader yet but

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:16.080
Caption: here&#39;s all the ways you can be and in

00:15:14.099 --> 00:15:18.839
Caption: fact you are actually already a leader

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.760
Caption: and here&#39;s how and giving them the

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:24.390
Caption: demonstration of the fact that you know

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:26.729
Caption: that whole invisible nests of being an

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:30.239
Caption: invisible leader is that you do get to

00:15:26.729 --> 00:15:32.159
Caption: observe you do get to observe people in

00:15:30.239 --> 00:15:36.690
Caption: because when you&#39;re invisible people

00:15:32.159 --> 00:15:39.169
Caption: don&#39;t wear their masks so tightly when

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:41.250
Caption: they don&#39;t think they&#39;re being watched

00:15:39.169 --> 00:15:45.269
Caption: and when they do I think that the person

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:46.530
Caption: who&#39;s watching them is important I write

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.150
Caption: an article a little while back only

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:51.180
Caption: thing which was dear old white guy who

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:52.740
Caption: told me to get a joke to them and I

00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:53.820
Caption: preface it in the first paragraph going

00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:55.260
Caption: ok I&#39;m not talking a little the white

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.160
Caption: bone white guys who reminded my coffee

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.770
Caption: slate you&#39;re cool because you&#39;re

00:15:56.159 --> 00:16:00.329
Caption: connected to me but only otherwise all

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.989
Caption: my guys in this particular one who

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:05.730
Caption: decided one day it warps neck like

00:16:02.989 --> 00:16:07.039
Caption: opposing of crossing the street you told

00:16:05.729 --> 00:16:11.489
Caption: me to go and get a job because

00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:14.789
Caption: apparently I look homeless I wrote an

00:16:11.489 --> 00:16:17.909
Caption: article response to go and it was an

00:16:14.789 --> 00:16:20.130
Caption: acknowledgement to say you&#39;re so funny

00:16:17.909 --> 00:16:24.209
Caption: so funny that you think your opinion

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:26.640
Caption: it&#39;s for something yeah and I sort of

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:28.380
Caption: acknowledged how far we&#39;ve come

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:32.070
Caption: like I talk on the radio I&#39;m in the main

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:34.739
Caption: ii-era I talked until 950 years ago that

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:36.660
Caption: would not have happened I would not have

00:16:34.739 --> 00:16:39.659
Caption: had those opportunities presented to me

00:16:36.659 --> 00:16:41.099
Caption: and so it was an acknowledgement and a

00:16:39.659 --> 00:16:44.459
Caption: gratitude for everything that I&#39;ve

00:16:41.099 --> 00:16:46.049
Caption: achieved to date and that&#39;s a good

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:49.369
Caption: question to ask them is what are you

00:16:46.049 --> 00:16:52.859
Caption: grateful for what do you learn so far

00:16:49.369 --> 00:16:56.489
Caption: because people get when they come across

00:16:52.859 --> 00:16:58.769
Caption: the narcissistic sake boss especially

00:16:56.489 --> 00:17:04.319
Caption: they feel disarmed and disabled in the

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:08.359
Caption: workplace and so advise them it&#39;s ok you

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:08.359
Caption: get to be an observer in this situation

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.479

00:17:54.760 --> 00:18:00.579
Caption: of yourself like I&#39;m quite a loud person

00:17:58.359 --> 00:18:02.079
Caption: we don&#39;t have quite people pointing and

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:03.399
Caption: I always say the moment need you to show

00:18:02.079 --> 00:18:05.229
Caption: up any differently than what you&#39;re

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.800
Caption: doing you know how you&#39;re showing us

00:18:05.229 --> 00:18:10.150
Caption: he&#39;s actually perfect and how they

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.980
Caption: communicate is figuring out how they

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:15.880
Caption: communicate if there are quiet person

00:18:11.979 --> 00:18:19.059
Caption: how else today so as a leader in that

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.959
Caption: position are they like other global

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:22.020
Caption: communicators are they written

00:18:19.959 --> 00:18:24.159
Caption: communicators are they good listeners

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.330
Caption: people who don&#39;t tend to be very loud

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.630
Caption: and very good at this me

00:18:26.329 --> 00:18:31.880
Caption: and that&#39;s a valuable skill and pointing

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:34.760
Caption: out that putting out those skills look

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:38.329
Caption: like I&#39;ve got a person a transgender man

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:40.459
Caption: on my team who&#39;s an introvert and also

00:18:38.329 --> 00:18:42.589
Caption: suffers from really bad situational

00:18:40.459 --> 00:18:44.809
Caption: anxiety doesn&#39;t like to leave his house

00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:47.029
Caption: but the drive commute from his house to

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:51.170
Caption: the office is very very stressful for

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:53.719
Caption: him but how he shows up is all the

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:55.880
Caption: content he creates his beautiful and

00:18:53.719 --> 00:18:57.049
Caption: it&#39;s reminding him that he doesn&#39;t

00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.020
Caption: actually have to show up in any other

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:02.030
Caption: place there&#39;s no other expectation from

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.290
Caption: him around that and that a mystic that&#39;s

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.390
Caption: the thing is for managing those

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:08.800
Caption: expectations because sometimes when you

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.800
Caption: have a big team for bad people

00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:32.369
Caption: I was really looking forward

00:19:18.089 --> 00:19:34.260
Caption: I miss challenges myself their biggest

00:19:32.369 --> 00:19:37.949
Caption: challenge has been in overcoming my own

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:41.779
Caption: internal thoughts around the situation&#39;s

00:19:37.949 --> 00:19:44.819
Caption: I think one of the things I say in my to

00:19:41.779 --> 00:19:47.400
Caption: help he&#39;s a little loudspeaker to our

00:19:44.819 --> 00:19:50.189
Caption: heads and broadcast whatever was going

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:53.789
Caption: on in our heads we would never say those

00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:57.119
Caption: things to another human being why is it

00:19:53.788 --> 00:20:02.148
Caption: okay that we say it to ourselves and a

00:19:57.119 --> 00:20:02.149
Caption: lot of my challenge has been realized

00:20:15.489 --> 00:20:18.699
