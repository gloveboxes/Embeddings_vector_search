  "description": "Microservice architectures provide some amazing benefits for scale, fault tolerance, and the ability to build teams quickly if necessary. \\n\\nHowever too many teams seem to get caught up in the tech stack, and the results can be disastrous. While diving in with Docker, Kubernetes, OpenAPI, centralised logging, and other fun tools, it\u2019s easy to forget about design.\\n\\nThis talk will cover some common pitfalls and anti-patterns seen in the real world, as well as how to apply some Domain Driven Design concepts such as Bounded Contexts at an architectural level. By modelling your domain better we can solve a host of problems before they happen, and give your next project a much better chance at success.\\n\\nMostly intermediate\\n45 mins\\nBackend Development\\nDamian Maclennan is an experienced software architect, developer, trainer, and agile engineering consultant.\\n\\nIn his 20 year career he has designed software architecture for companies of all sizes, been a CTO for early stage startups, developed and run high profile and high traffic websites, as well as mentored and trained hundreds of developers.\\n\\nThroughout this time he has developed deep expertise on the architectural patterns, engineering techniques, and team dynamics needed to make successful software."
