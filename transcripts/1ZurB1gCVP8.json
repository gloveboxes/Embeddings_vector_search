  "description": "Queues are bad, but software developers love them. The problem with queues is they are binary, either they\u0027re full or empty. You\u0027d think they would magically fix any overload or failure problem. But they don\u0027t, and bring with them a bunch of their own problems.\\n\\nHear a war-story about how naive assumptions and over-optimism caused a near week-long ongoing outage.\\n\\nLearn about some of the reasons why queues are not a one-size fits all solution, and how there is no such thing as a good queue, only one that is absolutely necessary. Queues are in more places than you think, and they can bite you in ways that you wont expect.\\n\\nAre you building event sourced systems with process managers and read model populators? Are you working with serverless? This session is for you.\\n\\nI am a Software Developer with over 7 years of experience building highly-scalable distributed systems. I\u0027m an advocate for modern design patterns and architectures such as Domain Driven Design, Event Sourcing and CQRS. I am also passionate about mentoring and volunteering my time to helping others grow."
