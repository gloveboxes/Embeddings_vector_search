00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.619
Caption: please just hold tight we&#39;ll get started

00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:11.340
Caption: perfect

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.860
Caption: all right

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.278
Caption: damn we did well all right right on time

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:19.858
Caption: guys so today uh we have Brandon Lewis

00:00:17.278 --> 00:00:23.340
Caption: Here Brandon is going to talk to us

00:00:19.858 --> 00:00:25.198
Caption: about the art of creative coding Brandon

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.720
Caption: has been developing software for about

00:00:25.198 --> 00:00:30.840
Caption: 20 years and is currently a senior

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:33.238
Caption: manager of software engineering at one

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.880
Caption: of perth&#39;s largest mutuals he&#39;s

00:00:33.238 --> 00:00:40.319
Caption: presented previously at DDD

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.200
Caption: and his previous chat was around uses of

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:45.180
Caption: blockchain outside of cryptocurrency

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.299
Caption: today he&#39;ll be exploring the question

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.299
Caption: can code create up over to you

00:00:54.058 --> 00:00:57.959
Caption: oh

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:59.519
Caption: thanks thanks very much

00:00:57.959 --> 00:01:01.259
Caption: um wow it&#39;s a good turnout thank you

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.719
Caption: very much for for coming

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:05.338
Caption: um really appreciate you taking the time

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.319
Caption: before we start I just want to thank the

00:01:05.338 --> 00:01:08.938
Caption: sponsors for ddb Perth without their

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:13.879
Caption: generous support this event wouldn&#39;t be

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.880
Caption: possible so thank you very much for that

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:18.839
Caption: today what I really want to do is I I

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:21.599
Caption: have three objectives I&#39;m hoping to sort

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:23.399
Caption: of inspire all of you to to try your

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:24.839
Caption: hand at creative art or creative or

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.520
Caption: generative art

00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:27.599
Caption: um and create code or create art with

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.099
Caption: code

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.139
Caption: I&#39;m going to show you some of the tools

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:33.118
Caption: that you might be able to use to do this

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:35.639
Caption: and some techniques some basic

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.500
Caption: techniques to sort of get you started

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:40.259
Caption: what you shouldn&#39;t expect is a math

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.339
Caption: master class so while there are there

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.500
Caption: are some relationships between

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:46.319
Caption: mathematics and creative coding I&#39;m

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.500
Caption: still very much a student of maths more

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:53.399
Caption: so than a teacher so so don&#39;t expect any

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.180
Caption: any any math secrets to be honest

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.299
Caption: um

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.239
Caption: and web 3 and nfts big topics of course

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.520
Caption: uh don&#39;t expect to learn how to get rich

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:04.139
Caption: or Dogecoin or with Dogecoin selling

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:06.539
Caption: Profile Pics that&#39;s that&#39;s not what

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:08.039
Caption: we&#39;re here for

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.779
Caption: a bit about me

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.738
Caption: uh I&#39;ve been developing commercial

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:15.300
Caption: software for about 20 years I&#39;ve been

00:02:12.738 --> 00:02:17.759
Caption: coding for closer to 30 at this point

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.319
Caption: I&#39;ve worked across the entire software

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:21.238
Caption: stack from front end to back end and

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.580
Caption: everything in between I specialized in

00:02:21.238 --> 00:02:25.979
Caption: integration for many many years before

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.738
Caption: moving into leadership roles and

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.659
Caption: proceeding with that as my my career

00:02:28.738 --> 00:02:33.720
Caption: currently I&#39;m a software engineering

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.760
Caption: manager at a large wa based Mutual where

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.860
Caption: I lead a bunch of awesome people to do

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.539
Caption: cool stuff and I support them in being

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.000
Caption: awesome

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:44.159
Caption: you can find me on all of the various

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.559
Caption: twitters and linkedins and and whatnot

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.518
Caption: and I blog about leadership in my my

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:51.958
Caption: blog at leader kaizen.com

00:02:49.518 --> 00:02:53.399
Caption: of course I being a leader I don&#39;t

00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:56.759
Caption: really code all this all that much

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:58.860
Caption: anymore in my work day to day so I have

00:02:56.759 --> 00:03:00.899
Caption: to get my coding kicked elsewhere and to

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.458
Caption: do that I usually create my own projects

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.659
Caption: and work on things on the side in my

00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:06.958
Caption: spare time

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.878
Caption: uh that&#39;s sort of how I came to to get

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:11.819
Caption: involved with unity and and learn unity

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:13.979
Caption: and develop game prototypes with it I

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.378
Caption: really enjoy understanding how those

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:18.300
Caption: processes and Mechanics Work and seeing

00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:19.800
Caption: if I can create them myself it&#39;s a good

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.120
Caption: learning experience and and keeps my

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.979
Caption: skills

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:24.979
Caption: um current I suppose

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:31.259
Caption: it&#39;s also how I got into to shaders so

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:33.479
Caption: from from unity and learning mechanics

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.699
Caption: and and developing those things I got

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:37.860
Caption: into Shader development which is really

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:40.139
Caption: another gateway to to creative coding

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.539
Caption: and how I got into that

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:45.000
Caption: some of the examples of shaders I&#39;ve

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:48.658
Caption: created are things like

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.699
Caption: Mr shaders for lava obscuring or objects

00:03:48.658 --> 00:03:53.759
Caption: that are obscured and doing outlines and

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:57.059
Caption: and mixing uh messing with things like Z

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:58.559
Caption: buffer and whatnot to fake uh fake um

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:01.080
Caption: transparency and the light and some

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:01.860
Caption: Ripples and whatnot

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.080
Caption: um

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.958
Caption: but of course I haven&#39;t actually

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.839
Caption: finished a game and this tweet kind of

00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:13.639
Caption: explains why uh that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:13.639
Caption: that explains me really

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:17.040
Caption: but it turns out that my first

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:19.260
Caption: experience with creative coding was

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.000
Caption: actually many many years ago when I was

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.100
Caption: about nine years old

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.799
Caption: I joined a computer Club you know with

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.500
Caption: all the cool kids did right and got

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:30.418
Caption: introduced to logo uh in log with logo

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.919
Caption: you create you move a turtle around and

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.880
Caption: draw images on the screen and it&#39;s

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:39.000
Caption: actually used to to promote software

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.899
Caption: literacy and develop skills at a low

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.779
Caption: level

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:46.380
Caption: I didn&#39;t realize at the time of course

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:48.359
Caption: but it was um it was fun I suppose and

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.100
Caption: what I&#39;d like to actually do is maybe uh

00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:51.418
Caption: maybe share

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.000
Caption: some of the things that you could do

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.459
Caption: with logo because uh

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.839
Caption: that&#39;s pretty cool

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:59.819
Caption: of course being

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:02.940
Caption: this is a logo interpreter developed in

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.520
Caption: in JS and JavaScript available freely

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.519
Caption: and online I&#39;ll have links and resources

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:10.619
Caption: at the end of the attender presentation

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:12.839
Caption: but of course being nine this is kind of

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:15.899
Caption: what I created right like

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:17.899
Caption: as you&#39;ve drawn on a piece of paper and

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:20.160
Caption: of course when your skills are limited

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:22.500
Caption: and you don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.279
Caption: doing you kind of just

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.259
Caption: chaos right just chaos and just create

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:30.299
Caption: all sorts of random stuff that you think

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.279
Caption: looks cool

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:33.720
Caption: but it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t until recently

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:37.199
Caption: that I realized you could actually do

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.419
Caption: some pretty cool things like uh some

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.699
Caption: depictions of mathematical algorithms uh

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.339
Caption: in in logo itself and I I thought that

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:47.220
Caption: was pretty cool so this is a this is an

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:48.000
Caption: example of Philo taxes which is a

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.820
Caption: um

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.759
Caption: it is the the way that leaves grow on

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.759
Caption: stems and plants so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:58.019
Caption: biology biology thing which is tied to a

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.660
Caption: mathematical can be represented

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:01.679
Caption: mathematically and thus depicted in in

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.059
Caption: code

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:05.059
Caption: and I thought that was pretty cool

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.239
Caption: sorry

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:17.239
Caption: technical issues

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:22.519
Caption: yeah

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.519
Caption: real technical issues

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:34.619
Caption: cool

00:06:30.859 --> 00:06:36.538
Caption: uh sorry

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:40.619
Caption: technology has evolved obviously since

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:42.660
Caption: uh since logo and the ability to create

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:44.539
Caption: to create such stuff is is a lot more

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.440
Caption: accessible and a lot easier to do

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.940
Caption: particularly with things available on

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.220
Caption: the web like you just saw I could do

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.199
Caption: logo with um through through a browser

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.559
Caption: which is really cool

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:57.239
Caption: but today I&#39;m going to be showing you uh

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:59.519
Caption: p5.js and Shader toy which are two tools

00:06:57.239 --> 00:07:01.138
Caption: that create art in very different ways

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:03.359
Caption: and I&#39;m going to sort of speak through

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:04.559
Caption: how those differ but both tools are

00:07:03.359 --> 00:07:06.418
Caption: web-based both are freely available

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:07.739
Caption: don&#39;t require any subscriptions or any

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:09.119
Caption: payments and you don&#39;t even have to

00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:11.459
Caption: create an account on any of the sites

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:14.279
Caption: you can just kind of use them

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:16.440
Caption: uh there are there are comparisons that

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:18.179
Caption: you can draw between creative code or

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.059
Caption: creative or art generator through code

00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:23.759
Caption: and traditional art and I like to view

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:25.079
Caption: them as the programs that you use or the

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:27.598
Caption: apps that you use very much the mediums

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:30.539
Caption: much like canvases and stone and wood

00:07:27.598 --> 00:07:32.579
Caption: where they determine largely the thing

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:33.899
Caption: you&#39;re going to create so you don&#39;t you

00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:35.638
Caption: don&#39;t create a sculpture with a canvas

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:38.519
Caption: for example and you can sort of view

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:40.319
Caption: tools in the same sort of vein and then

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:42.479
Caption: the algorithms and the the methods that

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:44.459
Caption: you use to create these things the code

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:46.440
Caption: that you create that&#39;s your brushes and

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:47.638
Caption: your pens and your chisels

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.380
Caption: uh

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:53.220
Caption: and so I&#39;m going to talk through some of

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:55.619
Caption: some of those today as we work through

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.319
Caption: some of the demos

00:07:55.619 --> 00:07:59.940
Caption: um generative art is I think and I&#39;ll

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:01.799
Caption: sort of take a small tangent here and

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.919
Caption: speak of nfts like I wasn&#39;t going to do

00:08:01.799 --> 00:08:08.638
Caption: but I generally think that uh gender of

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:11.098
Caption: art is a real genuine use case for nfts

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:13.080
Caption: packaging the code along with the

00:08:11.098 --> 00:08:14.339
Caption: parameters to create the thing I think

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:17.399
Caption: is

00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:19.319
Caption: is very valuable and I think is a real

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:23.239
Caption: um there&#39;s a real benefit

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:23.239
Caption: and a genuine use case for nfts

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:28.079
Caption: uh

00:08:25.019 --> 00:08:29.519
Caption: processing with p5.js so p5.js is the

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:32.039
Caption: first of the tools I wanted to speak to

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:33.718
Caption: you about today and it&#39;s it&#39;s based on

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.338
Caption: processing it&#39;s a flavor of processing

00:08:33.718 --> 00:08:36.778
Caption: and processing was developed in I think

00:08:35.338 --> 00:08:38.940
Caption: 2001

00:08:36.778 --> 00:08:42.059
Caption: as a

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:44.539
Caption: as a software literacy tool it&#39;s a it&#39;s

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:48.299
Caption: a Java based Graphics library and IDE

00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:51.239
Caption: that that you can draw stuff with it&#39;s

00:08:48.299 --> 00:08:52.979
Caption: it is highly powerful and it&#39;s used for

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:54.838
Caption: things like simulations as well so it&#39;s

00:08:52.979 --> 00:08:57.479
Caption: got a breadth everywhere from sort of

00:08:54.838 --> 00:08:58.919
Caption: beginner level access to to very very

00:08:57.479 --> 00:09:01.199
Caption: high level

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:03.239
Caption: the p5.js is a web implementation of

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.679
Caption: that as the name suggests leveraging

00:09:03.239 --> 00:09:06.838
Caption: JavaScript

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:08.219
Caption: it does have a web editor or you can

00:09:06.838 --> 00:09:10.380
Caption: build your own which I think is pretty

00:09:08.219 --> 00:09:12.119
Caption: is pretty nifty

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.059
Caption: um as I mentioned it&#39;s it&#39;s really easy

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:17.398
Caption: to use really easy to get into and it&#39;s

00:09:15.059 --> 00:09:19.140
Caption: reasonably well documented uh you can

00:09:17.398 --> 00:09:21.659
Caption: there are enough similarities while not

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.760
Caption: a direct one-to-one Port of processing

00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:25.079
Caption: the the similarities are close enough

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.479
Caption: that you could actually leverage the

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.760
Caption: documentation in tandem

00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:31.380
Caption: uh it is I consider sort of a high level

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.299
Caption: language it abstracts a lot of the

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.000
Caption: difficulty and complexity in creating

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:37.440
Caption: some of this stuff quite well so for

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.419
Caption: example you can draw a circle you can

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.059
Caption: draw a square or if you&#39;re in 3D a cube

00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:43.979
Caption: or a sphere and you&#39;d also use vectors

00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:46.380
Caption: and vectors is kind of we&#39;ll touch on

00:09:43.979 --> 00:09:48.059
Caption: some of those but in a bit

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.239
Caption: um but having that control really

00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:53.278
Caption: expands the possibilities that you have

00:09:51.239 --> 00:09:55.018
Caption: uh and it&#39;s a bit more like I say a bit

00:09:53.278 --> 00:09:56.940
Caption: more high level than than shaders that

00:09:55.018 --> 00:10:00.778
Caption: we&#39;ll touch on a bit later

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.799
Caption: you can like I say do 2D and 3D stuff uh

00:10:00.778 --> 00:10:03.059
Caption: so

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:05.940
Caption: um we&#39;ll we&#39;ll speak through some of

00:10:03.059 --> 00:10:07.739
Caption: those as well

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.320
Caption: to give you an example

00:10:07.739 --> 00:10:12.599
Caption: uh these are all created with p5.js so

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.080
Caption: as you can see very different uh in

00:10:12.599 --> 00:10:18.000
Caption: style very different in nature and

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.360
Caption: I could speak particularly for the for

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.859
Caption: the um the one on the right that took a

00:10:21.359 --> 00:10:24.299
Caption: lot of time and a lot of effort it&#39;s

00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:26.880
Caption: really interesting how that came about

00:10:24.299 --> 00:10:29.099
Caption: and the author or the the artist

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.018
Caption: um posts a really good blog post on that

00:10:29.099 --> 00:10:32.099
Caption: which which I&#39;ll share in the slide deck

00:10:31.018 --> 00:10:33.719
Caption: as well

00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:35.398
Caption: that they they talk about how they

00:10:33.719 --> 00:10:37.139
Caption: actually created it and it&#39;s fascinating

00:10:35.398 --> 00:10:38.820
Caption: to see that actually

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.239
Caption: um come to life and come to fruition

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.559
Caption: long processed many months

00:10:42.239 --> 00:10:45.898
Caption: and of course you can create animations

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:47.760
Caption: and I think that&#39;s

00:10:45.898 --> 00:10:50.219
Caption: um that&#39;s one of the the strongest draws

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.660
Caption: of this in terms of uh in terms of

00:10:50.219 --> 00:10:52.979
Caption: comparisons with traditional art and

00:10:51.659 --> 00:10:55.559
Caption: it&#39;s something I think we as as

00:10:52.979 --> 00:10:57.000
Caption: developers as coders have have an

00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:58.799
Caption: advantage and we can create some really

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.539
Caption: cool animations

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:03.260
Caption: um with with things like p5.js and

00:11:00.539 --> 00:11:03.259
Caption: Shader toy

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:15.440
Caption: so let&#39;s get on to some some demos right

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.440
Caption: Sans the technical difficulties

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.099
Caption: can you close that one

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:27.599
Caption: so

00:11:26.099 --> 00:11:29.398
Caption: p5.js

00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:32.639
Caption: you can go to built-in editor

00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:34.619
Caption: I guess a super super simple if you want

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.820
Caption: to create a circle create a circle and

00:11:34.619 --> 00:11:38.398
Caption: then we&#39;ll do it in the middle of the

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.320
Caption: screen so what&#39;s divided by two height

00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:41.880
Caption: divided by two if I could type that&#39;d be

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.059
Caption: great

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.500
Caption: and 50. and it&#39;s a radius of 50 or

00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:48.838
Caption: diameter 50.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.539
Caption: any credit Circle super easy

00:11:48.838 --> 00:11:54.479
Caption: you change the color of the circle so

00:11:51.539 --> 00:11:56.159
Caption: change the fill to I don&#39;t know

00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:58.078
Caption: red Maybe

00:11:56.159 --> 00:11:58.919
Caption: because red

00:11:58.078 --> 00:12:00.659
Caption: yeah

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:03.000
Caption: yeah

00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:05.759
Caption: red so

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.380
Caption: super easy to use and I think that&#39;s one

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.778
Caption: of the biggest draws in terms of getting

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:13.859
Caption: into it and just getting into creative

00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:16.099
Caption: art and trying to learn how to to think

00:12:13.859 --> 00:12:19.500
Caption: creatively rather than problem solve

00:12:16.099 --> 00:12:22.338
Caption: it&#39;s a really easy barrier really low

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.338
Caption: barrier to entry

00:12:24.479 --> 00:12:27.659
Caption: um

00:12:25.739 --> 00:12:30.659
Caption: but you can also create things like this

00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:31.979
Caption: right and

00:12:30.659 --> 00:12:34.199
Caption: this is an example of something I

00:12:31.979 --> 00:12:38.578
Caption: created with in collaboration with the

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:40.919
Caption: guys at maker X when trying to I suppose

00:12:38.578 --> 00:12:42.919
Caption: defect or visualize earthquakes in an

00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:46.440
Caption: interesting fashion

00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:49.078
Caption: and we use kind of the number of circles

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:52.320
Caption: that it would generate as as the the

00:12:49.078 --> 00:12:55.440
Caption: magnitudes would reflect those and then

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.078
Caption: plot them randomly or in turn or perhaps

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.518
Caption: in a geographical location and a line

00:12:58.078 --> 00:13:01.380
Caption: that like that

00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:03.239
Caption: but what&#39;s really interesting is that

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:05.160
Caption: there aren&#39;t any circles here

00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:07.200
Caption: these are actually created just by

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:10.739
Caption: creating tangents tangents at regular

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:13.200
Caption: intervals and drawing a line and this is

00:13:10.739 --> 00:13:14.719
Caption: I think where the real power we start to

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.480
Caption: see the real power or something like

00:13:14.719 --> 00:13:20.039
Caption: p5.js where you can use vectors to to

00:13:18.479 --> 00:13:21.419
Caption: project these things which are much more

00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:22.440
Caption: difficult to do if you have to roll it

00:13:21.419 --> 00:13:25.138
Caption: yourself

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.838
Caption: so what I actually do here is I take a

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:29.880
Caption: point in a circle I project a vector on

00:13:27.838 --> 00:13:31.619
Caption: One Direction added to the other side

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.720
Caption: and then draw a line between the two and

00:13:31.619 --> 00:13:36.119
Caption: I just do that for everything for 360

00:13:33.719 --> 00:13:38.219
Caption: times and it kind of draws a circle

00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:40.018
Caption: uh and I looked through through one of

00:13:38.219 --> 00:13:42.479
Caption: the circle so it&#39;s still relatively

00:13:40.018 --> 00:13:45.138
Caption: simple to do I&#39;m not using any advanced

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:47.518
Caption: mathematics it&#39;s basic high school maps

00:13:45.138 --> 00:13:48.359
Caption: and it creates some really interesting

00:13:47.518 --> 00:13:50.398
Caption: stuff

00:13:48.359 --> 00:13:52.078
Caption: but of course you can just keep creating

00:13:50.398 --> 00:13:54.179
Caption: new versions

00:13:52.078 --> 00:13:56.760
Caption: over and over

00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:59.700
Caption: um or you could perhaps not even make it

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:02.398
Caption: random and you could take the circle out

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.440
Caption: and have it depicted elsewhere

00:14:02.398 --> 00:14:07.500
Caption: the creative pot and this is where it

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.578
Caption: gets super super interesting is uh you

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.778
Caption: start off with something like this with

00:14:08.578 --> 00:14:12.059
Caption: a simple idea

00:14:09.778 --> 00:14:13.859
Caption: and then you try to expand upon it and

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:15.239
Caption: you could perhaps create something a bit

00:14:13.859 --> 00:14:18.299
Caption: more like this

00:14:15.239 --> 00:14:20.760
Caption: and this is completely different in many

00:14:18.299 --> 00:14:22.979
Caption: ways to to the other but the code is

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.278
Caption: almost identical so what I do here is

00:14:22.979 --> 00:14:29.578
Caption: instead of creating uh like 360 lines to

00:14:26.278 --> 00:14:30.659
Caption: create a circle make them random and I

00:14:29.578 --> 00:14:34.260
Caption: give them all different colors at

00:14:30.659 --> 00:14:36.000
Caption: different points and just draw them draw

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:39.059
Caption: a number of them and Vary the alpha

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.440
Caption: randomly as well so you get the sort of

00:14:39.059 --> 00:14:42.440
Caption: stringy sort of look

00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:49.219
Caption: and of course oh if I was to remove the

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:49.219
Caption: seed

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:56.219
Caption: you can create a and create and create

00:14:54.838 --> 00:14:58.018
Caption: all sorts of

00:14:56.219 --> 00:15:00.359
Caption: different images and of course you can

00:14:58.018 --> 00:15:02.278
Caption: constrain them so there I&#39;m not really

00:15:00.359 --> 00:15:04.979
Caption: doing anything anything to limit where

00:15:02.278 --> 00:15:06.419
Caption: those things appear but you can you can

00:15:04.979 --> 00:15:10.578
Caption: sort of do that and we&#39;ll get to some

00:15:06.419 --> 00:15:10.578
Caption: examples that do that in a tick

00:15:11.698 --> 00:15:13.698
Caption: um

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:20.458
Caption: but you can do something that&#39;s more

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:23.039
Caption: structured perhaps and something that

00:15:20.458 --> 00:15:24.719
Caption: perhaps even mimics real life art so

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:25.500
Caption: like you&#39;re painting or something like

00:15:24.719 --> 00:15:27.479
Caption: that

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.359
Caption: and this is an example that I pulled

00:15:27.479 --> 00:15:32.880
Caption: together where I took a cityscape a city

00:15:30.359 --> 00:15:35.940
Caption: um City skyline as

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:39.239
Caption: uh as um

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:43.679
Caption: as inspiration and I wanted to I started

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:46.820
Caption: off quite simply where I just had uh

00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:46.820
Caption: true false

00:15:49.739 --> 00:15:54.958
Caption: I thought about like that

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:57.778
Caption: and one of the things I really wanted to

00:15:54.958 --> 00:16:00.479
Caption: experiment with was layering layering on

00:15:57.778 --> 00:16:03.419
Caption: top of it to create this perspective and

00:16:00.479 --> 00:16:05.278
Caption: adjusting the alpha at various levels to

00:16:03.419 --> 00:16:06.838
Caption: to give that sort of perspective but

00:16:05.278 --> 00:16:08.820
Caption: then of course that Evolution comes into

00:16:06.838 --> 00:16:10.919
Caption: play and you&#39;re like well I want to try

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.500
Caption: I want to try to play with bezier curves

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:16.198
Caption: or bezier Curves and so I added clouds

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:19.078
Caption: as bezier curves bezio curves again

00:16:16.198 --> 00:16:20.398
Caption: another example of how p5gs makes

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:22.619
Caption: something that

00:16:20.398 --> 00:16:25.078
Caption: could be quite mathematically

00:16:22.619 --> 00:16:26.398
Caption: complex if you wanted it to be it

00:16:25.078 --> 00:16:28.619
Caption: doesn&#39;t have to be mind you but it can

00:16:26.398 --> 00:16:33.320
Caption: be and makes it really simple that&#39;s a

00:16:28.619 --> 00:16:33.320
Caption: simple simple function to create it uh

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.859
Caption: busier

00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:42.359
Caption: so I kind of create those but then I

00:16:40.258 --> 00:16:43.619
Caption: thought well what if I want to make it

00:16:42.359 --> 00:16:45.599
Caption: look like a paintbrush instead of

00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:47.880
Caption: something that&#39;s solid like that I mean

00:16:45.599 --> 00:16:49.679
Caption: that that&#39;ll look cool and stuff but I

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.440
Caption: mean why not

00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:54.539
Caption: this takes a bit of a bit of time

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.159
Caption: why not create to create a paintbrush

00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:57.419
Caption: and the way I did that was now there

00:16:56.159 --> 00:17:00.059
Caption: isn&#39;t a paintbrush you can&#39;t say hey

00:16:57.419 --> 00:17:01.919
Caption: p5.js draw me a paintbrush or Draw this

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:03.659
Caption: in a paintbrush stroke pattern

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:06.000
Caption: um you have to create this manually and

00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:08.039
Caption: that&#39;s just that&#39;s easy you take the

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.359
Caption: square and you PL take the pixels and

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.679
Caption: you just do one pixel at a time and

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:14.458
Caption: that&#39;s sort of why it takes a bit a bit

00:17:10.678 --> 00:17:15.719
Caption: longer to do and we&#39;ll get into to how

00:17:14.458 --> 00:17:17.280
Caption: this this is where one of the key

00:17:15.719 --> 00:17:18.539
Caption: differentiates between this and Shader

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.140
Caption: toy that we&#39;ll talk about later sort of

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.140
Caption: comes into play

00:17:21.298 --> 00:17:24.659
Caption: and then I thought well that doesn&#39;t

00:17:22.739 --> 00:17:26.280
Caption: really look brush-like right so you

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.720
Caption: don&#39;t get the brush stroke at the end

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.460
Caption: and I wanted to just get brush Strokes

00:17:27.719 --> 00:17:31.439
Caption: so I added

00:17:29.459 --> 00:17:33.659
Caption: I add a little Randomness to the length

00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:35.159
Caption: of each stroke so each line is going up

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:38.580
Caption: in a single pattern

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.919
Caption: and I&#39;m just just randomizing the height

00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:42.779
Caption: of that line each time to create a sort

00:17:40.918 --> 00:17:44.099
Caption: of brushstroke

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.919
Caption: and the pallets I mean you might have

00:17:44.099 --> 00:17:48.359
Caption: noticed that have pallets for or

00:17:46.918 --> 00:17:50.939
Caption: different palettes for everything and

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:53.459
Caption: that&#39;s just a list of of Json uh Json

00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:55.979
Caption: hex values and I&#39;ll load them in

00:17:53.459 --> 00:17:59.119
Caption: and then randomly pick one that&#39;s that&#39;s

00:17:55.979 --> 00:17:59.119
Caption: as simple as it gets really

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.320
Caption: speaking of bezier Curves

00:18:04.619 --> 00:18:11.219
Caption: I think bezier curves are are a

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:13.798
Caption: beautiful illustration of maths they

00:18:11.219 --> 00:18:15.380
Caption: that they&#39;re really simple in in nature

00:18:13.798 --> 00:18:18.538
Caption: but they can make some incredibly

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:20.819
Caption: interesting shapes and I sort of took

00:18:18.538 --> 00:18:23.219
Caption: inspiration here from you know the world

00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:25.319
Caption: windows screen savers and sort of kind

00:18:23.219 --> 00:18:28.798
Caption: of bouncing around that was the

00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:30.359
Caption: inspiration right and and it&#39;s

00:18:28.798 --> 00:18:32.459
Caption: I haven&#39;t colored any of these and

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:33.959
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s I think the the next next

00:18:32.459 --> 00:18:35.038
Caption: phase is sort of what do you do with

00:18:33.959 --> 00:18:36.178
Caption: these do you want to extend them so you

00:18:35.038 --> 00:18:40.319
Caption: take something that&#39;s really simple in

00:18:36.178 --> 00:18:43.500
Caption: just 40 lines of code and you can create

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:45.538
Caption: all sorts of different shapes

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.579
Caption: and you start to want to create a bit

00:18:45.538 --> 00:18:49.798
Caption: your creative part takes over and you&#39;re

00:18:47.579 --> 00:18:51.719
Caption: like well what can we do with that for

00:18:49.798 --> 00:18:53.459
Caption: this particular instance I sort of took

00:18:51.719 --> 00:18:55.260
Caption: one bezier curve and then just linked it

00:18:53.459 --> 00:18:57.239
Caption: to another one but what if you made that

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:59.400
Caption: random at some in some way or what if

00:18:57.239 --> 00:19:02.160
Caption: you had that deterministic in some other

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.660
Caption: fashion what if you added color what if

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.239
Caption: you added different shading to the

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:09.619
Caption: different lines then you start to get

00:19:06.239 --> 00:19:09.619
Caption: some art right

00:19:11.178 --> 00:19:17.459
Caption: a noise so uh

00:19:15.479 --> 00:19:19.439
Caption: speaking of Randomness there is there is

00:19:17.459 --> 00:19:20.939
Caption: a lot of Randomness in Creative code and

00:19:19.439 --> 00:19:22.739
Caption: there&#39;s sorts of there&#39;s a few different

00:19:20.939 --> 00:19:24.418
Caption: ways you can approach that right and

00:19:22.739 --> 00:19:26.760
Caption: there&#39;s you can have it as either

00:19:24.418 --> 00:19:28.019
Caption: completely random between two values and

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.520
Caption: it&#39;ll pick something

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.919
Caption: but sometimes you need something a bit

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.919
Caption: more nuanced a bit a bit more subtle

00:19:31.918 --> 00:19:36.779
Caption: right and noise is a great way to do

00:19:34.918 --> 00:19:40.159
Caption: that something like purlin noise for

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:42.900
Caption: example where it&#39;s a gradient of of of

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.400
Caption: Randomness it&#39;s something you can use in

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.979
Caption: this in when you want something like

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.839
Caption: this where you&#39;re only incrementing a

00:19:46.979 --> 00:19:50.819
Caption: value by a small amount from the last

00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:53.279
Caption: value every time and you sort of iterate

00:19:50.819 --> 00:19:55.918
Caption: over that map of that purlin noise and

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.260
Caption: adjust the value accordingly

00:19:55.918 --> 00:20:02.219
Caption: very very powerful again something that

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.219
Caption: is natively built into p5.js

00:20:05.699 --> 00:20:09.599
Caption: sorry speech speak rules I mentioned

00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:11.160
Caption: rules earlier where you want to sort of

00:20:09.599 --> 00:20:12.780
Caption: constrain stuff and I suppose this is

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.539
Caption: more sort of software engineering

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.219
Caption: developery type of stuff

00:20:15.538 --> 00:20:19.379
Caption: but you could constrain stuff like

00:20:17.219 --> 00:20:21.178
Caption: Circle packing and you could say well

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.099
Caption: don&#39;t have any circles over that don&#39;t

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:25.739
Caption: create circles another Circle and create

00:20:23.099 --> 00:20:26.640
Caption: some interesting diminishing patterns

00:20:25.739 --> 00:20:28.020
Caption: um

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.940
Caption: and you can then extend that again

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.099
Caption: evolutionary well what can you do with

00:20:29.939 --> 00:20:33.538
Caption: that perhaps you have that in certain

00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:35.339
Caption: shapes you could have that along a

00:20:33.538 --> 00:20:37.739
Caption: bezier curve so you have a bezier curve

00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:40.079
Caption: and have the the circles all pack along

00:20:37.739 --> 00:20:42.058
Caption: that curve within a certain radius and

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:44.959
Caption: create lines like that

00:20:42.058 --> 00:20:47.459
Caption: or maybe you just want to represent

00:20:44.959 --> 00:20:49.558
Caption: represent Doge right

00:20:47.459 --> 00:20:51.479
Caption: because because why not

00:20:49.558 --> 00:20:54.599
Caption: and and this is this is a really cool

00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:56.640
Caption: example of just taking an image sampling

00:20:54.599 --> 00:20:58.859
Caption: the pixel of where your point is and

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:01.619
Caption: then making the color of that Circle

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:03.418
Caption: that that pixel color and you can create

00:21:01.619 --> 00:21:05.160
Caption: something like this and of course you

00:21:03.418 --> 00:21:07.380
Caption: can you can adjust all of all of the

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.960
Caption: values and you can have uh circles be

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:11.400
Caption: bigger or smaller and you can do have to

00:21:09.959 --> 00:21:14.939
Caption: make some changes to this to make the

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:18.839
Caption: image a bit more legible because if you

00:21:14.939 --> 00:21:20.459
Caption: have massive uh massive circles you then

00:21:18.839 --> 00:21:21.839
Caption: start to have huge Circles of one color

00:21:20.459 --> 00:21:23.459
Caption: and you can&#39;t really get that definition

00:21:21.839 --> 00:21:26.279
Caption: you don&#39;t really tell you not retail

00:21:23.459 --> 00:21:28.439
Caption: what it is so I had to implement

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.539
Caption: something which would

00:21:28.439 --> 00:21:32.819
Caption: grow it and then slow it down as it got

00:21:30.538 --> 00:21:35.038
Caption: bigger so as the circle got bigger I

00:21:32.819 --> 00:21:38.579
Caption: would slow the the growth down so that

00:21:35.038 --> 00:21:40.619
Caption: it wouldn&#39;t really go past much a

00:21:38.579 --> 00:21:44.058
Caption: certain size and it would give time for

00:21:40.619 --> 00:21:44.058
Caption: more circles to fill in and pack it

00:21:44.119 --> 00:21:47.119
Caption: foreign

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:52.260
Caption: taxes again so much like the logo

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.739
Caption: example I shared earlier but this time

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:58.260
Caption: with nice pretty colors and

00:21:55.739 --> 00:22:00.418
Caption: I want to show this purely because I

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.339
Caption: want to show that the maths around it is

00:22:00.418 --> 00:22:03.959
Caption: super super simple

00:22:02.339 --> 00:22:05.339
Caption: and I think this is something which

00:22:03.959 --> 00:22:07.979
Caption: initially

00:22:05.339 --> 00:22:09.298
Caption: uh I found daunting when looking at

00:22:07.979 --> 00:22:10.500
Caption: creative code I would see all these

00:22:09.298 --> 00:22:12.678
Caption: things on Twitter all these things on

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.939
Caption: LinkedIn be like that looks really cool

00:22:12.678 --> 00:22:16.019
Caption: but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s really difficult to

00:22:14.939 --> 00:22:18.839
Caption: do

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.400
Caption: and it&#39;s when you start to really dig

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:22.140
Caption: into it and you you even just look up

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.700
Caption: some of them you go into Wikipedia and

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.500
Caption: you look up what some of these equations

00:22:23.699 --> 00:22:26.579
Caption: look like and they&#39;re not difficult but

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.439
Caption: they can create some really really

00:22:26.579 --> 00:22:31.319
Caption: interesting patterns

00:22:28.439 --> 00:22:33.058
Caption: um taking that a step further

00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:34.798
Caption: and you can create

00:22:33.058 --> 00:22:38.158
Caption: images like that that is the same

00:22:34.798 --> 00:22:40.739
Caption: pattern just I&#39;m now adjusting the size

00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:42.059
Caption: of each of the circles and I&#39;m coloring

00:22:40.739 --> 00:22:45.538
Caption: it a bit differently

00:22:42.058 --> 00:22:47.939
Caption: that&#39;s really it&#39;s the same code just a

00:22:45.538 --> 00:22:50.119
Caption: bit different same same bit different

00:22:47.939 --> 00:22:50.119
Caption: thank you

00:22:50.959 --> 00:22:55.859
Caption: but it doesn&#39;t have to be all geometric

00:22:53.219 --> 00:22:58.500
Caption: you can make stuff that&#39;s really random

00:22:55.859 --> 00:23:03.479
Caption: uh really interesting and almost paint

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:06.839
Caption: like and this I sort of I tried to to

00:23:03.479 --> 00:23:08.939
Caption: replicate or reproduce a Jackson Pollock

00:23:06.839 --> 00:23:11.699
Caption: painting So with lots of just sort of

00:23:08.939 --> 00:23:12.599
Caption: paint everywhere in arbitrary ways

00:23:11.699 --> 00:23:14.219
Caption: um

00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:17.038
Caption: and

00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:19.558
Caption: this is sort of what it comes up with

00:23:17.038 --> 00:23:21.119
Caption: but of course the benefit being code is

00:23:19.558 --> 00:23:24.298
Caption: you can create

00:23:21.119 --> 00:23:25.558
Caption: as many as you want

00:23:24.298 --> 00:23:26.880
Caption: and you can tell that they&#39;re all

00:23:25.558 --> 00:23:28.380
Caption: slightly different in terms of brush

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.058
Caption: sizes and that&#39;s all determined by the

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:33.178
Caption: code so I could limit it to certain

00:23:30.058 --> 00:23:34.640
Caption: brush sizes or brushes or I could make

00:23:33.178 --> 00:23:37.439
Caption: it go wild

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.000
Caption: patterns and and you can introduce

00:23:37.439 --> 00:23:41.279
Caption: patterns to it and there&#39;s a really

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.339
Caption: interesting article I read about taking

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.659
Caption: an image and using the values of those

00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:48.538
Caption: images or the color values of those

00:23:45.659 --> 00:23:50.280
Caption: images to manipulate how the lines are

00:23:48.538 --> 00:23:51.899
Caption: drawn so you end up having something

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.520
Caption: that looks like this but it has

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.479
Caption: structure within it I thought that was

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.479
Caption: really really interesting

00:23:57.298 --> 00:23:59.298
Caption: um

00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:06.658
Caption: but this is the re this is really the uh

00:24:04.079 --> 00:24:08.099
Caption: this particular example is the the

00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:10.020
Caption: technique I really wanted to go in depth

00:24:08.099 --> 00:24:11.520
Caption: with a bit more because you sort of you

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.280
Caption: look at it and you can&#39;t it might be

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.780
Caption: difficult to see what&#39;s going on how you

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.520
Caption: create that

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:20.760
Caption: but when I found out how to create this

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:23.459
Caption: I was amazed how easy it actually was uh

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.500
Caption: uh and it&#39;s all very very logical and

00:24:23.459 --> 00:24:27.779
Caption: it&#39;s easy to demonstrate as well

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.760
Caption: so you take a look at something like

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:33.000
Caption: this and

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:35.880
Caption: all it is is it&#39;s a it&#39;s a flow field

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.439
Caption: but it&#39;s created with vectors which I

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.260
Caption: mentioned earlier which again benefit of

00:24:37.439 --> 00:24:42.178
Caption: p5.js

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.579
Caption: but that&#39;s what it looks like

00:24:42.178 --> 00:24:46.798
Caption: so you take you take a grid you take a a

00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:48.178
Caption: canvas you plot it into grids and you

00:24:46.798 --> 00:24:49.158
Caption: can adjust the size of the grid as much

00:24:48.178 --> 00:24:52.019
Caption: as you want

00:24:49.159 --> 00:24:52.919
Caption: you then plot some purlin noise over

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.900
Caption: that

00:24:52.918 --> 00:24:57.239
Caption: and then take vectors based on that

00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:01.200
Caption: perlan noise so if your noise is zero to

00:24:57.239 --> 00:25:03.000
Caption: one and you relate that to a radius or a

00:25:01.199 --> 00:25:04.979
Caption: um to a Direction

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.900
Caption: you then direct the vector in that way

00:25:04.979 --> 00:25:09.658
Caption: and because Pearl and noise is

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.859
Caption: Progressive it&#39;s it&#39;s you start to get

00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:13.679
Caption: the sort of

00:25:10.859 --> 00:25:15.418
Caption: feel this this motion as you will so

00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:17.699
Caption: it&#39;s all like forces being applied and

00:25:15.418 --> 00:25:20.399
Caption: all of the all of the directions that

00:25:17.699 --> 00:25:22.439
Caption: you see here are just are the directions

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.119
Caption: of the flow field influenced by purlin

00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:26.099
Caption: noise

00:25:24.119 --> 00:25:28.979
Caption: and you can create of course I think

00:25:26.099 --> 00:25:31.760
Caption: I&#39;ve got this randomized I think maybe

00:25:28.979 --> 00:25:31.760
Caption: possibly

00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:39.678
Caption: I do like that seed

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.380
Caption: foreign

00:25:47.939 --> 00:25:51.778
Caption: yeah but I can take a better seat how&#39;s

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.940
Caption: that

00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:55.559
Caption: perhaps

00:25:53.939 --> 00:25:57.479
Caption: I mean you could put an any seed rally

00:25:55.558 --> 00:25:59.099
Caption: now I will I will confess there is a bit

00:25:57.479 --> 00:26:00.479
Caption: of a bug in it and you&#39;ll see

00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:02.099
Caption: occasionally you can see it here where

00:26:00.479 --> 00:26:04.199
Caption: on the edges it sort of gets trapped

00:26:02.099 --> 00:26:05.459
Caption: between two so again you get to you have

00:26:04.199 --> 00:26:08.399
Caption: to do some problem solving as an

00:26:05.459 --> 00:26:09.839
Caption: engineer and figure out well how do you

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.779
Caption: make

00:26:09.839 --> 00:26:14.400
Caption: how do you adjust the the force or the

00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:15.840
Caption: direction of those so that you don&#39;t end

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.039
Caption: up having these infinite loops on either

00:26:15.839 --> 00:26:18.298
Caption: side

00:26:17.038 --> 00:26:20.579
Caption: of course it can be adjusted even

00:26:18.298 --> 00:26:22.678
Caption: further so if you wanted to for example

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:24.178
Caption: uh have it go longer so right now I&#39;m

00:26:22.678 --> 00:26:26.038
Caption: constraining the time so it only has a

00:26:24.178 --> 00:26:27.899
Caption: certain amount of time to create

00:26:26.038 --> 00:26:30.538
Caption: and it&#39;s it&#39;s that&#39;s probably something

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.039
Caption: I should have called out it&#39;s the alpha

00:26:30.538 --> 00:26:33.658
Caption: that makes it do that so it&#39;s like

00:26:32.038 --> 00:26:36.599
Caption: putting a whole bunch of pixels on the

00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:39.240
Caption: onto the screen and then adjusting the

00:26:36.599 --> 00:26:40.439
Caption: alpha gradually over time as you&#39;re as

00:26:39.239 --> 00:26:42.000
Caption: you throw in all pixels and those pixels

00:26:40.439 --> 00:26:44.339
Caption: kind of travel around and as they leave

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.719
Caption: more Trails you start to get thicker

00:26:44.339 --> 00:26:47.640
Caption: thicker lines in the areas that they

00:26:45.719 --> 00:26:48.239
Caption: travel

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.219
Caption: um

00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:52.260
Caption: but it&#39;s the vector at the heart of it

00:26:50.219 --> 00:26:54.479
Caption: it&#39;s the vectors that really that really

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:57.298
Caption: help to make this possible

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:59.939
Caption: but again super super easy right there

00:26:57.298 --> 00:27:01.260
Caption: is nothing that should stop anyone uh

00:26:59.939 --> 00:27:02.939
Caption: even someone with very limited

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:06.479
Caption: development experience or programming

00:27:02.939 --> 00:27:09.359
Caption: experience to do this sort of stuff

00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:11.719
Caption: so it highly highly recommend people try

00:27:09.359 --> 00:27:11.719
Caption: it out

00:27:11.819 --> 00:27:14.298
Caption: cool

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:18.500
Caption: and then

00:27:18.779 --> 00:27:21.600
Caption: no

00:27:20.459 --> 00:27:24.500
Caption: yes

00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:27.359
Caption: cool so uh

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:29.400
Caption: p5.js in summary is a is a is a

00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:30.719
Caption: fantastic tool for pretty much anyone to

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.200
Caption: get into creative code

00:27:30.719 --> 00:27:36.298
Caption: it&#39;s easy to uh it&#39;s easy to get into

00:27:34.199 --> 00:27:38.639
Caption: it&#39;s well well documented

00:27:36.298 --> 00:27:40.798
Caption: but it&#39;s also a really good tool for

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.900
Caption: anyone with um with develop with

00:27:40.798 --> 00:27:44.399
Caption: Advanced programming experience and the

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.460
Caption: reason I say that

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.320
Caption: is because I&#39;ve only just scratched the

00:27:47.459 --> 00:27:51.000
Caption: surface there is a breadth of of

00:27:49.319 --> 00:27:53.099
Caption: capability there which you can leverage

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.558
Caption: I didn&#39;t even touch on the 3D stuff that

00:27:53.099 --> 00:27:57.719
Caption: you can do but you can do 3D and it does

00:27:55.558 --> 00:28:00.418
Caption: support shaders for example and you can

00:27:57.719 --> 00:28:02.939
Caption: hook it up to all sorts of other sources

00:28:00.418 --> 00:28:05.699
Caption: and it&#39;s fantastic for kids

00:28:02.939 --> 00:28:07.558
Caption: um it if logo was what we were taught

00:28:05.699 --> 00:28:09.538
Caption: sort of 30 years ago

00:28:07.558 --> 00:28:11.339
Caption: um this is is what kids should be taught

00:28:09.538 --> 00:28:12.418
Caption: now in my view

00:28:11.339 --> 00:28:14.278
Caption: uh

00:28:12.418 --> 00:28:19.519
Caption: extra benefit the skills are

00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:19.520
Caption: transferable so JS you can transfer that

00:28:20.819 --> 00:28:25.678
Caption: shaders uh

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:28.140
Caption: shaders with Shader toy

00:28:25.678 --> 00:28:30.658
Caption: so as I mentioned earlier I got into

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:32.760
Caption: unli and that introduced me to shaders

00:28:30.659 --> 00:28:34.700
Caption: and shaders are a c like

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:38.659
Caption: see likeish language

00:28:34.699 --> 00:28:41.219
Caption: users see like see like language like

00:28:38.659 --> 00:28:43.440
Caption: jlsl and hlsl

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:46.020
Caption: they are they are high level languages

00:28:43.439 --> 00:28:50.158
Caption: but I would liken them to lower level

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:53.580
Caption: languages than say um p5js in that they

00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:57.240
Caption: are assembly like it&#39;s not assembly by

00:28:53.579 --> 00:28:59.158
Caption: any means but you you the way you have

00:28:57.239 --> 00:29:01.619
Caption: to think about working with them is very

00:28:59.159 --> 00:29:03.980
Caption: much assembly like they&#39;re used in the

00:29:01.619 --> 00:29:07.459
Caption: graphics render pipeline for 3D stuff

00:29:03.979 --> 00:29:11.058
Caption: and useful things like lighting Shadows

00:29:07.459 --> 00:29:11.058
Caption: Reflections all that kind of thing

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.940
Caption: um

00:29:12.558 --> 00:29:17.579
Caption: there are several different types of

00:29:14.939 --> 00:29:19.139
Caption: shaders by the way so vertex shaders

00:29:17.579 --> 00:29:20.640
Caption: geometry shaders and fragment shaders

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.619
Caption: they all do different things we&#39;re going

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.359
Caption: to focus primarily on fragment shaders

00:29:22.619 --> 00:29:26.399
Caption: today

00:29:24.359 --> 00:29:27.599
Caption: and what&#39;s really interesting is these

00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:30.000
Caption: are some examples that were created

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:31.798
Caption: there isn&#39;t any 3D geometry in there

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.500
Caption: there are no triangles there are no

00:29:31.798 --> 00:29:36.778
Caption: meshes there are no no quads no vertices

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:39.899
Caption: whatsoever that&#39;s all drawn effectively

00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:42.840
Caption: drawn to the screen and a call out to

00:29:39.899 --> 00:29:45.779
Caption: inio kiles who did the rainforest he&#39;s

00:29:42.839 --> 00:29:46.798
Caption: got a fantastic YouTube video on how we

00:29:45.779 --> 00:29:49.980
Caption: made that

00:29:46.798 --> 00:29:53.359
Caption: absolutely worth a watch

00:29:49.979 --> 00:29:53.359
Caption: and we&#39;ll get on to some more demos

00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:07.619
Caption: before I get too far and I just want to

00:30:04.918 --> 00:30:11.639
Caption: give a quick a quick sort of uh

00:30:07.619 --> 00:30:13.678
Caption: Shakedown of what what shaders are in a

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.359
Caption: typical 3D environment you have a mesh

00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:18.839
Caption: that&#39;s made up of vertices and some

00:30:15.359 --> 00:30:21.239
Caption: lines between them creating triangles

00:30:18.839 --> 00:30:22.979
Caption: then you can apply a material to it but

00:30:21.239 --> 00:30:25.020
Caption: of course the material doesn&#39;t have any

00:30:22.979 --> 00:30:27.119
Caption: value until you apply some light to it

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:29.279
Caption: so you get some light and you get a

00:30:27.119 --> 00:30:32.459
Caption: material you can then also provide some

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:33.960
Caption: directional lighting and some shading on

00:30:32.459 --> 00:30:36.599
Caption: the material

00:30:33.959 --> 00:30:39.239
Caption: it&#39;s all of them all of the material

00:30:36.599 --> 00:30:41.219
Caption: stuff is is the shadery bits is that

00:30:39.239 --> 00:30:42.119
Caption: we&#39;re going to be talking about so we&#39;re

00:30:41.219 --> 00:30:43.558
Caption: not going to worry about the vertices

00:30:42.119 --> 00:30:45.839
Caption: today we&#39;re just going to be talking

00:30:43.558 --> 00:30:50.418
Caption: about the shaders

00:30:45.839 --> 00:30:50.418
Caption: sorry about the the fragment Shader

00:30:50.699 --> 00:30:54.959
Caption: uh I&#39;m going to skip these examples

00:30:52.739 --> 00:30:57.239
Caption: because running low on time but head

00:30:54.959 --> 00:30:57.959
Caption: over to Shader toy to check those out

00:30:57.239 --> 00:30:59.819
Caption: because they&#39;re really really

00:30:57.959 --> 00:31:01.979
Caption: interesting

00:30:59.819 --> 00:31:05.038
Caption: um but the thing I really wanted to uh

00:31:01.979 --> 00:31:06.479
Caption: the the method or or the technique I

00:31:05.038 --> 00:31:08.699
Caption: wanted to share with you with regards to

00:31:06.479 --> 00:31:11.819
Caption: shaders is Ray marching that is how

00:31:08.699 --> 00:31:15.119
Caption: those images were done and it&#39;s a really

00:31:11.819 --> 00:31:17.099
Caption: interesting technique to apply to um to

00:31:15.119 --> 00:31:18.658
Caption: creative coding in general and it&#39;s you

00:31:17.099 --> 00:31:21.058
Caption: can use that to create proper scenes or

00:31:18.659 --> 00:31:23.760
Caption: you can create it create fractals and

00:31:21.058 --> 00:31:26.278
Caption: all sorts of interesting stuff with them

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.678
Caption: and the whole notion of it is

00:31:26.279 --> 00:31:31.200
Caption: um effectively looking at looking at a

00:31:28.678 --> 00:31:34.140
Caption: scene and measuring the distance between

00:31:31.199 --> 00:31:36.658
Caption: the camera and something in the scene

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:40.079
Caption: figuring out what&#39;s closer and rendering

00:31:36.659 --> 00:31:42.539
Caption: that and you render it pixel by pixel

00:31:40.079 --> 00:31:44.880
Caption: I think that&#39;s that&#39;s the key thing to

00:31:42.538 --> 00:31:46.859
Caption: to bear in mind with shaders is you are

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.440
Caption: not actually saying hey draw me a circle

00:31:46.859 --> 00:31:51.538
Caption: draw me a square draw me a cube you are

00:31:49.439 --> 00:31:55.019
Caption: saying I want this color at this color

00:31:51.538 --> 00:31:57.538
Caption: pixel at coordinate X Y to be this color

00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:00.419
Caption: uh and that is all very mathematically

00:31:57.538 --> 00:32:01.678
Caption: or can be very mathematically intensive

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:02.699
Caption: um so it&#39;s a bit more daunting to get

00:32:01.678 --> 00:32:03.719
Caption: into and we&#39;ll get into that a little

00:32:02.699 --> 00:32:07.019
Caption: bit

00:32:03.719 --> 00:32:08.579
Caption: um but Ray marching is a process of

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.979
Caption: um determining the distance between

00:32:08.579 --> 00:32:12.599
Caption: objects in the scene and your camera

00:32:10.979 --> 00:32:14.520
Caption: so I created this little sort of demo

00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:16.918
Caption: thing to sort of show how that might

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:20.219
Caption: work and I&#39;m going to turn off all those

00:32:16.918 --> 00:32:21.898
Caption: so say you started off with uh so you

00:32:20.219 --> 00:32:24.000
Caption: started off with your camera in the

00:32:21.899 --> 00:32:25.739
Caption: middle of the scene and we have array

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.359
Caption: that&#39;s going out from the scene

00:32:25.739 --> 00:32:29.459
Caption: now so you add some objects into the

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:31.079
Caption: scene right

00:32:29.459 --> 00:32:33.298
Caption: you want to you want to try and figure

00:32:31.079 --> 00:32:35.099
Caption: out which so if I&#39;m looking in this

00:32:33.298 --> 00:32:36.959
Caption: direction what am I supposed to render

00:32:35.099 --> 00:32:40.260
Caption: to the screen I&#39;m supposed to render

00:32:36.959 --> 00:32:42.798
Caption: number one at this particular pixel

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.798
Caption: so

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.760
Caption: how do we do that well we draw

00:32:45.538 --> 00:32:49.558
Caption: lines we try to we go through we Loop

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.779
Caption: through the entire area the entire scene

00:32:49.558 --> 00:32:54.599
Caption: and say well how far are you how far are

00:32:51.779 --> 00:32:55.619
Caption: you how far are you and you try to draw

00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:57.719
Caption: the closest but you don&#39;t want to draw

00:32:55.619 --> 00:32:59.399
Caption: it to the to the origin of that you want

00:32:57.719 --> 00:33:01.020
Caption: to draw it to the origin of the surface

00:32:59.399 --> 00:33:02.760
Caption: of that and that&#39;s where stuff gets

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:06.779
Caption: interesting because that uses sine

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:08.880
Caption: distance fields to calculate where the

00:33:06.779 --> 00:33:11.100
Caption: surface of it is based on what the

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:14.219
Caption: center or the origin is of that object

00:33:11.099 --> 00:33:16.918
Caption: and you do that iteratively so you take

00:33:14.219 --> 00:33:20.518
Caption: further and further steps as you get out

00:33:16.918 --> 00:33:22.619
Caption: into the into the scene to figure out

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:24.419
Caption: when you&#39;ve hit something so as you can

00:33:22.619 --> 00:33:25.859
Caption: see here I haven&#39;t actually hit anything

00:33:24.418 --> 00:33:27.119
Caption: because I haven&#39;t reached my minimum

00:33:25.859 --> 00:33:29.038
Caption: distance

00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:30.239
Caption: that I to get to the object haven&#39;t

00:33:29.038 --> 00:33:31.678
Caption: realized that hey I&#39;m actually at a

00:33:30.239 --> 00:33:33.839
Caption: surface

00:33:31.678 --> 00:33:35.398
Caption: but if you extend that further you start

00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:36.658
Caption: to see it

00:33:35.399 --> 00:33:38.399
Caption: expand

00:33:36.659 --> 00:33:40.519
Caption: and you can see where you&#39;re starting to

00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:44.880
Caption: actually hit things

00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:46.500
Caption: and you return that back to your uh back

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.719
Caption: to your code and you say I&#39;m going to

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.159
Caption: display pixel of this color at this

00:33:48.719 --> 00:33:52.260
Caption: coordinate

00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:54.720
Caption: so in a nutshell that is that is

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:57.000
Caption: remarking and that&#39;s used through

00:33:54.719 --> 00:33:59.778
Caption: each of through the rest of these these

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.779
Caption: um these examples

00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:08.638
Caption: I created a basic bootstrap Ray marching

00:34:04.859 --> 00:34:10.560
Caption: Shader which will be in in in the

00:34:08.638 --> 00:34:13.979
Caption: resources at the end of the slideshow

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:17.280
Caption: uh but essentially all it is is a basic

00:34:13.979 --> 00:34:20.459
Caption: uh algorithm to to do ray marching and

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.859
Caption: the magic here all happens if they

00:34:20.459 --> 00:34:25.199
Caption: forget the cult normal calculating

00:34:22.858 --> 00:34:29.039
Caption: um happens sort of here

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:31.500
Caption: and for this example the

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.119
Caption: the distance for a sphere

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:35.280
Caption: if you want to calculate the science

00:34:33.118 --> 00:34:38.158
Caption: distance field for the sphere is

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.839
Caption: calculated with this right now the

00:34:38.158 --> 00:34:42.178
Caption: benefit is you don&#39;t have to worry about

00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:44.040
Caption: having to work all this out some some

00:34:42.178 --> 00:34:46.020
Caption: very smart people have already worked

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.780
Caption: out assigned distance fields for almost

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:50.459
Caption: every shape you can think of you then

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.800
Caption: take those and combine them and you

00:34:50.459 --> 00:34:54.598
Caption: combine them using Boolean operators so

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.780
Caption: you can Union them you can subtract them

00:34:54.599 --> 00:35:00.300
Caption: you can multiply them or add them

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:03.900
Caption: and that&#39;s that&#39;s effectively how you

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:06.660
Caption: would create a scene and for example

00:35:03.899 --> 00:35:08.520
Caption: I created this for DDD Perth

00:35:06.659 --> 00:35:10.078
Caption: where

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.000
Caption: it&#39;s just some lights going around but

00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:15.000
Caption: there is no geometry in the scene right

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.679
Caption: this is all just I&#39;m picking a pixel uh

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.780
Caption: in a screen based on this distance for

00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:21.419
Caption: something and I can even show you what

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:24.060
Caption: that might look like if you take the the

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:26.159
Caption: O here for example

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:27.839
Caption: and this is when demo Gods strike me

00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:31.260
Caption: down

00:35:27.839 --> 00:35:34.020
Caption: uh so if I was to just return say

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:37.040
Caption: um the main o right so I&#39;m returning the

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.040
Caption: distance to the main o

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.180
Caption: so yeah there we go and let&#39;s get a

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.000
Caption: sphere because that&#39;s all I started off

00:35:42.179 --> 00:35:47.639
Caption: with but then what if I what if I

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.439
Caption: returned the minimum no actually I&#39;m

00:35:47.639 --> 00:35:52.199
Caption: going to do the maximum work

00:35:49.439 --> 00:35:57.919
Caption: uh for the maximum value

00:35:52.199 --> 00:35:57.919
Caption: of the main o and say the whole right

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:03.979
Caption: nope

00:36:00.479 --> 00:36:03.979
Caption: Oh wrong one not bad

00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:09.540
Caption: hold on let demigod strike me down

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:10.859
Caption: there we go

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:14.160
Caption: so what I&#39;ve done here is I&#39;ve

00:36:10.858 --> 00:36:15.539
Caption: effectively negated uh the the main o so

00:36:14.159 --> 00:36:19.319
Caption: the main o is no longer visible and only

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:21.479
Caption: the D&#39;s within it are right

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.800
Caption: but you can create a mask actually if I

00:36:21.479 --> 00:36:27.320
Caption: do mask

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.320
Caption: that might you know oops

00:36:29.579 --> 00:36:32.339
Caption: this is why you don&#39;t do live coding

00:36:31.139 --> 00:36:33.000
Caption: people

00:36:32.339 --> 00:36:34.500
Caption: um

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.879
Caption: so

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.099
Caption: by doing this what I&#39;ve done is I&#39;ve

00:36:35.879 --> 00:36:41.279
Caption: I&#39;ve created a an intersection between

00:36:38.099 --> 00:36:42.599
Caption: the O and the mask that I&#39;ve got for the

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.219
Caption: circle in the middle

00:36:42.599 --> 00:36:46.740
Caption: and that&#39;s how you would you would

00:36:44.219 --> 00:36:48.659
Caption: create a scene based out of

00:36:46.739 --> 00:36:51.540
Caption: uh these Primitives that you would

00:36:48.659 --> 00:36:54.000
Caption: create with sign distance fields

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:55.500
Caption: and it when you sort of when you start

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.780
Caption: to look at that you start to really

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.839
Caption: appreciate what some of these more

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.040
Caption: complex or complex images really take to

00:37:00.839 --> 00:37:05.460
Caption: to create

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:08.040
Caption: it&#39;s a far more

00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:10.219
Caption: I appreciate that experience a whole lot

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.219
Caption: more

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:15.900
Caption: of course the benefit is you can do

00:37:14.099 --> 00:37:17.520
Caption: stuff like this as well

00:37:15.899 --> 00:37:19.739
Caption: if you were to try and create this sort

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:22.800
Caption: of thing with a with traditional sort of

00:37:19.739 --> 00:37:24.060
Caption: 3D geometry uh your machine would be on

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.880
Caption: fire

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:29.339
Caption: um and and so but you can you can do

00:37:26.879 --> 00:37:31.259
Caption: this because you can do this in shaders

00:37:29.339 --> 00:37:33.000
Caption: because you&#39;re not affecting you&#39;re not

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:35.040
Caption: affecting geometry you are effectively

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.079
Caption: changing the shape of the environment

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.880
Caption: you&#39;re affecting the environment not the

00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:39.960
Caption: geometry itself so this is this this

00:37:38.879 --> 00:37:42.118
Caption: whole

00:37:39.959 --> 00:37:44.639
Caption: um field of spheres is created just by

00:37:42.118 --> 00:37:47.279
Caption: by applying a modulo

00:37:44.639 --> 00:37:50.659
Caption: to the sphere and it creates all of

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.659
Caption: these all these spheres

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:55.260
Caption: the the intersections or the uh The

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.219
Caption: Operators that I mentioned earlier and

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.020
Caption: because you&#39;re using sine distance

00:37:56.219 --> 00:38:00.540
Caption: Fields allow you to do cool stuff like

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:02.099
Caption: if this this thing is close to this

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.540
Caption: thing take this point in this point and

00:38:02.099 --> 00:38:04.619
Caption: if it&#39;s close enough together do

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:07.859
Caption: something with it and that&#39;s how you

00:38:04.618 --> 00:38:10.019
Caption: sort of get this uh this glob effect

00:38:07.858 --> 00:38:11.699
Caption: um I I&#39;m really Keen to try and make

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.320
Caption: this into sort of metabols type of thing

00:38:11.699 --> 00:38:15.598
Caption: or like a lava lamp I think that&#39;d be

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.920
Caption: pretty cool

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:19.500
Caption: um

00:38:16.919 --> 00:38:20.879
Caption: but you don&#39;t have to just do you don&#39;t

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.879
Caption: have to just do

00:38:20.879 --> 00:38:26.598
Caption: sort of shapes and stuff again another

00:38:23.879 --> 00:38:26.598
Caption: mathematical

00:38:26.939 --> 00:38:31.919
Caption: Ingenuity or another mathematical

00:38:28.858 --> 00:38:33.719
Caption: principle the mandelbrot set

00:38:31.919 --> 00:38:35.879
Caption: and it&#39;s a depiction of it just zooming

00:38:33.719 --> 00:38:39.780
Caption: in and it&#39;s

00:38:35.879 --> 00:38:39.779
Caption: constantly evolving

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.979
Caption: and shaders are really good at doing

00:38:41.219 --> 00:38:46.020
Caption: this because it you get to Leverage The

00:38:43.979 --> 00:38:47.820
Caption: GPU to process and crunch some of these

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.500
Caption: things which is really effective and you

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:52.079
Caption: get to do some cool stuff with distances

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.358
Caption: from from various places

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:58.099
Caption: so all those are all those available on

00:38:54.358 --> 00:38:58.098
Caption: Shader toy to take a look at

00:39:05.459 --> 00:39:08.179
Caption: nope

00:39:09.239 --> 00:39:12.239
Caption: nope

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:16.219
Caption: so that did it work did it work no

00:39:16.618 --> 00:39:21.179
Caption: it is changing here like it&#39;s changed

00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:25.400
Caption: it&#39;s kind of semi-changing there but I

00:39:21.179 --> 00:39:25.399
Caption: don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know man this is

00:39:25.439 --> 00:39:28.379
Caption: so you just goes to show you no matter

00:39:26.699 --> 00:39:29.879
Caption: how much you prepare tell you what

00:39:28.379 --> 00:39:31.858
Caption: just

00:39:29.879 --> 00:39:35.358
Caption: that uh

00:39:31.858 --> 00:39:35.358
Caption: do that and go back

00:39:35.579 --> 00:39:39.440
Caption: oh maybe I&#39;ve just got to do that

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:43.740
Caption: no it&#39;s just not moving at all

00:39:42.239 --> 00:39:45.919
Caption: like a moving slides here but it&#39;s not

00:39:43.739 --> 00:39:45.919
Caption: moving

00:39:49.618 --> 00:39:52.159
Caption: nope

00:39:55.199 --> 00:40:03.858
Caption: oh there we go that&#39;ll do it

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:03.859
Caption: uh all that five uh F5 we&#39;ll go back

00:40:05.459 --> 00:40:12.000
Caption: yay there you go so uh sorry about that

00:40:09.959 --> 00:40:13.320
Caption: Shader toy requires a shift in mindset

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.060
Caption: and I think that&#39;s the key takeaway for

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.640
Caption: Shader toy in particular it&#39;s definitely

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:20.640
Caption: not as approachable as something like

00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:24.239
Caption: p5.js it is mathematically intensive you

00:40:20.639 --> 00:40:27.118
Caption: do have to think about how how you want

00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:28.439
Caption: to solve problems and that can be a bit

00:40:27.118 --> 00:40:30.598
Caption: daunting but it can also be very

00:40:28.439 --> 00:40:33.179
Caption: rewarding as I personally prefer

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:36.000
Caption: creating stuff in in Shader toy and

00:40:33.179 --> 00:40:38.699
Caption: creating shaders they they just sort of

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.479
Caption: Tickle My Fancy I suppose

00:40:38.699 --> 00:40:41.280
Caption: um

00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:43.500
Caption: but it also offers great opportunities

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:46.500
Caption: so things like fractals for example and

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:48.358
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s fair field you just can&#39;t

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.879
Caption: realistically do that in something like

00:40:48.358 --> 00:40:54.118
Caption: ip5.js

00:40:50.879 --> 00:40:55.199
Caption: um and I like the challenge right

00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:57.299
Caption: but at the end of the day it&#39;s Different

00:40:55.199 --> 00:40:58.919
Caption: Strokes of different folks there is no

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.560
Caption: best tool

00:40:58.919 --> 00:41:05.598
Caption: so use whatever suits you so use

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:08.339
Caption: whichever is going to fulfill your needs

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:09.720
Caption: and think about what you want to create

00:41:08.339 --> 00:41:10.520
Caption: what is the best tool going to be for

00:41:09.719 --> 00:41:12.659
Caption: that

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:15.419
Caption: and more importantly I think try to

00:41:12.659 --> 00:41:18.000
Caption: Master One I&#39;ve tried to to sort of do

00:41:15.419 --> 00:41:20.459
Caption: both and that&#39;s been that&#39;s been a

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.379
Caption: challenge I I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve got very

00:41:20.459 --> 00:41:23.699
Caption: good at either of them I&#39;m still

00:41:22.379 --> 00:41:26.098
Caption: learning

00:41:23.699 --> 00:41:28.139
Caption: um so try to try to master one I&#39;ve seen

00:41:26.099 --> 00:41:29.400
Caption: I think some of that stuff that that

00:41:28.139 --> 00:41:30.539
Caption: I&#39;ve shown you today some of the other

00:41:29.399 --> 00:41:31.679
Caption: examples

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:34.739
Caption: um those are from people who have

00:41:31.679 --> 00:41:37.260
Caption: focused on on mastering one of them

00:41:34.739 --> 00:41:38.579
Caption: so the key takeaways for today uh you

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:40.739
Caption: don&#39;t have to be an artist to create art

00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:42.119
Caption: and I think it was Ralph Waldo Emerson

00:41:40.739 --> 00:41:43.339
Caption: who said every artist was first in

00:41:42.118 --> 00:41:47.459
Caption: amateur

00:41:43.339 --> 00:41:49.020
Caption: so like try it don&#39;t be scared to uh

00:41:47.459 --> 00:41:52.679
Caption: pick the tool that suits you

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:56.099
Caption: uh and experiment there is no right way

00:41:52.679 --> 00:41:57.598
Caption: to do it and the creative part of this I

00:41:56.099 --> 00:42:01.020
Caption: think is is the most important less so

00:41:57.599 --> 00:42:04.619
Caption: than the coding it&#39;s being feeling free

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:06.119
Caption: to try and do new things

00:42:04.618 --> 00:42:07.618
Caption: um I just want to call that that I&#39;ve

00:42:06.118 --> 00:42:08.879
Caption: all of this and everything I&#39;ve learned

00:42:07.618 --> 00:42:10.439
Caption: I&#39;ve been standing on the shoulders of

00:42:08.879 --> 00:42:11.598

00:42:18.899 --> 00:42:23.939
Caption: nature of code which is absolutely worth

00:42:20.699 --> 00:42:27.020
Caption: a read and in your keyless who is just a

00:42:23.939 --> 00:42:27.020

01:07:26.039 --> 01:07:28.979

01:07:28.979 --> 01:07:34.379

01:07:32.459 --> 01:07:36.838
Caption: but AI then

01:07:34.379 --> 01:07:39.719
Caption: AI is a term that floats around a lot

01:07:36.839 --> 01:07:41.819

Caption: world&#39;s problems which I mean it&#39;s great

01:07:44.579 --> 01:07:48.599

01:07:46.618 --> 01:07:52.078

01:07:58.799 --> 01:08:03.959

01:08:01.199 --> 01:08:05.760

01:08:03.959 --> 01:08:08.000

01:08:12.719 --> 01:08:16.020

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.060
Caption: learning and some of you might be aware

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:21.080

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:21.080

Caption: except

01:08:38.278 --> 01:08:42.718
Caption: we don&#39;t really need to talk about maths

01:08:40.379 --> 01:08:44.399
Caption: to talk about machine learning as much

01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:46.440

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:56.939
Caption: rush from your face as I mentioned the

01:08:52.679 --> 01:08:58.739
Caption: word maths can relax just a little bit

01:08:56.939 --> 01:09:01.080
Caption: but then that begs the question if we&#39;re

01:08:58.738 --> 01:09:03.899
Caption: not going to talk about maths

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:06.060
Caption: what are we going to talk about

01:09:03.899 --> 01:09:08.159

Caption: explicitly programmed to do so

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:26.219

01:09:26.219 --> 01:09:30.480

01:10:26.459 --> 01:10:29.640

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.560

01:10:37.379 --> 01:10:42.479

01:10:39.899 --> 01:10:44.279
Caption: might say machine learning is not just

01:10:42.479 --> 01:10:46.319
Caption: for Big Data

01:10:44.279 --> 01:10:48.299

01:10:48.299 --> 01:10:52.020

01:10:49.799 --> 01:10:54.000
Caption: which maybe Microsoft will get mad at me

01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:58.399

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.399

01:10:59.879 --> 01:11:03.919
Caption: if that&#39;s what machine learning is not

01:11:04.199 --> 01:11:08.400
Caption: then what is machine learning

01:11:06.959 --> 01:11:10.439
Caption: we&#39;re going to talk about what machine

01:11:08.399 --> 01:11:12.359
Caption: learning is and hopefully by the end of

01:11:10.439 --> 01:11:14.339
Caption: this you&#39;ll be able to come on me with

01:11:12.359 --> 01:11:15.959
Caption: the come with me on the journey to how

01:11:14.339 --> 01:11:16.919
Caption: we can create machine learning out of

01:11:15.959 --> 01:11:19.140
Caption: something

01:11:16.919 --> 01:11:20.520
Caption: stupid

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.020
Caption: machine learning is a way of

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.939
Caption: constructing a model that describes

01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:26.100
Caption: things about the real world without

01:11:23.939 --> 01:11:27.359
Caption: having to explicitly program it every

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:29.219
Caption: detail

01:11:27.359 --> 01:11:30.899
Caption: in a way it&#39;s about transferring

01:11:29.219 --> 01:11:32.580
Caption: Knowledge from the unknown from the

01:11:30.899 --> 01:11:34.859
Caption: known to the unknown

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:37.439
Caption: and we do this sort of learning in real

01:11:34.859 --> 01:11:40.139
Caption: day lives every day so much so that it&#39;s

01:11:37.439 --> 01:11:42.178
Caption: pretty much second nature

01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:44.280
Caption: when I was a kid I spent a lot of hours

01:11:42.179 --> 01:11:45.900
Caption: playing the guitar

01:11:44.279 --> 01:11:47.539
Caption: probably should have spent more hours

01:11:45.899 --> 01:11:50.698
Caption: doing my hair

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:53.040
Caption: this is the sacrifices we make right

01:11:50.699 --> 01:11:54.600
Caption: except for one time in high school where

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.280
Caption: we were auditioning for a musical which

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.939
Caption: the mic is important

01:11:56.279 --> 01:12:01.198
Caption: um and maybe five six upwards of that

01:11:59.939 --> 01:12:02.580
Caption: amount of people were trying to audition

01:12:01.199 --> 01:12:04.320
Caption: for guitar but no one was auditioning

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:05.820
Caption: for Bass and I said

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:07.198
Caption: how hard can it be going from six

01:12:05.819 --> 01:12:08.579
Caption: strings to four

01:12:07.199 --> 01:12:11.520
Caption: easy

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:13.140
Caption: except any musician who is tried to

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.819
Caption: transfer from guitar to Bass will know

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:16.620
Caption: that there are transferable skills

01:12:14.819 --> 01:12:19.139
Caption: there&#39;s a lot more knowledge that you

01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:21.780
Caption: need to gain before you can successfully

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:23.760
Caption: play the bass my first few performances

01:12:21.779 --> 01:12:26.879
Caption: I absolutely bombed

01:12:23.759 --> 01:12:28.259
Caption: I thought I started out thinking that I

01:12:26.879 --> 01:12:30.899
Caption: would have all my knowledge in guitar

01:12:28.259 --> 01:12:32.759
Caption: that would easily transfer it into

01:12:30.899 --> 01:12:34.819
Caption: um bass but this wasn&#39;t the case it was

01:12:32.759 --> 01:12:37.799
Caption: only after successive practicing

01:12:34.819 --> 01:12:40.520
Caption: learnings failings that I managed to get

01:12:37.799 --> 01:12:40.520
Caption: to where I am today

01:12:41.879 --> 01:12:45.799
Caption: put it another way let&#39;s assume we have

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:48.238
Caption: a group of people much like yourselves

01:12:45.799 --> 01:12:49.559
Caption: tasked with predicting the result of a

01:12:48.238 --> 01:12:52.139
Caption: coin flip

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:54.839
Caption: and for every correct guess you get a

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:56.100
Caption: cookie that&#39;s just so that we make sure

01:12:54.839 --> 01:12:58.198
Caption: that people take this very serious

01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:00.060
Caption: experiment seriously

01:12:58.199 --> 01:13:02.520
Caption: without prior knowledge except for the

01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:04.199
Caption: fact that maybe a coin has two sides I

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:06.719
Caption: think we can agree within a certain

01:13:04.199 --> 01:13:08.580
Caption: margin of error that 50 of the group

01:13:06.719 --> 01:13:12.719
Caption: will get a cookie

01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:15.359
Caption: so we run this one flip turns up heads

01:13:12.719 --> 01:13:18.060
Caption: two flips turns up heads

01:13:15.359 --> 01:13:20.759
Caption: three flips heads and what a coincidence

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:21.899
Caption: some might say others might start to

01:13:20.759 --> 01:13:24.238
Caption: catch on

01:13:21.899 --> 01:13:27.178
Caption: four flips turns up heads

01:13:24.238 --> 01:13:28.738
Caption: five flips turns up heads and a group

01:13:27.179 --> 01:13:32.159
Caption: start might start getting suspicious

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:34.799
Caption: cookies are flying left and right

01:13:32.159 --> 01:13:36.659
Caption: given enough time people will learn the

01:13:34.799 --> 01:13:39.419
Caption: ploy of this con man

01:13:36.659 --> 01:13:42.719
Caption: tis No Ordinary coin

01:13:39.419 --> 01:13:45.359
Caption: the group starts around here 50 percent

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:46.980
Caption: but then with successive coin flips and

01:13:45.359 --> 01:13:49.919
Caption: the promise of cookies getting ever more

01:13:46.979 --> 01:13:52.439
Caption: enticing we start to learn with coin&#39;s

01:13:49.919 --> 01:13:54.899
Caption: true nature nature

01:13:52.439 --> 01:13:56.520
Caption: by guessing and getting it wrong or

01:13:54.899 --> 01:13:59.479
Caption: guessing and getting it right and being

01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:02.339
Caption: rewarded constantly over and over again

01:13:59.479 --> 01:14:04.679
Caption: we can start to induce that the

01:14:02.339 --> 01:14:06.738
Caption: information is not that the coin is a

01:14:04.679 --> 01:14:10.100
Caption: regular coin but it is a double-sided

01:14:06.738 --> 01:14:10.099
Caption: double-headed coin

01:14:10.799 --> 01:14:16.198
Caption: so

01:14:13.379 --> 01:14:18.479
Caption: what is that how can we abstract that

01:14:16.199 --> 01:14:21.179
Caption: away from that experience of us learning

01:14:18.479 --> 01:14:23.459
Caption: after successive coin flips and apply it

01:14:21.179 --> 01:14:25.500
Caption: to Something in the maths world or the

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:27.419
Caption: computer world

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:29.719
Caption: there are many types of machine learning

01:14:27.419 --> 01:14:32.040
Caption: that you might have heard of supervised

01:14:29.719 --> 01:14:33.659
Caption: unsupervised reinforcement learning

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.819
Caption: semi-supervised

01:14:33.659 --> 01:14:39.800
Caption: but fundamentally they all follow the

01:14:35.819 --> 01:14:39.799
Caption: same three basic steps

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:46.679
Caption: we need to create a test

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:48.600
Caption: what is the model trying to do

01:14:46.679 --> 01:14:49.560
Caption: we need to define a way to score the

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.840
Caption: test

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:54.419
Caption: how well do we how do we tell if a model

01:14:51.839 --> 01:14:57.359
Caption: is good or bad or what it&#39;s trying to do

01:14:54.419 --> 01:14:59.279
Caption: and lastly most importantly we need to

01:14:57.359 --> 01:15:02.158
Caption: find a way to punish or reward the model

01:14:59.279 --> 01:15:04.619
Caption: for the score it received

01:15:02.159 --> 01:15:06.659
Caption: so again the idea here is that if we

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:08.640
Caption: take the fundamental components of what

01:15:06.659 --> 01:15:11.159
Caption: a machine learning algorithm is

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:13.979
Caption: stripping away all the maths complexity

01:15:11.159 --> 01:15:16.140
Caption: and high compute power we can find ways

01:15:13.979 --> 01:15:17.759
Caption: to implement it in something simple and

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:19.500
Caption: we need to know these steps if we&#39;re

01:15:17.759 --> 01:15:22.979
Caption: going to build an AI from the ground up

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:25.560
Caption: with machine learning in say

01:15:22.979 --> 01:15:27.779
Caption: a PowerPoint maybe I don&#39;t know is that

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:29.339
Caption: why you&#39;re here

01:15:27.779 --> 01:15:31.079
Caption: indulge me for a minute while we walk

01:15:29.339 --> 01:15:32.939
Caption: down metaphor Lane

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:34.859
Caption: we&#39;re going to open up Brenton School of

01:15:32.939 --> 01:15:37.319
Caption: machine learning studies

01:15:34.859 --> 01:15:40.619
Caption: in this school we have students day in

01:15:37.319 --> 01:15:43.439
Caption: day out trying to produce results

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:46.260
Caption: school is the model and our students are

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:48.600
Caption: just instances of training that model

01:15:46.259 --> 01:15:50.158
Caption: get this school to learn and perform in

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:52.140
Caption: one of the top schools

01:15:50.159 --> 01:15:54.300
Caption: we need to define a test

01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:56.580
Caption: this test is how we&#39;re going to judge

01:15:54.299 --> 01:15:58.319
Caption: how well the school performs when we

01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:00.839
Caption: conduct tests each student will get a

01:15:58.319 --> 01:16:02.520
Caption: score and our student score is and our

01:16:00.839 --> 01:16:03.899
Caption: school score is some aggregation of the

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.459
Caption: student score

01:16:03.899 --> 01:16:07.319
Caption: who doesn&#39;t love standardized tests

01:16:05.459 --> 01:16:09.359
Caption: right

01:16:07.319 --> 01:16:11.279
Caption: after the test we need to Define what it

01:16:09.359 --> 01:16:12.718
Caption: means to pass or fail it

01:16:11.279 --> 01:16:14.698
Caption: what does it mean for a student to do

01:16:12.719 --> 01:16:17.280
Caption: well in the test what is a good score

01:16:14.699 --> 01:16:19.560
Caption: what is a bad score for the school

01:16:17.279 --> 01:16:20.698
Caption: what will end us end up in US losing

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:23.120
Caption: your funding and turning off the lights

01:16:20.699 --> 01:16:23.120
Caption: forever

01:16:23.699 --> 01:16:28.380
Caption: lastly we need to Define how we&#39;re going

01:16:26.759 --> 01:16:32.158
Caption: to punish the students who have failed

01:16:28.379 --> 01:16:34.259
Caption: and reward those who did well

01:16:32.159 --> 01:16:36.239
Caption: this is a standardized test and again

01:16:34.259 --> 01:16:38.158
Caption: our school will be based off the

01:16:36.238 --> 01:16:39.839
Caption: aggregated score of all of our students

01:16:38.159 --> 01:16:41.280
Caption: so we want to maximize the amount of

01:16:39.839 --> 01:16:44.718
Caption: students passing

01:16:41.279 --> 01:16:44.718
Caption: by whatever means necessary

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:50.939
Caption: and we do this many many times

01:16:48.959 --> 01:16:52.679
Caption: each time a student is getting punished

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:55.859
Caption: if it gets the test wrong or it&#39;s

01:16:52.679 --> 01:16:57.780
Caption: getting rewarded if it&#39;s doing it better

01:16:55.859 --> 01:16:59.520
Caption: it&#39;s important to note here that the

01:16:57.779 --> 01:17:01.619
Caption: students are the one learning after each

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:04.260
Caption: test they are what makes this machine

01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:07.739
Caption: learning school a machine learning model

01:17:04.259 --> 01:17:09.419
Caption: and you can&#39;t just go ahead and reward

01:17:07.738 --> 01:17:11.099
Caption: or punish your school in as a whole

01:17:09.419 --> 01:17:12.479
Caption: anyone who&#39;s tried to organize any group

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:14.820
Caption: of kids will know that that&#39;s just not

01:17:12.479 --> 01:17:17.100
Caption: possible what you do have control over

01:17:14.819 --> 01:17:19.259
Caption: is the individual students running their

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:23.159
Caption: tests and you have the ability to learn

01:17:19.259 --> 01:17:25.339
Caption: to get them to learn or change their

01:17:23.159 --> 01:17:25.340
Caption: scores

01:17:25.439 --> 01:17:29.879
Caption: now you might say a different approach

01:17:27.779 --> 01:17:32.339
Caption: to this is to try and get every student

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:35.698
Caption: to memorize the answer of every single

01:17:32.339 --> 01:17:37.139
Caption: test question in the test which yes it&#39;s

01:17:35.699 --> 01:17:39.840
Caption: an option it will get a pretty good

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:41.520
Caption: score but then say a new school board

01:17:39.839 --> 01:17:43.678
Caption: runs around and says we don&#39;t like this

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.419
Caption: test we&#39;re going to define a new one all

01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:47.580
Caption: of a sudden you have to do all of the

01:17:45.419 --> 01:17:49.500
Caption: rework and getting all of these hundreds

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:52.199
Caption: thousands of students in the school to

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.939
Caption: relearn their answers it&#39;s not efficient

01:17:52.199 --> 01:17:57.840
Caption: and I know that I can&#39;t memorize a

01:17:53.939 --> 01:18:00.359
Caption: standardized test for the best of days

01:17:57.839 --> 01:18:03.479
Caption: the key thing here is that you can run a

01:18:00.359 --> 01:18:05.759
Caption: test on any model but if there exists no

01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:08.040
Caption: process to punish or reward the model

01:18:05.759 --> 01:18:11.039
Caption: based on the test score then it&#39;s simply

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:12.959
Caption: not a machine learning model

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.699
Caption: so that&#39;s a little bit of fun down

01:18:12.959 --> 01:18:16.198
Caption: metaphor Lane but let&#39;s look at this in

01:18:14.699 --> 01:18:17.760
Caption: the real world

01:18:16.199 --> 01:18:20.880
Caption: what you&#39;re looking at here is an

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:22.500
Caption: example of the mnist data set it&#39;s sort

01:18:20.879 --> 01:18:24.540
Caption: of said as the hello world of computer

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:27.679
Caption: vision whatever that&#39;s worth

01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:30.439
Caption: data set containing 70 000 labeled

01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:33.840
Caption: handwritten digits

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:36.238
Caption: uh 10 60 000 of those are training and

01:18:33.839 --> 01:18:37.979
Caption: ten thousand of those are testing

01:18:36.238 --> 01:18:40.979
Caption: the name of the game is to get a model

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:44.279
Caption: that classifies an unseen hand written

01:18:40.979 --> 01:18:45.839
Caption: digit as zero through to nine

01:18:44.279 --> 01:18:48.959
Caption: so in this case our test is pretty

01:18:45.839 --> 01:18:52.319
Caption: simple is the predicted digit equal to

01:18:48.959 --> 01:18:54.779
Caption: the actual labeled digit

01:18:52.319 --> 01:18:56.339
Caption: so if we try and approach this in the

01:18:54.779 --> 01:18:58.500
Caption: simplest way possible

01:18:56.339 --> 01:19:00.119
Caption: our first model might be

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.580
Caption: random guess

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:04.320
Caption: this is about as simple as we can get we

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:07.140
Caption: just simply ran get randomly guess a

01:19:04.319 --> 01:19:09.479
Caption: number between 0 and 9 and assign the

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:11.219
Caption: label to be that

01:19:09.479 --> 01:19:13.439
Caption: this model is quite easy to test

01:19:11.219 --> 01:19:15.239
Caption: actually in fact if we did it then we

01:19:13.439 --> 01:19:17.520
Caption: would find that it&#39;s about 10 accurate

01:19:15.238 --> 01:19:21.359
Caption: and that&#39;s much like guessing a random

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.679
Caption: coin is 50 right accurate

01:19:21.359 --> 01:19:25.619
Caption: however

01:19:22.679 --> 01:19:27.959
Caption: we have no way to change the model&#39;s

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:30.419
Caption: behavior when it gets things right or we

01:19:27.959 --> 01:19:33.419
Caption: can&#39;t alter it when it gets things wrong

01:19:30.419 --> 01:19:34.500
Caption: our model&#39;s accuracy will always be 10

01:19:33.419 --> 01:19:36.899
Caption: percent

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:39.000
Caption: hence I&#39;m a model is not a machine

01:19:36.899 --> 01:19:43.080
Caption: learning model

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.719
Caption: so 10 percent not that great one in

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:48.600
Caption: every 10 digit gets it wrong

01:19:45.719 --> 01:19:50.340
Caption: so let&#39;s try a better approach

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:54.000
Caption: this time we&#39;re going to relate a model

01:19:50.339 --> 01:19:56.520
Caption: to the image&#39;s darkness which might seem

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.738
Caption: a bit strange but you might expect an

01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:00.419
Caption: image of an 8 to be darker than an image

01:19:58.738 --> 01:20:01.919
Caption: of a one and maybe a little bit darker

01:20:00.419 --> 01:20:03.959
Caption: of an image of a three

01:20:01.919 --> 01:20:05.759
Caption: it&#39;s more ink involved so there&#39;s more

01:20:03.959 --> 01:20:07.620
Caption: Darkness

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:09.539
Caption: this model is a little bit better in

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:12.000
Caption: practice we see that the accuracy

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:14.159
Caption: averages to about 22 percent which is

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.040
Caption: twice as good as randomly guessing

01:20:14.159 --> 01:20:19.080
Caption: but it&#39;s still only one in four one in

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.939
Caption: five getting it right

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:24.199
Caption: I think

01:20:20.939 --> 01:20:24.198
Caption: we can do better than that

01:20:24.238 --> 01:20:28.619
Caption: crucially again there was no way to

01:20:26.939 --> 01:20:31.140
Caption: alter the model&#39;s Behavior

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:33.060
Caption: when it&#39;s dark and it predicts it to be

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:35.280
Caption: an eight it&#39;ll always do that regardless

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:38.100
Caption: if it was just a really heavily uh

01:20:35.279 --> 01:20:39.839
Caption: highlighted five

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:42.359
Caption: so let&#39;s see if we can apply what we

01:20:39.839 --> 01:20:46.040
Caption: just learned in the school metaphor for

01:20:42.359 --> 01:20:46.040
Caption: for creating machine learning algorithms

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:50.879
Caption: don&#39;t worry about the code in two

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.800
Caption: details this is an extract taken from a

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:54.359
Caption: book that I dearly love called neural

01:20:52.799 --> 01:20:56.158
Caption: networks in deep learning by Michael

01:20:54.359 --> 01:20:58.619
Caption: Nielsen

01:20:56.159 --> 01:21:00.540
Caption: for those interested this is uh what

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.560
Caption: this is again what we call a neural

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:04.500
Caption: network

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:06.839
Caption: but crucially what this has is what the

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:09.359
Caption: other two models didn&#39;t it has a way to

01:21:06.839 --> 01:21:10.379
Caption: reward good test scores and punish bad

01:21:09.359 --> 01:21:13.198
Caption: ones

01:21:10.379 --> 01:21:15.959
Caption: every times it runs its own tests it&#39;ll

01:21:13.199 --> 01:21:18.239
Caption: find a way to calculate how different

01:21:15.959 --> 01:21:19.919
Caption: the predicted value was from the

01:21:18.238 --> 01:21:22.198
Caption: expected value

01:21:19.919 --> 01:21:26.000
Caption: and then alter the model in some way

01:21:22.199 --> 01:21:26.000
Caption: that favors the way that it got it right

01:21:26.219 --> 01:21:31.679
Caption: the key magic in here is uh we&#39;re feed

01:21:28.679 --> 01:21:33.060
Caption: forward back propagation approach this

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:36.239
Caption: takes the output of a cost function

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:37.979
Caption: cross entropy in this case to test how

01:21:36.238 --> 01:21:40.500
Caption: how different the prediction was from

01:21:37.979 --> 01:21:43.379
Caption: the expected and it Alters the model uh

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:45.600
Caption: based on stochastic gradient descent

01:21:43.379 --> 01:21:47.339
Caption: which honestly it&#39;s pretty simple it&#39;s

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.899
Caption: just based on the train rule of deriving

01:21:47.339 --> 01:21:52.459
Caption: matrices

01:21:48.899 --> 01:21:52.459
Caption: except I said no maths

01:21:52.738 --> 01:21:55.698
Caption: I&#39;ll breathe

01:21:55.919 --> 01:21:59.939
Caption: the model here is a machine learning

01:21:59.159 --> 01:22:02.820
Caption: model

01:21:59.939 --> 01:22:06.000
Caption: it had a test the is the predicted value

01:22:02.819 --> 01:22:08.218
Caption: equal to the actual labeled digit

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.379
Caption: it has a way of determining a good or

01:22:08.219 --> 01:22:12.420
Caption: bad score in this case I said it was the

01:22:10.379 --> 01:22:14.399
Caption: cross entropy function

01:22:12.419 --> 01:22:17.819
Caption: and it has a way of altering the model&#39;s

01:22:14.399 --> 01:22:19.500
Caption: Behavior the stochastic gradient descent

01:22:17.819 --> 01:22:20.819
Caption: you don&#39;t have to know how it works you

01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:22.859
Caption: just have to know that it&#39;s there and

01:22:20.819 --> 01:22:25.079
Caption: there&#39;s a method of applying this

01:22:22.859 --> 01:22:26.158
Caption: punishment or reward

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.839
Caption: thank you

01:22:26.159 --> 01:22:30.479
Caption: but

01:22:27.839 --> 01:22:31.738
Caption: the mnist is a pretty typical example I

01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:33.000
Caption: said it was like the hello world of

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:35.639
Caption: computer vision

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.839
Caption: in it we had a very clear labeled

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.459
Caption: objective

01:22:36.839 --> 01:22:40.560
Caption: if our model

01:22:38.459 --> 01:22:43.259
Caption: didn&#39;t predict the correct label for the

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:45.899
Caption: digit then it&#39;s not up to scratch

01:22:43.259 --> 01:22:47.759
Caption: sometimes the test and the score aren&#39;t

01:22:45.899 --> 01:22:49.919
Caption: so clear-cut

01:22:47.759 --> 01:22:52.500
Caption: the interesting examples in the industry

01:22:49.919 --> 01:22:54.959
Caption: around the test isn&#39;t so clear and a bad

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:58.319
Caption: score is equally just as vague

01:22:54.959 --> 01:23:00.738
Caption: see labeling digits is easy

01:22:58.319 --> 01:23:03.779
Caption: but what about if you&#39;re trying to just

01:23:00.738 --> 01:23:05.939
Caption: transcribe somebody&#39;s piano playing and

01:23:03.779 --> 01:23:07.979
Caption: as an audio file and transcribe that

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:10.140
Caption: into manuscript music that somebody

01:23:07.979 --> 01:23:13.620
Caption: would read

01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:15.000
Caption: this is a paper uh called onsets and

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:17.159
Caption: Frames dual objective piano

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.120
Caption: transcription and they try to do just

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:20.880
Caption: that

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:23.040
Caption: now the paper is full of fun maths and

01:23:20.879 --> 01:23:24.718
Caption: data science jargon but the point of

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:26.280
Caption: Interest here is when the authors tried

01:23:24.719 --> 01:23:29.340
Caption: to describe how they base the model

01:23:26.279 --> 01:23:31.439
Caption: accuracy for velocity

01:23:29.339 --> 01:23:33.479
Caption: as they say it&#39;s been a pretty hard nut

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:35.339
Caption: to crack I mean sure you can tell if a

01:23:33.479 --> 01:23:37.439
Caption: note written on paper is the same as the

01:23:35.339 --> 01:23:39.599
Caption: note what was played you can even test

01:23:37.439 --> 01:23:41.580
Caption: whether the transcribe for note falls on

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:43.739
Caption: the same beat give or take

01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:45.179
Caption: but how do you capture Dynamics volume

01:23:43.738 --> 01:23:47.879
Caption: expression

01:23:45.179 --> 01:23:49.500
Caption: a note pitch is a note pitch but what

01:23:47.879 --> 01:23:51.959
Caption: reference does a note&#39;s loudness have

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:53.100
Caption: who&#39;s to say the recording just isn&#39;t

01:23:51.959 --> 01:23:54.959
Caption: really loud or there&#39;s a lot of

01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:57.600
Caption: background noise

01:23:54.959 --> 01:23:59.339
Caption: additionally how do you correct a given

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.899
Caption: notes volume based on the content when

01:23:59.339 --> 01:24:02.639
Caption: the context that it appears in is

01:24:00.899 --> 01:24:04.979
Caption: arguably more important

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:05.880
Caption: a soft note compared to a really loud

01:24:04.979 --> 01:24:08.279
Caption: note

01:24:05.879 --> 01:24:11.580
Caption: has different uh meanings than if you

01:24:08.279 --> 01:24:14.639
Caption: just have a sequence of soft notes

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:16.439
Caption: so I love academic papers the authors

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:18.419
Caption: are kind of hand wavy at this point

01:24:16.439 --> 01:24:20.339
Caption: they&#39;re saying that they&#39;ve discovered a

01:24:18.419 --> 01:24:21.658
Caption: never-before-seen method to truly test

01:24:20.339 --> 01:24:23.718
Caption: whether their model perfectly

01:24:21.659 --> 01:24:26.880
Caption: transcribes the Dynamics of a player

01:24:23.719 --> 01:24:29.400
Caption: Forte fortissimo piano

01:24:26.879 --> 01:24:31.919
Caption: however it&#39;s important to note that all

01:24:29.399 --> 01:24:33.600
Caption: that&#39;s been done is some math magic to

01:24:31.919 --> 01:24:36.238
Caption: calculate a score based on the average

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:38.640
Caption: volume of the recording

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:42.419
Caption: they didn&#39;t discover any brand new

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:45.179
Caption: method they simply defined a test

01:24:42.419 --> 01:24:46.738
Caption: the test could have easily been all

01:24:45.179 --> 01:24:48.719
Caption: notes of the correct volume if they&#39;re

01:24:46.738 --> 01:24:50.339
Caption: below negative five decibels

01:24:48.719 --> 01:24:52.020
Caption: that&#39;s a test and the model would have

01:24:50.339 --> 01:24:53.459
Caption: been really good at transcribing all

01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:56.000
Caption: notes that are below negative five

01:24:53.459 --> 01:24:56.000
Caption: decibels

01:24:59.279 --> 01:25:03.959
Caption: so these are the three key things that

01:25:01.979 --> 01:25:05.159
Caption: we&#39;ve got to keep in our minds moving

01:25:03.959 --> 01:25:07.259
Caption: forward

01:25:05.159 --> 01:25:08.939
Caption: to have a machine learning model you

01:25:07.259 --> 01:25:11.579
Caption: have to have a test

01:25:08.939 --> 01:25:13.799
Caption: school and then a way to punish or

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:16.140
Caption: reward based on that score

01:25:13.799 --> 01:25:18.779
Caption: sometimes these are pretty easy to

01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:20.880
Caption: understand say for example if is your

01:25:18.779 --> 01:25:23.218
Caption: digit equal to the labeled digit

01:25:20.879 --> 01:25:25.020
Caption: sometimes it can be a bit more vague in

01:25:23.219 --> 01:25:27.300
Caption: the case of when you&#39;re trying to

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:28.260
Caption: transcribe music notes or when you&#39;re

01:25:27.299 --> 01:25:31.939
Caption: trying to

01:25:28.259 --> 01:25:31.939
Caption: play Tic-Tac-Toe for example

01:25:35.159 --> 01:25:40.860
Caption: so that was a lot

01:25:38.219 --> 01:25:42.900
Caption: but this creates the fundamentals of

01:25:40.859 --> 01:25:45.000
Caption: what we&#39;re going to use as we go through

01:25:42.899 --> 01:25:46.799
Caption: the Journey on how you might do

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.439
Caption: something strange

01:25:46.799 --> 01:25:52.379
Caption: see machine learning is more than just

01:25:49.439 --> 01:25:54.359
Caption: classification and regression

01:25:52.379 --> 01:25:57.238
Caption: learning can be used in any application

01:25:54.359 --> 01:25:59.759
Caption: that uses the three key principles when

01:25:57.238 --> 01:26:01.859
Caption: you define a test when you calculate a

01:25:59.759 --> 01:26:04.738
Caption: score and then provide some sort of

01:26:01.859 --> 01:26:07.619
Caption: punishment or reward

01:26:04.738 --> 01:26:09.718
Caption: and if you don&#39;t believe me well

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:13.459
Caption: this is where the fun comes in

01:26:09.719 --> 01:26:15.120
Caption: training and AI to play Tic-tac-toe

01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:17.520
Caption: except

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:19.199
Caption: that might not really get you convinced

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:21.719
Caption: right maybe I&#39;m just going to pull out

01:26:19.199 --> 01:26:24.179
Caption: my Python and do some math magic and

01:26:21.719 --> 01:26:25.800
Caption: then that doesn&#39;t convince you at all

01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:27.540
Caption: what about if we tried to find a

01:26:25.799 --> 01:26:29.459
Caption: scenario in which we didn&#39;t have any of

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:34.280
Caption: that available to us we don&#39;t have any

01:26:29.459 --> 01:26:34.279
Caption: code we don&#39;t have any fancy compute

01:26:34.679 --> 01:26:40.800
Caption: yeah I think this will do a better job

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:42.060
Caption: I mentioned before Arthur Samuel who

01:26:40.799 --> 01:26:45.299
Caption: spent a large part of his career

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:47.159
Caption: utilizing the best IBM computers at the

01:26:45.299 --> 01:26:49.138
Caption: time to create revolutionary new machine

01:26:47.159 --> 01:26:50.699
Caption: learning programs

01:26:49.139 --> 01:26:52.139
Caption: I wonder what he&#39;d think if he saw his

01:26:50.699 --> 01:26:54.679
Caption: whole what life&#39;s work reduced to a

01:26:52.139 --> 01:26:54.679
Caption: slide deck

01:26:54.959 --> 01:27:00.479
Caption: now in true typical consultant fashion I

01:26:58.738 --> 01:27:01.859
Caption: will label some caveats here and really

01:27:00.479 --> 01:27:03.899
Caption: Define the scope of what we&#39;re going to

01:27:01.859 --> 01:27:05.759
Caption: be working with

01:27:03.899 --> 01:27:07.500
Caption: the aim of the game is to demonstrate

01:27:05.759 --> 01:27:09.238
Caption: that machine learning is no more

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:12.600
Caption: complicated than any other algorithm

01:27:09.238 --> 01:27:13.738
Caption: once stripped down to its fundamentals

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.719
Caption: hence

01:27:13.738 --> 01:27:18.779
Caption: no code is allowed

01:27:15.719 --> 01:27:21.179
Caption: now full disclosure I did use some

01:27:18.779 --> 01:27:24.718
Caption: macros as you will soon see to get this

01:27:21.179 --> 01:27:26.400
Caption: working involved many slides and

01:27:24.719 --> 01:27:29.780
Caption: many

01:27:26.399 --> 01:27:33.060
Caption: many animations so

01:27:29.779 --> 01:27:34.738
Caption: to save myself an eternity I hacked some

01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:37.319
Caption: old VBA scripts to automate the

01:27:34.738 --> 01:27:39.000
Caption: insertion of animations and slides we

01:27:37.319 --> 01:27:40.738
Caption: will not be using these in the method

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.259
Caption: for training the PowerPoint I want to

01:27:40.738 --> 01:27:46.019
Caption: make that very clear

01:27:43.259 --> 01:27:50.299
Caption: secondly for the game theorists out

01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:53.659
Caption: there there is about uh 255

01:27:50.299 --> 01:27:55.979
Caption: 168 possible games of tic-tac-toe

01:27:53.659 --> 01:27:57.420
Caption: this number varies slightly depending on

01:27:55.979 --> 01:27:59.218
Caption: how you define what a game of

01:27:57.419 --> 01:28:01.500
Caption: tic-tac-toe is but needless to say

01:27:59.219 --> 01:28:03.780
Caption: that&#39;s a very big number

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:05.639
Caption: um so to narrow this down I&#39;ve reduced

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:09.779
Caption: the problem to training a PowerPoint

01:28:05.639 --> 01:28:11.959
Caption: tic-tac-toe to win in three moves or

01:28:09.779 --> 01:28:15.599
Caption: more likely it&#39;s uh training a

01:28:11.959 --> 01:28:17.580
Caption: tic-tac-toe to not lose in three moves

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.780
Caption: but you know that doesn&#39;t that&#39;s not as

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:21.300
Caption: catchy

01:28:18.779 --> 01:28:24.119
Caption: in addition the AI will always make the

01:28:21.299 --> 01:28:26.520
Caption: first move and always in a corner

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:28.320
Caption: see the game of tic-tac-toe actually

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:30.179
Caption: varies quite significantly depending on

01:28:28.319 --> 01:28:32.579
Caption: which player goes first so we&#39;re going

01:28:30.179 --> 01:28:35.060
Caption: to just highlight one example of this

01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:35.060
Caption: game state

01:28:35.339 --> 01:28:40.198
Caption: where possible we&#39;ll utilize Reflections

01:28:37.738 --> 01:28:41.819
Caption: and rotations so that a computer will

01:28:40.199 --> 01:28:43.920
Caption: never make a move that is a reflection

01:28:41.819 --> 01:28:45.060
Caption: or rotation of another state that it can

01:28:43.919 --> 01:28:47.399
Caption: move to

01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:49.500
Caption: what does that mean in this example

01:28:47.399 --> 01:28:51.359
Caption: there are only three places that an AI

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:53.399
Caption: will try to place

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:56.158
Caption: itself

01:28:53.399 --> 01:28:58.859
Caption: the left the bottom left and then the

01:28:56.159 --> 01:29:00.840
Caption: bottom this is because the other blank

01:28:58.859 --> 01:29:03.419
Caption: spaces are just reflections of those

01:29:00.839 --> 01:29:05.339
Caption: moves the right and bottom right are

01:29:03.419 --> 01:29:07.520
Caption: just reflections of the left and bottom

01:29:05.339 --> 01:29:07.520
Caption: left

01:29:07.738 --> 01:29:11.959
Caption: us human players will have no such

01:29:09.359 --> 01:29:11.959
Caption: restrictions

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.759
Caption: this leaves us with a still not tiny

01:29:15.179 --> 01:29:19.380
Caption: number of

01:29:16.759 --> 01:29:22.259
Caption: 1830 possible game states that you can

01:29:19.379 --> 01:29:25.500
Caption: have for Tic-tac-toe

01:29:22.259 --> 01:29:28.019
Caption: I&#39;ll take the time here to thank The

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:30.540
Caption: Inspirations uh that cursed me with this

01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:32.580
Caption: project first was the work by

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:34.560
Caption: mathematician and comedian there are

01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:36.540
Caption: some of us who are funny by the name of

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:38.040
Caption: Matt Parker who ran a project and

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.899
Caption: training a machine learning algorithm to

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:42.179
Caption: play Tic-Tac-Toe based on a set of

01:29:39.899 --> 01:29:45.359
Caption: matchboxes and this was off the work of

01:29:42.179 --> 01:29:47.400
Caption: Donald Mickey in 1961.

01:29:45.359 --> 01:29:48.718
Caption: if you ask me they&#39;re kind of cheating a

01:29:47.399 --> 01:29:51.060
Caption: little bit they only have to deal with

01:29:48.719 --> 01:29:53.280
Caption: this approximately 700 possible states

01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:55.500
Caption: that the tic-tac-toe board can be in and

01:29:53.279 --> 01:29:58.799
Caption: there was a lot of human intervention so

01:29:55.500 --> 01:30:01.319
Caption: you know like throwing any shade but

01:29:58.799 --> 01:30:03.899
Caption: the second uh was a video by Tom

01:30:01.319 --> 01:30:06.299
Caption: wilderheim who really opened my eyes to

01:30:03.899 --> 01:30:09.419
Caption: the programming potential of PowerPoint

01:30:06.299 --> 01:30:11.819
Caption: in his absurd ideas in computer science

01:30:09.419 --> 01:30:13.859
Caption: PowerPoint programming it&#39;s a great

01:30:11.819 --> 01:30:16.738
Caption: watch

01:30:13.859 --> 01:30:19.439
Caption: so PowerPoint then

01:30:16.738 --> 01:30:20.519
Caption: now I&#39;ve heard from the streets that

01:30:19.439 --> 01:30:22.500
Caption: some people are under the false

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.959
Caption: impression that PowerPoint is not the

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:28.859
Caption: greatest tool ever invented

01:30:24.959 --> 01:30:30.659
Caption: laugh I&#39;m shocked I mean PowerPoint has

01:30:28.859 --> 01:30:32.158
Caption: literally everything you could want from

01:30:30.659 --> 01:30:34.920
Caption: a programming language

01:30:32.159 --> 01:30:36.540
Caption: it has text

01:30:34.919 --> 01:30:38.279
Caption: it has

01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:41.540
Caption: shapes

01:30:38.279 --> 01:30:41.539
Caption: and most importantly

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:44.719
Caption: has animations

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:49.199
Caption: that&#39;s a totally random animation by the

01:30:47.879 --> 01:30:50.759
Caption: way the first time I&#39;m seeing it it&#39;s

01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:53.520
Caption: always fun

01:30:50.759 --> 01:30:55.198
Caption: you may laugh but the shapes and

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:57.000
Caption: animation is actually the key to what

01:30:55.199 --> 01:30:58.440
Caption: allow us to form a real machine learning

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.819
Caption: model with PowerPoint

01:30:58.439 --> 01:31:01.620
Caption: because they allow us to do something

01:30:59.819 --> 01:31:02.759
Caption: that developers take for granted every

01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:05.479
Caption: day

01:31:02.759 --> 01:31:05.479
Caption: management

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:10.199
Caption: in our model each slide will represent a

01:31:08.339 --> 01:31:12.000
Caption: particular move from either the player

01:31:10.199 --> 01:31:13.800
Caption: or the AI

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.139
Caption: we will then use these shapes and

01:31:13.799 --> 01:31:18.238
Caption: animations to manage that state to

01:31:16.139 --> 01:31:20.959
Caption: remember what they learn

01:31:18.238 --> 01:31:24.299
Caption: so our model will consist of

01:31:20.959 --> 01:31:27.319
Caption: 1830 states which is one thousand eight

01:31:24.299 --> 01:31:27.319
Caption: hundred and thirty slides

01:31:28.199 --> 01:31:31.260
Caption: each slide State consists of the

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:34.560
Caption: following

01:31:31.259 --> 01:31:35.939
Caption: simply the board which is the number of

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:38.939
Caption: naughts and crosses in their relative

01:31:35.939 --> 01:31:42.299
Caption: positions to each other in this case AI

01:31:38.939 --> 01:31:45.379
Caption: is cross and human player is not uh that

01:31:42.299 --> 01:31:45.379
Caption: just felt right I don&#39;t know

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:50.399
Caption: and also we also contain all of the

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:53.040
Caption: previous steps that got us to that state

01:31:50.399 --> 01:31:56.158
Caption: using one of my favorite PowerPoint

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:58.260
Caption: features Zoom transitions

01:31:56.159 --> 01:32:02.040
Caption: so this encodes all of the information

01:31:58.259 --> 01:32:04.559
Caption: that got us to the state that we were in

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:06.600
Caption: it allows us to pop back propagate

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:08.819
Caption: through each path and get to the slide

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:10.739
Caption: that led up to it

01:32:08.819 --> 01:32:13.020
Caption: so that&#39;s the state that&#39;s that&#39;s what

01:32:10.738 --> 01:32:15.718
Caption: we&#39;re trying to capture in a slide but

01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:16.979
Caption: how do you transition from one state to

01:32:15.719 --> 01:32:18.480
Caption: another

01:32:16.979 --> 01:32:21.238
Caption: well there are two different types of

01:32:18.479 --> 01:32:23.159
Caption: turns there&#39;s a player&#39;s turn and an

01:32:21.238 --> 01:32:25.319
Caption: ai&#39;s turn

01:32:23.159 --> 01:32:27.360
Caption: for the player a collection of shapes

01:32:25.319 --> 01:32:30.060
Caption: that place a naught and navigate to the

01:32:27.359 --> 01:32:31.138
Caption: relevant slide or on every single Blank

01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:33.359
Caption: Space

01:32:31.139 --> 01:32:35.760
Caption: they&#39;re invisible so they don&#39;t have any

01:32:33.359 --> 01:32:37.439
Caption: fill color or outline color but they do

01:32:35.759 --> 01:32:38.638
Caption: have a hyperlink to the slide that is

01:32:37.439 --> 01:32:41.459
Caption: relevant

01:32:38.639 --> 01:32:43.979
Caption: every click on an empty space navigates

01:32:41.459 --> 01:32:46.319
Caption: the user to a new slide where that knot

01:32:43.979 --> 01:32:48.479
Caption: is in the location that was clicked so

01:32:46.319 --> 01:32:50.579
Caption: for this slide there are eight invisible

01:32:48.479 --> 01:32:52.500
Caption: shapes but they are there and they

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:54.479
Caption: hyperlink to the relevant slide when a

01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:57.000
Caption: user clicks one

01:32:54.479 --> 01:32:58.560
Caption: we go to that slide and notice in the

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.719
Caption: top left hand corner we&#39;ve saved the

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:03.500
Caption: state of what it was previously by using

01:33:00.719 --> 01:33:03.500
Caption: the zoom transition

01:33:03.719 --> 01:33:10.560
Caption: so that&#39;s the player but what about the

01:33:06.479 --> 01:33:13.080
Caption: AI how do we get the AI to navigate

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:15.659
Caption: and this is where things get interesting

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:17.879
Caption: now to be sure a human player still

01:33:15.659 --> 01:33:19.939
Caption: clicks the AI we&#39;re not building a

01:33:17.879 --> 01:33:24.000
Caption: PowerPoint to control a mouse just yet

01:33:19.939 --> 01:33:25.919
Caption: although don&#39;t give me any ideas

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.139
Caption: for the AI there is also a collection of

01:33:25.919 --> 01:33:30.419
Caption: invisible shapes but these these ones

01:33:28.139 --> 01:33:32.400
Caption: blink at semi-random intervals the

01:33:30.419 --> 01:33:34.379
Caption: difference between this navigation and

01:33:32.399 --> 01:33:37.259
Caption: the previous navigation is that all the

01:33:34.379 --> 01:33:40.879
Caption: shapes are in the same place except only

01:33:37.259 --> 01:33:40.879
Caption: one is visible at a given time

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:47.219
Caption: when a user clicks on the button labeled

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:49.080
Caption: click to make AI move I have no ux

01:33:47.219 --> 01:33:51.540
Caption: designer but that&#39;s pretty

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:53.820
Caption: self-explanatory it instigates the

01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:55.620
Caption: animations of each shape lawet clicking

01:33:53.819 --> 01:33:57.779
Caption: so this is for demonstration in reality

01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:59.939
Caption: those shapes are invisible and they&#39;re

01:33:57.779 --> 01:34:03.859
Caption: clicking they&#39;re blinking a lot faster

01:33:59.939 --> 01:34:03.859
Caption: and there&#39;s a lot more of them

01:34:04.319 --> 01:34:07.939
Caption: so that&#39;s it

01:34:05.759 --> 01:34:12.238
Caption: our model consists of

01:34:07.939 --> 01:34:14.520
Caption: 1830 game stats 301 of those each have

01:34:12.238 --> 01:34:16.259
Caption: an AI making a random choice to proceed

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:18.659
Caption: to the next move

01:34:16.259 --> 01:34:20.579
Caption: now I say random choice

01:34:18.659 --> 01:34:22.080
Caption: currently we&#39;re set at a ground state

01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:23.520
Caption: for the model

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:27.959
Caption: and think of ground state as just

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:30.120
Caption: predicting 50 50 on a coin toss

01:34:27.959 --> 01:34:32.339
Caption: what we want to do is to change from

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:36.020
Caption: that ground state into a state that is

01:34:32.339 --> 01:34:36.020
Caption: optimized for playing Tic-Tac-Toe

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:39.659
Caption: how are we going to do that

01:34:37.979 --> 01:34:41.279
Caption: let&#39;s call back to what we learned just

01:34:39.659 --> 01:34:43.380
Caption: a few minutes ago

01:34:41.279 --> 01:34:45.658
Caption: we&#39;re going to use machine learning so

01:34:43.379 --> 01:34:48.899
Caption: we need to define a test

01:34:45.659 --> 01:34:52.500
Caption: a score and a way to punish or award the

01:34:48.899 --> 01:34:55.020
Caption: AI for making bad or good moves

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:56.879
Caption: so if we do this we can verify that what

01:34:55.020 --> 01:35:00.239
Caption: we&#39;ve indeed created is a machine

01:34:56.879 --> 01:35:03.379
Caption: learning model an AI for in a PowerPoint

01:35:00.238 --> 01:35:03.379
Caption: to play Tic-tac-toe

01:35:03.419 --> 01:35:08.100
Caption: first our test

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.959
Caption: due to the limited time of a lone man&#39;s

01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:12.959
Caption: calendar and the absurd amount of games

01:35:09.959 --> 01:35:16.020
Caption: of tic-tac-toe I said that this test is

01:35:12.959 --> 01:35:17.819
Caption: does the AI win in three moves the

01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:20.219
Caption: converse is true does the AI lose in

01:35:17.819 --> 01:35:23.279
Caption: three moves

01:35:20.219 --> 01:35:25.380
Caption: next our score

01:35:23.279 --> 01:35:27.059
Caption: now the number of winning games is not

01:35:25.379 --> 01:35:29.520
Caption: evenly distributed among the total

01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:31.199
Caption: number of games of tic-tac-toe what I

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:34.919
Caption: mean by that is there are far more games

01:35:31.199 --> 01:35:36.900
Caption: where neither the player nor the AI win

01:35:34.919 --> 01:35:40.799
Caption: so for this score we&#39;re going to

01:35:36.899 --> 01:35:43.620
Caption: consider three results pass the AI wins

01:35:40.799 --> 01:35:47.939
Caption: neutral neither the player nor the AI

01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:50.100
Caption: wins and three the AI losers

01:35:47.939 --> 01:35:51.718
Caption: passing represents the best possible

01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:53.040
Caption: score that we could get I want to

01:35:51.719 --> 01:35:56.159
Caption: encourage this as much as possible

01:35:53.040 --> 01:36:00.060
Caption: because it happens so few times

01:35:56.159 --> 01:36:01.080
Caption: um the failing is a bit more common but

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:02.639
Caption: we want to discourage this from

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:04.139
Caption: happening and neutral is pretty much the

01:36:02.639 --> 01:36:05.340
Caption: most common

01:36:04.139 --> 01:36:06.959
Caption: so

01:36:05.339 --> 01:36:08.879
Caption: this translates to how we&#39;re going to

01:36:06.959 --> 01:36:11.040
Caption: punish a reward

01:36:08.879 --> 01:36:13.439
Caption: when an AI passes and it wins in the

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:15.419
Caption: first three moves we want to give it an

01:36:13.439 --> 01:36:17.279
Caption: extra chance so that it will navigate to

01:36:15.419 --> 01:36:19.859
Caption: each slide that leads to a winning move

01:36:17.279 --> 01:36:21.779
Caption: that&#39;s signified by a plus three chance

01:36:19.859 --> 01:36:24.479
Caption: neutral nothing happens we don&#39;t want

01:36:21.779 --> 01:36:25.859
Caption: our AI to just lose all of its chances

01:36:24.479 --> 01:36:29.100
Caption: to navigate

01:36:25.859 --> 01:36:31.080
Caption: fail is we take away the chance to

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:34.820
Caption: navigate to the particular slide that

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:34.820
Caption: made it end up in a losing position

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:39.179
Caption: so

01:36:36.839 --> 01:36:42.000
Caption: how are we actually going to do this

01:36:39.179 --> 01:36:44.600
Caption: this is the fun bit this is the reason

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:48.238
Caption: why we had to have that absurd

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:49.919
Caption: arrangement of shapes blinking and all

01:36:48.238 --> 01:36:51.899
Caption: of them on the slide

01:36:49.919 --> 01:36:53.399
Caption: it&#39;s also why we have to stay save the

01:36:51.899 --> 01:36:57.379
Caption: previous state that we were in

01:36:53.399 --> 01:36:57.379
Caption: throughout the whole path of the game

01:36:58.799 --> 01:37:06.198
Caption: foreign so I said that each move in the

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:08.879
Caption: AI state has a

01:37:06.199 --> 01:37:10.620
Caption: absurd amount of blinking shapes now

01:37:08.879 --> 01:37:13.198
Caption: these shapes represent the probability

01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:15.179
Caption: of moving from one state to another

01:37:13.199 --> 01:37:17.940
Caption: in the ground state I&#39;ve initialized it

01:37:15.179 --> 01:37:20.100
Caption: with 10 shapes each to move to each

01:37:17.939 --> 01:37:20.879
Caption: available location than a I can move

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:24.419
Caption: into

01:37:20.879 --> 01:37:26.158
Caption: in this slide there are 70 7 places that

01:37:24.419 --> 01:37:28.979
Caption: the AI can move to they&#39;re the blank

01:37:26.159 --> 01:37:31.380
Caption: spaces because there&#39;s no symmetry here

01:37:28.979 --> 01:37:34.560
Caption: and because there&#39;s a initialized for

01:37:31.379 --> 01:37:36.540
Caption: the 10 shapes each to navigate to those

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:38.040
Caption: slides there are 70 randomly blinking

01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:40.500
Caption: shapes on this slide

01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:42.000
Caption: each one representing a chance to

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:44.540
Caption: navigate to the state that we&#39;re going

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.540
Caption: to move to

01:37:46.679 --> 01:37:50.580
Caption: so

01:37:47.819 --> 01:37:53.879
Caption: when an AI runs a test if the results

01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:56.520
Caption: were good that is the AI wins in the

01:37:53.879 --> 01:37:59.698
Caption: first three moves then we will track the

01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:02.219
Caption: moves it took to get to that state this

01:37:59.699 --> 01:38:04.500
Caption: represents the best possible play that

01:38:02.219 --> 01:38:06.600
Caption: an AI can make somewhere along the line

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:09.000
Caption: the player has made a mistake and the AI

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.800
Caption: has a chance to win and it does

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.819
Caption: we want to reward this as much as

01:38:10.799 --> 01:38:13.859
Caption: possible

01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:15.540
Caption: what I mean by that is we want to reward

01:38:13.859 --> 01:38:16.799
Caption: every state that came before it to

01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:18.060
Caption: appear again

01:38:16.799 --> 01:38:20.218
Caption: so

01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:23.580
Caption: we add more of those shapes that are

01:38:20.219 --> 01:38:24.600
Caption: randomly blinking the hyperlink to those

01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:26.520
Caption: slides

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:28.979
Caption: and we back propagate through every

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:32.219
Caption: state with that so it starts with no

01:38:28.979 --> 01:38:34.020
Caption: things no pieces on the board

01:38:32.219 --> 01:38:35.400
Caption: when we click the AR moves we want to

01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:38.839
Caption: encourage it then to move to the next

01:38:35.399 --> 01:38:38.839
Caption: state in which it will win

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:44.520
Caption: however

01:38:40.799 --> 01:38:46.079
Caption: let&#39;s say the AI makes a bad play

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:48.299
Caption: somewhere along the line it might have

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:49.979
Caption: even had a chance to win

01:38:48.299 --> 01:38:52.500
Caption: but then it doesn&#39;t it makes some sort

01:38:49.979 --> 01:38:55.020
Caption: of fatal error and leaves it open for

01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:56.399
Caption: the player to come in and attack

01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:58.919
Caption: we want to discourage this from

01:38:56.399 --> 01:39:02.580
Caption: happening if it&#39;s in a position where it

01:38:58.919 --> 01:39:04.259
Caption: can either win or Draw we don&#39;t want it

01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:06.359
Caption: then navigating to a slide which

01:39:04.259 --> 01:39:08.099
Caption: represents a state that a player can

01:39:06.359 --> 01:39:11.879
Caption: then win

01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:14.459
Caption: so every time we run a test and it loses

01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:16.859
Caption: we back propagate through every slide

01:39:14.459 --> 01:39:19.679
Caption: that we have and take away one of those

01:39:16.859 --> 01:39:20.939
Caption: shapes that navigates to the slide that

01:39:19.679 --> 01:39:22.860
Caption: ends up losing

01:39:20.939 --> 01:39:24.479
Caption: and that&#39;s for every single slide along

01:39:22.859 --> 01:39:26.580
Caption: the path

01:39:24.479 --> 01:39:28.620
Caption: this way when it&#39;s at a fork in the road

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:30.600
Caption: when it doesn&#39;t know where to put it

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:34.860
Caption: there is more chance that it will move

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:36.300
Caption: to a slide that wins or is neutral but

01:39:34.859 --> 01:39:39.419
Caption: there is less chance that it&#39;s going to

01:39:36.299 --> 01:39:41.819
Caption: navigate to a slide that loses

01:39:39.419 --> 01:39:44.399
Caption: if the test is neutral that is neither

01:39:41.819 --> 01:39:46.939
Caption: the player nor the AI win we simply just

01:39:44.399 --> 01:39:46.939
Caption: do nothing

01:39:48.419 --> 01:39:51.479
Caption: so

01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:53.100
Caption: this is an AI That&#39;s initialized with

01:39:51.479 --> 01:39:55.259
Caption: random choices but you&#39;ll be able to see

01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:56.939
Caption: as we go forward how it works

01:39:55.259 --> 01:39:59.099
Caption: the player is just put in the center and

01:39:56.939 --> 01:40:00.959
Caption: we click again to make the AI move

01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:03.120
Caption: in this case the randomly blinking

01:40:00.959 --> 01:40:04.799
Caption: shapes promoted us to navigate to a

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:06.899
Caption: slide there

01:40:04.799 --> 01:40:09.178
Caption: now a player made a mistake there the AI

01:40:06.899 --> 01:40:11.100
Caption: has a chance to win here an optimized

01:40:09.179 --> 01:40:12.540
Caption: model will put it on the top

01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:15.540
Caption: but because there&#39;s an equal chance

01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:17.580
Caption: currently for the AI to click onto the

01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:19.859
Caption: navigate to the wrong slide it doesn&#39;t

01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:21.600
Caption: it makes a mistake we&#39;re going to

01:40:19.859 --> 01:40:23.580
Caption: discourage this from happening by

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.899
Caption: navigating back through every slide and

01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:26.760
Caption: taking away one of those randomly

01:40:24.899 --> 01:40:28.500
Caption: blinking shapes so that if it&#39;s ever in

01:40:26.759 --> 01:40:32.218
Caption: the same position again it has less

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:34.020
Caption: chance to navigate to that losing slide

01:40:32.219 --> 01:40:35.580
Caption: and then

01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:37.260
Caption: we do it again

01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:38.459
Caption: the AI will make a move in the top left

01:40:37.259 --> 01:40:40.879
Caption: hand corner and the player will make

01:40:38.459 --> 01:40:40.879
Caption: another move

01:40:40.979 --> 01:40:45.299
Caption: this time the a made a different move

01:40:42.479 --> 01:40:46.919
Caption: it&#39;s setting itself up right to win but

01:40:45.299 --> 01:40:48.839
Caption: a player blocks it

01:40:46.919 --> 01:40:51.678
Caption: player now has a chance to win so an

01:40:48.839 --> 01:40:54.718
Caption: optimized AI with all the navigation

01:40:51.679 --> 01:40:56.580
Caption: shapes configured correctly we try and

01:40:54.719 --> 01:40:59.340
Caption: put it in the bottom but again it makes

01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:02.040
Caption: a mistake so moving forward we

01:40:59.339 --> 01:41:04.619
Caption: discourage that by taking away every

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:06.780
Caption: shape that leads to this state

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:12.260
Caption: from the PowerPoint deck

01:41:06.779 --> 01:41:12.259
Caption: and this is a long ruling process

01:41:14.339 --> 01:41:18.178
Caption: there is a question that I&#39;m sure a lot

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.479
Caption: of you have been asking throughout all

01:41:18.179 --> 01:41:20.479
Caption: of this

01:41:28.379 --> 01:41:31.439
Caption: how many games

01:41:30.659 --> 01:41:33.840
Caption: um

01:41:31.439 --> 01:41:35.759
Caption: to be sure I mean it&#39;s great to say what

01:41:33.839 --> 01:41:38.218
Caption: machine learning is not maybe break the

01:41:35.759 --> 01:41:39.839
Caption: stigma how it can be used but why does

01:41:38.219 --> 01:41:41.280
Caption: the fundamentals of the understanding

01:41:39.839 --> 01:41:43.379
Caption: machine learning matter

01:41:41.279 --> 01:41:45.479
Caption: besides the fun of knowledge for

01:41:43.379 --> 01:41:47.520
Caption: knowledge&#39;s sake why did I go through

01:41:45.479 --> 01:41:50.339
Caption: this whole process of constructing a way

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:53.339
Caption: to train a PowerPoint to go through a

01:41:50.339 --> 01:41:55.919
Caption: machine learning algorithm

01:41:53.339 --> 01:41:57.540
Caption: what I hope is clear by now is the

01:41:55.919 --> 01:41:59.520
Caption: distinction between traditional control

01:41:57.540 --> 01:42:02.639
Caption: logic and the Machine learning approach

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:05.279
Caption: and that&#39;s all it is an approach

01:42:02.639 --> 01:42:07.979
Caption: the difference suggests a fundamental

01:42:05.279 --> 01:42:10.618
Caption: change in how we conduct analysis build

01:42:07.979 --> 01:42:12.659
Caption: Automation and program

01:42:10.619 --> 01:42:15.119
Caption: in the other models we saw predicting a

01:42:12.659 --> 01:42:16.560
Caption: digit based on its Darkness or randomly

01:42:15.119 --> 01:42:20.880
Caption: guessing are examples of this

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:23.159
Caption: traditional logic if this then that

01:42:20.879 --> 01:42:25.379
Caption: however machine learning if nothing else

01:42:23.159 --> 01:42:27.179
Caption: is a tool that allows us to move past

01:42:25.379 --> 01:42:29.459
Caption: this constrained test

01:42:27.179 --> 01:42:31.199
Caption: it&#39;s not possible to know every then

01:42:29.459 --> 01:42:35.299
Caption: this and it&#39;s certainly too time

01:42:31.199 --> 01:42:35.300
Caption: consuming to label every then that

01:42:35.639 --> 01:42:39.780
Caption: machine learning allows us to tackle

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:41.939
Caption: problems that we couldn&#39;t possibly know

01:42:39.779 --> 01:42:43.559
Caption: how to tackle

01:42:41.939 --> 01:42:46.500
Caption: machine learning is not just predicting

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:49.020
Caption: digits or analyzing text sentiment but

01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:51.659
Caption: any process in which we can test score

01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:53.580
Caption: and provide feedback

01:42:51.659 --> 01:42:56.520
Caption: all of the advancements in machine

01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:59.280
Caption: learning the maths the the distributed

01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:02.939
Caption: compute are just ways that we can extend

01:42:59.279 --> 01:43:07.459
Caption: this process of creating fancy tests

01:43:02.939 --> 01:43:07.459
Caption: scoring it and then running it again

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:12.899
Caption: in cases like I said the cross entropy

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:14.759
Caption: loss which sounds pretty fancy but all

01:43:12.899 --> 01:43:16.619
Caption: it is is a way of getting our list of

01:43:14.759 --> 01:43:19.138
Caption: numbers that we predicted and the list

01:43:16.619 --> 01:43:21.479
Caption: of numbers that we expected and doing a

01:43:19.139 --> 01:43:23.340
Caption: calculating a score that is kind of easy

01:43:21.479 --> 01:43:25.979
Caption: to comprehend

01:43:23.339 --> 01:43:28.259
Caption: sometimes it&#39;s not as easy so the

01:43:25.979 --> 01:43:29.759
Caption: researchers have to go above and beyond

01:43:28.259 --> 01:43:31.138
Caption: to try and think about what they&#39;re even

01:43:29.759 --> 01:43:33.359
Caption: trying to test

01:43:31.139 --> 01:43:36.540
Caption: an example like the audio transcription

01:43:33.359 --> 01:43:37.859
Caption: paper that we saw where they were faced

01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:40.439
Caption: with a problem that isn&#39;t immediately

01:43:37.859 --> 01:43:43.020
Caption: obvious what we do so they rather than

01:43:40.439 --> 01:43:45.359
Caption: diving into let&#39;s just pump up with more

01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:47.219
Caption: compute power it was let&#39;s take a step

01:43:45.359 --> 01:43:50.040
Caption: back and what is it that we&#39;re even

01:43:47.219 --> 01:43:52.460
Caption: trying to test it&#39;s the other Dynamics

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:52.459
Caption: correct

01:43:52.619 --> 01:43:56.399
Caption: in a PowerPoint example

01:43:54.899 --> 01:43:59.339
Caption: it&#39;s not

01:43:56.399 --> 01:44:00.839
Caption: how can we somehow make some code in

01:43:59.339 --> 01:44:02.158
Caption: PowerPoint although PowerPoint is true

01:44:00.839 --> 01:44:03.419
Caption: and complete

01:44:02.159 --> 01:44:06.300
Caption: um

01:44:03.419 --> 01:44:08.879
Caption: it&#39;s a way of analyzing what we have to

01:44:06.299 --> 01:44:11.819
Caption: work with shapes slides and animations

01:44:08.879 --> 01:44:14.520
Caption: and how can we use those to do the

01:44:11.819 --> 01:44:17.698
Caption: fundamental components of testing

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:20.639
Caption: scoring and providing feedback

01:44:17.699 --> 01:44:22.739
Caption: by adding and subtracting shapes the

01:44:20.639 --> 01:44:25.860
Caption: animation allows us to navigate through

01:44:22.738 --> 01:44:27.839
Caption: States but it simply taking away and

01:44:25.859 --> 01:44:30.319
Caption: adding shapes that allows us to provide

01:44:27.839 --> 01:44:30.319
Caption: feedback

01:44:31.439 --> 01:44:35.459
Caption: in the end machine learning Taps into

01:44:33.719 --> 01:44:37.679
Caption: something that we take for granted but

01:44:35.459 --> 01:44:42.379
Caption: applies it in a programmatic way

01:44:37.679 --> 01:44:42.380
Caption: it&#39;s our ability to learn before knowing

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.779
Caption: so thank you

01:44:50.219 --> 01:44:56.820
Caption: on the slides here I have uh some of the

01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:59.179
Caption: resources that I did mention neural

01:44:56.819 --> 01:45:01.560
Caption: networks in deep learning is the book

01:44:59.179 --> 01:45:02.639
Caption: All Around the fundamentals of neural

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:05.280
Caption: networks

01:45:02.639 --> 01:45:07.320
Caption: started using the terms AI Machining a

01:45:05.279 --> 01:45:08.399
Caption: little bit interchangeably but as I

01:45:07.319 --> 01:45:10.379
Caption: mentioned way at the beginning machine

01:45:08.399 --> 01:45:12.359
Caption: learning is just one Avenue that allows

01:45:10.379 --> 01:45:14.419
Caption: us to get through Ai and it&#39;s one of the

01:45:12.359 --> 01:45:17.218
Caption: most popular and it&#39;s certainly useful

01:45:14.419 --> 01:45:19.619
Caption: neural networks is another subset of

01:45:17.219 --> 01:45:21.600
Caption: machine learning it&#39;s a particular of

01:45:19.619 --> 01:45:23.100
Caption: interest of mine but if anyone&#39;s

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:24.600
Caption: interested in learning more I&#39;d

01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:26.879
Caption: recommend that book

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:28.260
Caption: on set and Frames dual objective pianos

01:45:26.879 --> 01:45:31.560
Caption: show inscription is the paper that I

01:45:28.259 --> 01:45:33.178
Caption: maybe flippantly was reviewing I want to

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:34.379
Caption: be clear that the Google lab team and

01:45:33.179 --> 01:45:36.780
Caption: everyone that worked on that the

01:45:34.379 --> 01:45:38.399
Caption: incredible work but it does provide a

01:45:36.779 --> 01:45:40.979
Caption: good example of how in the real world

01:45:38.399 --> 01:45:43.319
Caption: sometimes how we test and how we score

01:45:40.979 --> 01:45:45.659
Caption: isn&#39;t immediately obvious

01:45:43.319 --> 01:45:47.698
Caption: Menace the pile of matchboxes which can

01:45:45.659 --> 01:45:50.580
Caption: learn if you want to look at this but

01:45:47.699 --> 01:45:52.320
Caption: done in matchboxes have a go at that but

01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:53.820
Caption: I mean they cheated right they had a

01:45:52.319 --> 01:45:55.500
Caption: whole bunch of people working um this

01:45:53.819 --> 01:45:57.839
Caption: was just me in a PowerPoint

01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:59.479
Caption: which is a lot sadder than now I&#39;m

01:45:57.839 --> 01:46:01.618
Caption: saying it out loud

01:45:59.479 --> 01:46:03.359
Caption: and lastly great impractical ideas

01:46:01.619 --> 01:46:05.880
Caption: computer science PowerPoint programming

01:46:03.359 --> 01:46:07.319
Caption: is a hoot it&#39;s a long one but if you

01:46:05.879 --> 01:46:10.399
Caption: want to see a turing machine in

01:46:07.319 --> 01:46:12.959
Caption: PowerPoint there&#39;s your go

01:46:10.399 --> 01:46:14.718
Caption: if you&#39;re interested in a follow-up you

01:46:12.959 --> 01:46:16.919
Caption: can add me on Twitter LinkedIn you can

01:46:14.719 --> 01:46:17.760
Caption: go to the blog site that I occasionally

01:46:16.919 --> 01:46:20.339
Caption: write

01:46:17.759 --> 01:46:22.079
Caption: um I do have a working version of this

01:46:20.339 --> 01:46:24.118
Caption: PowerPoint AI as you saw in the video

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:26.339
Caption: it&#39;s not yet optimized for playing

01:46:24.119 --> 01:46:28.860
Caption: Tic-Tac-Toe perfectly because it takes

01:46:26.339 --> 01:46:31.439
Caption: many many iterations of running the test

01:46:28.859 --> 01:46:33.238
Caption: adding and subtracting the shapes and my

01:46:31.439 --> 01:46:36.178
Caption: friends didn&#39;t find that interesting on

01:46:33.238 --> 01:46:37.198
Caption: a Saturday night so um yeah please reach

01:46:36.179 --> 01:46:41.000
Caption: out to me if you&#39;re interested in

01:46:37.199 --> 01:46:41.000
Caption: versing a PowerPoint in tic-tac-toe

01:46:41.219 --> 01:46:44.760
Caption: I lastly want to thank all of the

01:46:42.719 --> 01:46:47.400
Caption: sponsors for DDD they&#39;re the people who

01:46:44.759 --> 01:46:49.319
Caption: allow us me to stand up here and talk

01:46:47.399 --> 01:46:53.279
Caption: about something that I have no right to

01:46:49.319 --> 01:46:54.959
Caption: be uh talking about a PowerPoint Ai and

01:46:53.279 --> 01:46:57.359
Caption: also thank you to all the volunteers who

01:46:54.959 --> 01:46:58.379
Caption: work up very early today to get this all

01:46:57.359 --> 01:47:01.020
Caption: working

01:46:58.379 --> 01:47:05.540
Caption: thank you

01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:05.540
Caption: I think we have time for some questions

01:47:09.779 --> 01:47:15.259
Caption: yeah

01:47:11.759 --> 01:47:15.259
Caption: I think we&#39;ve got a question there yeah

01:47:15.899 --> 01:47:20.100
Caption: oh thanks so you said machine learning

01:47:18.479 --> 01:47:23.580
Caption: is one of the ways to do AI what are the

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:25.320
Caption: ways yeah AI is like about as broad as

01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:27.119
Caption: term as you can get some people consider

01:47:25.319 --> 01:47:28.979
Caption: things like statistical models and

01:47:27.119 --> 01:47:31.080
Caption: everything to be part of AI so that&#39;s

01:47:28.979 --> 01:47:32.339
Caption: not something that uses an iterative

01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:33.780
Caption: approach

01:47:32.339 --> 01:47:36.658
Caption: um but you know things like probability

01:47:33.779 --> 01:47:38.158
Caption: tests and t-tests other people uh

01:47:36.659 --> 01:47:40.199
Caption: natural language processing is a really

01:47:38.159 --> 01:47:42.360
Caption: interesting example of AI that isn&#39;t

01:47:40.199 --> 01:47:44.340
Caption: machine learning because there&#39;s a whole

01:47:42.359 --> 01:47:46.919
Caption: bunch of still maths linear algebra and

01:47:44.339 --> 01:47:49.618
Caption: stuff but they don&#39;t do the iterative

01:47:46.919 --> 01:47:51.238
Caption: approach they just do like Vector

01:47:49.619 --> 01:47:52.500
Caption: multiplication and stuff like that

01:47:51.238 --> 01:47:55.759
Caption: that&#39;s simplifying it a lot but there

01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:55.759
Caption: are yeah those are some of the examples

01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:58.939
Caption: next question

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:07.619
Caption: um I was pretty impressed with what

01:48:06.238 --> 01:48:11.698
Caption: we&#39;ve seen today but I just wanted to

01:48:07.619 --> 01:48:13.679
Caption: ask what&#39;s next next oh well I mean go

01:48:11.699 --> 01:48:15.719
Caption: is one of the most complicated games you

01:48:13.679 --> 01:48:16.979
Caption: can play Maybe

01:48:15.719 --> 01:48:18.659
Caption: no

01:48:16.979 --> 01:48:20.520
Caption: um I don&#39;t know I mean to be honest this

01:48:18.659 --> 01:48:22.500
Caption: is just a fun example maybe I&#39;ve spent

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:24.319
Caption: too much time on it but it was more of

01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:26.699
Caption: an exploration into

01:48:24.319 --> 01:48:29.339
Caption: how fundamental machine learning

01:48:26.699 --> 01:48:31.400
Caption: actually is I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d do

01:48:29.339 --> 01:48:34.738
Caption: something like this again

01:48:31.399 --> 01:48:37.500
Caption: yeah unless you sat me down in a torture

01:48:34.738 --> 01:48:40.738
Caption: room but um I can&#39;t stress enough how

01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:42.419
Caption: many hours it was to form that board

01:48:40.738 --> 01:48:43.500
Caption: um but yeah I&#39;m always Keen in

01:48:42.419 --> 01:48:46.139
Caption: investigating these sort of weird

01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:52.020
Caption: approaches so

01:48:46.139 --> 01:48:54.800
Caption: anyone else lucky last question guys

01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:54.799
Caption: anybody

01:48:56.939 --> 01:49:02.040
Caption: wonderful oh oh we&#39;ve got another one

01:48:59.939 --> 01:49:04.139
Caption: you know I&#39;ll talk about this for hours

01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:05.879
Caption: oh yeah um yeah I&#39;ll ask another

01:49:04.139 --> 01:49:08.340
Caption: question so I was just curious with the

01:49:05.879 --> 01:49:10.080
Caption: um PowerPoints I never thought of it but

01:49:08.339 --> 01:49:11.399
Caption: um did you so there&#39;s no code you just

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:13.159
Caption: literally have a PowerPoint that just

01:49:11.399 --> 01:49:16.520
Caption: click through it yeah yeah yeah

01:49:13.159 --> 01:49:20.209
Caption: someone was manually doing the um like

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:24.479
Caption: punishments and rewards yeah wow okay

01:49:20.209 --> 01:49:26.639
Caption: [Laughter]

01:49:24.479 --> 01:49:29.399
Caption: like I said there was macros involved to

01:49:26.639 --> 01:49:33.840
Caption: like insert the slides um like I&#39;m not

01:49:29.399 --> 01:49:36.959
Caption: gonna copy and paste one 1830 slides

01:49:33.839 --> 01:49:38.158
Caption: um but yeah those those macros weren&#39;t

01:49:36.959 --> 01:49:39.359
Caption: used for the actual training of it

01:49:38.159 --> 01:49:40.800
Caption: because that kind of defeats the purpose

01:49:39.359 --> 01:49:43.259
Caption: this would be

01:49:40.799 --> 01:49:44.879
Caption: easy to do it in VBA or something like

01:49:43.259 --> 01:49:46.319
Caption: that but it wouldn&#39;t it defeat the

01:49:44.879 --> 01:49:48.060
Caption: purpose of the whole exercise I think

01:49:46.319 --> 01:49:50.959
Caption: personally I mean maybe I&#39;m just

01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:50.959
Caption: sadistic but yeah

01:49:51.238 --> 01:49:53.779
Caption: thank you so

01:49:58.619 --> 01:50:01.459

01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:56.100
Caption: is a disaster

01:54:53.939 --> 01:54:58.459

01:55:01.259 --> 01:55:06.059

Caption: to lose one single customer I hear you

01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:10.679

01:55:10.679 --> 01:55:14.459

01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:15.719

01:55:15.719 --> 01:55:18.900

Caption: like to use oh Sarah can do that yeah

01:55:22.319 --> 01:55:25.678
Caption: but it needs to be secure we can&#39;t have

01:55:23.939 --> 01:55:27.060
Caption: our app compromised by breaches not a

01:55:25.679 --> 01:55:28.380
Caption: problem and it needs to scale if we get

01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:30.359

01:55:28.379 --> 01:55:32.839

Caption: involved with running conferences before

02:01:56.879 --> 02:02:01.259
Caption: but without sponsors then they&#39;re

02:01:58.919 --> 02:02:04.319
Caption: impossible and like to get a conference

02:02:01.259 --> 02:02:06.779
Caption: like this for 60 bucks is just like it&#39;s

02:02:04.319 --> 02:02:10.158

Caption: going over today what can go wrong which

02:02:15.779 --> 02:02:21.000
Caption: may lead to financial loss what we can

02:02:18.599 --> 02:02:22.679
Caption: do to reduce the risk and a short wrap

Caption: wrong

02:03:47.879 --> 02:03:51.839
Caption: so

02:03:49.679 --> 02:03:55.199
Caption: I was trying to put the talk together

02:03:51.839 --> 02:03:57.238
Caption: I&#39;ve got swen uh who&#39;s our you know my

02:03:55.199 --> 02:03:59.159

Caption: talk at conferences so what&#39;s a nice

02:03:59.159 --> 02:04:04.439
Caption: topical generic subject we can speak

02:04:01.919 --> 02:04:06.060
Caption: about in order to educate and you know

02:04:04.439 --> 02:04:07.738
Caption: not be too deep and intimidating I&#39;m

02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:10.859
Caption: like well let&#39;s talk about Sim swapping

02:04:07.738 --> 02:04:12.718
Caption: has anyone heard of sim swapping

02:04:10.859 --> 02:04:14.819
Caption: manual

02:04:12.719 --> 02:04:16.320
Caption: all right so just imagine you&#39;re holding

02:04:14.819 --> 02:04:18.118
Caption: your phone scrolling through Tick Tock

02:04:16.319 --> 02:04:19.678
Caption: and sitting there waiting for the bus or

02:04:18.119 --> 02:04:21.719
Caption: whatever and then all of a sudden your

02:04:19.679 --> 02:04:23.159
Caption: data stops and then you look at the top

02:04:21.719 --> 02:04:25.980
Caption: and instead of it saying Optus or

02:04:23.159 --> 02:04:28.139
Caption: Telstra or Vodafone it says SOS

02:04:25.979 --> 02:04:30.060
Caption: that&#39;s the experience you&#39;ll receive

02:04:28.139 --> 02:04:32.459
Caption: when you&#39;ve been Sim swapped essentially

02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:34.439
Caption: what a Sim swap is is someone

02:04:32.459 --> 02:04:36.419
Caption: fraudulently pretends to be you and

02:04:34.439 --> 02:04:39.959
Caption: steals your phone number

02:04:36.419 --> 02:04:41.639
Caption: all right so why do they do that most

02:04:39.959 --> 02:04:43.259
Caption: banks are pretty sucky with their

02:04:41.639 --> 02:04:45.239
Caption: security sorry Banks and specially

02:04:43.259 --> 02:04:47.098
Caption: Bankwest being a sponsor but like you

02:04:45.238 --> 02:04:50.039
Caption: know your MFA

02:04:47.099 --> 02:04:52.619
Caption: normally is SMS with a bank so if you

02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:54.959
Caption: own the phone number then they can

02:04:52.619 --> 02:04:57.239
Caption: pretty much say that they&#39;re you verify

02:04:54.959 --> 02:04:58.020
Caption: money transfers

02:04:57.238 --> 02:05:00.178
Caption: um

02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:02.279
Caption: the other reason why Sim swaps can be

02:05:00.179 --> 02:05:04.500
Caption: somewhat effective is especially on a

02:05:02.279 --> 02:05:07.079
Caption: prepaid service you don&#39;t need a lot of

02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:09.179
Caption: information to do a Sim swap

02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:11.399
Caption: so I thought I&#39;d do a Sim swap on myself

02:05:09.179 --> 02:05:12.900
Caption: I did it with a prepaid that I

02:05:11.399 --> 02:05:15.119
Caption: registered and then I got another

02:05:12.899 --> 02:05:19.859
Caption: prepaid sim I&#39;m not going to do it with

02:05:15.119 --> 02:05:21.840
Caption: my details but um basically you can see

02:05:19.859 --> 02:05:24.479
Caption: here this is the number

02:05:21.839 --> 02:05:27.178
Caption: and I needed to know these two things

02:05:24.479 --> 02:05:30.000
Caption: right so these can be found reasonably

02:05:27.179 --> 02:05:31.380
Caption: easy like if a hacker was doing this

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:33.299
Caption: you&#39;d assume that they&#39;ve already

02:05:31.379 --> 02:05:35.459
Caption: compromised you in some way probably

02:05:33.299 --> 02:05:39.000
Caption: I&#39;ve got your email box there&#39;s like a

02:05:35.459 --> 02:05:40.679
Caption: statistic like 98.9 of gmails do not

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:43.379
Caption: have two-factor authentication turned on

02:05:40.679 --> 02:05:45.840
Caption: them right and

02:05:43.379 --> 02:05:48.839
Caption: there&#39;s an odds odds are a lot of people

02:05:45.839 --> 02:05:50.698
Caption: are quite sucky with their passwords and

02:05:48.839 --> 02:05:53.098
Caption: reuse passwords and we&#39;ll talk about

02:05:50.699 --> 02:05:54.300
Caption: that in a little while but um so to do a

02:05:53.099 --> 02:05:57.300
Caption: Sim swap you need to know a phone number

02:05:54.299 --> 02:06:00.598
Caption: and you need to know the provider

02:05:57.299 --> 02:06:02.540
Caption: and then all you need to do is have an

02:06:00.599 --> 02:06:04.979
Caption: ID type so for

02:06:02.540 --> 02:06:06.719
Caption: circles.life you need to have either a

02:06:04.979 --> 02:06:08.580
Caption: driver&#39;s license a Medicare card or a

02:06:06.719 --> 02:06:10.380
Caption: passport number but they don&#39;t actually

02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:11.639
Caption: verify that you just need to know the

02:06:10.379 --> 02:06:15.658
Caption: number

02:06:11.639 --> 02:06:17.340
Caption: right so there&#39;s my license number

02:06:15.659 --> 02:06:19.139
Caption: but you know because it&#39;s so easy I&#39;m

02:06:17.339 --> 02:06:21.178
Caption: not going to give it to you there&#39;s my

02:06:19.139 --> 02:06:23.219
Caption: first name my middle name shown on my

02:06:21.179 --> 02:06:26.099
Caption: license my last name

02:06:23.219 --> 02:06:27.599
Caption: then you need the date of birth

02:06:26.099 --> 02:06:28.979
Caption: but if you&#39;ve got the license number

02:06:27.599 --> 02:06:31.500
Caption: you&#39;ve probably got the date of birth

02:06:28.979 --> 02:06:32.939
Caption: right like an attacker is going to be

02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:34.619
Caption: prepared they&#39;re not going to be like

02:06:32.939 --> 02:06:37.379
Caption: some schmuck like me trying to simulate

02:06:34.619 --> 02:06:39.000
Caption: it for your benefit so you know and you

02:06:37.379 --> 02:06:42.299
Caption: need the email but once you&#39;ve got that

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:44.099
Caption: like to me that&#39;s not a very high bar if

02:06:42.299 --> 02:06:45.178
Caption: you&#39;re able to compromise someone&#39;s

02:06:44.099 --> 02:06:49.080
Caption: email

02:06:45.179 --> 02:06:50.940
Caption: and then you verify it with a code sent

02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:52.500
Caption: to the email it&#39;s blurrier than I

02:06:50.939 --> 02:06:55.139
Caption: thought it would be sorry

02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:57.679
Caption: um but then that initiates the um the

02:06:55.139 --> 02:06:57.679
Caption: Sim swap

02:06:58.259 --> 02:07:03.658
Caption: so that was the text I got

02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:06.479
Caption: um that was the the validation of the ID

02:07:03.659 --> 02:07:08.340
Caption: but you saw that was all of the

02:07:06.479 --> 02:07:10.020
Caption: information I gave them so you don&#39;t

02:07:08.339 --> 02:07:11.939
Caption: need the physical ID you just need the

02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:13.439
Caption: information and I know that like in the

02:07:11.939 --> 02:07:14.819
Caption: past when I&#39;ve traveled say overseas

02:07:13.439 --> 02:07:16.979
Caption: I&#39;ve um

02:07:14.819 --> 02:07:19.439
Caption: taken a scan of important documents just

02:07:16.979 --> 02:07:21.659
Caption: so I don&#39;t lose it if in case you know I

02:07:19.439 --> 02:07:24.178
Caption: lose it I can prove who I am so I

02:07:21.659 --> 02:07:25.860
Caption: haven&#39;t deleted that I don&#39;t know how

02:07:24.179 --> 02:07:28.320
Caption: long people have had the same mailbox

02:07:25.859 --> 02:07:30.060
Caption: but I&#39;ve had some for 15 years and

02:07:28.319 --> 02:07:33.060
Caption: that&#39;s got a lot of pii in it and if I

02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:35.599
Caption: lost access then I&#39;ll lose it

02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:35.599
Caption: so

02:07:36.419 --> 02:07:41.639
Caption: so you may ask why you should care about

02:07:39.419 --> 02:07:45.060
Caption: this and what does all of this have to

02:07:41.639 --> 02:07:47.099
Caption: do with you as a consumer well as

02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:48.379
Caption: consumers we need to protect ourselves

02:07:47.099 --> 02:07:50.280
Caption: against

02:07:48.379 --> 02:07:52.678
Caption: hackers

02:07:50.279 --> 02:07:54.658
Caption: what that was meant to be humorous but

02:07:52.679 --> 02:07:57.179
Caption: never mind

02:07:54.659 --> 02:07:59.520
Caption: so next up we are going to talk about

02:07:57.179 --> 02:08:01.860
Caption: potential attack vectors which may lead

02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:04.080
Caption: to account compromise

02:08:01.859 --> 02:08:06.658
Caption: there are many websites that have been

02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:08.760
Caption: compromised tryhand Publishers a site

02:08:06.659 --> 02:08:10.920
Caption: you can use to see which one of your

02:08:08.759 --> 02:08:13.678
Caption: accounts have been compromised if they

02:08:10.919 --> 02:08:15.658
Caption: are so this is a very popular website

02:08:13.679 --> 02:08:18.179
Caption: called have I been pawned we actually

02:08:15.659 --> 02:08:21.119
Caption: use this at the Cohen University for our

02:08:18.179 --> 02:08:23.280
Caption: cyber security workshops as well and

02:08:21.119 --> 02:08:25.260
Caption: just simply key in your sorry just

02:08:23.279 --> 02:08:27.238
Caption: simply key in your email address or your

02:08:25.259 --> 02:08:29.039
Caption: phone number and this website tells you

02:08:27.238 --> 02:08:31.500
Caption: whether or not it has been compromised

02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:33.780
Caption: and how many instances that has happened

02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:35.459
Caption: so this website keeps a database of

02:08:33.779 --> 02:08:37.618
Caption: accounts with their credentials

02:08:35.459 --> 02:08:38.359
Caption: compromised as you can see here there

02:08:37.619 --> 02:08:42.000
Caption: are

02:08:38.359 --> 02:08:43.500
Caption: 626 websites hacked 11 billion accounts

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.859
Caption: breached and

02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:50.520
Caption: I don&#39;t know what those two are but yeah

02:08:46.859 --> 02:08:52.979
Caption: password reuse so even if you secure the

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:55.439
Caption: data well the user might just give it

02:08:52.979 --> 02:08:58.379
Caption: away with poor password hygiene

02:08:55.439 --> 02:09:00.060
Caption: so can we have a show of hands of how

02:08:58.379 --> 02:09:03.439
Caption: many people here we use the same

02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:06.179
Caption: password across multiple sites

02:09:03.439 --> 02:09:08.339
Caption: ah ah

02:09:06.179 --> 02:09:11.940
Caption: wait I want to know who those are I want

02:09:08.339 --> 02:09:14.279
Caption: to hack you oh wait sorry about that uh

02:09:11.939 --> 02:09:16.859
Caption: so anyway

02:09:14.279 --> 02:09:19.799
Caption: according to this website dataprod.net

02:09:16.859 --> 02:09:22.319
Caption: on average the same password is used to

02:09:19.799 --> 02:09:25.020
Caption: access five different accounts which

02:09:22.319 --> 02:09:26.459
Caption: like I said I wanted to hack you guys so

02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:28.260
Caption: if you could just write down your

02:09:26.459 --> 02:09:31.020
Caption: credentials and put it over here I would

02:09:28.259 --> 02:09:33.359
Caption: very much appreciate that

02:09:31.020 --> 02:09:35.760
Caption: I&#39;m sure this has been enforced in a lot

02:09:33.359 --> 02:09:37.859
Caption: of account logins especially in

02:09:35.759 --> 02:09:41.399
Caption: organizations multi-factor

02:09:37.859 --> 02:09:44.158
Caption: authentication or MFA when you develop

02:09:41.399 --> 02:09:46.198
Caption: an application encourage or enforce your

02:09:44.159 --> 02:09:47.520
Caption: users to register for multi-factor

02:09:46.199 --> 02:09:49.560
Caption: Authentication

02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:52.319
Caption: ideally you do not build your own

02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:54.719
Caption: authentication process but leverage an

02:09:52.319 --> 02:09:57.479
Caption: authentication provider that manages the

02:09:54.719 --> 02:09:59.340
Caption: user accounts securely and provides a

02:09:57.479 --> 02:10:01.859
Caption: secure authentication process with

02:09:59.339 --> 02:10:04.678
Caption: two-factor Authentication

02:10:01.859 --> 02:10:06.959
Caption: hyperscalers all allow for it for

02:10:04.679 --> 02:10:09.840
Caption: example Azure and other dedicated

02:10:06.959 --> 02:10:12.119
Caption: providers providers for authentication

02:10:09.839 --> 02:10:15.118
Caption: like r0 who has their Booth right

02:10:12.119 --> 02:10:16.919
Caption: outside or Microsoft authenticator and

02:10:15.119 --> 02:10:19.800
Caption: so on

02:10:16.919 --> 02:10:21.419
Caption: just don&#39;t use SMS for MFA how because

02:10:19.799 --> 02:10:23.698
Caption: we&#39;ve already proven that since I&#39;ve

02:10:21.419 --> 02:10:26.639
Caption: been kind of a sucky method right

02:10:23.699 --> 02:10:28.080
Caption: so uh dependency hell uh when you write

02:10:26.639 --> 02:10:30.719
Caption: software you don&#39;t write everything from

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:33.119
Caption: Star we just said don&#39;t use don&#39;t roll

02:10:30.719 --> 02:10:35.400
Caption: your own authentication like that&#39;s a a

02:10:33.119 --> 02:10:38.580
Caption: rule that people hopefully all follow

02:10:35.399 --> 02:10:40.439
Caption: but at the same time you know if you&#39;ve

02:10:38.580 --> 02:10:41.820
Caption: got to log files you don&#39;t want to write

02:10:40.439 --> 02:10:43.439
Caption: your own logging solution there&#39;s

02:10:41.819 --> 02:10:45.118
Caption: logging Solutions out there there&#39;s this

02:10:43.439 --> 02:10:46.198
Caption: awesome one called log4j people may have

02:10:45.119 --> 02:10:48.119
Caption: heard of it

02:10:46.199 --> 02:10:50.820
Caption: um then there&#39;s you know maybe you want

02:10:48.119 --> 02:10:53.040
Caption: to upload files to a website or a web

02:10:50.819 --> 02:10:55.738
Caption: server collect documents you use a

02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:57.419
Caption: library or you use a dependency but the

02:10:55.738 --> 02:10:59.218
Caption: problem is

02:10:57.419 --> 02:11:01.619
Caption: when you use it

02:10:59.219 --> 02:11:04.380
Caption: you don&#39;t know what&#39;s in that Library it

02:11:01.619 --> 02:11:07.080
Caption: can be like a real mess right so this is

02:11:04.379 --> 02:11:08.819
Caption: an uh a comic

02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:11.820
Caption: um if you go find it you&#39;ll see like

02:11:08.819 --> 02:11:13.618
Caption: there&#39;s this this piece of string from

02:11:11.819 --> 02:11:15.598
Caption: this chaos

02:11:13.619 --> 02:11:17.459
Caption: all the way you know so it looks nice

02:11:15.599 --> 02:11:19.260
Caption: and harmless here

02:11:17.459 --> 02:11:21.718
Caption: you trust it because it does what you

02:11:19.259 --> 02:11:24.238
Caption: need it to do but it&#39;s a mess

02:11:21.719 --> 02:11:27.300
Caption: all right so who wrote it what checks

02:11:24.238 --> 02:11:29.638
Caption: have they done is it safe and secure or

02:11:27.299 --> 02:11:31.319
Caption: are they you know gonna give your data

02:11:29.639 --> 02:11:34.320
Caption: away

02:11:31.319 --> 02:11:36.359
Caption: oh look look for Jay so if you don&#39;t

02:11:34.319 --> 02:11:38.698
Caption: know what log 4J was it was like the

02:11:36.359 --> 02:11:40.560
Caption: most fun Christmas present uh security

02:11:38.699 --> 02:11:42.119
Caption: team was ever given

02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:44.040
Caption: because basically there was a

02:11:42.119 --> 02:11:47.219
Caption: vulnerability which anyone could exploit

02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:48.659
Caption: by using a URL from memory

02:11:47.219 --> 02:11:50.760
Caption: um and then

02:11:48.659 --> 02:11:52.739
Caption: they patched it and the patch didn&#39;t

02:11:50.759 --> 02:11:54.658
Caption: work so they went through all this

02:11:52.738 --> 02:11:56.039
Caption: trouble to patch it and it didn&#39;t work

02:11:54.659 --> 02:11:57.420
Caption: so then they had to patch it again but

02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:58.919
Caption: then that didn&#39;t work so they had to

02:11:57.419 --> 02:12:00.599
Caption: patch it again and they fixed the

02:11:58.919 --> 02:12:04.560
Caption: problem by actually removing the feature

02:12:00.599 --> 02:12:07.800
Caption: so it was good time and like it was it&#39;s

02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:09.719
Caption: been used in so many places that it was

02:12:07.799 --> 02:12:11.579
Caption: um a real nightmare and the other

02:12:09.719 --> 02:12:13.199
Caption: example we&#39;ve got for this is the tiny

02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:15.199
Caption: file manager which I&#39;d never heard of I

02:12:13.199 --> 02:12:17.280
Caption: actually searched through cve

02:12:15.199 --> 02:12:19.639
Caption: vulnerabilities looking for examples

02:12:17.279 --> 02:12:22.259
Caption: that were pretty straightforward this

02:12:19.639 --> 02:12:25.619
Caption: package allows you to upload files in a

02:12:22.259 --> 02:12:28.079
Caption: website right and this one here if you

02:12:25.619 --> 02:12:30.179
Caption: upload a file and that file has the

02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:31.500
Caption: right file name you can actually put

02:12:30.179 --> 02:12:34.380
Caption: code in the file name and it would

02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:36.238
Caption: execute the code so it um it seemed like

02:12:34.379 --> 02:12:38.939
Caption: a pretty simple one to execute if you

02:12:36.238 --> 02:12:41.039
Caption: knew that it was vulnerable so you know

02:12:38.939 --> 02:12:42.599
Caption: you just want to be able to upload files

02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:45.139
Caption: you don&#39;t care how it does it but maybe

02:12:42.599 --> 02:12:45.139
Caption: you need to

02:12:45.779 --> 02:12:49.158
Caption: okay let&#39;s talk about storing customer

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.139
Caption: data

02:12:49.159 --> 02:12:54.900
Caption: authentication we need to ensure that

02:12:52.139 --> 02:12:57.179
Caption: the user is the person they say they are

02:12:54.899 --> 02:12:59.158
Caption: by authentication this means that only

02:12:57.179 --> 02:13:02.219
Caption: an application is allowed to access

02:12:59.159 --> 02:13:03.900
Caption: certain data for example when we have a

02:13:02.219 --> 02:13:06.420
Caption: server on the back end that manages

02:13:03.899 --> 02:13:09.299
Caption: multiple websites and we only want

02:13:06.419 --> 02:13:12.000
Caption: website a to be allowed to accept to

02:13:09.299 --> 02:13:13.559
Caption: authenticate database B

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.199
Caption: Access Control

02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:18.659
Caption: that means to check if a user is allowed

02:13:16.199 --> 02:13:21.840
Caption: to access an application or a database

02:13:18.659 --> 02:13:24.119
Caption: that he or she is trying to access for

02:13:21.839 --> 02:13:26.339
Caption: instance a human resource manager of a

02:13:24.119 --> 02:13:29.280
Caption: company is allowed to access a database

02:13:26.339 --> 02:13:31.799
Caption: that contains employees information but

02:13:29.279 --> 02:13:34.259
Caption: an IT admin does not this will also

02:13:31.799 --> 02:13:37.399
Caption: prevent Hackers from easily obtaining a

02:13:34.259 --> 02:13:37.399
Caption: company&#39;s sensitive information

02:13:37.799 --> 02:13:42.118
Caption: so this also applies if you&#39;re writing

02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:44.339
Caption: an application you can have a service

02:13:42.119 --> 02:13:46.679
Caption: principle which is like a user account

02:13:44.339 --> 02:13:48.419
Caption: for the application itself you can

02:13:46.679 --> 02:13:50.340
Caption: assign only the permissions that it&#39;s

02:13:48.419 --> 02:13:51.718
Caption: needed so that it can only authenticate

02:13:50.339 --> 02:13:53.040
Caption: against the services it needs to

02:13:51.719 --> 02:13:55.860
Caption: authenticate and then once it&#39;s

02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:57.659
Caption: authenticated it can only access the

02:13:55.859 --> 02:14:00.118
Caption: data or services that it needs to access

02:13:57.659 --> 02:14:02.520
Caption: so it works equally the same with a

02:14:00.119 --> 02:14:05.699
Caption: human or with an application

02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:07.619
Caption: and then we&#39;ve got two more parts around

02:14:05.699 --> 02:14:09.840
Caption: the storing we&#39;re looking at the

02:14:07.619 --> 02:14:13.679
Caption: encrypting data when it&#39;s at rest and

02:14:09.839 --> 02:14:17.218
Caption: when it&#39;s that Transit so just assuming

02:14:13.679 --> 02:14:19.560
Caption: you um your your service is compromised

02:14:17.219 --> 02:14:22.079
Caption: and they are able to steal that data if

02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:23.459
Caption: it&#39;s encrypted at rest uh and you know

02:14:22.079 --> 02:14:26.280
Caption: you haven&#39;t done something silly like

02:14:23.459 --> 02:14:28.198
Caption: put your encryption key in your code

02:14:26.279 --> 02:14:29.879
Caption: um then odds are they&#39;re not going to be

02:14:28.199 --> 02:14:31.800
Caption: able to do much with that blob of data

02:14:29.879 --> 02:14:33.419
Caption: like a modern encryption system it&#39;s

02:14:31.799 --> 02:14:35.339
Caption: such that it can&#39;t be easily cracked

02:14:33.419 --> 02:14:36.859
Caption: even if you&#39;re you know leveraging the

02:14:35.339 --> 02:14:39.299
Caption: power of a nation state

02:14:36.859 --> 02:14:42.540
Caption: and then also in transit when you&#39;re

02:14:39.299 --> 02:14:45.959
Caption: sending data between Network Services or

02:14:42.540 --> 02:14:48.780
Caption: you know a modern web service would have

02:14:45.959 --> 02:14:50.279
Caption: multiple components sending the data

02:14:48.779 --> 02:14:51.479
Caption: between those components you want to

02:14:50.279 --> 02:14:54.178
Caption: make sure you&#39;re using an encrypted

02:14:51.479 --> 02:14:55.259
Caption: Channel because especially if you&#39;re

02:14:54.179 --> 02:14:56.579
Caption: using

02:14:55.259 --> 02:15:00.479
Caption: um you know

02:14:56.579 --> 02:15:02.520
Caption: cheap providers or trying to rationalize

02:15:00.479 --> 02:15:04.199
Caption: across multiple providers

02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:06.359
Caption: sending that data might go over the

02:15:04.199 --> 02:15:07.920
Caption: public internet or I might go over

02:15:06.359 --> 02:15:09.419
Caption: shared channels so if you have your

02:15:07.919 --> 02:15:12.419
Caption: encryption you&#39;re maintaining privacy

02:15:09.419 --> 02:15:15.000
Caption: between your different endpoints so it&#39;s

02:15:12.419 --> 02:15:18.020
Caption: it&#39;s super important to make sure you&#39;re

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.020
Caption: using encryption

02:15:18.839 --> 02:15:22.678
Caption: so

02:15:20.459 --> 02:15:25.020
Caption: we&#39;ve got some key takeaways

02:15:22.679 --> 02:15:27.179
Caption: passwords are terrible

02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:28.799
Caption: if you can move away from passwords

02:15:27.179 --> 02:15:30.540
Caption: probably a bit hard if you&#39;re just

02:15:28.799 --> 02:15:32.879
Caption: writing a web app to you know do your

02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:35.639
Caption: fantasy football or something but you

02:15:32.879 --> 02:15:37.979
Caption: still could you know not to show

02:15:35.639 --> 02:15:39.780
Caption: Microsoft but I work there and you know

02:15:37.979 --> 02:15:43.079
Caption: my authenticator allows you to do

02:15:39.779 --> 02:15:45.539
Caption: password less and I know that other

02:15:43.079 --> 02:15:46.919
Caption: authentication providers allow you to do

02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:51.060
Caption: password like through a push

02:15:46.919 --> 02:15:53.399
Caption: notification so then your device

02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:55.139
Caption: becomes your password

02:15:53.399 --> 02:15:56.879
Caption: and it doesn&#39;t have to be tied to your

02:15:55.139 --> 02:16:00.000
Caption: phone number which is good

02:15:56.879 --> 02:16:03.060
Caption: second software dependencies you rely on

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.759
Caption: might be your undoing so please be sure

02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:07.379
Caption: that your dependencies that your or your

02:16:05.759 --> 02:16:09.419
Caption: your software libraries that you&#39;re

02:16:07.379 --> 02:16:12.060
Caption: using but they&#39;re safe and you&#39;ve got

02:16:09.419 --> 02:16:15.060
Caption: some sort of process to make sure that

02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:17.339
Caption: they stay updated you know

02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:19.260
Caption: you can&#39;t write everything you have to

02:16:17.339 --> 02:16:20.959
Caption: rely on it but you also need to have a

02:16:19.259 --> 02:16:23.578
Caption: process to make sure that it stays safe

02:16:20.959 --> 02:16:25.560
Caption: and lastly make sure you store your data

02:16:23.579 --> 02:16:27.119
Caption: securely because

02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:29.839
Caption: um you know that&#39;s what your customers

02:16:27.119 --> 02:16:29.840
Caption: trust you to do

02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:38.399

Caption: microphone and you can feel really cool

02:16:48.660 --> 02:16:52.500
Caption: like me and talking to it and ask a

02:16:51.058 --> 02:16:55.319
Caption: question

02:16:52.500 --> 02:16:58.018
Caption: come on guys

02:16:55.320 --> 02:17:00.780
Caption: you are my man

02:16:58.018 --> 02:17:02.879
Caption: thanks guys so just quick question on um

02:17:00.780 --> 02:17:05.399
Caption: password so what if he&#39;s out of that

02:17:02.879 --> 02:17:07.500
Caption: like uses like Google to log in is that

02:17:05.399 --> 02:17:10.320
Caption: better than passwords oh yeah

02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:12.540
Caption: yeah like a hyperscaler is going to do a

02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:15.359
Caption: much better job than yourself

02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:17.339
Caption: or you know even if you&#39;re leveraging

02:17:15.359 --> 02:17:19.139
Caption: like a PHP library or something like

02:17:17.339 --> 02:17:21.898
Caption: that just just seeing if you can

02:17:19.138 --> 02:17:25.080
Caption: Outsource to a company that is doing

02:17:21.899 --> 02:17:26.219
Caption: millions of logins a day or a second or

02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:29.299
Caption: whatever then they&#39;re going to have a

02:17:26.218 --> 02:17:29.299
Caption: lot more better protection

02:17:29.518 --> 02:17:34.739
Caption: I&#39;m going to Chuck a question in should

02:17:31.978 --> 02:17:38.459
Caption: I go and put my email address in that

02:17:34.740 --> 02:17:40.979
Caption: have I done porn yes like seriously I

02:17:38.459 --> 02:17:45.000
Caption: should probably do that between yeah

02:17:40.978 --> 02:17:47.839
Caption: yeah okay cool we learn something new

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.839
Caption: every day

02:17:49.919 --> 02:17:55.320
Caption: I just wanted to ask what is your

02:17:52.018 --> 02:17:58.500
Caption: opinion on authentication tokens or the

02:17:55.320 --> 02:18:00.240
Caption: ones that do the generation numbers that

02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:03.058
Caption: some companies give you

02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:04.799
Caption: oh like an RSA token yeah yeah generally

02:18:03.058 --> 02:18:06.959
Caption: pretty safe I mean like because you need

02:18:04.799 --> 02:18:09.178
Caption: to have registered on the device that

02:18:06.959 --> 02:18:10.919
Caption: you trust whether it&#39;s your little token

02:18:09.178 --> 02:18:11.819
Caption: or if it&#39;s the authenticator app on your

02:18:10.919 --> 02:18:14.518
Caption: phone

02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:16.559
Caption: um so there&#39;s only one source of that

02:18:14.518 --> 02:18:18.478
Caption: six digit number to log in

02:18:16.558 --> 02:18:20.279
Caption: right so when you lose your phone it&#39;s a

02:18:18.478 --> 02:18:22.138
Caption: pain in the you know because you

02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:24.359
Caption: sometimes have a whole series of codes

02:18:22.138 --> 02:18:27.779
Caption: that you can use as one-time logins to

02:18:24.359 --> 02:18:29.099
Caption: prove you are who you are but even if

02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:30.540
Caption: someone does a Sim swap they&#39;re not

02:18:29.098 --> 02:18:31.319
Caption: stealing all the data on your phone so

02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:32.939
Caption: if you&#39;ve got like the Google

02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:34.559
Caption: Authenticator Microsoft authenticator

02:18:32.939 --> 02:18:35.460
Caption: LastPass authenticator twilio

02:18:34.558 --> 02:18:37.678
Caption: authenticator like there&#39;s

02:18:35.459 --> 02:18:40.080
Caption: authenticators everywhere if you&#39;re

02:18:37.678 --> 02:18:42.000
Caption: using just one of those then that is the

02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:45.259
Caption: source of truth even if someone steals

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.259
Caption: your password good let them

02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:55.259
Caption: duck there was one here

02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:57.540
Caption: just curious uh you recommended we try

02:18:55.259 --> 02:18:59.160
Caption: to use different passwords for different

02:18:57.540 --> 02:19:02.518
Caption: platforms

02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:04.859
Caption: um I do know we have some free open

02:19:02.518 --> 02:19:07.799
Caption: password manager

02:19:04.859 --> 02:19:09.780
Caption: two do you recommend people to use it if

02:19:07.799 --> 02:19:12.839
Caption: so what kind of tools do you use

02:19:09.780 --> 02:19:15.719
Caption: personally except the kitchen like

02:19:12.839 --> 02:19:20.098
Caption: iPhone Muse so yeah

02:19:15.718 --> 02:19:23.098
Caption: do you use one uh personally I do not

02:19:20.098 --> 02:19:25.080
Caption: but I have my organization people

02:19:23.098 --> 02:19:28.199
Caption: sitting over there and they use Bill

02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:29.700
Caption: Warden as their password manager I hope

02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:31.580
Caption: they don&#39;t kill me when I get off the

02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:34.919
Caption: stage

02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:37.799
Caption: uh I don&#39;t want to read that report

02:19:34.919 --> 02:19:38.759
Caption: um I use LastPass and

02:19:37.799 --> 02:19:41.040
Caption: um

02:19:38.759 --> 02:19:42.660
Caption: LastPass but that one&#39;s a paid one but

02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:45.839
Caption: I&#39;m lucky because I became a customer

02:19:42.660 --> 02:19:48.599
Caption: like 2012 so I knew still pay 12 us a

02:19:45.839 --> 02:19:50.938
Caption: year for it and

02:19:48.598 --> 02:19:54.059
Caption: the other one which is on the have I

02:19:50.939 --> 02:19:56.280
Caption: been owned past uh key pass no

02:19:54.059 --> 02:19:59.459
Caption: one password thank you yes

02:19:56.280 --> 02:20:01.500
Caption: and I also use my phone but it syncs

02:19:59.459 --> 02:20:03.599
Caption: across yeah

02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:06.120
Caption: and so when I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get in

02:20:03.599 --> 02:20:08.040
Caption: trouble you can hack me later on from

02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:11.359
Caption: what I&#39;ve worked out we might make it up

02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:11.359
Caption: we&#39;ll talk about this later

02:20:11.399 --> 02:20:15.060
Caption: yeah all right thanks for that um I was

02:20:13.679 --> 02:20:16.679
Caption: going to ask about password managers as

02:20:15.059 --> 02:20:19.139
Caption: well so some of them are offering the

02:20:16.679 --> 02:20:20.819
Caption: MFA functionality in there as well do

02:20:19.139 --> 02:20:23.398
Caption: you think that&#39;s a good idea having the

02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:24.839
Caption: password and the MFA yes like like one

02:20:23.399 --> 02:20:27.120
Caption: password for example yes and then you

02:20:24.839 --> 02:20:29.580
Caption: mentioned LastPass but even the password

02:20:27.120 --> 02:20:32.399
Caption: managers are getting compromised yes

02:20:29.580 --> 02:20:34.500
Caption: like they had a recent issue in the dev

02:20:32.399 --> 02:20:36.000
Caption: environment I think and I don&#39;t know

02:20:34.500 --> 02:20:38.639
Caption: what do you what&#39;s your take on all that

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:41.099
Caption: so LastPass was compromised only a week

02:20:38.639 --> 02:20:43.199
Caption: or two ago like their servers got done

02:20:41.099 --> 02:20:45.779
Caption: and I&#39;m completely comfortable with that

02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:48.000
Caption: because the way LastPass works is they

02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:49.859
Caption: just get an encrypted blob of data and

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:52.139
Caption: your master password is the key to

02:20:49.859 --> 02:20:54.180
Caption: decrypt that blob of data so

02:20:52.139 --> 02:20:55.858
Caption: and you know if they can guess their

02:20:54.179 --> 02:20:57.120
Caption: password and and that&#39;s not like a

02:20:55.859 --> 02:20:58.380
Caption: random generated one because I have to

02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:00.419
Caption: type it from memory

02:20:58.379 --> 02:21:02.519
Caption: um but it&#39;s still you know almost 20

02:21:00.419 --> 02:21:04.799
Caption: characters long so

02:21:02.519 --> 02:21:07.500
Caption: I feel good about that um I would feel

02:21:04.799 --> 02:21:10.019
Caption: bad if there was like poorly written

02:21:07.500 --> 02:21:12.719
Caption: code which meant they could bypass the

02:21:10.019 --> 02:21:15.419
Caption: encryption key or do it another way then

02:21:12.719 --> 02:21:18.358
Caption: I&#39;d feel really sucky about it um having

02:21:15.419 --> 02:21:20.280
Caption: um the MFA in the same solution as the

02:21:18.359 --> 02:21:22.979
Caption: password manager I&#39;m fine with because

02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:24.839
Caption: my password manager I can log in on like

02:21:22.978 --> 02:21:27.419
Caption: I don&#39;t know how many devices but the

02:21:24.839 --> 02:21:28.978
Caption: MFA still stays on that same device and

02:21:27.419 --> 02:21:32.398
Caption: it&#39;s like that single source of Truth

02:21:28.978 --> 02:21:35.219
Caption: still so if you know you buy a new phone

02:21:32.399 --> 02:21:36.479
Caption: you need to transfer that MFA from one

02:21:35.219 --> 02:21:37.379
Caption: to the other

02:21:36.478 --> 02:21:40.639
Caption: um

02:21:37.379 --> 02:21:40.639
Caption: so yeah it&#39;s pretty good

02:21:47.639 --> 02:21:50.358
Caption: these guys have killed

02:21:52.139 --> 02:21:57.000
Caption: killed it and when I look forward to

02:21:54.419 --> 02:21:58.679
Caption: seeing you next year too

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.080
Caption: all right guys we do have another

02:26:44.759 --> 02:26:48.660

02:33:26.939 --> 02:33:31.520

02:33:31.679 --> 02:33:38.879

02:33:48.839 --> 02:33:53.398
Caption: questions and from what I hear that are

02:33:51.478 --> 02:33:57.299
Caption: signing of the book could be a

02:33:53.399 --> 02:34:00.180
Caption: possibility guys so Josh are we good

02:33:57.299 --> 02:34:02.280
Caption: hopefully let&#39;s give it a red hot coat

02:34:00.179 --> 02:34:03.839
Caption: if you can use that one so we can all

02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:05.520
Caption: hear you I mean people can probably hear

02:34:03.839 --> 02:34:07.938
Caption: me oh God people can probably hear me

02:34:05.519 --> 02:34:10.739
Caption: anyway so I&#39;m generally loud all right

02:34:07.939 --> 02:34:13.800
Caption: serverless testing uh local considered

02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:16.560
Caption: harmful so people may have heard me

02:34:13.799 --> 02:34:18.660
Caption: speak before in which case you might

02:34:16.559 --> 02:34:19.858
Caption: have presumed this warning was coming

02:34:18.660 --> 02:34:22.560
Caption: there&#39;s going to be a lot of strong

02:34:19.859 --> 02:34:24.780
Caption: opinions that hopefully loosely held

02:34:22.559 --> 02:34:26.398
Caption: your mileage may vary I&#39;m not saying I

02:34:24.780 --> 02:34:27.899
Caption: have all the answers just most of them

02:34:26.399 --> 02:34:29.819
Caption: so you know we&#39;ll have to see how that

02:34:27.899 --> 02:34:32.580
Caption: goes right

02:34:29.819 --> 02:34:33.780
Caption: all right the hero slasher villain uh

02:34:32.580 --> 02:34:35.219
Caption: for our story today it&#39;s a friend of

02:34:33.780 --> 02:34:36.780
Caption: mine called Richards who I worked with

02:34:35.219 --> 02:34:38.519
Caption: in the UK

02:34:36.780 --> 02:34:40.319
Caption: um he&#39;s drunk the cloud native Kool-Aid

02:34:38.519 --> 02:34:43.559
Caption: as you can see

02:34:40.319 --> 02:34:46.620
Caption: um that is a suit he actually owns

02:34:43.559 --> 02:34:49.019
Caption: um so when I talk about Cloud native

02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:51.660
Caption: I&#39;m not meaning this Unholy Cambrian

02:34:49.019 --> 02:34:55.199
Caption: explosion of things that the cncf has

02:34:51.660 --> 02:34:58.140
Caption: really it&#39;s building for the cloud not

02:34:55.200 --> 02:35:00.419
Caption: just on the cloud right that can mean

02:34:58.139 --> 02:35:01.438
Caption: kubernetes but I argue in most cases it

02:35:00.419 --> 02:35:04.019
Caption: probably not

02:35:01.439 --> 02:35:06.359
Caption: but okay so

02:35:04.019 --> 02:35:07.919
Caption: back to Richard and we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re

02:35:06.359 --> 02:35:09.479
Caption: gonna start and I always try and start

02:35:07.919 --> 02:35:11.339
Caption: this way so when people get bored of me

02:35:09.478 --> 02:35:12.659
Caption: speaking hopefully they&#39;ve got the

02:35:11.339 --> 02:35:15.059
Caption: takeaways to start so we&#39;re going to

02:35:12.660 --> 02:35:16.859
Caption: start with the three key takeaways

02:35:15.059 --> 02:35:18.358
Caption: the first is that the testing pyramid

02:35:16.859 --> 02:35:20.280
Caption: that we&#39;ve all held dear to our hearts

02:35:18.359 --> 02:35:23.040
Caption: for many many years is a service

02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:24.000
Caption: anti-pattern in reality

02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:25.620
Caption: um hopefully some of these are

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:27.419
Caption: contentious I&#39;m hoping to you know piss

02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:29.459
Caption: people off as we go

02:35:27.419 --> 02:35:30.898
Caption: um again it makes it more fun

02:35:29.459 --> 02:35:32.759
Caption: um second emulating the cloud is a

02:35:30.899 --> 02:35:34.500
Caption: recipe for disappointment I will be

02:35:32.759 --> 02:35:37.019
Caption: ragging on local stack for about half

02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:38.339
Caption: this talk maybe not half but you know

02:35:37.019 --> 02:35:40.199
Caption: you&#39;ve got to go with me on this and

02:35:38.339 --> 02:35:42.120
Caption: hopefully I can convince you to throw it

02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:43.500
Caption: in the bin tomorrow and the last is

02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:45.359
Caption: testing doesn&#39;t stop when code hits

02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:48.120
Caption: production

02:35:45.359 --> 02:35:49.800
Caption: um again hopefully people agree with me

02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:51.899
Caption: on this or they don&#39;t either way

02:35:49.799 --> 02:35:53.398
Caption: hopefully you agree with me by the end

02:35:51.899 --> 02:35:54.840
Caption: um so there&#39;s already an intro on me so

02:35:53.399 --> 02:35:56.040
Caption: I&#39;ll go very very quick

02:35:54.839 --> 02:35:57.478
Caption: um so yeah we&#39;re doing this technology

02:35:56.040 --> 02:35:59.099
Caption: that container which is a ridiculous

02:35:57.478 --> 02:36:01.438
Caption: title

02:35:59.099 --> 02:36:03.379
Caption: um I work with Enterprises I&#39;ve done

02:36:01.439 --> 02:36:05.520
Caption: world first service architecture on AWS

02:36:03.379 --> 02:36:06.780

02:36:06.780 --> 02:36:09.959
Caption: um I am a speaker and I do have a few

02:36:08.219 --> 02:36:12.000
Caption: copies to give away I can sign them if

02:36:09.959 --> 02:36:13.019
Caption: you want but I feel really weird doing

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.399
Caption: it

02:36:13.019 --> 02:36:15.599
Caption: um I&#39;m Dave dos Ambassador hashing

02:36:14.399 --> 02:36:18.920
Caption: Ambassador you know all the kind of

02:36:15.599 --> 02:36:18.919
Caption: stuff I&#39;m a professional lab mouth

02:36:19.019 --> 02:36:23.039
Caption: um so I&#39;m going to talk about functional

02:36:20.879 --> 02:36:25.919
Caption: testing today when I say testing that&#39;s

02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:27.179
Caption: what most people think and there are so

02:36:25.919 --> 02:36:29.938
Caption: many other things you can and should be

02:36:27.179 --> 02:36:32.040
Caption: testing but I have 45 minutes so I&#39;m

02:36:29.939 --> 02:36:34.439
Caption: going to focus or try anyway I generally

02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:37.620
Caption: add lib a lot so we&#39;ll see how this goes

02:36:34.439 --> 02:36:40.080
Caption: uh why do we test and I just realize I

02:36:37.620 --> 02:36:42.660
Caption: have that slide twice why do we test

02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:45.000
Caption: is it to prevent bugs

02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:46.439
Caption: yes and no

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:48.419
Caption: um kind of

02:36:46.439 --> 02:36:49.800
Caption: I&#39;m gonna apologize for this but I&#39;m

02:36:48.419 --> 02:36:51.059
Caption: going to go a little bit of complexity

02:36:49.799 --> 02:36:51.898
Caption: Theory

02:36:51.059 --> 02:36:53.759
Caption: um

02:36:51.899 --> 02:36:55.859
Caption: so when we build systems they are

02:36:53.759 --> 02:36:58.978
Caption: complex adaptive systems

02:36:55.859 --> 02:37:00.479
Caption: it&#39;s a very uh very long way of saying

02:36:58.978 --> 02:37:01.619
Caption: when we make changes we don&#39;t really

02:37:00.478 --> 02:37:03.839
Caption: know what&#39;s going to happen we have

02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:05.819
Caption: ideas we have theories but we can&#39;t know

02:37:03.839 --> 02:37:07.500
Caption: what&#39;s going to happen

02:37:05.819 --> 02:37:09.660
Caption: and if you don&#39;t believe me or this is

02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:12.120
Caption: kind of new I think we&#39;ve all been

02:37:09.660 --> 02:37:14.219
Caption: through this you know you&#39;re working on

02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:17.219
Caption: something you know you get to daily

02:37:14.219 --> 02:37:19.978
Caption: stand-up the next day and yeah no I

02:37:17.219 --> 02:37:21.959
Caption: found something new it&#39;s kind of the

02:37:19.978 --> 02:37:23.398
Caption: it&#39;s the problem in the fun of software

02:37:21.959 --> 02:37:24.719
Caption: development it&#39;s emergent you don&#39;t know

02:37:23.399 --> 02:37:26.880
Caption: what you&#39;re doing until you do it which

02:37:24.719 --> 02:37:29.519
Caption: is why estimating another one of my uh

02:37:26.879 --> 02:37:30.599
Caption: pain points is pointless and that&#39;s

02:37:29.519 --> 02:37:32.639
Caption: probably also going to piss some people

02:37:30.599 --> 02:37:35.398
Caption: off which is fantastic

02:37:32.639 --> 02:37:36.000
Caption: going from complexity Theory

02:37:35.399 --> 02:37:37.859
Caption: um

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.139
Caption: so behaviors of systems of complex

02:37:37.859 --> 02:37:42.060
Caption: adapter systems are emergent property

02:37:40.139 --> 02:37:45.000
Caption: you can try and control them but

02:37:42.059 --> 02:37:47.279
Caption: effectively they happen not 100 by

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:48.299
Caption: chance but just because you build

02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:50.040
Caption: something doesn&#39;t mean you know what

02:37:48.299 --> 02:37:51.839
Caption: it&#39;s going to do

02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:54.540
Caption: this also means that unintended

02:37:51.839 --> 02:37:55.620
Caption: behaviors are emergent property because

02:37:54.540 --> 02:37:58.139
Caption: you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen

02:37:55.620 --> 02:37:59.580
Caption: which that means that bugs an emergent

02:37:58.139 --> 02:38:03.358
Caption: property because bugs is effectively

02:37:59.580 --> 02:38:06.240
Caption: just a synonym for unintended behaviors

02:38:03.359 --> 02:38:07.260
Caption: the bugs are inevitable

02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:08.100
Caption: um you&#39;re really not going to get around

02:38:07.259 --> 02:38:11.339
Caption: them

02:38:08.099 --> 02:38:13.318
Caption: so if testing isn&#39;t about the you know

02:38:11.339 --> 02:38:16.259
Caption: preventing bugs in their entirety what

02:38:13.319 --> 02:38:19.620
Caption: what are you actually trying to achieve

02:38:16.259 --> 02:38:20.879
Caption: really for me it&#39;s this that the value

02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:22.080
Caption: of the release you&#39;re trying to do the

02:38:20.879 --> 02:38:23.938
Caption: value of the change you&#39;re trying to do

02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:24.719
Caption: is greater than the risk of doing the

02:38:23.939 --> 02:38:25.920
Caption: change

02:38:24.719 --> 02:38:27.120
Caption: that&#39;s all you&#39;re trying to really do

02:38:25.919 --> 02:38:28.080
Caption: you&#39;re trying to go actually putting

02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:30.540
Caption: this change of production is more

02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:32.160
Caption: valuable than the potential risk impact

02:38:30.540 --> 02:38:33.359
Caption: you can&#39;t be sure about this it&#39;s all

02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:35.339
Caption: about confidence you can have to be 100

02:38:33.359 --> 02:38:37.140
Caption: confidence even with an ego as big as

02:38:35.339 --> 02:38:39.120
Caption: mine I can never be 100 confident that

02:38:37.139 --> 02:38:41.398
Caption: I&#39;ve got it right

02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:43.020
Caption: um but really what would fundamentally

02:38:41.399 --> 02:38:45.120
Caption: what we&#39;re trying to do is how cheaply

02:38:43.019 --> 02:38:46.500
Caption: can you be confident or sufficiently

02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:49.319
Caption: confident that the value of the release

02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:51.179
Caption: is more than the risk and obviously risk

02:38:49.319 --> 02:38:54.120
Caption: can take many different factors in terms

02:38:51.179 --> 02:38:55.318
Caption: of you break production or unintended or

02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:56.819
Caption: the you know there&#39;s all the damage that

02:38:55.319 --> 02:38:59.280
Caption: comes from that in terms of Financial

02:38:56.819 --> 02:39:00.780
Caption: and reputational and maybe you get

02:38:59.280 --> 02:39:01.919
Caption: smarts across the head because you&#39;ve

02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:03.180
Caption: released so many bugs into production

02:39:01.919 --> 02:39:05.160
Caption: there&#39;s lots of different kinds of risk

02:39:03.179 --> 02:39:07.438
Caption: in there

02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:09.359
Caption: again just stepping back to complexity

02:39:07.439 --> 02:39:10.200
Caption: Theory one last time I promise I&#39;ll move

02:39:09.359 --> 02:39:13.380
Caption: on

02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:15.479
Caption: um when you look at complex area and

02:39:13.379 --> 02:39:17.639
Caption: then you get tesserin are these enabling

02:39:15.478 --> 02:39:19.619
Caption: constraints they allow us to preserve

02:39:17.639 --> 02:39:21.059
Caption: certain behaviors of the system but

02:39:19.620 --> 02:39:22.139
Caption: they&#39;re not guaranteed to exercise the

02:39:21.059 --> 02:39:22.978
Caption: entirety of the system so you&#39;re not

02:39:22.139 --> 02:39:25.379
Caption: going to cover everything but you&#39;re

02:39:22.978 --> 02:39:29.159
Caption: going to cover a lot

02:39:25.379 --> 02:39:30.540
Caption: Google very eloquently put it uh like

02:39:29.160 --> 02:39:32.640
Caption: this

02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:34.439
Caption: um the Beyonce rule if you liked it you

02:39:32.639 --> 02:39:36.599
Caption: should have put a CI test on it Google

02:39:34.439 --> 02:39:38.880
Caption: have taken this idea to the extreme with

02:39:36.599 --> 02:39:40.139
Caption: the idea that anyone in the business can

02:39:38.879 --> 02:39:41.580
Caption: make pretty much any change to any

02:39:40.139 --> 02:39:43.978
Caption: system that they want

02:39:41.580 --> 02:39:45.599
Caption: so upgrading a package take the log4j

02:39:43.978 --> 02:39:47.579
Caption: thing that happened right Google can

02:39:45.599 --> 02:39:49.259
Caption: update that in their one giant monorepo

02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:51.719
Caption: they are insane

02:39:49.259 --> 02:39:53.879
Caption: um but that can be done by security and

02:39:51.719 --> 02:39:55.500
Caption: if your system breaks it is your fault

02:39:53.879 --> 02:39:57.179
Caption: not theirs

02:39:55.500 --> 02:39:58.379
Caption: so it&#39;s changing with accountability

02:39:57.179 --> 02:39:59.459
Caption: lies from the person that made the

02:39:58.379 --> 02:40:01.620
Caption: change the person that owns the system

02:39:59.459 --> 02:40:03.478
Caption: but fundamentally Google has probably

02:40:01.620 --> 02:40:07.100
Caption: second to non-testing culture and it

02:40:03.478 --> 02:40:07.099
Caption: enables a lot of the stuff that they do

02:40:07.139 --> 02:40:10.919
Caption: again

02:40:08.339 --> 02:40:12.478
Caption: when we build a system we have a mental

02:40:10.919 --> 02:40:14.700
Caption: model of how we think the system works

02:40:12.478 --> 02:40:16.679
Caption: and we have a software model which is

02:40:14.700 --> 02:40:18.240
Caption: how the system actually works and

02:40:16.679 --> 02:40:19.858
Caption: testing is an opportunity to refine our

02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:21.600
Caption: mental to try and bring it closer to the

02:40:19.859 --> 02:40:23.160
Caption: software model and the closer you are

02:40:21.599 --> 02:40:24.540
Caption: the better the quicker you can develop

02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:26.640
Caption: the less bugs you&#39;re going to introduce

02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:27.719
Caption: this is kind of the basis around you

02:40:26.639 --> 02:40:28.919
Caption: know when you&#39;re on board onto a new

02:40:27.719 --> 02:40:29.938
Caption: team you have to understand what&#39;s going

02:40:28.919 --> 02:40:33.299
Caption: on right

02:40:29.939 --> 02:40:34.800
Caption: so as you know you have to build these

02:40:33.299 --> 02:40:35.938
Caption: mental models over time which is why you

02:40:34.799 --> 02:40:37.259
Caption: get the guys who&#39;ve worked on the system

02:40:35.939 --> 02:40:38.580
Caption: for 20 years seem to know everything

02:40:37.259 --> 02:40:39.660
Caption: backwards and forwards and the guy&#39;s

02:40:38.580 --> 02:40:42.259
Caption: been there two months it&#39;s like what the

02:40:39.660 --> 02:40:42.259
Caption: hell is going on

02:40:42.599 --> 02:40:47.459
Caption: really common refrain that I see when

02:40:45.120 --> 02:40:49.979
Caption: people start on the serverless bit is

02:40:47.459 --> 02:40:51.000
Caption: they find that testing just feels really

02:40:49.978 --> 02:40:52.318
Caption: hard

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Caption: it feels really hard for them to do

02:40:52.319 --> 02:40:55.680
Caption: they&#39;re like it doesn&#39;t work the way it

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.700
Caption: used to

02:40:55.679 --> 02:40:57.779
Caption: um you know I&#39;m starting to do a whole

02:40:56.700 --> 02:41:00.060
Caption: bunch of different things it&#39;s not

02:40:57.780 --> 02:41:01.680
Caption: really working like all of a sudden I

02:41:00.059 --> 02:41:03.299
Caption: need Docker compose to run like 10

02:41:01.679 --> 02:41:05.099
Caption: containers on my laptop and it&#39;s set on

02:41:03.299 --> 02:41:07.679
Caption: fire that kind of stuff that you see

02:41:05.099 --> 02:41:09.419
Caption: happening around the track right

02:41:07.679 --> 02:41:11.759
Caption: the fundamental problems that although

02:41:09.419 --> 02:41:13.799
Caption: serverless you know Lambda functions and

02:41:11.759 --> 02:41:15.540
Caption: Cloud run and visual functions all that

02:41:13.799 --> 02:41:17.160
Caption: wonderful stuff although there is

02:41:15.540 --> 02:41:20.520
Caption: technology Service as a whole is

02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:22.200
Caption: actually a mindset it&#39;s not just about

02:41:20.519 --> 02:41:23.759
Caption: moving the technology it&#39;s a new

02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:25.680
Caption: paradigm that comes with new ways of

02:41:23.759 --> 02:41:27.179
Caption: working if you try and apply all the

02:41:25.679 --> 02:41:29.580
Caption: ways you used to do things in like a

02:41:27.179 --> 02:41:31.259
Caption: monolithic on-premise environment to a

02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:32.639
Caption: serverless environment you can have a

02:41:31.259 --> 02:41:34.019
Caption: bad time which is what a lot of people

02:41:32.639 --> 02:41:35.699
Caption: do

02:41:34.019 --> 02:41:37.079
Caption: if you try and do Cloud native

02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:40.799
Caption: development with a pre-cloud testing

02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:42.419
Caption: approach local Dev sub is hellish you

02:41:40.799 --> 02:41:43.919
Caption: know the working with some Enterprises

02:41:42.419 --> 02:41:45.299
Caption: like oh someone&#39;s onboarding cool all

02:41:43.919 --> 02:41:47.219
Caption: right well it might have the laptops out

02:41:45.299 --> 02:41:48.478
Caption: ready to go in two weeks it&#39;s like

02:41:47.219 --> 02:41:50.279
Caption: that&#39;s a lot of time I&#39;ve worked on

02:41:48.478 --> 02:41:52.079
Caption: teams where we had people joining

02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:53.760
Caption: pushing to production within an hour of

02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:55.859
Caption: joining if you get this stuff right you

02:41:53.759 --> 02:41:57.419
Caption: can move so fast testing across multiple

02:41:55.859 --> 02:41:58.620
Caption: Services is brittle

02:41:57.419 --> 02:42:00.240
Caption: um this is something people find when

02:41:58.620 --> 02:42:02.639
Caption: they go to microservices like oh my God

02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:04.620
Caption: what what is this how do I get the same

02:42:02.639 --> 02:42:06.120
Caption: level of confidence and really comes

02:42:04.620 --> 02:42:08.459
Caption: down to the tests they write are either

02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:09.600
Caption: really hard they&#39;re hard to be impactful

02:42:08.459 --> 02:42:11.519
Caption: because either they&#39;re very brittle and

02:42:09.599 --> 02:42:12.898
Caption: really hard to work with or they&#39;re kind

02:42:11.519 --> 02:42:14.699
Caption: of tortological tests are really not

02:42:12.899 --> 02:42:16.080
Caption: testing anything at all and they kind of

02:42:14.700 --> 02:42:17.339
Caption: end up in this really weird space where

02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:18.899
Caption: they&#39;re like I don&#39;t have any confidence

02:42:17.339 --> 02:42:20.099
Caption: that my system even works when I make a

02:42:18.899 --> 02:42:21.899
Caption: change

02:42:20.099 --> 02:42:24.419
Caption: and coming back to this serverless as a

02:42:21.899 --> 02:42:28.020
Caption: mindset piece there&#39;s kind of Three core

02:42:24.419 --> 02:42:30.359
Caption: drivers that led to it and they all have

02:42:28.019 --> 02:42:31.019
Caption: impacts on the way you test

02:42:30.359 --> 02:42:33.240
Caption: um

02:42:31.019 --> 02:42:36.299
Caption: so these are kind of wider macroeconomic

02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:39.000
Caption: things but really this is what the cloud

02:42:36.299 --> 02:42:41.580
Caption: to a large degree has brought to it and

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:42.839
Caption: businesses so it historically and

02:42:41.580 --> 02:42:44.399
Caption: unfortunately still in some places seen

02:42:42.839 --> 02:42:45.540
Caption: as a cost center

02:42:44.399 --> 02:42:47.459
Caption: um you don&#39;t want it to be you want to

02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:49.319
Caption: see The Innovation Center

02:42:47.459 --> 02:42:51.299
Caption: um with that comes a very different

02:42:49.319 --> 02:42:54.959
Caption: level of expectation you are expected to

02:42:51.299 --> 02:42:56.580
Caption: produce value not maintain costs ideally

02:42:54.959 --> 02:42:58.620
Caption: um generally we&#39;re moving to model lists

02:42:56.580 --> 02:42:59.580
Caption: the microservices if you&#39;re going down a

02:42:58.620 --> 02:43:01.080
Caption: serverless path you&#39;re going to end up

02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:02.459
Caption: doing microservices that kind of is no

02:43:01.080 --> 02:43:04.200
Caption: way about it and you know if you&#39;re

02:43:02.459 --> 02:43:05.459
Caption: deploying one Lambda it&#39;s God that does

02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:07.560
Caption: everything

02:43:05.459 --> 02:43:08.580
Caption: um think again

02:43:07.559 --> 02:43:11.099
Caption: um

02:43:08.580 --> 02:43:12.179
Caption: and one of the more interesting bits

02:43:11.099 --> 02:43:13.799
Caption: especially compared to a on-premise

02:43:12.179 --> 02:43:16.139
Caption: world that used to be long lead times oh

02:43:13.799 --> 02:43:17.759
Caption: I need a new server setting up okay the

02:43:16.139 --> 02:43:19.978
Caption: best case is maybe it goes to the server

02:43:17.759 --> 02:43:21.898
Caption: team that goes and sets something up the

02:43:19.978 --> 02:43:23.639
Caption: worst case is oh we were out of capacity

02:43:21.899 --> 02:43:24.780
Caption: we&#39;re going to go find a server come

02:43:23.639 --> 02:43:26.580
Caption: back in three months we might have

02:43:24.780 --> 02:43:27.660
Caption: something for you right

02:43:26.580 --> 02:43:30.599
Caption: it&#39;s

02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:32.219
Caption: really different nowadays and just on

02:43:30.599 --> 02:43:33.779
Caption: that Innovation set the point because if

02:43:32.219 --> 02:43:35.339
Caption: people know me they know I&#39;d never shut

02:43:33.780 --> 02:43:36.720
Caption: up about the door metrics and I&#39;ve

02:43:35.339 --> 02:43:37.740
Caption: managed to find a way to fit them in

02:43:36.719 --> 02:43:41.519
Caption: again

02:43:37.740 --> 02:43:42.600
Caption: there so the reality is that nowadays we

02:43:41.519 --> 02:43:44.459
Caption: actually have some statistically

02:43:42.599 --> 02:43:47.580
Caption: verified ways of looking at engineering

02:43:44.459 --> 02:43:49.379
Caption: performance and it is not velocity

02:43:47.580 --> 02:43:52.200
Caption: um the idea is you should be able to

02:43:49.379 --> 02:43:53.759
Caption: deliver change frequently routinely you

02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:55.080
Caption: don&#39;t break things very often and when

02:43:53.759 --> 02:43:57.419
Caption: you do break things it&#39;s quick to fix

02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:58.979
Caption: now a lot of the time people come back

02:43:57.419 --> 02:44:00.540
Caption: and go well okay that&#39;s all right for

02:43:58.978 --> 02:44:01.978
Caption: the digital natives the Googles whatever

02:44:00.540 --> 02:44:05.040
Caption: blah blah

02:44:01.978 --> 02:44:07.559
Caption: the reality is nowadays it&#39;s 26 percent

02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:08.879
Caption: of businesses one in four from the

02:44:07.559 --> 02:44:10.139
Caption: survey respondents so obviously there&#39;s

02:44:08.879 --> 02:44:13.559
Caption: going to be a bias there but you can

02:44:10.139 --> 02:44:15.239
Caption: even see over time 7 to 20 26. this is

02:44:13.559 --> 02:44:17.040
Caption: not about digital natives anymore this

02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:19.140
Caption: is about table Stakes

02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:20.580
Caption: if you can&#39;t do this

02:44:19.139 --> 02:44:21.719
Caption: um you&#39;re really going to run into stuff

02:44:20.580 --> 02:44:22.740
Caption: if you&#39;re not moving in this direction

02:44:21.719 --> 02:44:24.120
Caption: you&#39;re really going to start to run into

02:44:22.740 --> 02:44:25.379
Caption: problems all of a sudden the business

02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:28.319
Caption: can be like well our competitors

02:44:25.379 --> 02:44:30.660
Caption: innovating so much faster than us it go

02:44:28.319 --> 02:44:32.580
Caption: faster we&#39;ve done safe now you can go

02:44:30.660 --> 02:44:34.740
Caption: faster right and we&#39;ve added more scrum

02:44:32.580 --> 02:44:37.200
Caption: Masters we&#39;re going to go faster

02:44:34.740 --> 02:44:38.520
Caption: not how it works at all

02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:40.560
Caption: um so now on the monolith versus

02:44:38.519 --> 02:44:43.559
Caption: microservice it&#39;s about

02:44:40.559 --> 02:44:45.239
Caption: the the way it used to be

02:44:43.559 --> 02:44:47.219
Caption: um was used to have a simple arrangement

02:44:45.240 --> 02:44:48.899
Caption: of complex objects you had virtual

02:44:47.219 --> 02:44:51.540
Caption: machines that did a hell of a lot and

02:44:48.899 --> 02:44:53.040
Caption: not that many of them

02:44:51.540 --> 02:44:54.959
Caption: where it&#39;s kind of gone to now

02:44:53.040 --> 02:44:56.339
Caption: especially in service applications is

02:44:54.959 --> 02:44:58.379
Caption: it&#39;s a complex arrangement of simple

02:44:56.339 --> 02:44:59.938
Caption: objects everything is easy to read is

02:44:58.379 --> 02:45:03.240
Caption: about in isolation but instead the

02:44:59.939 --> 02:45:04.920
Caption: complexity is actually moved from within

02:45:03.240 --> 02:45:06.419
Caption: the service to the Integrations between

02:45:04.919 --> 02:45:08.639
Caption: services

02:45:06.419 --> 02:45:10.438
Caption: so now when you&#39;re trying to test the

02:45:08.639 --> 02:45:11.580
Caption: whole kit and caboodle on a monolith and

02:45:10.439 --> 02:45:12.479
Caption: then you try and do the same in a Lambda

02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:14.160
Caption: function you&#39;re not going to have a good

02:45:12.478 --> 02:45:15.539
Caption: time because what you&#39;re trying to do is

02:45:14.160 --> 02:45:16.919
Caption: get to the heart of the complexity and

02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:18.599
Caption: the complexities actually moved where it

02:45:16.919 --> 02:45:21.120
Caption: is

02:45:18.599 --> 02:45:22.500
Caption: the test pyramids everyone&#39;s familiar

02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:23.399
Caption: surely

02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:26.280
Caption: um

02:45:23.399 --> 02:45:27.720
Caption: so this doesn&#39;t this really starts to

02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:29.160
Caption: not apply

02:45:27.719 --> 02:45:31.379
Caption: anymore

02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:33.419
Caption: because really a lot of that complexity

02:45:31.379 --> 02:45:34.679
Caption: that we used to kind of capture within

02:45:33.419 --> 02:45:37.459
Caption: the unit testing start to move to

02:45:34.679 --> 02:45:37.459
Caption: integration testing

02:45:37.559 --> 02:45:43.679
Caption: Spotify came up with this I

02:45:40.620 --> 02:45:46.200
Caption: it&#39;s better I mean all models um all

02:45:43.679 --> 02:45:47.818
Caption: models are wrong some are useful it you

02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:49.399
Caption: know it starts to actually point to the

02:45:47.819 --> 02:45:52.260
Caption: fact that actually integration testing

02:45:49.399 --> 02:45:53.520
Caption: unfortunately because there are caveats

02:45:52.259 --> 02:45:55.019
Caption: on speed

02:45:53.519 --> 02:45:56.459
Caption: um it&#39;s starting to get the more

02:45:55.019 --> 02:45:58.799
Caption: important part to do

02:45:56.459 --> 02:46:00.419
Caption: and really when you look at this there

02:45:58.799 --> 02:46:01.978
Caption: are conversations we had about how

02:46:00.419 --> 02:46:04.379
Caption: complex what are you actually trying to

02:46:01.978 --> 02:46:06.059
Caption: achieve and this will speak to kind of

02:46:04.379 --> 02:46:07.679
Caption: the years I&#39;ve spent working on AWS

02:46:06.059 --> 02:46:09.358
Caption: platforms when you talk about this

02:46:07.679 --> 02:46:11.519
Caption: complex we look at Lambda functions

02:46:09.359 --> 02:46:14.040
Caption: there are kind of two general types I

02:46:11.519 --> 02:46:15.719
Caption: see there is address Lambda is glue

02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:17.339
Caption: because AWS haven&#39;t done something so

02:46:15.719 --> 02:46:18.059
Caption: you write a Lambda function to do it for

02:46:17.339 --> 02:46:19.858
Caption: them

02:46:18.059 --> 02:46:21.358
Caption: um which is you know all the time and

02:46:19.859 --> 02:46:22.680
Caption: really at this point you&#39;re probably

02:46:21.359 --> 02:46:24.660
Caption: gonna have all integration tests and

02:46:22.679 --> 02:46:27.120
Caption: very little implementation detail tests

02:46:24.660 --> 02:46:29.399
Caption: because

02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:30.899
Caption: your implementation detail really

02:46:29.399 --> 02:46:32.399
Caption: doesn&#39;t mean anything anymore because if

02:46:30.899 --> 02:46:33.600
Caption: you take that code out of AWS it&#39;s

02:46:32.399 --> 02:46:35.220
Caption: useless

02:46:33.599 --> 02:46:36.839
Caption: so what you know you don&#39;t have this

02:46:35.219 --> 02:46:38.938
Caption: nice pure domain you&#39;re trying to look

02:46:36.839 --> 02:46:40.019
Caption: after it&#39;s about like well actually all

02:46:38.939 --> 02:46:41.460
Caption: I&#39;m trying to do is Stitch to radio

02:46:40.019 --> 02:46:44.159
Caption: Services together there is nothing

02:46:41.459 --> 02:46:45.419
Caption: reusable here so really all I need to do

02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:47.339
Caption: is integrate against AWS Services it&#39;s

02:46:45.419 --> 02:46:48.419
Caption: not really point trying to configure it

02:46:47.339 --> 02:46:50.339
Caption: so you can test something locally

02:46:48.419 --> 02:46:51.839
Caption: because what what is the point and I&#39;ll

02:46:50.339 --> 02:46:54.120
Caption: get into more about how you can kind of

02:46:51.839 --> 02:46:55.259
Caption: test in AWS a little bit more natively

02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:56.700
Caption: as we go along

02:46:55.259 --> 02:46:58.559
Caption: the kind of more interesting one

02:46:56.700 --> 02:46:59.759
Caption: personally is with the main logic we&#39;re

02:46:58.559 --> 02:47:02.339
Caption: actually trying to build like a system

02:46:59.759 --> 02:47:04.438
Caption: of some form that Services users not

02:47:02.339 --> 02:47:05.639
Caption: just makes AWS go quicker

02:47:04.439 --> 02:47:07.020
Caption: um and at this point you do end up with

02:47:05.639 --> 02:47:08.580
Caption: a mix of integration implementation

02:47:07.019 --> 02:47:11.459
Caption: detail

02:47:08.580 --> 02:47:13.679
Caption: one of the core things to do when you&#39;re

02:47:11.459 --> 02:47:15.780
Caption: doing serverless development is all the

02:47:13.679 --> 02:47:17.639
Caption: side effects now if there&#39;s any

02:47:15.780 --> 02:47:19.140
Caption: functional programmers in the room

02:47:17.639 --> 02:47:20.759
Caption: they&#39;ll be very used to the comments

02:47:19.139 --> 02:47:21.540
Caption: like talk about side effects as a

02:47:20.759 --> 02:47:23.219
Caption: concept

02:47:21.540 --> 02:47:24.359
Caption: you want to keep your domain logic like

02:47:23.219 --> 02:47:26.459
Caption: the business logic of what you&#39;re trying

02:47:24.359 --> 02:47:27.959
Caption: to do that should be kept pure if

02:47:26.459 --> 02:47:30.120
Caption: there&#39;s anything if there&#39;s any Bodo

02:47:27.959 --> 02:47:32.879
Caption: calls or AWS SDK calls anyway in your

02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:35.040
Caption: business logic you&#39;ve got a problem

02:47:32.879 --> 02:47:37.919
Caption: the business logic shouldn&#39;t know it&#39;s

02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:39.240
Caption: going into AWS or gcp or Azure or you

02:47:37.919 --> 02:47:42.359
Caption: know a Raspberry Pi you&#39;ve got sitting

02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:44.160
Caption: on the desk it really shouldn&#39;t know

02:47:42.359 --> 02:47:45.780
Caption: at the point you&#39;ve made it so it

02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:48.240
Caption: doesn&#39;t know

02:47:45.780 --> 02:47:50.879
Caption: now I can test locally

02:47:48.240 --> 02:47:52.560
Caption: because it&#39;s it&#39;s just logic that&#39;s

02:47:50.879 --> 02:47:54.898
Caption: working it doesn&#39;t understand about any

02:47:52.559 --> 02:47:56.519
Caption: external dependencies in any way so from

02:47:54.899 --> 02:47:58.620
Caption: my domain logic I can actually iterate

02:47:56.519 --> 02:48:01.500
Caption: on that very locally very very quickly

02:47:58.620 --> 02:48:03.240
Caption: then I can independently test that the

02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:04.859
Caption: drivers I&#39;ve got that are interacting

02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:06.839
Caption: with the cloud vendor

02:48:04.859 --> 02:48:09.200
Caption: our work is expected and then some

02:48:06.839 --> 02:48:12.780
Caption: end-to-end tests to stitch it together

02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:14.280
Caption: this forces you to structure your code

02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:15.839
Caption: in a particular way I didn&#39;t have enough

02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:17.819
Caption: time to kind of go into a lot of depth

02:48:15.839 --> 02:48:19.379
Caption: with it today but if you go look at

02:48:17.819 --> 02:48:21.180
Caption: clean architecture there&#39;s a book

02:48:19.379 --> 02:48:22.919
Caption: floating around there if you have a look

02:48:21.179 --> 02:48:23.818
Caption: at the way they structure code

02:48:22.919 --> 02:48:24.898
Caption: um that&#39;s generally how we do it

02:48:23.819 --> 02:48:27.419
Caption: nowaday&#39;s been doing for a few years

02:48:24.899 --> 02:48:28.979
Caption: it&#39;s worked very well for this

02:48:27.419 --> 02:48:30.419
Caption: um potentially how I go on time and I

02:48:28.978 --> 02:48:31.799
Caption: know I&#39;m stopping everyone from lunch I

02:48:30.419 --> 02:48:34.700
Caption: might have a chance to show an example

02:48:31.799 --> 02:48:34.700
Caption: but we&#39;ll see how we go

02:48:35.459 --> 02:48:38.519
Caption: um

02:48:36.359 --> 02:48:39.899
Caption: one of these things is when you get to

02:48:38.519 --> 02:48:41.938
Caption: this point

02:48:39.899 --> 02:48:43.380
Caption: um you can this is a make file that I

02:48:41.939 --> 02:48:44.939
Caption: use there&#39;s a Three Musketeers pattern

02:48:43.379 --> 02:48:46.200
Caption: we use at Contino which I&#39;m a big

02:48:44.939 --> 02:48:47.280
Caption: proponent of

02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:48.479
Caption: um effectively you abstract all your

02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:49.680
Caption: repos and make files to make it

02:48:48.478 --> 02:48:52.500
Caption: wonderful

02:48:49.679 --> 02:48:53.879
Caption: um this is a internal project the make

02:48:52.500 --> 02:48:55.319
Caption: file from an internal project and I&#39;ve

02:48:53.879 --> 02:48:56.700
Caption: abstract it a little bit and taken some

02:48:55.319 --> 02:48:58.080
Caption: stuff out but when you look at testing

02:48:56.700 --> 02:49:00.299
Caption: and kind of setting up local development

02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:01.799
Caption: there&#39;s no Docker nonsense in here

02:49:00.299 --> 02:49:03.240
Caption: there&#39;s no setting up databases there&#39;s

02:49:01.799 --> 02:49:05.700
Caption: no orchestrating a million dependencies

02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:07.799
Caption: locally to do things and they have split

02:49:05.700 --> 02:49:10.140
Caption: my tests up into integration and not

02:49:07.799 --> 02:49:11.700
Caption: integration so I can very easily run my

02:49:10.139 --> 02:49:13.739
Caption: local tests that&#39;ll run really fast and

02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:15.000
Caption: check all my domain logic works and then

02:49:13.740 --> 02:49:16.799
Caption: I can run integration tests and

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:18.240
Caption: separation and then for CI I&#39;ve got to

02:49:16.799 --> 02:49:20.219
Caption: test everything on report coverage right

02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:21.479
Caption: because when you struck to the test like

02:49:20.219 --> 02:49:22.438
Caption: that to get coverage you kind of need

02:49:21.478 --> 02:49:24.000
Caption: both running and they&#39;ve got some

02:49:22.439 --> 02:49:26.100
Caption: end-to-end stuff that I did with bdd and

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:28.978
Caption: behave in in this example

02:49:26.099 --> 02:49:31.019
Caption: but really I always

02:49:28.978 --> 02:49:33.959
Caption: um shudder to think when I see what

02:49:31.019 --> 02:49:36.179
Caption: level of complexity people take on to

02:49:33.959 --> 02:49:37.559
Caption: try and get their testing apparatus set

02:49:36.179 --> 02:49:39.299
Caption: up like okay now I&#39;ve got to run Docker

02:49:37.559 --> 02:49:41.339
Caption: I&#39;ve got to run local stack oh I have to

02:49:39.299 --> 02:49:42.839
Caption: kind of actually get on top of the AWS

02:49:41.339 --> 02:49:45.059
Caption: SDK that I&#39;m using to make sure it&#39;s

02:49:42.839 --> 02:49:47.219
Caption: actually point to local stack apis

02:49:45.059 --> 02:49:49.559
Caption: okay that you know all of a sudden it&#39;s

02:49:47.219 --> 02:49:51.898
Caption: like well it worked on my machine yeah

02:49:49.559 --> 02:49:52.799
Caption: who cares like that so not a valuable

02:49:51.899 --> 02:49:54.420
Caption: thing

02:49:52.799 --> 02:49:55.799
Caption: um you want to be actually I want it to

02:49:54.419 --> 02:49:58.379
Caption: work in address I want to be confident

02:49:55.799 --> 02:49:59.759
Caption: that it works and really the amount of

02:49:58.379 --> 02:50:01.740
Caption: competition get locally is pretty pretty

02:49:59.759 --> 02:50:03.478
Caption: low when it comes down to it

02:50:01.740 --> 02:50:04.919
Caption: this is a really interesting one I find

02:50:03.478 --> 02:50:06.239
Caption: in serverless

02:50:04.919 --> 02:50:08.759
Caption: um because I&#39;ve done it and it&#39;s quite

02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:10.979
Caption: quite a cool thing to do like the

02:50:08.759 --> 02:50:14.398
Caption: testing heuristic like if if you kept

02:50:10.978 --> 02:50:16.318
Caption: all your tests but deleted all the code

02:50:14.399 --> 02:50:18.600
Caption: how confident are you that if you wrote

02:50:16.319 --> 02:50:20.640
Caption: a new code it would work would you feel

02:50:18.599 --> 02:50:23.159
Caption: confident running that to production yes

02:50:20.639 --> 02:50:24.540
Caption: or no I&#39;ve gone through the point of

02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:25.799
Caption: actually deleting functions because I

02:50:24.540 --> 02:50:27.179
Caption: hated the way I read it initially and

02:50:25.799 --> 02:50:29.700
Caption: rewrote it and pushed that to production

02:50:27.179 --> 02:50:31.259
Caption: with sufficient testing like this is the

02:50:29.700 --> 02:50:32.939
Caption: best heuristic I&#39;ve found in the case of

02:50:31.259 --> 02:50:35.639
Caption: like okay well how do I know that my

02:50:32.939 --> 02:50:37.020
Caption: tests are sufficient and it this is the

02:50:35.639 --> 02:50:38.040
Caption: best thing like if you lose your code

02:50:37.019 --> 02:50:39.179
Caption: today but you&#39;ve got your testing there

02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:40.620
Caption: you should be able to get close back to

02:50:39.179 --> 02:50:43.160
Caption: production quality very very very

02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:43.160
Caption: quickly

02:50:43.259 --> 02:50:48.120
Caption: um yeah uh local stack I&#39;ve already

02:50:46.319 --> 02:50:49.379
Caption: mentioned in more times than I plan to

02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:52.020
Caption: but now I&#39;m going to mention it a whole

02:50:49.379 --> 02:50:53.700
Caption: bunch more either so I can run locally I

02:50:52.019 --> 02:50:56.039
Caption: am saved

02:50:53.700 --> 02:50:59.399
Caption: um now I&#39;ve done projects with local

02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:01.559
Caption: stack I I&#39;ve done done a lot with it to

02:50:59.399 --> 02:51:02.520
Caption: be honest in the past

02:51:01.559 --> 02:51:05.639
Caption: um

02:51:02.519 --> 02:51:07.799
Caption: it&#39;s just not how to do things in the

02:51:05.639 --> 02:51:10.620
Caption: cloud native sense yes you can emulate

02:51:07.799 --> 02:51:12.419
Caption: your address locally but why what what

02:51:10.620 --> 02:51:14.219
Caption: actually leads us down the path of test

02:51:12.419 --> 02:51:17.898
Caption: doubles because generally in the past it

02:51:14.219 --> 02:51:17.898
Caption: was yeah at a testable at a mark

02:51:18.019 --> 02:51:23.219
Caption: run some kind of slimmed down system

02:51:20.939 --> 02:51:24.720
Caption: that kind of responds like the real

02:51:23.219 --> 02:51:26.639
Caption: thing

02:51:24.719 --> 02:51:28.500
Caption: and they&#39;re fundamentally for when

02:51:26.639 --> 02:51:30.478
Caption: orchestrating the dependency was too

02:51:28.500 --> 02:51:33.419
Caption: expensive now

02:51:30.478 --> 02:51:35.279
Caption: what classifies as expensive in here can

02:51:33.419 --> 02:51:36.898
Caption: be the amount of time it takes to

02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:38.580
Caption: substantiate maybe as a high running

02:51:36.899 --> 02:51:40.439
Caption: cost maybe you have to talk with other

02:51:38.580 --> 02:51:42.899
Caption: teams to set them up like obviously if

02:51:40.439 --> 02:51:44.640
Caption: you&#39;ve got a sap install or something

02:51:42.899 --> 02:51:46.920
Caption: like that you can&#39;t just run up a new

02:51:44.639 --> 02:51:48.540
Caption: sap install to test against that&#39;s not a

02:51:46.919 --> 02:51:50.099
Caption: realistic thing to do and I&#39;ll talk

02:51:48.540 --> 02:51:51.780
Caption: about some strategies you can use for

02:51:50.099 --> 02:51:54.358
Caption: that as we go on a little bit but

02:51:51.780 --> 02:51:56.640
Caption: generally in serverless like yeah you&#39;re

02:51:54.359 --> 02:51:58.919
Caption: trying to show that actually managing

02:51:56.639 --> 02:52:01.019
Caption: independency is more expensive than the

02:51:58.919 --> 02:52:03.500
Caption: test double therefore the test double is

02:52:01.019 --> 02:52:03.500
Caption: worth having

02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:07.439
Caption: but when you get to serverless

02:52:05.339 --> 02:52:10.259
Caption: all those things that kind of drove the

02:52:07.439 --> 02:52:12.180
Caption: dependency costs are no longer true

02:52:10.259 --> 02:52:13.919
Caption: um hard to configure you&#39;ve got

02:52:12.179 --> 02:52:16.620
Caption: infrastructure as code you know running

02:52:13.919 --> 02:52:17.938
Caption: up a Dynamo tables 20 seconds like it&#39;s

02:52:16.620 --> 02:52:20.879
Caption: not that hard to actually configure

02:52:17.939 --> 02:52:22.979
Caption: anymore High running costs most server

02:52:20.879 --> 02:52:24.120
Caption: stuff is completely paper use if you&#39;re

02:52:22.978 --> 02:52:25.619
Caption: using it for testing and just leave it

02:52:24.120 --> 02:52:28.500
Caption: alone it will cost

02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:30.240
Caption: cents a month right when you contrast to

02:52:28.500 --> 02:52:32.459
Caption: compare this about how much a developer

02:52:30.240 --> 02:52:34.020
Caption: costs a day and I normally use kind of a

02:52:32.459 --> 02:52:35.279
Caption: benchmark of roughly a thousand dollars

02:52:34.019 --> 02:52:37.559
Caption: a day

02:52:35.279 --> 02:52:39.540
Caption: any time like if my developer has to

02:52:37.559 --> 02:52:41.398
Caption: spend two minutes on this every day it&#39;s

02:52:39.540 --> 02:52:43.500
Caption: more expensive than just running all the

02:52:41.399 --> 02:52:44.819
Caption: stuff leaving all the stuff running and

02:52:43.500 --> 02:52:46.319
Caption: generally in serverless if you&#39;re doing

02:52:44.819 --> 02:52:47.760
Caption: it correctly with autonomous teams and

02:52:46.319 --> 02:52:48.959
Caption: everything else you don&#39;t generally have

02:52:47.759 --> 02:52:50.219
Caption: dependencies on other teams you have

02:52:48.959 --> 02:52:52.259
Caption: empowered teams you&#39;re able to take

02:52:50.219 --> 02:52:53.700
Caption: control of this for themselves

02:52:52.259 --> 02:52:55.978
Caption: um we all know that handoffs are where

02:52:53.700 --> 02:52:57.359
Caption: productivity goes to die

02:52:55.978 --> 02:52:59.519
Caption: um so you know

02:52:57.359 --> 02:53:01.560
Caption: generally if you find the empowered

02:52:59.519 --> 02:53:03.000
Caption: teams thing really hard to do no

02:53:01.559 --> 02:53:04.079
Caption: technology is going to save you you need

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:06.540
Caption: to revisit how you&#39;ve actually

02:53:04.080 --> 02:53:08.759
Caption: structured the organization

02:53:06.540 --> 02:53:10.859
Caption: um just one of those things

02:53:08.759 --> 02:53:12.179
Caption: so one of the common refrains and I even

02:53:10.859 --> 02:53:13.500
Caption: get this internally and I&#39;ve had this

02:53:12.179 --> 02:53:14.699
Caption: debate so many times it&#39;s one of the

02:53:13.500 --> 02:53:16.019
Caption: reasons for writing this talk because I

02:53:14.700 --> 02:53:17.879
Caption: got sick of writing the same thing in

02:53:16.019 --> 02:53:20.159
Caption: slack every week people always like oh

02:53:17.879 --> 02:53:21.540
Caption: but then I want to run a local test and

02:53:20.160 --> 02:53:22.919
Caption: oh it takes a while to stand up the

02:53:21.540 --> 02:53:25.379
Caption: infrastructure and I don&#39;t want to do

02:53:22.919 --> 02:53:27.179
Caption: that every time I run my tests I said

02:53:25.379 --> 02:53:28.379
Caption: who said that you&#39;re standing up the

02:53:27.179 --> 02:53:30.898
Caption: infrastructure every single time you run

02:53:28.379 --> 02:53:32.040
Caption: your test Suite that&#39;s that&#39;s insane why

02:53:30.899 --> 02:53:33.479
Caption: would you do that

02:53:32.040 --> 02:53:35.459
Caption: um this is just some python code that

02:53:33.478 --> 02:53:36.959
Caption: I&#39;ve used and I don&#39;t want to think how

02:53:35.459 --> 02:53:39.299
Caption: many repos now

02:53:36.959 --> 02:53:41.700
Caption: um that effectively just dump jumps in

02:53:39.299 --> 02:53:44.099
Caption: and runs terraform in it terraform

02:53:41.700 --> 02:53:46.500
Caption: um approve uh terraform apply and

02:53:44.099 --> 02:53:48.659
Caption: terraform destroy what you&#39;ll notice is

02:53:46.500 --> 02:53:50.099
Caption: there is a like environment variable

02:53:48.660 --> 02:53:52.080
Caption: escape hatch

02:53:50.099 --> 02:53:54.299
Caption: that if I set that environment to local

02:53:52.080 --> 02:53:55.620
Caption: I can just stand up the terraform once

02:53:54.299 --> 02:53:56.519
Caption: outside of my test suite and it&#39;ll be

02:53:55.620 --> 02:53:58.139
Caption: long-lived it&#39;s not going to get

02:53:56.519 --> 02:53:59.099
Caption: automatically torn down so I can lift

02:53:58.139 --> 02:54:00.478
Caption: stuff up for the whole day and then pull

02:53:59.099 --> 02:54:01.919
Caption: it down at the end of the day

02:54:00.478 --> 02:54:04.318
Caption: so then when I&#39;m actually running these

02:54:01.919 --> 02:54:06.120
Caption: tests my data layer and all that kind of

02:54:04.319 --> 02:54:07.680
Caption: stuff is long-lived so I&#39;m not having to

02:54:06.120 --> 02:54:08.939
Caption: wait every time for terraformal car

02:54:07.679 --> 02:54:12.120
Caption: information or what have you to do

02:54:08.939 --> 02:54:13.920
Caption: things instead for CI it defaults to

02:54:12.120 --> 02:54:15.540
Caption: running new stuff up and see how you

02:54:13.919 --> 02:54:18.059
Caption: want under 10 minutes like don&#39;t overly

02:54:15.540 --> 02:54:19.319
Caption: stress about like my CI job took more

02:54:18.059 --> 02:54:22.199
Caption: than two minutes now I&#39;m losing

02:54:19.319 --> 02:54:23.640
Caption: productivity it&#39;s not worth optimization

02:54:22.200 --> 02:54:25.140
Caption: kind of Beyond 10 that seems to be the

02:54:23.639 --> 02:54:26.818
Caption: general rule of thumb and generally with

02:54:25.139 --> 02:54:30.179
Caption: terraform and cloud formation most stuff

02:54:26.819 --> 02:54:33.260
Caption: you can rig up in two minutes and then

02:54:30.179 --> 02:54:33.259
Caption: have all your tests run on top

02:54:33.599 --> 02:54:37.199
Caption: um this was of an example that you know

02:54:35.939 --> 02:54:39.840
Caption: something I did for a client back in the

02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:41.459
Caption: UK with AWS config because some AWS

02:54:39.839 --> 02:54:42.779
Caption: stuff like Dynamo DBW you can build up

02:54:41.459 --> 02:54:44.639
Caption: it&#39;s yours you can deal with it

02:54:42.779 --> 02:54:45.839
Caption: something like AWS config and this is

02:54:44.639 --> 02:54:47.398
Caption: again kind of working at the platform

02:54:45.839 --> 02:54:49.318
Caption: level I was trying to build the Lambda

02:54:47.399 --> 02:54:51.300
Caption: function that aggregated certain config

02:54:49.319 --> 02:54:53.220
Caption: rules across the entire organization

02:54:51.299 --> 02:54:54.599
Caption: reported kind of a classification of

02:54:53.219 --> 02:54:57.540
Caption: resources

02:54:54.599 --> 02:54:58.978
Caption: now AWS config will give me different

02:54:57.540 --> 02:55:01.200
Caption: responses every single day because

02:54:58.978 --> 02:55:03.839
Caption: people change things and I can&#39;t control

02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:05.339
Caption: that I can&#39;t tell everyone no stop you

02:55:03.839 --> 02:55:06.660
Caption: can&#39;t deploy resources because I need to

02:55:05.339 --> 02:55:09.059
Caption: test my thing

02:55:06.660 --> 02:55:11.100
Caption: so this kind of comes from the react

02:55:09.059 --> 02:55:13.259
Caption: testing House of snapshot testing so

02:55:11.099 --> 02:55:15.839
Caption: people have done um unfortunately had to

02:55:13.259 --> 02:55:17.160
Caption: do front end work which I honestly hate

02:55:15.839 --> 02:55:19.318
Caption: um then you will come across snapshot

02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:20.640
Caption: testing in here within python there&#39;s a

02:55:19.319 --> 02:55:23.580
Caption: library called Placebo that allows you

02:55:20.639 --> 02:55:25.438
Caption: to effectively you call AWS once and it

02:55:23.580 --> 02:55:27.120
Caption: stores the response so next time you&#39;re

02:55:25.439 --> 02:55:28.439
Caption: on your test it replays that response

02:55:27.120 --> 02:55:30.719
Caption: back to you

02:55:28.439 --> 02:55:33.720
Caption: this is higher Fidelity than local stack

02:55:30.719 --> 02:55:35.700
Caption: because it&#39;s actually coming from AWS

02:55:33.719 --> 02:55:39.419
Caption: and it allows you to actually test

02:55:35.700 --> 02:55:42.779
Caption: things properly so I can you know verify

02:55:39.419 --> 02:55:44.160
Caption: that my function running actually does

02:55:42.779 --> 02:55:47.520
Caption: um

02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:49.439
Caption: it does give me the right responses and

02:55:47.519 --> 02:55:51.599
Caption: like has anyone ever configured local

02:55:49.439 --> 02:55:53.760
Caption: stack with the python helper because

02:55:51.599 --> 02:55:57.119
Caption: it&#39;s about five times more code than

02:55:53.759 --> 02:55:58.858
Caption: that just to make it work this is really

02:55:57.120 --> 02:56:00.120
Caption: really simple they get get committed to

02:55:58.859 --> 02:56:03.060
Caption: get everyone&#39;s working from the same

02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:04.859
Caption: thing really really simple to do if you

02:56:03.059 --> 02:56:06.540
Caption: can&#39;t um control if you can&#39;t

02:56:04.859 --> 02:56:08.279
Caption: orchestrate the dependency properly then

02:56:06.540 --> 02:56:09.719
Caption: you can just capture the responses you

02:56:08.279 --> 02:56:11.040
Caption: can refresh it occasionally but don&#39;t

02:56:09.719 --> 02:56:12.478
Caption: change your code and try and do the

02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:13.620
Caption: refresh at the same time it&#39;s one or the

02:56:12.478 --> 02:56:15.179
Caption: other

02:56:13.620 --> 02:56:17.339
Caption: um

02:56:15.179 --> 02:56:19.139
Caption: there are better things there are more

02:56:17.339 --> 02:56:22.139
Caption: Cloud native things there are things far

02:56:19.139 --> 02:56:23.580
Caption: more in line with what we want to do AWS

02:56:22.139 --> 02:56:25.879
Caption: themselves have released some accelerate

02:56:23.580 --> 02:56:29.219
Caption: serverless framework has a similar thing

02:56:25.879 --> 02:56:31.559
Caption: where instead as you make code changes

02:56:29.219 --> 02:56:33.478
Caption: they are live streamed in data s you get

02:56:31.559 --> 02:56:35.938
Caption: full Fidelity testing at speed and you

02:56:33.478 --> 02:56:38.519
Caption: get true Cloud native testing when you

02:56:35.939 --> 02:56:40.439
Caption: kind of get down to it and as you

02:56:38.519 --> 02:56:42.539
Caption: actually properly secure your Cloud

02:56:40.439 --> 02:56:45.300
Caption: environments and you actually have

02:56:42.540 --> 02:56:48.059
Caption: production like infrastructure running

02:56:45.299 --> 02:56:49.919
Caption: as you in the account will not allow you

02:56:48.059 --> 02:56:52.438
Caption: to test anymore

02:56:49.919 --> 02:56:54.599
Caption: because data should be locked away KMS

02:56:52.439 --> 02:56:56.520
Caption: Keys you should not have access I&#39;ll

02:56:54.599 --> 02:56:57.898
Caption: I&#39;ll make the point that generally most

02:56:56.519 --> 02:56:59.278
Caption: environments are not set up to this

02:56:57.899 --> 02:57:00.899
Caption: level but they should be

02:56:59.279 --> 02:57:02.220
Caption: but fundamentally you want to be

02:57:00.899 --> 02:57:04.080
Caption: actually assuming the principle of the

02:57:02.219 --> 02:57:05.160
Caption: Lambda function or equivalent when

02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:06.419
Caption: you&#39;re actually doing this testing

02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:08.160
Caption: because it actually tells you what&#39;s

02:57:06.419 --> 02:57:10.500
Caption: actually going to happen

02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:12.359
Caption: um you know you&#39;d actually if you try

02:57:10.500 --> 02:57:14.040
Caption: and do all this local SEC testing or

02:57:12.359 --> 02:57:17.399
Caption: even just testing locally against AWS

02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:19.500
Caption: apis or GPS apis or what have you

02:57:17.399 --> 02:57:22.620
Caption: if your security matures to a certain

02:57:19.500 --> 02:57:25.259
Caption: point it&#39;s all going to break

02:57:22.620 --> 02:57:26.399
Caption: um and it should break because the

02:57:25.259 --> 02:57:27.778
Caption: reality is you should be testing against

02:57:26.399 --> 02:57:29.399
Caption: production like infrastructure

02:57:27.779 --> 02:57:30.479
Caption: production like infrastructure shouldn&#39;t

02:57:29.399 --> 02:57:31.740
Caption: be allowing you to get into all the

02:57:30.478 --> 02:57:33.419
Caption: databases and pull stuff out as

02:57:31.740 --> 02:57:35.279
Caption: willy-nilly to check things have gone

02:57:33.419 --> 02:57:36.660
Caption: where they should go right

02:57:35.279 --> 02:57:38.939
Caption: um

02:57:36.660 --> 02:57:40.979
Caption: so coming back to this refinement piece

02:57:38.939 --> 02:57:43.319
Caption: I talked about before when you&#39;re

02:57:40.978 --> 02:57:45.000
Caption: testing this local stack you are testing

02:57:43.319 --> 02:57:46.379
Caption: how your system works in local stack and

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:48.240
Caption: you&#39;re bringing your mental model closer

02:57:46.379 --> 02:57:49.200
Caption: and closer in tune with that not

02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:51.540
Caption: actually with where it&#39;s actually

02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:53.580
Caption: running in production

02:57:51.540 --> 02:57:55.139
Caption: um for example on local stack face fixed

02:57:53.580 --> 02:57:58.200
Caption: this ages ago but when I was using it I

02:57:55.139 --> 02:58:00.419
Caption: found that the donor DB types were a lot

02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:01.979
Caption: looser so what was working in local

02:58:00.419 --> 02:58:05.160
Caption: stack when I went to AWS was being

02:58:01.978 --> 02:58:07.438
Caption: rejected by the API now you know

02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:10.319
Caption: that in and of itself maybe lost me 10

02:58:07.439 --> 02:58:11.819
Caption: minutes of time but 10 minutes of time

02:58:10.319 --> 02:58:13.379
Caption: multiplied by the amount of devs hitting

02:58:11.819 --> 02:58:14.760
Caption: all these random little edge cases and

02:58:13.379 --> 02:58:17.040
Caption: all those kind of things

02:58:14.759 --> 02:58:19.318
Caption: doesn&#39;t really work and also when you

02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:21.959
Caption: start to look at local stack yeah kind

02:58:19.319 --> 02:58:24.000
Caption: of the basics of that and

02:58:21.959 --> 02:58:25.859
Caption: um you&#39;ve got like the services enough

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:27.540
Caption: to wet like wet your whistle you can get

02:58:25.859 --> 02:58:29.939
Caption: in like okay lambda&#39;s there Dino&#39;s there

02:58:27.540 --> 02:58:31.979
Caption: cool I can start working now I want to

02:58:29.939 --> 02:58:33.120
Caption: kind of I have x-ray in there and I have

02:58:31.978 --> 02:58:36.358
Caption: a whole bunch of other things in here

02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:38.100
Caption: looks like cool payers no what this was

02:58:36.359 --> 02:58:39.300
Caption: all about saving costs against AWS what

02:58:38.099 --> 02:58:40.679
Caption: you tell me I now have to pay a license

02:58:39.299 --> 02:58:42.540
Caption: for every single developer are you

02:58:40.679 --> 02:58:45.478
Caption: insane and fundamentally these address

02:58:42.540 --> 02:58:47.459
Caption: costs are so minuscule like your local

02:58:45.478 --> 02:58:51.000
Caption: set cost is going to massively outweigh

02:58:47.459 --> 02:58:52.019
Caption: your Cloud Bill and this is insane

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.879
Caption: um

02:58:52.019 --> 02:58:56.818
Caption: it&#39;s kind of on the last

02:58:53.879 --> 02:58:59.160
Caption: the last kind of rant I&#39;m going to go on

02:58:56.819 --> 02:59:02.220
Caption: um again this is comes from people and

02:58:59.160 --> 02:59:03.719
Caption: it&#39;s not that these approaches were were

02:59:02.219 --> 02:59:04.919
Caption: wrong at the time they were came from a

02:59:03.719 --> 02:59:06.898
Caption: certain time certain place certain

02:59:04.919 --> 02:59:08.938
Caption: Paradigm and certain ways of working and

02:59:06.899 --> 02:59:10.500
Caption: they made a lot of sense

02:59:08.939 --> 02:59:12.120
Caption: um the point is that when you go to

02:59:10.500 --> 02:59:13.799
Caption: serverless that a lot of you need to

02:59:12.120 --> 02:59:16.020
Caption: reevaluate how you do things one of

02:59:13.799 --> 02:59:18.059
Caption: these things is I mean I&#39;ve

02:59:16.019 --> 02:59:20.519
Caption: hardly ever used a debugger I&#39;m really

02:59:18.059 --> 02:59:21.778
Caption: bad with them but you know a lot of the

02:59:20.519 --> 02:59:22.978
Caption: time people get used to being able to

02:59:21.779 --> 02:59:24.240
Caption: attach a debugger to their running code

02:59:22.978 --> 02:59:26.039
Caption: so they&#39;ve got the variables as they&#39;re

02:59:24.240 --> 02:59:27.660
Caption: going and all that kind of stuff

02:59:26.040 --> 02:59:29.160
Caption: and then they get to this point like how

02:59:27.660 --> 02:59:32.339
Caption: do I attach my debugger to the Lambda

02:59:29.160 --> 02:59:35.279
Caption: functions you can&#39;t you know people used

02:59:32.339 --> 02:59:36.839
Caption: to do what seems in retrospect insane

02:59:35.279 --> 02:59:38.279
Caption: where they&#39;d like go onto a production

02:59:36.839 --> 02:59:39.478
Caption: system attach a debugger to a running

02:59:38.279 --> 02:59:40.919
Caption: Java process to have a look at what&#39;s

02:59:39.478 --> 02:59:43.318
Caption: going on

02:59:40.919 --> 02:59:44.639
Caption: um you know in my mind that&#39;s insane but

02:59:43.319 --> 02:59:47.520
Caption: I can also understand why they did it at

02:59:44.639 --> 02:59:49.318
Caption: the time but nowadays you know that&#39;s

02:59:47.519 --> 02:59:51.179
Caption: not an option and you shouldn&#39;t be

02:59:49.319 --> 02:59:53.279
Caption: annoyed that&#39;s not an option but some

02:59:51.179 --> 02:59:56.160
Caption: people do get annoyed

02:59:53.279 --> 02:59:59.040
Caption: um you know this this is just apps a

02:59:56.160 --> 03:00:01.379
Caption: classic meme within the space right

02:59:59.040 --> 03:00:04.559
Caption: um the thing is it used to be loaded at

03:00:01.379 --> 03:00:06.540
Caption: as being ridiculous when in reality it&#39;s

03:00:04.559 --> 03:00:09.299
Caption: actually the case of how you should be

03:00:06.540 --> 03:00:10.740
Caption: doing things for a large part you know

03:00:09.299 --> 03:00:13.019
Caption: we always come out with the adage that

03:00:10.740 --> 03:00:14.939
Caption: you know code is read 10 more times than

03:00:13.019 --> 03:00:16.379
Caption: it&#39;s written the reality is it&#39;s run in

03:00:14.939 --> 03:00:18.240
Caption: production thousands and millions of

03:00:16.379 --> 03:00:20.160
Caption: times for every time it&#39;s written for

03:00:18.240 --> 03:00:24.180
Caption: any code that&#39;s doing a lot of stuff

03:00:20.160 --> 03:00:26.459
Caption: so really where you need to focus your

03:00:24.179 --> 03:00:28.978
Caption: efforts is in how do I understand when

03:00:26.459 --> 03:00:32.580
Caption: stuff breaks in production more so than

03:00:28.978 --> 03:00:35.339
Caption: how do I fix stuff locally

03:00:32.580 --> 03:00:36.540
Caption: one of the things that I do a lot with

03:00:35.339 --> 03:00:38.398
Caption: teams

03:00:36.540 --> 03:00:40.020
Caption: um is beginning with the end in mind and

03:00:38.399 --> 03:00:41.340
Caption: this is trying to bring SRE principles

03:00:40.019 --> 03:00:43.379
Caption: in just just kind of service all

03:00:41.339 --> 03:00:45.179
Caption: objectives not the other six

03:00:43.379 --> 03:00:46.799
Caption: um but just looking at how can I use

03:00:45.179 --> 03:00:48.239
Caption: Services objectives to Define what I&#39;m

03:00:46.799 --> 03:00:50.219
Caption: doing

03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:51.720
Caption: um you kind of got whenever you&#39;re kind

03:00:50.219 --> 03:00:52.978
Caption: of developing anything really and these

03:00:51.719 --> 03:00:55.200
Caption: are two questions that every single

03:00:52.978 --> 03:00:56.759
Caption: feature should be asked is how will I

03:00:55.200 --> 03:00:57.719
Caption: know my feature is broken and that gives

03:00:56.759 --> 03:00:59.580
Caption: you your like mean time to

03:00:57.719 --> 03:01:01.739
Caption: identification and how will I determine

03:00:59.580 --> 03:01:04.139
Caption: why it&#39;s broken which is my your mean

03:01:01.740 --> 03:01:06.120
Caption: time to recovery if

03:01:04.139 --> 03:01:07.559
Caption: on every like pull request review if

03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:08.879
Caption: you&#39;re not asking these questions you&#39;re

03:01:07.559 --> 03:01:10.919
Caption: going to end up pushing code which isn&#39;t

03:01:08.879 --> 03:01:13.139
Caption: operationally sound maybe functionally

03:01:10.919 --> 03:01:15.478
Caption: correct but when it blows up you&#39;re

03:01:13.139 --> 03:01:16.799
Caption: going to be really sorry at the end

03:01:15.478 --> 03:01:17.818
Caption: right

03:01:16.799 --> 03:01:19.500
Caption: um

03:01:17.819 --> 03:01:21.000
Caption: for me you should be looking at this one

03:01:19.500 --> 03:01:22.740
Caption: first

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:24.059
Caption: before you actually develop the feature

03:01:22.740 --> 03:01:24.959
Caption: you should be building the apparatus

03:01:24.059 --> 03:01:26.759
Caption: that allows you to understand your

03:01:24.959 --> 03:01:28.740
Caption: feature is broken

03:01:26.759 --> 03:01:30.898
Caption: and then second you can just type in why

03:01:28.740 --> 03:01:35.279
Caption: it&#39;s broken

03:01:30.899 --> 03:01:36.959
Caption: so SLI is slos slas I talk about these

03:01:35.279 --> 03:01:38.660
Caption: way too much but for anyone that&#39;s not

03:01:36.959 --> 03:01:41.279
Caption: not familiar

03:01:38.660 --> 03:01:42.839
Caption: service level SLI service indicators

03:01:41.279 --> 03:01:44.879
Caption: defines your success and failure so for

03:01:42.839 --> 03:01:47.099
Caption: the feature how can I measure that it

03:01:44.879 --> 03:01:48.959
Caption: was successful or failed in production

03:01:47.099 --> 03:01:50.938
Caption: what&#39;s actually look like

03:01:48.959 --> 03:01:52.799
Caption: service level objective then defines

03:01:50.939 --> 03:01:55.620
Caption: what an acceptable failure frequency is

03:01:52.799 --> 03:01:57.299
Caption: so you know for every thousand requests

03:01:55.620 --> 03:01:59.040
Caption: one&#39;s allowed to fail something like

03:01:57.299 --> 03:02:01.200
Caption: that expressed as percentages I&#39;m sure

03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:03.719
Caption: you&#39;ve kind of all seen slas floating

03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:05.520
Caption: around and then an SLA is a like

03:02:03.719 --> 03:02:06.778
Caption: contractual obligation defines a penalty

03:02:05.519 --> 03:02:09.599
Caption: for every time you actually fall

03:02:06.779 --> 03:02:11.220
Caption: underneath that failure goal

03:02:09.599 --> 03:02:12.719
Caption: um reality most systems you can just

03:02:11.219 --> 03:02:14.099
Caption: stop at slos especially for internal

03:02:12.719 --> 03:02:16.379
Caption: systems

03:02:14.099 --> 03:02:18.239
Caption: um one one thing I&#39;m going to get into

03:02:16.379 --> 03:02:21.358
Caption: here which is just something that always

03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:23.879
Caption: shits me is an SLO written in Confluence

03:02:21.359 --> 03:02:26.220
Caption: doesn&#39;t mean anything at all

03:02:23.879 --> 03:02:29.040
Caption: um I call them schroding as slos because

03:02:26.219 --> 03:02:31.080
Caption: no one knows whether it&#39;s alive or dead

03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:32.580
Caption: um I hate the I hate how often I see

03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:33.660
Caption: systems where people don&#39;t know where

03:02:32.580 --> 03:02:35.459
Caption: their system&#39;s alive or dead they&#39;re

03:02:33.660 --> 03:02:36.719
Caption: just kind of hoping it is

03:02:35.459 --> 03:02:38.160
Caption: um you know

03:02:36.719 --> 03:02:39.599
Caption: not going to say anything about putting

03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:40.500
Caption: them in a box with poison and waiting

03:02:39.599 --> 03:02:43.318
Caption: for a timer

03:02:40.500 --> 03:02:45.419
Caption: um one thing that we&#39;ve done and this is

03:02:43.319 --> 03:02:46.859
Caption: going open source this is not a sales

03:02:45.419 --> 03:02:49.080
Caption: pitch please don&#39;t take it as one

03:02:46.859 --> 03:02:52.080
Caption: whereas we built at container I built

03:02:49.080 --> 03:02:53.819
Caption: this for a client in the UK a um a way

03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:56.819
Caption: of dashboarding things in AWS that was

03:02:53.819 --> 03:02:59.939
Caption: SLO focused that we kept kind of it&#39;s

03:02:56.819 --> 03:03:02.520
Caption: all serverless all very extensible

03:02:59.939 --> 03:03:04.260
Caption: um but this you know when we on the team

03:03:02.519 --> 03:03:06.839
Caption: I built this with

03:03:04.259 --> 03:03:08.879
Caption: the first thing we did for every new

03:03:06.839 --> 03:03:10.740
Caption: feature was added to the SLO dashboard

03:03:08.879 --> 03:03:12.478
Caption: before we started working on the feature

03:03:10.740 --> 03:03:14.220
Caption: you can see some at the bottom around

03:03:12.478 --> 03:03:16.139
Caption: patching compliance testing and backups

03:03:14.219 --> 03:03:18.358
Caption: and stuff like that I built the backups

03:03:16.139 --> 03:03:19.559
Caption: was one I did just before I left where

03:03:18.359 --> 03:03:21.180
Caption: we were running out a new backup

03:03:19.559 --> 03:03:22.679
Caption: solution so the first thing I did was

03:03:21.179 --> 03:03:24.179
Caption: roll out and this was where the config

03:03:22.679 --> 03:03:25.679
Caption: bit came in as well the ability to

03:03:24.179 --> 03:03:27.299
Caption: understand how many instances are

03:03:25.679 --> 03:03:29.278
Caption: currently outside of backup plans how

03:03:27.299 --> 03:03:30.778
Caption: many don&#39;t have active backups with the

03:03:29.279 --> 03:03:32.640
Caption: idea that as I build the backup solution

03:03:30.779 --> 03:03:34.439
Caption: and roll it out and this is on a this is

03:03:32.639 --> 03:03:35.879
Caption: across 500 AWS accounts you can

03:03:34.439 --> 03:03:37.680
Caption: understand why I&#39;m trying to track these

03:03:35.879 --> 03:03:39.179
Caption: numbers because you can&#39;t possibly hold

03:03:37.679 --> 03:03:40.799
Caption: that in your head but I wanted to be

03:03:39.179 --> 03:03:42.239
Caption: able to show as we roll it out that

03:03:40.799 --> 03:03:44.040
Caption: these numbers going down

03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:45.779
Caption: because otherwise you&#39;re a backup

03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:47.700
Caption: solution and this is a classic thing we

03:03:45.779 --> 03:03:49.020
Caption: built the tool is anyone using the tool

03:03:47.700 --> 03:03:51.240
Caption: I don&#39;t know

03:03:49.019 --> 03:03:54.299
Caption: okay why do you build it

03:03:51.240 --> 03:03:55.560
Caption: and really fundamentally when you&#39;re

03:03:54.299 --> 03:03:57.120
Caption: doing this Cloud native development and

03:03:55.559 --> 03:03:59.459
Caption: talking about testing and getting into

03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:00.600
Caption: debugging you should be trying to debug

03:03:59.459 --> 03:04:01.740
Caption: your development with the same tools

03:04:00.599 --> 03:04:02.759
Caption: you&#39;re going to use to debug in

03:04:01.740 --> 03:04:04.259
Caption: production

03:04:02.759 --> 03:04:07.379
Caption: because otherwise and this is another

03:04:04.259 --> 03:04:09.660
Caption: rant of mine debug logs why do they

03:04:07.379 --> 03:04:11.639
Caption: exist why do they ever get committed to

03:04:09.660 --> 03:04:12.779
Caption: Mainline because you get them in

03:04:11.639 --> 03:04:14.519
Caption: production I&#39;ll be able to figure this

03:04:12.779 --> 03:04:16.319
Caption: out I&#39;ve had the debug logs

03:04:14.519 --> 03:04:18.719
Caption: great what are you going to do about it

03:04:16.319 --> 03:04:20.340
Caption: now if you if you wrote These logs to

03:04:18.719 --> 03:04:21.299
Caption: understand things in development you

03:04:20.339 --> 03:04:24.059
Caption: should be turning them on in production

03:04:21.299 --> 03:04:25.919
Caption: as well I I yeah it&#39;s just a rant of

03:04:24.059 --> 03:04:27.599
Caption: behind because again going back in time

03:04:25.919 --> 03:04:28.740
Caption: you used to be able to switch on debug

03:04:27.599 --> 03:04:30.119
Caption: logs by changing the environment

03:04:28.740 --> 03:04:31.740
Caption: variable or something like that you

03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:33.120
Caption: can&#39;t really do that anymore and even if

03:04:31.740 --> 03:04:35.220
Caption: you can like

03:04:33.120 --> 03:04:36.299
Caption: transient issues that you see that have

03:04:35.219 --> 03:04:38.459
Caption: disappeared and you really wish I had

03:04:36.299 --> 03:04:40.799
Caption: that log data oh it&#39;s gone oh well too

03:04:38.459 --> 03:04:42.059
Caption: bad right

03:04:40.799 --> 03:04:43.679
Caption: um really you get down to what you end

03:04:42.059 --> 03:04:45.719
Caption: up with you know be able to use X-ray

03:04:43.679 --> 03:04:47.459
Caption: and cloudwatch

03:04:45.719 --> 03:04:49.259
Caption: um you know grafana Prometheus all these

03:04:47.459 --> 03:04:51.419
Caption: kind of tools in production and you know

03:04:49.259 --> 03:04:53.879
Caption: Cloud operations suite and Azure logic

03:04:51.419 --> 03:04:55.679
Caption: monitor you know yeah you apply the

03:04:53.879 --> 03:04:56.759
Caption: tools synonyms for whatever Cloud you

03:04:55.679 --> 03:04:59.160
Caption: use

03:04:56.759 --> 03:05:00.478
Caption: um but really if you can&#39;t use these to

03:04:59.160 --> 03:05:01.919
Caption: figure out why your development&#39;s not

03:05:00.478 --> 03:05:04.500
Caption: working how are you going to use them to

03:05:01.919 --> 03:05:07.019
Caption: figure out a production is not working

03:05:04.500 --> 03:05:08.759
Caption: um you know debugger and local tools and

03:05:07.019 --> 03:05:10.679
Caption: that kind of stuff you&#39;re not going to

03:05:08.759 --> 03:05:12.240
Caption: have them when you really need them

03:05:10.679 --> 03:05:13.858
Caption: so why are you focused on becoming

03:05:12.240 --> 03:05:15.660
Caption: really strong with them

03:05:13.859 --> 03:05:17.100
Caption: like when you look at honeycomb and

03:05:15.660 --> 03:05:19.259
Caption: observability which I suggest everyone

03:05:17.099 --> 03:05:21.059
Caption: do you know they instrument everything

03:05:19.259 --> 03:05:23.099
Caption: and they use honeycomb for all their all

03:05:21.059 --> 03:05:25.139
Caption: their kind of needs it allows you to

03:05:23.099 --> 03:05:26.459
Caption: actually just yeah

03:05:25.139 --> 03:05:28.620
Caption: your code&#39;s going to be running in

03:05:26.459 --> 03:05:30.899
Caption: production for much longer than it takes

03:05:28.620 --> 03:05:32.819
Caption: you to write it you should be focusing

03:05:30.899 --> 03:05:33.899
Caption: on that

03:05:32.819 --> 03:05:34.979
Caption: um and when you get good with the

03:05:33.899 --> 03:05:36.959
Caption: production tools they&#39;re not going to

03:05:34.978 --> 03:05:39.119
Caption: slow down your development Cycles by

03:05:36.959 --> 03:05:41.399
Caption: using these things but it makes a lot

03:05:39.120 --> 03:05:42.660
Caption: more sense than trying to use a debugger

03:05:41.399 --> 03:05:44.459
Caption: locally and then getting stuck in

03:05:42.660 --> 03:05:46.319
Caption: production

03:05:44.459 --> 03:05:48.179
Caption: so I&#39;m actually running ahead of time

03:05:46.319 --> 03:05:49.859
Caption: which is nice unusual for me and I know

03:05:48.179 --> 03:05:51.959
Caption: I&#39;m keeping everyone from lunch so you

03:05:49.859 --> 03:05:53.939
Caption: know go figure I just wanted to kind of

03:05:51.959 --> 03:05:56.099
Caption: revisit back revisit back on the three

03:05:53.939 --> 03:05:57.420
Caption: key lessons the one testing query is

03:05:56.099 --> 03:05:59.339
Caption: anti-pattern there&#39;s the testing

03:05:57.419 --> 03:06:01.019
Caption: honeycomb that

03:05:59.339 --> 03:06:03.959
Caption: um Spotify have

03:06:01.019 --> 03:06:05.879
Caption: it&#39;s better I still think as an industry

03:06:03.959 --> 03:06:07.019
Caption: we can do better than that

03:06:05.879 --> 03:06:08.700
Caption: um emulating College the rest of your

03:06:07.019 --> 03:06:10.379
Caption: disappointment I hope any of you that

03:06:08.700 --> 03:06:11.459
Caption: are using local stack or equivalents

03:06:10.379 --> 03:06:13.679
Caption: today

03:06:11.459 --> 03:06:15.000
Caption: um maybe maybe I might get lucky and

03:06:13.679 --> 03:06:16.799
Caption: some of you might revisit that decision

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:18.478
Caption: next week I understand that it&#39;s

03:06:16.799 --> 03:06:19.740
Caption: investment and everything else and oh

03:06:18.478 --> 03:06:22.079
Caption: we&#39;re going to change the way we test

03:06:19.740 --> 03:06:22.979
Caption: makes our product owner cry

03:06:22.080 --> 03:06:25.139
Caption: um because they&#39;re not getting any

03:06:22.978 --> 03:06:27.239
Caption: features but you know you need that time

03:06:25.139 --> 03:06:28.438
Caption: to actually invest in you know paying

03:06:27.240 --> 03:06:29.459
Caption: down Tech debt and to be honest if

03:06:28.439 --> 03:06:32.220
Caption: you&#39;re using local stack I would

03:06:29.459 --> 03:06:33.419
Caption: classify that as technical debt nowadays

03:06:32.219 --> 03:06:35.580
Caption: um unless it&#39;s testing is a shopping

03:06:33.419 --> 03:06:37.679
Caption: code hits production you really like

03:06:35.580 --> 03:06:39.479
Caption: that&#39;s what you should be focusing for

03:06:37.679 --> 03:06:41.219
Caption: because that&#39;s where your code delivers

03:06:39.478 --> 03:06:43.978
Caption: value and where braking actually becomes

03:06:41.219 --> 03:06:46.620
Caption: a problem so yeah fundamentally look at

03:06:43.978 --> 03:06:48.179
Caption: what tools are in the cloud that you can

03:06:46.620 --> 03:06:50.580
Caption: use to understand your production code

03:06:48.179 --> 03:06:51.778
Caption: use those for your development code at

03:06:50.580 --> 03:06:54.719
Caption: the same time

03:06:51.779 --> 03:06:57.439
Caption: that that was all I had so hopefully

03:06:54.719 --> 03:06:57.438
Caption: there&#39;s some questions

03:07:03.779 --> 03:07:08.700
Caption: first of all Josh I love your brutally

03:07:06.959 --> 03:07:11.938
Caption: honest approach

03:07:08.700 --> 03:07:15.379
Caption: um it is fantastic it&#39;s very real I just

03:07:11.939 --> 03:07:15.380
Caption: wanted to throw that out there question

03:07:16.679 --> 03:07:22.679
Caption: oh sorry

03:07:18.500 --> 03:07:24.719
Caption: sorry yeah so um I guess if you need to

03:07:22.679 --> 03:07:25.919
Caption: keep CI tests fast

03:07:24.719 --> 03:07:27.839
Caption: um that requires that you&#39;re able to

03:07:25.919 --> 03:07:29.398
Caption: kind of spin up an ephemeral stack and

03:07:27.839 --> 03:07:32.279
Caption: then tear it down in a matter of minutes

03:07:29.399 --> 03:07:33.899
Caption: like what patterns

03:07:32.279 --> 03:07:35.419
Caption: um would you use when you have like a

03:07:33.899 --> 03:07:38.160
Caption: hybrid architecture where you kind of

03:07:35.419 --> 03:07:40.919
Caption: necessarily have one or two server full

03:07:38.160 --> 03:07:41.700
Caption: resources say AWS elasticsearch for

03:07:40.919 --> 03:07:43.559
Caption: example

03:07:41.700 --> 03:07:45.600
Caption: yeah at that point you&#39;ve got to make

03:07:43.559 --> 03:07:48.059
Caption: like a trade-off at some point for going

03:07:45.599 --> 03:07:49.978
Caption: well the cost of keeping it running

03:07:48.059 --> 03:07:51.419
Caption: versus the time saving you should be

03:07:49.978 --> 03:07:52.739
Caption: able to kind of when I come back to that

03:07:51.419 --> 03:07:54.299
Caption: kind of thousand dollars a day you can

03:07:52.740 --> 03:07:56.040
Caption: run the data and go it&#39;s going to be

03:07:54.299 --> 03:07:57.898
Caption: more effective to do it one way or the

03:07:56.040 --> 03:07:59.040
Caption: other but I think it would be try and

03:07:57.899 --> 03:08:00.420
Caption: get the data together to go running

03:07:59.040 --> 03:08:02.040
Caption: elasticsearch is going to cost us this

03:08:00.419 --> 03:08:04.859
Caption: much if we just leave it on

03:08:02.040 --> 03:08:07.859
Caption: okay well is that worth the speed up and

03:08:04.859 --> 03:08:09.120
Caption: development time for that like it comes

03:08:07.859 --> 03:08:10.140
Caption: down to you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got to make

03:08:09.120 --> 03:08:12.959
Caption: trade-offs you just want to make the

03:08:10.139 --> 03:08:15.059
Caption: cheapest trade-off whatever that is

03:08:12.959 --> 03:08:16.319
Caption: um but yeah elasticsearch is a pain and

03:08:15.059 --> 03:08:17.699
Caption: it&#39;s expensive as well so it&#39;s a hard

03:08:16.319 --> 03:08:19.859
Caption: one and in that case you might want to

03:08:17.700 --> 03:08:21.419
Caption: actually eat the CI rung or yeah

03:08:19.859 --> 03:08:22.859
Caption: generally have some kind of mocked

03:08:21.419 --> 03:08:24.419
Caption: version of elasticsearch I&#39;m not saying

03:08:22.859 --> 03:08:26.700
Caption: you can&#39;t Mock I&#39;m just saying don&#39;t

03:08:24.419 --> 03:08:27.419
Caption: default to it if it&#39;s going to be

03:08:26.700 --> 03:08:29.160
Caption: cheaper and you&#39;re going to get the

03:08:27.419 --> 03:08:30.839
Caption: Fidelity you want then Mark away but

03:08:29.160 --> 03:08:32.640
Caption: just it should be not the default

03:08:30.839 --> 03:08:33.959
Caption: position it should be yeah the other

03:08:32.639 --> 03:08:36.500
Caption: ones are too expensive we need to go

03:08:33.959 --> 03:08:36.500
Caption: down this path

03:08:37.339 --> 03:08:41.599
Caption: fantastic next one

03:08:43.799 --> 03:08:51.719
Caption: alrighty heckler&#39;s in the front audience

03:08:47.279 --> 03:08:54.359
Caption: now I am told you are here to Hackle so

03:08:51.719 --> 03:08:57.179
Caption: have we got any heckling

03:08:54.359 --> 03:08:59.580
Caption: no right all right so disappointing

03:08:57.179 --> 03:09:03.179
Caption: looks like uh I&#39;m gonna get all the

03:08:59.580 --> 03:09:05.399
Caption: books so uh joking seriously if we&#39;ve

03:09:03.179 --> 03:09:07.019
Caption: got any questions guys please put your

03:09:05.399 --> 03:09:10.399
Caption: hand up

03:09:07.019 --> 03:09:10.398
Caption: fantastic thank you

03:09:10.639 --> 03:09:18.179
Caption: what&#39;s your opinion on uh so Docker

03:09:14.639 --> 03:09:20.759
Caption: versus Lambda so you know running native

03:09:18.179 --> 03:09:22.799
Caption: Native lambdas versus running

03:09:20.759 --> 03:09:24.240
Caption: Docker containers or Docker serverless

03:09:22.799 --> 03:09:27.500
Caption: or

03:09:24.240 --> 03:09:27.500
Caption: um I mean with container

03:09:30.179 --> 03:09:33.898
Caption: yeah I like I like Dockers for I like

03:09:32.160 --> 03:09:35.219
Caption: Docker using Docker images Docker

03:09:33.899 --> 03:09:36.600
Caption: containers for local development to try

03:09:35.219 --> 03:09:38.339
Caption: and get some standardization on

03:09:36.599 --> 03:09:39.839
Caption: environments but if you&#39;re throwing them

03:09:38.339 --> 03:09:41.879
Caption: into production

03:09:39.839 --> 03:09:43.500
Caption: be aware that you&#39;re accepting a high

03:09:41.879 --> 03:09:45.779
Caption: level of accountability when it comes to

03:09:43.500 --> 03:09:47.700
Caption: your security posture in terms of

03:09:45.779 --> 03:09:49.020
Caption: managing the containers fixing

03:09:47.700 --> 03:09:51.120
Caption: vulnerabilities all that kind of stuff

03:09:49.019 --> 03:09:53.278
Caption: like you know when you&#39;re in a lamp when

03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:56.279
Caption: you&#39;re running Lambda without containers

03:09:53.279 --> 03:09:58.260
Caption: you know AWS fixed stuff for you

03:09:56.279 --> 03:09:59.399
Caption: underneath if you&#39;ve got a container

03:09:58.259 --> 03:10:00.540
Caption: strategy and everything else and you&#39;ve

03:09:59.399 --> 03:10:01.800
Caption: got all that kind of stuff in-house

03:10:00.540 --> 03:10:03.240
Caption: because maybe you&#39;ve got some kubernetes

03:10:01.799 --> 03:10:05.099
Caption: somewhere else and whatever and you can

03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:07.259
Caption: kind of piggyback on that but I still

03:10:05.099 --> 03:10:09.540
Caption: generally try and go with Native Lambda

03:10:07.259 --> 03:10:11.278
Caption: where possible because it&#39;s less work

03:10:09.540 --> 03:10:13.559
Caption: for me to do from a security perspective

03:10:11.279 --> 03:10:15.779
Caption: operationally it&#39;s not fantastically

03:10:13.559 --> 03:10:17.278
Caption: different but still dockier pulling

03:10:15.779 --> 03:10:20.419
Caption: extra packages that you have to rotate

03:10:17.279 --> 03:10:20.419
Caption: and fix the CVS for

03:10:20.939 --> 03:10:24.359
Caption: um I think Sheldon had one

03:10:22.978 --> 03:10:28.259
Caption: awesome

03:10:24.359 --> 03:10:30.240
Caption: one repo one function Primal and a mono

03:10:28.259 --> 03:10:32.740
Caption: repo mono repo

03:10:30.240 --> 03:10:33.979
Caption: what one

03:10:32.740 --> 03:10:37.379
Caption: [Laughter]

03:10:33.978 --> 03:10:38.938
Caption: one one Function One repo which my God

03:10:37.379 --> 03:10:41.519
Caption: you&#39;d hit you GitHub limits in about a

03:10:38.939 --> 03:10:43.740
Caption: week um but uh

03:10:41.519 --> 03:10:45.478
Caption: like

03:10:43.740 --> 03:10:49.379
Caption: I always think start with monorepo

03:10:45.478 --> 03:10:50.639
Caption: because it&#39;s easier and you can wait

03:10:49.379 --> 03:10:52.559
Caption: till you hit a scaling Point you&#39;re like

03:10:50.639 --> 03:10:54.239
Caption: actually multiple work for us like

03:10:52.559 --> 03:10:55.318
Caption: normally when I&#39;ve started a multi repo

03:10:54.240 --> 03:10:56.819
Caption: before and it&#39;s like okay well now we

03:10:55.319 --> 03:10:58.319
Caption: need to share this kind of package of

03:10:56.819 --> 03:11:00.540
Caption: types around between the repos now I&#39;ve

03:10:58.319 --> 03:11:02.040
Caption: got to figure all that out and it&#39;s like

03:11:00.540 --> 03:11:02.939
Caption: um now we&#39;ve got to push dependency yeah

03:11:02.040 --> 03:11:04.439
Caption: we&#39;ve got pull dependency version

03:11:02.939 --> 03:11:06.300
Caption: Independence he&#39;s like oh what&#39;s the

03:11:04.439 --> 03:11:08.279
Caption: value in doing this oh we have multiple

03:11:06.299 --> 03:11:10.379
Caption: repos yeah but what&#39;s the value multiple

03:11:08.279 --> 03:11:11.640
Caption: repos like if you&#39;re working in vertical

03:11:10.379 --> 03:11:12.719
Caption: slice and you have your code set up

03:11:11.639 --> 03:11:14.099
Caption: properly that you shouldn&#39;t be hitting

03:11:12.719 --> 03:11:15.778
Caption: like merge conflicts all the time or

03:11:14.099 --> 03:11:18.119
Caption: anything like that and at least it keeps

03:11:15.779 --> 03:11:19.200
Caption: your code more consistent more easily

03:11:18.120 --> 03:11:20.700
Caption: um I&#39;ve kind of gone back and forth on

03:11:19.200 --> 03:11:22.259
Caption: this over the years but at the moment I

03:11:20.700 --> 03:11:23.879
Caption: just go monore until I feel the pain

03:11:22.259 --> 03:11:26.219
Caption: especially if you do clean architecture

03:11:23.879 --> 03:11:27.660
Caption: like you end up with one code base that

03:11:26.219 --> 03:11:29.580
Caption: you kind of change the entry points for

03:11:27.660 --> 03:11:30.959
Caption: to do different Lambda functions so you

03:11:29.580 --> 03:11:32.219
Caption: end up with just kind of one blob of

03:11:30.959 --> 03:11:34.379
Caption: code that you deploy in different kind

03:11:32.219 --> 03:11:36.059
Caption: of configurations to do things

03:11:34.379 --> 03:11:38.040
Caption: um which is generally a lot easier from

03:11:36.059 --> 03:11:40.199
Caption: a packaging point of view it makes stuff

03:11:38.040 --> 03:11:42.839
Caption: a lot simpler

03:11:40.200 --> 03:11:44.879
Caption: well done because I didn&#39;t know what you

03:11:42.839 --> 03:11:47.040
Caption: were going to answer to my why because I

03:11:44.879 --> 03:11:49.978
Caption: am not sure what I&#39;m on Reaper is if I&#39;m

03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:52.879
Caption: honest guys so sorry for throwing you a

03:11:49.978 --> 03:11:52.879
Caption: little bit for success

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:04.740
Caption: have you applied these techniques in a

03:12:02.819 --> 03:12:07.919
Caption: kubernetes environment

03:12:04.740 --> 03:12:10.080
Caption: yeah I mean it&#39;s

03:12:07.919 --> 03:12:11.160
Caption: not fundamentally all that different it

03:12:10.080 --> 03:12:12.240
Caption: depends on how much managed Services

03:12:11.160 --> 03:12:13.859
Caption: you&#39;re running and all that kind of

03:12:12.240 --> 03:12:16.560
Caption: stuff but effectively I think the

03:12:13.859 --> 03:12:18.419
Caption: patterns still apply like when I um did

03:12:16.559 --> 03:12:19.919
Caption: some work for one of the mining

03:12:18.419 --> 03:12:21.240
Caption: companies in town a few years ago and we

03:12:19.919 --> 03:12:23.879
Caption: built it and we deployed it into Lambda

03:12:21.240 --> 03:12:25.020
Caption: and ECS from the same code base we just

03:12:23.879 --> 03:12:27.059
Caption: had to change stuff on the edge and it

03:12:25.019 --> 03:12:29.699
Caption: was the same approach for both

03:12:27.059 --> 03:12:31.379
Caption: um there&#39;s nothing like effectively your

03:12:29.700 --> 03:12:32.580
Caption: code to a larger we really shouldn&#39;t

03:12:31.379 --> 03:12:33.719
Caption: understand where the hell it&#39;s being

03:12:32.580 --> 03:12:34.859
Caption: deployed

03:12:33.719 --> 03:12:36.478
Caption: um and you should be trying to take

03:12:34.859 --> 03:12:38.459
Caption: those changes and push them right out to

03:12:36.478 --> 03:12:40.858
Caption: the far edge of your code again clean

03:12:38.459 --> 03:12:43.620
Caption: architecture helps a lot with this but

03:12:40.859 --> 03:12:45.240
Caption: yeah running in kubernetes or not the

03:12:43.620 --> 03:12:46.620
Caption: same principles I think still apply of

03:12:45.240 --> 03:12:48.540
Caption: just try and use the cloud as much as

03:12:46.620 --> 03:12:51.299
Caption: possible and stop trying to run like a

03:12:48.540 --> 03:12:53.399
Caption: postgres database locally or whatever

03:12:51.299 --> 03:12:54.660
Caption: um like you shouldn&#39;t need to I mean

03:12:53.399 --> 03:12:56.160
Caption: postgres is a little bit different

03:12:54.660 --> 03:12:58.200
Caption: because it&#39;s such a standard like stable

03:12:56.160 --> 03:13:00.660
Caption: platform that the emulation is generally

03:12:58.200 --> 03:13:03.359
Caption: very very high fidelity but still like

03:13:00.660 --> 03:13:04.679
Caption: you know try and figure out what you can

03:13:03.359 --> 03:13:07.140
Caption: do cheapest

03:13:04.679 --> 03:13:09.660
Caption: and generally developer time is the is

03:13:07.139 --> 03:13:10.739
Caption: the big one for cheap families don&#39;t I

03:13:09.660 --> 03:13:12.540
Caption: know sometimes you guys have different

03:13:10.740 --> 03:13:14.580
Caption: ideas on that but for most of us it&#39;s

03:13:12.540 --> 03:13:16.139
Caption: developer time you guys have scaled

03:13:14.580 --> 03:13:18.479
Caption: problems that all of us wish we had so

03:13:16.139 --> 03:13:21.000
Caption: it changes the needle sometimes

03:13:18.478 --> 03:13:25.459
Caption: alrighty we can probably fit one more

03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:25.459
Caption: question and if we have it

03:13:26.519 --> 03:13:29.119
Caption: thanks guys

03:13:30.299 --> 03:13:34.919
Caption: um do you kind of have any thoughts on

03:13:32.339 --> 03:13:36.419
Caption: what might be good kinds of production

03:13:34.919 --> 03:13:38.160
Caption: tests to do and maybe sort of

03:13:36.419 --> 03:13:39.478
Caption: organizational pushback on doing that

03:13:38.160 --> 03:13:41.219
Caption: kind of thing

03:13:39.478 --> 03:13:44.099
Caption: I mean yeah organizations really always

03:13:41.219 --> 03:13:45.660
Caption: push back on testing I think is that um

03:13:44.099 --> 03:13:47.099
Caption: I really like the service lab objective

03:13:45.660 --> 03:13:49.379
Caption: stuff I really like being able to

03:13:47.099 --> 03:13:51.179
Caption: understand

03:13:49.379 --> 03:13:52.080
Caption: Um how my feature is supposed to be

03:13:51.179 --> 03:13:54.299
Caption: working I&#39;m going to track how that

03:13:52.080 --> 03:13:55.740
Caption: feature is working and having just that

03:13:54.299 --> 03:13:57.120
Caption: really quick feedback I can see I&#39;m

03:13:55.740 --> 03:13:59.879
Caption: burning our budget so something&#39;s gone

03:13:57.120 --> 03:14:01.200
Caption: wrong I do think the SRE looking at SRE

03:13:59.879 --> 03:14:02.639
Caption: for how to run stuff in production is

03:14:01.200 --> 03:14:04.919
Caption: probably the way to go but I would say

03:14:02.639 --> 03:14:07.259
Caption: that&#39;s SRE as in like the Google Books

03:14:04.919 --> 03:14:09.059
Caption: not what a lot of vendors sell

03:14:07.259 --> 03:14:10.259
Caption: um today because I&#39;ve had so many

03:14:09.059 --> 03:14:12.299
Caption: arguments on redefining it at

03:14:10.259 --> 03:14:14.040
Caption: Enterprises where gsi&#39;s got him first

03:14:12.299 --> 03:14:16.139
Caption: and they&#39;re like oh and then there&#39;s a

03:14:14.040 --> 03:14:17.580
Caption: rebadged ITIL build and run that&#39;s not

03:14:16.139 --> 03:14:18.778
Caption: what SRE is

03:14:17.580 --> 03:14:20.399
Caption: um I think in production is pretty much

03:14:18.779 --> 03:14:22.200
Caption: like how do I know something&#39;s broken is

03:14:20.399 --> 03:14:24.479
Caption: is the big thing and service level

03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:26.700
Caption: objectives are probably the the kind of

03:14:24.478 --> 03:14:28.858
Caption: the becoming dominant way of doing that

03:14:26.700 --> 03:14:31.560
Caption: like there is the classic monitoring of

03:14:28.859 --> 03:14:35.040
Caption: my CPU is spiking send an alert and it&#39;s

03:14:31.559 --> 03:14:36.419
Caption: like no that&#39;s you need the kind of

03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:37.679
Caption: business impact level metrics to

03:14:36.419 --> 03:14:38.879
Caption: understand that customers are being

03:14:37.679 --> 03:14:41.398
Caption: impacted because you measure from the

03:14:38.879 --> 03:14:43.139
Caption: customer then CPU spiking useful

03:14:41.399 --> 03:14:44.880
Caption: diagnostic metric when you&#39;re in kind of

03:14:43.139 --> 03:14:46.199
Caption: debug mode but you shouldn&#39;t be alerting

03:14:44.879 --> 03:14:48.478
Caption: and actually be alerting on you know

03:14:46.200 --> 03:14:50.100
Caption: weighing so many 500 like 500 responses

03:14:48.478 --> 03:14:52.799
Caption: of spiking something&#39;s gone wrong on our

03:14:50.099 --> 03:14:55.199
Caption: API cool let&#39;s go and fix that

03:14:52.799 --> 03:14:57.240
Caption: um again observability in honeycomb is

03:14:55.200 --> 03:14:59.580
Caption: the big kind of I think it&#39;s the big

03:14:57.240 --> 03:15:00.779
Caption: paradigm shift that&#39;s coming

03:14:59.580 --> 03:15:02.580
Caption: um where you&#39;ve got like high

03:15:00.779 --> 03:15:03.779
Caption: cardinality events okay I definitely do

03:15:02.580 --> 03:15:05.219
Caption: not have time to get into that in any

03:15:03.779 --> 03:15:07.379
Caption: great detail but I can afterwards if

03:15:05.219 --> 03:15:11.398
Caption: you&#39;d like more than happy to

03:15:07.379 --> 03:15:14.519
Caption: 100 look guys that&#39;s probably time Josh

03:15:11.399 --> 03:15:17.540
Caption: but a big round of applause

03:15:14.519 --> 03:15:17.539
Caption: um that was Unreal

03:15:21.779 --> 03:15:27.959
Caption: now just a few friendly reminders lunch

03:15:25.439 --> 03:15:30.899
Caption: will be immediately served once you

03:15:27.959 --> 03:15:32.759
Caption: leave this store now you can go to the

03:15:30.899 --> 03:15:34.140
Caption: North or the South we

03:15:32.759 --> 03:15:35.759
Caption: we&#39;ve stuck over in front of the theater

03:15:34.139 --> 03:15:37.199
Caption: room there&#39;s going to be food sort of

03:15:35.759 --> 03:15:40.318
Caption: everywhere basically from what I&#39;m

03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:42.719
Caption: reading here uh lunchtime sessions will

03:15:40.319 --> 03:15:44.879
Caption: commence at 2 30

03:15:42.719 --> 03:15:48.599
Caption: 5 in the theater that&#39;s definitely a

03:15:44.879 --> 03:15:51.419
Caption: typo at 1 35 in the theater and both the

03:15:48.599 --> 03:15:53.519
Caption: river rooms notes do not do what I did

03:15:51.419 --> 03:15:56.279
Caption: before and eat your Apple because you

03:15:53.519 --> 03:15:58.438
Caption: will get in trouble in there

03:15:56.279 --> 03:16:00.899
Caption: um attendees there will also be breakout

03:15:58.439 --> 03:16:02.640
Caption: sessions that will commence again

03:16:00.899 --> 03:16:04.260
Caption: at

03:16:02.639 --> 03:16:07.679
Caption: 2 15.

03:16:04.259 --> 03:16:11.160
Caption: definitely 2 15 and I&#39;ve got one in here

03:16:07.679 --> 03:16:15.438
Caption: with a wonderful wonderful lady and she

03:16:11.160 --> 03:16:15.439
Caption: will be talking about standing on this

03:16:15.660 --> 03:16:21.660
Caption: standing on the shoulder of giants the

03:16:18.478 --> 03:16:24.419

Caption: all the job I went through that exercise

05:03:09.539 --> 05:03:14.158

05:03:12.240 --> 05:03:16.259
Caption: understand what it means and I was like

05:03:14.160 --> 05:03:17.878
Caption: hey Jason was right I didn&#39;t want to be

05:03:16.259 --> 05:03:20.699

05:03:17.878 --> 05:03:23.041
Caption: everybody at uwa said they want to be an

05:03:20.699 --> 05:03:25.738
Caption: I.T consultant all my peers say they

05:03:23.039 --> 05:03:27.957

05:03:27.957 --> 05:03:32.578
Caption: free from the traditional thinking right

05:03:29.878 --> 05:03:34.560
Caption: we wouldn&#39;t think for myself what we can

05:03:32.580 --> 05:03:37.439
Caption: learn or this deal from Jason&#39;s Story

05:03:34.560 --> 05:03:39.718
Caption: here is that you as a leader of today

05:03:37.439 --> 05:03:42.599
Caption: you have to challenge the initial belief

05:03:39.718 --> 05:03:44.160
Caption: of your Junior so you help them disrupt

05:03:42.599 --> 05:03:47.339
Caption: their traditional way of thinking that

05:03:44.160 --> 05:03:49.621
Caption: might not be true and then they can

05:03:47.339 --> 05:03:52.019
Caption: think for themselves or develop critical

05:03:49.619 --> 05:03:55.500
Caption: thinking skills now my next giant is

Caption: of course I know her name but anyways it

05:04:00.000 --> 05:04:05.580
Caption: was hard to get a job in Tech at first

05:04:02.400 --> 05:04:08.041
Caption: like in in Tech in Australia especially

05:04:05.580 --> 05:04:10.619
Caption: being an international student so kg

05:04:08.039 --> 05:04:13.796
Caption: helped me get my first job in Tech right

05:04:10.619 --> 05:04:16.199
Caption: she was so well connected she loved um

05:04:13.798 --> 05:04:19.080
Caption: connecting people together she pushed so

05:04:16.199 --> 05:04:21.539
Caption: hard to actually lend me the first job

05:04:19.080 --> 05:04:23.759
Caption: at the Cisco partner company

05:04:21.539 --> 05:04:26.339
Caption: I get to test what it&#39;s like to work in

05:04:23.759 --> 05:04:28.740
Caption: Tech right and that opportunity was so

05:04:26.339 --> 05:04:32.099
Caption: important to me to learn that hey

05:04:28.740 --> 05:04:35.041
Caption: employment was a two-way street

05:04:32.099 --> 05:04:37.740
Caption: as much as I want to be employed I also

05:04:35.039 --> 05:04:40.136
Caption: have to evaluate my employer value as

05:04:37.740 --> 05:04:43.500
Caption: well so I later left that partner

05:04:40.138 --> 05:04:47.400
Caption: company because I valued it online

05:04:43.500 --> 05:04:49.980
Caption: but what we can learn from kg here is

05:04:47.400 --> 05:04:52.259
Caption: leverage your extensive network to help

05:04:49.980 --> 05:04:55.019
Caption: your Junior land that opportunity to

05:04:52.259 --> 05:04:57.599
Caption: help your Junior get their first job or

05:04:55.019 --> 05:04:59.216
Caption: or wherever they want to go right if you

05:04:57.599 --> 05:05:01.019
Caption: know somebody that you can connect them

05:04:59.218 --> 05:05:02.339
Caption: with do that

05:05:01.019 --> 05:05:04.919

05:13:08.939 --> 05:13:13.740
Caption: we can learn from these two giants is

05:13:11.099 --> 05:13:15.539
Caption: that first you have to invest in the

05:13:13.740 --> 05:13:18.019

05:13:15.539 --> 05:13:21.238

05:13:18.019 --> 05:13:24.179

05:13:21.240 --> 05:13:26.041
Caption: for them in relation to the ability to

05:13:24.179 --> 05:13:27.419

05:13:26.039 --> 05:13:28.619

05:13:27.419 --> 05:13:31.320

05:14:26.699 --> 05:14:31.080

05:14:41.160 --> 05:14:44.699
Caption: confident in my technical skill than a

05:14:43.080 --> 05:14:47.638
Caption: year ago and that would not be possible

05:14:44.699 --> 05:14:50.759
