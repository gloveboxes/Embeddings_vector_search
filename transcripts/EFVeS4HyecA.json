  "description": "From chatbots to electric cars our world is becoming increasingly connected. You can turn your lights on or watch what is happening in private homes from across the globe right from your phone. Elevators make supposedly smart decisions about how best to deliver people to their floors and smart sensors tell us what speed the traffic should flow.\\n\\nWe all work on, in, or around technology every day of our lives. Despite our best intentions, we sometimes build systems with the potential for great harm. Visual recognition systems have mistaken a man for a monkey, a chemical plant that nearly levelled a community or a safety system that led to stalking.\\n\\nHow is it, the tiny little decisions we make every day can lead to some rather unpleasant outcomes? This talk will explore how our systems are designed, built, maintained, and decommissioned and what can go wrong when we don\u2019t consider where our decisions may lead. It poses some simple questions we can begin to ask ourselves, the companies we work for, and those we buy products from, in order to help us build a safer, fairer, and more equitable world; a world we all want to live in. \\n\\n--\\nFelicity began her career as a psychologist. Her PhD spanned psychology and genetics, where she explored what our genetic data can, or can\u2019t, tell us about our behaviour before she transitions into a career in technology. Felicity has worked in a variety of areas, from building chatbots for private companies to helping to improve cybersecurity in international governments. She holds a Masters Degree in Applied Cybernetics and some of her innovations have been personally lauded by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. She has a fascination with technology innovation and a passion for creating safer and more equitable technology.\\n\\nEditor note: Apologies for the slight audio stutter that appears, this was on the source file so I couldn\u0027t remove it \uD83D\uDE4F"
