WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.539
Caption: so today we have Brandon Lewis Here

00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:09.479
Caption: Brandon is going to talk to us about the

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:11.638
Caption: art of creative coding Brandon has been

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:14.518
Caption: developing software for about 20 years

00:00:11.638 --> 00:00:17.038
Caption: and is currently a senior manager of

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.618
Caption: software engineering at one of perth&#39;s

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:21.599
Caption: largest mutuals he&#39;s presented

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:25.920
Caption: previously at DDD

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.400
Caption: and his previous chat was around uses of

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.899
Caption: blockchain outside of cryptocurrency

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:36.020
Caption: today he&#39;ll be exploring the question

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:36.020
Caption: can code create up over to you

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:41.639
Caption: [Applause]

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:43.799
Caption: oh

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:45.299
Caption: thank you thanks very much

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:46.979
Caption: um wow it&#39;s a good turnout thank you

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:49.439
Caption: very much for for coming

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.878
Caption: um really appreciate you taking the time

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:52.799
Caption: uh before I start I just want to thank

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.239
Caption: the the sponsors for DDD Perth without

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.738
Caption: their generous support this event

00:00:54.238 --> 00:00:59.599
Caption: wouldn&#39;t be possible

00:00:55.738 --> 00:00:59.599
Caption: um so thank you very much for that

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.500
Caption: today what I really want to do is I I

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.319
Caption: have three objectives I&#39;m hoping to sort

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.119
Caption: of inspire all of you to to try your

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:11.879
Caption: hand at creative art or creative or

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.320
Caption: generative art and create code or create

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:14.938
Caption: art with code

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:16.919
Caption: I&#39;m going to show you some of the tools

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.840
Caption: that you might be able to use to do this

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:21.360
Caption: and some techniques some basic

00:01:18.839 --> 00:01:23.279
Caption: techniques to sort of get you started

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.040
Caption: what you shouldn&#39;t expect is a math

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:27.118
Caption: master class so while there are there

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.159
Caption: are some relationships between

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.100
Caption: mathematics and creative coding I&#39;m

00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:35.219
Caption: still very much a student of maths more

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:39.118
Caption: so than a teacher so so don&#39;t expect any

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.900
Caption: any math secrets to be honest

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.040
Caption: um

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.139
Caption: and web 3 and nfts big topics of course

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.180
Caption: don&#39;t expect to learn how to get rich or

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.860
Caption: Dogecoin or with Dogecoin selling

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.259
Caption: Profile Pics that&#39;s that&#39;s not what

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.759
Caption: we&#39;re here for

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.619
Caption: a bit about me

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.520
Caption: uh I&#39;ve been developing commercial

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.020
Caption: software for about 20 years I&#39;ve been

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:03.478
Caption: coding for closer to 30 at this point

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:05.039
Caption: I&#39;ve worked across the entire software

00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:06.959
Caption: stack from front-end to back end and

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.238
Caption: everything in between I specialized in

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.699
Caption: integration for many many years before

00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:14.520
Caption: moving into leadership roles and

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:16.319
Caption: proceeding with that my career

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.378
Caption: currently I&#39;m a software engineering

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.479
Caption: manager at a large wa based Mutual where

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:23.580
Caption: I lead a bunch of awesome people to do

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:25.259
Caption: cool stuff and I support them in being

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.779
Caption: awesome

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:29.939
Caption: uh you can find me on all of the various

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:32.220
Caption: twitters and linkedins and and whatnot

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.160
Caption: and I blog about leadership in my my

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.680
Caption: blog at leaderkaizen.com

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.059
Caption: uh of course I being a leader I don&#39;t

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.079
Caption: really code all those all that much

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.539
Caption: anymore

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.699
Caption: um in my work day to day so I have to

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:46.619
Caption: get my coding kicks elsewhere and to do

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:48.179
Caption: that I usually create my own projects

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.518
Caption: and work on things on the side in my

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:52.679
Caption: spare time

00:02:49.518 --> 00:02:54.660
Caption: that&#39;s sort of how I came to to get

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:57.539
Caption: involved with unity and and learn unity

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.720
Caption: and develop game prototypes with it I

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:02.159
Caption: really enjoy understanding how those

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.139
Caption: processes and Mechanics Work and seeing

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.958
Caption: if I can create them myself it&#39;s a good

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.958
Caption: learning experience and keeps my skills

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:13.139
Caption: um in current I suppose

00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:16.378
Caption: uh it&#39;s also how I got into to Skaters

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:18.598
Caption: so uh from from unity and learning uh

00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:20.339
Caption: mechanics and and developing those

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:22.800
Caption: things I got into Shader development

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:25.919
Caption: which is really another gateway to to

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.199
Caption: creative coding and how I got into that

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:30.779
Caption: some of the examples of shaders I&#39;ve

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:33.958
Caption: created uh are things like

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:35.580
Caption: from Mr shaders for lava obscuring or

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:39.000
Caption: objects that are obscured and doing

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.279
Caption: outlines and and mixing uh messing with

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.220
Caption: things like Z buffer and whatnot to fake

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:47.580
Caption: uh fake um transparency and the like and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.919
Caption: some Ripples and whatnot

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.738
Caption: but of course I haven&#39;t actually

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:55.619
Caption: finished a game and this tweet kind of

00:03:52.738 --> 00:03:59.419
Caption: explains why uh that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:59.419
Caption: that explains me really

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:02.699
Caption: but it turns out that my first

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.860
Caption: experience with creative coding was

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.720
Caption: actually many many years ago when I was

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.819
Caption: about nine years old

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.518
Caption: I joined a computer Club you know with

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.279
Caption: all the cool kids did right and got

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:16.199
Caption: introduced to logo uh in log with logo

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.699
Caption: you create you move a turtle around and

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.600
Caption: draw images on the screen and it&#39;s

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:24.779
Caption: actually used to to promote software

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.559
Caption: literacy and develop skills at a low

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:27.500
Caption: level

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:32.040
Caption: I didn&#39;t realize at the time of course

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.019
Caption: but it was um it was fun I suppose and

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.820
Caption: what I&#39;d like to actually do is maybe uh

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:37.079
Caption: maybe share

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.720
Caption: some of the things that you could do

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:41.879
Caption: with logo because uh

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.559
Caption: that&#39;s pretty cool

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.540
Caption: um of course being

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:48.720
Caption: this is a logo interpreter developed in

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.300
Caption: in JS and JavaScript available freely

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.299
Caption: and online I&#39;ll have links and resources

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:56.339
Caption: at the end of the attender presentation

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:58.500
Caption: but of course being nine this is kind of

00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:01.199
Caption: what I created right like

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.179
Caption: as you draw on a piece of paper

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.459
Caption: and of course when your skills are

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:08.220
Caption: limited uh and you don&#39;t really know

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:11.039
Caption: what you&#39;re doing you kind of just

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.660
Caption: chaos right just chaos

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.080
Caption: and just create all sorts of random

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.940
Caption: stuff that you think looks cool

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:19.439
Caption: but it wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t until recently

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.039
Caption: that I realized you could actually do

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.139
Caption: some pretty cool things like uh some

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.419
Caption: depictions of mathematical algorithms uh

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.059
Caption: in in logo itself and I I thought that

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.880
Caption: was pretty cool so this is a this is an

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:33.720
Caption: example of philotaxis which is a

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.600
Caption: um

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.579
Caption: it is the the way that leaves grow on

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.479
Caption: stems and plants so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:43.739
Caption: biology biology thing which is tied to a

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.380
Caption: mathematical can be represented

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:47.459
Caption: mathematically and thus depicted in in

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.660
Caption: code

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:50.660
Caption: and I thought that was pretty cool

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.960
Caption: see sorry

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:02.959
Caption: technical issues

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:08.419
Caption: yeah

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.419
Caption: real technical issues

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.919
Caption: cool

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.919
Caption: sorry

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:26.819
Caption: Technology&#39;s evolved obviously since

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:28.319
Caption: since logo and the ability to create to

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.259
Caption: create such stuff is is a lot more

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:32.100
Caption: accessible and a lot easier to do

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:33.660
Caption: particularly with things available on

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.940
Caption: the web like you just saw I could do

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.860
Caption: logo with through through a browser

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.419
Caption: which is really cool

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:42.599
Caption: uh but today I&#39;m going to be showing you

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:44.399
Caption: uh par P5 JS and Shader toy which are

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.380
Caption: two tools that create art in very

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:48.660
Caption: different ways and I&#39;m going to sort of

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.100
Caption: speak through how those differ but both

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.360
Caption: tools are web-based both are freely

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.919
Caption: available don&#39;t require any

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:54.239
Caption: subscriptions or any payments and you

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:55.380
Caption: don&#39;t even have to create an account on

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:57.179
Caption: any of the sites you can just kind of

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.059
Caption: use them

00:06:57.179 --> 00:07:02.160
Caption: there are there are comparisons that you

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:03.600
Caption: can draw between creative code or

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.539
Caption: creative or art to generated through

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.119
Caption: code and traditional art and I like to

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:10.440
Caption: view them as the programs that you use

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:12.660
Caption: or the apps that you use very much the

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.139
Caption: mediums much like canvases and stone and

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.759
Caption: wood where they determine largely the

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.199
Caption: thing you&#39;re going to create so you

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:21.239
Caption: don&#39;t you don&#39;t create a sculpture with

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:24.119
Caption: a canvas for example and you can sort of

00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:25.859
Caption: view tools in the same sort of vein and

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:28.019
Caption: then the algorithms and the the methods

00:07:25.859 --> 00:07:30.059
Caption: that you use to create these things the

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:32.160
Caption: code that you create that&#39;s your brushes

00:07:30.059 --> 00:07:33.359
Caption: and your pens and your chisels

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.098
Caption: uh

00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:38.939
Caption: and so I&#39;m going to talk through some of

00:07:35.098 --> 00:07:41.279
Caption: some of those today as we work through

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.979
Caption: some of the demos

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:45.598
Caption: um generative art is I think and I&#39;ll

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:47.519
Caption: sort of take a small tangent here and

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:50.759
Caption: speak of nfts like I wasn&#39;t going to do

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:54.299
Caption: but I generally think that gender of art

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:56.759
Caption: is a real genuine use case for nfts

00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:58.799
Caption: packaging the code along with the

00:07:56.759 --> 00:08:00.119
Caption: parameters to create the thing I think

00:07:58.799 --> 00:08:03.119
Caption: is

00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:05.039
Caption: is very valuable and I think is a real

00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:08.959
Caption: um there&#39;s a real benefit

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:08.959
Caption: and a genuine use case for nfts

00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:13.739
Caption: uh

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:15.179
Caption: processing with p5.js so p5.js is the

00:08:13.739 --> 00:08:17.759
Caption: first of the tools I want to speak to

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:19.440
Caption: you about today and it&#39;s it&#39;s based on

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:21.059
Caption: processing it&#39;s a flavor of processing

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.440
Caption: and processing was developed in I think

00:08:21.059 --> 00:08:24.720
Caption: 2001

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.839
Caption: as a

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:30.259
Caption: as a software literacy tool it&#39;s a it&#39;s

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:34.020
Caption: a Java based Graphics Library an IDE

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:37.020
Caption: that that you can draw stuff with it&#39;s

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.700
Caption: it is highly powerful and it&#39;s used for

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.559
Caption: things like simulations as well so it&#39;s

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.200
Caption: got a breadth everywhere from sort of

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:44.700
Caption: beginner level access to to very very

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.980
Caption: high level

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.018
Caption: the p5.js is a web implementation of

00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:50.458
Caption: that as the name suggests leveraging

00:08:49.018 --> 00:08:52.619
Caption: JavaScript

00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:54.000
Caption: it does have a web editor or you can

00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:56.159
Caption: build your own which I think is pretty

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.898
Caption: is pretty nifty

00:08:56.159 --> 00:09:00.359
Caption: um as I mentioned it&#39;s it&#39;s really easy

00:08:57.898 --> 00:09:03.059
Caption: to do it&#39;s really easy to get into and

00:09:00.359 --> 00:09:04.739
Caption: it&#39;s reasonably well documented uh you

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:06.599
Caption: can there are enough similarities while

00:09:04.739 --> 00:09:09.000
Caption: not a direct one-to-one Port of

00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:10.199
Caption: processing the the similarities are

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.200
Caption: close enough that you could actually

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.480
Caption: leverage the documentation in tandem

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.040
Caption: it is I consider sort of a high level

00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:19.018
Caption: language it abstracts a lot of the

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:21.719
Caption: difficulty and complexity in creating

00:09:19.018 --> 00:09:23.159
Caption: some of this stuff quite well so for

00:09:21.719 --> 00:09:25.079
Caption: example you can draw a circle you can

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:27.778
Caption: draw a square or if you&#39;re in 3D a cube

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.700
Caption: or a sphere and you&#39;d also use vectors

00:09:27.778 --> 00:09:32.700
Caption: and vectors is kind of we&#39;ll touch on

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:35.100
Caption: some of those but in a bit but having

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.958
Caption: that control really expands the

00:09:35.099 --> 00:09:39.000
Caption: possibilities that you have

00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.739
Caption: uh and it&#39;s a bit more like I say a bit

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.659
Caption: more high level than than shaders that

00:09:40.739 --> 00:09:46.500
Caption: we&#39;ll touch on a bit later

00:09:42.659 --> 00:09:47.518
Caption: you can like I say do 2D and 3D stuff uh

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.778
Caption: so

00:09:47.518 --> 00:09:51.679
Caption: um we&#39;ll we&#39;ll speak through some of

00:09:48.778 --> 00:09:51.679
Caption: those as well

00:09:51.719 --> 00:09:56.039
Caption: to give you an example

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:58.320
Caption: uh these are all created with p5.js so

00:09:56.039 --> 00:10:01.799
Caption: as you can see very different uh in

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.720
Caption: style very different in nature and

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:07.080
Caption: I could speak particularly for the for

00:10:03.719 --> 00:10:08.579
Caption: the um the one on the right that took a

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.019
Caption: lot of time and a lot of effort it&#39;s

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.600
Caption: really interesting how that came about

00:10:10.018 --> 00:10:14.820
Caption: and the author or the the artist

00:10:12.599 --> 00:10:16.739
Caption: um posts a really good blog post on that

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.820
Caption: which which I&#39;ll share in the slide deck

00:10:16.739 --> 00:10:19.440
Caption: as well

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.119
Caption: that they they talk about how they

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.799
Caption: actually created it and it&#39;s fascinating

00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:24.539
Caption: to see that actually

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:27.958
Caption: um come to life and come to fruition

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:29.278
Caption: long processed many months

00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.619
Caption: and of course you can create animations

00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:33.479
Caption: and I think that&#39;s

00:10:31.619 --> 00:10:35.940
Caption: um that&#39;s one of the the strongest draws

00:10:33.479 --> 00:10:37.380
Caption: of this in terms of uh in terms of

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.700
Caption: comparisons with traditional art and

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.220
Caption: it&#39;s something I think we as as

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.720
Caption: developers as coders have have an

00:10:41.219 --> 00:10:45.419
Caption: advantage and we can create some really

00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:49.099
Caption: cool animations um with with things like

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:49.099
Caption: p5.js and Shader toy

00:10:52.919 --> 00:11:01.159
Caption: so let&#39;s get on to some some demos right

00:10:57.419 --> 00:11:01.159
Caption: Sans the technical difficulties

00:11:04.739 --> 00:11:07.219
Caption: there we go

00:11:08.219 --> 00:11:11.819
Caption: can you close that one

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:13.320
Caption: so

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.179
Caption: p5.js

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.359
Caption: you can go to built-in editor

00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:20.159
Caption: uh like I said super super simple if you

00:11:18.359 --> 00:11:21.539
Caption: want to create a circle create a circle

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:24.119
Caption: and we&#39;ll do it in the middle of the

00:11:21.539 --> 00:11:26.039
Caption: screen so what&#39;s divided by two height

00:11:24.119 --> 00:11:27.659
Caption: divided by two if I could type that&#39;d be

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:30.778
Caption: great

00:11:27.659 --> 00:11:32.219
Caption: and 50. and it&#39;s a radius of 50 or

00:11:30.778 --> 00:11:35.940
Caption: diameter 50.

00:11:32.219 --> 00:11:37.679
Caption: any credit Circle super easy you change

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:41.760
Caption: the color of the circle so change the

00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:43.739
Caption: fill to I know uh red Maybe

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.700
Caption: because red

00:11:43.739 --> 00:11:46.380
Caption: yeah

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.660
Caption: yeah

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.419
Caption: red so

00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:52.799
Caption: super easy to use and I think that&#39;s one

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:55.139
Caption: of the biggest straws in terms of

00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:58.739
Caption: getting into it and just getting into

00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:01.079
Caption: creative art and trying to learn how to

00:11:58.739 --> 00:12:04.919
Caption: to think creatively rather than problem

00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:08.059
Caption: solve it&#39;s a really easy barrier really

00:12:04.919 --> 00:12:08.059
Caption: low barrier to entry

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.380
Caption: um

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:16.380
Caption: but you can also create things like this

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.760
Caption: right and

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.979
Caption: this is an example of something I

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:24.359
Caption: created with in collaboration with the

00:12:19.979 --> 00:12:26.699
Caption: guys at maker X when trying to I suppose

00:12:24.359 --> 00:12:28.760
Caption: defect or visualize earthquakes in an

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:32.160
Caption: interesting fashion

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.799
Caption: and we use kind of the number of circles

00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:38.099
Caption: that it would generate as as the the

00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:41.398
Caption: magnitudes would reflect those and then

00:12:38.099 --> 00:12:43.979
Caption: plot them randomly or into or perhaps in

00:12:41.398 --> 00:12:45.239
Caption: a geographical location and align that

00:12:43.979 --> 00:12:47.099
Caption: like that

00:12:45.239 --> 00:12:49.799
Caption: but what&#39;s really interesting is that

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:51.179
Caption: there aren&#39;t any circles here these are

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:53.838
Caption: actually created just by creating

00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:56.700
Caption: tangents tangents at regular intervals

00:12:53.838 --> 00:12:59.159
Caption: and drawing a line and this is I think

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.859
Caption: where the real power we start to see the

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:04.859
Caption: real power or something like p5.js where

00:13:01.859 --> 00:13:06.299
Caption: you can use vectors to to project these

00:13:04.859 --> 00:13:08.219
Caption: things which are much more difficult to

00:13:06.299 --> 00:13:10.919
Caption: do if you have to roll it yourself

00:13:08.219 --> 00:13:13.619
Caption: so what I actually do here is I take a

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:15.719
Caption: point in a circle I project a vector on

00:13:13.619 --> 00:13:17.458
Caption: One Direction added to the other side

00:13:15.719 --> 00:13:19.500
Caption: and then draw a line between the two and

00:13:17.458 --> 00:13:21.838
Caption: I just do that for everything for 360

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.940
Caption: times and it kind of draws a circle

00:13:21.838 --> 00:13:25.799
Caption: uh and I&#39;ll look through through one of

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.200
Caption: the circle so it&#39;s still relatively

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:30.859
Caption: simple to do I&#39;m not using any advanced

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.239
Caption: mathematics it&#39;s basic high school maths

00:13:30.859 --> 00:13:34.078
Caption: and it creates some really interesting

00:13:33.239 --> 00:13:36.119
Caption: stuff

00:13:34.078 --> 00:13:37.799
Caption: but of course you can just keep creating

00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:39.898
Caption: new versions

00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:42.479
Caption: over and over

00:13:39.898 --> 00:13:45.419
Caption: um or you could perhaps not even make it

00:13:42.479 --> 00:13:48.119
Caption: random and you could take the circle out

00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:50.159
Caption: and have it depicted elsewhere

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:53.278
Caption: the creative pot and this is where it

00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:54.359
Caption: gets super super interesting is uh you

00:13:53.278 --> 00:13:56.700
Caption: start off with something like this with

00:13:54.359 --> 00:13:58.739
Caption: a simple idea and then you try to expand

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.958
Caption: upon it and you could perhaps create

00:13:58.739 --> 00:14:04.018
Caption: something a bit more like this

00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:06.479
Caption: and this is completely different in many

00:14:04.018 --> 00:14:08.760
Caption: ways to to the other but the code is

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:12.059
Caption: almost identical so what I do here is

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:15.299
Caption: instead of creating uh line 360 lines to

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:16.380
Caption: create a circle make them random and I

00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:19.979
Caption: give them all different colors of

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:21.720
Caption: different points and just draw them draw

00:14:19.979 --> 00:14:24.440
Caption: a number of them and Vary the alpha

00:14:21.719 --> 00:14:26.879
Caption: randomly as well so you get the sort of

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.138
Caption: stringy sort of look

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.638
Caption: uh

00:14:28.138 --> 00:14:34.880
Caption: and of course oh if I was to remove the

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:34.880
Caption: seed

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.559
Caption: you can create and create

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.940
Caption: and create

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:43.739
Caption: all sorts of

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.898
Caption: different images and of course you can

00:14:43.739 --> 00:14:47.638
Caption: constrain them so uh there I&#39;m not

00:14:45.898 --> 00:14:49.859
Caption: really doing anything anything to limit

00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:51.778
Caption: where those things appear but you can

00:14:49.859 --> 00:14:56.239
Caption: you can sort of do that and we&#39;ll get to

00:14:51.778 --> 00:14:56.239
Caption: some examples that do that in a tick

00:14:57.299 --> 00:14:59.299
Caption: um

00:15:02.578 --> 00:15:06.239
Caption: but you can do something that&#39;s more

00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:08.760
Caption: structured perhaps and something that

00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:10.440
Caption: perhaps even mimics real life art so

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.220
Caption: like you&#39;re painting or something like

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.198
Caption: that

00:15:11.219 --> 00:15:16.138
Caption: and this is an example that I pulled

00:15:13.198 --> 00:15:19.799
Caption: together where I took a cityscape a city

00:15:16.138 --> 00:15:21.719
Caption: um City skyline as uh as

00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:24.958
Caption: um

00:15:21.719 --> 00:15:29.398
Caption: as inspiration and I wanted to I started

00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:32.479
Caption: off quite simply where I just had uh

00:15:29.398 --> 00:15:32.479
Caption: true false

00:15:35.578 --> 00:15:40.739
Caption: I thought about like that

00:15:38.239 --> 00:15:43.559
Caption: and one of the things I really wanted to

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:46.260
Caption: experiment with was layering layering on

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:49.138
Caption: top of it to create this perspective and

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:51.000
Caption: adjusting the alpha at various levels to

00:15:49.138 --> 00:15:52.559
Caption: to give that sort of perspective but

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.419
Caption: then of course that Evolution comes into

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:56.338
Caption: play and you&#39;re like well I wanted to

00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:58.859
Caption: try I want to try play with bezier

00:15:56.338 --> 00:16:01.799
Caption: curves or bezier Curves and so I added

00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:04.739
Caption: clouds as bezier curves bezier curves

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:06.119
Caption: again another example of how p5gs makes

00:16:04.739 --> 00:16:08.278
Caption: something that

00:16:06.119 --> 00:16:10.739
Caption: could be quite mathematically

00:16:08.278 --> 00:16:12.179
Caption: complex if you wanted it to be it

00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:14.398
Caption: doesn&#39;t have to be mind you but it can

00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:18.539
Caption: be and makes it really simple that&#39;s a

00:16:14.398 --> 00:16:20.039
Caption: simple simple function to create it uh

00:16:18.539 --> 00:16:22.578
Caption: yeah somewhere

00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:22.578
Caption: busier

00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:28.078
Caption: so I kind of create those but then I

00:16:25.979 --> 00:16:29.338
Caption: thought well what if I want to make it

00:16:28.078 --> 00:16:31.320
Caption: look like a paintbrush instead of

00:16:29.338 --> 00:16:33.599
Caption: something that&#39;s solid like that I mean

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.338
Caption: that that will look cool and stuff but I

00:16:33.599 --> 00:16:38.159
Caption: mean why not

00:16:35.338 --> 00:16:40.320
Caption: this takes a bit of a bit of time

00:16:38.159 --> 00:16:41.879
Caption: why not create to create a paintbrush

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.138
Caption: and the way I did that was now there

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.838
Caption: isn&#39;t a paintbrush you can&#39;t say hey

00:16:43.138 --> 00:16:47.638
Caption: p5.js draw me a paintbrush or Draw this

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:49.380
Caption: in a paintbrush stroke pattern

00:16:47.638 --> 00:16:51.778
Caption: um you have to create this manually and

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.820
Caption: that&#39;s just that&#39;s easy you take the

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:55.078
Caption: square and you PL take the pixels and

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.398
Caption: you just do one pixel at a time and

00:16:55.078 --> 00:17:00.239
Caption: that&#39;s sort of why it takes a bit a bit

00:16:56.398 --> 00:17:01.500
Caption: longer to do and we&#39;ll get into to how

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:03.059
Caption: this this is where one of the key

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.318
Caption: differentiates between this and Shader

00:17:03.059 --> 00:17:06.918
Caption: toy that we&#39;ll talk about later sort of

00:17:04.318 --> 00:17:06.918
Caption: comes into play

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.438
Caption: and then I thought well that doesn&#39;t

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.058
Caption: really look brush like right so you

00:17:10.438 --> 00:17:13.438
Caption: don&#39;t get the brush stroke at the end

00:17:12.058 --> 00:17:16.619
Caption: and I wanted to just get brush Strokes

00:17:13.438 --> 00:17:18.719
Caption: so I added I add a little Randomness to

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:20.818
Caption: the length of each stroke so each line

00:17:18.719 --> 00:17:23.280
Caption: is going up in a single pattern

00:17:20.818 --> 00:17:25.078
Caption: and I&#39;m just reduced just a minute or

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.838
Caption: randomizing the height of that line each

00:17:25.078 --> 00:17:30.178
Caption: time to create a sort of brush stroke

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:32.640
Caption: and the palettes I mean you might might

00:17:30.178 --> 00:17:34.140
Caption: have noticed that I have pallets for or

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.719
Caption: different palettes for everything and

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:39.178
Caption: that&#39;s just a list of of Json uh Json

00:17:36.719 --> 00:17:41.699
Caption: hex values and I&#39;ll load them in

00:17:39.178 --> 00:17:44.839
Caption: and then randomly pick one that&#39;s that&#39;s

00:17:41.699 --> 00:17:44.839
Caption: as simple as it gets really

00:17:48.538 --> 00:17:53.939
Caption: speaking of bezier Curves I think bezier

00:17:51.418 --> 00:17:56.880
Caption: curves are are a beautiful illustration

00:17:53.939 --> 00:17:59.519
Caption: of maths they

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.079
Caption: that they&#39;re really simple in in nature

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.260
Caption: but they can make some incredibly

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:06.538
Caption: interesting shapes and I sort of took

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.820
Caption: inspiration here from you know the world

00:18:06.538 --> 00:18:11.038
Caption: windows screen savers and sort of kind

00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:14.579
Caption: of bouncing around that was the

00:18:11.038 --> 00:18:16.139
Caption: inspiration right and and it&#39;s

00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:18.239
Caption: I haven&#39;t colored any of these and

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.739
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s I think the the next next

00:18:18.239 --> 00:18:20.880
Caption: phase is sort of what do you do with

00:18:19.739 --> 00:18:22.079
Caption: these to want to extend them so you take

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.039
Caption: something that&#39;s really simple in just

00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:28.880
Caption: 40 lines of code and you can create

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:31.319
Caption: all sorts of different shapes

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.298
Caption: and you start to want to create a bit

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:35.519
Caption: your creative part takes over and you&#39;re

00:18:33.298 --> 00:18:37.439
Caption: like well what can we do with that for

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.179
Caption: this particular instance I sort of took

00:18:37.439 --> 00:18:40.979
Caption: one bezier curve and then just linked it

00:18:39.178 --> 00:18:43.019
Caption: to another one but what if you made that

00:18:40.979 --> 00:18:45.178
Caption: random at some in some way or what if

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.940
Caption: you had that deterministic in some other

00:18:45.178 --> 00:18:49.380
Caption: fashion what if you added color what if

00:18:47.939 --> 00:18:51.959
Caption: you added different shading to the

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:55.339
Caption: different lines then you start to get

00:18:51.959 --> 00:18:55.339
Caption: some art right

00:18:57.058 --> 00:19:03.178
Caption: um a noise so uh

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.219
Caption: speaking of Randomness there is there is

00:19:03.178 --> 00:19:06.719
Caption: a lot of Randomness in Creative code and

00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:08.520
Caption: there&#39;s sorts of there&#39;s a few different

00:19:06.719 --> 00:19:10.319
Caption: ways you can approach that right and

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.479
Caption: there&#39;s you can have it as either

00:19:10.319 --> 00:19:14.459
Caption: completely random between two values and

00:19:12.479 --> 00:19:16.859
Caption: it&#39;ll pick something but sometimes you

00:19:14.459 --> 00:19:19.979
Caption: need something a bit more nuanced a bit

00:19:16.859 --> 00:19:21.479
Caption: a bit more subtle right and noise is a

00:19:19.979 --> 00:19:24.000
Caption: great way to do that something like

00:19:21.479 --> 00:19:27.538
Caption: purlin noise for example where it&#39;s a

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.520
Caption: gradient of of of Randomness it&#39;s

00:19:27.538 --> 00:19:30.538
Caption: something you can use in this in when

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.479
Caption: you want something like this where

00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:35.099
Caption: you&#39;re only incrementing a value by a

00:19:33.479 --> 00:19:37.079
Caption: small amount from the last value every

00:19:35.099 --> 00:19:39.418
Caption: time and you sort of iterate over that

00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:41.640
Caption: map of that purlin noise and adjust the

00:19:39.418 --> 00:19:43.979
Caption: value accordingly

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:47.940
Caption: very very powerful again something that

00:19:43.979 --> 00:19:47.939
Caption: is natively built into p5.js

00:19:51.418 --> 00:19:55.380
Caption: sorry uh speaking of rules I mentioned

00:19:53.579 --> 00:19:56.880
Caption: rules earlier where you want to sort of

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.500
Caption: constrain stuff and I suppose this is

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.260
Caption: more sort of software engineering

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.939
Caption: developery type of stuff

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.160
Caption: but you could constrain stuff like

00:20:02.939 --> 00:20:06.959
Caption: Circle packing and you could say well

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.880
Caption: don&#39;t have any circles over that don&#39;t

00:20:06.959 --> 00:20:11.520
Caption: create circles another Circle and create

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.359
Caption: some interesting diminishing patterns

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.739
Caption: um

00:20:12.359 --> 00:20:15.660
Caption: and you can then extend that again

00:20:13.739 --> 00:20:17.819
Caption: evolutionary well what can you do with

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.260
Caption: that perhaps you have that in certain

00:20:17.819 --> 00:20:21.058
Caption: shapes you could have that along a

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:23.459
Caption: bezier curve so you have a bezier curve

00:20:21.058 --> 00:20:25.798
Caption: and have the the circles all pack along

00:20:23.459 --> 00:20:27.779
Caption: that curve within a certain radius and

00:20:25.798 --> 00:20:30.678
Caption: create lines like that

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:33.119
Caption: or maybe you just want to represent

00:20:30.678 --> 00:20:35.219
Caption: represent Doge right

00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:37.199
Caption: because because why not

00:20:35.219 --> 00:20:40.260
Caption: and and this is a this is a really cool

00:20:37.199 --> 00:20:42.359
Caption: example of just taking an image sampling

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.579
Caption: the pixel of where your point is and

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:47.339
Caption: then making the color of that Circle

00:20:44.579 --> 00:20:49.140
Caption: that that pixel color and you can create

00:20:47.339 --> 00:20:50.880
Caption: something like this and of course you

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:53.099
Caption: can you can adjust all of all of the

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:55.558
Caption: values and you can have uh circles be

00:20:53.099 --> 00:20:57.119
Caption: bigger or smaller and you can I do have

00:20:55.558 --> 00:21:00.659
Caption: to make some changes to this to make the

00:20:57.119 --> 00:21:04.619
Caption: image a bit more legible because if you

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:06.179
Caption: have massive uh massive circles you then

00:21:04.619 --> 00:21:07.619
Caption: start to have huge Circles of one color

00:21:06.178 --> 00:21:09.000
Caption: and you can&#39;t really get that definition

00:21:07.619 --> 00:21:12.058
Caption: you don&#39;t really tell you not really

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.099
Caption: tell what it is so I had to implement

00:21:12.058 --> 00:21:16.260
Caption: something which would

00:21:14.099 --> 00:21:18.538
Caption: grow it and then slow it down as it got

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.760
Caption: bigger so as the circle got bigger I

00:21:18.538 --> 00:21:24.239
Caption: would slow the the growth down so that

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:26.339
Caption: it wouldn&#39;t really go past much a

00:21:24.239 --> 00:21:29.780
Caption: certain size and it would give time for

00:21:26.339 --> 00:21:29.779
Caption: more circles to fill in and pack it

00:21:29.819 --> 00:21:32.000
Caption: foreign

00:21:33.619 --> 00:21:38.038
Caption: taxes again so much like the logo

00:21:36.298 --> 00:21:39.918
Caption: example I shared earlier but this time

00:21:38.038 --> 00:21:43.500
Caption: with nice pretty colors

00:21:39.918 --> 00:21:45.899
Caption: and I wanted to show this purely because

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.058
Caption: I want to show that the maths around it

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.679
Caption: is super super simple

00:21:48.058 --> 00:21:51.119
Caption: and I think this is something which

00:21:49.678 --> 00:21:53.699
Caption: initially

00:21:51.119 --> 00:21:55.020
Caption: I found daunting when looking at

00:21:53.699 --> 00:21:56.219
Caption: creative code I would see all these

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.459
Caption: things on Twitter all these things on

00:21:56.219 --> 00:22:00.658
Caption: LinkedIn be like that looks really cool

00:21:58.459 --> 00:22:01.739
Caption: but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s really difficult to

00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:04.559
Caption: do

00:22:01.739 --> 00:22:06.119
Caption: and it&#39;s when you start to really dig

00:22:04.558 --> 00:22:08.099
Caption: into it and you you even just look up

00:22:06.119 --> 00:22:09.719
Caption: some you go into Wikipedia and you look

00:22:08.099 --> 00:22:11.339
Caption: up what some of these equations look

00:22:09.719 --> 00:22:12.298
Caption: like and they&#39;re not difficult but they

00:22:11.339 --> 00:22:14.158
Caption: can create some really really

00:22:12.298 --> 00:22:17.038
Caption: interesting patterns

00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:18.780
Caption: um taking that a step further

00:22:17.038 --> 00:22:20.519
Caption: and you can create

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:23.880
Caption: images like that that is the same

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:26.459
Caption: pattern just I&#39;m now adjusting the size

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.780
Caption: of each of the circles and I&#39;m coloring

00:22:26.459 --> 00:22:31.199
Caption: it a bit differently

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:34.580
Caption: that&#39;s really it&#39;s the same code just a

00:22:31.199 --> 00:22:34.579
Caption: bit different same thing a bit different

00:22:34.859 --> 00:22:38.939
Caption: thank you

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.579
Caption: but it doesn&#39;t have to be all geometric

00:22:38.939 --> 00:22:44.459
Caption: you can make stuff that&#39;s really random

00:22:41.579 --> 00:22:46.199
Caption: really interesting and almost paint like

00:22:44.459 --> 00:22:49.140
Caption: and this I sort of

00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:52.558
Caption: I tried to to

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:54.599
Caption: replicate or reproduce a Jackson Pollock

00:22:52.558 --> 00:22:57.479
Caption: painting So with lots of just sort of

00:22:54.599 --> 00:22:58.319
Caption: paint everywhere in arbitrary ways

00:22:57.479 --> 00:23:00.000
Caption: um

00:22:58.319 --> 00:23:02.759
Caption: and

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.280
Caption: this is sort of what it comes up with

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.839
Caption: but of course the benefit being code is

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:10.020
Caption: you can create

00:23:06.839 --> 00:23:11.279
Caption: as many as you want

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.659
Caption: and you can tell that they&#39;re all

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.159
Caption: slightly different in terms of brush

00:23:12.659 --> 00:23:15.900
Caption: sizes and that&#39;s all determined by the

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:18.960
Caption: code so I could submit it to certain

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:20.359
Caption: brush sizes or brushes or I could make

00:23:18.959 --> 00:23:23.158
Caption: it go wild

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:24.719
Caption: patterns and and you can introduce

00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:27.000
Caption: patterns to it and there&#39;s a really

00:23:24.719 --> 00:23:30.119
Caption: interesting article I read about taking

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.619
Caption: an image and using the values of those

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:34.678
Caption: images the color values of those images

00:23:31.619 --> 00:23:36.538
Caption: to manipulate how the lines are drawn so

00:23:34.678 --> 00:23:38.459
Caption: you end up having something that looks

00:23:36.538 --> 00:23:39.658
Caption: like this but it has structure within it

00:23:38.459 --> 00:23:42.199
Caption: I thought that was really really

00:23:39.659 --> 00:23:42.200
Caption: interesting

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.080
Caption: um

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:52.439
Caption: but this is the this is really the uh

00:23:49.859 --> 00:23:53.880
Caption: this particular example is the the

00:23:52.439 --> 00:23:55.859
Caption: technique I really wanted to go in depth

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.298
Caption: with a bit more because you sort of look

00:23:55.859 --> 00:24:00.058
Caption: at it and you can&#39;t it might be

00:23:57.298 --> 00:24:01.500
Caption: difficult to see what&#39;s going on how you

00:24:00.058 --> 00:24:03.298
Caption: create that

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:06.538
Caption: but when I found out how to create this

00:24:03.298 --> 00:24:09.298
Caption: I was amazed how easy it actually was uh

00:24:06.538 --> 00:24:11.219
Caption: and it&#39;s all very very logical and it&#39;s

00:24:09.298 --> 00:24:13.500
Caption: easy to demonstrate as well

00:24:11.219 --> 00:24:15.538
Caption: so you take a look at something like

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:18.719
Caption: this and

00:24:15.538 --> 00:24:21.538
Caption: all it is is it&#39;s a it&#39;s a flow field

00:24:18.719 --> 00:24:23.038
Caption: but it&#39;s created with vectors which I

00:24:21.538 --> 00:24:25.979
Caption: mentioned earlier which again benefit of

00:24:23.038 --> 00:24:27.899
Caption: p5.js

00:24:25.979 --> 00:24:30.000
Caption: but that&#39;s what it looks like

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.460
Caption: so you take you take a grid you take a

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.839
Caption: canvas you plot it into grids and you

00:24:32.459 --> 00:24:34.880
Caption: can adjust the size of the grid as much

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:37.739
Caption: as you want

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.640
Caption: you then plot some purlin noise over

00:24:37.739 --> 00:24:40.678
Caption: that

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.020
Caption: and then take vectors based on that

00:24:40.678 --> 00:24:46.918
Caption: purlin noise so if your noise is zero to

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:48.719
Caption: one and you relate that to a radius or a

00:24:46.918 --> 00:24:50.699
Caption: um to a Direction

00:24:48.719 --> 00:24:52.619
Caption: you then direct the vector in that way

00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:55.199
Caption: and because Pearl and noise is

00:24:52.619 --> 00:24:56.579
Caption: Progressive uh it&#39;s it&#39;s you start to

00:24:55.199 --> 00:24:59.399
Caption: get the sort of

00:24:56.579 --> 00:25:00.959
Caption: feel this this motion as you will so

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.000
Caption: it&#39;s sort of like forces being applied

00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:06.058
Caption: and all of the all of the directions

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.619
Caption: that you see here are just are the

00:25:06.058 --> 00:25:09.779
Caption: directions of the flow field influenced

00:25:07.619 --> 00:25:11.819
Caption: by purlin noise

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.700
Caption: and you can create of course I think

00:25:11.819 --> 00:25:17.418
Caption: I&#39;ve got this randomized I think maybe

00:25:14.699 --> 00:25:17.418
Caption: possibly

00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:25.459
Caption: I do like that seed

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.500
Caption: oh

00:25:30.538 --> 00:25:33.500
Caption: is it going to create the same one

00:25:33.659 --> 00:25:37.500
Caption: yeah but I can take a better seat how&#39;s

00:25:36.178 --> 00:25:39.658
Caption: that

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.159
Caption: perhaps

00:25:39.659 --> 00:25:43.140
Caption: I mean you could put an any seed really

00:25:41.159 --> 00:25:44.820
Caption: now I will I will confess there is a bit

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.200
Caption: of a bug in it and you&#39;ll see

00:25:44.819 --> 00:25:47.759
Caption: occasionally you can see it here where

00:25:46.199 --> 00:25:49.918
Caption: on the edges it sort of gets trapped

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.178
Caption: between two so again you get to you have

00:25:49.918 --> 00:25:54.119
Caption: to do some problem solving as an

00:25:51.178 --> 00:25:55.619
Caption: engineer and figure out well how do you

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:58.558
Caption: make

00:25:55.619 --> 00:26:00.178
Caption: how do you adjust the the force or the

00:25:58.558 --> 00:26:01.619
Caption: direction of those so that you don&#39;t end

00:26:00.178 --> 00:26:02.699
Caption: up having these infinite loops on either

00:26:01.619 --> 00:26:04.020
Caption: side

00:26:02.699 --> 00:26:06.298
Caption: but of course it can be adjusted even

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.400
Caption: further so if you wanted to for example

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:09.959
Caption: uh have it go longer so right now I&#39;m

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.760
Caption: constraining the time so it only has a

00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:13.619
Caption: certain amount of time to create

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.199
Caption: and it&#39;s it&#39;s that&#39;s probably something

00:26:13.619 --> 00:26:17.760
Caption: I should have called out it&#39;s the alpha

00:26:16.199 --> 00:26:19.380
Caption: that makes it do that so it&#39;s like

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.320
Caption: putting a whole bunch of pixels on the

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:25.079
Caption: onto the screen and then adjusting the

00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:26.158
Caption: alpha gradually over time as you as you

00:26:25.079 --> 00:26:27.719
Caption: throw in more pixels and those pixels

00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:30.059
Caption: kind of travel around and as they leave

00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:31.439
Caption: more Trails you start to get thicker

00:26:30.058 --> 00:26:33.418
Caption: thicker lines in the areas that they

00:26:31.439 --> 00:26:35.879
Caption: travel

00:26:33.418 --> 00:26:37.859
Caption: um but it&#39;s the vector at the heart of

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:40.199
Caption: it it&#39;s the vectors that really that

00:26:37.859 --> 00:26:43.079
Caption: really help to make this possible

00:26:40.199 --> 00:26:45.658
Caption: but again super super easy right there

00:26:43.079 --> 00:26:46.979
Caption: is nothing that should stop anyone uh

00:26:45.659 --> 00:26:48.659
Caption: even someone with very limited

00:26:46.979 --> 00:26:52.199
Caption: development experience or programming

00:26:48.659 --> 00:26:55.080
Caption: experience to do this sort of stuff

00:26:52.199 --> 00:26:57.439
Caption: so it highly highly recommend people try

00:26:55.079 --> 00:26:57.439
Caption: it out

00:26:57.599 --> 00:27:00.079
Caption: cool

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.099
Caption: and then

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.380
Caption: no

00:27:06.178 --> 00:27:10.158
Caption: yes

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:13.319
Caption: cool so uh

00:27:10.159 --> 00:27:15.240
Caption: p5.js in summary is a is a fantastic

00:27:13.319 --> 00:27:16.439
Caption: tool for pretty much anyone to get into

00:27:15.239 --> 00:27:19.859
Caption: creative code

00:27:16.439 --> 00:27:22.019
Caption: it&#39;s easy to uh it&#39;s easy to get into

00:27:19.859 --> 00:27:24.359
Caption: it&#39;s well well documented

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.679
Caption: but it&#39;s also a really good tool for

00:27:24.359 --> 00:27:27.000
Caption: anyone with

00:27:25.678 --> 00:27:28.918
Caption: um with develop with Advanced

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.178
Caption: programming experience and the reason I

00:27:28.918 --> 00:27:33.119
Caption: say that

00:27:30.178 --> 00:27:34.979
Caption: is because I&#39;ve only just scratched the

00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:36.658
Caption: surface there is a breadth of of

00:27:34.979 --> 00:27:38.760
Caption: capability there which you can leverage

00:27:36.659 --> 00:27:41.279
Caption: I didn&#39;t even touch on the 3D stuff that

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:43.440
Caption: you can do but you can do 3D and it does

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:46.140
Caption: support shaders for example and you can

00:27:43.439 --> 00:27:48.658
Caption: hook it up to all sorts of other sources

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:51.419
Caption: and it&#39;s fantastic for kids

00:27:48.659 --> 00:27:53.279
Caption: um it if Loya was what we were taught

00:27:51.418 --> 00:27:55.259
Caption: sort of 30 years ago

00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:57.000
Caption: um this is is what kids should be taught

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.140
Caption: now in live view

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Caption: uh

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:05.239
Caption: extra benefit the skills are

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.239
Caption: transferable so JS you can transfer that

00:28:06.538 --> 00:28:10.939
Caption: shaders uh

00:28:08.819 --> 00:28:13.859
Caption: shaders with Shader toy

00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:16.439
Caption: so as I mentioned earlier I got into

00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:19.319
Caption: unity and that introduced me to shaders

00:28:16.439 --> 00:28:20.639
Caption: and shaders are a sea like see like-ish

00:28:19.319 --> 00:28:24.359
Caption: language

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:26.940
Caption: um user C like C like language like J

00:28:24.359 --> 00:28:29.219
Caption: um glsl and hlsl

00:28:26.939 --> 00:28:31.798
Caption: they are they are high level languages

00:28:29.219 --> 00:28:35.880
Caption: but I would liken them to lower level

00:28:31.798 --> 00:28:39.239
Caption: languages than say um p5.js in that they

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:42.900
Caption: are assembly like it&#39;s not assembly by

00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:44.880
Caption: any means but you you the way you have

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.440
Caption: to think about working with them is very

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.760
Caption: much assembly like

00:28:46.439 --> 00:28:51.418
Caption: they&#39;re used in the graphics render

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:54.178
Caption: pipeline for 3D stuff and useful things

00:28:51.418 --> 00:28:56.719
Caption: like lighting Shadows uh Reflections all

00:28:54.178 --> 00:28:56.719
Caption: that kind of thing

00:28:57.298 --> 00:29:00.599
Caption: um

00:28:58.079 --> 00:29:03.298
Caption: uh there are several different types of

00:29:00.599 --> 00:29:04.859
Caption: shaders by the way so vertex shaders

00:29:03.298 --> 00:29:06.359
Caption: geometry shaders and fragment shaders

00:29:04.859 --> 00:29:08.339
Caption: they all do different things we&#39;re going

00:29:06.359 --> 00:29:10.140
Caption: to focus primarily on fragment shaders

00:29:08.339 --> 00:29:12.178
Caption: today

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.320
Caption: and what&#39;s really interesting is these

00:29:12.178 --> 00:29:15.719
Caption: are some examples that were created

00:29:13.319 --> 00:29:17.519
Caption: there isn&#39;t any 3D geometry in there

00:29:15.719 --> 00:29:20.219
Caption: there are no triangles there are no

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.500
Caption: meshes there are no no quads no vertices

00:29:20.219 --> 00:29:25.619
Caption: whatsoever that&#39;s all drawn effectively

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:28.558
Caption: drawn to the screen and a call out to

00:29:25.619 --> 00:29:31.500
Caption: inio kiles who did the rainforest he&#39;s

00:29:28.558 --> 00:29:32.520
Caption: got a fantastic YouTube video on how we

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.699
Caption: made that

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:39.080
Caption: absolutely worth a watch

00:29:35.699 --> 00:29:39.079
Caption: and we&#39;ll get on to some more demos

00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:53.339
Caption: before I get too far and I just want to

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:57.359
Caption: give a quick a quick sort of uh

00:29:53.339 --> 00:29:59.398
Caption: Shakedown of what what shaders are in a

00:29:57.359 --> 00:30:01.079
Caption: typical 3D environment you have a mesh

00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:04.559
Caption: that&#39;s made up of vertices and some

00:30:01.079 --> 00:30:07.019
Caption: lines between them creating triangles

00:30:04.558 --> 00:30:08.699
Caption: then you can apply a material to it but

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:10.739
Caption: of course the material doesn&#39;t have any

00:30:08.699 --> 00:30:12.839
Caption: value until you apply some light to it

00:30:10.739 --> 00:30:15.000
Caption: so you get some light and you get a

00:30:12.839 --> 00:30:18.178
Caption: material you can then also provide some

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.678
Caption: directional lighting and some shading on

00:30:18.178 --> 00:30:22.380
Caption: the material

00:30:19.678 --> 00:30:25.019
Caption: it&#39;s all of them all of the material

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:26.940
Caption: stuff is is the shadery bits is that

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.839
Caption: we&#39;re going to be talking about so we&#39;re

00:30:26.939 --> 00:30:29.278
Caption: not going to worry about the vertices

00:30:27.839 --> 00:30:31.558
Caption: today we&#39;re just going to be talking

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:33.179
Caption: about the shaders

00:30:31.558 --> 00:30:36.079
Caption: sorry about the the

00:30:33.178 --> 00:30:36.079
Caption: um the fragment Shader

00:30:36.418 --> 00:30:40.199
Caption: uh I&#39;m going to skip these examples

00:30:38.459 --> 00:30:42.778
Caption: because we&#39;re running low on time but

00:30:40.199 --> 00:30:43.678
Caption: head over to Shader toy to check those

00:30:42.779 --> 00:30:45.600
Caption: out because they&#39;re really really

00:30:43.678 --> 00:30:47.760
Caption: interesting

00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:50.819
Caption: um but the thing I really wanted to uh

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:52.260
Caption: the the method or or the technique I

00:30:50.819 --> 00:30:54.418
Caption: wanted to share with you with regards to

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:57.599
Caption: shaders is Ray marching that is how

00:30:54.418 --> 00:31:00.898
Caption: those images were done and it&#39;s a really

00:30:57.599 --> 00:31:02.880
Caption: interesting technique to apply to um to

00:31:00.899 --> 00:31:04.440
Caption: creative coding in general and it&#39;s you

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.839
Caption: can use that to create proper scenes or

00:31:04.439 --> 00:31:09.479
Caption: you can create it create fractals and

00:31:06.839 --> 00:31:12.000
Caption: all sorts of interesting stuff with them

00:31:09.479 --> 00:31:14.398
Caption: and the whole notion of it is

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.918
Caption: um effectively looking at looking at a

00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:19.799
Caption: scene and measuring the distance between

00:31:16.918 --> 00:31:22.380
Caption: the camera and something in the scene

00:31:19.798 --> 00:31:25.798
Caption: figuring out what&#39;s closer and rendering

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:28.260
Caption: that and you render it pixel by pixel

00:31:25.798 --> 00:31:30.658
Caption: I think that&#39;s that&#39;s the key thing to

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:32.579
Caption: to bear in mind with shaders is you are

00:31:30.659 --> 00:31:35.159
Caption: not actually saying hey draw me a circle

00:31:32.579 --> 00:31:37.260
Caption: draw me a square draw me a cube you are

00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:40.740
Caption: saying I want this color at this color

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:43.320
Caption: pixel at coordinate X Y to be this color

00:31:40.739 --> 00:31:46.140
Caption: uh and that is all very mathematically

00:31:43.319 --> 00:31:47.398
Caption: or can be very mathematically intensive

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.419
Caption: um so it&#39;s a bit more daunting to get

00:31:47.399 --> 00:31:49.440
Caption: into and we&#39;ll get into that a little

00:31:48.418 --> 00:31:52.739
Caption: bit

00:31:49.439 --> 00:31:54.298
Caption: um but Ray marching is a process of

00:31:52.739 --> 00:31:56.640
Caption: um determining the distance between

00:31:54.298 --> 00:31:58.319
Caption: objects in the scene and your camera

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.178
Caption: so I created this little sort of demo

00:31:58.319 --> 00:32:02.639
Caption: thing to sort of show how that might

00:32:00.178 --> 00:32:05.939
Caption: work and I&#39;m going to turn off all those

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.558
Caption: so say you started off with uh so you

00:32:05.939 --> 00:32:08.579
Caption: started off with your camera in the

00:32:07.558 --> 00:32:10.380
Caption: middle of the scene

00:32:08.579 --> 00:32:11.459
Caption: and we have array that&#39;s going out from

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.079
Caption: the scene

00:32:11.459 --> 00:32:15.239
Caption: now so you add some objects into the

00:32:13.079 --> 00:32:16.798
Caption: scene right

00:32:15.239 --> 00:32:18.959
Caption: you want to you want to try and figure

00:32:16.798 --> 00:32:20.819
Caption: out which so if I&#39;m looking in this

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:22.678
Caption: direction what am I supposed to render

00:32:20.819 --> 00:32:25.979
Caption: to the screen I&#39;m supposed to render

00:32:22.678 --> 00:32:28.519
Caption: number one at this particular pixel

00:32:25.979 --> 00:32:28.520
Caption: so

00:32:29.159 --> 00:32:33.840
Caption: how do we do that well we draw lines we

00:32:31.918 --> 00:32:36.658
Caption: try to we go through we Loop through the

00:32:33.839 --> 00:32:38.479
Caption: entire entire scene and say well how far

00:32:36.659 --> 00:32:40.919
Caption: are you how far are you how far are you

00:32:38.479 --> 00:32:42.479
Caption: and you try to draw the close but you

00:32:40.918 --> 00:32:43.918
Caption: don&#39;t want to draw it to the to the

00:32:42.479 --> 00:32:45.839
Caption: origin of that you want to draw it to

00:32:43.918 --> 00:32:46.979
Caption: the origin of the surface of that and

00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:49.319
Caption: that&#39;s where stuff gets interesting

00:32:46.979 --> 00:32:53.219
Caption: because that uses sine distance fields

00:32:49.319 --> 00:32:55.439
Caption: to calculate where the surface of it is

00:32:53.219 --> 00:32:56.819
Caption: based on what the center or the origin

00:32:55.439 --> 00:32:59.939
Caption: is of that object

00:32:56.819 --> 00:33:02.119
Caption: and you do that iteratively so you take

00:32:59.939 --> 00:33:06.239
Caption: further and further steps as you get out

00:33:02.119 --> 00:33:08.399
Caption: into the into the scene to figure out

00:33:06.239 --> 00:33:10.140
Caption: when you&#39;ve hit something so as you can

00:33:08.399 --> 00:33:11.580
Caption: see here I haven&#39;t actually hit anything

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.839
Caption: because I haven&#39;t reached my minimum

00:33:11.579 --> 00:33:14.819
Caption: distance

00:33:12.839 --> 00:33:16.018
Caption: that I to get to the object I haven&#39;t

00:33:14.819 --> 00:33:17.398
Caption: realized that hey I&#39;m actually at a

00:33:16.019 --> 00:33:19.559
Caption: surface

00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:21.119
Caption: but if you extend that further you start

00:33:19.558 --> 00:33:22.439
Caption: to see it

00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:24.058
Caption: expand

00:33:22.439 --> 00:33:26.219
Caption: and you can see where you&#39;re starting to

00:33:24.058 --> 00:33:30.119
Caption: actually hit things

00:33:26.219 --> 00:33:32.158
Caption: um and you return that back to your uh

00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:34.380
Caption: back to your code and you say I&#39;m going

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:35.940
Caption: to display pixel of this color at this

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.979
Caption: coordinate

00:33:35.939 --> 00:33:40.439
Caption: so in a nutshell that is that is

00:33:37.979 --> 00:33:42.778
Caption: remarking and that&#39;s used through

00:33:40.439 --> 00:33:45.500
Caption: each of through the rest of these these

00:33:42.779 --> 00:33:45.500
Caption: um these examples

00:33:45.739 --> 00:33:54.359
Caption: I created a basic bootstrap Ray marching

00:33:50.579 --> 00:33:56.278
Caption: Shader which will be in in in the

00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:59.640
Caption: resources at the end of the slideshow

00:33:56.279 --> 00:34:03.240
Caption: uh but essentially all it is is a basic

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:06.359
Caption: uh algorithm to do ray marching and the

00:34:03.239 --> 00:34:08.459
Caption: magic here all happens if they forget

00:34:06.359 --> 00:34:10.858
Caption: the normal calculating

00:34:08.459 --> 00:34:14.699
Caption: um happens sort of here

00:34:10.858 --> 00:34:17.219
Caption: and for this example the

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:18.959
Caption: the distance for a sphere

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:21.060
Caption: if you want to calculate the science

00:34:18.959 --> 00:34:23.878
Caption: distance field for the sphere is

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:25.560
Caption: calculated with this right now the

00:34:23.878 --> 00:34:27.898
Caption: benefit is you don&#39;t have to worry about

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.760
Caption: having to work all this out some some

00:34:27.898 --> 00:34:31.799
Caption: very smart people have already worked

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.560
Caption: out the sign distance fields for almost

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.239
Caption: every shape you can think of you then

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.520
Caption: take those and combine them and you

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:40.378
Caption: combine them using Boolean operators so

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:43.439
Caption: you can Union them you can subtract them

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:45.959
Caption: you can multiply them or add them

00:34:43.439 --> 00:34:49.678
Caption: and that&#39;s that&#39;s effectively how you

00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:52.378
Caption: would create a scene and for example

00:34:49.678 --> 00:34:54.178
Caption: I created this for DDD Perth

00:34:52.378 --> 00:34:55.799
Caption: where

00:34:54.178 --> 00:34:57.659
Caption: it&#39;s just some lights going around but

00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:00.719
Caption: there is no geometry in the scene right

00:34:57.659 --> 00:35:02.399
Caption: this is all just I&#39;m picking a pixel uh

00:35:00.719 --> 00:35:04.500
Caption: in a screen based on this distance for

00:35:02.399 --> 00:35:07.139
Caption: something and I can even show you what

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:09.780
Caption: that might look like if you take the the

00:35:07.139 --> 00:35:11.879
Caption: O here for example

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.560
Caption: and this is when demo Gods strike me

00:35:11.879 --> 00:35:16.979
Caption: down

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:19.739
Caption: uh so if I was to just return say

00:35:16.979 --> 00:35:22.760
Caption: um the main o right so I&#39;m returning the

00:35:19.739 --> 00:35:22.760
Caption: distance to the main o

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.900
Caption: so yeah there we go and let&#39;s get a

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.719
Caption: sphere because that&#39;s all I started off

00:35:27.899 --> 00:35:33.299
Caption: with but then what if I what if I

00:35:30.719 --> 00:35:35.159
Caption: returned the minimum no actually I don&#39;t

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:37.920
Caption: think I&#39;d do the maximum work

00:35:35.159 --> 00:35:43.639
Caption: uh for the maximum value

00:35:37.919 --> 00:35:43.639
Caption: of the main o and say the whole right

00:35:44.699 --> 00:35:49.699
Caption: oh

00:35:46.199 --> 00:35:49.699
Caption: Oh wrong one my bad

00:35:50.399 --> 00:35:55.260
Caption: hold on let demo God strike me down

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.520
Caption: there we go

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.880
Caption: so what I&#39;ve done here is I&#39;ve

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.199
Caption: effectively negated uh the the main o so

00:35:59.879 --> 00:36:05.039
Caption: the main o is no longer visible and only

00:36:01.199 --> 00:36:07.199
Caption: the D&#39;s within it are right

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.520
Caption: but you can create a mask actually if I

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:10.379
Caption: do mask

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:13.040
Caption: that might

00:36:10.379 --> 00:36:13.039
Caption: oops

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:18.060
Caption: this is why you don&#39;t do live coding

00:36:16.858 --> 00:36:18.719
Caption: people

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.280
Caption: um

00:36:18.719 --> 00:36:21.659
Caption: so

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.839
Caption: by doing this what I&#39;ve done is I&#39;ve

00:36:21.659 --> 00:36:27.000
Caption: I&#39;ve created a an intersection between

00:36:23.839 --> 00:36:28.320
Caption: the O and the mask that I&#39;ve got for the

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.879
Caption: circle in the middle

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:32.459
Caption: and that&#39;s how you would you would

00:36:29.879 --> 00:36:34.379
Caption: create a scene based out of

00:36:32.459 --> 00:36:37.260
Caption: uh these Primitives that you would

00:36:34.379 --> 00:36:39.719
Caption: create with sign distance fields

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.219
Caption: and it when you sort of when you start

00:36:39.719 --> 00:36:43.500
Caption: to look at that you start to really

00:36:41.219 --> 00:36:46.500
Caption: appreciate what some of these more

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.760
Caption: complex or complex images really take to

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.118
Caption: to create

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:53.820
Caption: it&#39;s a far more

00:36:51.118 --> 00:36:55.939
Caption: I appreciate that experience a whole lot

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.940
Caption: more

00:36:57.839 --> 00:37:01.619
Caption: of course the benefit is you can do

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.300
Caption: stuff like this as well

00:37:01.618 --> 00:37:05.459
Caption: if you were to try and create this sort

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:08.520
Caption: of thing with a with traditional sort of

00:37:05.459 --> 00:37:09.780
Caption: 3D geometry uh your machine would be on

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.599
Caption: fire

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:15.119
Caption: um and and so but you can you can do

00:37:12.599 --> 00:37:17.040
Caption: this because you can do this in shaders

00:37:15.118 --> 00:37:18.719
Caption: because you&#39;re not affecting you&#39;re not

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.820
Caption: affecting geometry you are effectively

00:37:18.719 --> 00:37:22.800
Caption: changing the shape of the environment

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.660
Caption: you&#39;re affecting the environment not the

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.679
Caption: geometry itself so this is this this

00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:27.899
Caption: whole

00:37:25.679 --> 00:37:30.358
Caption: um field of spheres is created just by

00:37:27.899 --> 00:37:33.000
Caption: by applying a modulo

00:37:30.358 --> 00:37:36.319
Caption: to the sphere and it creates all of

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.320
Caption: these all these spheres

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:40.979
Caption: the the intersections or the uh The

00:37:39.239 --> 00:37:41.879
Caption: Operators that I mentioned earlier and

00:37:40.979 --> 00:37:43.739
Caption: because you&#39;re using sine distance

00:37:41.879 --> 00:37:46.259
Caption: Fields allow you to do cool stuff like

00:37:43.739 --> 00:37:47.939
Caption: if this this thing is close to this

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.439
Caption: thing take us point in this point and if

00:37:47.939 --> 00:37:51.060
Caption: it&#39;s close enough together do something

00:37:49.439 --> 00:37:53.578
Caption: with it that&#39;s how you sort of get this

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:55.739
Caption: uh this glob effect

00:37:53.579 --> 00:37:57.300
Caption: um I I&#39;m really Keen to try and make

00:37:55.739 --> 00:37:58.919
Caption: this into sort of a metabols type of

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.339
Caption: thing or like a lava lamp I think that&#39;d

00:37:58.919 --> 00:38:01.338
Caption: be pretty cool

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:05.219
Caption: um

00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:06.598
Caption: but you don&#39;t have to just do you don&#39;t

00:38:05.219 --> 00:38:09.598
Caption: have to just do

00:38:06.599 --> 00:38:12.320
Caption: sort of shapes and stuff again another

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:12.320
Caption: mathematical

00:38:12.659 --> 00:38:17.578
Caption: Ingenuity or another mathematical

00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:19.380
Caption: principle the mandelbrot set

00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:21.599
Caption: and it&#39;s a depiction of it just zooming

00:38:19.379 --> 00:38:25.439
Caption: in and it&#39;s

00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:25.440
Caption: constantly evolving

00:38:25.739 --> 00:38:29.699
Caption: and shaders are really good at doing

00:38:26.939 --> 00:38:31.800
Caption: this because it you get to Leverage The

00:38:29.699 --> 00:38:33.540
Caption: GPU to process and crunch some of these

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.219
Caption: things which is really effective and you

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.739
Caption: get to do some cool stuff with distances

00:38:35.219 --> 00:38:40.020
Caption: from from various places

00:38:37.739 --> 00:38:43.760
Caption: so all those are all those available on

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:43.760
Caption: Shader toy to take a look at

00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:53.899
Caption: nope

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.939
Caption: so that did it work did it work no

00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:06.839
Caption: it is changing here like it&#39;s changed

00:39:04.739 --> 00:39:07.800
Caption: it&#39;s kind of semi-changing there but I

00:39:06.839 --> 00:39:11.160
Caption: don&#39;t know

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.479
Caption: I don&#39;t know man this is

00:39:11.159 --> 00:39:14.098
Caption: he just goes to show you no matter how

00:39:12.479 --> 00:39:15.540
Caption: much you prepare tell you what

00:39:14.099 --> 00:39:16.940
Caption: just

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:21.079
Caption: that uh

00:39:16.939 --> 00:39:21.078
Caption: do that and go back

00:39:21.239 --> 00:39:27.959
Caption: oh maybe I&#39;ve just got to do that

00:39:25.079 --> 00:39:29.520
Caption: no it&#39;s just not moving at all

00:39:27.959 --> 00:39:31.760
Caption: like a moving slides here but it&#39;s not

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.760
Caption: moving

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:37.940
Caption: nope

00:39:40.919 --> 00:39:49.280
Caption: oh there we go that&#39;ll do it

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:49.280
Caption: uh all that five uh five okay

00:39:51.179 --> 00:39:57.598
Caption: yay there you go so uh sorry about that

00:39:55.339 --> 00:39:58.920
Caption: Shader toy requires a shift in mindset

00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:00.780
Caption: and I think that&#39;s the key takeaway for

00:39:58.919 --> 00:40:02.299
Caption: Shader toy in particular it&#39;s definitely

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:05.880
Caption: not as approachable as something like

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:09.719
Caption: php5.js it is mathematically intensive

00:40:05.879 --> 00:40:12.719
Caption: you do have to think about how how you

00:40:09.719 --> 00:40:14.159
Caption: want to solve problems and that can be a

00:40:12.719 --> 00:40:16.320
Caption: bit daunting but it can also be very

00:40:14.159 --> 00:40:18.838
Caption: rewarding as I personally prefer

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:21.719
Caption: creating stuff in in Shader toy and

00:40:18.839 --> 00:40:24.420
Caption: creating shaders they they just sort of

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:25.199
Caption: Tickle My Fancy I suppose

00:40:24.419 --> 00:40:27.000
Caption: um

00:40:25.199 --> 00:40:29.219
Caption: but it also offers great opportunities

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.219
Caption: so things like fractals for example and

00:40:29.219 --> 00:40:34.078
Caption: that&#39;s that&#39;s fair field you just can&#39;t

00:40:32.219 --> 00:40:36.598
Caption: realistically do that in something like

00:40:34.079 --> 00:40:39.780
Caption: ip5.js

00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:40.859
Caption: um and I like the challenge right

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.959
Caption: but at the end of the day it&#39;s Different

00:40:40.858 --> 00:40:46.739
Caption: Strokes to different folks there is no

00:40:42.959 --> 00:40:49.379
Caption: best tool so use whatever suits you so

00:40:46.739 --> 00:40:51.320
Caption: use whichever is going to fulfill your

00:40:49.379 --> 00:40:54.059
Caption: needs

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.500
Caption: and think about what you want to create

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.300
Caption: what is the best tool going to be for

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.379
Caption: that

00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:01.140
Caption: and more importantly I think try to

00:40:58.379 --> 00:41:03.659
Caption: Master One I&#39;ve tried to to sort of do

00:41:01.139 --> 00:41:06.118
Caption: both and that&#39;s been that&#39;s been a

00:41:03.659 --> 00:41:07.979
Caption: challenge I I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve got very

00:41:06.118 --> 00:41:09.419
Caption: good at either of them I&#39;m still

00:41:07.979 --> 00:41:11.820
Caption: learning

00:41:09.419 --> 00:41:14.159
Caption: um so try to try to master one I&#39;ve seen

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:15.119
Caption: I think some of that stuff that that I&#39;m

00:41:14.159 --> 00:41:16.319
Caption: showing you today some of the other

00:41:15.118 --> 00:41:17.338
Caption: examples

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:20.520
Caption: um those are from people who have

00:41:17.339 --> 00:41:23.040
Caption: focused on on mastering one of them

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:24.300
Caption: so the key takeaways for today uh you

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.459
Caption: don&#39;t have to be an artist to create art

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.839
Caption: and I think it was Ralph Waldo Emerson

00:41:26.459 --> 00:41:29.060
Caption: who said every artist was first in

00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:33.180
Caption: amateur

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:34.739
Caption: so like try it don&#39;t be scared to uh

00:41:33.179 --> 00:41:38.338
Caption: pick the tool that suits you

00:41:34.739 --> 00:41:41.699
Caption: uh and experiment there is no right way

00:41:38.339 --> 00:41:43.440
Caption: to do it and the creative part of this I

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:47.040
Caption: think is the most important lesson in

00:41:43.439 --> 00:41:50.338
Caption: the coding it&#39;s being feeling free to

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:52.439
Caption: try and do new things

00:41:50.339 --> 00:41:53.579
Caption: um I just want to call out that I&#39;ve all

00:41:52.439 --> 00:41:54.899
Caption: of this and everything I&#39;ve learned I&#39;ve

00:41:53.579 --> 00:41:57.260
Caption: been standing on the shoulders of giants

00:41:54.899 --> 00:42:00.260
Caption: and in particular these individuals

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:02.939
Caption: and

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:04.618
Caption: especially the likes of Dan schiffman

00:42:02.939 --> 00:42:06.358
Caption: who&#39;s got a who&#39;s authored a book called

00:42:04.618 --> 00:42:09.598
Caption: nature of code which is absolutely worth

00:42:06.358 --> 00:42:12.679
Caption: a read and in your keyless who is just a

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:12.680
Caption: master at Shader toy

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.979
Caption: thank you very much

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:27.239
Caption: alrighty guys thank you so much first of

00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:30.180
Caption: all Brandon we&#39;ve had a few technical

00:42:27.239 --> 00:42:32.159
Caption: difficulties and we&#39;ll get that off but

00:42:30.179 --> 00:42:33.899
Caption: thank you all for coming

00:42:32.159 --> 00:42:36.598
