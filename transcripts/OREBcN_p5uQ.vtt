00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:06.480
Caption: all right so our first talk for today is

00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:08.760
Caption: Ricky Barnes who will be speaking about

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.319
Caption: Escaping The Vortex or how I learned to

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.579
Caption: stop procrastinating and get things done

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:13.798
Caption: mostly

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:15.718
Caption: so a little bit about Ricky Ricky Barnes

00:00:13.798 --> 00:00:17.579

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:22.319
Caption: her as a hard worker with an eye for

00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:23.938
Caption: detail

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.920
Caption: from her first homework extension in

00:00:23.938 --> 00:00:28.259
Caption: year three through two undergraduate

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.118
Caption: degrees and over 15 years of Industry

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.220
Caption: experience Ricky has honed a

00:00:30.118 --> 00:00:33.718
Caption: procrastination abilities to a truly

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.120
Caption: expert level

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.920
Caption: despite several gratifying achievements

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:39.840
Caption: such as never handling in a single

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:41.099
Caption: assignment on time throughout her second

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.559
Caption: degree

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:45.718
Caption: has embarked on a course correction of

00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:47.639
Caption: avoiding distractions prioritizing daily

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.399
Caption: objectives and claiming back her time

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:53.959
Caption: for real goals and priorities

00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:53.959
Caption: all right thank you Ricky

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:04.798
Caption: hi everyone as you heard I am a lifelong

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:07.199
Caption: procrastinator and about a year ago I

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.360
Caption: decided to get serious about trying to

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:11.819
Caption: be more effective because I&#39;m not just

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.220
Caption: an accomplished procrastinator I&#39;m also

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:16.319
Caption: very easily distracted and honestly

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.700
Caption: being an easily distracted

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.339
Caption: procrastinator

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:24.839
Caption: is very frustrating I end up cross with

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:27.118
Caption: myself a lot and being a little bit like

00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:29.599
Caption: why are you like this I say this to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.520
Caption: myself all the time

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:35.220
Caption: I called my talk Escaping The Vortex

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:36.959
Caption: because Vortex is a shorthand that one

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.579
Caption: of my friends and I have always used to

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.978
Caption: explain this Behavior where you get

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.959
Caption: sucked into something and you can&#39;t seem

00:01:40.978 --> 00:01:44.339
Caption: to stop yourself from doing it and

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.959
Caption: that&#39;s even if you&#39;ve got something else

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:47.099
Caption: that you should be doing or even if

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.680
Caption: there&#39;s something else that you would

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:52.379
Caption: rather be doing

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.419
Caption: so I&#39;m assuming since you&#39;re all here

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:57.379
Caption: you know how it feels to get sucked into

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:57.379
Caption: the Vortex right

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.959
Caption: so why do we get sucked into the Vortex

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:06.478
Caption: there&#39;s a couple of reasons

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.119
Caption: I think it&#39;s because the way our brains

00:02:06.478 --> 00:02:12.360
Caption: are wired makes us susceptible to growth

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.800
Caption: both procrastination and distraction and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.500
Caption: also because the things that are meant

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.900
Caption: to engage us specifically leverage that

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.539
Caption: in order to hook us in

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:23.819
Caption: I&#39;m gonna look at the reasons why we

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:26.279
Caption: procrastinate and how understanding that

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.839
Caption: can help us overcome it I&#39;m going to

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:30.419
Caption: give a couple of examples of when I&#39;ve

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:32.699
Caption: procrastinated dissect the reasons

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:35.639
Caption: behind it and then show the strategies

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:37.860
Caption: that I use to get back on track

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.779
Caption: with distraction we&#39;re going to discuss

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.518
Caption: a little bit of Behavioral Science but

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:44.279
Caption: not too much because it&#39;s complicated

00:02:41.518 --> 00:02:45.779
Caption: and it&#39;s kind of a vortex in itself

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:48.300
Caption: and then we&#39;re going to look at the

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:50.759
Caption: Practical steps that I took in order to

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.800
Caption: overcome distraction these steps are

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:55.259
Caption: aimed at both the external and the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.940
Caption: internal triggers of distraction

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:59.819
Caption: and those triggers are things that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.500
Caption: prompt us towards being distracted

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.839
Caption: to wind up I&#39;m going to show you some

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.419
Caption: stats that show how I improved my

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:09.000
Caption: performance at work if you&#39;re wondering

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.378
Caption: where this mostly comes into it it&#39;s

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.479
Caption: because I&#39;m still finding it pretty

00:03:10.378 --> 00:03:15.179
Caption: challenging to overcome distraction and

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:17.399
Caption: procrastination in my personal life

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:21.299
Caption: I&#39;m managing it a bit it&#39;s a bit better

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:23.579
Caption: than it was it&#39;s a work in progress

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.559
Caption: so to get started let&#39;s look at

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.540
Caption: procrastination

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.518
Caption: I think most people are pretty familiar

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.378
Caption: with procrastination there&#39;s something

00:03:29.518 --> 00:03:33.119
Caption: you&#39;re supposed to be doing often

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:35.399
Caption: something pretty important

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:38.839
Caption: but for some reason you just can&#39;t seem

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:38.839
Caption: to get started on doing it

00:03:40.018 --> 00:03:44.158
Caption: instead you&#39;re doing something that you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.878
Caption: know for a fact isn&#39;t helpful like

00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:49.619
Caption: watching TV or scrolling on social media

00:03:47.878 --> 00:03:51.419
Caption: or you&#39;re doing something that your

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:55.500
Caption: procrastination is sneakily trying to

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:59.000
Caption: pretend is helpful like just clearing my

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.000
Caption: desk so I can focus better

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:04.679
Caption: so I think when we think about

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:07.080
Caption: procrastination the instinct is to kind

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:08.598
Caption: of write it off as laziness or lack of

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.438
Caption: motivation

00:04:08.598 --> 00:04:13.139
Caption: hmm

00:04:10.438 --> 00:04:15.539
Caption: sorry excuse me

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.820
Caption: um so the fix is easy if you&#39;re a better

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:20.518
Caption: person with better self-control you

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.160
Caption: wouldn&#39;t procrastinate so much

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.320
Caption: right now this is obviously ridiculous

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.619
Caption: and yet it is the most common way that

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.259
Caption: people try and overcome procrastination

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:33.119
Caption: you do so you procrastinate you feel

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.000
Caption: guilty about it you beat yourself up

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:38.220
Caption: about it and then you promise yourself

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.440
Caption: you&#39;re going to do better maybe you even

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.899
Caption: do manage to do better for a while

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.179
Caption: but eventually you&#39;re going to end up

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:49.559
Caption: back a procrastination again

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:52.139
Caption: so why is this I think it&#39;s because

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:53.579
Caption: better self-control doesn&#39;t address the

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.419
Caption: underlying reasons behind

00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:56.418
Caption: procrastination

00:04:56.579 --> 00:05:00.059
Caption: so

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:02.220
Caption: it doesn&#39;t get to the root causes now

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:04.259
Caption: I&#39;m going to show here a list of reasons

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.940
Caption: for procrastination and it&#39;s pretty

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.320
Caption: comprehensive although I think you can

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.320
Caption: probably think of some others

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.220
Caption: but

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:15.959
Caption: sorry I&#39;m a little bit overwhelmed

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.739
Caption: feeling over

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:18.179
Caption: um

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:20.638
Caption: I think

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:22.380
Caption: if we look at this it seems a little bit

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.279
Caption: overwhelming in and of itself right this

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.139
Caption: is a very small font to be working with

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:31.739
Caption: but I think if we look into it a little

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.960
Caption: more closely we can see that these root

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:38.638
Caption: causes or these reasons can be broken

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:42.720
Caption: down into just five root causes or maybe

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:44.940
Caption: it can maybe it can&#39;t yes it can

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.699
Caption: okay now I&#39;m going to leave out the

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.440
Caption: physical and or mental factors

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.479
Caption: they&#39;re obviously a massive problem for

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.699
Caption: a lot of people but it&#39;s really above my

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.759
Caption: pay grade to be discussing them the only

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.860
Caption: thing I can say is that if these things

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.299
Caption: are a big issue for you

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:02.219
Caption: then you should address them first

00:06:00.299 --> 00:06:04.019
Caption: because otherwise any of the work you

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.919
Caption: try and do in any of these other areas

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:10.799
Caption: is going to be undermined

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.199
Caption: okay so damn it I keep pressing the

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:15.539
Caption: wrong button right so if we look at

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:19.080
Caption: what&#39;s left I think we can see that this

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:22.199
Caption: can be boiled down into just one thing

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:24.839
Caption: avoiding pain

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.059
Caption: it might be minor pain like my tax is

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:28.139
Caption: really boring or more significant pain

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:29.699
Caption: like

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.039
Caption: I&#39;m really stressed I&#39;m going to do a

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.419
Caption: bad job with my DDD talk and end up

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.519
Caption: looking like an idiot in front of a

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:39.139
Caption: bunch of people news flash it&#39;s kind of

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:39.138
Caption: happening guys so woo

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.679
Caption: um

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.259
Caption: look wherever it is whatever the reasons

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:48.179
Caption: where it leaves us is avoiding the pain

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:50.459
Caption: in the short term

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:52.679
Caption: but then that often leaves us with

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:53.880
Caption: greater pain in the longer term and

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:55.799
Caption: actually there&#39;s a lot of people who

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.080
Caption: work in this space that include that in

00:06:55.799 --> 00:06:59.759
Caption: their definition of procrastination it&#39;s

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:02.159
Caption: not just that we&#39;re putting off an

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:04.019
Caption: important task is also the knowledge

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.179
Caption: that we&#39;re going to be worse off for

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:07.500
Caption: having deleted we know this is what&#39;s

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:10.440
Caption: going to happen

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.279
Caption: and yet I do it all the time and that

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.279
Caption: brings us back to

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.039
Caption: you why are you like this why am I like

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:18.899
Caption: this

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:21.679
Caption: okay well I think if we look at a couple

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:21.679
Caption: of examples

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:27.419
Caption: let&#39;s start with tax like I was talking

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:30.119
Caption: about before it&#39;s really boring right so

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:32.399
Caption: the first reason is Task aversion it&#39;s

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:33.959
Caption: boring and it sucks and because I don&#39;t

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:36.000
Caption: want to do this boring task that sucks

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:36.959
Caption: throughout the year I Leave It All To

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.059
Caption: the End

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:40.739
Caption: where it takes longer and is therefore

00:07:39.059 --> 00:07:43.380
Caption: more boring

00:07:40.739 --> 00:07:45.779
Caption: and because it takes longer I need

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.639
Caption: elevated levels of perseverance but I

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:49.739
Caption: don&#39;t have that because the task is

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:52.559
Caption: boring and it sucks

00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:55.079
Caption: now that could explain everything right

00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:57.598
Caption: it&#39;s boring it sucks no wonder I want to

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:59.279
Caption: procrastinate but actually if we dig a

00:07:57.598 --> 00:08:00.660
Caption: little further into it there are a

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:02.519
Caption: couple of things around the future that

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.539
Caption: come into play

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:05.220
Caption: so

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:07.319
Caption: it doesn&#39;t take me long to do my tax

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.179
Caption: right it&#39;s maybe like an hour and a half

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:11.039
Caption: and the government is just going to give

00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:12.239
Caption: me money they&#39;re just going to give it

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:14.940
Caption: to me

00:08:12.239 --> 00:08:16.619
Caption: why wouldn&#39;t I just do it

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.598
Caption: well

00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:21.419
Caption: the thing is by the time I accountant

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:23.878
Caption: files and the government processes it&#39;s

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:26.339
Caption: kind of a little bit far in the future

00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:27.839
Caption: so there&#39;s a delayed outcome it&#39;s not

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.940
Caption: like there&#39;s a guy standing next to me

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:33.179
Caption: with a lot of cash going if you do this

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.278
Caption: for an hour you can have this

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:37.559
Caption: and it&#39;s not even that far in the future

00:08:35.278 --> 00:08:39.299
Caption: but the reason it becomes important is

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.380
Caption: because there&#39;s a disconnect with My

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:42.059
Caption: Future Self

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.640
Caption: I&#39;m like

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:47.099
Caption: I&#39;m doing all this work so her in three

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.140
Caption: weeks time gets a cash present what am I

00:08:47.099 --> 00:08:52.199
Caption: getting out of this now what I&#39;m getting

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:55.559
Caption: out of it is obviously the cash present

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:59.299
Caption: because I&#39;m the same person but in the

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:59.299
Caption: moment it doesn&#39;t feel like that

00:08:59.458 --> 00:09:03.119
Caption: the last thing is that this is a bit of

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.820
Caption: an abstract goal I don&#39;t have anything

00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:07.380
Caption: specifically that I&#39;m saving for there&#39;s

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.398
Caption: nothing I&#39;ve really earmarked this money

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.660
Caption: for

00:09:08.398 --> 00:09:11.278
Caption: so

00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:12.979
Caption: there&#39;s not really anything specific

00:09:11.278 --> 00:09:16.859
Caption: that would make me

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:19.619
Caption: motivated to strive to do this

00:09:16.859 --> 00:09:21.119
Caption: now if we look at another task oh sorry

00:09:19.619 --> 00:09:22.979
Caption: gone a little bit far if we&#39;re going to

00:09:21.119 --> 00:09:24.479
Caption: look at another task which is a

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.500
Caption: development task that I had to do at

00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:27.239
Caption: work

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.640
Caption: so we had a bit of a collaborative

00:09:27.239 --> 00:09:31.679
Caption: strategy meeting about what I would be

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.720
Caption: doing but it wasn&#39;t something I&#39;d done

00:09:31.679 --> 00:09:36.119
Caption: before so I didn&#39;t really know what I

00:09:33.719 --> 00:09:39.299
Caption: was doing so the first one as you got a

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:40.619
Caption: preview of is indecisiveness there were

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:42.659
Caption: a couple of different paths I could take

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:45.000
Caption: because I hadn&#39;t done it before I didn&#39;t

00:09:42.659 --> 00:09:46.739
Caption: know which one would be the best one

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.859
Caption: I was also feeling a little bit

00:09:46.739 --> 00:09:51.059
Caption: overwhelmed because I hadn&#39;t done it

00:09:49.859 --> 00:09:53.579
Caption: before

00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:56.898
Caption: I was a little bit out of my depth

00:09:53.580 --> 00:10:00.660
Caption: then I had general anxiety specifically

00:09:56.898 --> 00:10:02.518
Caption: around the deadline because it was a

00:10:00.659 --> 00:10:04.799
Caption: hard deadline and I knew that I had to

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:07.139
Caption: meet it it was a hard deadline that was

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:08.820
Caption: a little bit tight actually so the

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.700
Caption: pressure was on

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:14.820
Caption: then there&#39;s fear of evaluation and this

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:17.940
Caption: one is because my leader is this like

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:20.160
Caption: insane code Whisperer genius person and

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.500
Caption: that&#39;s usually a really good thing but

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:25.799
Caption: it always adds an extra level of fear

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.958
Caption: about how good my code is

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:29.159
Caption: then there&#39;s a bit of task aversion in

00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.320
Caption: this one as well

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:33.119
Caption: and that&#39;s mainly because I could help

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.059
Caption: this by doing a little bit of research

00:10:33.119 --> 00:10:38.338
Caption: but I really find going on to like stack

00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:40.739
Caption: Overflow or

00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:42.299
Caption: browsing through random repos usually a

00:10:40.739 --> 00:10:44.700
Caption: bit tedious

00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:46.200
Caption: so if we put all that together it&#39;s not

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.359
Caption: hard to see where I want to put this off

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.940
Caption: right if I don&#39;t even think about this

00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:52.619
Caption: task I&#39;m going to be saving myself a lot

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.140
Caption: of discomfort

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:56.159
Caption: but that&#39;s only in the short term in the

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.380
Caption: long term

00:10:56.159 --> 00:11:01.940
Caption: I&#39;m going to be adding fear of failure

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:04.559
Caption: to my list because if I waste time

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:07.640
Caption: there&#39;s a real possibility that I&#39;m

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:07.640
Caption: going to miss the deadline

00:11:21.179 --> 00:11:24.719
Caption: all right sorry

00:11:23.219 --> 00:11:26.458
Caption: um so you can see my reasons for

00:11:24.719 --> 00:11:28.319
Caption: procrastination with both of these

00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:30.479
Caption: things were very different

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.640
Caption: okay

00:11:30.479 --> 00:11:35.278
Caption: now we&#39;ve discovered what my reasons for

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:38.160
Caption: doing this were let&#39;s see what we can do

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:40.380
Caption: to help me from stop to stop me from

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:43.379
Caption: procrastinating

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.898
Caption: this is again a comprehensive list with

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.239
Caption: quite small font of some of the common

00:11:45.898 --> 00:11:51.979
Caption: things that people suggest that you

00:11:48.239 --> 00:11:51.979
Caption: might use to overcome procrastination

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:56.419
Caption: how

00:11:54.359 --> 00:11:56.419
Caption: um

00:11:56.518 --> 00:12:00.958
Caption: I think this is probably a lot to take

00:11:58.739 --> 00:12:03.059
Caption: in but the one I would suggest paying

00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.559
Caption: attention to the most is this figuring

00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:06.719
Caption: out the exact nature of your

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:08.159
Caption: procrastination problem which is what we

00:12:06.719 --> 00:12:10.199
Caption: just went through there

00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:10.979
Caption: I think this should always be the first

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.500
Caption: step

00:12:10.979 --> 00:12:16.260
Caption: because the reasons that we process

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.880
Caption: procrastinate as we just saw are always

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.338
Caption: very different and that means that you

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.260
Caption: need different tools to overcome it you

00:12:20.338 --> 00:12:24.739
Caption: can&#39;t apply the same stuff in every

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.739
Caption: situation

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:28.679
Caption: okay

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.898
Caption: so

00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:32.219
Caption: if we return to my tax problem these are

00:12:30.898 --> 00:12:34.018
Caption: all the reasons that I was

00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:35.458
Caption: procrastinating

00:12:34.018 --> 00:12:38.940
Caption: and we&#39;ll look at how I&#39;m going to

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:40.859
Caption: overcome this one so task aversion I&#39;m

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.479
Caption: going to address by making a low bar

00:12:40.859 --> 00:12:44.518
Caption: commitment

00:12:42.479 --> 00:12:45.539
Caption: what I&#39;m going to do in this case is to

00:12:44.518 --> 00:12:47.219
Caption: say

00:12:45.539 --> 00:12:48.778
Caption: work on this for five minutes and then

00:12:47.219 --> 00:12:50.219
Caption: you can do 10 minutes of whatever you

00:12:48.778 --> 00:12:51.898
Caption: want I&#39;m going to work on it for five

00:12:50.219 --> 00:12:54.000
Caption: minutes again then I can do 10 minutes

00:12:51.898 --> 00:12:55.739
Caption: of whatever I want now this is going to

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.159
Caption: work for me for a couple of reasons

00:12:55.739 --> 00:13:00.659
Caption: because it&#39;s extremely short term I&#39;m

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:02.458
Caption: going to get a reward almost straight

00:13:00.659 --> 00:13:03.958
Caption: away

00:13:02.458 --> 00:13:06.179
Caption: it&#39;s going to stop me from feeling

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:09.479
Caption: guilty about prioritizing my short-term

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:11.458
Caption: mood because actually now that I&#39;ve said

00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:13.440
Caption: I can have those 10 minutes of reward

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:15.539
Caption: those 10 minutes are no longer

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.179
Caption: procrastination they&#39;re actually what I

00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:20.699
Caption: said I was going to do in my plan

00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:22.859
Caption: it&#39;s also going to get me started on the

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.179
Caption: task so I can stop feeling guilty that

00:13:22.859 --> 00:13:26.039
Caption: I&#39;m putting it off

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:28.138
Caption: I don&#39;t have to have that dread hanging

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:29.039
Caption: over me that oh God I really should do

00:13:28.138 --> 00:13:31.440
Caption: it

00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:32.578
Caption: this is also going to address my lack of

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.898
Caption: perseverance

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:35.278
Caption: because I only have to do it for five

00:13:33.898 --> 00:13:37.559
Caption: minutes

00:13:35.278 --> 00:13:39.898
Caption: it&#39;s not really needing that much

00:13:37.559 --> 00:13:42.719
Caption: self-control to keep going with it

00:13:39.898 --> 00:13:45.419
Caption: the key thing with this is obviously

00:13:42.719 --> 00:13:47.159
Caption: once you get started on a task

00:13:45.419 --> 00:13:49.138
Caption: five minutes can slip away really

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:51.299
Caption: quickly and actually find out it&#39;s not

00:13:49.138 --> 00:13:53.039
Caption: as bad as you thought it was so now that

00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:54.958
Caption: I&#39;ve got myself started I&#39;m probably

00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:56.099
Caption: going to be engrossed and when the five

00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.659
Caption: minutes are up

00:13:56.099 --> 00:13:59.398
Caption: I&#39;m maybe not going to want to actually

00:13:57.659 --> 00:14:00.958
Caption: stop I&#39;m probably halfway through

00:13:59.398 --> 00:14:02.518
Caption: something that I don&#39;t want to leave

00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:05.958
Caption: unfinished

00:14:02.518 --> 00:14:05.958
Caption: so I&#39;ve got myself moving

00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:12.059
Caption: so my abstract goal I&#39;m going to address

00:14:09.419 --> 00:14:13.440
Caption: by attaching meaning to the task now

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:16.200
Caption: there&#39;s a couple of things that I can

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:19.380
Caption: attach meaning to here firstly there&#39;s

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:22.440
Caption: the reward which is getting my return

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:24.838
Caption: secondly there&#39;s the negative outcome of

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.539
Caption: getting a fine from the ATO which has

00:14:24.838 --> 00:14:30.059
Caption: happened to me before

00:14:27.539 --> 00:14:31.979
Caption: okay and I actually get fairly

00:14:30.059 --> 00:14:34.018
Caption: frustrated with myself when I end up

00:14:31.979 --> 00:14:36.239
Caption: with a stupid fine over nothing that was

00:14:34.018 --> 00:14:37.799
Caption: completely avoidable so what I&#39;m gonna

00:14:36.239 --> 00:14:40.320
Caption: do

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:42.479
Caption: is visualize the outcomes of me doing

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.518
Caption: this work or in that case not doing the

00:14:42.479 --> 00:14:46.380
Caption: work I can remind myself that I&#39;m going

00:14:44.518 --> 00:14:49.018
Caption: to be really frustrated if I get a fine

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:51.000
Caption: and then I can also visualize that I&#39;m

00:14:49.018 --> 00:14:52.799
Caption: going to get this little return it&#39;s

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.500
Caption: going to be in my bank balance it&#39;s

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:58.440
Caption: going to be a great time

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.179
Caption: okay I&#39;m also going to reward myself and

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.159
Caption: that&#39;s going to

00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:04.078
Caption: help me with the delayed outcomes

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:05.940
Caption: problem it&#39;s not an immediate reward

00:15:04.078 --> 00:15:07.859
Caption: like my 10 minutes what it&#39;s going to be

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.659
Caption: is something tangible

00:15:07.859 --> 00:15:10.919
Caption: so I&#39;m going to get my return from the

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:12.719
Caption: government

00:15:10.919 --> 00:15:16.198
Caption: and then what I&#39;m going to do with that

00:15:12.719 --> 00:15:18.239
Caption: is actually say I&#39;m going to buy x with

00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:19.559
Caption: it specifically something that I want

00:15:18.239 --> 00:15:20.820
Caption: right

00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:23.219
Caption: and then I&#39;m going to say to myself

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:26.958
Caption: you&#39;re not allowed to buy eggs

00:15:23.219 --> 00:15:26.958
Caption: unless you do your tax return

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:34.198
Caption: so now this is my task at work that I

00:15:32.338 --> 00:15:36.479
Caption: was procrastinating on

00:15:34.198 --> 00:15:38.698
Caption: there&#39;s my little things including the

00:15:36.479 --> 00:15:42.898
Caption: fear of failure that came in at the end

00:15:38.698 --> 00:15:45.000
Caption: and I&#39;m gonna address my indecisiveness

00:15:42.898 --> 00:15:46.919
Caption: by sitting down with someone for five

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.299
Caption: minutes and having them act as my rubber

00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:50.518
Caption: ducky I&#39;m gonna have a little

00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:52.619
Caption: conversation I&#39;m going to be able to

00:15:50.518 --> 00:15:53.940
Caption: outline my thoughts more clearly and I&#39;m

00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:56.278
Caption: going to clarify how I&#39;m going to work

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:59.220
Caption: to towards a solution

00:15:56.278 --> 00:16:01.739
Caption: now their input is also going to give me

00:15:59.219 --> 00:16:04.018
Caption: other ideas or other avenues that I

00:16:01.739 --> 00:16:06.419
Caption: might want to explore

00:16:04.018 --> 00:16:08.099
Caption: that&#39;s also going to help me with my

00:16:06.419 --> 00:16:09.659
Caption: feeling overwhelm my feeling of being

00:16:08.099 --> 00:16:13.919
Caption: overwhelmed

00:16:09.659 --> 00:16:15.000
Caption: because now I&#39;ve got a plan in place

00:16:13.919 --> 00:16:17.039
Caption: I&#39;m further going to help my

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.619
Caption: indecisiveness and my feeling of being

00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:21.239
Caption: overwhelmed by creating and implementing

00:16:19.619 --> 00:16:24.359
Caption: a plan

00:16:21.239 --> 00:16:27.179
Caption: what I&#39;m going to do is break this large

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:28.500
Caption: task down into small and manageable

00:16:27.179 --> 00:16:31.159
Caption: tasks

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.159
Caption: and then

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.820
Caption: I&#39;m going to set an intermediate

00:16:33.119 --> 00:16:37.078
Caption: deadline for each of those tasks that&#39;s

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.578
Caption: going to help me with my deadline

00:16:37.078 --> 00:16:40.739
Caption: anxiety

00:16:38.578 --> 00:16:42.659
Caption: because now I&#39;m going to be able to see

00:16:40.739 --> 00:16:44.758
Caption: if I&#39;m getting off track

00:16:42.659 --> 00:16:47.518
Caption: and I&#39;m going to be able to manage my

00:16:44.758 --> 00:16:49.440
Caption: time more effectively

00:16:47.518 --> 00:16:52.198
Caption: this is also going to help me with my

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.239
Caption: fear of failure because if I know that

00:16:52.198 --> 00:16:56.398
Caption: I&#39;m on track all the time or if I know

00:16:54.239 --> 00:16:58.679
Caption: I&#39;m getting off track I can ask for

00:16:56.398 --> 00:17:00.299
Caption: other tasks to be reassigned I can ask

00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:02.278
Caption: for another developer to come in and

00:17:00.299 --> 00:17:04.078
Caption: give me support any of that kind of

00:17:02.278 --> 00:17:05.698
Caption: stuff so I&#39;m no longer worried that I&#39;m

00:17:04.078 --> 00:17:07.380
Caption: going to miss the deadline it&#39;s just not

00:17:05.698 --> 00:17:11.780
Caption: going to happen anymore

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.780
Caption: my fear of evaluation oh sorry

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.780
Caption: I&#39;m now in a good place to make a low

00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:18.958
Caption: bar commitment even though this task is

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:21.359
Caption: much bigger than the the tax task I can

00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:23.458
Caption: still get myself going by saying I&#39;ll

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:25.619
Caption: just do five minutes because I&#39;ve got

00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:26.760
Caption: all these interim tasks that are much

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:28.500
Caption: smaller

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.839
Caption: they&#39;re not as overwhelming to think

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:33.540
Caption: about as the full thing I don&#39;t have to

00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:35.699
Caption: keep putting it off because I know that

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.859
Caption: there are smaller tasks that I can do

00:17:35.699 --> 00:17:40.079
Caption: the other thing my tasks are going to do

00:17:37.859 --> 00:17:43.798
Caption: is allow me to choose the order I do

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:45.959
Caption: them carefully so for some people this

00:17:43.798 --> 00:17:48.418
Caption: looks like getting the least attractive

00:17:45.959 --> 00:17:49.678
Caption: thing out the way right Someone I used

00:17:48.418 --> 00:17:53.038
Caption: to work with used to say if you have to

00:17:49.678 --> 00:17:55.439
Caption: eat a frog eat it first thing

00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:58.079
Caption: there&#39;s another group of people who like

00:17:55.439 --> 00:17:59.939
Caption: to get themselves motivated

00:17:58.079 --> 00:18:01.739
Caption: feeling good about themselves and psych

00:17:59.939 --> 00:18:03.538
Caption: themselves up by Crossing off a few

00:18:01.739 --> 00:18:05.339
Caption: little tasks you&#39;ve got a couple of wins

00:18:03.538 --> 00:18:07.558
Caption: in the bag you&#39;ve had a couple little

00:18:05.339 --> 00:18:09.000
Caption: things that you&#39;ve ticked off and so

00:18:07.558 --> 00:18:10.798
Caption: you&#39;re feeling good and ready to go on

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.079
Caption: to the other stuff it doesn&#39;t really

00:18:10.798 --> 00:18:15.599
Caption: matter which type of person you are

00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:17.519
Caption: but if you understand which type then

00:18:15.599 --> 00:18:19.678
Caption: you can choose your task order carefully

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.459
Caption: and that can also help you avoid

00:18:19.678 --> 00:18:22.459
Caption: procrastination

00:18:22.798 --> 00:18:26.219
Caption: now

00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:27.779
Caption: I&#39;m going to talk about prioritizing

00:18:26.219 --> 00:18:29.459
Caption: your tasks by importance which sounds

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.520
Caption: like a kind of counterman&#39;s the one

00:18:29.459 --> 00:18:35.279
Caption: we&#39;ve just said but they work together

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.739
Caption: because one of the caveats of choosing

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.679
Caption: your task order is that you can actually

00:18:37.739 --> 00:18:43.439
Caption: use the subtasks to procrastinate on the

00:18:40.678 --> 00:18:44.939
Caption: main task because procrastination is

00:18:43.439 --> 00:18:48.058
Caption: very sneaky

00:18:44.939 --> 00:18:49.918
Caption: of had a file open it&#39;s the file I&#39;m

00:18:48.058 --> 00:18:53.399
Caption: supposed to be working on I&#39;m literally

00:18:49.918 --> 00:18:55.319
Caption: working on it I&#39;m like writing code and

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.780
Caption: it&#39;s still procrastination because it

00:18:55.319 --> 00:18:58.979
Caption: isn&#39;t the task that I opened the file to

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.020
Caption: do

00:18:58.979 --> 00:19:03.538
Caption: the reason I&#39;m choosing to do this

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:06.239
Caption: little easy task fixing up the way the

00:19:03.538 --> 00:19:09.359
Caption: header displays is because I&#39;m

00:19:06.239 --> 00:19:11.579
Caption: procrastinating on the more daunting

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:14.280
Caption: part of the task

00:19:11.579 --> 00:19:16.199
Caption: so I&#39;m gonna avoid that by also

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.539
Caption: prioritizing if I&#39;m the sort of person

00:19:16.199 --> 00:19:20.099
Caption: that needs to psych myself up I&#39;m going

00:19:18.538 --> 00:19:22.439
Caption: to give myself permission to do one or

00:19:20.099 --> 00:19:25.038
Caption: two little things and then straight into

00:19:22.439 --> 00:19:25.038
Caption: the next one

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:30.719
Caption: so my fear of evaluation I&#39;m going to

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.940
Caption: sort out by acknowledging that my work

00:19:30.719 --> 00:19:35.459
Caption: is going to have some flaws

00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:37.678
Caption: and the thing about my flaws is

00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:39.719
Caption: they&#39;re not a reflection on my worth as

00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:41.579
Caption: a person which is how it can feel

00:19:39.719 --> 00:19:43.859
Caption: sometimes right

00:19:41.579 --> 00:19:45.479
Caption: actually they&#39;re a learning opportunity

00:19:43.859 --> 00:19:47.520
Caption: it&#39;s something that I&#39;m going to know

00:19:45.479 --> 00:19:49.859
Caption: better for next time

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.020
Caption: now everything I&#39;ve done so far actually

00:19:49.859 --> 00:19:54.000
Caption: helps me with my task aversion because

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.260
Caption: I&#39;m a lot clearer on what it is that I&#39;m

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.140
Caption: doing

00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:00.419
Caption: I don&#39;t have to well probably won&#39;t have

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.039
Caption: to go and consult the internet right I

00:20:00.418 --> 00:20:03.599
Caption: don&#39;t have to consult it straight away I

00:20:02.038 --> 00:20:06.058
Caption: might not have to at all

00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:08.219
Caption: if I do I&#39;m going to be able to be more

00:20:06.058 --> 00:20:10.260
Caption: focused in what I&#39;m searching for I&#39;m

00:20:08.219 --> 00:20:12.058
Caption: not doing generalized research I&#39;m going

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.678
Caption: to be looking for specific problem

00:20:12.058 --> 00:20:17.719
Caption: solving

00:20:13.678 --> 00:20:17.719
Caption: so that is also going to be addressed

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:23.760
Caption: all right so you can see that on the

00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:26.579
Caption: surface these things look similar right

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:30.058
Caption: it was two tasks I was putting them off

00:20:26.579 --> 00:20:33.359
Caption: I knew it was a bad idea

00:20:30.058 --> 00:20:35.339
Caption: probably I&#39;m just a bad person right

00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:37.859
Caption: actually

00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:40.140
Caption: if we look at it closely what we can see

00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:42.359
Caption: is not only is this not a moral failing

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.400
Caption: on my part but the reasons are so

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:46.439
Caption: different that my strategies need to be

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.000
Caption: different to deal with them as well and

00:20:46.439 --> 00:20:50.579
Caption: that&#39;s what I want you to remember about

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.558
Caption: procrastination

00:20:50.579 --> 00:20:54.479
Caption: now I&#39;m going to move on to the second

00:20:52.558 --> 00:20:56.459
Caption: part of the presentation and talk about

00:20:54.479 --> 00:20:57.479
Caption: distraction

00:20:56.459 --> 00:20:58.859
Caption: now

00:20:57.479 --> 00:20:59.880
Caption: I&#39;m not going to be all down on

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:01.678
Caption: technology

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.819
Caption: I love technology

00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:04.678
Caption: but

00:21:02.819 --> 00:21:07.079
Caption: I think it&#39;s important for us to admit

00:21:04.678 --> 00:21:09.239
Caption: out loud that in this wonderful world

00:21:07.079 --> 00:21:12.298
Caption: we&#39;ve built of instantaneous connection

00:21:09.239 --> 00:21:14.160
Caption: and instantaneous content there are more

00:21:12.298 --> 00:21:16.639
Caption: things competing for our attention than

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.640
Caption: ever before

00:21:20.219 --> 00:21:24.959
Caption: and a lot of those things were designed

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:27.178
Caption: to specifically hook us in they&#39;re

00:21:24.959 --> 00:21:31.399
Caption: leveraging that brain pattern to keep us

00:21:27.178 --> 00:21:31.399
Caption: coming back again and again

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.520
Caption: right it&#39;s not really surprising under

00:21:33.839 --> 00:21:37.500
Caption: these circumstances that we find

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.839
Caption: ourselves getting sucked into the Vortex

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.819
Caption: maybe we&#39;re scrolling endlessly on

00:21:39.839 --> 00:21:45.538
Caption: social media

00:21:41.819 --> 00:21:47.519
Caption: maybe we&#39;re binging a whole TV series

00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:49.918
Caption: maybe we&#39;re hooked on a notification

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.440
Caption: badge or we find ourselves unable to let

00:21:49.918 --> 00:21:55.279
Caption: an email go unanswered even though we&#39;re

00:21:52.439 --> 00:21:55.279
Caption: in the middle of a task

00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:08.099
Caption: now this might seem innocuous

00:22:06.239 --> 00:22:10.140
Caption: like does it really matter if you take

00:22:08.099 --> 00:22:12.359
Caption: 30 seconds out of your day to answer an

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:15.239
Caption: email and actually it kind of does and

00:22:12.359 --> 00:22:16.918
Caption: we&#39;re going to come back to that

00:22:15.239 --> 00:22:19.140
Caption: you might also think

00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:21.000
Caption: if I&#39;m just sitting at home on the couch

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.500
Caption: after work shouldn&#39;t I be able to scroll

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.359
Caption: as much as I want

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.699
Caption: and yeah maybe you should

00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:28.439
Caption: but where it becomes a problem is where

00:22:26.699 --> 00:22:30.479
Caption: distraction stops us from doing the

00:22:28.439 --> 00:22:33.599
Caption: things that are really important to us

00:22:30.479 --> 00:22:36.538
Caption: so in your personal life that might look

00:22:33.599 --> 00:22:38.459
Caption: like you not being as present for your

00:22:36.538 --> 00:22:40.379
Caption: kids as you&#39;d like it might look like

Caption: your relationship

00:22:41.699 --> 00:22:48.058

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:50.219
Caption: an advanced state of chaos all the time

00:22:48.058 --> 00:22:52.020
Caption: whatever it is it&#39;s likely to be

00:22:50.219 --> 00:22:53.459
Caption: something that you&#39;re aware of and it&#39;s

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.380
Caption: likely to be something that causes you

00:22:53.459 --> 00:22:56.779
Caption: pain and you know how we like to deal

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.520
Caption: with pain

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:01.679
Caption: procrastination and that&#39;s how you end

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.419
Caption: up in that Loop where at the end of the

00:23:01.678 --> 00:23:05.760
Caption: weekend you&#39;ve only got a tenth of your

00:23:03.418 --> 00:23:07.500
Caption: tasks done and you know full well it&#39;s

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.640
Caption: your own fault because you spent most of

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.640
Caption: the time binging Netflix

00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:13.099
Caption: um

00:23:13.918 --> 00:23:18.959
Caption: so

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:21.119
Caption: when this happens we&#39;re most likely

00:23:18.959 --> 00:23:24.839
Caption: going to end up back at

00:23:21.119 --> 00:23:27.319
Caption: why are you like this I do it a lot

00:23:24.839 --> 00:23:27.319
Caption: okay

00:23:28.199 --> 00:23:34.380
Caption: like procrastination the most easy

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:37.859
Caption: solution easy solution to distraction

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:40.020
Caption: is better self-control again if you&#39;re a

00:23:37.859 --> 00:23:42.658
Caption: better person you wouldn&#39;t spend as much

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:45.058
Caption: time mindlessly scrolling

00:23:42.659 --> 00:23:46.919
Caption: now I&#39;m going to go into a little bit of

00:23:45.058 --> 00:23:48.779
Caption: this complicated Behavioral Science we

00:23:46.918 --> 00:23:50.339
Caption: spoke about before

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.900
Caption: because I want to explain to you

00:23:50.339 --> 00:23:54.719
Caption: something that&#39;s called ironic process

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.099
Caption: Theory because this shows why better

00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:57.900
Caption: self-control

00:23:56.099 --> 00:23:59.579
Caption: mental abstinence

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.559
Caption: which is

00:23:59.579 --> 00:24:03.000
Caption: using your self-control to stop yourself

00:24:01.558 --> 00:24:05.939
Caption: from doing something that you actually

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.619
Caption: really want to do isn&#39;t the answer to

00:24:05.939 --> 00:24:10.079
Caption: distraction

00:24:07.619 --> 00:24:11.939
Caption: so it starts with this quote which is

00:24:10.079 --> 00:24:14.699
Caption: from Dostoyevsky

00:24:11.939 --> 00:24:16.798
Caption: try to pose for yourself this task not

00:24:14.699 --> 00:24:18.359
Caption: to think of a white bear and you will

00:24:16.798 --> 00:24:21.380
Caption: see that the curse thing will come to

00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:21.380
Caption: mind every minute

00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:24.619
Caption: he&#39;s an outlaw guys

00:24:24.659 --> 00:24:30.539
Caption: so fast forwarding 120 odd years a

00:24:27.959 --> 00:24:32.640
Caption: social psychologist called Daniel Wagner

00:24:30.538 --> 00:24:34.139
Caption: decided to put this to the task he

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.419
Caption: really liked this quote so he was like

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:39.539
Caption: let&#39;s do an experiment

00:24:36.418 --> 00:24:41.459
Caption: so he had two groups one group was told

00:24:39.538 --> 00:24:43.979
Caption: specifically to think of a white bear

00:24:41.459 --> 00:24:46.079
Caption: for five minutes one group was told

00:24:43.979 --> 00:24:48.418
Caption: specifically to not think of a white

00:24:46.079 --> 00:24:50.459
Caption: bear now the group that was told not to

00:24:48.418 --> 00:24:52.739
Caption: failed miserably they did it on average

00:24:50.459 --> 00:24:55.140
Caption: once a minute and that&#39;s kind of what

00:24:52.739 --> 00:24:56.939
Caption: we&#39;re expecting because this quote Rings

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:59.820
Caption: true for most people right

00:24:56.939 --> 00:25:01.558
Caption: the interesting part is the second half

00:24:59.819 --> 00:25:03.658
Caption: of the experiment was to tell both

00:25:01.558 --> 00:25:05.699
Caption: groups to think of the white bear

00:25:03.659 --> 00:25:07.679
Caption: and when they did that the group that

00:25:05.699 --> 00:25:09.658
Caption: had initially suppressed the thoughts of

00:25:07.678 --> 00:25:12.000
Caption: the white bear actually brought the

00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:13.860
Caption: white bed to mind more readily than the

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.599
Caption: group who had been told to think of it

00:25:13.859 --> 00:25:17.880
Caption: all along

00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:20.280
Caption: what Wagner found is that if you try and

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.380
Caption: suppress thoughts of something it

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.719
Caption: actually makes you more susceptible to

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:27.000
Caption: that thing this is called behavioral

00:25:24.719 --> 00:25:28.140
Caption: rebound and it works in everything from

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.359
Caption: like

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:33.260
Caption: trying to control addiction to trying to

00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:33.260
Caption: suppress your laughter

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.459
Caption: all right

00:25:37.199 --> 00:25:40.260
Caption: so

00:25:38.459 --> 00:25:42.239
Caption: there are a couple of techniques that

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.919
Caption: you can find for trying to deal with

00:25:42.239 --> 00:25:46.678
Caption: intrusive thoughts that are brought to

00:25:43.918 --> 00:25:48.239
Caption: mind that cause behavioral rebound but

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:50.519
Caption: they&#39;re mostly for things like if you&#39;re

00:25:48.239 --> 00:25:53.339
Caption: quitting smoking

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.440
Caption: for distraction I&#39;ve found the easiest

00:25:53.339 --> 00:25:57.538
Caption: way to deal with it is just to remove

00:25:55.439 --> 00:25:58.739
Caption: the stimulus

00:25:57.538 --> 00:26:02.278
Caption: right

00:25:58.739 --> 00:26:04.380
Caption: I know that I&#39;m susceptible to alerts

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:06.600
Caption: and notifications so what I&#39;m going to

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.739
Caption: do is simply stop that from being able

00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:09.778
Caption: to happen

00:26:07.739 --> 00:26:11.640
Caption: so I started with the biggest culprit

00:26:09.779 --> 00:26:15.000
Caption: which was my phone

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:17.279
Caption: I just reconfigured it so I uninstalled

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.500
Caption: some apps goodbye Reddit goodbye

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:21.900
Caption: wordscapes

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.579
Caption: and it didn&#39;t take long for me to be

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.900
Caption: broken from the habit of those two

00:26:23.579 --> 00:26:26.519
Caption: things right

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.500
Caption: and actually an interesting thing

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.179
Caption: happened which is that my nieces asked

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.038
Caption: me if they could reinstall wordscapes

00:26:30.178 --> 00:26:35.038
Caption: and I let them

00:26:32.038 --> 00:26:37.379
Caption: because they like to play it it&#39;s like

00:26:35.038 --> 00:26:40.379
Caption: all right it&#39;s a problem for me but okay

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.520
Caption: and actually as it turns out it wasn&#39;t a

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.739
Caption: problem for me

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:46.558
Caption: I know it&#39;s there it&#39;s still there it&#39;s

00:26:43.739 --> 00:26:48.719
Caption: still installed I never open it they use

00:26:46.558 --> 00:26:52.939
Caption: it and they&#39;re the only ones who do

00:26:48.719 --> 00:26:52.939
Caption: and that&#39;s because I broke the habit

00:27:00.239 --> 00:27:04.619
Caption: the second thing that I did with my

00:27:01.798 --> 00:27:07.380
Caption: phone was to configure the notifications

00:27:04.619 --> 00:27:09.538
Caption: so I&#39;ve always had lock screen

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:12.298
Caption: notification disabled that&#39;s just how I

00:27:09.538 --> 00:27:13.678
Caption: roll but I did always have like an audio

00:27:12.298 --> 00:27:15.538
Caption: alert that comes up you get a little

00:27:13.678 --> 00:27:17.158
Caption: ping you&#39;re like oh what&#39;s this and you

00:27:15.538 --> 00:27:19.139
Caption: go and look at it right

00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:21.299
Caption: so what I did with that was I actually

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.640
Caption: configured my do not disturb so that I

00:27:21.298 --> 00:27:26.819
Caption: can have it switched on permanently

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:29.400
Caption: so what I let come through is nothing

00:27:26.819 --> 00:27:31.319
Caption: but phone calls I decided I want pretty

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.400
Caption: much anyone to always be able to get me

00:27:31.319 --> 00:27:35.519
Caption: on the phone

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:37.140
Caption: maybe not your telemarketers but if

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.880
Caption: something important or crucial is going

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.919
Caption: to happen to my friends to my family

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.558
Caption: they&#39;re gonna pick up the phone and call

00:27:40.918 --> 00:27:45.178
Caption: me so anyone can always call me but

00:27:43.558 --> 00:27:48.178
Caption: apart from that everything else is

00:27:45.178 --> 00:27:50.239
Caption: completely silent so now the only way

00:27:48.178 --> 00:27:54.119
Caption: that I know if I&#39;ve got a text message

00:27:50.239 --> 00:27:56.640
Caption: an email from a non-work account

00:27:54.119 --> 00:27:58.619
Caption: a notification from one of the like four

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.520
Caption: different instant messaging platforms I

00:27:58.619 --> 00:28:02.400
Caption: have

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:05.219
Caption: is if I pick up my phone and unlock it

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.320
Caption: and explicitly look for it

00:28:05.219 --> 00:28:09.119
Caption: this is a great time saver for me

00:28:07.319 --> 00:28:10.859
Caption: because I&#39;m just not picking up my phone

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:12.199
Caption: as much

00:28:10.859 --> 00:28:14.880
Caption: all right

00:28:12.199 --> 00:28:17.339
Caption: excuse me

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.719
Caption: now

00:28:17.339 --> 00:28:21.319
Caption: the next thing I&#39;m going to talk about

00:28:18.719 --> 00:28:23.640
Caption: was

00:28:21.319 --> 00:28:26.038
Caption: sorry the next thing I&#39;m going to talk

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:28.260
Caption: about is actually dealing with the

00:28:26.038 --> 00:28:29.699
Caption: internal triggers of distraction so you

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.039
Caption: can see the stuff that I&#39;ve talked about

00:28:29.699 --> 00:28:34.079
Caption: already is external triggers there&#39;s a

00:28:32.038 --> 00:28:36.058
Caption: little noise I&#39;m prompting to pick up my

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:38.640
Caption: phone but there are also internal

00:28:36.058 --> 00:28:40.859
Caption: triggers and for me they come up

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.260
Caption: in my moments of peak distractibility

00:28:40.859 --> 00:28:45.418
Caption: and they&#39;re all internal so it&#39;s like

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.678
Caption: I&#39;ve finished one task and I&#39;m going to

00:28:45.418 --> 00:28:48.538
Caption: start another

00:28:46.678 --> 00:28:51.619
Caption: and I&#39;m just going to pick up my phone

00:28:48.538 --> 00:28:53.219
Caption: and you know send a text

00:28:51.619 --> 00:28:55.219
Caption: I&#39;ve

00:28:53.219 --> 00:28:55.219
Caption: um

00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:01.400
Caption: finished a job that I was going to do

00:28:57.298 --> 00:29:01.399
Caption: and I feel like I need to reward myself

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.760
Caption: in those moments I&#39;m most susceptible to

00:29:04.199 --> 00:29:07.739
Caption: distractibility because I&#39;m not just

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.539
Caption: going to pick up this thing and look at

00:29:07.739 --> 00:29:12.000
Caption: it for a few seconds I&#39;m going to keep

00:29:09.538 --> 00:29:13.678
Caption: doing it one of the ones I do a lot of

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.479
Caption: the time is like when something is

00:29:13.678 --> 00:29:17.339
Caption: loading or I&#39;m waiting for a two-factor

00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:20.099
Caption: authentication something like that this

00:29:17.339 --> 00:29:21.839
Caption: is literally like a 10 second period but

00:29:20.099 --> 00:29:25.558
Caption: I can&#39;t go for those 10 seconds without

00:29:21.839 --> 00:29:28.079
Caption: being entertained I just can&#39;t

00:29:25.558 --> 00:29:30.778
Caption: so all these triggers I need a different

00:29:28.079 --> 00:29:33.298
Caption: approach to be able to

00:29:30.779 --> 00:29:35.100
Caption: deal with now the first thing I did was

00:29:33.298 --> 00:29:37.859
Caption: still configuring my tech

00:29:35.099 --> 00:29:40.140
Caption: and that was to disable Google discover

00:29:37.859 --> 00:29:41.640
Caption: do you all know what Google discover is

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.799
Caption: are you familiar with this it&#39;s it&#39;s

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.859
Caption: this thing

00:29:43.798 --> 00:29:48.599
Caption: this is a little screenshot of mine

00:29:46.859 --> 00:29:50.699
Caption: I haven&#39;t looked at the begonia yet I am

00:29:48.599 --> 00:29:53.219
Caption: still interested

00:29:50.699 --> 00:29:55.319
Caption: so this was a massive Vortex for me

00:29:53.219 --> 00:29:58.260
Caption: because actually Google is really good

00:29:55.319 --> 00:30:02.239
Caption: at knowing what I&#39;m into begonias

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.239
Caption: cat memes it&#39;s all good

00:30:02.339 --> 00:30:08.339
Caption: and the problem was that once I had

00:30:06.058 --> 00:30:11.099
Caption: disabled Reddit it was also popping up

00:30:08.339 --> 00:30:13.140
Caption: like a lot of well obviously cat memes

00:30:11.099 --> 00:30:14.760
Caption: but also a lot of like Agony art content

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.919
Caption: that I had previously been seeing on

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.599
Caption: Reddit and I ended up in a little bit of

00:30:16.918 --> 00:30:21.898
Caption: a spiral where I was actually reading

00:30:18.599 --> 00:30:23.880
Caption: like Reddit aita posts but just

00:30:21.899 --> 00:30:26.039
Caption: screenshotted on a Content aggregator

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.619
Caption: website

00:30:26.038 --> 00:30:31.798
Caption: which is just so I was like all right

00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:35.279
Caption: Google discover you&#39;ve got to go

00:30:31.798 --> 00:30:37.678
Caption: okay so I think I think at one point I

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:39.779
Caption: had looked at an article that one of my

00:30:37.678 --> 00:30:41.519
Caption: friends had posted and accidentally gave

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:43.679
Caption: it the impression that I care about

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.760
Caption: infant Health Care in any way which I

00:30:43.678 --> 00:30:47.158
Caption: don&#39;t

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.959
Caption: but apart from that it was nailing it

00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:50.880
Caption: with the cat memes the agony art stuff

00:30:48.959 --> 00:30:54.538
Caption: right so

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:56.459
Caption: what I did was to just disable it and it

00:30:54.538 --> 00:30:57.778
Caption: was a bit of a problem actually to try

00:30:56.459 --> 00:31:00.178
Caption: and do that because how it worked for me

00:30:57.779 --> 00:31:02.880
Caption: was just a single swipe from my home

00:31:00.178 --> 00:31:04.739
Caption: screen I had to Google quite deeply to

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.678
Caption: work out how to turn that functionality

00:31:04.739 --> 00:31:10.199
Caption: off but I managed it and once I&#39;d done

00:31:07.678 --> 00:31:11.640
Caption: it it was really noticeable just how

00:31:10.199 --> 00:31:14.398
Caption: many times a day I reached for it

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.899
Caption: because I would swipe and I&#39;d do it a

00:31:14.399 --> 00:31:18.899
Caption: couple of times because it hadn&#39;t worked

00:31:15.899 --> 00:31:21.179
Caption: and then I&#39;d be like Oh I&#39;m doing that

00:31:18.899 --> 00:31:23.299
Caption: thing again

00:31:21.178 --> 00:31:26.158
Caption: and the interesting thing about this is

00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:28.979
Caption: like before this content is actually

00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:31.980
Caption: available to me at any time if I open a

00:31:28.979 --> 00:31:34.380
Caption: new blank tab in Chrome it&#39;s just there

00:31:31.979 --> 00:31:38.339
Caption: that&#39;s the default Behavior but because

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:39.479
Caption: I broke the little reflex of swiping it

00:31:38.339 --> 00:31:41.520
Caption: also

00:31:39.479 --> 00:31:44.298
Caption: delivered a pretty big hit to the mental

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.299
Caption: part of it as well

00:31:44.699 --> 00:31:49.260
Caption: now unfortunately

00:31:47.219 --> 00:31:51.058
Caption: just disabling this one app is not

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:53.579
Caption: enough to deal completely with my

00:31:51.058 --> 00:31:56.640
Caption: internal triggers of distraction I also

00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:59.158
Caption: needed a strategy to be able to do that

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.919
Caption: so the first thing is I&#39;m going to have

00:31:59.159 --> 00:32:03.539
Caption: to notice the trigger and ideally has to

00:32:01.918 --> 00:32:06.119
Caption: be in the moment you can kind of do it

00:32:03.538 --> 00:32:07.619
Caption: as a retrospective like all right I just

00:32:06.119 --> 00:32:09.658
Caption: put my phone down after looking at it

00:32:07.619 --> 00:32:11.640
Caption: for 10 minutes when I was just

00:32:09.659 --> 00:32:12.779
Caption: waiting for two-factor authentication

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.459
Caption: whoops

00:32:12.779 --> 00:32:16.440
Caption: but it&#39;s better if you notice it at the

00:32:14.459 --> 00:32:18.599
Caption: time you&#39;re doing it and for me

00:32:16.439 --> 00:32:20.398
Caption: disabling Google discover was a really

00:32:18.599 --> 00:32:22.500
Caption: good thing for this because like I said

00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:24.779
Caption: super noticeable when I tried to do it

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.699
Caption: and it didn&#39;t work

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:28.260
Caption: now the second step

00:32:26.699 --> 00:32:29.760
Caption: is that I&#39;m going to explore the

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.520
Caption: feelings I&#39;m not going to judge myself

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:34.260
Caption: and be like oh you&#39;re a bad person what

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.520
Caption: I&#39;m going to do is just think about it

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:37.739
Caption: for a while

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.020
Caption: get curious wonder why I&#39;m wanting to be

00:32:37.739 --> 00:32:41.520
Caption: distracted and as before with my

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.580
Caption: procrastination when I&#39;m thinking about

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.899
Caption: why I want to procrastinate

00:32:44.579 --> 00:32:49.678
Caption: it is

00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:52.200
Caption: easier for me to understand and sit in

00:32:49.678 --> 00:32:54.719
Caption: the moment if I&#39;ve interrogated a little

00:32:52.199 --> 00:32:56.639
Caption: bit it&#39;s kind of like Wagner&#39;s second

00:32:54.719 --> 00:32:58.020
Caption: group of people maybe first group of

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.000
Caption: people the people who are allowed to

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:02.039
Caption: think about the bear the whole time I&#39;m

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.619
Caption: not going to be rebounding

00:33:02.038 --> 00:33:06.538
Caption: because I&#39;m allowing myself to think

00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:08.579
Caption: about it I&#39;m not trying to suppress that

00:33:06.538 --> 00:33:10.439
Caption: thought

00:33:08.579 --> 00:33:11.939
Caption: the third thing

00:33:10.439 --> 00:33:14.459
Caption: is that I&#39;m just going to wait for 10

00:33:11.939 --> 00:33:15.538
Caption: minutes so this is like making a low bar

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:18.479
Caption: commitment to yourself with

00:33:15.538 --> 00:33:20.759
Caption: procrastination you just say I&#39;m gonna

00:33:18.479 --> 00:33:21.599
Caption: wait for 10 minutes it&#39;s super easy to

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.099
Caption: do

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:24.839
Caption: but actually

00:33:23.099 --> 00:33:26.939
Caption: once you&#39;ve noticed a trigger and you&#39;ve

00:33:24.839 --> 00:33:28.918
Caption: explored the feelings then the waiting

00:33:26.939 --> 00:33:30.359
Caption: is usually enough of a period to help

00:33:28.918 --> 00:33:33.119
Caption: you cool off

00:33:30.359 --> 00:33:36.119
Caption: right and you kind of know that you&#39;re

00:33:33.119 --> 00:33:38.279
Caption: not supposed to be getting distracted so

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:40.739
Caption: it allows you to

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:42.720
Caption: sit with those feelings but not have to

00:33:40.739 --> 00:33:44.099
Caption: feel guilty about them because you&#39;ve

00:33:42.719 --> 00:33:46.739
Caption: already made this bargain with yourself

00:33:44.099 --> 00:33:49.018
Caption: if I wait for 10 minutes I still want to

00:33:46.739 --> 00:33:51.359
Caption: do the thing after I&#39;m allowed to do the

00:33:49.019 --> 00:33:53.220
Caption: thing I don&#39;t have to feel guilty when I

00:33:51.359 --> 00:33:55.558
Caption: do the thing because I already gave

00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:58.038
Caption: myself permission I&#39;ve already worked

00:33:55.558 --> 00:33:58.038
Caption: through that

00:33:59.959 --> 00:34:04.558
Caption: excuse me

00:34:02.219 --> 00:34:07.500
Caption: all right now I just want to talk

00:34:04.558 --> 00:34:09.239
Caption: specifically about distractions at work

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.158
Caption: because I think they look a little bit

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:12.959
Caption: different to how distractions in your

00:34:11.158 --> 00:34:16.500
Caption: personal life work

00:34:12.959 --> 00:34:18.479
Caption: at work a lot of my distractions kind of

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.878
Caption: look a lot like plain old work because

00:34:18.479 --> 00:34:23.699
Caption: that&#39;s mostly what they are they&#39;re

00:34:20.878 --> 00:34:26.279
Caption: often a small task that&#39;s come in

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:28.398
Caption: it&#39;s often pretty urgent it&#39;s often

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.898
Caption: something that is low impact or low

00:34:28.398 --> 00:34:33.118
Caption: importance it&#39;s not usually the big

00:34:30.898 --> 00:34:35.338
Caption: strategic stuff that I&#39;m really trying

00:34:33.118 --> 00:34:37.618
Caption: to work towards

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:39.599
Caption: and because distraction is just as

00:34:37.618 --> 00:34:42.059
Caption: sneaky as procrastination

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:44.280
Caption: we think to ourselves oh yeah that is

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:47.639
Caption: important I will just do that thing

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:49.439
Caption: and where you end up is in this cycle of

00:34:47.638 --> 00:34:51.898
Caption: churning stuff through

00:34:49.439 --> 00:34:53.520
Caption: and switching tasks frequently

00:34:51.898 --> 00:34:55.618
Caption: now

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:58.800
Caption: the reason this is a problem for me is

00:34:55.618 --> 00:35:01.260
Caption: because I am easily distracted so if

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.599
Caption: someone sends me an email my instinct is

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.239
Caption: to jump on what they do what they sent

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:07.920
Caption: to me and do it straight away okay

00:35:06.239 --> 00:35:10.979
Caption: so my problem at work was pretty much

00:35:07.919 --> 00:35:14.040
Caption: similar to in my personal life it was

00:35:10.979 --> 00:35:15.300
Caption: notifications notifications and

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.719
Caption: notifications

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:21.300
Caption: because at work we have email obviously

00:35:18.719 --> 00:35:24.358
Caption: we have slack within our web team

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:25.979
Caption: we have Asana for our broader

00:35:24.358 --> 00:35:28.559
Caption: Communications team so get task

00:35:25.979 --> 00:35:30.358
Caption: notifications and then we use teams for

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.339
Caption: the whole organization and anyone can

00:35:30.358 --> 00:35:34.259
Caption: talk to me through that it&#39;s a lot of

00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:36.540
Caption: noise every day

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:38.280
Caption: so as with my phone

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:40.679
Caption: I changed this up by just turning all

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:43.320
Caption: these off so I now check it probably

00:35:40.679 --> 00:35:46.260
Caption: like three to five times a day check all

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:49.560
Caption: of those channels and apart from that I

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:51.300
Caption: have Outlook closed because if you just

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.040
Caption: turn off the notifications you can still

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:55.679
Caption: see there&#39;s a new email

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.839
Caption: I explicitly have to quit teams in the

00:35:55.679 --> 00:36:00.000
Caption: system tray because if you just close it

00:35:57.839 --> 00:36:02.820
Caption: it looks like it&#39;s closed but if you get

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.760
Caption: a notification it pops up

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:08.339
Caption: and then I have slack muted and then

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.959
Caption: closed because if you just close it you

00:36:08.339 --> 00:36:12.480
Caption: can still see a little notification

00:36:09.959 --> 00:36:15.419
Caption: badge and you can see what I was talking

00:36:12.479 --> 00:36:18.540
Caption: about before with this

00:36:15.419 --> 00:36:20.760
Caption: um apps trying to hook us in right

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.679
Caption: I had to be quite ingenious with all

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:26.359
Caption: these things to try and stop them from

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:26.358
Caption: being able to reach me and distract me

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:33.739
Caption: um

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.739
Caption: sorry

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.719
Caption: as for Asana what I did with that was I

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:44.220
Caption: turned off the notifications in slack so

00:36:42.719 --> 00:36:46.560
Caption: we had an integration it would send you

00:36:44.219 --> 00:36:50.159
Caption: a message every time that happened

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.780
Caption: and then I set up a rule in my email to

00:36:50.159 --> 00:36:53.639
Caption: send all of the notifications to a

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.919
Caption: folder that I never look at so there&#39;s

00:36:53.639 --> 00:36:58.739
Caption: now

00:36:54.919 --> 00:37:01.379
Caption: 1166 unread emails in that folder I&#39;m

00:36:58.739 --> 00:37:03.179
Caption: pretty proud of that thank you

00:37:01.379 --> 00:37:05.759
Caption: and the reason I didn&#39;t just disable

00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:07.618
Caption: them entirely is because asana&#39;s kind of

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.719
Caption: hard to use sometimes and sometimes that

00:37:07.618 --> 00:37:11.639
Caption: is the best way of finding something

00:37:09.719 --> 00:37:12.899
Caption: specific that I&#39;m looking for so I

00:37:11.639 --> 00:37:14.519
Caption: didn&#39;t want to get rid of the emails

00:37:12.899 --> 00:37:17.399
Caption: altogether but I don&#39;t want them

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:20.640
Caption: cluttering up my inbox

00:37:17.399 --> 00:37:23.639
Caption: so does this seem pretty extreme

00:37:20.639 --> 00:37:26.098
Caption: it kind of seemed extreme to me when I

00:37:23.639 --> 00:37:28.019
Caption: was first doing it so one of the key

00:37:26.099 --> 00:37:32.400
Caption: things was to manage other people&#39;s

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:34.800
Caption: expectations so this is my leader our

00:37:32.399 --> 00:37:36.779
Caption: unit manager everyone else in the web

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.239
Caption: team and then a couple of other people

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.979
Caption: that I support frequently I told them

00:37:39.239 --> 00:37:42.598
Caption: that if they needed to get me urgently

00:37:40.979 --> 00:37:45.540
Caption: then they should pick up the phone and

00:37:42.599 --> 00:37:48.000
Caption: call me and otherwise you can try your

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:49.380
Caption: luck at any time but I might not respond

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.540
Caption: straight away

00:37:49.379 --> 00:37:54.118
Caption: and actually it did raise a few eyebrows

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:56.880
Caption: people were a bit like

00:37:54.118 --> 00:37:59.719
Caption: so you&#39;re just not gonna let people talk

00:37:56.879 --> 00:37:59.719
Caption: to you about work

00:37:59.939 --> 00:38:04.139
Caption: but actually as it turns out people

00:38:02.339 --> 00:38:07.140
Caption: rarely ever notice that I&#39;m offline for

00:38:04.139 --> 00:38:10.578
Caption: most of the day and nobody has ever

00:38:07.139 --> 00:38:10.578
Caption: picked up the phone to call me

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.839
Caption: it seemed pretty daunting to me when I

00:38:14.219 --> 00:38:18.300
Caption: was first doing it and I think that was

00:38:15.839 --> 00:38:21.060
Caption: because I was in this always on always

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:24.560
Caption: available mindset

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.560
Caption: which I think a lot of us are right

00:38:25.139 --> 00:38:30.539
Caption: but it causes no inconvenience to anyone

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:31.920
Caption: else and it does make me a lot more

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.959
Caption: effective at work

00:38:31.919 --> 00:38:35.879
Caption: because like I said

00:38:33.959 --> 00:38:37.979
Caption: I&#39;m pretty easily distracted I will jump

00:38:35.879 --> 00:38:40.139
Caption: on the nearest thing that came in

00:38:37.979 --> 00:38:42.358
Caption: and then also because it stops me from

00:38:40.139 --> 00:38:43.739
Caption: task switching so frequently

00:38:42.358 --> 00:38:45.959
Caption: and now this is where we&#39;re going to

00:38:43.739 --> 00:38:48.060
Caption: come back to why does it matter if I

00:38:45.959 --> 00:38:49.618
Caption: take 30 seconds out of my day to reply

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:52.920
Caption: to that email

00:38:49.618 --> 00:38:55.260
Caption: the reason it matters is because with

00:38:52.919 --> 00:38:58.139
Caption: frequent task switching you&#39;re actually

00:38:55.260 --> 00:39:00.300
Caption: raising your cognitive load okay so

00:38:58.139 --> 00:39:02.098
Caption: cognitive load means it&#39;s going to be

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.260
Caption: harder for you to focus back on your

00:39:02.099 --> 00:39:06.420
Caption: first task your brain is going to be

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:10.199
Caption: more tired and you&#39;re also going to be

00:39:06.419 --> 00:39:12.540
Caption: much more likely to make a mistake

00:39:10.199 --> 00:39:15.780
Caption: and that&#39;s a problem because I was doing

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:18.380
Caption: a lot of task switching

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:20.699
Caption: I think being at work can feel like

00:39:18.379 --> 00:39:22.618
Caption: sharing out a single bucket of water

00:39:20.699 --> 00:39:24.659
Caption: amongst all the fires

00:39:22.618 --> 00:39:26.519
Caption: that are surrounding you

00:39:24.659 --> 00:39:28.319
Caption: and you give them all just enough to

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:32.239
Caption: kind of keep them under control but it&#39;s

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.239
Caption: not enough to douse them usually

00:39:32.339 --> 00:39:38.720
Caption: and you end up task switching a lot

00:39:34.439 --> 00:39:38.719
Caption: because you need to put out your fires

00:39:44.339 --> 00:39:48.359
Caption: now

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:50.699
Caption: to address this problem which I was

00:39:48.358 --> 00:39:53.519
Caption: having a lot

00:39:50.699 --> 00:39:56.159
Caption: I further switched up my day I&#39;m going

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.599
Caption: to show you now my task tracking

00:39:56.159 --> 00:40:00.719
Caption: software

00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:02.940
Caption: and this is what it looked like before

00:40:00.719 --> 00:40:04.439
Caption: I started doing all this stuff so you

00:40:02.939 --> 00:40:06.300
Caption: can see here

00:40:04.439 --> 00:40:07.139
Caption: I&#39;m doing I mean Tuesday was pretty good

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.839
Caption: actually

00:40:07.139 --> 00:40:11.760
Caption: yay Tuesday but like Wednesday was a

00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:13.440
Caption: complete mess and these are all the

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.780
Caption: tasks I&#39;m doing I&#39;m doing like 11

00:40:13.439 --> 00:40:18.540
Caption: minutes 25 minutes 26 minutes 17 minutes

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:20.219
Caption: 22 minutes is because I&#39;m still

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.199
Caption: available to anyone and everyone at this

00:40:20.219 --> 00:40:24.479
Caption: time so I&#39;m getting emails in and

00:40:22.199 --> 00:40:28.199
Caption: replying to them I&#39;m getting teams

00:40:24.479 --> 00:40:31.199
Caption: things I&#39;m also in the mindset of I&#39;ll

00:40:28.199 --> 00:40:33.300
Caption: just get that out the way

00:40:31.199 --> 00:40:35.879
Caption: right because I&#39;ve got a load of like

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.920
Caption: very small tasks they&#39;re very minor I

00:40:35.879 --> 00:40:39.299
Caption: can get those done really quickly and

00:40:37.919 --> 00:40:41.879
Caption: then I&#39;ll get on with the rest of my day

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:44.219
Caption: and actually what you can see here is

00:40:41.879 --> 00:40:45.899
Caption: that I&#39;m mostly not getting on with the

00:40:44.219 --> 00:40:47.939
Caption: rest of my day

00:40:45.899 --> 00:40:50.098
Caption: I&#39;m ending up

00:40:47.939 --> 00:40:52.739
Caption: not being able to focus really even that

00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:54.720
Caption: well in the afternoon either I&#39;m doing I

00:40:52.739 --> 00:40:56.820
Caption: mean especially Wednesday

00:40:54.719 --> 00:40:58.739
Caption: what a problem but then all the rest of

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:00.540
Caption: them I&#39;m still you know kind of managing

00:40:58.739 --> 00:41:02.639
Caption: maybe an hour-ish a little bit more than

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:06.000
Caption: an hour and you can see where I&#39;m most

00:41:02.639 --> 00:41:08.819
Caption: effective is after 4pm on Friday and

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.079
Caption: that&#39;s because nobody could talk to me

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.180
Caption: and

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:14.099
Caption: I&#39;m working well and truly past six

00:41:12.179 --> 00:41:15.598
Caption: because I have a lot of stuff that I

00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:17.700
Caption: didn&#39;t get to do this week because I was

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:18.780
Caption: doing all this other little crappy stuff

00:41:17.699 --> 00:41:21.540
Caption: okay

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:23.339
Caption: so here&#39;s what it looked like after I

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:25.619
Caption: started implementing this so you can see

00:41:23.339 --> 00:41:27.180
Caption: I&#39;ve still got mostly quite a smallish

00:41:25.618 --> 00:41:29.578
Caption: task up front

00:41:27.179 --> 00:41:32.159
Caption: and that&#39;s me doing my emails checking

00:41:29.579 --> 00:41:33.420
Caption: teams checking slack replying to

00:41:32.159 --> 00:41:36.539
Caption: anything that needs a bit of back and

00:41:33.419 --> 00:41:39.059
Caption: forth and then I&#39;m also going into Asana

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:41.160
Caption: and planning my day and then I&#39;m jumping

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:43.320
Caption: straight into the meaty stuff

00:41:41.159 --> 00:41:45.479
Caption: I&#39;m focusing for much longer periods of

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:47.940
Caption: time and then when I come back after

00:41:45.479 --> 00:41:49.800
Caption: lunch you can see on some of the days

00:41:47.939 --> 00:41:51.239
Caption: like Monday I&#39;m still doing the little

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.520
Caption: tasks

00:41:51.239 --> 00:41:56.098
Caption: but on other days I&#39;m doing a lot more

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.679
Caption: focus in the afternoon as well so it&#39;s

00:41:56.099 --> 00:42:00.000
Caption: like I&#39;m still surrounded by fires but

00:41:58.679 --> 00:42:02.399
Caption: actually now I&#39;m just letting them burn

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.959
Caption: and it turns out

00:42:02.399 --> 00:42:06.479
Caption: I didn&#39;t need to give them as much

00:42:03.959 --> 00:42:08.280
Caption: attention as I was they actually coped

00:42:06.479 --> 00:42:09.358
Caption: just as well being left alone for a

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:12.179
Caption: while

00:42:09.358 --> 00:42:14.939
Caption: the last thing I&#39;m going to finish with

00:42:12.179 --> 00:42:16.618
Caption: is a little bit of my Asana so this is

00:42:14.939 --> 00:42:19.679
Caption: the six months before this is how many

00:42:16.618 --> 00:42:22.139
Caption: tasks I did for context a task for us is

00:42:19.679 --> 00:42:24.300
Caption: anything from like 15 minutes to four

00:42:22.139 --> 00:42:27.000
Caption: weeks so it varies quite a lot

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:29.459
Caption: I&#39;d say probably 60 of the tasks are

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.439
Caption: probably one to six hours right

00:42:29.459 --> 00:42:35.098
Caption: so in the six months before I&#39;ve done

00:42:31.439 --> 00:42:37.078
Caption: 187 tasks this is about one and a

00:42:35.099 --> 00:42:39.420
Caption: quarter tasks per day which is I don&#39;t

00:42:37.079 --> 00:42:41.820
Caption: know seems kind of okay I&#39;m not sure

00:42:39.419 --> 00:42:43.799
Caption: this is the six months after so it&#39;s

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:45.660
Caption: gone up like a little bit but actually

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.520
Caption: this encompasses the period that I was

00:42:45.659 --> 00:42:51.780
Caption: on leave for over Christmas so actually

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:54.959
Caption: now my daily rate is now 1.93 which is a

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:57.000
Caption: lot better than 1.25 go at me but I was

00:42:54.959 --> 00:42:57.659
Caption: still kind of refining my process at the

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.118
Caption: time

00:42:57.659 --> 00:43:03.299
Caption: so in the four months since then

00:43:00.118 --> 00:43:05.098
Caption: I&#39;ve now done 246 so I&#39;ve done more

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:08.459
Caption: tasks in four months than I did in six

00:43:05.099 --> 00:43:09.420
Caption: months and I&#39;m now up to 2.93 tasks per

00:43:08.459 --> 00:43:11.699
Caption: day

00:43:09.419 --> 00:43:13.139
Caption: which is more than double what it was

00:43:11.699 --> 00:43:15.239
Caption: before

00:43:13.139 --> 00:43:16.760
Caption: I&#39;m pretty impressed by it I hadn&#39;t

00:43:15.239 --> 00:43:19.079
Caption: actually I think

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.118
Caption: [Applause]

00:43:19.079 --> 00:43:22.619
Caption: I hadn&#39;t actually looked at stats before

00:43:21.118 --> 00:43:25.679
Caption: doing this talk I was just kind of going

00:43:22.618 --> 00:43:27.838
Caption: with like the vibe feels more productive

00:43:25.679 --> 00:43:31.338
Caption: I think I&#39;m getting more done turns out

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:31.339
Caption: I was getting more done go me

00:43:31.379 --> 00:43:35.279
Caption: so I&#39;m just going to finish up by

00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:37.800
Caption: telling you what I think the key

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.659
Caption: takeaways are so

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.540
Caption: I think understanding the reasons we

00:43:39.659 --> 00:43:45.118
Caption: procrastinate and looking into it helps

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:48.000
Caption: us to choose the best technique to

00:43:45.118 --> 00:43:49.500
Caption: overcome procrastination

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.179
Caption: distraction

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.979
Caption: can stop us from doing the things that

00:43:51.179 --> 00:43:55.078
Caption: are really important to us whether it&#39;s

00:43:52.979 --> 00:43:56.579
Caption: deploying a new feature or letting the

00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:59.460
Caption: people we care about know that we&#39;re

00:43:56.579 --> 00:44:01.140
Caption: fully present when we&#39;re with them

00:43:59.459 --> 00:44:03.719
Caption: we can deal with a lot of the external

00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:05.939
Caption: triggers of distraction by just

00:44:03.719 --> 00:44:08.520
Caption: configuring our Tech we can deal with

00:44:05.939 --> 00:44:11.098
Caption: the internal triggers not by suppressing

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:14.339
Caption: our thoughts which can lead to rebound

00:44:11.099 --> 00:44:16.260
Caption: but by being Mindful and sitting in our

00:44:14.339 --> 00:44:19.319
Caption: feelings in the moment

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:20.880
Caption: and you might get a bit of pushback if

00:44:19.319 --> 00:44:23.520
Caption: you try and configure this stuff at work

00:44:20.879 --> 00:44:27.118
Caption: but ultimately the results you&#39;re going

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:29.090
Caption: to get are going to be pretty good

00:44:27.118 --> 00:44:39.269
Caption: and that&#39;s all thank you for coming

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:39.270
Caption: [Applause]
