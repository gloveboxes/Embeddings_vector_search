00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:08.638
Caption: good afternoon my name is david martin

00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:10.638
Caption: and i&#39;m talking today about extra asx

00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:12.479
Caption: trading versus machine learning ml ops

00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:13.678
Caption: by accident

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.518
Caption: first though i&#39;d like to say thanks to

00:00:13.678 --> 00:00:19.118
Caption: the sponsors for allowing us to have

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.720
Caption: this conference it&#39;s a great opportunity

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:22.399
Caption: so the other thing i&#39;d like to open with

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:24.799
Caption: is this is not financial advice please

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:26.719
Caption: don&#39;t rush out get a comsec account and

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:28.840
Caption: blow next month&#39;s rate rent or your

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:32.319
Caption: mortgage i&#39;ll get in trouble for

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.078
Caption: that so why why am i here

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:37.119
Caption: for me my machine learning journey

00:00:34.078 --> 00:00:38.718
Caption: started with the new york city taxi fare

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:40.558
Caption: prediction project

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.600
Caption: so i found that on the microsoft website

00:00:40.558 --> 00:00:45.519
Caption: back in late 2019 and what it let me do

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:47.199
Caption: was it lets me um

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.680
Caption: experience machine learning with c-sharp

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.120
Caption: in a very easy uh and comfortable way

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.439
Caption: and

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:55.840
Caption: a taxi fare is an easy thing to predict

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:58.558
Caption: it&#39;s the name of the taxi company the

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.879
Caption: distance traveled

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:02.799
Caption: time of day so and so forth and what i

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.040
Caption: could see from that without teaching the

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.639
Caption: code

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.400
Caption: anything at all it could read this data

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:09.919
Caption: file and make predictions from it so

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.360
Caption: straight away i could see

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:13.279
Caption: i was interested i was interested by the

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.119
Caption: subject but also that code could learn

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:16.639
Caption: something and so i was quite fascinated

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.000
Caption: by that

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.158
Caption: the thing was

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.680
Caption: in my experience that project was it was

00:01:20.158 --> 00:01:23.199
Caption: i was hard coded so every time i wanted

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.720
Caption: to add a new feature remove a feature

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:27.360
Caption: make an alteration i had to change the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.159
Caption: code and recompile and i wondered

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.000
Caption: if there was a way to

00:01:30.158 --> 00:01:32.798
Caption: dynamically change it so i could upload

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.959
Caption: any

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.680
Caption: data sets with different features and

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:40.959
Caption: data points and see if it could just

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.839
Caption: test it and use it and predict from it

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.599
Caption: so

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:44.798
Caption: what i ended up doing was i end up

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.478
Caption: building a tool for myself and i&#39;ve

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.200
Caption: called it data shark

00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:50.879
Caption: what it let me do was create data files

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:52.478
Caption: upload them and it didn&#39;t know in

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:53.519
Caption: advance what they were it could go

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:56.959
Caption: through

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:58.959
Caption: and test all the permutations of of data

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.118
Caption: and

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.879
Caption: machine learning parameters and find the

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.479
Caption: most optimized solution for me so it

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:06.839
Caption: could test hundreds and thousands of

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:08.878
Caption: models for hours completely

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:10.238
Caption: automatically so once i&#39;d achieved that

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:11.598
Caption: i was quite satisfied with it i tested

00:02:10.238 --> 00:02:12.800
Caption: it with healthcare data i&#39;m from the

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:15.199
Caption: healthcare sector i&#39;ve been public

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.800
Caption: health now for about 17 odd years

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.399
Caption: i test on a variety of models cancer

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.080
Caption: models breast cancer that sort of thing

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:21.919
Caption: and i found

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.958
Caption: uh i was happy with it but it wasn&#39;t

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:27.520
Caption: really um as successful i hoped

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.360
Caption: so i decided to pivot to fintech which

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.958
Caption: is a passion of mine i&#39;ve

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.199
Caption: studied in finance financial planning so

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:35.518
Caption: i thought i&#39;d combine iot with finance

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.958
Caption: and go into asx trading and see if i

00:02:35.518 --> 00:02:39.039
Caption: could use machine learning and try and

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:41.279
Caption: work out the features that i needed to

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:44.639
Caption: be able to predict a trade in advance

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:47.360
Caption: which brings me to today

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.039
Caption: so my agenda for this talk is the first

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.720
Caption: part of it is my trading strategy what

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:53.119
Caption: trading strategy was i going to use or

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.878
Caption: model in machine learning

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.238
Caption: the second component i want to cover

00:02:54.878 --> 00:02:57.598
Caption: today is machine learning in a minute i

00:02:56.238 --> 00:02:59.199
Caption: just want to cover some quick

00:02:57.598 --> 00:03:00.559
Caption: calculations and

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.319
Caption: just so you have an appreciation of how

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.119
Caption: it all fits together

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.279
Caption: and

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.720
Caption: the key part of the talk is ml ops or

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.679
Caption: machine learning operations and that&#39;s

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.279
Caption: how

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:11.039
Caption: having these hundreds of thousands of

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.479
Caption: models how i deploy them destroy them

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:14.399
Caption: how they&#39;re used at scale and

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:17.518
Caption: automatically because after all my one

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:19.279
Caption: man band and at the end if this time a

00:03:17.518 --> 00:03:20.559
Caption: a quick anecdote about my experience so

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.199
Caption: far

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:25.279
Caption: so let&#39;s start asx

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:27.039
Caption: so i have my own self-managed super fund

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:28.878
Caption: and part of my

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.319
Caption: need is to automate that trading look

00:03:28.878 --> 00:03:31.919
Caption: for opportunities and trade them

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.639
Caption: automatically if possible at the very

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.720
Caption: least bring them to my attention

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.720
Caption: just like everyone else busy person with

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.158
Caption: things to do

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.759
Caption: the first thing to consider with share

00:03:40.158 --> 00:03:43.440
Caption: trading is it&#39;s

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:45.518
Caption: shares are not traded in fact it&#39;s

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.360
Caption: information and sentiment it&#39;s how you

00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:49.518
Caption: feel how people feel about a company you

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.039
Caption: may feel more comfortable buying say cba

00:03:49.518 --> 00:03:52.479
Caption: shares versus

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:54.878
Caption: a small startup you may not have heard

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.958
Caption: of before or seen on twitter somewhere

00:03:54.878 --> 00:04:00.238
Caption: so it&#39;s important to remember that

00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:02.000
Caption: information and sentiment is what drives

00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:03.279
Caption: trading behavior the buying and selling

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.438
Caption: of shares

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:07.919
Caption: and because sentiment or emotion drives

00:04:05.438 --> 00:04:10.158
Caption: trading um for for a lot of people then

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.679
Caption: volatility which is emotion based equals

00:04:10.158 --> 00:04:14.639
Caption: opportunity

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:16.798
Caption: so what that meant was i had to find a

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.919
Caption: an event a repeatable reliable event i

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.559
Caption: could use and try and predict when that

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.880
Caption: event would be successful in a trade so

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:27.440
Caption: in my particular case or the strategy i

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.440
Caption: formed was around asx announcements asx

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.000
Caption: announcements are documents that

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.759
Caption: accompanies obliged to notify the market

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.679
Caption: of certain events good and good news and

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.519
Caption: bad news

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:40.000
Caption: and so my strategy

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:40.839
Caption: the strategy that i developed or devised

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.160
Caption: was

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:47.040
Caption: to predict when an asx announcement from

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.440
Caption: a company would move the share price up

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.839
Caption: by a certain amount so let&#39;s say 10 15

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.279
Caption: percent well let&#39;s say 15

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:55.279
Caption: and then that way we can turn that into

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:58.320
Caption: a binary machine learning model did it

00:04:55.279 --> 00:05:00.639
Caption: move over 15 or did it not and so that

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.720
Caption: way we can attack

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.520
Caption: the trading strategy by using binary

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.880
Caption: classification and machine learning

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:10.799
Caption: which brings me to the next part data

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.759
Caption: so data as i said they&#39;re making the

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:15.198
Caption: model so the data that i&#39;ve considered

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.559
Caption: when supporting

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.880
Caption: these decisions these machine learning

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:20.320
Caption: models is announcement metadata the time

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.839
Caption: of day

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.000
Caption: the day of the week the month of the

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.440
Caption: year so and so forth season if you

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.359
Caption: wanted to these are all things i&#39;ve

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.119
Caption: factored and experimented with before

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:31.439
Caption: the title of the document the company

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:32.880
Caption: came from are all valid choices as

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.479
Caption: features

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.720
Caption: the other thing i experimented with was

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.919
Caption: uh sentiment so there&#39;s microservice

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.160
Caption: available from ibm azure google that you

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.000
Caption: can do sentiment scoring and i did that

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.759
Caption: on the asx announcement titles and used

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.359
Caption: that as a feature as well in my my

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.799
Caption: modeling

00:05:47.359 --> 00:05:50.799
Caption: another thing to consider i talked about

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:52.239
Caption: sentiment before so twitter twitter

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:54.319
Caption: twitter&#39;s a great place for our day

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:56.160
Caption: traders news articles regularly

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.839
Caption: published a few hundred a day during the

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.919
Caption: trading week the volume of those

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:01.359
Caption: announcements the sentiment of those uh

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.919
Caption: statements themselves they&#39;re good or

00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:06.239
Caption: bad and capturing those can help

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.039
Caption: determine the uh the volatility of the

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:10.239
Caption: movement of a stock

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.639
Caption: another good example you&#39;ve probably

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:13.839
Caption: seen the tv is economic indicators

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.360
Caption: inflation data you&#39;ve probably heard

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:17.440
Caption: about jobs numbers you&#39;ve heard about

00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:18.959
Caption: rba interest decision which affects a

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.720
Caption: lot of us with mortgages

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:23.199
Caption: those are all good features and factors

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.519
Caption: that i&#39;ve considered before in my models

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.440
Caption: the other thing to consider is trading

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:28.959
Caption: data derivatives so moving averages are

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.720
Caption: very common you&#39;ll see them if anyone

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:33.600
Caption: has a trading account five-day moving

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.199
Caption: average 20-day moving average 1500 so

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.800
Caption: and so forth so those things i&#39;ve

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.399
Caption: considered my modeling also short

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:40.159
Caption: positions um

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:42.160
Caption: if you&#39;re feeling the movie big short or

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.239
Caption: any of those things it that also drives

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.239
Caption: sentiment you can see what other people

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:48.479
Caption: believe if the company&#39;s gonna go up or

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:50.399
Caption: down

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:52.800
Caption: next thing i&#39;d like to cover is machine

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:54.319
Caption: learning in a minute

00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:56.559
Caption: the first particular calculation is

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:57.759
Caption: confusion matrix now confusion matrix

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:59.039
Caption: i&#39;ve written there is a performance

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.119
Caption: measurement for machine learning

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:03.119
Caption: classification problems where the apple

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:04.799
Caption: can be one or more two classes in my

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:07.119
Caption: case it&#39;s a binary classification

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:09.039
Caption: problem so it&#39;s very simple true false

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:11.039
Caption: as you can see from the sample confusion

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.000
Caption: matrix i&#39;ve got there the predicted

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.679
Caption: positive

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.839
Caption: is where the machine learning model has

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:17.440
Caption: predicted that it&#39;s going to happen now

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:19.519
Caption: on the left hand side you can see actual

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.839
Caption: positive now actual positive is where in

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:23.759
Caption: fact the machine said yes and it did

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:25.679
Caption: happen the next one below the actual

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:28.399
Caption: negative is where the machine said yes

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:28.399
Caption: but it didn&#39;t happen

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.919
Caption: moving on from there is precision now

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:34.880
Caption: specifically with

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.080
Caption: um

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.919
Caption: precision it&#39;s important that

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:39.198
Caption: left-handed column is all the trades we

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.039
Caption: would make because we don&#39;t know in

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:43.119
Caption: advance whether or not the trade is

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:45.519
Caption: going to be successful or unsuccessful

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:47.359
Caption: and that is the price moves more than 15

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:49.759
Caption: and achieves our objective

00:07:47.359 --> 00:07:51.598
Caption: so in order to measure a model&#39;s uh

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:52.720
Caption: accuracy while it&#39;s being trained and

00:07:51.598 --> 00:07:54.319
Caption: tested

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.679
Caption: we use the calculation called precision

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:57.279
Caption: and you can see i put a sample there

00:07:55.679 --> 00:07:59.519
Caption: using the numbers from the previous

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:01.279
Caption: confusion matrix so true positive on the

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:03.279
Caption: top and the true positive false positive

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:04.720
Caption: on the bottom so as you can see from the

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:06.799
Caption: score there point to weight

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.559
Caption: approximately 28 percent

00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:10.799
Caption: so the question asks is it a good model

00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:12.720
Caption: to trade with and the answer is no

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:14.478
Caption: what it&#39;s saying there is 28 of your

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.399
Caption: trades would be success which means

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:18.319
Caption: approximately 70 wouldn&#39;t be and there&#39;s

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:20.079
Caption: a good chance you&#39;re losing money now

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:22.000
Caption: the the thing that&#39;s important to point

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:23.279
Caption: out here is that at a 15 target the

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.679
Caption: share price could have gone up five or

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:27.759
Caption: ten percent but not our goal of 15 so

00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:30.319
Caption: it&#39;s still considered a fail

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:32.479
Caption: or not a good trade

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:34.958
Caption: so moving on from there ml ops the

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:37.119
Caption: necessary accident the situation i had

00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.559
Caption: was the the tool i built was building

00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:40.880
Caption: thousands hundreds of thousands of

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:42.640
Caption: models how could i determine the good

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.239
Caption: ones to send out and deploy to

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.359
Caption: production and test

00:08:44.239 --> 00:08:48.479
Caption: and then equally dispose of them and the

00:08:47.359 --> 00:08:49.919
Caption: need

00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:51.440
Caption: was to automate all of that i&#39;m a

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:53.440
Caption: one-man band and there&#39;s hundreds of

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.599
Caption: thousands of models i couldn&#39;t develop

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.679
Caption: apis for each model they were deployed i

00:08:55.599 --> 00:08:58.719
Caption: couldn&#39;t manually deploy or destroy them

00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:00.880
Caption: that sort of thing i had to make it

00:08:58.719 --> 00:09:03.679
Caption: completely automated so any future model

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.080
Caption: that&#39;s deployed i submit my criteria was

00:09:03.679 --> 00:09:08.159
Caption: automatically deployed

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.320
Caption: so i invented yet another tool this one

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:12.559
Caption: i decided to call scarborough fare as a

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.160
Caption: marketplace now as any marketplace it

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:15.679
Caption: has market rules

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:17.440
Caption: i decided that

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:19.200
Caption: one of the minimum criteria was a

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.838
Caption: confidence score now every machine

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.679
Caption: learning prediction has a confidence how

00:09:21.838 --> 00:09:25.359
Caption: confident is the model that the

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:27.440
Caption: prediction is accurate

00:09:25.359 --> 00:09:29.599
Caption: i started off with a sixty percent

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.760
Caption: accuracy rate so if the model was sixty

00:09:29.599 --> 00:09:33.119
Caption: percent sure the the

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.200
Caption: the prediction was going to be

00:09:33.119 --> 00:09:37.278
Caption: successful or positive

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:41.119
Caption: then i would score the precision that

00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:41.119
Caption: way and deploy that model to production

00:09:41.599 --> 00:09:45.759
Caption: and that&#39;s the bid i named market maker

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.359
Caption: so that&#39;s the continuous delivery so

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.838
Caption: those models if they met my criteria

00:09:47.359 --> 00:09:51.760
Caption: were deployed to

00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:54.398
Caption: production the next place i&#39;ve named cd

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.880
Caption: plus is in the devops sort of paradigm

00:09:54.398 --> 00:09:58.479
Caption: so cd plus is the continuous deployment

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.160
Caption: continuous deployment meant the model

00:09:58.479 --> 00:10:02.159
Caption: was immediately exposed to production

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:03.199
Caption: data in real time without me lifting a

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:06.398
Caption: finger

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.160
Caption: so the idea of building a api that could

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:10.159
Caption: know the features the model needed in

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:12.958
Caption: advance and simply provide them to the

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:14.479
Caption: model and in return the model gave back

00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.239
Caption: a prediction hence the idea of a

00:10:14.479 --> 00:10:17.518
Caption: marketplace where one thing is traded

00:10:16.239 --> 00:10:19.119
Caption: for another

00:10:17.518 --> 00:10:20.799
Caption: the next component was what i&#39;ve called

00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:22.239
Caption: the market taker

00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:24.078
Caption: now deploy models to productions

00:10:22.239 --> 00:10:25.518
Caption: thousands of them obviously that becomes

00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:27.518
Caption: a scalability problem after time what

00:10:25.518 --> 00:10:30.159
Caption: you want to be able to test those models

00:10:27.518 --> 00:10:31.919
Caption: and say it does not meet my standards of

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:33.679
Caption: of quality or the amount of predictions

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:35.838
Caption: i&#39;m getting i want to remove it from

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:37.599
Caption: production and make way for the next

00:10:35.838 --> 00:10:39.679
Caption: candidate

00:10:37.599 --> 00:10:40.958
Caption: to accelerate that process i created a

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:44.398
Caption: backtester

00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:46.799
Caption: or the ci part of ci cd

00:10:44.398 --> 00:10:50.159
Caption: the idea being that every data set i use

00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:52.719
Caption: to make my models is 120 days uh sorry

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:55.278
Caption: the end of the data model is 128 day 120

00:10:52.719 --> 00:10:57.199
Caption: days before today the idea being that

00:10:55.278 --> 00:11:00.320
Caption: when the model is deployed to production

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.239
Caption: every night i can run the last 120 days

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.160
Caption: of data through all the models that are

00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:06.398
Caption: in production what that allows me to do

00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:08.000
Caption: is accelerate the failure rate to one

00:11:06.398 --> 00:11:09.518
Caption: night or 24 hours

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.200
Caption: i can run four months of data and i&#39;ll

00:11:09.518 --> 00:11:12.719
Caption: know within 24 hours what it would have

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.320
Caption: done in four months

00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:17.439
Caption: and i can dispose the model far quicker

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.440
Caption: than waiting the four months

00:11:17.838 --> 00:11:21.278
Caption: so the problem with this automation is

00:11:19.599 --> 00:11:22.239
Caption: it&#39;s literally coming going like an ex

00:11:21.278 --> 00:11:24.000
Caption: like a

00:11:22.239 --> 00:11:25.278
Caption: transit station and i don&#39;t know what&#39;s

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.799
Caption: going on so what i decided to do was

00:11:25.278 --> 00:11:28.479
Caption: build a twitter account

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:29.838
Caption: and through the what scarborough affair

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:31.599
Caption: does is as it deploys models to

00:11:29.838 --> 00:11:33.599
Caption: production and disposes of them it

00:11:31.599 --> 00:11:35.919
Caption: tweets to a locked account and also when

00:11:33.599 --> 00:11:37.119
Caption: it predicts so i can see what&#39;s going on

00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:38.799
Caption: and occasionally i&#39;ll scroll through

00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:42.278
Caption: that so just to demonstrate what i&#39;ve

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:42.278
Caption: done so far

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:47.919
Caption: model dispose so that&#39;s the model being

00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:50.638
Caption: disposed in production you can see there

00:11:47.919 --> 00:11:53.039
Caption: no predictions over the last 120 days

00:11:50.638 --> 00:11:54.239
Caption: and so it has been disposed of

00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:55.919
Caption: there&#39;s another example and this is

00:11:54.239 --> 00:11:58.159
Caption: where it&#39;s less than 60 accurate over

00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:59.440
Caption: the last 120 days

00:11:58.159 --> 00:12:01.119
Caption: and again this would have been disposed

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.119
Caption: of after it was tested

00:12:01.119 --> 00:12:04.799
Caption: conversely a model deploy now model

00:12:03.119 --> 00:12:06.559
Caption: deploys when scarborough affair is

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:07.919
Caption: determined one of the models being

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.760
Caption: has been

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:10.880
Caption: invented developed is worthy of

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.320
Caption: deployment you can see there the

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.160
Caption: precision score is high it&#39;s in fact

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.600
Caption: perfect it&#39;s set to a one

00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:17.599
Caption: and that&#39;s been deployed so i&#39;ve quickly

00:12:15.599 --> 00:12:18.958
Caption: got some stats there that i want when

00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:20.559
Caption: it&#39;s tweeted out

00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.559
Caption: and then the whole reason we&#39;re doing

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:24.398
Caption: this is a prediction so there&#39;s a sample

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:26.159
Caption: prediction there so you can see it&#39;s put

00:12:24.398 --> 00:12:28.799
Caption: in the model number the confidence score

00:12:26.159 --> 00:12:30.879
Caption: in this particular case is set to 0.7

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:32.638
Caption: in recent months i&#39;ve set my confidence

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.919
Caption: score to 0.8 and i won&#39;t accept anything

00:12:32.638 --> 00:12:35.759
Caption: less than that

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:37.039
Caption: so this is an older one

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.078
Caption: you can see there though it&#39;s given the

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:39.359
Caption: announcement the time of the

00:12:38.078 --> 00:12:41.199
Caption: announcement and the website it relates

00:12:39.359 --> 00:12:43.039
Caption: to the idea being that i can follow the

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.320
Caption: trade and see if it actually plays out

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:48.559
Caption: the way the computer&#39;s predicted

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.078
Caption: the next thing i built myself was a a

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:51.679
Caption: trading desk a screen of sorts that

00:12:50.078 --> 00:12:53.679
Caption: shows me all the models as you can see

00:12:51.679 --> 00:12:55.440
Caption: there so the top list is some of the

00:12:53.679 --> 00:12:57.278
Caption: models in production that i&#39;ve got

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.720
Caption: deployed the first column there is the

00:12:57.278 --> 00:13:00.159
Caption: true positive that we discussed before

00:12:58.719 --> 00:13:01.919
Caption: so there where the computer has said

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:03.759
Caption: there will be successful trade and in

00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:06.000
Caption: fact there was false positive you can

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.760
Caption: see are all zeros but again with the

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.159
Caption: computer would have said yes trade and

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.040
Caption: we would have lost money potentially

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:13.919
Caption: and then uh false negative and true

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:15.518
Caption: negative

00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:17.200
Caption: so true negative is when there was no

00:13:15.518 --> 00:13:18.479
Caption: trading opportunity and a false negative

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.000
Caption: is a missed opportunity now i don&#39;t

00:13:18.479 --> 00:13:21.518
Caption: particularly focus on that column very

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.638
Caption: overspilled milk we look at the

00:13:21.518 --> 00:13:24.078
Caption: opportunities where we would have put

00:13:22.638 --> 00:13:25.518
Caption: money on the table but the false

00:13:24.078 --> 00:13:26.799
Caption: negative is good to see

00:13:25.518 --> 00:13:28.078
Caption: how many opportunities we miss out on

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:30.159
Caption: you can see the last two columns there

00:13:28.078 --> 00:13:31.760
Caption: percentage is those two facts

00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:34.078
Caption: below that in the table below you can

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.720
Caption: see i&#39;ve selected the last

00:13:34.078 --> 00:13:38.159
Caption: last model and there&#39;s two

00:13:36.719 --> 00:13:40.078
Caption: two predictions it&#39;s made i&#39;ve

00:13:38.159 --> 00:13:41.838
Caption: deliberately uh whited out the asx code

00:13:40.078 --> 00:13:43.919
Caption: so no one gets any ideas

00:13:41.838 --> 00:13:45.518
Caption: you can see from that the details the

00:13:43.919 --> 00:13:47.198
Caption: time the title

00:13:45.518 --> 00:13:48.719
Caption: the probability

00:13:47.198 --> 00:13:50.638
Caption: or the confidence level of the model the

00:13:48.719 --> 00:13:52.078
Caption: opening and closing price and what it

00:13:50.638 --> 00:13:55.518
Caption: played out to be so you can see in those

00:13:52.078 --> 00:13:57.359
Caption: cases it&#39;s 16 and 17 respectively so in

00:13:55.518 --> 00:14:00.398
Caption: this case it was a successful trade if

00:13:57.359 --> 00:14:01.359
Caption: we in fact had executed them

00:14:00.398 --> 00:14:03.599
Caption: so

00:14:01.359 --> 00:14:05.359
Caption: i&#39;ve been tracking that now for a um a

00:14:03.599 --> 00:14:07.359
Caption: couple of months but before

00:14:05.359 --> 00:14:08.398
Caption: that all happened

00:14:07.359 --> 00:14:10.880
Caption: um

00:14:08.398 --> 00:14:12.638
Caption: there was a period of time where

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.559
Caption: i built this and deployed this and not a

00:14:12.638 --> 00:14:15.599
Caption: single model was produced not one had

00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:17.039
Caption: met

00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:20.239
Caption: met my criteria and i think this period

00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:20.239
Caption: of time was about two months

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.440
Caption: and i was nervous was i wrong was i

00:14:22.398 --> 00:14:24.880
Caption: completely wrong were the maths wrong

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.239
Caption: was my theory wrong

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.278
Caption: and so there was there was a long period

00:14:26.239 --> 00:14:29.198
Caption: of time where i really questioned

00:14:27.278 --> 00:14:30.799
Caption: whether i&#39;d gone off on a weird tangent

00:14:29.198 --> 00:14:32.000
Caption: and i was wrong and then what i found

00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:33.518
Caption: was

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.119
Caption: after about two months models started to

00:14:33.518 --> 00:14:36.638
Caption: be deployed so through all these data

00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:38.078
Caption: sets i tested all these different

00:14:36.638 --> 00:14:39.198
Caption: features moving average economic

00:14:38.078 --> 00:14:41.760
Caption: indicators

00:14:39.198 --> 00:14:43.440
Caption: and models started to meet that that

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.639
Caption: criterion be deployed

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.760
Caption: and i went through and looked at the top

00:14:44.638 --> 00:14:48.479
Caption: one and the top one actually had a

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.119
Caption: fantastic accuracy rate had 70 percent

00:14:48.479 --> 00:14:53.198
Caption: success sorry 70 right and seven wrong

00:14:51.119 --> 00:14:54.638
Caption: seven wrong opportunities fantastic

00:14:53.198 --> 00:14:56.319
Caption: school never seen it before i thought it

00:14:54.638 --> 00:14:57.278
Caption: was worth investigating what had it

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.278
Caption: picked

00:14:57.278 --> 00:15:00.958
Caption: and what i discovered was it had picked

00:14:59.278 --> 00:15:02.958
Caption: a particular concept as what we call a

00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958
Caption: speeding ticket in the trading world and

00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.479
Caption: a speeding ticket is when a company

00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:08.398
Caption: moves

00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:10.638
Caption: outside its normal price and volume

00:15:08.398 --> 00:15:12.078
Caption: parameters so when that happens the asx

00:15:10.638 --> 00:15:13.278
Caption: notices that anomaly and will write a

00:15:12.078 --> 00:15:14.320
Caption: letter to the to the board of the

00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:15.440
Caption: company

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.119
Caption: in case there&#39;s been a leak of

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.880
Caption: information or something like that and

00:15:17.119 --> 00:15:20.638
Caption: say do you have an explanation for this

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.720
Caption: movement um

00:15:20.638 --> 00:15:24.078
Caption: price movement or volume movement and as

00:15:22.719 --> 00:15:25.919
Caption: you can see there i put up a sample of a

00:15:24.078 --> 00:15:27.518
Caption: letter there that was given to a company

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:29.679
Caption: a couple of months ago and you can see

00:15:27.518 --> 00:15:31.278
Caption: from the title the top line highlighted

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:32.638
Caption: price and volume query it&#39;s a very

00:15:31.278 --> 00:15:35.758
Caption: common document

00:15:32.638 --> 00:15:37.119
Caption: plenty come out days weeks all the time

00:15:35.758 --> 00:15:39.119
Caption: and what the machine learning model had

00:15:37.119 --> 00:15:42.000
Caption: discovered was when this this title of

00:15:39.119 --> 00:15:43.440
Caption: this document comes out the price moves

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.958
Caption: now unfortunately this document comes

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.398
Caption: out after the price moves so it&#39;s not a

00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:48.320
Caption: tradable opportunity but what it

00:15:46.398 --> 00:15:50.159
Caption: demonstrated to me was

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.679
Caption: that it learned something it learned

00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:53.679
Caption: that when this document is published by

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:55.838
Caption: a company the price will move

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:58.078
Caption: so to me i while i haven&#39;t achieved my

00:15:55.838 --> 00:15:59.440
Caption: ultimate objective of

00:15:58.078 --> 00:16:01.039
Caption: being able to trade successfully on the

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.880
Caption: asx it has demonstrated to me that i&#39;m

00:16:01.039 --> 00:16:04.479
Caption: on the right path

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.599
Caption: um

00:16:04.479 --> 00:16:07.440
Caption: so far

00:16:05.599 --> 00:16:08.799
Caption: so thanks very much for your time

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:12.159
Caption: and i&#39;ve just got some resources there

00:16:08.799 --> 00:16:14.958
Caption: around some calculations mlops as well

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:14.958
Caption: thanks for your time
