  "description": "By Macklin Hartley - Monitoring web performance used to be easy - all you had to do was track how long it took for the page to load. However, the extensive use of client-side JavaScript has introduced a raft of new ways modern websites can suffer from poor performance.\\n\\nNew performance problems require new metrics.\\nWith this in mind, Google promotes a set of new metrics known as Core Web Vitals. Core Web Vitals go well beyond directly tracking page load times, instead relying on a set of user-centric metrics that focus on loading, interactivity and visual stability.\\n\\nIn this talk, learn how to capture Core Web Vitals metrics from end users in real time and perform continuous monitoring to quickly react to performance regression as they happen.\\n\\nMostly intermediate\\n45 mins\\nFrontend Development\\nI am a Software Developer with over 7 years of experience building highly-scalable distributed systems.
