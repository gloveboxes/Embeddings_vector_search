00:00:00.658 --> 00:00:04.860
Caption: um our next speaker is Megan pusey she&#39;s

00:00:03.178 --> 00:00:07.318
Caption: here to talk about what video games have

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.200
Caption: taught me about designing for motivation

00:00:07.318 --> 00:00:11.699
Caption: Megan is a PhD candidate at Murdoch

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.798
Caption: University researching video games

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.960
Caption: motivation and resilience

00:00:13.798 --> 00:00:17.760
Caption: and she&#39;s here to tell us about what

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.680
Caption: video games have taught her about

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.549
Caption: designing for motivation so please give

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.438
Caption: her a hand

00:00:21.549 --> 00:00:28.919
Caption: [Applause]

00:00:25.438 --> 00:00:31.139
Caption: thank you all for coming obviously a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.860
Caption: quick thank you to our sponsors without

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:36.779
Caption: which DDD couldn&#39;t happen I&#39;m also

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.500
Caption: working at IBM so I have to do the

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:43.680
Caption: obligatory this is my personal views not

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.419
Caption: that representing where I work because I

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.659
Caption: have now just finished up at Murdoch

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:51.238
Caption: which is exciting so for those of you

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.639
Caption: who don&#39;t know me my name is Megan I

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:56.639
Caption: just finished a PhD in games user

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:59.159
Caption: research now doing user research at IBM

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:01.619
Caption: for enterprise software

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.080
Caption: uh previously worked as a physics

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:05.938
Caption: teacher and a science Communicator for

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.939
Caption: places like scitec

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.860
Caption: and so I have a bit of a varied

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.960
Caption: background

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.860
Caption: hence my that is why my Twitter handle

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:15.860
Caption: is the way it is

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:22.679
Caption: I wanted to start the talk with a little

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.000
Caption: thought experiment if I had a very

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.239
Caption: thickly

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.639
Caption: slathered piece of Vegemite toast not my

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:32.580
Caption: ideal ratio of Vegemite to bread or

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:34.319
Caption: toast uh hands up just a show of hands

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.720
Caption: how many people would be quite happy to

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:40.019
Caption: come and eat this lovely piece of

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.779
Caption: Vegemite toast ah quite a few keep your

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:45.419
Caption: hands up what about if I now offered you

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:47.279
Caption: five dollars to come and eat this piece

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:49.680
Caption: of Vegemite toast anyone willing for

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:52.158
Caption: five dollars what about

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.559
Caption: fifty dollars

00:01:52.158 --> 00:01:57.118
Caption: okay a few more 200 there&#39;s a few people

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:59.398
Caption: still with their hands down but I&#39;m sure

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.799
Caption: you have a price in mind to you know

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.360
Caption: withstand the very polarizing Taste of

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.200
Caption: Vegemite

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.759
Caption: um

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:07.258
Caption: I wanted to use this as an example

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.000
Caption: because it&#39;s a really good love hate

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.220
Caption: relationship

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.399
Caption: and some people are more than happy to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.339
Caption: eat Vegemite for fun others need a bit

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:21.539
Caption: of a different type of motivation

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:25.679
Caption: so things we do for fun we have internal

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:27.719
Caption: or intrinsic motivation things that we

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:29.878
Caption: might not do for fun maybe we need a bit

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.360
Caption: of reward like money

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:35.059
Caption: uh that we call external or extrinsic

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.220
Caption: motivation and we&#39;ll come back to those

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:39.779
Caption: shortly so

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.018
Caption: video games

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:46.679
Caption: as a product or an industry is made for

00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:49.440
Caption: leisure and as a hobby so they have to

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:53.159
Caption: be designed around intrinsic motivation

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.878
Caption: and for fun so good ux or a good player

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.040
Caption: experience is really core to the game as

00:02:56.878 --> 00:03:00.238
Caption: a product and doing well

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.279
Caption: however

00:03:00.238 --> 00:03:05.059
Caption: coming into

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:08.458
Caption: enterprise software or websites or apps

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:11.158
Caption: sometimes good ux is a

00:03:08.458 --> 00:03:15.238
Caption: nice to have that&#39;s added on at the end

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:16.919
Caption: and not the primary core of the

00:03:15.238 --> 00:03:19.319
Caption: experience

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.479
Caption: but also to be fair we use them

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.158
Caption: differently they&#39;re more like a tool we

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:26.339
Caption: use to get a job done they&#39;re not

00:03:23.158 --> 00:03:28.199
Caption: necessarily there for leisure

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.878
Caption: so

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.940
Caption: comparing the two

00:03:29.878 --> 00:03:35.039
Caption: one being mostly intrinsic motivation

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.040
Caption: and one being we see extrinsic

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:40.139
Caption: motivation how could we learn some

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:42.958
Caption: lessons from the world of video games

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:46.018
Caption: and apply them to Enterprise software or

00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:48.119
Caption: websites or apps and I&#39;ll just pause

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:50.518
Caption: here to say I&#39;m not going to be talking

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:52.798
Caption: about gamification in turning these

00:03:50.518 --> 00:03:55.619
Caption: tools into games but more about how

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:57.839
Caption: could we tweak them

00:03:55.619 --> 00:04:00.119
Caption: um to be more intrinsically motivating

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:01.440
Caption: so one of the series that I&#39;ve done a

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:04.018
Caption: lot of work in and I won&#39;t bore you with

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.238
Caption: it but basically the theory says that

00:04:04.018 --> 00:04:09.059
Caption: intrinsic motivation is made of three

00:04:06.238 --> 00:04:11.220
Caption: elements so there&#39;s autonomy which is a

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:13.619
Caption: fancy way of seeing you have choice and

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.320
Caption: control over things

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:18.839
Caption: competence which means you feel skilled

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.000
Caption: at doing a particular activity or your

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:22.018
Caption: skill is improving you don&#39;t have to be

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.339
Caption: a master

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.380
Caption: at the activity and relatedness which is

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:30.419
Caption: filling a connection to other people or

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.639
Caption: a community of people so these three

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.220
Caption: things combining together help make

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.919
Caption: stuff really intrinsically motivating

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.619
Caption: and fun to do

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.720
Caption: uh you know being a now being working in

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:45.899
Caption: design love a good how might we

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.479
Caption: statement so having worked at IBM for a

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:50.880
Caption: bit now I thought well how might we as a

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.459
Caption: fun challenge design enterprise software

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.580
Caption: to be more intrinsically motivating to

00:04:53.459 --> 00:05:00.600
Caption: use again without turning it into a game

00:04:56.579 --> 00:05:03.119
Caption: because it is meant to be a tool

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.520
Caption: starting with our first element of

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:09.779
Caption: autonomy gains usually do this really

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:12.000
Caption: well one good example of this is from

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:14.940
Caption: competitive first person shooter games

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.059
Caption: usually this is a screenshot from a

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.059
Caption: fortnight menu where the game is

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:22.979
Caption: allowing you to completely remap your

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:25.259
Caption: controller you have complete control

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.820
Caption: over which button does what

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.759
Caption: so you can

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.320
Caption: make it to your liking not all games do

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:35.580
Caption: this but the competitive games usually

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.460
Caption: have do this a bit better than others

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:40.138
Caption: uh and a good example from other

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:41.459
Caption: software that give you good choice and

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.339
Caption: control

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:47.339
Caption: is the Adobe suite you can completely

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:50.160
Caption: move the menus around change which icons

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:51.959
Caption: are in your menu I&#39;m left-handed so if I

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.360
Caption: was to do any drawing on a touch screen

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:57.419
Caption: I&#39;d move all the menus to the right hand

00:05:54.359 --> 00:06:00.478
Caption: side and it enables me to do that

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.699
Caption: not all software does so that&#39;s one good

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:06.479
Caption: example of referring choice and control

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:09.479
Caption: in a non-game scenario

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.380
Caption: another great one is slack and a lot of

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.500
Caption: other

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.759
Caption: software has a light and a dark mode

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.320
Caption: slack goes a little bit further with the

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.940
Caption: different color modes

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.259
Caption: and if you actually scroll all the way

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.479
Caption: to the bottom

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.580
Caption: Dawn mentioned this in her accessibility

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:26.940
Caption: talk this morning as well

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:29.220
Caption: but there are actually a few color

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.259
Caption: schemes specifically designed for people

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.380
Caption: with different types of color blindness

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:36.299
Caption: and offering choice and control over

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.539
Caption: things that might seem like a really

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:41.638
Caption: small deal to you can have a really

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:43.440
Caption: great added benefit of improving

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.720
Caption: accessibility for some of your other

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.160
Caption: users that you might not even recognize

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:53.100
Caption: when you first add this feature in

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.039
Caption: moving on to our second strand which is

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.779
Caption: competence uh lots of video games

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.279
Caption: do this really well as well because they

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:01.739
Caption: essentially have to teach you how to use

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:02.579
Caption: the game while you&#39;re in the game

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:04.319
Caption: um

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:06.319
Caption: one of my favorite games that I&#39;ve done

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:09.299
Caption: used in my research which was really fun

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:11.639
Caption: is called Untitled Goose game the

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:13.978
Caption: premise is that you or I are a

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:17.160
Caption: mysterious Goose running around in

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:18.839
Caption: English Village causing Mayhem so in

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.720
Caption: each section of the village you get a

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:23.819
Caption: to-do list and as you complete the to-do

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.220
Caption: list it crosses off

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:27.979
Caption: that action and different tasks are more

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.419
Caption: difficult than others

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:32.098
Caption: so when you go shopping if you put the

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:34.080
Caption: toothbrush in the basket it will cross

00:07:32.098 --> 00:07:35.940
Caption: off the just the word toothbrush

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:38.339
Caption: and if the toothbrush somehow comes out

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.619
Caption: of the basket it uncrosses off as well

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:41.339
Caption: so it&#39;s like reactive

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:44.519
Caption: um

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:47.039
Caption: so games do Quest logs missions and

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:48.598
Caption: checklists like this really really

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:51.239
Caption: really well

00:07:48.598 --> 00:07:53.339
Caption: and you feel a sense of progress like

00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:54.779
Caption: you&#39;ve achieved something also really

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:56.339
Caption: handy like me if you haven&#39;t played the

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:57.598
Caption: game you forget about it and come back

00:07:56.339 --> 00:08:00.359
Caption: six months later and you can&#39;t remember

00:07:57.598 --> 00:08:02.339
Caption: what you&#39;re up to these Quest logs and

00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:05.038
Caption: checklists can help you get oh that&#39;s

00:08:02.339 --> 00:08:09.139
Caption: right I was trying to steal shopping

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:09.139
Caption: items from this poor shopkeeper

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:18.179
Caption: and

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:19.860
Caption: one online course I was doing recently

00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:21.899
Caption: through the interaction design

00:08:19.859 --> 00:08:24.179
Caption: Foundation I thought did this really

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:26.459
Caption: well uh in their website or their

00:08:24.179 --> 00:08:27.660
Caption: courses followed it sort of layout so on

00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:30.440
Caption: the left here we&#39;ve got their clear

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:34.320
Caption: progression of chapters or lessons

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.820
Caption: within each lesson we&#39;ve got sub parts

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.098
Caption: and as you complete them you get a nice

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.778
Caption: green tick and as you earn points by

00:08:38.098 --> 00:08:42.239
Caption: answering questions throughout the

00:08:39.778 --> 00:08:44.880
Caption: course the Blue Points sort of float up

00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:47.338
Caption: to the progress bar up the top there so

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.140
Caption: you can clearly see how much you&#39;ve got

00:08:47.338 --> 00:08:50.940
Caption: left to go until you get the little

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.398
Caption: course certificate so it&#39;s a nice visual

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.500
Caption: reminder of the progress you&#39;ve made so

00:08:53.398 --> 00:08:56.880
Caption: far and as you get closer and closer to

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.679
Caption: the end it becomes even more and more

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.580
Caption: motivating because you&#39;re like oh just a

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:01.580
Caption: few more points and I&#39;m finished

00:09:02.219 --> 00:09:06.898
Caption: and so yeah they&#39;re on the left

00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:08.880
Caption: um other places do this really well I

00:09:06.898 --> 00:09:10.919
Caption: liked the salonist example but you I

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.080
Caption: noticed udemy also does this really well

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:14.940
Caption: they&#39;ll have a Time indicator next to

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.040
Caption: each step or segment especially if it&#39;s

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.440
Caption: video based and that gives you a good

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:21.719
Caption: indication of how difficult or how long

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.539
Caption: the task is going to take so I know for

00:09:21.719 --> 00:09:25.859
Caption: me if I only have a half hour or so I&#39;m

00:09:24.539 --> 00:09:27.599
Caption: not going to start anything too

00:09:25.859 --> 00:09:29.820
Caption: complicated because I&#39;m not going to get

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:32.958
Caption: it finished and by offering these sort

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:35.220
Caption: of indicators of difficulty or time

00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.599
Caption: you can make a good judgment about

00:09:35.219 --> 00:09:39.859
Caption: whether you want to start that activity

00:09:36.599 --> 00:09:39.859
Caption: now or not

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:44.820
Caption: a bad example

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:47.039
Caption: as a researcher I like doing other

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.500
Caption: people&#39;s surveys to see what they&#39;ve

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:52.380
Caption: done at a professional interest I had an

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.539
Caption: Etsy survey pop up as I was browsing you

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.299
Caption: can see I was browsing Pokemon plush toy

00:09:54.539 --> 00:09:59.099
Caption: thingos

00:09:56.299 --> 00:10:02.039
Caption: so I pressed sure I&#39;ll do your annoying

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:03.838
Caption: pop-up survey and this was the first

00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:05.338
Caption: question but immediately I kind of

00:10:03.838 --> 00:10:06.838
Caption: noticed well I was in the middle of

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:08.640
Caption: doing something

00:10:06.838 --> 00:10:09.958
Caption: I&#39;m doing you a favor and you&#39;re not

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.160
Caption: telling me how long this is going to

00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:14.159
Caption: take

00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:16.739
Caption: no indication of progress and I&#39;ve used

00:10:14.159 --> 00:10:18.179
Caption: qualtrics before same with Microsoft

00:10:16.739 --> 00:10:20.039
Caption: forms and I&#39;m sure many of the other

00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:22.140
Caption: ones there is always an option there to

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:23.820
Caption: enable the progress bar

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.260
Caption: which just puts a little bar at the top

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.778
Caption: of the bottom to show you a percentage

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.419
Caption: of how far through the survey you are

00:10:27.778 --> 00:10:32.820
Caption: just a small thing like that

00:10:30.419 --> 00:10:35.639
Caption: can help motivate people to complete the

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.919
Caption: task same with retail websites and

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.299
Caption: shopping checkout baskets you&#39;ll often

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:41.880
Caption: see the steps

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:44.640
Caption: listed or how close you are to finishing

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.619
Caption: that purchase so about two or three

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.420
Caption: questions in in my head and going I want

00:10:46.619 --> 00:10:50.578
Caption: to get back to what I was doing how much

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:52.380
Caption: longer have I got left to go I want to

00:10:50.578 --> 00:10:53.099
Caption: quit this and just keep doing what I was

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.160
Caption: doing

00:10:53.099 --> 00:10:58.199
Caption: I was just curious so I kept going and

00:10:56.159 --> 00:11:00.599
Caption: it was about five quick questions but I

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.458
Caption: could see I imagine on the back end it&#39;d

00:11:00.599 --> 00:11:04.259
Caption: be quite a lot of churn or a lot of

00:11:02.458 --> 00:11:06.239
Caption: people dropping out after that second

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.619
Caption: question because there&#39;s no indication

00:11:06.239 --> 00:11:09.619
Caption: of how long this thing is going for

00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:15.239
Caption: and our third stream which is uh an

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:17.880
Caption: interesting one because we&#39;re talking

00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:19.799
Caption: about connection to other people and

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.140
Caption: building community and immediately

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:24.719
Caption: people think about that as being real

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.880
Caption: time or multiplayer in the game sense

00:11:24.719 --> 00:11:28.199
Caption: but it doesn&#39;t have to be so I will

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.320
Caption: start with a multiplayer game because

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.260
Caption: that&#39;s the obvious uh I guess

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:37.260
Caption: friendship building or breaking activity

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:40.559
Caption: in video games one of my favorite genres

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:42.419
Caption: is called couch Co-op this is one

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:44.518
Caption: example called overcooked where you&#39;re

00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:46.018
Caption: working as a team of four to finish

00:11:44.518 --> 00:11:48.719
Caption: these orders in this level they&#39;re

00:11:46.018 --> 00:11:50.700
Caption: making burgers and usually the levels

00:11:48.719 --> 00:11:52.679
Caption: are set out in such a way that only

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.140
Caption: certain people can do certain steps of

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:56.518
Caption: the process so like a team where you&#39;ve

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:59.100
Caption: got a Dev and a designer and you can

00:11:56.518 --> 00:12:01.139
Caption: only no one person can do everything so

00:11:59.099 --> 00:12:03.179
Caption: you&#39;re having to yell at one and cook

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.700
Caption: the steak what are you doing

00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:07.559
Caption: and pass me the tomatoes where&#39;s this

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.359
Caption: where&#39;s it yeah so there&#39;s a lot of

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:10.500
Caption: yelling uh but it&#39;s really fun and

00:12:09.359 --> 00:12:12.599
Caption: you&#39;re working in this game you&#39;re

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.179
Caption: working to a clock uh so you have to do

00:12:12.599 --> 00:12:17.219
Caption: as many as possible in the time limit uh

00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:18.479
Caption: to pass the level so I find them really

00:12:17.219 --> 00:12:20.338
Caption: fun other people find them really

00:12:18.479 --> 00:12:23.760
Caption: stressful

00:12:20.338 --> 00:12:26.219
Caption: um but that designing the levels in such

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.359
Caption: a way that one person cannot do the

00:12:26.219 --> 00:12:29.639
Caption: level alone

00:12:27.359 --> 00:12:33.898
Caption: helps build that

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:35.820
Caption: um teamwork and one tool I&#39;ve been using

00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:38.179
Caption: a lot of recently that I think has a lot

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:40.799
Caption: of features to make real-time

00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:42.419
Caption: collaboration online really good and

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:45.119
Caption: there&#39;s lots of tools like this one this

00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:48.179
Caption: isn&#39;t the only one is mural it&#39;s like an

00:12:45.119 --> 00:12:50.518
Caption: online whiteboard where you can put fake

00:12:48.179 --> 00:12:53.159
Caption: digital sticky notes on there

00:12:50.518 --> 00:12:55.078
Caption: some of the features I like is that when

00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:56.819
Caption: you&#39;re all on the same mural you can see

00:12:55.078 --> 00:12:58.440
Caption: everyone&#39;s pointers it has their name

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.018
Caption: next to it so you can clearly see where

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.159
Caption: everyone is and what they&#39;re doing if

00:13:01.018 --> 00:13:04.320
Caption: you&#39;re a facilitator you have

00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:06.659
Caption: facilitated superpowers you can summon

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.880
Caption: everyone to view what you&#39;re viewing on

00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:10.559
Caption: the screen

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.299
Caption: you can lock things down so other people

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:15.239
Caption: can&#39;t move and mess with your templates

00:13:12.299 --> 00:13:16.619
Caption: when you&#39;re doing brainstorming and so

00:13:15.239 --> 00:13:18.539
Caption: it has a lot of really really nice

00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:20.518
Caption: features to enable you to do that

00:13:18.539 --> 00:13:22.138
Caption: real-time stuff together really really

00:13:20.518 --> 00:13:24.898
Caption: well and

00:13:22.138 --> 00:13:26.458
Caption: again linking back to choice and control

00:13:24.898 --> 00:13:29.578
Caption: a lot of these features you can turn on

00:13:26.458 --> 00:13:31.799
Caption: and off if you made the mural yourself

00:13:29.578 --> 00:13:33.599
Caption: so often a lot of clients I&#39;m working

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:37.018
Caption: with are not have never used this tool

00:13:33.599 --> 00:13:39.179
Caption: before so we lock down a lot of things

00:13:37.018 --> 00:13:39.838
Caption: so they can&#39;t mess with it and

00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:41.700
Caption: um

00:13:39.838 --> 00:13:43.619
Caption: yeah get them to follow our screen and

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.200
Caption: guide them through the process so those

00:13:43.619 --> 00:13:48.958
Caption: features are really good for that

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.660
Caption: another example of communication in

00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:54.239
Caption: games again this is a competitive

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:56.039
Caption: first person sort of game but it&#39;s a

00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:59.039
Caption: team game so you&#39;re working on a team of

00:13:56.039 --> 00:14:00.359
Caption: five or six and a few other games also

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:02.578
Caption: do this really well but I just couldn&#39;t

00:14:00.359 --> 00:14:05.159
Caption: find a good screenshot to show it so

00:14:02.578 --> 00:14:08.278
Caption: Apex Legends probably does this the best

00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:10.199
Caption: is called a ping system where

00:14:08.278 --> 00:14:11.458
Caption: very quickly you have to communicate

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.799
Caption: information to very important

00:14:11.458 --> 00:14:15.539
Caption: information to your team so on your

00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:18.299
Caption: controller or keyboard you can press a

00:14:15.539 --> 00:14:20.278
Caption: button and there&#39;s just a standard menu

00:14:18.299 --> 00:14:22.138
Caption: of things and you can customize this

00:14:20.278 --> 00:14:23.700
Caption: menu as well but these are the most

00:14:22.138 --> 00:14:25.320
Caption: common messages you want to share with

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.359
Caption: your team and you can ping a particular

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.679
Caption: location on the map and your whole team

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:31.440
Caption: can then see that piece of information

00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:33.739
Caption: very quickly it&#39;s quicker than trying to

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.419
Caption: type or say it over voice

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:38.700
Caption: often and if you&#39;ve watched any Esports

00:14:36.419 --> 00:14:40.380
Caption: they will use a ping system quite a lot

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:43.679
Caption: and they&#39;ll be very short and sharp with

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:47.039
Caption: their verbal communication

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:49.380
Caption: um the closest I could think of

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:53.039
Caption: like this but not in games was probably

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:56.220
Caption: the whole reaction thing in social media

00:14:53.039 --> 00:15:00.119
Caption: and in in places like LinkedIn it allows

00:14:56.219 --> 00:15:02.638
Caption: you to show support or show a sense of

00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:04.440
Caption: community quickly without having to put

00:15:02.638 --> 00:15:06.539
Caption: effort into it so you&#39;re like hey yeah

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:09.539
Caption: well done yay DDD I&#39;m excited without

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:12.018
Caption: having to spend the time typing that

00:15:09.539 --> 00:15:12.018
Caption: message in

00:15:12.138 --> 00:15:17.219
Caption: uh one interesting example that I like

00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:19.458
Caption: bringing up a lot from video games is

00:15:17.219 --> 00:15:22.739
Caption: it&#39;s more asynchronous

00:15:19.458 --> 00:15:25.440
Caption: is Sky which is a great game you can get

00:15:22.739 --> 00:15:28.619
Caption: on tablets in the switch

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:31.138
Caption: um you run around it&#39;s single player and

00:15:28.619 --> 00:15:34.320
Caption: the Dark Souls games do this as well you

00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:36.719
Caption: can leave a particular item in the world

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.160
Caption: and attach a message to that item and

00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:40.278
Caption: other players can then go and discover

00:15:38.159 --> 00:15:42.539
Caption: that item and read your message

00:15:40.278 --> 00:15:45.119
Caption: sometimes in Dark Souls players will

00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:59.958
Caption: as a game it&#39;s not Dark Souls is pretty

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.760
Caption: punishing

00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:03.958
Caption: but it&#39;s this way that they build a

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.299
Caption: sense of community and connection

00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:08.880
Caption: without it being real time

00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:10.619
Caption: and it&#39;s a single player game often we

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.338
Caption: think of single player experiences as

00:16:10.619 --> 00:16:17.578
Caption: not being social whereas this is a very

00:16:14.338 --> 00:16:18.898
Caption: very social single player game

00:16:17.578 --> 00:16:21.119
Caption: I couldn&#39;t

00:16:18.898 --> 00:16:24.539
Caption: really it took me a while to think of an

00:16:21.119 --> 00:16:28.138
Caption: example from non-games but I do remember

00:16:24.539 --> 00:16:30.479
Caption: in having done some writing

00:16:28.138 --> 00:16:34.078
Caption: um for a website called particle they

00:16:30.479 --> 00:16:36.239
Caption: used a service called gather content and

00:16:34.078 --> 00:16:38.219
Caption: essentially but I mean shared documents

00:16:36.239 --> 00:16:40.500
Caption: do this as well it was really easy for

00:16:38.219 --> 00:16:42.599
Caption: people to leave comments on my article

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.278
Caption: asynchronously I could log in and then

00:16:42.599 --> 00:16:46.138
Caption: see what they had written and then go

00:16:44.278 --> 00:16:48.479
Caption: and make the relevant edits or changes

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:50.698
Caption: that were requested same with shared

00:16:48.479 --> 00:16:55.559
Caption: Google Docs or online you know Office

00:16:50.698 --> 00:16:57.419
Caption: 365 documents it&#39;s I think this one is I

00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:58.919
Caption: see it being used more and more it&#39;s a

00:16:57.419 --> 00:17:01.440
Caption: great way to asynchronously work

00:16:58.919 --> 00:17:04.859
Caption: together on something without

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.780
Caption: doing the track changes in word which I

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:08.938
Caption: find very painful

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:11.280
Caption: um so gather content is a great example

00:17:08.938 --> 00:17:14.640
Caption: of that as well as just general shared

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:17.818
Caption: collaborative documents

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.880
Caption: I did want to spend two seconds quickly

00:17:17.818 --> 00:17:22.438
Caption: talking about competitive Elements which

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.599
Caption: often come up when people start talking

00:17:22.438 --> 00:17:26.458
Caption: about gamification so back to the

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:29.160
Caption: interaction design Foundation screen

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:30.959
Caption: they do have a ranking of your score and

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.820
Caption: I think if you get the max score for the

00:17:30.959 --> 00:17:35.099
Caption: course you can have multiple people

00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:35.819
Caption: sitting at first

00:17:35.099 --> 00:17:38.400
Caption: um

00:17:35.819 --> 00:17:41.519
Caption: and it goes up as you get more points

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:44.119
Caption: and the best I&#39;ve seen competitive done

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:47.760
Caption: I guess in a

00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:50.280
Caption: gamey kind of sense is in a non-game

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.660
Caption: game is Duolingo which is for learning

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.640
Caption: languages

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.140
Caption: what I liked about Duolingo is that

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.239
Caption: competitive things can be really

00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:00.000
Caption: demotivating if you&#39;re losing and

00:17:57.239 --> 00:18:01.678
Caption: especially if you have no way to get

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.859
Caption: back to the top to get back to winning

00:18:01.678 --> 00:18:06.479
Caption: so the way that duo lingo combat this is

00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:09.000
Caption: you get a lot of points just by

00:18:06.479 --> 00:18:11.939
Caption: participating number one great just for

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.660
Caption: trying and you can see that there&#39;s a

00:18:11.939 --> 00:18:17.639
Caption: limit on the leaderboard so I don&#39;t know

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.720
Caption: what the time refresh time is maybe it&#39;s

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.520
Caption: every week

00:18:18.719 --> 00:18:22.619
Caption: every week they&#39;ll refresh and restart

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.299
Caption: the leaderboards from scratch so even if

00:18:22.619 --> 00:18:25.918
Caption: you were losing one week

00:18:24.298 --> 00:18:27.719
Caption: next week you&#39;re in with a whole nother

00:18:25.918 --> 00:18:30.418
Caption: shot so it&#39;s a lot more motivating to

00:18:27.719 --> 00:18:33.178
Caption: have that refreshing leaderboard and

00:18:30.418 --> 00:18:36.418
Caption: that ability to get back

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:38.579
Caption: to be potentially winning so I think use

00:18:36.418 --> 00:18:40.558
Caption: competitive or look at competitive

00:18:38.579 --> 00:18:42.538
Caption: elements with a real grain of salt

00:18:40.558 --> 00:18:44.219
Caption: because I think you always need to

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:47.219
Caption: consider the losers how is it going to

00:18:44.219 --> 00:18:49.380
Caption: feel to be the loser is if there&#39;s low

00:18:47.219 --> 00:18:51.119
Caption: stakes that&#39;s better if there&#39;s high

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.798
Caption: stakes it really sucks to be the loser

00:18:51.119 --> 00:18:56.219
Caption: is there any way for them to come back

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:58.500
Caption: from losing or think about those things

00:18:56.219 --> 00:19:00.178
Caption: as well not just the winners motivation

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:04.079
Caption: is really tricky when you start making

00:19:00.178 --> 00:19:06.479
Caption: it competitive versus collaborative

00:19:04.079 --> 00:19:08.640
Caption: that was all I had time for today thank
