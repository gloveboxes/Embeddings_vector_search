00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:09.940
Caption: hello Rob just asked if he wanted him to

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.968
Caption: introduce me and I said no so I&#39;m gonna

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:16.029
Caption: introduce myself I&#39;m Alice I&#39;m a

00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:18.329
Caption: software developer at ratify and today

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.740
Caption: I&#39;m going to be talking to you all about

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:23.198
Caption: this idea of creative coding and

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:26.219
Caption: particularly in relationship to the

00:00:23.198 --> 00:00:29.709
Caption: JavaScript canvas now to start off with

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:33.159
Caption: why do we care about this Who am I

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:37.299
Caption: what&#39;s going on so as I said before I&#39;m

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:39.459
Caption: I&#39;m Alice and I&#39;m a developer but in my

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:42.159
Caption: spare time I&#39;m also an artist and I do a

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:43.770
Caption: lot of creative visual work which is

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:49.799
Caption: usually in very traditional mediums like

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.058
Caption: paint not the computer paint that and

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:54.609
Caption: when I was growing up when I was a

00:00:52.058 --> 00:00:56.828
Caption: teenager this was a bit problematic when

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.659
Caption: it came to school because I found that

00:00:56.828 --> 00:01:00.488
Caption: in the syllabus it was really hard to do

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.229
Caption: an art class and a computer class at the

00:01:00.488 --> 00:01:03.909
Caption: same time the syllabus was just not set

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.050
Caption: up for you to do those two courses it&#39;s

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.089
Caption: because they&#39;re like well you know

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.160
Caption: computer programming it&#39;s really it&#39;s in

00:01:07.089 --> 00:01:11.439
Caption: the scientific half of the syllabus and

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.150
Caption: then there&#39;s art and that&#39;s a creative

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.090
Caption: you know the left brain side of things

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.919
Caption: and so the idea of someone wanting to do

00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:19.689
Caption: both of those things at the same time in

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:21.790
Caption: our education system was viewed as it&#39;s

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.170
Caption: like a bit weird sorry I think my hairs

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:29.199
Caption: touching that a bit so I&#39;m really keen

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:30.909
Caption: through my work and through other

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:32.500
Caption: avenues to really promote this idea that

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.090
Caption: those really aren&#39;t two different things

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.830
Caption: they actually can see it quite closely

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:40.389
Caption: together now I should clarify that I

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.930
Caption: think there are a lot of really useful

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:44.919
Caption: talks here today that I know I&#39;ve picked

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.379
Caption: up some things and I&#39;m like I&#39;m gonna

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:48.790
Caption: take this back to my work next week and

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:50.619
Caption: start incorporating it it&#39;s gonna be

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.150
Caption: really useful and that kind of thing

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.190
Caption: that&#39;s this is not particularly useful

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.090
Caption: it&#39;s just kind of cool

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.220
Caption: I find it entertaining I don&#39;t know so

00:01:58.089 --> 00:02:03.489
Caption: this is just going to be a basic

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.380
Caption: introduction to the JavaScript canvas

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:07.869
Caption: and some ways you can make some really

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:09.520
Caption: simple art visualizations using it these

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.930
Caption: aren&#39;t gonna be very advanced these are

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.389
Caption: just the basic tools that you might like

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.739
Caption: to use and then you can really take that

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:19.029
Caption: in any direct

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.940
Caption: so this is an example of a very very

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:24.729
Caption: simple canvas element with a very simple

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.760
Caption: illustration on it it&#39;s a cube it&#39;s not

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:30.519
Caption: very interesting all I&#39;ve done here is

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:33.669
Caption: locate the canvas and draw a rectangle

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.740
Caption: on it so pretty much all we can do with

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.059
Caption: the canvas is we can draw squares on it

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.889
Caption: we can draw circles on it we can draw

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:41.919
Caption: lines and we can make those things

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:44.229
Caption: different colors I think one of the

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:48.009
Caption: reasons I enjoy this medium so much is

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:49.899
Caption: because there&#39;s not really a complicated

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:52.209
Caption: framework to interact with it you can

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:53.289
Caption: draw points on a screen and you can put

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.060
Caption: those points where you want to put them

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.529
Caption: there&#39;s not really anything more to it

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.209
Caption: than that

00:02:55.529 --> 00:03:00.279
Caption: so I think probably the first

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.130
Caption: interesting thing you do with this kind

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:06.220
Caption: of frame is to introduce animation to it

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.779
Caption: so there are probably two components to

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.380
Caption: this that I should explain firstly we&#39;re

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:13.690
Caption: using time here to position something on

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.770
Caption: the screen and secondly we&#39;re requesting

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.910
Caption: a frame from your browser and saying hey

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.860
Caption: you know give me a frame you notice that

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.290
Caption: I could write this function within a

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.259
Caption: loop and say 60 times a second can you

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:28.000
Caption: please supply a frame but I think it&#39;s

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.409
Caption: better to request the foam and then the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Caption: browser can actually you know if you&#39;re

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.760
Caption: like hey chrome give me some frames and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.458
Caption: Chrome&#39;s like no I have 500 tabs open I

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:39.159
Caption: don&#39;t have any power to do that it&#39;s

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:40.988
Caption: fine like so you&#39;ll notice if you if you

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.180
Caption: put that in a loop that runs at a set

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:44.559
Caption: period of time you can kind of have some

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:47.619
Caption: really bad performance issues with your

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:49.089
Caption: browser which is probably not super

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:50.409
Caption: respectful of your users who might be

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:52.000
Caption: viewing your animation it might be a bit

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.130
Caption: problematic for them the other problem

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.039
Caption: with this initial animation is um so I

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.820
Caption: animated a cube and I haven&#39;t really I

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:59.768
Caption: don&#39;t know where it&#39;s gone it&#39;s like

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.739
Caption: over there cuz that&#39;s not bounded by

00:03:59.768 --> 00:04:05.738
Caption: anything so it&#39;s pretty easy to add some

00:04:02.738 --> 00:04:09.369
Caption: simple constraints so that that would

00:04:05.738 --> 00:04:10.569
Caption: keep within the confines of the canvas

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:13.330
Caption: that you&#39;re drawing on so here it&#39;s just

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.149
Caption: modded by the width of the canvas which

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.760
Caption: produces a pretty boring animation of a

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:20.199
Caption: cube rotating I mean speeding through

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.960
Caption: space it&#39;s not particularly interesting

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.850
Caption: but through chucking and some other

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:26.919
Caption: elements so here I&#39;ve just introduced a

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.240
Caption: simple sine wave to figure out where it

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.740
Caption: sits on the y-axis

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:32.829
Caption: we can make that movement feel a lot

00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:33.970
Caption: more natural and a bit more engaging to

00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:36.579
Caption: the eye what I think is interesting

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.619
Caption: about working with these kinds of

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:41.109
Caption: formulas is that you can kind of create

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:42.789
Caption: a something of them I would say a

00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:45.549
Caption: personality maybe that&#39;s just me but

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:48.130
Caption: there&#39;s something about the way that&#39;s

00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:50.019
Caption: certain like particularly like I find

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.669
Caption: sine and cosine waves move it&#39;s very

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:54.819
Caption: pleasing to the eye on it and it&#39;s very

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:57.250
Caption: engaging in a way that just a linear

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:58.809
Caption: movement back and forward is not now at

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.759
Caption: the side of my talk I promise that this

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:04.139
Caption: would not be interesting or financially

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:06.339
Caption: useful in any way I do think that

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.399
Caption: learning how to illustrate things in a

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:11.679
Caption: way that&#39;s engaging to a user or someone

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:13.598
Caption: watching it can actually be quite useful

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:15.940
Caption: when you are designing websites and

00:05:13.598 --> 00:05:18.279
Caption: other applications I have a friend that

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.809
Caption: kind of refused to stop using facebook

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:22.479
Caption: Messenger because he really likes the

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:23.829
Caption: way when you click on the little like

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.509
Caption: you tap the little emoji in the bottom

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:27.098
Caption: right corner it expands and then it pops

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.779
Caption: and he&#39;s like yeah I just I just really

00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:30.609
Caption: like doing that I don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:31.959
Caption: want to leave so a simple little

00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:34.179
Caption: animation like that can actually

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:35.769
Caption: generate value I don&#39;t know if this is

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:39.549
Caption: gonna generate any value for anyone it&#39;s

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:41.709
Caption: pretty not very interesting

00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:43.809
Caption: so one thing I&#39;ve been doing with these

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:47.408
Caption: simple illustrations is clearing the

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:49.059
Caption: canvas away every frame now that&#39;s not a

00:05:47.408 --> 00:05:50.380
Caption: default behavior of the canvas and if

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:53.589
Caption: you don&#39;t do that you can start to

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.059
Caption: notice some weird things some weird

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:57.639
Caption: patterns emerging pretty quickly but

00:05:55.059 --> 00:06:01.658
Caption: because I&#39;m not styling this element in

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:03.009
Caption: any way it is not super engaging either

00:06:01.658 --> 00:06:04.929
Caption: especially because pretty soon we&#39;re not

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:09.399
Caption: gonna be able to see anything cuz that&#39;s

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:14.049
Caption: gonna cover a whole canvas so luckily we

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:16.989
Caption: can use a fill style to programmatically

00:06:14.049 --> 00:06:18.908
Caption: decide on our color in the same way that

00:06:16.989 --> 00:06:22.718
Caption: we are programmatically deciding where

00:06:18.908 --> 00:06:24.699
Caption: our element sits on the screen here you

00:06:22.718 --> 00:06:27.098
Caption: can see you know when I mentioned before

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:30.339
Caption: that we&#39;re requesting the frame from the

00:06:27.098 --> 00:06:31.989
Caption: browser so if that frame was being

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:33.279
Caption: supplied 60 times a million second we&#39;d

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:35.319
Caption: see a much smoother line but those

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:37.059
Caption: little jitters are just due to my

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:42.920
Caption: browser probably having too many tabs

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:45.829
Caption: open now this is just a

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.600
Caption: element being drawn per frame in my mind

00:06:45.829 --> 00:06:51.259
Caption: one of the really cool things about the

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.240
Caption: canvas element is that because it&#39;s so

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.040
Caption: cheap to draw rectangles particularly

00:06:53.239 --> 00:06:56.239
Caption: rectangles you can draw other shapes as

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.600
Caption: well but a rectangle is quite a cheap

00:06:56.239 --> 00:07:01.579
Caption: shape to draw you can actually draw up

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.260
Caption: to probably I would say about 60,000

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:04.970
Caption: different objects per second here I&#39;m

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.240
Caption: not drawing that many it&#39;s only what

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:12.079
Caption: does that would be about 600 a second

00:07:08.239 --> 00:07:14.389
Caption: and you can use that to create for lack

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:17.839
Caption: of a better word psychedelic vomit I

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.400
Caption: don&#39;t know like I say this isn&#39;t really

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:21.350
Caption: for anything it&#39;s just mucking around

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:24.380
Caption: with JavaScript and mucking around with

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:26.149
Caption: the canvas but to be honest I think the

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.440
Caption: idea of mucking around with coding is

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:32.059
Caption: quite valuable and often when I am

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.739
Caption: teaching programming to people for the

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:35.690
Caption: first time which I sometimes go out to

00:07:33.739 --> 00:07:37.009
Caption: schools and I sometimes teach people who

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.080
Caption: otherwise wouldn&#39;t be interested in

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.270
Caption: programming about some basics I find

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:43.819
Caption: when you can introduce visual elements

00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:46.029
Caption: and the concept of play into programming

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:50.809
Caption: it becomes a much more interesting

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:52.489
Caption: intriguing thing to learn so I promised

00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:54.380
Caption: it wouldn&#39;t be at all useful but there

00:07:52.489 --> 00:07:57.529
Caption: are two use cases that are outlined here

00:07:54.380 --> 00:08:01.489
Caption: that might be good so the for the second

00:07:57.529 --> 00:08:06.010
Caption: part of my talk I just wanted to show an

00:08:01.489 --> 00:08:09.679
Caption: application that I have used this for

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:11.480
Caption: and I would like everyone to just cross

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:14.239
Caption: your fingers and toes for the live demo

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.220
Caption: gods because this may not work I have a

00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:18.489
Caption: video if it doesn&#39;t but we&#39;ll see how we

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.489
Caption: go

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.809
Caption: I&#39;m a little guy do did you do

00:08:47.729 --> 00:08:51.039
Caption: luckily because I have no faith in the

00:08:50.109 --> 00:08:53.169
Caption: live demo gods

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:55.389
Caption: I prepared a beautiful video of my

00:08:53.169 --> 00:08:57.099
Caption: demonstration working and so if you

00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:02.278
Caption: would also set then disbelief and

00:08:57.099 --> 00:09:07.088
Caption: pretend that this is completely live so

00:09:02.278 --> 00:09:08.830
Caption: this visualization here in a slightly

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:11.229
Caption: alternative universe where this just

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.610
Caption: connected perfectly to my projector is

00:09:11.229 --> 00:09:15.519
Caption: actually taking a reading from this

00:09:12.609 --> 00:09:17.489
Caption: headset which is a pretty boring reading

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:23.170
Caption: maybe it&#39;s actually come up since then

00:09:17.489 --> 00:09:25.750
Caption: of no it hasn&#39;t but it&#39;s taken a pretty

00:09:23.169 --> 00:09:29.528
Caption: uninteresting reading it&#39;s about eight

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:31.119
Caption: different levels of EEG data which often

00:09:29.528 --> 00:09:33.778
Caption: referred to as like brainwave data and

00:09:31.119 --> 00:09:36.549
Caption: I&#39;ve used that to just project it onto

00:09:33.778 --> 00:09:37.899
Caption: the canvas using the techniques that I

00:09:36.549 --> 00:09:40.119
Caption: talked about before so there&#39;s simple

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:43.330
Caption: techniques of just positioning different

00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:45.250
Caption: dots and shapes on a canvas and then

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:48.580
Caption: instead of time data instead what I&#39;ve

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:50.770
Caption: done is projected my own brain data onto

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.710
Caption: a canvas to come up with some weird

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:59.080
Caption: looking thanks now a couple of caveats

00:09:53.710 --> 00:10:01.570
Caption: about this I built this as a kind of

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.230
Caption: prototype to experiment with this kind

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.049
Caption: of technology

00:10:02.229 --> 00:10:07.299
Caption: this particular headset aside from not

00:10:05.049 --> 00:10:12.459
Caption: connecting to computers during live

00:10:07.299 --> 00:10:15.070
Caption: demos is also not the quality of the

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.920
Caption: reading is not particularly what&#39;s the

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:20.919
Caption: word - ility so there are versions of

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:22.380
Caption: this technology that give you a precise

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:25.179
Caption: enough reading that you can apply

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:27.190
Caption: machine learning to it and move a cursor

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:29.109
Caption: out of screen for instance I actually

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:34.030
Caption: read a headline the other day that some

00:10:29.109 --> 00:10:36.099
Caption: researchers have transcribed thought to

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:39.850
Caption: speech no like thought to text for the

00:10:36.099 --> 00:10:42.219
Caption: first time using EEG headsets and

00:10:39.849 --> 00:10:43.269
Caption: machine learning which I don&#39;t know

00:10:42.219 --> 00:10:45.458
Caption: about you actually find that quite

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:47.650
Caption: terrifying because I kind of like my

00:10:45.458 --> 00:10:50.380
Caption: thoughts for the most part being inside

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:55.300
Caption: my own mind rather than I don&#39;t know on

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:58.840
Caption: Facebook but I feel like because this

00:10:55.299 --> 00:11:00.700
Caption: prototype is is much more artistic in

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.559
Caption: it&#39;s implementation it&#39;s not really

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:06.070
Caption: supposed to be a super scientific thing

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:09.219
Caption: that is perfectly reading my emotion

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.809
Caption: levels if I had a live demonstration up

00:11:09.219 --> 00:11:12.699
Caption: and running I could show you when i if

00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:16.359
Caption: i&#39;m walking around the stage and if I&#39;m

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:19.960
Caption: um if I&#39;m gesturing then it will become

00:11:16.359 --> 00:11:22.029
Caption: quite active and if I&#39;m sort of sitting

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.760
Caption: there quietly it will become less active

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.500
Caption: and I kind of asked someone to like say

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:30.669
Caption: boo at me halfway through and like go

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:34.419
Caption: pretty crazy but you know down to like

00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:36.669
Caption: the level that I guess where you could

00:11:34.419 --> 00:11:38.109
Caption: actually use it to issue commands and

00:11:36.669 --> 00:11:39.940
Caption: that kind of thing this tecnique like

00:11:38.109 --> 00:11:41.679
Caption: this hardware is just not that precise

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.619
Caption: then again I did get this for free and

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:50.669
Caption: even if you bought it there only about

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:53.049
Caption: 90 bucks so I I I wouldn&#39;t make any

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:54.429
Caption: scientific claims or anything on that

00:11:53.049 --> 00:11:55.809
Caption: kind of headset in fact on their website

00:11:54.429 --> 00:11:59.130
Caption: they&#39;re explicitly like don&#39;t use this

00:11:55.809 --> 00:12:02.830
Caption: for medical purposes so don&#39;t do that

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:04.419
Caption: so again if it&#39;s not for producing any

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.670
Caption: kind of scientific output if we&#39;re not

00:12:04.419 --> 00:12:08.979
Caption: making anything useful with it then why

00:12:06.669 --> 00:12:10.779
Caption: bother the main reason I built this was

00:12:08.979 --> 00:12:12.880
Caption: to trick children into thinking that

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.920
Caption: computer science was cool and that they

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.489
Caption: might want to study it at uni with them

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:20.049
Caption: mixed results really it&#39;s really hard to

00:12:18.489 --> 00:12:22.959
Caption: trick children to thinking anything is

00:12:20.049 --> 00:12:24.580
Caption: cool but it&#39;s mainly to illustrate this

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.950
Caption: concept that I talked about at the start

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.730
Caption: of my speech which is that I don&#39;t

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.750
Caption: really think that you have scientific

00:12:29.729 --> 00:12:33.579
Caption: mathematical things computer science on

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.830
Caption: one side and then artistic pursuits on

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.910
Caption: the other I think human beings are good

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.140
Caption: at lots of different things and

00:12:36.909 --> 00:12:39.729
Caption: sometimes it&#39;s really fun to combine

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.520
Caption: those together and come up with some

00:12:39.729 --> 00:12:43.869
Caption: interesting results I am because I go

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.700
Caption: out to schools and I talk about this

00:12:43.869 --> 00:12:47.799
Caption: technology I asked the classroom of

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.559
Caption: people these of these young girls in

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:51.700
Caption: about 14 I said does anyone here do two

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:53.409
Caption: different things like I do I do

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.549
Caption: programming I do art does anyone do two

00:12:53.409 --> 00:12:56.559
Caption: different things and I got some really

00:12:54.549 --> 00:12:59.709
Caption: interesting results one girl was like I

00:12:56.559 --> 00:13:05.890
Caption: play the violin and I do boxing and I

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:08.200
Caption: was like so what I&#39;d really like to see

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:10.900
Caption: going forward is people bringing in some

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.790
Caption: more diverse skill sets into

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.869
Caption: computer programming because I think

00:13:12.789 --> 00:13:16.269
Caption: there&#39;s some really interesting ways

00:13:13.869 --> 00:13:18.909
Caption: that you can combine different skills

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:20.410
Caption: with with a programmatic or application

00:13:18.909 --> 00:13:22.269
Caption: it doesn&#39;t always result in something

00:13:20.409 --> 00:13:24.699
Caption: that&#39;s necessarily going to earn money

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:30.100
Caption: but sometimes it&#39;s just cool and I think

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:32.200
Caption: that&#39;s kind of fun maybe I think I only

00:13:30.099 --> 00:13:35.079
Caption: ran for about 15 minutes so if anyone

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:51.910
Caption: has any questions that would be lovely I

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:53.140
Caption: guess no so I work with the platform

00:13:51.909 --> 00:13:54.759
Caption: that sort of helps educate children

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.679
Caption: about the climate change and its

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.359
Caption: difference there do you see things like

00:13:56.679 --> 00:14:00.429
Caption: this is a way to get more young people

00:13:58.359 --> 00:14:04.539
Caption: into coding and programming a software

00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:07.838
Caption: development I try so many ways to get

00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:09.278
Caption: children into coding what I found really

00:14:07.838 --> 00:14:13.450
Caption: interesting when I when I go and talk to

00:14:09.278 --> 00:14:14.919
Caption: kids and if you ask them about what what

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.869
Caption: are you thinking about technology and

00:14:14.919 --> 00:14:18.639
Caption: what are you scared of and how do you

00:14:16.869 --> 00:14:20.650
Caption: feel about stuff they&#39;re already

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.880
Caption: thinking really deeply about a lot of

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.890
Caption: questions they&#39;re thinking about climate

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.359
Caption: change and they&#39;re thinking about AI and

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.528
Caption: stuff like that I went to a school and I

00:14:25.359 --> 00:14:28.419
Caption: was like oh what are you worried about

00:14:26.528 --> 00:14:30.700
Caption: with technology and this little boy was

00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:32.349
Caption: like what if I go to uni and I study

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:36.309
Caption: really hard but then when I finish a

00:14:32.349 --> 00:14:36.940
Caption: robot does my job and I was like next

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:40.539
Caption: question please

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:42.070
Caption: and I know the kid was like so is robots

00:14:40.539 --> 00:14:43.329
Caption: taking everyone&#39;s job is that gonna be

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.770
Caption: really good because he won&#39;t have to do

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.390
Caption: any work or will it be really bad

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:52.390
Caption: because no one will have jobs and I was

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:54.250
Caption: like yes that is what will happen so in

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:57.220
Caption: terms of climate change I definitely

00:14:54.250 --> 00:15:00.909
Caption: hear kids like talking about these two

00:14:57.219 --> 00:15:03.278
Caption: concepts I don&#39;t there are lots of

00:15:00.909 --> 00:15:05.500
Caption: different ways to get young people into

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:07.239
Caption: coding and I don&#39;t always know what has

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.739
Caption: the best hit rate like I&#39;m a lot of

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:10.809
Caption: enthusiasm for it I don&#39;t know I always

00:15:08.739 --> 00:15:12.880
Caption: know if it lands I found one of the most

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:17.349
Caption: engaging things you can do is introduce

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:19.030
Caption: a use for what they&#39;re building whether

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:20.679
Caption: that&#39;s something to do with a big global

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.300
Caption: cause or if it&#39;s just something that

00:15:20.679 --> 00:15:23.528
Caption: they can use in their day to day life I

00:15:22.299 --> 00:15:26.198
Caption: went out to

00:15:23.528 --> 00:15:27.398
Caption: some kids near Rockingham and we just

00:15:26.198 --> 00:15:30.369
Caption: showed them how to make like a basic

00:15:27.398 --> 00:15:31.659
Caption: HTML page and I was worried they weren&#39;t

00:15:30.369 --> 00:15:33.758
Caption: going to understand the concept but

00:15:31.659 --> 00:15:38.109
Caption: within five minutes someone had made his

00:15:33.758 --> 00:15:39.429
Caption: like top ten fortnight fax page so maybe

00:15:38.109 --> 00:15:41.708
Caption: we could redirect some of that energy

00:15:39.429 --> 00:15:44.948
Caption: towards some important global issues I

00:15:41.708 --> 00:15:46.448
Caption: don&#39;t know but yeah all right to answer

00:15:44.948 --> 00:15:47.198
Caption: your question if I knew how to make kids

00:15:46.448 --> 00:15:48.758
Caption: do programming

00:15:47.198 --> 00:15:53.498
Caption: I would I would tell you I tell everyone

00:15:48.758 --> 00:15:57.159
Caption: but it&#39;s a bit of a mixed bag we have

00:15:53.499 --> 00:16:04.600
Caption: time for a couple of more questions come

00:15:57.159 --> 00:16:07.568
Caption: on ask me questions really actually good

00:16:04.599 --> 00:16:10.208
Caption: to see that how beautiful it is and I

00:16:07.568 --> 00:16:12.938
Caption: directly idea actually come out at from

00:16:10.208 --> 00:16:14.349
Caption: the first talk is from the Web API you

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:16.809
Caption: can actually integrate with the speaker

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:21.058
Caption: and in my mind is like you can directly

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:23.259
Caption: do sound like music visualized musical

00:16:21.059 --> 00:16:25.540
Caption: visualization and directly on the

00:16:23.258 --> 00:16:29.018
Caption: website that potentially can help the

00:16:25.539 --> 00:16:33.068
Caption: kids I think the combination of arts and

00:16:29.018 --> 00:16:36.669
Caption: and computer science it just display is

00:16:33.068 --> 00:16:38.948
Caption: such a beautiful and a simple way this

00:16:36.669 --> 00:16:41.229
Caption: is not a question but just just so it&#39;s

00:16:38.948 --> 00:16:44.378
Caption: just a direct feedback and and which is

00:16:41.229 --> 00:16:47.679
Caption: one to give to you yes yeah thank you no

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:49.329
Caption: worries I think it is like making it

00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:51.518
Caption: something that people can interact with

00:16:49.328 --> 00:16:53.018
Caption: in different ways really grabs people&#39;s

00:16:51.518 --> 00:16:56.138
Caption: attention so whether that&#39;s through

00:16:53.018 --> 00:16:57.849
Caption: music or through them moving around in

00:16:56.138 --> 00:17:00.338
Caption: front of something or putting a headset

00:16:57.849 --> 00:17:04.078
Caption: on they find it very engaging so pretty

00:17:00.338 --> 00:17:04.078
Caption: cool to me anyway honey

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.789
Caption: seems I&#39;m just barging straight through

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:26.979
Caption: hi so you&#39;re pretty multidisciplinary

00:17:22.928 --> 00:17:29.919
Caption: skilled I think but I&#39;d say quite a lot

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:33.609
Caption: of people are quite specific in their

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:36.970
Caption: domains of knowledge and there&#39;s often a

00:17:33.609 --> 00:17:40.390
Caption: difficulty in in connecting the arts

00:17:36.969 --> 00:17:43.109
Caption: with engineering fields and scientific

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:47.579
Caption: fields do you have any thoughts on

00:17:43.109 --> 00:17:49.750
Caption: avenues of approach which involve

00:17:47.579 --> 00:17:52.539
Caption: connecting artists with programmers

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:54.790
Caption: rather than artists who are programmers

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.880
Caption: or programmers who are artists sort of

00:17:54.790 --> 00:18:01.739
Caption: like ways to encourage collaboration and

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:04.900
Caption: stuff like that yeah one thing that I

00:18:01.739 --> 00:18:06.699
Caption: try and do with my limited spare time is

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:10.270
Caption: a bit of mentoring in the community and

00:18:06.699 --> 00:18:13.659
Caption: teaching people about programming and I

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:15.160
Caption: also have a lot of friends that they&#39;re

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.040
Caption: creators they really like they love to

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.390
Caption: make stuff and build things and I

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.910
Caption: definitely have a lot of plans in my

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:24.640
Caption: mind about like okay how can we teach

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:27.450
Caption: those creators how to use programming to

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:30.219
Caption: put some of those ideas into practice

00:18:27.449 --> 00:18:34.689
Caption: practically I can&#39;t really run so many

00:18:30.219 --> 00:18:36.609
Caption: workshops like but it&#39;s definitely I&#39;ve

00:18:34.689 --> 00:18:39.909
Caption: felt in in the Perth art community and

00:18:36.609 --> 00:18:41.410
Caption: in the like Perth like performing arts

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.150
Caption: community and music communities like

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:45.340
Caption: there is a big when I talk about this

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.989
Caption: stuff people are so interested so I

00:18:45.339 --> 00:18:49.808
Caption: think to answer your question is like I

00:18:46.989 --> 00:18:51.548
Caption: need to run stuff and invite weirdo

00:18:49.808 --> 00:18:54.789
Caption: creator types that I know and encourage

00:18:51.548 --> 00:18:58.058
Caption: them to dip their toe in this hold field

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:59.440
Caption: I think it&#39;s a bit I I think it&#39;s not

00:18:58.058 --> 00:19:01.599
Caption: quite a matter of like I don&#39;t want to

00:18:59.439 --> 00:19:03.069
Caption: necessarily force computer programs to

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:05.798
Caption: be like oh you have to become more

00:19:03.069 --> 00:19:07.298
Caption: artistic or more musical it&#39;s more that

00:19:05.798 --> 00:19:08.889
Caption: I want to make programming seem more

00:19:07.298 --> 00:19:11.139
Caption: approachable so people from lots of

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:13.630
Caption: different backgrounds can try it out and

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.099
Caption: do different things although you know if

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.359
Caption: people want to do art I&#39;m like go for it

00:19:15.099 --> 00:19:20.709
Caption: everyone should do oh it&#39;s really fun

00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:22.890
Caption: thank you so much Alice please join me

00:19:20.709 --> 00:19:27.989
Caption: for one last round of applause thank you
