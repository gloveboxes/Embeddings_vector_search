Caption: with all that going on so modern

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:59.339
Caption: workplaces have trended towards these

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.229
Caption: open-plan working environments and the

00:01:59.339 --> 00:02:03.208
Caption: people who plan these workspaces do it

00:02:01.228 --> 00:02:05.548
Caption: for a number of reasons but mainly they

00:02:03.208 --> 00:02:06.988
Caption: think that people collaborate more

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.160
Caption: efficiently in this sort of environment

00:02:06.988 --> 00:02:12.899
Caption: and they also do it because they don&#39;t

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.059
Caption: have to put up internal walls or

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:17.000
Caption: partitions and move them around as the

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:20.729
Caption: structure of their organization changes

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.009
Caption: to workplace planners open-plan working

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:26.069
Caption: is a win-win situation there are no

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:29.098
Caption: downsides but what they fail to

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.339
Caption: recognize is that only about half the

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:37.610
Caption: human population work positively under

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:39.238
Caption: these conditions in the 1920s a

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.238
Caption: psychologist called car young

00:02:39.238 --> 00:02:44.509
Caption: popularized a theory it was a theory of

00:02:42.238 --> 00:02:48.449
Caption: the personality trait continuum

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:50.220
Caption: it was the theory that people&#39;s people&#39;s

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.988
Caption: personalities can be categorized between

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.348
Caption: two extremes between introversion and

00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:57.539
Caption: extraversion you know the theory is

00:02:55.348 --> 00:02:59.759
Caption: actually quite detailed and that&#39;s too

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:01.708
Caption: complicated to be absorbed into common

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.988
Caption: knowledge so what happens is that public

00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:06.378
Caption: popular culture has distilled it down

00:03:03.988 --> 00:03:09.750
Caption: into three generalizations that

00:03:06.378 --> 00:03:14.638
Caption: extroverts energetic outgoing and social

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:19.229
Caption: people that introverts shy reserved in

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:22.769
Caption: solitary people and that people only

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:26.699
Caption: exist in one point all the time along

00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:29.848
Caption: this continuum now these interpretations

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:31.078
Caption: are useful but also very damaging they

00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:34.048
Caption: give us a basic understanding of what

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:36.138
Caption: personality traits are but they ignore

00:03:34.048 --> 00:03:38.759
Caption: the properties of the continuum that

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.799
Caption: personalities exist along this infinite

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:43.229
Caption: spectrum between the extremes of

00:03:40.798 --> 00:03:45.448
Caption: introversion and extraversion and that

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:49.738
Caption: one person while remaining in a general

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:52.230
Caption: area will move around over time by

00:03:49.738 --> 00:03:53.970
Caption: misinterpreting the theory people draw

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:56.518
Caption: poor conclusions about how people

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.680
Caption: respond to certain situations conditions

00:03:56.518 --> 00:04:03.328
Caption: and stimuli up to 40% of the population

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:04.500
Caption: identifies introverts and the list of

00:04:03.328 --> 00:04:06.708
Caption: some of the common behavior of

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.029
Caption: introverts aren&#39;t shown on the board

00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:11.220
Caption: because the personality trait continuum

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.809
Caption: is a spectrum even extra greats my

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.380
Caption: identify was some of these some others

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:18.000
Caption: are as an introvert myself identify with

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.940
Caption: almost all of these all of the time

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.489
Caption: I want to single this one am particular

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.860
Caption: too much stimulation leaves you feeling

00:04:23.489 --> 00:04:27.299
Caption: distracted and unfocused and I want to

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:29.638
Caption: read a quote from the article that this

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:30.959
Caption: came from I think it sums up the

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.460
Caption: difference between introverts and

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:37.449
Caption: experts and introverts and extroverts

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:39.209
Caption: perfectly unlike extroverts who gain

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.980
Caption: energy from social interaction

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:44.739
Caption: introverts expend energy in social

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.440
Caption: situations after spending time in a

00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:49.509
Caption: large group of people introverts often

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.220
Caption: feel the need to recharge by spending a

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.600
Caption: period of time alone now I can

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.670
Caption: personally vouch for the effects of

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.070
Caption: being an introvert working in our open

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.570
Caption: plant working environment years of

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.240
Caption: working under these conditions affected

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.160
Caption: me mentally and physically I was like a

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:07.630
Caption: slow boiling frog I could feel something

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.450
Caption: was happening but I didn&#39;t know what it

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.750
Caption: was and the Simpsons grew a year-by-year

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.750
Caption: I could only identify those symptoms so

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.570
Caption: I was exhausted almost constantly I was

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.630
Caption: stressed and easily irritated beyond my

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.309
Caption: breaking point and I couldn&#39;t perform my

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.520
Caption: work duties to the standard that I knew

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:28.660
Caption: that I was capable of I come to loathe

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:30.549
Caption: going to work every day

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.320
Caption: now I practice mindfulness and that does

00:05:30.549 --> 00:05:34.659
Caption: help alleviate some of the symptoms but

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.970
Caption: the effects are fleeting for the first

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.250
Caption: time in my life I ended up needing to

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.790
Caption: take medication to manage my anxiety

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.109
Caption: levels just because I was going to work

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.690
Caption: it made me feel like a failure as a

00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:48.219
Caption: human being to see others thriving in

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.540
Caption: this environment while I was struggling

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.130
Caption: just to survive it&#39;s irresponsible for

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.020
Caption: employers to not provide adequate

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.720
Caption: working conditions for all of their

00:05:56.019 --> 00:06:00.789
Caption: employees yeah I met resistance when I

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.579
Caption: was proposing changes to the perfect

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.570
Caption: open plan model that and the perceived

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:07.689
Caption: benefits that have brought the

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.770
Caption: organization I found myself unable to

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.709
Caption: convince my employer to change

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:14.500
Caption: environment and I was unable to continue

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:16.899
Caption: working under those conditions so I took

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.850
Caption: the difficult decision to leave before

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:20.290
Caption: things really got out of hand it was a

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.240
Caption: difficult decision because I was leaving

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.790
Caption: behind ten years of great achievements I

00:06:22.239 --> 00:06:26.529
Caption: was leaving behind a reputation for

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.839
Caption: being able to succeed in the face of

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:30.190
Caption: extreme adversity and I was leaving

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:33.660
Caption: behind more friendship than I&#39;ve ever

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.660
Caption: had and any other time in my life

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:40.628
Caption: so with a decision made I began to find

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.089
Caption: in what I wanted for my future employer

00:06:40.628 --> 00:06:45.338
Caption: and I focused on what made me happiest

00:06:43.088 --> 00:06:47.679
Caption: at work in the past in the workplaces I

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:49.239
Caption: had been happiest in the past for me

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:51.098
Caption: this meant working at a small company

00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:53.648
Caption: that was making software for a lot of

00:06:51.098 --> 00:06:56.378
Caption: people where I could use all of my

00:06:53.648 --> 00:06:57.998
Caption: skills and experience we&#39;re colleagues

00:06:56.378 --> 00:07:00.519
Caption: openly cared for each other

00:06:57.998 --> 00:07:02.769
Caption: and for the customers and where people

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:06.398
Caption: didn&#39;t drag each other down for favor or

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:08.528
Caption: reward within the company so fortunately

00:07:06.398 --> 00:07:09.489
Caption: I didn&#39;t have to wait very long thanks

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:12.009

Caption: heading to a bright future together

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:38.588
Caption: now lending a remote job is fantastic

00:07:36.188 --> 00:07:39.838
Caption: but being effective and successful limit

00:07:38.588 --> 00:07:42.278
Caption: is not guaranteed

00:07:39.838 --> 00:07:44.558
Caption: after hearing stories from conferences

00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:45.789
Caption: like this and from friends I had a good

00:07:44.558 --> 00:07:48.039
Caption: idea of some of their challenges I was

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:51.398
Caption: going to face going into it now I&#39;m a

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:53.739
Caption: proactive preparer so I came up with a

00:07:51.398 --> 00:07:56.918
Caption: simple action plan I was gonna make my

00:07:53.739 --> 00:08:00.039
Caption: environment work for me I was gonna make

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:02.559
Caption: my tools work for me and I was gonna

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:05.860
Caption: establish a strong digital presence so I

00:08:02.558 --> 00:08:07.838
Caption: overcome the lack of a physical one so

00:08:05.859 --> 00:08:09.038
Caption: after a year I draw blood so far I&#39;m

00:08:07.838 --> 00:08:09.789
Caption: happy to say that this approach is

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:12.519
Caption: working great

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:15.398
Caption: I either transition into remote working

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:17.259
Caption: and I succeed at exceeding the

00:08:15.398 --> 00:08:20.228
Caption: expectations of my colleagues every day

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:22.419
