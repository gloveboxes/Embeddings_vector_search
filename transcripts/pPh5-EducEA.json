  "description": "What is all this talk about quantum computers and quantum computing?  Will I have to learn a new programming language?  What does it mean for our enterprise apps?  Our startup?  My games?  My job?\\n\\nQuantum computing is a fascinating topic that will change the world of computing and, probably, even our world.  It can be technical but don\u2019t worry, we will make it easy to understand what you need to know.  \\n\\nThis talk will give a clear and simple introduction to quantum computing and explain the current state of play, services that are currently available, and what we can expect in the future, e.g. how it will affect IT jobs.\\n\\nIt\u2019s all from a developer\u2019s perspective and for developers but it will be understandable by anyone interested.  \\n\\nWith an Honours Degree in Theoretical Physics, a PhD in Computer Science and Software Engineering, and many years experience in IS an IT, I have the knowledge to be able to bridge the gap between the physics, computing, and software to help you understand Quantum Computing. \\nAshley is a software developer, entrepreneur, academic and professional trainer.  \\n\\nHe has a PhD in Computer Science and Software Engineering from UNSW and 25 years experience in the IT industry.  For his startup he\u0027s using a very distributed microservices architecture with CQRS/ES on the backend, written in Scala and quite functionally-oriented, and React/JavaScript for multiple frontend SPAs.  It\u0027s deployed within Docker containers and using Docker Swarm.\\n\\nHe has delivered training courses around Australia, across SE Asia and in the US and UK for multi-national computer companies like Apple, IBM, HP and others, including CBA and Woodside Energy.  He has won awards and recognition from the ICT industry, academia, the federal government, and the student community for the quality and excellence of his teaching and professional training.  \\n\\nHe is the co-founder of Acavista, an edtech startup, and principal for Innovately.com.au, which helps with the application of Lean Startup and Customer Development principles and practices to the commercialisation of innovation in organisations from any sector, of any size, and at any level of maturity (not just startups).  He graduated from the Founder Institute and Curtin Accelerate startup accelerators."
