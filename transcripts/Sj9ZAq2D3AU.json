  "description": "A pythonic introduction to building bots when you are starting from *scratch*.  In this talk we\u0027ll look at how they work, what they can be used for, and see some demo\u0027s to play with.\\n\\nImagine you have a 100 days and your only directive is that you **must** spend at least an hour a day in the code. Could you build an army of bots and take over the world?\\n \\nRecently I\u0027ve taken part in the #100DaysOfCode Challenge, which is designed to help beginners get started with meaningful and fun activities, even when they have no previous knowledge.\\n \\nTogether we\u0027ll cover the basics of bot building and go under the hood to look at the code and the basic architecture that holds it together. We\u0027ll examine some of the bots you can build and by the end of the session you\u0027ll be able to start building your own robot minions.\\n\\nTedx Speaker, Tech Girl Superhero, Microsoftie and one of MCV\u0027s 30 Most Influential Women in Games. I am a Technology Evangelist who acts as an API between technology and the world. I advocate for STEM, the Games Industry and Developers. I present at around 50 Conferences and Events around the world on Technology, Social Media, Inclusion and Gaming."
