  "description": "Improving the codebase for the next developer is a great goal, but what about making the industry better for the next generation? In this talk, Kris will debunk some of the damaging myths and ideas we\u2019re all guilty of perpetuating, the ones that lead to stress and burnout. Fortunately there is an antidote - becoming a mentor! You\u2019ll learn how you can change your own behaviour and thinking, be more supportive to those just starting out, and feel more engaged and inspired in your work - all with minimal effort. We all have a responsibility to make things just a little bit better for those who come after us."
