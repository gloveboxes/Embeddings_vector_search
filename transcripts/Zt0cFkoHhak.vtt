00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.979
Caption: done a couple of very bad hardware and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.360
Caption: software startups

00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:46.739
Caption: that I don&#39;t talk about too much at

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.199
Caption: parties

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:50.938

Caption: avoid those sorts of problems

00:02:16.738 --> 00:02:19.559
Caption: um

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.899

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.919
Caption: yeah that&#39;s what I do and also I&#39;m going

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:23.639
Caption: to talk about this a little bit at the

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.679
Caption: end

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.238
Caption: um I&#39;m a trainer at a company called

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:29.699
Caption: stack mechanics which I&#39;ll talk a little

00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:31.619
Caption: bit about later on essentially to help

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:33.539
Caption: people you know in larger groups to

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:35.458
Caption: avoid some of these mistakes

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:38.339
Caption: uh ramblings is the first time back for

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:39.539
Caption: a while all right so the agenda today

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.500
Caption: um

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.979
Caption: I&#39;m gonna give you a little bit of

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.738
Caption: background and historical context

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:48.300
Caption: um about microservices because I&#39;m a big

00:02:46.738 --> 00:02:49.378
Caption: believer that in understanding the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.660
Caption: history of something you can kind of

00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:54.179
Caption: understand what problem it&#39;s solving and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.160
Caption: you know why we might want to do that

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:58.439
Caption: um I&#39;m going to talk about some of the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.419
Caption: mistakes that I see and the impact of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.919
Caption: those mistakes that I&#39;ve seen and then

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.679
Caption: some of the principles and techniques

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.940
Caption: and and thinking and design principles

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:07.079
Caption: to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.419
Caption: um

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.919
Caption: not make those mistakes and I&#39;m going to

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.080
Caption: get into some of the sort of tech stack

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:15.300
Caption: details but um essentially it&#39;s more

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.779
Caption: around conceptual stuff

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.779
Caption: so

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:20.839
Caption: some background

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:27.720
Caption: for a lot of years with with ratify

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:29.639
Caption: and also my solo consulting stuff we&#39;d

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.958
Caption: often kind of go into the burning

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.059
Caption: building

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:36.539
Caption: rescue stuff

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:38.339
Caption: um and often in those situations you get

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.839
Caption: to a point where people are like we need

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:41.339
Caption: guarantees that this is going to work

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.919
Caption: and you know we can&#39;t guarantee anything

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:46.080
Caption: because everything&#39;s on fire so what we

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.458
Caption: started to do you know and and you know

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.378
Caption: these sorts of approaches over the last

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:52.199
Caption: 10 12 13 years

00:03:49.378 --> 00:03:53.819
Caption: is you can&#39;t make big promises so what

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.440
Caption: we would do is ship something really

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.518
Caption: small really quickly and then ship

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.559
Caption: something else really small really

00:03:56.518 --> 00:04:00.779
Caption: quickly to kind of get some runs on the

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:01.738
Caption: board and and prove things

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:04.080
Caption: um

00:04:01.738 --> 00:04:05.878
Caption: and you know these patterns that we sort

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.598
Caption: of took out of that

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:08.098
Caption: um

00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:09.598
Caption: eventually became you know called

00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:11.119
Caption: microservices

00:04:09.598 --> 00:04:14.158
Caption: lots of Tooling in the sort of

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:16.199
Caption: infrastructure octopus deploy and and

00:04:14.158 --> 00:04:18.000
Caption: cerealog and some of the sort of tools

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.459
Caption: that as.net developers I&#39;m assuming most

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.380
Caption: people here.net Developers

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.880
Caption: about half okay cool

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.380
Caption: um it&#39;s almost came out of that space

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.759
Caption: where we&#39;re just like getting in as a

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.679
Caption: consultancy and having to solve problems

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.179
Caption: really really quickly

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:31.739
Caption: um

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:33.660
Caption: so

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:35.279
Caption: that&#39;s part of the background of why I

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.040
Caption: like microservices the other part of

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:39.779
Caption: this talk is we are in a very hype

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.940
Caption: driven industry you would probably know

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.540
Caption: this yes

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.399
Caption: um

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.479
Caption: and it&#39;s very cyclic as well and sort of

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:48.419
Caption: part of my

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.399
Caption: advantage of being you know in tech for

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.100
Caption: 20 something years is you start to see

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:54.540
Caption: the same bad ideas recycle with new

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.360
Caption: names and you&#39;ll see a couple of nods

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.460
Caption: here you go yes and

00:04:57.359 --> 00:05:00.959
Caption: you know sometimes those those ideas get

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:02.519
Caption: renamed it&#39;s like this is a great new

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:04.500
Caption: thing and I kind of you know put on my

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:06.899
Caption: grumpy old man pants I&#39;m like no we&#39;ve

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.299
Caption: done that you know

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:10.559
Caption: and and what happens is

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:11.940
Caption: everyone&#39;s kind of jumps on these

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:13.139
Caption: bandwagons and they write blog posts

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.699
Caption: because everyone wants to kind of get

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.899
Caption: noticed for Stuff

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.220
Caption: um and you&#39;ve got blog posts like oh

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.660
Caption: this is an amazing thing and people want

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.160
Caption: to get on Hacker News and companies

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.779
Caption: wanted to attract Talent you know we&#39;ll

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.959
Caption: do posts

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:26.699
Caption: um about how they how they did things

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:28.380
Caption: um my favorite is Uber engineering&#39;s

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.820
Caption: blog because every couple of years they

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.839
Caption: change everything and write a blog post

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.979
Caption: about it

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:34.440
Caption: um you know one year it was like we&#39;ve

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.239
Caption: moved away from postgres to mySQL

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.860
Caption: because it&#39;s faster and then two years

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:39.899
Caption: later they just finished that migration

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:41.459
Caption: go well no that was a bad idea we&#39;re

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:43.380
Caption: going back again

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:44.699
Caption: um and and that&#39;s kind of fine for Uber

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.139
Caption: because they&#39;re massive and they&#39;ve got

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.479
Caption: you know billions of dollars of venture

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.220
Caption: capital funding and most of us aren&#39;t

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.660
Caption: Uber we don&#39;t we can&#39;t afford to make

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.679
Caption: those mistakes and you know rebuild our

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.500
Caption: database

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:58.139
Caption: um every you know two years

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.880
Caption: um so yeah part of the problem is very

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.679
Caption: high driven everyone wants to be kind of

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.899
Caption: in on the latest thing

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:06.239
Caption: and we end up with this

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:08.339
Caption: so for anyone who can&#39;t see it as well

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:09.839
Caption: this is a sort of well-known meme

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:11.940
Caption: um of a dog sitting drinking a coffee

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:13.320
Caption: with flames all around him I&#39;m saying

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.119
Caption: this is fine

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.580
Caption: um and I&#39;m going to repeat this a few

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:19.320
Caption: times so if you sort of can&#39;t see the

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:20.819
Caption: slides and you hear me say this is fine

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.139
Caption: just picture the dog in the burning

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.880
Caption: building things that everything&#39;s all

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.639
Caption: good

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.160
Caption: um so yeah we built these things and it

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.020
Caption: ends up just in in a disaster and as

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.699
Caption: much as I love I actually quite enjoy as

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:34.859
Caption: a consultant you know going to the

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:37.020
Caption: burning building and picking stuff up I

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:38.339
Caption: I it&#39;s a sick satisfaction I get from it

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:40.679
Caption: it would be great for the entire

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:43.019
Caption: industry if we didn&#39;t do it if we didn&#39;t

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:45.179
Caption: set stuff on fire in the first place

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:48.119
Caption: um so my goal today is sort of I

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:49.799
Caption: understand why we might do microservices

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:51.959
Caption: um and and some of the thinking we need

00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:53.399
Caption: to do so that we can stop um setting

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:56.100
Caption: things on fire

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:58.259
Caption: all right so history

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.059
Caption: again this is one of these everything

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.380
Caption: old is new again

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:03.179
Caption: um

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.739
Caption: every idea in software is built on

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:06.660
Caption: something before it solving a problem

00:07:04.739 --> 00:07:08.339
Caption: before it so I want to sort of talk a

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.500
Caption: little bit about

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:14.059
Caption: um my version of the history of

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.059
Caption: microservices and

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:17.339
Caption: so

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:18.600
Caption: again there&#39;s some assumptions and

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:20.399
Caption: opinions here but I have you know

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.220
Caption: cross-checked this with a few people

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:25.559
Caption: so it started with something called SOA

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.779
Caption: service oriented architecture if you

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:29.940
Caption: know ingots

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:33.059
Caption: who was around when Soul was a thing

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.899
Caption: yeah good number good number

00:07:33.059 --> 00:07:37.440
Caption: um

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:41.339
Caption: so that was a cool idea and the idea was

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.259
Caption: that and this has been the early 2000s

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:46.199
Caption: um in the sort of.net space it was like

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:47.598
Caption: dot Net One soap was the great new thing

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:51.380
Caption: and web services

00:07:47.598 --> 00:07:51.380
Caption: a few people go oh

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:57.000
Caption: and the idea was good it was you had

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.819
Caption: Loosely coupled services

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.380
Caption: that that autonomously managed a

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:03.679
Caption: business process

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.598
Caption: and you could then build applications

00:08:03.679 --> 00:08:08.098
Caption: based on those services so you know you

00:08:06.598 --> 00:08:09.479
Caption: might have service a and service B and

00:08:08.098 --> 00:08:11.220
Caption: server C and service D and then

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:12.899
Caption: application a goes well I would like

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.459
Caption: that thing and that thing and that thing

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:15.839
Caption: and the applications that sit on top of

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:17.579
Caption: the services and big companies could

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:20.000
Caption: build that services and everything would

00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:20.000
Caption: be great

00:08:20.039 --> 00:08:23.639
Caption: it wasn&#39;t

00:08:22.019 --> 00:08:25.918
Caption: because what we&#39;d end up with

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:28.800
Caption: is something that looked a little bit

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:30.479
Caption: more like this where every service or

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:32.519
Caption: every application talks to every service

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:34.500
Caption: and every service talks to every other

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.598
Caption: service and they&#39;re usually all sitting

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.539
Caption: on top of a shared database

00:08:36.598 --> 00:08:41.098
Caption: and it was just a mess and a lot of this

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:43.260
Caption: was because we got the modeling wrong

00:08:41.098 --> 00:08:45.359
Caption: you know it was meant to be

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.458
Caption: an autonomous business process managed

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:50.338
Caption: by a service but typically it wasn&#39;t

00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:51.419
Caption: um the modeling got wrong and it wasn&#39;t

00:08:50.338 --> 00:08:54.059
Caption: self-contained at all it wasn&#39;t

00:08:51.419 --> 00:08:56.039
Caption: autonomous and everything you know

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:58.200
Caption: looked like this and from the last I

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:59.699
Caption: know a few a few of you have worked on

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.380
Caption: this sort of fun

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.940
Caption: um you know I worked on one where you

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.320
Caption: had a data manager service where they

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.179
Caption: sort of re-implemented a relational

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.919
Caption: database on top of a relational database

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:11.398
Caption: over soap

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:13.079
Caption: um and it looked a lot like this and

00:09:11.398 --> 00:09:15.239
Caption: every service needed to start in the

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.640
Caption: right order or the application would not

00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:19.260
Caption: work so then we had a service manager

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.540
Caption: run a service or something that made

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.458
Caption: sure that things got started in the

00:09:21.539 --> 00:09:27.059
Caption: right way

00:09:23.458 --> 00:09:28.919
Caption: um and it was bad so the software

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:30.239
Caption: industry came up with a great solution

00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:32.359
Caption: to this does anyone remember what that

00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:32.359
Caption: was

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:37.320
Caption: it was the Enterprise service bus

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.479
Caption: um

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.338
Caption: which was you know vendors came in we&#39;ll

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:43.440
Caption: solve these problems

00:09:41.338 --> 00:09:44.458
Caption: um and Enterprise service buses if you

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.720
Caption: don&#39;t remember they were they were

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:47.579
Caption: expensive

00:09:45.719 --> 00:09:50.579
Caption: um they were generally sold on golf

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.959
Caption: courses to cios and then just put in

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.059
Caption: place

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.200
Caption: is very triggering for you I can tell

00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:57.778
Caption: you

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.200
Caption: so and again the idea of an Enterprise

00:09:57.778 --> 00:10:04.200
Caption: service bus wasn&#39;t a bad one so the idea

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.419
Caption: is that we had our services and rather

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.799
Caption: than them all talking to each other they

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:09.958
Caption: would talk to this Enterprise service

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:12.299
Caption: bus and the applications would talk to

00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:14.039
Caption: the Enterprise service bus and the

00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:16.799
Caption: Enterprise service bus would figure out

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:18.719
Caption: where to Route requests and how to

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:21.119
Caption: translate them and whatever else

00:10:18.719 --> 00:10:24.359
Caption: and all of this

00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:26.700
Caption: um logic was in the hands of of business

00:10:24.359 --> 00:10:28.380
Caption: analysts and Enterprise Architects and

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:31.200
Caption: the idea is that the the developers

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.200
Caption: could just cut code on these Services

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.200
Caption: um

00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:37.919
Caption: the problem was

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.539
Caption: we ended up with so much logic in this

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:41.219
Caption: service bus

00:10:39.539 --> 00:10:42.419
Caption: um they became very fragile because

00:10:41.219 --> 00:10:45.199
Caption: essentially you&#39;re doing software

00:10:42.419 --> 00:10:47.398
Caption: development in a browser window

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.440
Caption: for this talk was a browser window that

00:10:47.398 --> 00:10:51.778
Caption: looked a lot like SharePoint writing

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.700
Caption: code in there without validation without

00:10:51.778 --> 00:10:55.619
Caption: testing things

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.299
Caption: um and so what happened was it became

00:10:55.619 --> 00:10:58.940
Caption: very fragile so nobody wanted to touch

00:10:57.299 --> 00:11:01.320
Caption: the logic in the Enterprise service bus

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:04.440
Caption: so as

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.220
Caption: agile developers what did we do we

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.220
Caption: routed around it

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.600
Caption: this is fine

00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:17.820
Caption: so

00:11:15.119 --> 00:11:19.979
Caption: what came next and this is my again this

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.958
Caption: is my memory of history and everyone&#39;s

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:24.000
Caption: memory of history is a little bit

00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.919
Caption: you know

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.219
Caption: Along Came

00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:31.078
Caption: um rest so essentially

00:11:29.219 --> 00:11:32.518
Caption: um there was a guy named Jim Webber who

00:11:31.078 --> 00:11:34.260
Caption: worked at a company called thoughtworks

00:11:32.518 --> 00:11:36.059
Caption: I&#39;m sure evidence of everyone here has

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.500
Caption: sort of thought Works yep so we&#39;re going

00:11:36.059 --> 00:11:40.559
Caption: to Jim Webber

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:43.078
Caption: um The Story Goes he was working on some

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:46.859
Caption: horrible rescue project sitting in a

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:48.838
Caption: data center trying to fix Biz talk at

00:11:46.859 --> 00:11:51.059
Caption: one in the morning and just where enough

00:11:48.838 --> 00:11:53.760
Caption: of this is terrible so he and a couple

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:55.140
Caption: of colleagues started to just go we&#39;re

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.820
Caption: not going to put some in this talk we&#39;re

00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:00.179
Caption: just going to build a service over here

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.799
Caption: in tomcat and just put an HTTP API on it

00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:04.140
Caption: and and we can call that and just kind

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:05.940
Caption: of you know

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.338
Caption: um separate some of those functionality

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.778
Caption: out and end up writing a book on rest

00:12:08.338 --> 00:12:11.880
Caption: called rest in practice I think really

00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:13.679
Caption: good book on rest and sort of it was

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.778
Caption: around the time that rest sort of became

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:17.760
Caption: popular and and you know thought work

00:12:15.778 --> 00:12:19.919
Caption: started to do a lot of stuff around

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.919
Caption: these HTTP Based Services that were

00:12:19.919 --> 00:12:27.320
Caption: simple built on I think Jetty

00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:27.320
Caption: um and and using rest and and hypertext

00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:32.398
Caption: um around the time I first heard the

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.018
Caption: term microservices it was sort of it&#39;s

00:12:32.398 --> 00:12:35.760
Caption: sort of emanating

00:12:34.018 --> 00:12:36.898
Caption: um from a company called SoundCloud I&#39;m

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.179
Caption: sure a lot of you heard of SoundCloud

00:12:36.898 --> 00:12:40.619
Caption: needed audio streaming and downloading

00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:43.219
Caption: stuff

00:12:40.619 --> 00:12:43.219
Caption: so

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:47.578
Caption: um

00:12:44.278 --> 00:12:48.838
Caption: SoundCloud had an application it was

00:12:47.578 --> 00:12:50.000
Caption: um it was getting big they were getting

00:12:48.838 --> 00:12:52.440
Caption: popular

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.320
Caption: and it was very monolithic very hard to

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.760
Caption: maintain wasn&#39;t scaling well so they

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.799
Caption: hired a bunch of people actually from

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.600
Caption: thoughtworks in Berlin

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:02.159
Caption: and one of the leaders there was a guy

00:13:00.599 --> 00:13:04.018
Caption: named Phil calcotto

00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:05.940
Caption: and so what they what Phil started to do

00:13:04.018 --> 00:13:08.039
Caption: with this team was was breaking stuff

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.659
Caption: off so I had this this big monolithic

00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:12.119
Caption: rails app and they&#39;d break some stuff

00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:14.219
Caption: off built a simple HTTP service over it

00:13:12.119 --> 00:13:16.760
Caption: and um you know and a few other people

00:13:14.219 --> 00:13:19.859
Caption: in that space were doing similar things

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.660
Caption: and eventually they became sort of known

00:13:19.859 --> 00:13:22.799
Caption: as microservices

00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:25.739
Caption: so

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:28.679
Caption: the historical sort of timeline here is

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:33.599
Caption: you can kind of go from sewer to bad

00:13:28.679 --> 00:13:35.458
Caption: sewer to http to rest to microservices

00:13:33.599 --> 00:13:36.719
Caption: and then a guy named Sam Newman who was

00:13:35.458 --> 00:13:38.398
Caption: also a thoughtworks wrote a book on it

00:13:36.719 --> 00:13:42.679
Caption: which I&#39;m sure a lot of people have seen

00:13:38.398 --> 00:13:42.679
Caption: and it kind of just exploded from there

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:50.940
Caption: but of course we ended up back here

00:13:48.719 --> 00:13:52.379
Caption: where we had lots of services a couple

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.059
Caption: of applications but all the services

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.940
Caption: talking to each other a lot of people

00:13:54.059 --> 00:14:00.958
Caption: did it again with a shared database and

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:03.059
Caption: got the modeling completely wrong

00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:06.059
Caption: and we ended up back here this is fine

00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:07.500
Caption: so who&#39;s worked on one of these in my in

00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:09.479
Caption: microservice land yeah a few people

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:13.380
Caption: right

00:14:09.479 --> 00:14:15.479
Caption: so that&#39;s the history so where does it

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.518
Caption: go wrong and this is you know I&#39;ve spent

00:14:15.479 --> 00:14:20.338
Caption: a lot of time digging out of this and

00:14:17.518 --> 00:14:23.638
Caption: and thinking about it

00:14:20.338 --> 00:14:25.799
Caption: and the first place that goes wrong

00:14:23.638 --> 00:14:26.820
Caption: is people get way too caught up in the

00:14:25.799 --> 00:14:28.440
Caption: tech

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.479
Caption: yeah and this is a

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.338
Caption: fairly common pattern in our industry

00:14:30.479 --> 00:14:34.919
Caption: you&#39;ve got a problem to solve

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:36.479
Caption: you start a project everyone&#39;s excited

00:14:34.919 --> 00:14:38.760
Caption: you still don&#39;t really know what the

00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:41.000
Caption: business requirements are because that&#39;s

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.078
Caption: someone else&#39;s job as a developer

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.578
Caption: and so we&#39;re like we&#39;re sitting here we

00:14:43.078 --> 00:14:46.679
Caption: don&#39;t know what to do I know we&#39;ll build

00:14:44.578 --> 00:14:49.380
Caption: our own framework and we&#39;ll build our

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:51.179
Caption: own orm and we&#39;ll build out whatever and

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.458
Caption: so

00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:55.198
Caption: in in in more recent years people then

00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:57.059
Caption: get really hung up on the infrastructure

00:14:55.198 --> 00:14:59.099
Caption: it&#39;s like right we need to build a thing

00:14:57.059 --> 00:15:01.320
Caption: it&#39;s like cool first we need to do is

00:14:59.099 --> 00:15:03.359
Caption: get kubernetes and put Kafka and

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.679
Caption: postgres and kubernetes and just get way

00:15:03.359 --> 00:15:06.898
Caption: hung up on the infrastructure before

00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:08.698
Caption: shipping a loan of code

00:15:06.898 --> 00:15:10.078
Caption: and essentially you start solving

00:15:08.698 --> 00:15:12.000
Caption: problems that you don&#39;t have yet you

00:15:10.078 --> 00:15:13.500
Caption: don&#39;t know you&#39;re going to have yet

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Caption: um you know tools are great all of those

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.698
Caption: tools that I mentioned are fantastic

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.338
Caption: tools and fantastic infrastructure but

00:15:17.698 --> 00:15:22.859
Caption: um if you

00:15:20.338 --> 00:15:25.919
Caption: start layering on stuff before you&#39;ve

00:15:22.859 --> 00:15:27.659
Caption: even understand the problem you probably

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:29.338
Caption: need to stop

00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:30.898
Caption: it&#39;s kind of agile one-on-one right like

00:15:29.338 --> 00:15:32.940
Caption: we don&#39;t do big design up front a lot of

00:15:30.898 --> 00:15:35.039
Caption: people do it like a map I saw one

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.380
Caption: recently there&#39;s some tool

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:40.198
Caption: it&#39;s like a graph like a graphing tool

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:42.898
Caption: for sort of object graphs and like a

00:15:40.198 --> 00:15:45.898
Caption: team that had not actually shipped

00:15:42.898 --> 00:15:47.458
Caption: the system and the object graph of

00:15:45.898 --> 00:15:48.958
Caption: services was like I couldn&#39;t fit in on

00:15:47.458 --> 00:15:50.578
Caption: my monitor and they&#39;d never actually

00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:52.198
Caption: shipped anything this has got way hung

00:15:50.578 --> 00:15:55.380
Caption: up on stuff and just solving problems

00:15:52.198 --> 00:15:57.239
Caption: that you know they didn&#39;t have yet

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.500
Caption: so sometimes when I&#39;m feeling snarky

00:15:57.239 --> 00:16:00.838
Caption: I&#39;ll say to people if you haven&#39;t

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.599
Caption: shipped one thing what makes you think

00:16:00.838 --> 00:16:06.059
Caption: you can ship 20 tomorrow

00:16:03.599 --> 00:16:07.440
Caption: and that makes me popular

00:16:06.059 --> 00:16:08.820
Caption: yeah I&#39;ve never had this conversation

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.958
Caption: like right we need to start this thing

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.979
Caption: it&#39;s like first thing we need to do is

00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.719
Caption: choose a container orchestration

00:16:10.979 --> 00:16:14.219
Caption: platforms like well you really don&#39;t you

00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:16.379
Caption: actually have a bunch of stuff over here

00:16:14.219 --> 00:16:18.059
Caption: your legacy system it&#39;s a bunch of

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.440
Caption: servers and you know there&#39;s a proof of

00:16:18.059 --> 00:16:20.638
Caption: concept like let&#39;s see if we can ship a

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.799
Caption: small thing

00:16:20.638 --> 00:16:25.099
Caption: and um you know so people just way hung

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:25.099
Caption: up on that

00:16:25.739 --> 00:16:29.940
Caption: so

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:31.679
Caption: one of the the attributes I&#39;ve seen of

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.078
Caption: microservices architecture that have

00:16:31.679 --> 00:16:35.760
Caption: been very successful is they&#39;ve evolved

00:16:34.078 --> 00:16:38.039
Caption: from something that worked

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:41.040
Caption: apparently SoundCloud example that had a

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:43.619
Caption: rails app had traffic they might have

00:16:41.039 --> 00:16:45.239
Caption: even been making money crazy

00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:47.219
Caption: um

00:16:45.239 --> 00:16:48.599
Caption: and

00:16:47.219 --> 00:16:50.819
Caption: you know they started with something and

00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:51.898
Caption: it was creaky and they sort of broke a

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.380
Caption: little about and started with something

00:16:51.898 --> 00:16:56.880
Caption: that worked and typically those things

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:59.398
Caption: work quite well because you here&#39;s a

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.958
Caption: problem let&#39;s take a chunk of it off the

00:16:59.398 --> 00:17:02.578
Caption: ones that start with a blank slate and

00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:04.739
Caption: go cool we&#39;re going to need 30 Services

00:17:02.578 --> 00:17:06.900
Caption: typically never ship

00:17:04.739 --> 00:17:07.918
Caption: again because if people have not worked

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.938
Caption: with this stuff before they don&#39;t

00:17:07.918 --> 00:17:10.198
Caption: actually know what challenges they&#39;re

00:17:08.938 --> 00:17:12.659
Caption: going to hit

00:17:10.198 --> 00:17:14.880
Caption: so yeah often good architecture will

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.500
Caption: evolve from good working software or

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.640
Caption: maybe it&#39;s not working well but you&#39;ve

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.400
Caption: got something that works you understand

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.140
Caption: it and you evolve from there so often

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.818
Caption: the the yeah most of the successful

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.280
Caption: stories I&#39;ve seen have started from

00:17:23.818 --> 00:17:28.140
Caption: something that was already there

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:30.059
Caption: particularly with Legacy systems I&#39;ve

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.500
Caption: seen a lot of

00:17:30.058 --> 00:17:33.798
Caption: who&#39;s worked on a failed Legacy system

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.798
Caption: replacement

00:17:34.038 --> 00:17:40.558
Caption: yeah right and generally they were like

00:17:37.619 --> 00:17:42.298
Caption: here&#39;s this thing it&#39;s old it&#39;s clunky

00:17:40.558 --> 00:17:43.380
Caption: we don&#39;t like it it&#39;s buggy it&#39;s hard to

00:17:42.298 --> 00:17:44.159
Caption: maintain you&#39;re like cool what we&#39;re

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.140
Caption: going to do is we&#39;re going to start

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.299
Caption: again over here and this time we&#39;re

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.859
Caption: going to do it right

00:17:48.298 --> 00:17:51.839
Caption: yeah

00:17:49.859 --> 00:17:54.479
Caption: and you never get there right like you

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:56.579
Caption: never you never ship it so

00:17:54.479 --> 00:17:57.900
Caption: whenever a new requirement comes in a

00:17:56.579 --> 00:18:00.058
Caption: new requirements always come in they&#39;re

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.099
Caption: like well that&#39;s not ready it doesn&#39;t do

00:18:00.058 --> 00:18:03.239
Caption: X Y and Z so we&#39;ll put it over here and

00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:05.160
Caption: all of a sudden you&#39;re chasing the

00:18:03.239 --> 00:18:06.900
Caption: target you&#39;ll never actually hit yes

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.140
Caption: Familia

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:11.760
Caption: yep um Legacy system Replacements that

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.260
Caption: work really well is you&#39;ve got an

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.119
Caption: architecture that lets you sort of move

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.140
Caption: something across at a time and make them

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:17.459
Caption: talk and go we&#39;ve got this new

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.979
Caption: requirement we&#39;ll put it over here and

00:18:17.459 --> 00:18:22.439
Caption: we&#39;ll integrate it because software is

00:18:19.979 --> 00:18:25.439
Caption: never done you know software is done

00:18:22.439 --> 00:18:27.058
Caption: like a lawn is mode you can mow the lawn

00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:29.699
Caption: you know the next day you&#39;re gonna need

00:18:27.058 --> 00:18:31.619
Caption: to mow it again or the next week so the

00:18:29.699 --> 00:18:33.599
Caption: idea that we&#39;re going to just replace a

00:18:31.619 --> 00:18:35.280
Caption: system turn it on turn the old one off

00:18:33.599 --> 00:18:38.239
Caption: and we&#39;re done you know it&#39;s just not

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.239
Caption: not a realistic one

00:18:38.939 --> 00:18:42.959
Caption: so now I get to the click bait

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:45.058
Caption: other than all of that stuff

00:18:42.959 --> 00:18:48.479
Caption: the one thing that you need to know for

00:18:45.058 --> 00:18:50.520
Caption: successful microservices architecture

00:18:48.479 --> 00:18:53.339
Caption: is software modeling

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.440
Caption: which you know gets thrown away modeling

00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:56.880
Caption: is hard like software modeling is hard

00:18:55.439 --> 00:18:58.798
Caption: this is why we have jobs because

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.839
Caption: modeling good software is a tricky thing

00:18:58.798 --> 00:19:02.579
Caption: to do and it&#39;s hard to do in one

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:05.159
Caption: solution you know if you like file a new

00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:06.538
Caption: project in your IDE of choice

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.679
Caption: and you go right we need to solve this

00:19:06.538 --> 00:19:10.019
Caption: problem

00:19:07.678 --> 00:19:11.399
Caption: um it&#39;s hard right like coming up with

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:14.280
Caption: the design and the modeling is a tricky

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:16.380
Caption: thing to do and it&#39;s hard in one project

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.140
Caption: if you start with 20 and you need to

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.819
Caption: refactor something you know all of a

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:22.320
Caption: sudden you&#39;ve just you know multiplied

00:19:20.819 --> 00:19:26.699
Caption: this problem

00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:30.599
Caption: and so what people typically do is

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:32.519
Caption: spin out all their services 20 of them

00:19:30.599 --> 00:19:34.500
Caption: um and then realize that they&#39;ve not got

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.940
Caption: the modeling right and then you sort of

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.380
Caption: start routing around everything and

00:19:35.939 --> 00:19:40.199
Caption: everything talks to everything else and

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:42.660
Caption: you know we&#39;re back to that kind of bad

00:19:40.199 --> 00:19:44.159
Caption: sewer thing and then people bring in

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.239
Caption: more infrastructure to solve our

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.799
Caption: services are talking too much let&#39;s

00:19:45.239 --> 00:19:48.959
Caption: bring in a service match or poly or

00:19:46.798 --> 00:19:50.159
Caption: something like that

00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:51.979
Caption: um

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.539
Caption: so yeah modeling

00:19:51.979 --> 00:19:56.160
Caption: so a couple of common really like common

00:19:54.538 --> 00:19:57.899
Caption: sort of code smells or architecture

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.340
Caption: smells that I see

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.200
Caption: um

00:19:59.339 --> 00:20:03.058
Caption: my favorite one is when you&#39;ve got a

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:06.298
Caption: service for an infrastructure function

00:20:03.058 --> 00:20:08.640
Caption: who has worked on a data service or a

00:20:06.298 --> 00:20:09.479
Caption: data manager no good

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.640
Caption: um

00:20:09.479 --> 00:20:13.380
Caption: so you know if you&#39;ve got a service that

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.820
Caption: are based around sort of infrastructure

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.839
Caption: things you&#39;re probably going to be

00:20:14.819 --> 00:20:17.839
Caption: having a bit of a bad time

00:20:18.239 --> 00:20:21.959
Caption: um but the other main one that goes

00:20:19.859 --> 00:20:24.239
Caption: wrong is what gets called The Entity

00:20:21.959 --> 00:20:25.918
Caption: service anti-pattern or a service per

00:20:24.239 --> 00:20:27.479
Caption: aggregate route

00:20:25.918 --> 00:20:29.038
Caption: do those names just go over everyone&#39;s

00:20:27.479 --> 00:20:31.380
Caption: head around me

00:20:29.038 --> 00:20:34.759
Caption: who&#39;s read this book

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.760
Caption: who&#39;s actually read it

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:41.819
Caption: who got to the end

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.979
Caption: yeah it is it&#39;s a it&#39;s an amazing book

00:20:41.819 --> 00:20:46.279
Caption: it&#39;s one of the driest books you&#39;ll ever

00:20:43.979 --> 00:20:46.280
Caption: read

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.260
Caption: um

00:20:47.339 --> 00:20:51.959
Caption: and and one of the things about this

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.820
Caption: book is actually who does domain driven

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:55.319
Caption: design

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:56.519
Caption: a few people you&#39;re hesitant you like

00:20:55.319 --> 00:20:59.819
Caption: and I&#39;m gonna get called out in a second

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.320
Caption: so you&#39;ve got some repositories

00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:02.519
Caption: some services

00:21:01.319 --> 00:21:04.859
Caption: yeah

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.419
Caption: do you have an on-site business Expert

00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:08.699
Caption: that you talk to and develop a custom

00:21:06.418 --> 00:21:10.199
Caption: vocabulary vocab you yeah okay cool

00:21:08.699 --> 00:21:11.779
Caption: excellent

00:21:10.199 --> 00:21:14.279
Caption: um you&#39;re the first one

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.780
Caption: so domain driven design is actually a

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.280
Caption: book around software modeling but nobody

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.780
Caption: gets to that bit because it&#39;s a chapter

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.820
Caption: 15.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.979
Caption: people get through the first few

00:21:20.819 --> 00:21:25.558
Caption: chapters around services and repository

00:21:22.979 --> 00:21:27.178
Caption: pattern and blah blah blah blah and

00:21:25.558 --> 00:21:29.158
Caption: naming your functions really long things

00:21:27.178 --> 00:21:31.798
Caption: and then never get to the final chapters

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:33.659
Caption: and Eric Evans actually I saw him give a

00:21:31.798 --> 00:21:35.038
Caption: talk about

00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:36.960
Caption: um about this book and he went if I had

00:21:35.038 --> 00:21:38.579
Caption: my time again I would just like change

00:21:36.959 --> 00:21:42.918
Caption: the order of the chapters because nobody

00:21:38.579 --> 00:21:42.918
Caption: actually gets to the to the meaty bit

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:48.839
Caption: so

00:21:46.678 --> 00:21:50.939
Caption: you know if you&#39;re modeling software

00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:52.319
Caption: you might have a customer an order in a

00:21:50.939 --> 00:21:53.339
Caption: shopping cart and catalog and pricing

00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:56.158
Caption: things like that when you&#39;re doing your

00:21:53.339 --> 00:21:58.260
Caption: modeling and

00:21:56.159 --> 00:22:00.000
Caption: that&#39;s called an entity or an aggregate

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.339
Caption: route in in domain driven design right

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.538
Caption: so often what we see is services that

00:22:02.339 --> 00:22:04.558
Caption: look like this and you can go and look

00:22:03.538 --> 00:22:06.658
Caption: like Microsoft best practice

00:22:04.558 --> 00:22:08.339
Caption: microservices you get something that

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:09.539
Caption: looks a lot like this and all of a

00:22:08.339 --> 00:22:13.140
Caption: sudden we&#39;ve got a service for every

00:22:09.538 --> 00:22:15.538
Caption: entity in our in our model yeah does

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:20.700
Caption: anyone remember JaVale Lowe

00:22:15.538 --> 00:22:22.079
Caption: early no cool early so uh said and I

00:22:20.699 --> 00:22:24.359
Caption: never thought this was a very outlandish

00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:26.760
Caption: thing to say but JaVale Lowry said that

00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:28.500
Caption: that in a good service oriented

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.339
Caption: architecture every class would be a

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.959
Caption: service

00:22:29.339 --> 00:22:32.699
Caption: and everyone laughed this was a

00:22:30.959 --> 00:22:34.140
Caption: ridiculous thing to say but we&#39;ve kind

00:22:32.699 --> 00:22:36.658
Caption: of ended up here

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.739
Caption: again this is my grumpy old man showing

00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:40.620
Caption: um

00:22:37.739 --> 00:22:42.658
Caption: so what happens is you know software

00:22:40.619 --> 00:22:44.640
Caption: there&#39;s a couple of

00:22:42.659 --> 00:22:46.320
Caption: principles of good software design

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.200
Caption: around

00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:50.699
Caption: um like loose coupling and and cohesion

00:22:49.199 --> 00:22:53.219
Caption: and

00:22:50.699 --> 00:22:56.158
Caption: as a software to collaborate within its

00:22:53.219 --> 00:22:58.739
Caption: design needs you know cohesion and if

00:22:56.159 --> 00:23:01.320
Caption: we&#39;ve split it too far apart then all of

00:22:58.739 --> 00:23:03.538
Caption: a sudden you know

00:23:01.319 --> 00:23:06.058
Caption: we&#39;re talking too much over you know

00:23:03.538 --> 00:23:09.058
Caption: http

00:23:06.058 --> 00:23:10.859
Caption: and you know then you have to deal with

00:23:09.058 --> 00:23:13.380
Caption: distributed computing

00:23:10.859 --> 00:23:15.239
Caption: a lot you know because software you know

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.739
Caption: is cohesive all these things talk to

00:23:15.239 --> 00:23:18.000
Caption: each other and if all of a sudden you&#39;re

00:23:16.739 --> 00:23:19.739
Caption: talking to each other over a network

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.599
Caption: boundary then you know again you&#39;ve got

00:23:19.739 --> 00:23:24.298
Caption: all sorts of problems

00:23:21.599 --> 00:23:26.158
Caption: and so what I see is service is just are

00:23:24.298 --> 00:23:27.298
Caption: way too chatty has anyone kind of worked

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:28.980
Caption: on a microservices architecture it&#39;s

00:23:27.298 --> 00:23:30.479
Caption: just way too chatty

00:23:28.979 --> 00:23:34.020
Caption: so then you bring in more infrastructure

00:23:30.479 --> 00:23:36.959
Caption: you bring in you know istio and

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.820
Caption: um sidecar services and service meshes

00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:40.319
Caption: and and things like that to solve the

00:23:38.819 --> 00:23:42.119
Caption: fact that we&#39;ve just split our design

00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:43.558
Caption: way too early and our boundaries are

00:23:42.119 --> 00:23:46.640
Caption: done um

00:23:43.558 --> 00:23:46.640
Caption: way way too early

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:53.640
Caption: so some of the symptoms of that

00:23:50.099 --> 00:23:55.859
Caption: when you see it is

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.079
Caption: um massive amounts of shared code

00:23:55.859 --> 00:24:00.538
Caption: so then we go okay all of our services

00:23:58.079 --> 00:24:03.239
Caption: need the same classes in there so okay

00:24:00.538 --> 00:24:05.939
Caption: we need a mono repo or or Worse still we

00:24:03.239 --> 00:24:07.439
Caption: have everything in one giant solution

00:24:05.939 --> 00:24:09.678
Caption: and I&#39;ve seen that like 20 micro

00:24:07.439 --> 00:24:14.000
Caption: services in one Visual Studio solution

00:24:09.678 --> 00:24:16.079
Caption: because they need so much shared code

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.819
Caption: and then you have back to the problem

00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:19.500
Caption: that we had in you know the early 2000s

00:24:17.819 --> 00:24:21.359
Caption: which is you need to deploy everything

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.459
Caption: exactly the same order

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:25.380
Caption: because you&#39;ve got four services with

00:24:23.459 --> 00:24:26.699
Caption: the same classes and if those classes

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.678
Caption: don&#39;t match

00:24:26.699 --> 00:24:30.418
Caption: you got all sorts of Errors so then you

00:24:28.678 --> 00:24:31.859
Caption: know everything has to be deployed at

00:24:30.418 --> 00:24:33.658
Caption: exactly the same time so they&#39;re not

00:24:31.859 --> 00:24:35.819
Caption: autonomous anymore

00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:37.440
Caption: um when I was at octopus deploy one of

00:24:35.819 --> 00:24:38.519
Caption: the things that we did at octopus and

00:24:37.439 --> 00:24:40.399
Caption: they still do is pretty much everyone

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:43.440
Caption: does a rotation on customer support

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:45.059
Caption: which is if you&#39;ve never done it it&#39;s an

00:24:43.439 --> 00:24:45.979
Caption: amazing way to develop empathy for your

00:24:45.058 --> 00:24:48.479
Caption: customer

00:24:45.979 --> 00:24:50.760
Caption: and you can make design decisions and

00:24:48.479 --> 00:24:52.140
Caption: then see the impact of that by figuring

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.940
Caption: out what&#39;s hard for people to do and

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.739
Caption: where they get it wrong it&#39;s amazingly

00:24:53.939 --> 00:24:57.899
Caption: an amazing process for kind of building

00:24:55.739 --> 00:25:00.178
Caption: empathy when you&#39;re within your team

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.159
Caption: the people would would write in or email

00:25:00.178 --> 00:25:04.619
Caption: in right in

00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:07.020
Caption: and they&#39;d say octopus doesn&#39;t support

00:25:04.619 --> 00:25:08.939
Caption: microservices I mean like what what do

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:11.400
Caption: you mean it&#39;s like we have all of our

00:25:08.939 --> 00:25:13.259
Caption: services each one&#39;s its own project but

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:16.339
Caption: we need all the projects to be deployed

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.339
Caption: at exactly the same time

00:25:17.819 --> 00:25:21.178
Caption: so what this gets snarkly cold is you

00:25:19.678 --> 00:25:23.279
Caption: don&#39;t have microservices you have a

00:25:21.178 --> 00:25:24.979
Caption: distributed monolith which is kind of

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:28.260
Caption: the worst of

00:25:24.979 --> 00:25:30.058
Caption: the worst of all of those worlds

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.279
Caption: um and then again when you start adding

00:25:30.058 --> 00:25:33.899
Caption: infrastructure to it

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:35.400
Caption: so

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.719
Caption: for those of you who got through 15

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.400
Caption: chapters of the domain-driven design

00:25:36.719 --> 00:25:39.839
Caption: book

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.520
Caption: there&#39;s a concept called a bounded

00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:42.839
Caption: context

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.179
Caption: and

00:25:42.839 --> 00:25:47.158
Caption: again this is a book about modeling and

00:25:45.178 --> 00:25:48.298
Caption: and you start speaking to experts within

00:25:47.159 --> 00:25:51.179
Caption: the business

00:25:48.298 --> 00:25:53.219
Caption: and you develop a shared vocabulary and

00:25:51.178 --> 00:25:54.959
Caption: in chapter 15 of the domain driven

00:25:53.219 --> 00:25:57.119
Caption: design book

00:25:54.959 --> 00:25:59.699
Caption: Eric Evan says that if you start to

00:25:57.119 --> 00:26:01.739
Caption: notice that different groups of people

00:25:59.699 --> 00:26:03.538
Caption: in the business start using words

00:26:01.739 --> 00:26:06.418
Caption: differently or talking about something

00:26:03.538 --> 00:26:08.579
Caption: with a different phrase that&#39;s a bounded

00:26:06.418 --> 00:26:10.859
Caption: context yeah

00:26:08.579 --> 00:26:12.899
Caption: um and you find that you know if anyone

00:26:10.859 --> 00:26:14.339
Caption: sort of worked in a big organization you

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.500
Caption: might say well this thing is an order

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:18.178
Caption: but an order to somebody else is a

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:21.538
Caption: completely different concept someone

00:26:18.178 --> 00:26:24.538
Caption: felt felt that one yep

00:26:21.538 --> 00:26:26.699
Caption: so the best example of this I&#39;ve heard

00:26:24.538 --> 00:26:28.439
Caption: um was from a guy named Dan North who

00:26:26.699 --> 00:26:31.380
Caption: was also thoughtworks and and he had a

00:26:28.439 --> 00:26:34.579
Caption: taught a bunch of years ago

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:38.219
Caption: that I&#39;m going to steal shamelessly

00:26:34.579 --> 00:26:40.918
Caption: where he talked about going on holiday

00:26:38.219 --> 00:26:42.418
Caption: and he has this this concept of okay I&#39;m

00:26:40.918 --> 00:26:43.859
Caption: going on holiday

00:26:42.418 --> 00:26:47.038
Caption: um

00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:50.640
Caption: and your view of your holiday might be a

00:26:47.038 --> 00:26:52.979
Caption: a postcard or or a you know a website or

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.979
Caption: a magazine article where you&#39;ve got

00:26:52.979 --> 00:26:58.439
Caption: Beach you know white sandy beach

00:26:55.979 --> 00:27:00.538
Caption: cocktail umbrella you know snorkeling

00:26:58.439 --> 00:27:02.219
Caption: whatever it is that&#39;s your I&#39;m going on

00:27:00.538 --> 00:27:03.658
Caption: holiday I&#39;m really stressed I need to go

00:27:02.219 --> 00:27:05.099
Caption: and sit on the beach okay that&#39;s your

00:27:03.659 --> 00:27:06.659
Caption: view of a holiday

00:27:05.099 --> 00:27:07.678
Caption: um but to get there you need to do a few

00:27:06.659 --> 00:27:11.760
Caption: things you need to put in a leave

00:27:07.678 --> 00:27:13.140
Caption: request okay it&#39;s in your HR department

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.058
Caption: um needs to think about your holiday now

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.739
Caption: your HR department&#39;s view of your

00:27:15.058 --> 00:27:18.599
Caption: holiday is not like sandy beaches in a

00:27:16.739 --> 00:27:21.538
Caption: cocktail with an umbrella in it

00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:24.058
Caption: um your hr&#39;s view of your holiday is do

00:27:21.538 --> 00:27:25.619
Caption: you have enough leave days

00:27:24.058 --> 00:27:27.359
Caption: kind of thing how many hours have you

00:27:25.619 --> 00:27:29.520
Caption: accrued you might also have to get that

00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:31.619
Caption: signed up by your manager

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.479
Caption: your manager&#39;s view of your holiday

00:27:31.619 --> 00:27:34.918
Caption: might be well actually we have this

00:27:33.479 --> 00:27:36.359
Caption: project deadline we&#39;ve got our Legacy

00:27:34.918 --> 00:27:38.699
Caption: system replacement it&#39;s due to go live

00:27:36.359 --> 00:27:39.959
Caption: next month no you can&#39;t go on holiday

00:27:38.699 --> 00:27:41.099
Caption: um which is exactly why you need to go

00:27:39.959 --> 00:27:41.699
Caption: on holiday

00:27:41.099 --> 00:27:43.798
Caption: um

00:27:41.699 --> 00:27:46.380
Caption: you might call a travel agent to you

00:27:43.798 --> 00:27:47.459
Caption: know book you a flight and a hotel so

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.839
Caption: they&#39;re going to have a completely

00:27:47.459 --> 00:27:50.699
Caption: different set of words and different

00:27:48.839 --> 00:27:53.099
Caption: lens and different framing of your

00:27:50.699 --> 00:27:55.859
Caption: holiday it&#39;s all the same thing

00:27:53.099 --> 00:27:57.900
Caption: but everybody has a completely different

00:27:55.859 --> 00:28:00.119
Caption: set of terminology and way of thinking

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.820
Caption: about and framing your holiday and and

00:28:00.119 --> 00:28:05.298
Caption: that&#39;s about a context yeah

00:28:02.819 --> 00:28:05.298
Caption: so

00:28:06.779 --> 00:28:11.520
Caption: it&#39;s a bounded context around the people

00:28:09.058 --> 00:28:14.418
Caption: involved in something and and the

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.419
Caption: interactions with it

00:28:15.659 --> 00:28:20.340
Caption: Okay so

00:28:17.699 --> 00:28:22.678
Caption: if you think about Building Services you

00:28:20.339 --> 00:28:25.140
Caption: can start to use that framing around

00:28:22.678 --> 00:28:26.760
Caption: what a service is so if you&#39;ve got a

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:29.400
Caption: bounded context you know well we look at

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.839
Caption: this thing and it means this to us that

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.299
Caption: might be a really good place to start

00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:35.819
Caption: with a service yeah

00:28:33.298 --> 00:28:37.739
Caption: and then what you can do is model the

00:28:35.819 --> 00:28:39.719
Caption: communication across the people in this

00:28:37.739 --> 00:28:42.239
Caption: organization and

00:28:39.719 --> 00:28:44.158
Caption: how they communicate that stuff and that

00:28:42.239 --> 00:28:45.599
Caption: becomes then a really good shape of of

00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:46.980
Caption: what your service looks like and what

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:49.558
Caption: that sort of bounded context looks like

00:28:46.979 --> 00:28:51.359
Caption: so you know

00:28:49.558 --> 00:28:54.058
Caption: um

00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:55.380
Caption: if somebody says in your organization go

00:28:54.058 --> 00:28:57.839
Caption: do this

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.339
Caption: that&#39;s a that&#39;s called a command or if

00:28:57.839 --> 00:29:00.778
Caption: somebody else sits there and they wait

00:28:59.339 --> 00:29:02.640
Caption: for it wait to be told about something

00:29:00.779 --> 00:29:04.500
Caption: that&#39;s an event and we can start to

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.760
Caption: model then commands and events and

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.760
Caption: requests within an organization

00:29:08.459 --> 00:29:11.880
Caption: so

00:29:10.079 --> 00:29:13.439
Caption: to put an example on that

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.659
Caption: think about

00:29:13.439 --> 00:29:17.278
Caption: a really bad restaurant

00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:18.960
Caption: okay you imagine turning up to a

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:20.880
Caption: restaurant and you sit down with your

00:29:18.959 --> 00:29:23.520
Caption: friends and

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.959
Caption: a waiter comes up with a menu board with

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.539
Caption: no prices on it

00:29:24.959 --> 00:29:29.699
Caption: let&#39;s go here are the things

00:29:27.538 --> 00:29:30.658
Caption: and you&#39;d say

00:29:29.699 --> 00:29:32.639
Caption: um

00:29:30.659 --> 00:29:34.679
Caption: how much is the burger and they just run

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.119
Caption: away and come back and go that&#39;s you

00:29:34.678 --> 00:29:37.500
Caption: know 12.

00:29:36.119 --> 00:29:39.298
Caption: and you go

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.500
Caption: I&#39;ll have a burger thanks and they go

00:29:39.298 --> 00:29:42.898
Caption: okay

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.339
Caption: I&#39;ll just check if we have them and they

00:29:42.899 --> 00:29:45.840
Caption: run back into the kitchen come back and

00:29:44.339 --> 00:29:48.000
Caption: go yes you can have a Bergen like cool

00:29:45.839 --> 00:29:49.918
Caption: well I&#39;d like the burger thanks

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.558
Caption: um and we&#39;d also like the fish and like

00:29:49.918 --> 00:29:53.699
Caption: hang on and they run back into the

00:29:52.558 --> 00:29:56.579
Caption: kitchen a few minutes later come back

00:29:53.699 --> 00:29:59.519
Caption: okay no we don&#39;t have fish

00:29:56.579 --> 00:30:01.619
Caption: and so you&#39;re frustrating well can we

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.940
Caption: have some pizza now run back in and they

00:30:01.619 --> 00:30:04.500
Caption: go through this process of like running

00:30:02.939 --> 00:30:06.119
Caption: back in and checking if they have it for

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:09.439
Caption: all of the food and all of the drinks

00:30:06.119 --> 00:30:09.439
Caption: for every single person at the table

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:14.940
Caption: and then you go okay got the order right

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.140
Caption: I would like that and they go cool that

00:30:14.939 --> 00:30:17.819
Caption: will cost this

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.558
Caption: well we haven&#39;t eaten yet but you know

00:30:17.819 --> 00:30:20.939
Caption: okay here&#39;s the card and they walk and

00:30:19.558 --> 00:30:22.918
Caption: they stand in line behind all the other

00:30:20.939 --> 00:30:24.778
Caption: staff in one line to get to the one f

00:30:22.918 --> 00:30:28.319
Caption: plus machine payment gateways are hard

00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:31.200
Caption: and eventually they get there

00:30:28.319 --> 00:30:32.699
Caption: process your card and it&#39;s declined so

00:30:31.199 --> 00:30:34.199
Caption: they come back and go that card was

00:30:32.699 --> 00:30:35.398
Caption: declined Ah that&#39;s right I&#39;m gonna put

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:37.260
Caption: money on that account so you transfer

00:30:35.399 --> 00:30:39.179
Caption: some money over and they go and get back

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.558
Caption: in the line

00:30:39.178 --> 00:30:42.239
Caption: and you&#39;re sitting there at this point

00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:43.380
Caption: you&#39;re hungry you&#39;re grumpy

00:30:42.239 --> 00:30:44.640
Caption: um because this order still hasn&#39;t gone

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.558
Caption: to the kitchen because you haven&#39;t paid

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.299
Caption: for it yet they come back and go yes

00:30:46.558 --> 00:30:50.278
Caption: that was successful and then they go

00:30:48.298 --> 00:30:51.839
Caption: into the kitchen to place your order and

00:30:50.279 --> 00:30:52.619
Caption: they just disappear you don&#39;t see them

00:30:51.839 --> 00:30:54.239
Caption: again

00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:56.579
Caption: for a long time

00:30:54.239 --> 00:30:58.500
Caption: and you realize that all the weight

00:30:56.579 --> 00:31:00.178
Caption: staff are walking into the kitchen

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.500
Caption: and not coming out until they have the

00:31:00.178 --> 00:31:04.798
Caption: food

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:05.760
Caption: yeah So eventually your waiter comes out

00:31:04.798 --> 00:31:07.739
Caption: um

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.599
Caption: gives you food and you and you eat the

00:31:07.739 --> 00:31:11.399
Caption: field but eat the meal at that point you

00:31:09.599 --> 00:31:13.558
Caption: know you&#39;re having a bad time it&#39;s not

00:31:11.399 --> 00:31:16.380
Caption: it&#39;s not a great dining experience one

00:31:13.558 --> 00:31:17.699
Caption: star would not do again

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.959
Caption: um and this company is not going to last

00:31:17.699 --> 00:31:20.939
Caption: too long because they&#39;re going to need

00:31:18.959 --> 00:31:21.898
Caption: way too many staff they&#39;re going to go

00:31:20.939 --> 00:31:23.219
Caption: through the stuff because everyone&#39;s

00:31:21.899 --> 00:31:25.140
Caption: rude to them

00:31:23.219 --> 00:31:27.658
Caption: um and it just it&#39;s not going to scale

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.678
Caption: right

00:31:27.659 --> 00:31:30.720
Caption: has anyone been to this restaurant

00:31:28.678 --> 00:31:32.880
Caption: sounds pretty bad

00:31:30.719 --> 00:31:35.398
Caption: this is how we build systems this is how

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:37.459
Caption: a lot of people build software

00:31:35.399 --> 00:31:37.460
Caption: um

00:31:38.038 --> 00:31:40.798
Caption: because you know coming back to this

00:31:39.538 --> 00:31:42.418
Caption: kind of

00:31:40.798 --> 00:31:44.459
Caption: sort of canonical microservice

00:31:42.418 --> 00:31:45.298
Caption: architecture that you see it looks like

00:31:44.459 --> 00:31:47.579
Caption: this

00:31:45.298 --> 00:31:49.739
Caption: and we&#39;ve got all of these HTTP requests

00:31:47.579 --> 00:31:52.558
Caption: now what&#39;s something about HTTP requests

00:31:49.739 --> 00:31:53.939
Caption: the synchronous okay and so we build

00:31:52.558 --> 00:31:55.439
Caption: this stuff and this is kind of how we

00:31:53.939 --> 00:31:56.939
Caption: build this restaurant like I would like

00:31:55.439 --> 00:31:58.319
Caption: to do this I will go check the pricing

00:31:56.939 --> 00:32:00.239
Caption: service like literally every micro

00:31:58.319 --> 00:32:02.339
Caption: service kind of beginning article has a

00:32:00.239 --> 00:32:03.658
Caption: cart service and a pricing service

00:32:02.339 --> 00:32:05.099
Caption: um and that&#39;s like the way to holding

00:32:03.659 --> 00:32:07.140
Caption: the board and then going have to ask the

00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:08.579
Caption: manager how much the burger is

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.260
Caption: um

00:32:08.579 --> 00:32:11.459
Caption: and it&#39;s bad this is how we build

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.479
Caption: systems

00:32:11.459 --> 00:32:15.739
Caption: so

00:32:12.479 --> 00:32:15.739
Caption: let&#39;s think about a better restaurant

00:32:15.959 --> 00:32:19.859
Caption: you walk in you sit down the staff hands

00:32:18.479 --> 00:32:21.359
Caption: you out some menus the menus have prices

00:32:19.859 --> 00:32:23.339
Caption: on the menus have specials on them

00:32:21.359 --> 00:32:25.500
Caption: because somebody sat down when those

00:32:23.339 --> 00:32:26.939
Caption: prices change created a menu and put it

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.678
Caption: on there you sit down and they go

00:32:26.939 --> 00:32:30.058
Caption: actually look I just the kitchen just

00:32:28.678 --> 00:32:31.380
Caption: told me we&#39;ve just run out of fish so

00:32:30.058 --> 00:32:32.520
Caption: that one&#39;s not in there you know okay

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.199
Caption: cool that&#39;s fine I&#39;ll order something

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.058
Caption: else

00:32:34.199 --> 00:32:38.579
Caption: you sit there and you go here&#39;s the

00:32:36.058 --> 00:32:39.839
Caption: order and the staff you know write the

00:32:38.579 --> 00:32:43.019
Caption: food on one slip and the drinks on

00:32:39.839 --> 00:32:45.058
Caption: another slip and they you know take one

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:48.719
Caption: slip to the kitchen another one to the

00:32:45.058 --> 00:32:50.819
Caption: bar and your orders in all easy

00:32:48.719 --> 00:32:51.959
Caption: and then after a few minutes

00:32:50.819 --> 00:32:53.699
Caption: um

00:32:51.959 --> 00:32:56.099
Caption: bell rings at the kitchen

00:32:53.699 --> 00:32:57.599
Caption: okay and some staff go over to see what

00:32:56.099 --> 00:32:59.520
Caption: the Bell was for it&#39;s like okay table

00:32:57.599 --> 00:33:01.500
Caption: ten food&#39;s ready and they bring

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.940
Caption: to your table and you sit down and eat

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.599
Caption: it

00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:05.599
Caption: and

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.079
Caption: when it&#39;s time to go you go up and you

00:33:07.918 --> 00:33:11.339
Caption: pay like to pay for table 10. again you

00:33:10.079 --> 00:33:12.898
Caption: might still have the f plus problem but

00:33:11.339 --> 00:33:14.278
Caption: it&#39;s easy you know just just kind of

00:33:12.899 --> 00:33:16.140
Caption: solve it

00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:17.340
Caption: and meanwhile you&#39;ve got a restaurant

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.019
Caption: manager who&#39;s sitting there kind of

00:33:17.339 --> 00:33:20.699
Caption: overseeing like this table got their

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:22.980
Caption: food on time is anyone waiting too long

00:33:20.699 --> 00:33:24.658
Caption: is everything kind of working as it is

00:33:22.979 --> 00:33:26.339
Caption: right

00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:28.500
Caption: that&#39;s a better restaurant because

00:33:26.339 --> 00:33:29.339
Caption: you&#39;ve got

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.260
Caption: um

00:33:29.339 --> 00:33:32.398
Caption: it&#39;s for your staff and they&#39;re getting

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:35.880
Caption: more done

00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:38.039
Caption: because they&#39;re not relying on waiting

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:40.199
Caption: for answers all the time they take your

00:33:38.038 --> 00:33:42.058
Caption: order into the kitchen they say make

00:33:40.199 --> 00:33:43.859
Caption: this yep

00:33:42.058 --> 00:33:46.380
Caption: and when it&#39;s ready someone rings a bell

00:33:43.859 --> 00:33:47.939
Caption: and they come and get it

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:51.019
Caption: one&#39;s a command

00:33:47.939 --> 00:33:53.099
Caption: another one&#39;s an event yeah

00:33:51.019 --> 00:33:55.080
Caption: and so

00:33:53.099 --> 00:33:56.398
Caption: the way these like it&#39;s the same

00:33:55.079 --> 00:33:57.538
Caption: activities they&#39;re still ordering food

00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:58.919
Caption: and they&#39;re still cooking food and the

00:33:57.538 --> 00:34:01.798
Caption: silvering is still paying but it&#39;s the

00:33:58.918 --> 00:34:03.538
Caption: way those activities are are grouped and

00:34:01.798 --> 00:34:05.639
Caption: who&#39;s in charge of it and how the

00:34:03.538 --> 00:34:08.098
Caption: communication happens is better modeling

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:10.800
Caption: yeah does anyone go and watch businesses

00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:12.300
Caption: and just like think about the systems

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.099
Caption: you know like massively into systems

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.479
Caption: thinking and you look at that and go if

00:34:14.099 --> 00:34:17.580
Caption: that person did that job everything

00:34:15.479 --> 00:34:18.959
Caption: would go better yeah it&#39;s great great

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.820
Caption: people watching

00:34:18.959 --> 00:34:23.280
Caption: I can&#39;t help myself

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:25.320
Caption: um and and it&#39;s modeling right

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.178
Caption: um and so in this restaurant the staff

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.159
Caption: know when something&#39;s run out they&#39;ve

00:34:27.178 --> 00:34:30.959
Caption: got the prices of stuff the kitchen

00:34:29.158 --> 00:34:32.098
Caption: knows when to make something you don&#39;t

00:34:30.959 --> 00:34:33.898
Caption: have

00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:35.339
Caption: a waiter standing in this kitchen going

00:34:33.898 --> 00:34:36.479
Caption: is it ready yet is it ready yet is it

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:38.520
Caption: ready yet is it ready yet is it ready

00:34:36.479 --> 00:34:40.439
Caption: yet you know someone rings a bell okay

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.418
Caption: good modeling and this is a good

00:34:40.439 --> 00:34:46.219
Caption: restaurant you leave from this good

00:34:42.418 --> 00:34:46.219
Caption: experience five-star would eat again

00:34:47.459 --> 00:34:51.118
Caption: so

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:53.820
Caption: what can we take from this

00:34:51.118 --> 00:34:55.858
Caption: chains of requests do not scale well

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.420
Caption: yeah then I worked in a company where to

00:34:55.858 --> 00:34:59.399
Caption: get anything done you have to ask your

00:34:57.419 --> 00:35:01.260
Caption: manager and they ask their manager and

00:34:59.399 --> 00:35:02.279
Caption: then they asked kind of a sideways and

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.239
Caption: it goes down and you&#39;re sitting there

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.219
Caption: and you&#39;re like couldn&#39;t I have just

00:35:03.239 --> 00:35:06.780
Caption: gone and talked to them

00:35:05.219 --> 00:35:08.879
Caption: it doesn&#39;t scale

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:11.099
Caption: um it&#39;s not a fun place to work the

00:35:08.879 --> 00:35:13.078
Caption: chains of requests do not scale it&#39;s not

00:35:11.099 --> 00:35:14.520
Caption: a way to get things done

00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:18.359
Caption: people that have the information to do

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:20.520
Caption: their job are a lot more effective at it

00:35:18.358 --> 00:35:22.319
Caption: um again these are kind of Fairly

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.099
Caption: commonly known things

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.920
Caption: um

00:35:23.099 --> 00:35:27.960
Caption: but software boundaries that follow

00:35:25.919 --> 00:35:29.280
Caption: these same principles tend to work

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:31.679
Caption: better and a lot of it is around

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.359
Caption: synchronicity so you know synchronous

00:35:31.679 --> 00:35:35.578
Caption: things where you&#39;re waiting for an

00:35:33.358 --> 00:35:36.659
Caption: answer don&#39;t scale and don&#39;t kind of

00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:37.739
Caption: work as well as things that are

00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:38.879
Caption: asynchronous

00:35:37.739 --> 00:35:41.760
Caption: again

00:35:38.879 --> 00:35:42.779
Caption: ring the bell the food&#39;s ready

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.699
Caption: so

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.099
Caption: applying this to Services if a service

00:35:44.699 --> 00:35:48.719
Caption: knows enough to do its job

00:35:47.099 --> 00:35:51.359
Caption: then it&#39;s going to scale better it&#39;s

00:35:48.719 --> 00:35:52.260
Caption: going to work better so I have a I have

00:35:51.358 --> 00:35:54.239
Caption: a cute name for this which is

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.280
Caption: human-shaped microservices

00:35:54.239 --> 00:35:58.260
Caption: trademark

00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.000
Caption: [Laughter]

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:02.639
Caption: um so you know when I look at it when I

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.040
Caption: look at a a software system and kind of

00:36:02.639 --> 00:36:07.379
Caption: try to to bring it down to well if

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.300
Caption: people were doing it

00:36:07.379 --> 00:36:10.919
Caption: who would the people be what would they

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.479
Caption: be in charge of

00:36:10.919 --> 00:36:14.399
Caption: um how would they do that thing and how

00:36:12.479 --> 00:36:16.260
Caption: would they communicate it so what would

00:36:14.399 --> 00:36:17.939
Caption: people do if we were building this

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.380
Caption: system out of people

00:36:17.939 --> 00:36:21.540
Caption: and

00:36:19.379 --> 00:36:23.039
Caption: again synchronous chains of people

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.000
Caption: asking a question going what&#39;s the

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.679
Caption: answer what&#39;s the answer what&#39;s the

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.199
Caption: answer is not a good it&#39;s not you know

00:36:25.679 --> 00:36:29.399
Caption: an effective business to to be in so you

00:36:28.199 --> 00:36:31.979
Caption: look at well if you&#39;re going to group

00:36:29.399 --> 00:36:32.939
Caption: this and have people doing those jobs

00:36:31.979 --> 00:36:35.820
Caption: um

00:36:32.939 --> 00:36:37.500
Caption: how would you organize that company to

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:41.760
Caption: be effective

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:43.139
Caption: and then build the systems the same way

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.760
Caption: so a really good technique for this

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:46.919
Caption: something called event storming has

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:49.199
Caption: anyone seen events stormy what kind of a

00:36:46.919 --> 00:36:52.379
Caption: modeling technique where you get Post-it

00:36:49.199 --> 00:36:54.659
Caption: notes on a board and and you say well

00:36:52.379 --> 00:36:56.519
Caption: if we&#39;re doing this you know I would

00:36:54.659 --> 00:36:58.679
Caption: tell the kitchen to make these things

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.599
Caption: okay that&#39;s a command and then the

00:36:58.679 --> 00:37:02.159
Caption: kitchen would say this order is ready

00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:04.560
Caption: that&#39;s an event and you kind of with

00:37:02.159 --> 00:37:06.539
Caption: different colored sticky notes

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.800
Caption: stick them all on a board with these are

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:10.160
Caption: the commands and these are the events

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:13.619
Caption: and then figure out what talks to what

00:37:10.159 --> 00:37:15.780
Caption: and why and you end up with a really

00:37:13.618 --> 00:37:16.919
Caption: good mapping of the way an organization

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.159
Caption: should work

00:37:16.919 --> 00:37:21.838
Caption: and then build the software around that

00:37:20.159 --> 00:37:22.618
Caption: so again

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:24.119
Caption: um

00:37:22.618 --> 00:37:26.098
Caption: commands and events work really well

00:37:24.118 --> 00:37:27.779
Caption: here

00:37:26.099 --> 00:37:31.380
Caption: I&#39;m going to quickly talk about kind of

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:33.859
Caption: the tech of that because often like

00:37:31.379 --> 00:37:37.858
Caption: people sort of tend to think about

00:37:33.858 --> 00:37:39.239
Caption: microservices as you know just rest but

00:37:37.858 --> 00:37:40.319
Caption: I actually really like messaging for a

00:37:39.239 --> 00:37:42.719
Caption: lot of this stuff

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.959
Caption: because it Maps really quite well

00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:47.879
Caption: so HTTP is a synchronous

00:37:45.959 --> 00:37:49.260
Caption: transport you know that&#39;s about

00:37:47.879 --> 00:37:51.959
Caption: requesting a document and getting

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.939
Caption: something back and what we&#39;ve learned is

00:37:51.959 --> 00:37:55.618
Caption: synchronous calls will reduce your

00:37:53.939 --> 00:37:57.959
Caption: reliability

00:37:55.618 --> 00:37:59.578
Caption: um and they reduce your ability to scale

00:37:57.959 --> 00:38:00.598
Caption: and you have to deploy stuff at exactly

00:37:59.579 --> 00:38:03.180
Caption: the right time because it&#39;s not

00:38:00.599 --> 00:38:04.020
Caption: something there you know it gets hard

00:38:03.179 --> 00:38:07.020
Caption: um

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:09.000
Caption: so you can still use HTTP to model

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.500
Caption: commands and events if you want but it

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.820
Caption: ends up being a bunch more work you

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.260
Caption: might have a table of events and then

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.599
Caption: you know all the other services have to

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.579
Caption: kind of poll that table and keep a

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:19.079
Caption: cursor and it&#39;s extra database stuff so

00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:20.640
Caption: messaging kind of works really really

00:38:19.079 --> 00:38:22.640
Caption: well for this

00:38:20.639 --> 00:38:22.639
Caption: um

00:38:23.459 --> 00:38:26.459
Caption: um you know for this for this style of

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:29.159
Caption: thing because you can you can put a

00:38:26.459 --> 00:38:31.500
Caption: command on a queue

00:38:29.159 --> 00:38:32.639
Caption: sorry

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:35.280
Caption: um

00:38:32.639 --> 00:38:36.838
Caption: and yeah you can have Pub sub and and

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.320
Caption: messaging systems work really really

00:38:36.839 --> 00:38:40.320
Caption: well for microservices

00:38:40.739 --> 00:38:43.919
Caption: rest is still a great API service

00:38:42.358 --> 00:38:46.078
Caption: particularly on the web like the web is

00:38:43.919 --> 00:38:47.699
Caption: built around HTTP we&#39;ve got cdns we&#39;ve

00:38:46.079 --> 00:38:49.380
Caption: got proxies you know like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a

00:38:47.699 --> 00:38:51.060
Caption: really good protocol and there&#39;s lots of

00:38:49.379 --> 00:38:53.939
Caption: semantics built into it

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:56.040
Caption: um into HTTP and then you sort of apply

00:38:53.939 --> 00:38:57.719
Caption: a rest Style on top of that that&#39;s a

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.320
Caption: whole other discussion

00:38:57.719 --> 00:39:00.659
Caption: um

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.219
Caption: let me get a hypertext is a good thing

00:39:00.659 --> 00:39:05.358
Caption: like a lot of the web is built on that

00:39:02.219 --> 00:39:05.358
Caption: and the scales really really well

00:39:07.199 --> 00:39:10.979
Caption: so I have a pattern that I&#39;ve had a lot

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:13.679
Caption: of success with that again as a joke one

00:39:10.979 --> 00:39:14.760
Caption: day I call it mullet micro services

00:39:13.679 --> 00:39:17.659
Caption: um because it&#39;s got rest on the front

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.659
Caption: and messaging in the back

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.660
Caption: and people seem to like that so I&#39;m I&#39;m

00:39:19.858 --> 00:39:23.759
Caption: sticking with it but this is the part

00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:25.439
Caption: I&#39;ve had a lot of success with even in

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.959
Caption: sort of replacing Legacy systems where

00:39:25.439 --> 00:39:29.520
Caption: you can build Services behind a load

00:39:27.959 --> 00:39:31.379
Caption: balancer yeah

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.959
Caption: but their back plane the way they

00:39:31.379 --> 00:39:35.578
Caption: communicate to each other is through

00:39:33.959 --> 00:39:37.078
Caption: messages from a message broker or you

00:39:35.579 --> 00:39:39.239
Caption: know something like that

00:39:37.079 --> 00:39:40.560
Caption: and I&#39;m running out of time quickly some

00:39:39.239 --> 00:39:41.639
Caption: conclusions

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.920
Caption: um

00:39:41.639 --> 00:39:46.439
Caption: from all of this is learn from history

00:39:43.919 --> 00:39:48.179
Caption: like if you want to set out to to use a

00:39:46.439 --> 00:39:50.098
Caption: new technique or a new tool or a piece

00:39:48.179 --> 00:39:52.679
Caption: of infrastructure or a pattern or you

00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:55.619
Caption: know whatever it is understand that idea

00:39:52.679 --> 00:39:57.899
Caption: and what led to it like what problem

00:39:55.618 --> 00:40:00.419
Caption: was being solved when somebody created

00:39:57.899 --> 00:40:01.858
Caption: this thing what caused that problem that

00:40:00.419 --> 00:40:03.899
Caption: they were going to solve

00:40:01.858 --> 00:40:06.179
Caption: what caused that you know understand the

00:40:03.899 --> 00:40:07.020
Caption: history of of in context of how we got

00:40:06.179 --> 00:40:08.459
Caption: there

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:10.199
Caption: and doing that will just make you a

00:40:08.459 --> 00:40:11.399
Caption: better technologist like we&#39;re going to

00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:13.260
Caption: use this thing and it was designed to

00:40:11.399 --> 00:40:15.779
Caption: solve this problem we have that problem

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.919
Caption: it&#39;s a good fit if it&#39;s we want to do

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.780
Caption: that because it&#39;s on hacking news and

00:40:16.919 --> 00:40:21.799
Caption: it&#39;s really cool you&#39;re going to be a

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.800
Caption: less effective technologist

00:40:24.899 --> 00:40:29.279
Caption: um another takeaway is microservices and

00:40:27.419 --> 00:40:31.260
Caption: so I kind of have the same roots and the

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.000
Caption: same problems they&#39;re about if you go

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:35.820
Caption: back and read sort of the the early

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.579
Caption: stuff around so it&#39;s about services that

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:41.219
Caption: are Loosely coupled and autonomously

00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:42.780
Caption: manage a business process and

00:40:41.219 --> 00:40:44.098
Caption: microservices are kind of the same but a

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.659
Caption: bit smaller but essentially the

00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:46.560
Caption: principles are there

00:40:45.659 --> 00:40:49.020
Caption: um

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.219
Caption: and you know if we sort of don&#39;t like

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:54.380
Caption: autonomously manage that business

00:40:50.219 --> 00:40:54.379

Caption: processes how would people do that model

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.880
Caption: your software after that and then the

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:05.040
Caption: main one is never forget that actually

00:41:02.879 --> 00:41:06.959
Caption: delivering value is the goal

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.419

Caption: customers or solving the internal

00:41:17.099 --> 00:41:23.359
Caption: Problem whatever it is that&#39;s the goal

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.358
Caption: um and we get way too caught up in that

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.880
Caption: um

00:41:24.479 --> 00:41:28.379

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:41.579
Caption: times that I&#39;m like what can I do about

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:43.260
Caption: this so I actually want to teach it you

Caption: know teach this stuff and get Hands-On

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:47.040
Caption: but I don&#39;t want to make it too much of

00:41:44.699 --> 00:41:48.179
Caption: a plug with that we&#39;re getting low on

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.579

Caption: chat about this stuff but any questions

00:41:54.659 --> 00:41:57.199
Caption: in the room

00:41:59.339 --> 00:42:03.900
Caption: what

00:42:01.618 --> 00:42:06.059
Caption: thanks for that that was great mate

00:42:03.899 --> 00:42:07.919
Caption: um I work in a medium-sized organization

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:10.260
Caption: that was that&#39;s now integrating with a

00:42:07.919 --> 00:42:12.358
Caption: very large organization

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:14.639
Caption: um what are the kind of

00:42:12.358 --> 00:42:16.979
Caption: I guess cultural preconditions for

00:42:14.639 --> 00:42:18.419
Caption: microservices and especially in an

00:42:16.979 --> 00:42:22.260
Caption: organization that&#39;s already on the

00:42:18.419 --> 00:42:23.939
Caption: journey but but yeah yeah that&#39;s a

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:26.280
Caption: that&#39;s a tricky one and I like honestly

00:42:23.939 --> 00:42:27.118
Caption: I&#39;ve not seen a one-size-fits all to

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.159
Caption: that

00:42:27.118 --> 00:42:30.838
Caption: um the biggest problem seems to be in

00:42:29.159 --> 00:42:32.819
Caption: those those Journeys and those

00:42:30.839 --> 00:42:34.800
Caption: organizations is that

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:37.140
Caption: it&#39;s very hard to get anything started

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:39.239
Caption: because they&#39;re so risk adverse that no

00:42:37.139 --> 00:42:40.739
Caption: one ever wants to fail so it&#39;s you know

00:42:39.239 --> 00:42:42.000
Caption: and I&#39;ve I&#39;ve seen this in a big

00:42:40.739 --> 00:42:44.040
Caption: organization where it&#39;s like we want to

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.379
Caption: do this thing very simple and they&#39;re

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.780
Caption: like you can&#39;t do that because we are

00:42:46.379 --> 00:42:50.699
Caption: still figuring out what our container

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:52.560
Caption: strategy is or what our messaging

00:42:50.699 --> 00:42:54.118
Caption: strategy is or and then you&#39;ve got you

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.219
Caption: know a team of Enterprise Architects

00:42:54.118 --> 00:42:57.598
Caption: that will take 12 months to make a

00:42:56.219 --> 00:42:59.760
Caption: ruling on something before you can touch

00:42:57.599 --> 00:43:02.099
Caption: it it&#39;s all very like oh

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.959
Caption: um and that&#39;s super hard

00:43:02.099 --> 00:43:05.520
Caption: um if you&#39;re in that organization and

00:43:03.959 --> 00:43:07.379
Caption: you can ship

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.159
Caption: then

00:43:07.379 --> 00:43:10.858
Caption: um

00:43:08.159 --> 00:43:12.780
Caption: yeah just do small things quickly and

00:43:10.858 --> 00:43:14.639
Caption: again you know in in sort of technical

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:16.319
Caption: stuff HTTP is great like you don&#39;t want

00:43:14.639 --> 00:43:18.299
Caption: to expose like if you&#39;ve got you know

00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:19.440
Caption: active mq or like a message broker back

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.939
Caption: there you probably don&#39;t want to expose

00:43:19.439 --> 00:43:23.459
Caption: that because you want to change your

00:43:20.939 --> 00:43:25.439
Caption: semantics so if you go well this is our

00:43:23.459 --> 00:43:28.199
Caption: boundary is an API that people can

00:43:25.439 --> 00:43:30.118
Caption: request and treat it like a third party

00:43:28.199 --> 00:43:33.118
Caption: um yeah we&#39;d love to hear more about it

00:43:30.118 --> 00:43:35.219
