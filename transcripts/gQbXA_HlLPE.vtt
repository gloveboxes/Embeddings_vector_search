00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.950
Caption: thank you everybody for coming along

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.750
Caption: this morning to my talk I know it&#39;s

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.059
Caption: rough the coffee still hasn&#39;t quite

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.819
Caption: kicked in well the third coffee hasn&#39;t

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:22.618
Caption: quite kicked in yet to start off today I

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:26.129
Caption: want to give a quick shout out to our

00:00:22.618 --> 00:00:28.559
Caption: sponsors without sponsors conferences

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:31.168
Caption: like DDD couldn&#39;t happen or at least

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:34.610
Caption: they wouldn&#39;t be as spectacular as they

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:37.729
Caption: are today so thanks to all of our

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.930
Caption: sponsors both local companies and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:43.349
Caption: interstate for supporting this

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.829
Caption: conference today I want to talk to you

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:49.919
Caption: about CSS green haven&#39;t heard of it is a

00:00:46.828 --> 00:00:52.559
Caption: spec that came to browsers a few years

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:55.259
Caption: ago and has revolutionized the way we

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.280
Caption: build layouts on the web to start off

00:00:55.259 --> 00:01:01.828
Caption: today I want to tell you a little story

00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:06.048
Caption: in the beginning there was darkness and

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:10.078
Caption: emptiness and then Tim berners-lee said

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.539
Caption: let there be Internet the internet was

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.939
Caption: much simpler in those times was just

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.700
Caption: HTML content on a page similar to how

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.319
Caption: you would see in a Word document

00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:21.419
Caption: but pretty soon everybody got sick of

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:24.809
Caption: looking at times new roman&#39; and so Tim

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:27.599
Caption: said let the fonts colors and sizes and

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:32.429
Caption: positions be changeable and then there

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:34.469
Caption: was CSS but before too long this wasn&#39;t

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.169
Caption: good enough either I mean he can&#39;t keep

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:40.169
Caption: us developers happy we wanted to do more

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:43.649
Caption: I was great because then we discovered

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:46.438
Caption: that you could use tables for creating

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.729
Caption: layouts you could break your page up

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.590
Caption: into a grid

00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:52.048
Caption: you could put tables inside the tables

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:54.118
Caption: and merge cells together we finally had

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.958
Caption: better control over how our content was

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.520
Caption: being laid out on the page but before

00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:02.449
Caption: too long we worked out

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:06.019
Caption: although tables inside tables is okay

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:10.470
Caption: tables inside tables inside tables

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:13.539
Caption: inside tables inside tables was not so

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.208
Caption: much fun to work with it&#39;s

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:18.279
Caption: getting really complex and it also made

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:20.408
Caption: it more difficult when we started trying

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:22.869
Caption: to make our websites work on different

00:02:20.408 --> 00:02:24.878
Caption: device sizes which meant we often had to

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:30.458
Caption: build a completely different website for

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:32.229
Caption: mobile so we started using floats this

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:33.720
Caption: was kind of good because it meant we

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:37.628
Caption: were back to following the separation

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.298
Caption: sans principles which says that hTML is

00:02:37.628 --> 00:02:46.358
Caption: for our content and CSS is for how that

00:02:40.298 --> 00:02:50.018
Caption: content looks and fields but before too

00:02:46.358 --> 00:02:54.128
Caption: long we also found that floats weren&#39;t

00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:57.188
Caption: working too well either you had to clear

00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:59.078
Caption: fix everything there were a bunch more

00:02:57.188 --> 00:03:02.649
Caption: container divs to keep floating elements

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:04.988
Caption: together or apart when using media

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:08.289
Caption: queries you often had to reset things or

00:03:04.988 --> 00:03:11.168
Caption: do complex calculations and you had to

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:13.869
Caption: use a lot of important which I know some

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:18.040
Caption: of you think is the answer and it makes

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:20.138
Caption: front-end developers cry so by the time

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:22.779
Caption: we&#39;d memorized how many percent wide

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.959
Caption: each column needed to be in the six

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:28.149
Caption: column grid with a 1% margin we were

00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:30.638
Caption: pretty excited to have flexbox come

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:33.009
Caption: along we didn&#39;t have to do percentage

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:36.159
Caption: math anymore it reduced the number of

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:38.888
Caption: media queries we needed and we were able

00:03:36.158 --> 00:03:41.018
Caption: to easily vertically sent a content

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:45.040
Caption: which is something we hadn&#39;t been able

00:03:41.018 --> 00:03:47.018
Caption: to do since tables we were finally

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:49.929
Caption: starting to get the functionality that

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:52.388
Caption: we needed out of our CSS we no longer

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:54.698
Caption: needed to write complicated code or work

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.310
Caption: with percentages and our code was more

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:59.169
Caption: responsive than ever but although

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:02.078
Caption: flexbox was really good for flowing

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:05.019
Caption: content we had limited control in the

00:04:02.078 --> 00:04:07.509
Caption: cross access and having gaps between

00:04:05.018 --> 00:04:10.869
Caption: items tended to get things a little

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:14.470
Caption: complicated but things were looking up

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:17.348
Caption: we finally had a CSX Technology was

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.880
Caption: built for layout and in the distance we

00:04:17.348 --> 00:04:25.028
Caption: could see the cavalry was on its way in

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.369
Caption: 2017 CSS grid launched in all major

00:04:25.028 --> 00:04:29.259
Caption: browsers this gave us

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:33.040
Caption: everything we&#39;ve been asking for from

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.470
Caption: CSS layouts like flexbox we were able to

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.369
Caption: define a set of constraints and have the

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.709
Caption: browser make our layout responsive but

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:45.250
Caption: we were also able to control that layout

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:48.100
Caption: in two directions with grid we were able

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.739
Caption: to define areas of a layout we&#39;re able

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.440
Caption: to dictate how elements inside of a grid

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:55.720
Caption: behave we could make our code more

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:01.750
Caption: responsive and reduce the code that we

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:03.639
Caption: were writing but everybody asks isn&#39;t

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.359
Caption: this something we already had with

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.880
Caption: tables isn&#39;t CSS grid Justin you are

00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:11.619
Caption: slightly shinier version of the table

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.869
Caption: layout that we&#39;ve been scoffing out for

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:18.910
Caption: years

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:22.000
Caption: no CSS grid is specifically built for

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:26.110
Caption: web layouts whereas tables are something

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.199
Caption: that we used as a hack it&#39;s designed for

00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:32.500
Caption: this use we&#39;re also following the

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:35.619
Caption: separation of concerns principles hTML

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.789
Caption: is for the content and CSS is for how

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:42.190
Caption: that content looks and feels on a page

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:44.529
Caption: now don&#39;t get me wrong tables still have

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.559
Caption: a place but that would be when you&#39;d

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:53.139
Caption: expect to see a table see a table of

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:56.559
Caption: data not for your layout CSS grid also

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:59.529
Caption: helps us to write semantic and logical

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:02.199
Caption: HTML we&#39;re no longer required to write

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:04.989
Caption: our HTML based on how the page design

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.239
Caption: looks like we can write our HTML based

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:11.138
Caption: on the logical flow of the document and

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:13.630
Caption: let CSS rearrange it visually when this

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.610
Caption: is done right it means that our content

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.760
Caption: is more accessible to anybody who&#39;s

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:21.189
Caption: using a screen reader reader mode saving

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.940
Caption: an article for later or any other kind

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.940
Caption: of assistive technology

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:30.820
Caption: thanks to CSS grid it&#39;s now easier and

00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:33.728
Caption: faster to mock up or to build out the

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.190
Caption: layout of an app and to prove that today

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:39.640
Caption: we&#39;re going to build and note-taking out

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.510
Caption: using CSS grid we&#39;ve got a wireframe

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.110
Caption: which tells us how we want our

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:49.250
Caption: look and we&#39;ve got a basic HTML

00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:52.879
Caption: structure now it&#39;s also important to

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.920
Caption: note that this is a semantic HTML

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.050
Caption: structure there are no container divs

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.900
Caption: there is nothing extra this is pure

00:06:57.049 --> 00:07:02.179
Caption: semantic HTML so we don&#39;t know what

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:03.799
Caption: happens next right this is when we spend

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:04.820
Caption: hours fighting with trying to get the

00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:06.769
Caption: layout to work and we&#39;ve got a

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.990
Caption: completely restructure how the HTML

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:13.160
Caption: looks see what happens

00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:17.079
Caption: so our HTML structure loosely looks like

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:19.640
Caption: this except for with some beautiful

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:22.309
Caption: backgrounds and effects so you can see

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.080
Caption: the different elements in a grid to

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:26.000
Caption: start off we&#39;re going to use something

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:29.629
Caption: fairly simple and we&#39;re going to say

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.929
Caption: body display grid which tells the

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:38.270
Caption: browser we&#39;re using grid now this

00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:40.459
Caption: doesn&#39;t do too much it looks exactly as

00:07:38.269 --> 00:07:48.229
Caption: it did before because we haven&#39;t told it

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:50.269
Caption: what a grid looks like you next we want

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:54.470
Caption: to tell the browser how big our grid is

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:56.779
Caption: so if we have a look again at our

00:07:54.470 --> 00:08:01.459
Caption: wireframe we&#39;re going to break our app

00:07:56.779 --> 00:08:03.709
Caption: up into five columns so to define that

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:07.880
Caption: we use the property grid template

00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:09.919
Caption: columns and so here I can write good

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:14.119
Caption: tempeh columns joiner pixels turn pixels

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:17.000
Caption: 200 pixels 200 pixels 200 pixels now I

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:18.889
Caption: said you could write less code it&#39;s grid

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.679
Caption: denied this seems a bit difficult what

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:23.420
Caption: happens if you want a 10 column grid

00:08:20.679 --> 00:08:25.669
Caption: something else great gives us is the

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:29.930
Caption: repeat function so I can instead say

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:33.049
Caption: repeat 5 200 pixels the repeat function

00:08:29.929 --> 00:08:34.909
Caption: allows us to define a number of times to

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:39.080
Caption: repeat something and the size of the

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:42.228
Caption: column that it&#39;s repeating for example 3

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:45.830
Caption: 200 pixels would give us George 200

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:47.570
Caption: pixels 200 pixels 200 pixels great thing

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.910
Caption: about the repeat function is you can use

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:52.400
Caption: whatever units you would like you can

00:08:49.909 --> 00:08:55.489
Caption: use pixels percentage ms ramps for pop

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:59.390
Caption: widths viewport height anything goes

00:08:55.489 --> 00:09:03.260
Caption: you can also use it to define a path for

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:05.270
Caption: example repeat to 10 pixels 20 viewport

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.799
Caption: whets would give you 10 pixels 20

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.730
Caption: viewport width 10 pixels 20 of your

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:15.380
Caption: twits try saying that 10 times quickly

00:09:09.729 --> 00:09:20.958
Caption: so instead of writing with a fixed width

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:24.229
Caption: I could go repeat 5 20 % so that way I

00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:29.359
Caption: don&#39;t have a fixed pixel size of the

00:09:24.229 --> 00:09:31.789
Caption: container will just take 20 percent but

00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:33.950
Caption: then what if I want to change the size

00:09:31.789 --> 00:09:38.469
Caption: of my grid say I want to have 7 colors

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:42.559
Caption: then I&#39;ve got to work out how wide I

00:09:38.469 --> 00:09:49.009
Caption: don&#39;t want to do that math so instead I

00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:51.919
Caption: could say repeat 5 105 now the FI unit

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:54.549
Caption: is another new thing which comes to CSS

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:58.369
Caption: grid and is often used in the place of

00:09:54.549 --> 00:10:00.859
Caption: percentage widths it&#39;s a little bit

00:09:58.369 --> 00:10:03.770
Caption: difficult to explain so I&#39;m going to try

00:10:00.859 --> 00:10:07.278
Caption: and explain it visually say for example

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:12.290
Caption: I have a grid where I have 100 pixels

00:10:07.278 --> 00:10:14.528
Caption: 1fr 50 pixels to Fr I also want to have

00:10:12.289 --> 00:10:17.179
Caption: a gap between each of those columns of

00:10:14.528 --> 00:10:21.169
Caption: 20 pixels we&#39;re going to touch on the

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:24.619
Caption: gap a bit more later so what the FI unit

00:10:21.169 --> 00:10:28.510
Caption: does is it takes 100% of the element

00:10:24.619 --> 00:10:31.309
Caption: widths which in this case is 510 pixels

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:33.588
Caption: and then takes into account any existing

00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:35.900
Caption: content that we&#39;ve set and here we&#39;ve

00:10:33.588 --> 00:10:39.950
Caption: got a hundred pixel column and a 50

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:43.160
Caption: pixel column so that&#39;s 150 pixels it

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:46.820
Caption: then takes into account any gap that

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:50.028
Caption: we&#39;ve got so we&#39;ve got 20 pixel gap

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:55.760
Caption: between 4 columns which means there&#39;s a

00:10:50.028 --> 00:10:59.179
Caption: total gap of 60 pixels it then looks at

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.919
Caption: how many fr-s there are so here we&#39;ve

00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:05.119
Caption: got 1 fr to Fr

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:07.328
Caption: total of 3 fr anybody able to do that

00:11:05.119 --> 00:11:07.328
Caption: mass

00:11:12.309 --> 00:11:20.000
Caption: in this case when FR is equal to hundred

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:25.148
Caption: pixels so that grid would become 100

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:28.148
Caption: pixels 100 pixels 50 pixels 200 pixels

00:11:25.148 --> 00:11:32.510
Caption: sorry if I have a look at my grid again

00:11:28.148 --> 00:11:34.698
Caption: repeat 5 whenever that&#39;s saying that I

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.500
Caption: want to have 5 columns all of which

00:11:34.698 --> 00:11:38.719
Caption: should be equal widths

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.760
Caption: this means that if I change the number

00:11:38.719 --> 00:11:42.379
Caption: of columns in my grid I don&#39;t have to

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.958
Caption: work out the percentage anymore the

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.160
Caption: browser is going to do it for me

00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:49.338
Caption: so if we have a look at what that looks

00:11:46.159 --> 00:11:50.869
Caption: like in our grid you can see our

00:11:49.338 --> 00:11:53.570
Caption: elements have now started to lay

00:11:50.869 --> 00:11:56.328
Caption: themselves out on the grid they&#39;ve taken

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.619
Caption: out four columns out of our five column

00:11:56.328 --> 00:12:00.409
Caption: grid it because there&#39;s only four

00:11:57.619 --> 00:12:02.539
Caption: elements there next we&#39;re going to

00:12:00.409 --> 00:12:06.289
Caption: define the roads so if we have a look at

00:12:02.539 --> 00:12:07.909
Caption: our wireframe again we have three rows

00:12:06.289 --> 00:12:13.009
Caption: here we&#39;ve got the header the main

00:12:07.909 --> 00:12:15.619
Caption: section and then the footer row so we&#39;re

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:18.619
Caption: going to use a similar property grid

00:12:15.619 --> 00:12:24.109
Caption: template rows and I&#39;m just going to

00:12:18.619 --> 00:12:27.409
Caption: define 100 pixels 1fr 20 pixels so fixed

00:12:24.109 --> 00:12:29.919
Caption: header and footer and then the main

00:12:27.409 --> 00:12:29.919
Caption: content

00:12:37.838 --> 00:12:43.458
Caption: next we want to stop placing out

00:12:40.398 --> 00:12:45.229
Caption: elements in the grade so to start off we

00:12:43.458 --> 00:12:48.648
Caption: want to tell it where our head is going

00:12:45.229 --> 00:12:51.409
Caption: to sit so we&#39;re going to define grid of

00:12:48.648 --> 00:12:53.599
Caption: columns stop this says where we want our

00:12:51.409 --> 00:12:56.078
Caption: header to start which is at line one in

00:12:53.599 --> 00:13:01.159
Caption: the grid so right at the very beginning

00:12:56.078 --> 00:13:03.229
Caption: now CSS grid defines each of numbers

00:13:01.159 --> 00:13:05.388
Caption: each of its lines goes right from the

00:13:03.229 --> 00:13:08.388
Caption: beginning one two three four five six

00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:11.388
Caption: but then CSS grid also counts those

00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:14.659
Caption: backwards so minus one when it&#39;s two -

00:13:11.388 --> 00:13:16.549
Caption: three - four - five - six this is really

00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:20.268
Caption: useful because say we want our header to

00:13:16.549 --> 00:13:24.619
Caption: go all the way across the top I could

00:13:20.268 --> 00:13:26.448
Caption: just say one to six but then if I change

00:13:24.619 --> 00:13:28.789
Caption: how many columns wide oh great is I need

00:13:26.448 --> 00:13:34.458
Caption: to change which line it&#39;s going to

00:13:28.789 --> 00:13:37.190
Caption: instead I can say 1 2 minus 1 which is

00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:39.528
Caption: right at the end so it doesn&#39;t matter

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:45.380
Caption: how wide the grid is the head is gonna

00:13:39.528 --> 00:13:48.018
Caption: go from 1 all the way to minus 1 can

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:52.130
Caption: also use the shorthand so grid column 1

00:13:48.018 --> 00:13:53.838
Caption: / - 1 there&#39;s a lot of different ways

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.448
Caption: that you can define the grid column as

00:13:53.838 --> 00:13:58.099
Caption: well it really depends on the situation

00:13:55.448 --> 00:14:01.309
Caption: so for example you can also say grid

00:13:58.099 --> 00:14:04.130
Caption: column span 5 so I want to suspend 5

00:14:01.309 --> 00:14:05.989
Caption: columns but today as we said the header

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:09.880
Caption: should go all the way across the top so

00:14:05.989 --> 00:14:13.549
Caption: we&#39;re gonna say grid column 1 / - 1

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:15.859
Caption: which has now stretched our header all

00:14:13.549 --> 00:14:17.268
Caption: the way across the top you can see the

00:14:15.859 --> 00:14:19.458
Caption: rest of the elements have now been

00:14:17.268 --> 00:14:23.898
Caption: pushed down on to the second row you

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:26.688
Caption: know grid so to get somewhere next we

00:14:23.898 --> 00:14:29.239
Caption: want to assign the nav so we want the

00:14:26.689 --> 00:14:32.180
Caption: nav to take up our just the first column

00:14:29.239 --> 00:14:35.359
Caption: but the second and third row so we&#39;re

00:14:32.179 --> 00:14:37.698
Caption: going to define read row span - so we

00:14:35.359 --> 00:14:40.130
Caption: want it to span two rows we don&#39;t need

00:14:37.698 --> 00:14:43.429
Caption: to define read column cuz it&#39;s only

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:46.189
Caption: gonna spend one column so you can see

00:14:43.429 --> 00:14:48.369
Caption: our nav has now pushed down on to the

00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:52.160
Caption: bottom row as well

00:14:48.369 --> 00:14:54.648
Caption: next we want to assign our main content

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:57.919
Caption: so that&#39;s where our main note is and

00:14:54.648 --> 00:15:00.260
Caption: we&#39;re gonna say main grid column span

00:14:57.919 --> 00:15:02.719
Caption: before we want it to spend four columns

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.338
Caption: which pushes that all the way out and

00:15:02.719 --> 00:15:09.648
Caption: then you can see the footer has been

00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:11.059
Caption: pushed down to the bottom finally we

00:15:09.648 --> 00:15:13.190
Caption: want our foot out to take up the

00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:17.000
Caption: remainder of the grid so we&#39;re gonna say

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:18.559
Caption: grid column span four and you can see

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.578
Caption: the footer has now pushed all the way

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:24.458
Caption: out to the end and filled our grid in

00:15:21.578 --> 00:15:27.588
Caption: now one of the other useful things about

00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:29.690
Caption: CSS grid is it gives us the ability to

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:32.000
Caption: name these areas which makes it a bit

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:34.630
Caption: easier for when laying elements out in

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.359
Caption: your grid so once we&#39;ve defined our

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:41.630
Caption: columns and rows we can also use grid

00:15:38.359 --> 00:15:43.820
Caption: template areas and actually assign names

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.250
Caption: to them and where different areas are

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.949
Caption: combining so for example you can see

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:54.109
Caption: here there&#39;s one word for each column

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:56.179
Caption: and one row for one line for each row in

00:15:54.109 --> 00:15:58.369
Caption: our grid the top should be all header

00:15:56.179 --> 00:16:01.039
Caption: the name should be the first column of

00:15:58.369 --> 00:16:03.979
Caption: the second and third row the note should

00:16:01.039 --> 00:16:05.838
Caption: go the rest of the way along second row

00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:07.698
Caption: and the footer should go the rest of the

00:16:05.838 --> 00:16:10.010
Caption: way along the bottom row

00:16:07.698 --> 00:16:12.198
Caption: this is really good because it makes it

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:15.708
Caption: much easier when you&#39;re rearranging a

00:16:12.198 --> 00:16:18.708
Caption: layout you can just rearrange the grid

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:22.159
Caption: template areas here once we&#39;ve defined

00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:24.409
Caption: these we then go through and assign grid

00:16:22.159 --> 00:16:27.469
Caption: areas to each of our elements in the

00:16:24.409 --> 00:16:31.219
Caption: grid henna grid area header now grid

00:16:27.469 --> 00:16:33.198
Caption: area now naming things is hard Maine is

00:16:31.219 --> 00:16:35.989
Caption: grid area no it&#39;s just to be a little

00:16:33.198 --> 00:16:41.328
Caption: bit different and footer is red area

00:16:35.989 --> 00:16:45.440
Caption: footer so this will look pretty much

00:16:41.328 --> 00:16:47.659
Caption: exactly like what it did before now this

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:50.479
Caption: is where one of the useful tools for CSS

00:16:47.659 --> 00:16:52.568
Caption: crude comes into play anybody here use

00:16:50.479 --> 00:16:55.219
Caption: Firefox as their main tab browser if

00:16:52.568 --> 00:16:57.559
Caption: you&#39;re using CSS grid you need to

00:16:55.219 --> 00:17:00.648
Caption: install it and use it because they have

00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:01.939
Caption: a grid inspector tool which is amazing

00:17:00.648 --> 00:17:03.588
Caption: particularly when you&#39;re getting

00:17:01.939 --> 00:17:06.649
Caption: started and then even when you use it

00:17:03.588 --> 00:17:07.818
Caption: every day degra inspector tool is

00:17:06.649 --> 00:17:11.739
Caption: fantastic

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:14.688
Caption: Firefox gritty inspector allows you to

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:16.308
Caption: allows you to inspect your grid and have

00:17:14.688 --> 00:17:19.038
Caption: a look at what&#39;s going on you can

00:17:16.308 --> 00:17:23.208
Caption: overlay any named areas you can see

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:24.648
Caption: lines it is a complete life changer if

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:32.500
Caption: you&#39;re using grid so make sure you&#39;re

00:17:24.649 --> 00:17:38.600
Caption: using that so basic layout over app done

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:41.538
Caption: in seven lines of CSS and about ten

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:46.939
Caption: minutes that&#39;s pretty impressive anybody

00:17:41.538 --> 00:17:49.459
Caption: think that was but if we have a look at

00:17:46.939 --> 00:17:50.778
Caption: our wireframe again what we actually

00:17:49.459 --> 00:17:53.119
Caption: wanted in the middle so we actually

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:56.570
Caption: wanted our note to take up most of the

00:17:53.119 --> 00:17:58.489
Caption: section but it had a little sidebar

00:17:56.569 --> 00:18:02.778
Caption: there as well where a lot of the meta

00:17:58.489 --> 00:18:05.119
Caption: info and all of the tags are but if you

00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:06.950
Caption: have a look that&#39;s not really what it

00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:11.178
Caption: looks like right now so those are still

00:18:06.949 --> 00:18:14.000
Caption: taking up the main section the middle we

00:18:11.178 --> 00:18:17.388
Caption: want the article to take up just the

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.779
Caption: first three columns and side by to taper

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:23.509
Caption: fourth column so here we can use another

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:27.639
Caption: property which we would apply to the

00:18:23.509 --> 00:18:31.009
Caption: main element which is display contents

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:32.629
Caption: now what display contents does is so if

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:35.239
Caption: we have a look at our main element here

00:18:32.629 --> 00:18:37.639
Caption: got a main element inside of that is an

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:39.649
Caption: article and a side element and both of

00:18:37.639 --> 00:18:43.299
Caption: those have their own content inside of

00:18:39.649 --> 00:18:45.799
Caption: it what display contents does is

00:18:43.298 --> 00:18:48.979
Caption: basically makes that main element

00:18:45.798 --> 00:18:51.739
Caption: disappear and so article and a side then

00:18:48.979 --> 00:18:54.979
Caption: become children of the grid instead of

00:18:51.739 --> 00:19:00.079
Caption: main element so if we assign display

00:18:54.979 --> 00:19:02.959
Caption: contents to the main element that will

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:05.418
Caption: then make article and a side take up

00:19:02.959 --> 00:19:07.548
Caption: there or in separate columns in the grid

00:19:05.418 --> 00:19:10.038
Caption: rather than taking up the full section

00:19:07.548 --> 00:19:12.518
Caption: and we can then place them similarly to

00:19:10.038 --> 00:19:15.778
Caption: how we placed the rest of the elements

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:18.450
Caption: so we can reject our

00:19:15.779 --> 00:19:21.029
Caption: template areas here so the middle row

00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:23.428
Caption: instead of being note note note note it

00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:26.309
Caption: should just be no no sigh note note

00:19:23.428 --> 00:19:28.589
Caption: notes sidebar so that notes takes up

00:19:26.308 --> 00:19:33.268
Caption: three columns sidebar takes up the final

00:19:28.589 --> 00:19:37.499
Caption: column we can then assign a grid area to

00:19:33.269 --> 00:19:39.690
Caption: article and a side and that pushes the

00:19:37.499 --> 00:19:44.098
Caption: article out and keeps the sidebar in the

00:19:39.689 --> 00:19:50.418
Caption: end that&#39;s pretty cool one thing that&#39;s

00:19:44.098 --> 00:19:54.808
Caption: worth noting though is so there&#39;s a bug

00:19:50.418 --> 00:19:58.288
Caption: and it so it&#39;s not meant to happen and

00:19:54.808 --> 00:20:00.838
Caption: it&#39;s only in some browsers but in some

00:19:58.288 --> 00:20:03.238
Caption: browsers when you apply display contents

00:20:00.838 --> 00:20:05.639
Caption: to an element for example the main

00:20:03.239 --> 00:20:09.419
Caption: element it makes the whole thing

00:20:05.639 --> 00:20:11.098
Caption: disappear including the children so you

00:20:09.418 --> 00:20:14.008
Caption: know how display contents is meant to do

00:20:11.098 --> 00:20:18.409
Caption: this in these browsers according to

00:20:14.009 --> 00:20:18.409
Caption: screen readers it does this

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:24.349
Caption: so it will still appear on the page so

00:20:22.339 --> 00:20:26.209
Caption: when you&#39;re looking at it you may look

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:28.339
Caption: at it and go it&#39;s fine the contents

00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:30.709
Caption: there it&#39;s fine but if you&#39;re not

00:20:28.339 --> 00:20:32.270
Caption: testing with screen readers the screen

00:20:30.709 --> 00:20:34.609
Caption: reader doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s there it

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:37.670
Caption: doesn&#39;t announce it and so anybody who&#39;s

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:41.589
Caption: using assistive technology won&#39;t get

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:43.700
Caption: anything that&#39;s inside of that element

00:20:41.589 --> 00:20:46.039
Caption: there&#39;s a bit more information about

00:20:43.699 --> 00:20:48.500
Caption: what&#39;s going on with this hearing this

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:50.960
Caption: really great article by Adrian Roselli I

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:53.089
Caption: don&#39;t worry about taking notes of all of

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:55.699
Caption: these resources they will be tweeted out

00:20:53.089 --> 00:21:00.229
Caption: hands-free as I&#39;m going along and also

00:20:55.699 --> 00:21:03.199
Caption: on my slides at the end the gist of this

00:21:00.229 --> 00:21:04.910
Caption: article though is just don&#39;t go messing

00:21:03.199 --> 00:21:07.939
Caption: with the dot don&#39;t don&#39;t play with the

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:12.559
Caption: Dom thankfully there is a better

00:21:07.939 --> 00:21:14.169
Caption: alternative CSS subgrid has come to the

00:21:12.558 --> 00:21:18.709
Caption: rescue

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:21.530
Caption: so we want we want out layout to look

00:21:18.709 --> 00:21:24.829
Caption: like this rather than making the main

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:26.869
Caption: element disappear we can just as we can

00:21:24.829 --> 00:21:30.799
Caption: just align the article and a side

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:33.319
Caption: elements as part of the main grid now

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.600
Caption: you can define a separate grid on main

00:21:33.319 --> 00:21:37.669
Caption: and just completely do it that way which

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:39.410
Caption: is fine but then if you change the size

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:41.330
Caption: of the overall parent grid you go to

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:44.179
Caption: change the size of the child grid it

00:21:41.329 --> 00:21:47.359
Caption: gets complicated sub grid allows you to

00:21:44.178 --> 00:21:50.630
Caption: define it so that it aligns with the

00:21:47.359 --> 00:21:53.270
Caption: parent grid so if we take our grid

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:55.670
Caption: template areas back here so where it

00:21:53.270 --> 00:22:01.400
Caption: says note note note note all the way

00:21:55.670 --> 00:22:03.650
Caption: along where it was looking like that we

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:08.690
Caption: then want to instead of display contents

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:10.969
Caption: we want to say display grip so that

00:22:08.689 --> 00:22:15.250
Caption: looks like that that&#39;s now filling out

00:22:10.969 --> 00:22:15.250
Caption: the whole area that it&#39;s got

00:22:18.349 --> 00:22:25.380
Caption: now rather than defining that this grid

00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:27.058
Caption: should be four columns wide and then

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.010
Caption: having to redefine it when the parent

00:22:27.058 --> 00:22:32.668
Caption: grid changes what we can instead do is

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:34.739
Caption: say grid template columns sub grid so we

00:22:32.668 --> 00:22:38.369
Caption: want it to take into account however

00:22:34.739 --> 00:22:41.849
Caption: many columns the main element does you

00:22:38.369 --> 00:22:45.329
Caption: have a look yeah you can see our article

00:22:41.849 --> 00:22:48.538
Caption: and aside have now taken places as part

00:22:45.329 --> 00:22:52.288
Caption: of the parent grid even though their

00:22:48.538 --> 00:22:55.589
Caption: grandchildren elements all we have to do

00:22:52.288 --> 00:22:57.479
Caption: then is a sign where article and a side

00:22:55.589 --> 00:23:00.298
Caption: would sit inside of that sub grid sir

00:22:57.479 --> 00:23:04.530
Caption: article grid column span three and

00:23:00.298 --> 00:23:08.389
Caption: that&#39;s pushed it way out so this one

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:08.390
Caption: will work with screen readers

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:14.459
Caption: now subgrade is still relatively new

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:16.619
Caption: there&#39;s lots of information about it

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:18.178
Caption: though the Mozilla dev Doc&#39;s are

00:23:16.619 --> 00:23:21.900
Caption: fantastic they&#39;ve got lots of

00:23:18.178 --> 00:23:23.788
Caption: information also Rachel Andrew has a lot

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.780
Caption: of really great blog posts and talks on

00:23:23.788 --> 00:23:27.869
Caption: it if you&#39;re looking for a more

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:30.840
Caption: information one of the other questions

00:23:27.869 --> 00:23:33.270
Caption: that comes up with grid is does it

00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:35.579
Caption: replace flexbox if I haven&#39;t learnt

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:37.380
Caption: either of them can I just learn three

00:23:35.579 --> 00:23:39.538
Caption: then don&#39;t have to worry about flexbox

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:44.539
Caption: do I not use flexbox do I just use grid

00:23:39.538 --> 00:23:47.668
Caption: everywhere now let me ask you a question

00:23:44.538 --> 00:23:54.009
Caption: batgirls pretty awesome right she kicks

00:23:47.668 --> 00:23:57.039
Caption: ass black is also pretty awesome

00:23:54.010 --> 00:24:03.239
Caption: but do we question whether or not we

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:09.460
Caption: only need one of them no they form a

00:24:03.239 --> 00:24:13.020
Caption: super crime-fighting duo so CSS grid is

00:24:09.459 --> 00:24:16.270
Caption: really awesome as great for layouts and

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:18.640
Caption: face box is also really awesome and it&#39;s

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:21.849
Caption: great for flowing content and centering

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:26.440
Caption: things vertically which is massive over

00:24:21.849 --> 00:24:31.119
Caption: use of a fairly technical spec so

00:24:26.439 --> 00:24:37.149
Caption: therefore grid and flex box form a super

00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:40.209
Caption: CSS layout do it these two specs both

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:41.859
Caption: complement each other yes you could

00:24:40.209 --> 00:24:44.589
Caption: replace everything with Flex box with

00:24:41.859 --> 00:24:48.160
Caption: grid but a lot of the time it&#39;s overkill

00:24:44.589 --> 00:24:50.140
Caption: if I&#39;m doing something like a navbar

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.489
Caption: I&#39;m gonna go flex box every time if I&#39;m

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.190
Caption: trying to send her something vertically

00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:56.199
Caption: see me flex box but if I&#39;m building out

00:24:54.189 --> 00:24:59.709
Caption: the layout of an app then yes I&#39;m going

00:24:56.199 --> 00:25:01.209
Caption: to use CSS grid it&#39;s worth using both of

00:24:59.709 --> 00:25:10.630
Caption: them and knowing which one you should

00:25:01.209 --> 00:25:13.109
Caption: use when now if I take away all of my

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:16.209
Caption: beautiful background colors and effects

00:25:13.109 --> 00:25:20.229
Caption: this is looking pretty good I mean I

00:25:16.209 --> 00:25:22.270
Caption: wouldn&#39;t say ship it but we&#39;ve got a

00:25:20.229 --> 00:25:25.270
Caption: pretty good actor there

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:26.669
Caption: and considering how much code we&#39;ve

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:29.349
Caption: written that&#39;s pretty impressive

00:25:26.668 --> 00:25:33.789
Caption: but this is okay while I&#39;ve only got a

00:25:29.349 --> 00:25:36.189
Caption: couple of notes I really want an overall

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:39.400
Caption: view where I can see them all at once so

00:25:36.189 --> 00:25:43.569
Caption: we&#39;re gonna build a different view where

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:46.750
Caption: we&#39;ve got cards so to do this again

00:25:43.569 --> 00:25:51.009
Caption: we&#39;re going to define columns so we&#39;re

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:55.928
Caption: gonna say grid template columns 100 300

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:58.619
Caption: pixels now this is okay but this means

00:25:55.928 --> 00:26:02.349
Caption: don&#39;t grid these feet 3,000 pixels wide

00:25:58.619 --> 00:26:05.400
Caption: it&#39;s not very responsive is it so

00:26:02.349 --> 00:26:07.219
Caption: instead I&#39;m gonna say repeat autofill

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:13.019
Caption: surrounded pixels

00:26:07.219 --> 00:26:15.089
Caption: now autofill is something else that

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:15.769
Caption: comes with the repeat function there&#39;s

00:26:15.089 --> 00:26:19.558
Caption: two of them

00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:22.049
Caption: autofill and autofit and there&#39;s a

00:26:19.558 --> 00:26:24.599
Caption: really great visual representation in

00:26:22.048 --> 00:26:28.709
Caption: its code penned by sarasota which shows

00:26:24.599 --> 00:26:31.379
Caption: them now autofill fills the row as many

00:26:28.709 --> 00:26:33.538
Caption: columns as it can fit even if you don&#39;t

00:26:31.379 --> 00:26:36.929
Caption: have enough elements to fill them

00:26:33.538 --> 00:26:38.758
Caption: whereas auto fit put in as many column

00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:41.668
Caption: as many columns as it needs for the

00:26:38.759 --> 00:26:44.639
Caption: elements and then stretches them out to

00:26:41.668 --> 00:26:46.918
Caption: take up the extra space or you can just

00:26:44.639 --> 00:26:49.799
Caption: do what I do and just flick between the

00:26:46.918 --> 00:26:52.949
Caption: two them until it does the one that you

00:26:49.798 --> 00:26:54.359
Caption: want to do this is like the one thing I

00:26:52.949 --> 00:26:59.219
Caption: still have to read off my slides because

00:26:54.359 --> 00:27:01.979
Caption: I could not switch so if I say repeat

00:26:59.219 --> 00:27:07.109
Caption: autofill anyone remember which one that

00:27:01.979 --> 00:27:09.178
Caption: does as many columns as you can fit even

00:27:07.109 --> 00:27:11.489
Caption: if we&#39;re not going to need them so

00:27:09.178 --> 00:27:14.479
Caption: repeat autofill hundred pixels it&#39;s many

00:27:11.489 --> 00:27:17.428
Caption: hundred pixel columns as you can fit in

00:27:14.479 --> 00:27:20.099
Caption: so if we have a look at our columns we

00:27:17.428 --> 00:27:22.408
Caption: say autofill 300 pixels as many 300

00:27:20.099 --> 00:27:27.028
Caption: pixel columns as you can fit even if

00:27:22.409 --> 00:27:29.909
Caption: we&#39;re not going to need them but then we

00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:32.009
Caption: may what happens if we&#39;ve got say 250

00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:33.869
Caption: pixels left over that&#39;s not enough for a

00:27:32.009 --> 00:27:35.789
Caption: column and our grids not going to line

00:27:33.869 --> 00:27:37.889
Caption: up with everything else which may be

00:27:35.788 --> 00:27:40.408
Caption: okay but the designer says everything&#39;s

00:27:37.889 --> 00:27:44.779
Caption: got to line up perfectly so instead

00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:50.999
Caption: we&#39;re gonna say repeat autofill min/max

00:27:44.779 --> 00:27:53.720
Caption: 300 pixels when fr now min max does what

00:27:50.999 --> 00:27:58.889
Caption: you&#39;d expect it to it defines a minimum

00:27:53.719 --> 00:28:02.249
Caption: maximum again you can use any unit you

00:27:58.889 --> 00:28:05.039
Caption: like pixels M&#39;s ramps percentage report

00:28:02.249 --> 00:28:07.200
Caption: wits if you put Heights the FI unit we

00:28:05.038 --> 00:28:10.979
Caption: learned earlier you can use them all so

00:28:07.199 --> 00:28:14.989
Caption: minimum of 100 pixels maximum of 20 whew

00:28:10.979 --> 00:28:19.459
Caption: port widths minimum of 100 pixels

00:28:14.989 --> 00:28:20.569
Caption: maximum of 1f our minimum of 1f our

00:28:19.459 --> 00:28:24.949
Caption: maximum

00:28:20.569 --> 00:28:28.009
Caption: 300 pixels these all work so I can go

00:28:24.949 --> 00:28:30.979
Caption: repeat autofill as many columns as we

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:34.010
Caption: can fit even if we don&#39;t need them min

00:28:30.979 --> 00:28:36.619
Caption: max 300 pixels so there should be 300

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:39.079
Caption: pixels wide at least but then expand out

00:28:36.619 --> 00:28:42.530
Caption: to take extra space that means if we

00:28:39.079 --> 00:28:44.149
Caption: have 250 pixels left over it&#39;s going to

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:48.849
Caption: expand to make sure the grid aligns

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:51.290
Caption: where it should so you can see here our

00:28:48.849 --> 00:28:57.260
Caption: cards have now taken their places

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:58.700
Caption: columns but nice little compact cards

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:01.310
Caption: that looks really weird so we&#39;re gonna

00:28:58.699 --> 00:29:03.380
Caption: define group rows as well and when you

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:05.780
Caption: say grid template rows repeat or don&#39;t

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.369
Caption: fill as many as we can fit even if we

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:11.390
Caption: don&#39;t need them and they&#39;re just gonna

00:29:07.369 --> 00:29:14.839
Caption: be 150 pixels high that&#39;s not bad

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:19.190
Caption: nice little cards but they&#39;re fairly

00:29:14.839 --> 00:29:20.809
Caption: cramped so we want to add a gap between

00:29:19.189 --> 00:29:22.549
Caption: them and so this is where we&#39;re going to

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:25.790
Caption: use the gap property that we touched on

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:29.780
Caption: earlier and so I wanted to fine grid a

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:32.119
Caption: column gap 20 pixels so this says that

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:35.420
Caption: between each of the columns I want a 20

00:29:32.119 --> 00:29:37.309
Caption: pixels gap I then want to have a gap

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:41.510
Caption: between each of the rows so I&#39;m gonna

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:43.700
Caption: say grid where gap 20 pixels or I can

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:46.430
Caption: use the shorthand and just say grid gap

00:29:43.699 --> 00:29:48.889
Caption: 20 pixels because I want it to be the

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:53.570
Caption: same gap between each row and each

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:56.239
Caption: column now one question people often ask

00:29:53.569 --> 00:29:58.630
Caption: is will work why can&#39;t I just use

00:29:56.239 --> 00:30:03.770
Caption: margins I can just use margins for that

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:05.719
Caption: because margins have issues for this so

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:09.560
Caption: you&#39;ve probably encountered things like

00:30:05.719 --> 00:30:11.209
Caption: this where you things putting a margin

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.920
Caption: means it doesn&#39;t line up properly so

00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:14.539
Caption: you&#39;ve got to add a negative margin so

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.790
Caption: the children are out where they should

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:19.130
Caption: be or you get to do these lovely and

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:20.479
Caption: child recipes where well every fifth one

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:22.430
Caption: shouldn&#39;t have one on the right and

00:30:20.479 --> 00:30:24.020
Caption: every fifth one plus one shouldn&#39;t have

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.280
Caption: one on the left and the first five

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.330
Caption: shouldn&#39;t have one on the top and the

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.690
Caption: last five shouldn&#39;t have one on the

00:30:26.329 --> 00:30:28.399
Caption: bottom

00:30:26.689 --> 00:30:32.500
Caption: which then changes when your grid

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.500
Caption: changes sides or

00:30:32.849 --> 00:30:40.558
Caption: grid gap 20 pixels so if we add that

00:30:38.428 --> 00:30:45.569
Caption: we&#39;re now starting to get nice little

00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:47.638
Caption: gaps between each of our cards now this

00:30:45.569 --> 00:30:49.678
Caption: is where we can also have a look at five

00:30:47.639 --> 00:30:52.380
Caption: hooks this grid inspector again and we

00:30:49.678 --> 00:30:54.209
Caption: can see these are all the spaces we&#39;ve

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:57.389
Caption: got in our grid even though we don&#39;t

00:30:54.209 --> 00:30:59.038
Caption: actually need them and you can also see

00:30:57.389 --> 00:31:02.009
Caption: the gap between each of them

00:30:59.038 --> 00:31:04.018
Caption: so again if you doing grid use Firefox&#39;s

00:31:02.009 --> 00:31:06.830
Caption: grid inspector I swear they&#39;re not

00:31:04.019 --> 00:31:09.269
Caption: paying me I just believe in it that much

00:31:06.829 --> 00:31:15.089
Caption: now again if we take away all my

00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:20.730
Caption: beautiful colors it&#39;s not bad right it&#39;s

00:31:15.089 --> 00:31:23.609
Caption: pretty good now is it just me what is

00:31:20.729 --> 00:31:26.518
Caption: this sound too good to be true like this

00:31:23.609 --> 00:31:28.408
Caption: would clearly make our lives easier

00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:35.669
Caption: what&#39;s the catch

00:31:28.409 --> 00:31:38.519
Caption: what am I not mentioning yeah so it&#39;s

00:31:35.668 --> 00:31:41.308
Caption: better it&#39;s better than you might think

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:45.029
Caption: so as I said this has been around since

00:31:41.308 --> 00:31:47.219
Caption: 2017 and for the first time it kind of

00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:48.750
Caption: all happened at once because CSS grid

00:31:47.219 --> 00:31:50.638
Caption: was actually developed under a feature

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:53.308
Caption: flag which meant that when we were all

00:31:50.639 --> 00:31:56.580
Caption: getting it all the kinks were pretty

00:31:53.308 --> 00:32:03.239
Caption: much ironed out so chrome has had it

00:31:56.579 --> 00:32:07.979
Caption: since 57 Firefox since 52 Safari since

00:32:03.239 --> 00:32:11.839
Caption: 10.1 edge since 16 and with it that&#39;s

00:32:07.979 --> 00:32:11.839
Caption: that&#39;s all the browsers writers

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:31.969
Caption: so I sort of so I II was actually the

00:32:29.329 --> 00:32:35.839
Caption: first browser to implement CSS grit I

00:32:31.969 --> 00:32:40.400
Caption: know right mind-blowing but they did it

00:32:35.839 --> 00:32:42.739
Caption: way way back when it was a completely

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.260
Caption: different version of spec and because

00:32:42.739 --> 00:32:48.770
Caption: it&#39;s no look I maintained and it hasn&#39;t

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:50.829
Caption: actually been updated so ie does a

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.808
Caption: completely different thing with

00:32:50.829 --> 00:32:56.089
Caption: depending on what you&#39;re doing it may

00:32:53.808 --> 00:32:58.459
Caption: still work for you you can find their

00:32:56.089 --> 00:33:00.949
Caption: version of the spec if you&#39;re bored or

00:32:58.459 --> 00:33:04.428
Caption: really procrastinating or have

00:33:00.949 --> 00:33:07.939
Caption: difficulty sleeping and find out to see

00:33:04.428 --> 00:33:10.510
Caption: if that would work for you otherwise it

00:33:07.939 --> 00:33:12.500
Caption: may be best to just leave it alone now

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:15.829
Caption: what are these numbers actually mean

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:18.469
Caption: well globally we&#39;re looking at 91%

00:33:15.829 --> 00:33:23.359
Caption: support for CSS grid that&#39;s pretty good

00:33:18.469 --> 00:33:25.010
Caption: right um so so you know how we use sub

00:33:23.359 --> 00:33:27.589
Caption: grid before the really cool thing that

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:37.190
Caption: changed everything and was just really

00:33:27.589 --> 00:33:39.529
Caption: great so um what I didn&#39;t mention so the

00:33:37.189 --> 00:33:43.759
Caption: sub grid launched about two months ago

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:48.890
Caption: in Firefox nightly not even Firefox dev

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:50.780
Caption: version firefox nightly only so you

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:54.979
Caption: definitely cannot use these in

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:57.799
Caption: production but it is available to start

00:33:54.979 --> 00:33:59.298
Caption: playing around with so I got to use it

00:33:57.798 --> 00:34:01.399
Caption: myself for the first time when I was

00:33:59.298 --> 00:34:03.199
Caption: updating this talk a few months ago I

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:06.200
Caption: was really exciting to get to do

00:34:03.199 --> 00:34:07.909
Caption: something so new so download Firefox

00:34:06.199 --> 00:34:12.168
Caption: nightly and have a look if you&#39;re

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:14.418
Caption: interested remember flex box has been

00:34:12.168 --> 00:34:19.760
Caption: around for a while longer so their

00:34:14.418 --> 00:34:22.040
Caption: supports looking fairly good 98% and in

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.439
Caption: my opinion there is two percent

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:28.418
Caption: remaining they can deal with it there is

00:34:24.439 --> 00:34:28.418
Caption: two percent a user websites not

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:35.300
Caption: one of the other great things we have

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:37.070
Caption: with this is the supports query so the

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:40.879
Caption: supports query if you haven&#39;t used it

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:44.510
Caption: before is a CSS query that allows us to

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:48.338
Caption: define a CSS property and a value and

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:48.339
Caption: then code it inside of it

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:54.829
Caption: and if the browser doesn&#39;t know what to

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:59.860
Caption: do with the property in value

00:34:54.830 --> 00:35:02.150
Caption: it won&#39;t use the code now supports is

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:04.040
Caption: fairly new like it&#39;s been around for a

00:35:02.149 --> 00:35:06.199
Caption: while but it is still failing you the

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:08.449
Caption: great thing is if a browser doesn&#39;t know

00:35:06.199 --> 00:35:10.070
Caption: what to do with supports there is no way

00:35:08.449 --> 00:35:11.510
Caption: it&#39;s gonna know what to do with grid and

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:19.790
Caption: it&#39;s just gonna ignore the whole lot

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:21.949
Caption: anyway so for example I can say supports

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:24.080
Caption: display grid I can put my grid code

00:35:21.949 --> 00:35:26.659
Caption: inside of this and if a browser doesn&#39;t

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.700
Caption: know what to do with that it&#39;s not gonna

00:35:26.659 --> 00:35:29.929
Caption: use the grid code this is really useful

00:35:28.699 --> 00:35:32.419
Caption: because it means we&#39;re not delivering

00:35:29.929 --> 00:35:33.739
Caption: code to browsers where they&#39;re not

00:35:32.419 --> 00:35:37.369
Caption: supporting the properties that we&#39;re

00:35:33.739 --> 00:35:41.510
Caption: using there is one issue with this so

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:44.690
Caption: cuz remember this guy sorry if you give

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:46.699
Caption: it supports display grid are you guys I

00:35:44.689 --> 00:35:51.079
Caption: know this I know this one I know son I

00:35:46.699 --> 00:35:53.510
Caption: can do it I got it except it&#39;s using a

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.130
Caption: completely different spec so depending

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:57.500
Caption: on what properties you&#39;re using it&#39;s

00:35:55.129 --> 00:35:59.269
Caption: it&#39;s got no clue what any of the code

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.770
Caption: inside of your supports query is doing

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:03.530
Caption: or it does something completely

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:05.750
Caption: different to what you&#39;re expecting the

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:07.939
Caption: great thing is though you can instead do

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:10.550
Caption: a supports query for a property that it

00:36:07.939 --> 00:36:12.859
Caption: doesn&#39;t support for example grid

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:14.900
Caption: template areas you don&#39;t actually need

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:17.450
Caption: to define areas you can just say dot to

00:36:14.899 --> 00:36:20.569
Caption: say there is an area and I look at this

00:36:17.449 --> 00:36:24.479
Caption: and go no no clue and it will leave it

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:28.320
Caption: all alone so

00:36:24.479 --> 00:36:32.219
Caption: what you can do is just sew supports

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:34.290
Caption: display supports grid template areas and

00:36:32.219 --> 00:36:35.939
Caption: then put all of your grid code inside of

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.439
Caption: it that means that any of those browsers

00:36:35.939 --> 00:36:41.328
Caption: that don&#39;t know what to do with it

00:36:37.439 --> 00:36:41.328
Caption: they&#39;re just not going to touch it this

00:36:41.868 --> 00:36:48.118
Caption: is pretty awesome right this is exciting

00:36:45.329 --> 00:36:50.250
Caption: you can use this you can go back I know

00:36:48.118 --> 00:36:52.739
Caption: you can all go back to your team you can

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:54.899
Caption: go yes I learn about this thing was a

00:36:52.739 --> 00:36:56.879
Caption: really amazing talk that I totally rated

00:36:54.899 --> 00:37:00.059
Caption: five stars for it gave really great

00:36:56.879 --> 00:37:03.389
Caption: feedback and we should start using this

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:06.020
Caption: now and I know exactly what your team is

00:37:03.389 --> 00:37:06.019
Caption: going to say

00:37:06.419 --> 00:37:16.739
Caption: but so today I&#39;m gonna give you answers

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:23.519
Caption: so that BOTS but there&#39;s not enough

00:37:16.739 --> 00:37:24.000
Caption: support 91 percent that&#39;s pretty good

00:37:23.519 --> 00:37:26.339
Caption: support

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.229
Caption: it is completely depends on your UK use

00:37:26.339 --> 00:37:33.839
Caption: case anyone from Bank West I&#39;m really

00:37:28.229 --> 00:37:35.669
Caption: sorry I know you can&#39;t use this I used

00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:38.910
Caption: to work at banquets it&#39;s fine I know the

00:37:35.669 --> 00:37:42.000
Caption: deal you&#39;ve also got the supports query

00:37:38.909 --> 00:37:46.199
Caption: so remember if someone doesn&#39;t support

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:50.010
Caption: it they&#39;re not gonna get grid code but

00:37:46.199 --> 00:37:52.409
Caption: then we have to write a fallback does

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:57.630
Caption: your layout currently work in those

00:37:52.409 --> 00:38:00.479
Caption: browsers you&#39;ve only got one your

00:37:57.629 --> 00:38:02.518
Caption: current code is your fallback you can

00:38:00.479 --> 00:38:04.588
Caption: just write a great alternative and tired

00:38:02.519 --> 00:38:08.369
Caption: of it supports free now will only go to

00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:14.849
Caption: the browsers that can do it but we don&#39;t

00:38:08.368 --> 00:38:16.139
Caption: have time to do all of that the secret

00:38:14.849 --> 00:38:19.730
Caption: is you don&#39;t actually have to use this

00:38:16.139 --> 00:38:23.328
Caption: everywhere pick one thing

00:38:19.729 --> 00:38:26.530
Caption: the blog page one particular layout in a

00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:32.440
Caption: part of your application or website

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:32.439
Caption: implement grid down then go from there

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:41.109
Caption: but then will have to maintain it who

00:38:37.608 --> 00:38:41.108
Caption: here uses bootstrap at work

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:52.369
Caption: guess what CSS grid is CSS there aren&#39;t

00:38:48.858 --> 00:38:54.649
Caption: frameworks to update and maintain and

00:38:52.368 --> 00:38:57.529
Caption: check to see whether or not something&#39;s

00:38:54.649 --> 00:38:59.358
Caption: broken this will literally take less

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:05.959
Caption: time to maintain than whatever you&#39;re

00:38:59.358 --> 00:39:07.909
Caption: using now it&#39;s just CSS so to sum up my

00:39:05.959 --> 00:39:10.939
Caption: talk I can&#39;t cover the really amazing

00:39:07.909 --> 00:39:15.949
Caption: points the really important points CSS

00:39:10.939 --> 00:39:20.358
Caption: grid is awesome though is it right was

00:39:15.949 --> 00:39:25.068
Caption: it yeah no in all seriousness CSS grid

00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:27.139
Caption: is amazing it is fantastic to use it

00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:29.479
Caption: makes your life easier there are so

00:39:27.139 --> 00:39:32.209
Caption: times when I realize I can use grid for

00:39:29.479 --> 00:39:34.909
Caption: something or a particular use case I can

00:39:32.209 --> 00:39:37.639
Caption: I can do this grid and there&#39;s a mic
